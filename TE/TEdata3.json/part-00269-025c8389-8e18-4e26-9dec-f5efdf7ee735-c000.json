{"value":"The box for \"To Die For\" suckered me in -- a shirtless hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex. There was plenty of Thomas Arklie (Simon), who's easy on the eyes, but no laughs and little sexiness.<br /><br />The couple, Mark and Simon, have allegedly been together several years, but neither character is interesting enough to care about, so it's hard to imagine that they care about each other. The fault seems to lie in the script, not the performances; both actors do the best they can with what they're given. <br /><br />The ending is sappy and unaffecting (well, not totally unaffecting; I felt relief that it was over). <br /><br />If you're looking for a movie about gay relationships and AIDS that's funny, \"Parting Glances\" is far better.","finished_norm":["the","box","for","to","die","for","sucker","me","in","a","shirtless","hunki","gui","and","the","promis","of","some","laugh","and","sex","there","be","plenti","of","thoma","arkli","simon","who","easi","on","the","ey","but","no","laugh","and","littl","sexinessbr","br","the","coupl","mark","and","simon","have","allegedli","be","togeth","sever","year","but","neither","charact","be","interest","enough","to","care","about","so","it","hard","to","imagin","that","thei","care","about","each","other","the","fault","seem","to","lie","in","the","script","not","the","perform","both","actor","do","the","well","thei","can","with","what","thei","re","give","br","br","the","end","be","sappi","and","unaffect","good","not","total","unaffect","i","feel","relief","that","it","be","over","br","br","if","you","re","look","for","a","movi","about","gai","relationship","and","aid","that","funni","part","glanc","be","far","well"],"filtered":["box","die","sucker","shirtless","hunki","gui","promis","laugh","sex","plenti","thoma","arkli","simon","easi","ey","laugh","littl","sexinessbr","br","coupl","mark","simon","allegedli","togeth","sever","year","neither","charact","interest","enough","care","hard","imagin","thei","care","fault","seem","lie","script","perform","actor","well","thei","thei","re","give","br","br","end","sappi","unaffect","good","total","unaffect","feel","relief","br","br","re","look","movi","gai","relationship","aid","funni","part","glanc","far","well"],"filtered2":["box","die","sucker","shirtless","hunki","gui","promis","laugh","sex","plenti","thoma","arkli","simon","easi","ey","laugh","littl","sexinessbr","coupl","mark","simon","allegedli","togeth","sever","year","neither","charact","interest","enough","care","hard","imagin","care","fault","seem","lie","script","perform","actor","well","re","give","end","sappi","unaffect","good","total","unaffect","feel","relief","re","look","gai","relationship","aid","funni","part","glanc","far","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,14,16,20,24,30,35,41,43,55,57,60,61,62,68,77,93,101,105,133,171,184,205,253,254,270,281,293,316,340,577,640,650,654,683,717,718,744,888,1298,1754,1946,1951,2065,3019,3302,4204,5515,5598],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,14,16,20,24,30,35,41,43,55,57,60,61,62,68,77,93,101,105,133,171,184,205,253,254,270,281,293,316,340,577,640,650,654,683,717,718,744,888,1298,1754,1946,1951,2065,3019,3302,4204,5515,5598],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,2.330690080046114,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.9536997889255368,1.834162586674748,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,4.012839573363895,1.9463902258768238,2.035389827120098,2.098582041218749,2.1765612129984904,4.642472950759303,2.373087554090762,2.496249838866882,5.143705159219666,2.7073305177318163,2.889652074525771,2.731603554088023,2.832333801361687,2.9012296278682137,2.878207028279898,2.948928684455311,3.604618302480356,3.9998419165363233,3.6621227969605474,3.634471265630037,3.6105180246075443,3.7398317812878634,3.634471265630037,3.700222643192818,3.9323057095458362,4.3521595551061,4.751432692966343,5.014723312293965,4.900964426937307,10.889159747052577,5.408212229355414,5.541743621979936,5.878215858601149,6.2980697041614135,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805355E-4,2.1925531043720598E-4,2.1930944626706033E-4,2.1926535805328188E-4,2.19286108918556E-4,2.1925410152956966E-4,2.193222925991185E-4,2.192214800952665E-4,2.1925535677457442E-4,2.1948193342720784E-4,2.2122346564794953E-4,2.1925571892772593E-4,2.1946336794909405E-4,2.1948623224568857E-4,2.1938652538130765E-4,2.192662217077919E-4,2.1934165776813395E-4,2.194448806979818E-4,2.192775414774106E-4,2.1927673977696296E-4,2.1947401253786462E-4,2.1929870906764107E-4,2.192990409572322E-4,2.194395262708674E-4,2.1927762057634125E-4,2.194888556479086E-4,2.1933249395190825E-4,2.1925481904056077E-4,2.193542198056751E-4,2.194211698754802E-4,2.1929978476330176E-4,2.1941723695242696E-4,2.1952496533805875E-4,2.197287185451422E-4,2.1933211493919242E-4,2.1926608871935255E-4,2.1934514652716485E-4,2.1928835723826443E-4,2.1922171407356012E-4,2.1927747357072436E-4,2.194972270715441E-4,2.1937681902578187E-4,2.1941773696650525E-4,2.192326247137997E-4,2.19277529327431E-4,2.192660062669314E-4,2.1934022582203953E-4,2.1937825969134961E-4,2.1933365036190086E-4,2.192988855908109E-4,2.1926654849491634E-4,2.1971579004444685E-4,2.1932172227464693E-4,2.1927747906929967E-4,2.1932054772559202E-4,2.1925504336804653E-4,0.9826707519874956,2.192892508163027E-4,2.1926685631708617E-4,2.1925491821167637E-4,2.1943032740576226E-4,2.1934224257171348E-4,2.192548265

{"value":"After I watched this movie, I came to IMDb and read some of the reviews, which compared it to Lost In Translation LITE. When I read that I immediately could see the reviewers point.<br /><br />This movie was a poor attempt at a similar theme. Interestingly, the format of the movie is nearly identical, but the PACING is incredibly different. \"10 Items\" rushes the viewer through the 1-day time line of the movie, whereas the better-planned \"Lost In...\" seems to stretch out over a few long days.<br /><br />I'm sure some people will see this because it has Morgan Freeman, and will be disappointed. It seems his better roles now-a-days are supporting roles in big blockbusters, rather than leading roles in sub-$10mil limited release movies and indie

I got passed the fact that Lil Kim was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands weren't moving, I got passed the weaves, I got passed the colored contacts.<br /><br />This is what killed it for me: In the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing. Lisa-Raye and Monica Calhoun stand up and, and then Lil Kim gets up to break up any hostilities by saying, \"Whoa, Whoa, Whoa, Hold up. Let's CHILL OUT here for a HOT SECOND.\" I am a fan of the western movie genre, and I never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of Clint Eastwood's movies.<br /><br />If anyone thinks this movie deserves over a 1 rating, please tell me another movie that's worse than Gang of Roses.<br /><br />I'm

{"value":"Oh my GOD this was so bad! The story was weak - at best - and the animation was flat and lifeless - even childish. This film takes itself far too seriously...unless of course they meant to be funny. I saw this last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival and the entire audience was laughing at every scene. I think my favourite was 'shouldn't you be studying medicine at Oopsalof'! And I also think they were trying to see how many times they could cram in the character Nicalo's only line 'we will be together...it is our destiny.'

{"value":"It's so sad that Romanian audiences are still populated with vulgar and uneducated individuals who relish this kind of cheap and demonstrative shows, as superficial and brutal as the \"Garcea\" series or the \"Vacanta mare\" child-plays...

Pintilie, who 40 years ago made a very good movie (\"Duminicä la ora sase\") followed by another one, nice enough (\"Reconstituirea\"), tries to declare his film-lenghts \"art works\" - but, unfortunately, he masters at a way too limited level the specifically cinematographic means of expression.

merit.","finished_norm":["it","so","sad","that","romanian","audienc","be","still","popul","with","vulgar","and","uneduc","individu","who","relish","thi","kind","of","cheap","and","demonstr","show","a","superfici","and","brutal","a","the","garcea","seri","or","the","vacanta","mare","childplai","the","differ","be","that","mugur","mihäescu","doru","octavian","dumitru","and","other","such","subartisan","never","presum","to","claim","their","show","a","art","pintili","who","year","ago","make","a","veri","good","movi","duminicä","la","o","sase","follow","by","anoth","on","nice","enough","reconstituirea","try","to","declar","hi","filmlenght","art","work","but","unfortun","he","master","at","a","wai","too","limit","level","the","specif","cinematograph","mean","of","express","a","such","niki","ardelean","offer","again","a","sampl","of","how","not","thi","be","about","it","onli","merit"],"filtered":["sad","romanian","audienc","still","popul","vulgar","uneduc","individu","relish","thi","kind","cheap","demonstr","show","superfici","brutal","garcea","seri","vacanta","mare","childplai","differ","mugur","mihäescu","doru","octavian","dumitru","subartisan","never","presum","claim","show","art","pintili","year","ago","make","veri","good","movi","duminicä","la","o","sase","follow","anoth","nice","enough","reconstituirea","try","declar","hi","filmlenght","art","work","unfortun","master","wai","limit","level","specif","cinematograph","mean","express","niki","ardelean","offer","sampl","thi","onli","merit"],"filtered2":["sad","romanian","audienc","still","popul","vulgar","uneduc","individu","relish","kind","cheap","demonstr","show","superfici","brutal","garcea","vacanta","mare","childplai","differ","mugur","mihäescu","doru","octavian","dumitru","subartisan","never","presum","claim","show","art","pintili","year","ago","make","veri","good","duminicä","la","o","sase","follow","anoth","nice","enough","reconstituirea","try","declar","filmlenght","art","work","unfortun","master","wai","limit","level","specif","cinematograph","mean","express","niki","ardelean","offer","sampl","onli","merit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,11,15,28,33,36,42,48,57,64,73,88,93,122,168,204,227,260,262,351,382,445,455,507,610,751,766,846,994,1027,1059,1191,1537,1607,1662,1695,1817,1997,2454,2583,2753,2764,3077,4733,5391,6016,7214,8600],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,11,15,28,33,36,42,48,57,64,73,88,93,122,168,204,227,260,262,351,382,445,455,507,610,751,766,846,994,1027,1059,1191,1537,1607,1662,1695,1817,1997,2454,2583,2753,2764,3077,4733,5391,6016,7214,8600],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,3.0904588387038183,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.6219954307453837,1.6955116224012472,1.834162586674748,1.883428577602134,1.8950689206770979,2.0317223413467334,2.035389827120098,2.2489347673732487,2.4894767118610357,2.624524614047584,2.6005321873043625,2.6754694156628323,2.726701583487816,3.0135689919434205,6.47017040719651,3.241201430615691,3.2787058260741455,3.365138331846453,3.477726550625732,3.8023521382691974,3.9825254665248626,3.9201351739255808,4.140259095366071,4.072271754381138,4.224077767249142,4.3215761317340196,4.613282354485526,4.597282013139085,4.688631791727313,4.715065048795469,4.838444069955973,4.9676558014359795,5.116075806554253,5.290429193699031,5.695894301807195,5.390512652256013,5.482320201509136,6.255510089742618,6.214688095222362,6.437831646536572,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918338E-4,2.3612552253122053E-4,2.3618382374676023E-4,2.3613634324334552E-4,2.3615869074724885E-4,2.3612422060632416E-4,2.36197658517119E-4,2.360890891734517E-4,2.3612557243393584E-4,2.3636958262639025E-4,2.382451064667309E-4,2.3612596245232108E-4,2.3634958866039732E-4,2.3637421220985627E-4,2.3626683357713376E-4,2.3613727335022438E-4,2.3621851370481575E-4,2.3632967894044414E-4,2.3614946409949663E-4,2.361486007136259E-4,2.3636105227822516E-4,2.361722603925211E-4,2.3617261781876985E-4,2.3632391252640506E-4,2.361495492845546E-4,2.3637703746512043E-4,2.362086447949574E-4,2.361249933249295E-4,2.3623204230611872E-4,2.3630414373063932E-4,2.3617341885568197E-4,2.3629990819577738E-4,2.3641592555151682E-4,2.3663535618876822E-4,2.3620823661977844E-4,2.3613713012922476E-4,2.362222709002402E-4,2.3616111205994097E-4,2.3608934115479136E-4,2.361493909678505E-4,2.3638605301314216E-4,2.3625638038324837E-4,2.3630044668255463E-4,2.3610109129494798E-4,2.3614945101465832E-4,2.3613704133264787E-4,2.362169715801616E-4,2.3625793189828033E-4,2.362098901828717E-4,2.3617245049795403E-4,2.3613762528140614E-4,2.3662143292745176E-4,2.3619704431003963E-4,2.3614939688950396E-4,2.3619577938738495E-4,2.3612523491289692E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.36162

worst movies i have ever seen but actually has the honor of being the number one. i have seen quite a lot of films but none beats this one in being stupid. you could say i suffered watching it ... my only excuse is that we were waiting for a few hours and weren't able to go anywhere else without freezing our buttocks off. i do not recommend this to anyone. at first i thought we were watching some really bad porn movie but figured out after 10 minutes that is not the case. it is not a comedy, it is not drama, it is not action, it is not horror, it is just

And I find it hard to believe that a 14 year old girl (mature for her age or no) would be so blase about getting the loss of her virginity \"over with.\" Maybe I am too young to relate (I was four years old in 1976), but I didn't have any problems connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love or Life is Beautiful and I wasn't alive for either of those settings. The cast is very good but unfortunately for them the script did not alow them to engage the audience. Overall, Slums had its moments but unless you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks, I would say skip this one.","finished_norm":["from","the","critic","acclaim","i","expect","much","from","thi","movi","and","from","tamara","jenkin","the","stori","just","meander","along","and","do","not","seem","to","have","a","point","or","a","plot","and","i","find","it","hard","to","believ","that","a","year","old","girl","matur","for","her","ag","or","no","would","be","so","blase","about","get","the","loss","of","her","virgin","over","with","mayb","i","be","too","young","to","relat","i","be","four","year","old","in","but","i","do","not","have","ani","problem","connect","with","the","stori","of","shakespear","in","love","or","life","be","beauti","and","i","be","not","aliv","for","either","of","that","set","the","cast","be","veri","good","but","unfortun","for","them","the","script","do","not","alow","them","to","engag","the","audienc","overal","slum","have","it","moment","but","unless","you","be","yearn","to","reminisc","over","halter","top","and","tube","sock","i","would","sai","skip","thi","on"],"filtered":["critic","acclaim","expect","much","thi","movi","tamara","jenkin","stori","meander","along","seem","point","plot","find","hard","believ","year","old","girl","matur","ag","blase","get","loss","virgin","mayb","young","relat","four","year","old","ani","problem","connect","stori","shakespear","love","life","beauti","aliv","either","set","cast","veri","good","unfortun","script","alow","engag","audienc","overal","slum","moment","unless","yearn","reminisc","halter","top","tube","sock","sai","skip","thi"],"filtered2":["critic","acclaim","expect","tamara","jenkin","stori","meander","along","seem","point","plot","find","hard","believ","year","old","girl","matur","ag","blase","get","loss","virgin","mayb","young","relat","four","year","old","ani","problem","connect","stori","shakespear","love","life","beauti","aliv","either","set","cast","veri","good","unfortun","script","alow","engag","audienc","overal","slum","moment","unless","yearn","reminisc","halter","top","tube","sock","skip"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,15,17,27,32,35,38,54,57,66,67,75,77,84,91,92,109,130,135,163,167,168,171,188,207,227,324,325,364,412,442,460,579,606,767,903,931,943,1048,1599,1760,1845,2421,2480,2937,3338,3431,5159,5507,5765,8061],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,15,17,27,32,35,38,54,57,66,67,75,77,84,91,92,109,130,135,163,167,168,171,188,207,227,324,325,364,412,442,460,579,606,767,903,931,943,1048,1599,1760,1845,2421,2480,2937,3338,3431,5159,5507,5765,8061],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,1.3002700588679295,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.8113893252729412,3.668325173349496,1.929723173391612,3.9141830778533158,1.9742250248702675,1.9463902258768238,2.2212694515902225,2.0105926690411424,2.0489535369135887,2.125691139326857,2.2642139034199635,2.366244071437088,2.4000574358028657,2.4609576687888097,2.4894767118610357,2.373087554090762,2.5378812223426954,2.5531798379045583,2.6005321873043625,2.8753661172782943,2.973659465713028,2.9878441007049847,3.107414446935464,3.257696649984802,3.216957819005698,3.5642670069567886,3.584239140143704,3.79165684915245,3.948766986599908,3.9241755834625858,3.9911462095687695,4.160564361526816,4.662879295624898,4.956227105612356,5.064116067623542,5.102830579804232,5.116075806554253,5.463272006538442,5.583416318380505,5.649374286172302,6.214688095222362,6.543192162194399,6.389041482367141,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.194497759780533E-4,2.1925531043720574E-4,2.1930944626706011E-4,2.1926535805328167E-4,2.1928610891855578E-4,2.1925410152956945E-4,2.1932229259911829E-4,2.1922148009526627E-4,2.192553567745742E-4,2.194819334272076E-4,2.2122345868647684E-4,2.1925571892772572E-4,2.1946336794909384E-4,2.1948623224568836E-4,2.1938652538130743E-4,2.192662217077917E-4,2.1934165776813373E-4,2.1944488069798156E-4,2.192775414774104E-4,2.1927673977696274E-4,2.194740125378644E-4,2.1929870906764085E-4,2.19299040957232E-4,2.1943952627086715E-4,2.1927762057634103E-4,2.1948885564790834E-4,2.1933249395190803E-4,2.1925481904056052E-4,2.1935421980567488E-4,2.1942116987547997E-4,2.1929978476330155E-4,2.1941723695242675E-4,2.1952496533805853E-4,2.19728718545142E-4,2.193321149391922E-4,2.192660887193523E-4,2.1934514652716464E-4,2.1928835723826422E-4,2.192217140735599E-4,2.1927747357072412E-4,2.1949722707154386E-4,2.1937681902578165E-4,2.1941773696650504E-4,2.192326247137995E-4,2.1927752932743077E-4,2.1926600626693117E-4,2.1934022582203932E-4,2.193782596913494E-4,2.1933365036190064E-4,2.1929888559081069E-4,2.1926654849491612E-4,2.197157900444466E-4,2.1932172227464672E-4,2.1927747906929943E-4,2.1932054772559178E-4,2.192550433680463E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630247E-4,2.1926685631708595E-4,2.1

{"value":"this film is terrible. The characters are completely unbelievable, and wildly inconsistent. The plot is awful and some of the classroom scenes are cringe-worthy and make for uncomfortable viewing.<br /><br />In fact the quality of the script and characterisation would suggest that this film was written by high school students, only the utter lack of credibility to the school environment would suggest that, in fact, the writers probably never went to high school. The acting in most cases was weak too, although a lot of this was down to a poor script and plot, i am not sure that any actors could have made this film watchable.<br /><br />having said that the sound track was OK, and the cinematography was nice in places (although the editing was poor).","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","terribl","the","charact","be","complet","unbeliev","and","wildli","inconsist","the","plot","be","aw","and","some","of","the","classroom","scene","be","cringeworthi","and","make","for","uncomfort","viewingbr","br","in","fact","the","qualiti","of","the","script","and","characteris","would","suggest","that","thi","film","be","write","by","high","school","student","onli","the","utter","lack","of","credibl","to","the","school","environ","would","suggest","that","in","fact","the","writer","probabl","never","go","to","high","school","the","act","in","much","case","be","weak","too","although","a","lot","of","thi","be","down","to","a","poor","script","and","plot","i","be","not","sure","that","ani","actor","can","have","make","thi","film","watchablebr","br","have","sai","that","the","sound","track","be","okai","and","the","cinematographi","be","nice","in","place","although","the","edit","be","poor"],"filtered":["thi","film","terribl","charact","complet","unbeliev","wildli","inconsist","plot","aw","classroom","scene","cringeworthi","make","uncomfort","viewingbr","br","fact","qualiti","script","characteris","suggest","thi","film","write","high","school","student","onli","utter","lack","credibl","school","environ","suggest","fact","writer","probabl","never","go","high","school","act","much","case","weak","although","lot","thi","poor","script","plot","sure","ani","actor","make","thi","film","watchablebr","br","sai","sound","track","okai","cinematographi","nice","place","although","edit","poor"],"filtered2":["terribl","charact","complet","unbeliev","wildli","inconsist","plot","aw","classroom","scene","cringeworthi","make","uncomfort","viewingbr","fact","qualiti","script","characteris","suggest","write","high","school","student","onli","utter","lack","credibl","school","environ","suggest","fact","writer","probabl","never","go","high","school","act","case","weak","although","lot","poor","script","plot","sure","ani","actor","make","watchablebr","sound","track","okai","cinematographi","nice","place","although","edit","poor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,10,11,19,21,27,32,41,42,65,72,77,97,103,119,138,146,148,164,166,178,183,191,211,237,262,287,288,296,319,348,379,571,626,629,646,867,1024,1207,2059,2157,2995,3798,4153,6967,8169],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,10,11,19,21,27,32,41,42,65,72,77,97,103,119,138,146,148,164,166,178,183,191,211,237,262,287,288,296,319,348,379,571,626,629,646,867,1024,1207,2059,2157,2995,3798,4153,6967,8169],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,2.742262257014735,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.9073850067444174,1.9209463754160525,3.8927804517536475,4.109111584924517,2.098582041218749,2.1653408989309972,2.2907365189289424,4.652276891959716,2.3018654096236517,2.3930275298746078,2.4423870329693536,2.532833256045391,2.4885128563647294,2.5460113484259455,5.137432284239405,5.280195575021108,2.726701583487816,2.841890188081905,2.8015621426949333,8.851369705900094,2.9056060024680126,3.0103169565570433,3.1272886331425473,3.467417180966871,3.6528204042982337,3.488143311483988,7.180039006118407,3.8844878351953436,4.072271754381138,4.297765483040301,4.956227105612356,5.014723312293965,5.426230734858092,5.7446844659766265,5.850044981634453,6.600350576034347,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612978E-4,2.116930065387443E-4,2.117452751773487E-4,2.117027076039154E-4,2.1172274275403055E-4,2.116918393273703E-4,2.11757678428385E-4,2.1166034303434332E-4,2.1169305127789712E-4,2.11911813107254E-4,2.1359327166514585E-4,2.116934009400755E-4,2.1189388796841974E-4,2.119159636557946E-4,2.1181969576676945E-4,2.117035414702399E-4,2.1177637567609513E-4,2.1187603835847056E-4,2.1171447081128584E-4,2.1171369676217493E-4,2.1190416541618472E-4,2.1173490831315583E-4,2.1173522875559002E-4,2.1187086861014436E-4,2.1171454718202647E-4,2.119184965746197E-4,2.1176752792775866E-4,2.1169253209079127E-4,2.1178850443817637E-4,2.1185314534259396E-4,2.1173594690714967E-4,2.1184934806943345E-4,2.1195336081055466E-4,2.1215008639459363E-4,2.117671619875168E-4,2.1170341306868596E-4,2.117797441048318E-4,2.1172491352726197E-4,2.1166056894252475E-4,2.117144052467595E-4,2.1192657926066675E-4,2.118103241917791E-4,2.118498308375969E-4,2.1167110326541515E-4,2.1171445908036945E-4,2.117033334601196E-4,2.117749931190509E-4,2.1181171516755455E-4,2.1176864445217778E-4,2.1173507874789E-4,2.117038569861958E-4,2.1213760380898701E-4,2.117571277748941E-4,2.1171441055568423E-4,2.1175599373704447E-4,2.1169274868102945E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.117257762850265E-4,2.1170415419131475E-4,2.1169262784140997E-4,2.118619870217944E-4,2.1177694030929714E-4,2.

{"value":"what ever you do do not waste your time on this pointless. movie. A remake that did not need to be retold. Everyone coming out of the theater had the same comments. Worst movie I ever saw. Save your time and money!!!<br /><br />Nicgolas Cage was biking down hills, swimming in murky water and rolling down hills while being attacked by bees but yet his suit was still perfectly pressed and shirt crisp white until the very last scene.<br /><br />Although a good cast with Ellen Bernstein and Cage the acting was just as unbelievable as the movie itself. It is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies. Don't they get a copy of the script first. If you still have any interest at all in seeing the movie at the very least wait for it to come out on

Having read Chris Brookmyre's books religiously since I came across \"Quite Ugly...\", I was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissioned.<br /><br />I obviously had too much faith. <br /><br />Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he doesn't quite fit. How anyone can read the book, and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond me.<br /><br />Entire characters are changed, situations are dropped, and to see Parlablane's dramatic break-in reduced to Nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window... it brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />I dread to think what's going to happen with \"Country Of The Blind\" if this is the benchmark...<br /><br />Please, just avoid

{"value":"I rented this movie about 3 years ago, and it still stands out in my mind as the worst movie ever made. I don't think I ever finished it. It is worse than a home video made by a high school student. I remember them doing a flashback to 1970 something and in the flashback there was a man with a polo shirt, oakley sunglasses and a newer SUV, like a Toyota Rav-4 or something (I don't remember). I don't understand how they could have possibly said that to be in the 70s. He might have had a cell phone too, I cant remember, It was just horrible. I returned it to the video store and asked them why they even carry the movie and if I could get the hour of my life back. To this day it is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty bad ones.","finished_norm":["i","rent","thi","movi","about","year","ago","and","it","still","stand","out","in","my","mind","a","the","wrong","movi","ever","make","i","do","not","think","i","ever","finish","it","it","be","wrong","than","a","home","video","make","by","a","high","school","student","i","rememb","them","do","a","flashback","to","someth","and","in","the","flashback","there","be","a","man","with","a","polo","shirt","oaklei","sunglass","and","a","new","suv","like","a","toyota","rav","or","someth","i","do","not","rememb","i","do","not","understand","how","thei","can","have","possibli","sai","that","to","be","in","the","he","mai","have","have","a","cell","phone","too","i","cant","rememb","it","be","just","horribl","i","return","it","to","the","video","store","and","ask","them","why","thei","even","carri","the","movi","and","if","i","can","get","the","hour","of","my","life","back","to","thi","dai","it","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","and","i","have","see","some","pretti","bad","on"],"filtered":["rent","thi","movi","year","ago","still","stand","mind","wrong","movi","ever","make","think","ever","finish","wrong","home","video","make","high","school","student","rememb","flashback","someth","flashback","man","polo","shirt","oaklei","sunglass","new","suv","like","toyota","rav","someth","rememb","understand","thei","possibli","sai","mai","cell","phone","cant","rememb","horribl","return","video","store","ask","thei","even","carri","movi","get","hour","life","back","thi","dai","wrong","movi","ever","see","see","pretti","bad"],"filtered2":["rent","year","ago","still","stand","mind","wrong","ever","make","think","ever","finish","wrong","home","video","make","high","school","student","rememb","flashback","someth","flashback","man","polo","shirt","oaklei","sunglass","new","suv","like","toyota","rav","someth","rememb","understand","possibli","mai","cell","phone","cant","rememb","horribl","return","video","store","ask","even","carri","get","hour","life","back","dai","wrong","ever","see","see","pretti","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,9,12,25,44,45,46,53,57,63,64,75,78,87,132,174,211,212,230,238,240,290,296,302,306,377,488,558,573,610,621,626,661,793,983,1051,1455,1731,2665,6918,8463],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,9,12,25,44,45,46,53,57,63,64,75,78,87,132,174,211,212,230,238,240,290,296,302,306,377,488,558,573,610,621,626,661,793,983,1051,1455,1731,2665,6918,8463],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,3.838916364248105,4.814188177507422,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,3.400636547121535,1.834162586674748,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,1.9742250248702675,2.0064197866819473,2.115024371522662,2.253494045787767,2.456282578459816,2.5687161421197025,2.5983793339432615,2.7121382192999195,2.597304642813496,5.533214255322713,8.583844132189668,2.9504565686333644,2.902686292364678,2.8739486825973213,3.0602441305135506,3.3933092088131493,3.4572130107926293,3.4623020803001006,3.477726550625732,3.5446859617576822,3.6528204042982337,3.5727776966246974,3.770603439954617,4.165705761027235,8.383633810061841,4.637773374493822,4.8184434032493035,5.463272006538442,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247387E-4,2.1540780663324013E-4,2.1546099248468404E-4,2.154176779332168E-4,2.1543806466120766E-4,2.1540661893957908E-4,2.1547361338862664E-4,2.1537456994793336E-4,2.1540785215747797E-4,2.1563045283100665E-4,2.1734141771275812E-4,2.154082079555468E-4,2.1561221314088646E-4,2.1563467621359296E-4,2.1553671901055078E-4,2.1541852643227173E-4,2.154926387366302E-4,2.155940503050362E-4,2.1542964756197342E-4,2.154288599298077E-4,2.156226709378493E-4,2.1545044370220904E-4,2.1545076976778405E-4,2.1558878983769247E-4,2.1542972527287184E-4,2.156372535802118E-4,2.1548363572753714E-4,2.1540732385964928E-4,2.1550498033487102E-4,2.1557075556130409E-4,2.1545150052150529E-4,2.1556689165339296E-4,2.156727296156061E-4,2.1587290735061655E-4,2.1548326336575651E-4,2.1541839577752056E-4,2.1549606627473277E-4,2.1544027352728276E-4,2.153747998203635E-4,2.154295808469173E-4,2.1564547810166184E-4,2.1552718298266602E-4,2.155673828931977E-4,2.1538551900011013E-4,2.154296356252023E-4,2.1541831477197884E-4,2.154912319184017E-4,2.1552859836735806E-4,2.1548477184478592E-4,2.1545061712774092E-4,2.154188474849184E-4,2.1586020571993635E-4,2.154730530722391E-4,2.154295862490033E-4,2.1547189913423322E-4,2.1540754425062445E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476625E-4,2.1541914990540849E-4,2.154074212905049E-4,2.1557975239475956E-4,2.1549321327804554E-4,2.1540733124454683E-4,2.1538543124717923E-4,2.153637718628817E-4,2.1555849480439082E-4,2.1541788389403327E-4,2.

{"value":"This is one of the worst films ever. I like cheesy movies but this is simply awful. Where are the images in the film that are on the box? I think more money was spent on the DVD box illustrations than on the entire film. <br /><br />Why would a company release a DVD that the cover is so misleading? I feel like such an idiot for renting this movie based strictly on the box. As much as I explore IMDb I should have done a little research and made a list prior to visiting my local video rental store. I have no one to blame except myself. I want my money and time back. <br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. <br /><br />Even if curiosity is motivating you, stick cocktail umbrellas in your eyes instead. It will be much more enjoyable.

{"value":"This reminded me SOO much of Michael Winner's crappy 'Dirty Weekend' with it's awful English low budget feel.<br /><br />Firstly I must say I am a fan of both exploitation and serious film. I appreciate, say, 'Demented' for it's ineptitude and 'Last House on the Left' for it's sheer unashamed brutality. And any number of inventive and increasingly brutal Italian spin offs.<br /><br />This was just pointless though. Kind of like a British budget director thought 'let's remake \"I Spit on your Grave\" without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with Hostel.<br /><br />The whole thing just doesn't hang together or have a point. What's with the rapists's daughter? Why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras?

{"value":"This time we get a psycho toy maker named \"Joe Petto\" (get it?) who makes living, evil toys that kill people. He goes after the family who has the bad luck of just simply living in the same house where he and his mutant robot son \"Pino\" (again, get it?) used to live.<br /><br />Easily the worst (and hopefully [presumably] the last) in this semi - series, this one and the previous one look like soft core porn movies, but without the sex and nudity. It's kind of like a low rent hybrid of \"Halloween III\", \"Puppet Master\", \"Dolls\" and bad home movies. Supposedly in 2000 they started to do a sixth chapter in the series, but it was abandoned and never completed.

{"value":"This is truly terrible: painfully irritating stylised performers screech and mug gratingly incoherent dialogues which take place in scenes which seem to have no purpose, no beginning, middle or end, cut together without any apparent narrative or even cognitive intention, all in the service of some entirely uninteresting and almost undetectable \"story\". What makes it worse is the film's pretentions to \"style\": suddenly a remote-head crane shot spirals downwards, and, without any apparent reason there are sudden whip-pans or wobblyhand-held sections: all this \"style\" merely serves to magnify the almost unbelievably huge misconception of the project and the almost offensive vacuity of the material.

Although it did have a little bit of the 'chill factor' the whole concept of the E.V.O (Electronic Voice Phenomena) did'not seem believable. This movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them. The acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion, like many recent thriller/horror movies.<br /><br />Definitely not a movie I will be buying on DVD and would not recommend anyone rushes out to see it.","finished_norm":["a","a","cinema","fan","white","nois","be","a","utter","disappoint","a","a","filmmak","the","cinematographi","be","pretti","good","nice","light","good","camera","work","reason","direct","but","a","a","film","it","just","seam","a","predict","a","all","the","other","so","call","horror","movi","that","the","market","have","recent","be","flood","with","although","it","do","have","a","littl","bite","of","the","chill","factor","the","whole","concept","of","the","evo","electron","voic","phenomenon","do","not","seem","believ","thi","movi","do","not","explain","the","reason","for","certain","occurr","but","go","ahead","with","them","the","act","be","far","from","mind","blow","the","main","charact","portrai","no","emot","like","mani","recent","thrillerhorror","moviesbr","br","definit","not","a","movi","i","will","be","bui","on","dvd","and","would","not","recommend","anyon","rush","out","to","see","it"],"filtered":["cinema","fan","white","nois","utter","disappoint","filmmak","cinematographi","pretti","good","nice","light","good","camera","work","reason","direct","film","seam","predict","call","horror","movi","market","recent","flood","although","littl","bite","chill","factor","whole","concept","evo","electron","voic","phenomenon","seem","believ","thi","movi","explain","reason","certain","occurr","go","ahead","act","far","mind","blow","main","charact","portrai","emot","like","mani","recent","thrillerhorror","moviesbr","br","definit","movi","bui","dvd","recommend","anyon","rush","see"],"filtered2":["cinema","fan","white","nois","utter","disappoint","filmmak","cinematographi","pretti","good","nice","light","good","camera","work","reason","direct","seam","predict","call","horror","market","recent","flood","although","littl","bite","chill","factor","whole","concept","evo","electron","voic","phenomenon","seem","believ","explain","reason","certain","occurr","go","ahead","act","far","mind","blow","main","charact","portrai","emot","like","mani","recent","thrillerhorror","moviesbr","definit","bui","dvd","recommend","anyon","rush","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,10,14,21,35,48,50,78,83,91,95,101,102,111,140,142,154,158,179,187,231,237,238,247,262,298,323,337,347,353,359,392,395,409,428,469,506,562,629,725,754,774,1024,1243,1322,1364,1501,1572,2245,2543,4006,4027,4806,6648,7481],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,10,14,21,35,48,50,78,83,91,95,101,102,111,140,142,154,158,179,187,231,237,238,247,262,298,323,337,347,353,359,392,395,409,428,469,506,562,629,725,754,774,1024,1243,1322,1364,1501,1572,2245,2543,4006,4027,4806,6648,7481],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,1.463169012899134,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,2.0064197866819473,2.292318797740072,2.0105926690411424,4.064665311355097,2.098582041218749,2.087553710177271,2.1183455303375887,2.317169775997098,2.2844323215331563,2.348499626138016,2.3106972614914807,2.507968722980095,2.4732161909892554,2.7049353070058615,2.640097787510554,2.597304642813496,2.7303758068497004,2.726701583487816,2.7819920465008363,3.0433232530252132,2.973659465713028,3.0151989841543516,3.0266839340212486,3.2189558216683714,3.0670934723591254,3.153168081130368,3.2209578243390444,3.3721070011625462,3.328770687675578,3.449627639403373,6.864298084258826,3.488143311483988,3.7034641371169887,3.7465885637507435,3.753391311073496,4.072271754381138,4.3215761317340196,4.3521595551061,4.436351646326448,4.654440426979034,4.573751515728891,5.0768550934009715,5.156897801074508,5.850044981634453,5.850044981634453,6.101359409915359,6.600350576034347,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.982080342507917E-4,1.9803239209117168E-4,1.9808128781854324E-4,1.980414671436407E-4,1.9806020941939218E-4,1.9803130020030457E-4,1.9809289068399723E-4,1.980018363726982E-4,1.980324339432933E-4,1.982370790049045E-4,1.998100325278663E-4,1.980327610416644E-4,1.9822031058076074E-4,1.9824096171727857E-4,1.9815090602457084E-4,1.980422472003163E-4,1.9811038139259504E-4,1.9820361281159998E-4,1.9805247126764236E-4,1.980517471681573E-4,1.9822992482167856E-4,1.980715899312669E-4,1.9807188969545283E-4,1.9819877666871417E-4,1.9805254271015573E-4,1.982433311860773E-4,1.9810210459216435E-4,1.9803194825949015E-4,1.981217274819502E-4,1.9818219708903856E-4,1.980725615044727E-4,1.981786448550763E-4,1.9827594562220593E-4,1.9845997644414825E-4,1.981017622661582E-4,1.980421270845539E-4,1.9811353245559525E-4,1.9806224011196315E-4,1.980020477029556E-4,1.9805240993401495E-4,1.9825089229392207E-4,1.981421392001805E-4,1.981790964700625E-4,1.9801190224276848E-4,1.980524602937256E-4,1.9804205261315268E-4,1.9810908805237965E-4,

{"value":"The Golden Era of Disney cartoons was dying by the time the end of the 90s. This show Quack Pack shouldn't even be considered a DuckTales spin off because the show barely had anything to do with DuckTales. It's about a teen-aged Huey, Dewey and Louie as they make trouble for their uncle Donald and talk in hip-hop lingo and they are fully dressed unlike in DuckTales. I prefer the little adventurous nephews from DuckTales. There are humans in Duckburg and the ducks are the only animals living in Duckburg. There's no references of Scrooge McDuck. The stories are repetitive, the plot is boring but the animation is good. If you want lots of slapstick humor, I recommend this to you.

{"value":"If I had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease-inducing Dogme 95 style, I would never have rented it. Nevertheless, I took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot. I lasted a very, very, very long forty minutes before giving up. It's just boring, pretentious twaddle.<br /><br />The last French movie I saw was \"Romance\" and it too was pretty dismal, but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time. I am baffled at the continuing popularity of Dogme 95 overseas -- it'll catch on in America about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy. (It's called Dogme 95 because that's the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera.)<br /><br

{"value":"This is a really stupid movie in that typical 80s genre: action comedy. Conceptwise it resembles Rush Hour but completely lacks the action, the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he just cannot act. He is awful when he tries to act tough - he barely manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which, by the way, aren't very funny. And seeing him run (even back then) is not a pleasant sight. In addition, I have a feeling that Pat Morita - at least by today's standards - doesn't give a very politically correct impression of the Japanese. Don't even get me started about the story.

{"value":"The beginning of this movie is excellent with tremendous sound and some nice humor, but once the film changes into animation it quickly loses its appeal.<br /><br />One of the reasons that was so, at least for me, was that the colors in much of the animation are too muted, with too little contrast. It doesn't look good, at least on VHS. Once in a while it breaks out and looks great, but not often Also, the characters come and go too quickly. For example, I would have liked to have seen more of \"Moby Dick.\" When the film starts to drag, however, it picks up again with the entrance of the dragon and then the film finishes strong. <br

It would have been sooner if my wife hadn't gone for a hot-dog!!!<br /><br />Do not waste your money on this film.

{"value":"Hollywood's attempt to turn Jack London's life into a \"Jack London\" adventure film isn't a bad idea; certainly, he led an interesting, and sometimes adventurous, life. This film, however, winds up flat and unsatisfying. Most importantly, it lacks integrity. Michael O'Shea (as London) has some Londonesque speeches; and, it's nice to see his bearded Jack receive \"The Call of the Wild\" after spending some quality time alone, in the snowy mountains, with his dog, \"Buck\". Virginia Mayo and Susan Hayward are both very pretty.

{"value":"Wow, what can I say about this film? It's a lousy piece of crap. I'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did. What's wrong with this film? Here's a better question: What's NOT wrong with this film.<br /><br />The story itself is just crap and cliché. Here's pretty much what it's about...Some kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on, gets killed, and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge. \"All\" of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film. If you haven't seen this movie don't waste your time watching it. Also, the second one isn't much better, so don't bother watching that either...I rated this movie a three because I liked the scarecrow's outfit, not because there was anything good about the movie.

picture.","finished_norm":["wow","what","can","i","sai","about","thi","film","it","a","lousi","piec","of","crap","i","be","surpris","that","it","get","rate","a","high","a","it","do","what","wrong","with","thi","film","here","a","well","question","what","not","wrong","with","thi","filmbr","br","the","stori","itself","be","just","crap","and","cliché","here","pretti","much","what","it","aboutsom","kinda","nerdi","kid","with","no","friend","get","pick","on","get","kill","and","come","back","a","a","scarecrow","for","reveng","all","of","that","be","pack","into","minut","of","worthless","film","if","you","have","not","see","thi","movi","do","not","wast","your","time","watch","it","conjur","the","on","be","not","much","well","so","do","not","bother","watch","that","eitheri","rate","thi","movi","a","three","becaus","i","like","the","scarecrow","outfit","not","becaus","there","be","anyth","good","about","the","movi","i","think","you","get","the","pictur"],"filtered":["wow","sai","thi","film","lousi","piec","crap","surpris","get","rate","high","wrong","thi","film","well","question","wrong","thi","filmbr","br","stori","crap","cliché","pretti","much","aboutsom","kinda","nerdi","kid","friend","get","pick","get","kill","come","back","scarecrow","reveng","pack","minut","worthless","film","see","thi","movi","wast","time","watch","conjur","much","well","bother","watch","eitheri","rate","thi","movi","three","becaus","like","scarecrow","outfit","becaus","anyth","good","movi","think","get","pictur"],"filtered2":["wow","lousi","piec","crap","surpris","get","rate","high","wrong","well","question","wrong","filmbr","stori","crap","cliché","pretti","aboutsom","kinda","nerdi","kid","friend","get","pick","get","kill","come","back","scarecrow","reveng","pack","minut","worthless","see","wast","time","watch","conjur","well","bother","watch","eitheri","rate","three","becaus","like","scarecrow","outfit","becaus","anyth","good","think","get","pictur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,8,12,17,20,22,25,34,39,59,63,76,78,89,104,114,161,202,211,218,224,311,313,326,378,446,496,523,566,871,1003,1116,1397,1507,1713,1890,1943,5704],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,8,12,17,20,22,25,34,39,59,63,76,78,89,104,114,161,202,211,218,224,311,313,326,378,446,496,523,566,871,1003,1116,1397,1507,1713,1890,1943,5704],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,3.1865361882879695,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,2.330690080046114,2.5958480334723544,2.559277576165403,1.3982850089458962,1.5538940054862738,1.8693254449200722,1.8729627573220065,2.1337665533324026,2.0064197866819473,1.9940046109572438,2.0728240170322856,2.4433074195966826,2.4323182980210873,5.194609285626992,2.5687161421197025,2.5940874818617203,2.689504733779216,2.9203338091782562,5.814138121039546,2.942840385588056,3.130944944345658,3.233054746047873,3.293679367864308,3.4986697244709752,3.439602492783994,3.9954846111673676,4.035401218572811,4.224077767249142,4.422928625994308,4.550761997504193,11.999153431210834,4.85885294158718,4.85885294158718,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.318746545765171E-4,2.316691787225997E-4,2.3172637963242863E-4,2.3167979521786174E-4,2.317017209623568E-4,2.3166790136863873E-4,2.3173995330228218E-4,2.3163343296338687E-4,2.316692276835123E-4,2.319086327265584E-4,2.3374876022784924E-4,2.3166961034116844E-4,2.3188901610218275E-4,2.3191317493693827E-4,2.3180782283696826E-4,2.3168070777104295E-4,2.3176041489471834E-4,2.3186948213389037E-4,2.3169266844704964E-4,2.3169182135566603E-4,2.3190026336973306E-4,2.3171503451076985E-4,2.317153851913935E-4,2.318638245480848E-4,2.3169275202442922E-4,2.319159468717961E-4,2.3175073223857316E-4,2.3166865950389985E-4,2.317736881737757E-4,2.318444288443494E-4,2.3171617111051638E-4,2.3184027324578302E-4,2.3195410103209597E-4,2.3216939040434877E-4,2.3175033176679242E-4,2.3168056725302098E-4,2.317641011814397E-4,2.3170409657815978E-4,2.3163368018913944E-4,2.3169259669560062E-4,2.3192479227141042E-4,2.317975669238569E-4,2.3184080156982059E-4,2.3164520857154715E-4,2.3169265560915855E-4,2.316804801322819E-4,2.3175890187423546E-4,2.3179908915749506E-4,2.317519541225618E-4,2.3171522102838577E-4,2.3168105306030677E-4,2.3215572991360748E-4,2.3173935068699467E-4,2.3169260250549605E-4,2.3173810963694036E-4,2.3166889653243196E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908926E-4,2.3168137831085207E-4,2.3166876428991784E-4,2.3185410485865134E-4,2.3176103280889664E-4,2.3166866744629144E-4,2.3164511419405107E-4,2.3162181971902586E-4,2.3183124250942026E-4,2.316800167268866E-4,2.3178532984537479E-4,2.3185335296367434E-4,2.3174816560918507E-4,2.3169290937467284E-4,2.3164541786535974E-4,2.3170467704319538E-4,2.316452930982687E-4,2.316574494686231E-4,2.31645424

{"value":"I had a feeling that after \"Submerged\", this one wouldn't be any better... I was right. He must be looking for champagne money, and not care about the final product... his voice gets repeatedly dubbed over by a stranger that sounds nothing like him; the editing is - well - just a grade above amateurish. It's nothing more than a B or C-grade movie with just enough money to hire a couple talented cameramen and an \"OK\" sound designer.<br /><br />Like the previous poster said, the problems seem to

{"value":"I have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negatively that I could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: Dennis Quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. Danny Glover was cast as the bad guy, but - again - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. Also, Jared Leto was not believable as the former medicine student. The tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early. The finale was, again, neither dramatic nor tense: nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. All we could wait for was the end of the movie.
