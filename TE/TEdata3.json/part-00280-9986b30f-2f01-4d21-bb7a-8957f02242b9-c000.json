{"value":"I just watched it. A couple of laughs, but nothing to write home about. Jason Lee looked like he was having fun. The (long) DVD gag reel consists almost solely of him having fits of uncontrollable laughter. Selma Blair seemed to be punching a time clock, but then again, her character was supposed to be a stick in the mud, so \"well done\" I guess? Jim Brolin was surprisingly funny. (Being married to Babs can't be a picnic.) The soundtrack was hip, and eclectic. Larry Miller, who played Julia Stiles father (hilariously), in 10 Things I Hate About You is funny here as well. He's great, but the best aspect of this movie was the casting of Julia Stiles. I could spend two hours watching her fold laundry, and I feel like I just did.","finished_norm":["i","just","watch","it","a","coupl","of","laugh","but","noth","to","write","home","about","jason","lee","look","like","he","be","have","fun","the","long","dvd","gag","reel","consist","almost","sole","of","him","have","fit","of","uncontrol","laughter","selma","blair","seem","to","be","punch","a","time","clock","but","then","again","her","charact","be","suppos","to","be","a","stick","in","the","mud","so","good","do","i","guess","jim","brolin","be","surprisingli","funni","be","marri","to","bab","ca","not","be","a","picnic","the","soundtrack","be","hip","and","eclect","larri","miller","who","plai","julia","stile","father","hilari","in","thing","i","hate","about","you","be","funni","here","a","good","he","great","but","the","well","aspect","of","thi","movi","be","the","cast","of","julia","stile","i","can","spend","two","hour","watch","her","fold","laundri","and","i","feel","like","i","just","do"],"filtered":["watch","coupl","laugh","noth","write","home","jason","lee","look","like","fun","long","dvd","gag","reel","consist","almost","sole","fit","uncontrol","laughter","selma","blair","seem","punch","time","clock","charact","suppos","stick","mud","good","guess","jim","brolin","surprisingli","funni","marri","bab","ca","picnic","soundtrack","hip","eclect","larri","miller","plai","julia","stile","father","hilari","thing","hate","funni","good","great","well","aspect","thi","movi","cast","julia","stile","spend","two","hour","watch","fold","laundri","feel","like"],"filtered2":["watch","coupl","laugh","noth","write","home","jason","lee","look","like","fun","long","dvd","gag","reel","consist","almost","sole","fit","uncontrol","laughter","selma","blair","seem","punch","time","clock","charact","suppos","stick","mud","good","guess","jim","brolin","surprisingli","funni","marri","bab","ca","picnic","soundtrack","hip","eclect","larri","miller","plai","julia","stile","father","hilari","thing","hate","funni","good","great","well","aspect","cast","julia","stile","spend","two","hour","watch","fold","laundri","feel","like"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,8,10,16,20,29,35,40,43,47,49,51,62,65,81,92,99,131,133,149,174,243,247,253,259,283,302,339,342,416,570,632,645,676,733,796,828,998,1339,1358,1406,1466,1542,1732,1854,2227,2237,2580,2649,2687,2777,5878,6252,6497,7119,7125,7262,8012],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,8,10,16,20,29,35,40,43,47,49,51,62,65,81,92,99,131,133,149,174,243,247,253,259,283,302,339,342,416,570,632,645,676,733,796,828,998,1339,1358,1406,1466,1542,1732,1854,2227,2237,2580,2649,2687,2777,5878,6252,6497,7119,7125,7262,8012],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.357228929984541,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.3195384777338066,1.463169012899134,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,1.7064694353107215,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,4.045224089013853,1.9073850067444174,1.949757232424728,2.0489535369135887,2.056430207256609,2.2512118082053005,2.3212364753796515,2.3253197803590226,2.456282578459816,2.627841366673578,2.7303758068497004,2.7073305177318163,2.7464553122240485,2.7678802023081546,2.902686292364678,3.003844442051426,3.112795625839981,3.1401446412440817,3.944626193933877,3.541919708264792,3.558633189238533,3.6105180246075443,3.7636829971100436,3.850067611308864,3.827761853794566,4.135246553542527,4.506310234933358,4.798834931860927,4.429617614145104,4.499089986959872,4.597282013139085,4.760735085628657,5.0768550934009715,5.129498826886393,5.290429193699031,11.16683263676101,5.339219357868463,5.5623629091826725,5.390512652256013,6.389041482367141,13.321950395701563,6.489124940924123,6.868614562629026,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.551972610560255E-5,5.514534361302007E-5,5.5574046075816035E-5,0.027805374332782396,5.525384390273167E-5,5.5176610070783444E-5,5.5340713040092474E-5,5.515328418216988E-5,5.5277288870768146E-5,6.132713453381191E-5,0.3840818759868551,5.506425462154386E-5,5.609200162785223E-5,0.0985686338740345,5.510440690158911E-5,5.495212209622603E-5,5.632283404245179E-5,5.534589804717511E-5,5.517418761408672E-5,5.521991720581528E-5,5.575420229191415E-5,5.5400731826997885E-5,5.5463813964830054E-5,5.5523570003604955E-5,5.59496848783209E-5,5.565708377744902E-5,5.7996801846534495E-5,5.508062471956069E-5,5.508209825526402E-5,5.5221648439703596E-5,0.0713854097262135,5.534269122499645E-5,0.07035570552456,5.549836204868009E-5,5.5140577502527194E-5,5.539508761674429E-5,5.5085325265916705E-5,5.511787664026328E-5,5.4951846012321555E-5,5.4966103056424595E-5,5.508982507420907E-5,5.567090599677373E-5,5.538801872872837E-5,5.516902998578787E-5,5.583939154837593E-5,5.519020416096618E-

{"value":"This was a classic case of something that should never have been. Gloria was now a single mother, her husband had left her because she wouldn't live in some commune with him (he was mad that Reagan had been elected and wanted to turn his back on society). Right then and there I had problems with the series - come on, I say to myself, is this the same noble Michael Stivic that countered Archie Bunker's right winged philosophies? The series went on, but it just didn't have any pizazz. Whatever momentum Sally Struthers gained from All the Family was long gone. Maybe, if the series had been given another name and presented as being totally independent of All In The Family, it might have worked out.

{"value":"Early film directed by D.W. Griffith; it features a gloriously happy King (Arthur V. Johnson) and his Queen (Marion Leonard) - but, wait! When the King leaves the scene, his Queen makes music with the palace's Minstrel (Henry B. Walthall). When the King discovers the lovers, he decides to enact a horrific Edgar Allen Poe-type revenge. It's difficult to believe the lovers can't hear those plotting against them; although the actors are trying to look alternately noisy (the lovers) and quiet (the cement mixers). The sets make \"The Sealed Room\" look very staged. The performances are okay, and the story is easy to follow. <br /><br />*** The Sealed Room (9/2/09) D.W. Griffith ~ Arthur V. Johnson, Henry B.

{"value":"It is amazing to me what passes for entertainment today. maybe I am a dinosaur from the fifties, and I am out of touch with todays movie going generation, and apparently that is the case with regards to this movie, since so many people loved it. I found it foul and vulgar. I haven't said that about many movies in my life but this one fits the bill. The humor is sophomoric and crude. I am not a politically correct person, and even I found the gay jokes, not only not funny but downright offensive ( I'm not gay). The main character in the movie is not even a likable person, just pathetic. When the movie was finally over i heard a number of people comment on how disappointed they were in what they had just pay good money to see.","finished_norm":["it","be","amaz","to","me","what","pass","for","entertain","todai","mayb","i","be","a","dinosaur","from","the","fifti","and","i","be","out","of","touch","with","todai","movi","go","gener","and","appar","that","be","the","case","with","regard","to","thi","movi","sinc","so","mani","peopl","love","it","i","find","it","foul","and","vulgar","i","have","not","sai","that","about","mani","movi","in","my","life","but","thi","on","fit","the","bill","the","humor","be","sophomor","and","crude","i","be","not","a","polit","correct","person","and","even","i","find","the","gai","joke","not","onli","not","funni","but","downright","offens","i","be","not","gai","the","main","charact","in","the","movi","be","not","even","a","likabl","person","just","pathet","when","the","movi","be","final","over","i","hear","a","numb","of","peopl","comment","on","how","disappoint","thei","be","in","what","thei","have","just","pai","good","monei","to","see"],"filtered":["amaz","pass","entertain","todai","mayb","dinosaur","fifti","touch","todai","movi","go","gener","appar","case","regard","thi","movi","sinc","mani","peopl","love","find","foul","vulgar","sai","mani","movi","life","thi","fit","bill","humor","sophomor","crude","polit","correct","person","even","find","gai","joke","onli","funni","downright","offens","gai","main","charact","movi","even","likabl","person","pathet","movi","final","hear","numb","peopl","comment","disappoint","thei","thei","pai","good","monei","see"],"filtered2":["amaz","pass","entertain","todai","mayb","dinosaur","fifti","touch","todai","go","gener","appar","case","regard","sinc","mani","peopl","love","find","foul","vulgar","mani","life","fit","bill","humor","sophomor","crude","polit","correct","person","even","find","gai","joke","onli","funni","downright","offens","gai","main","charact","even","likabl","person","pathet","final","hear","numb","peopl","comment","disappoint","pai","good","monei","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,6,10,11,23,38,50,54,62,75,126,153,156,162,163,179,187,195,214,216,225,280,288,308,322,369,487,516,575,601,640,676,685,722,745,789,1019,1145,1361,1438,1465,1556,1798,2753,3074,3332,4749],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,6,10,11,23,38,50,54,62,75,126,153,156,162,163,179,187,195,214,216,225,280,288,308,322,369,487,516,575,601,640,676,685,722,745,789,1019,1145,1361,1438,1465,1556,1798,2753,3074,3332,4749],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,2.729695454751562,3.038623282696244,3.43598877114071,1.8113893252729412,2.0226120445069267,1.9742250248702675,2.2391270689902285,4.681980408231769,2.3451551414151686,2.3586007221245198,2.4000574358028657,2.507968722980095,2.4732161909892554,2.51289241584188,2.7303758068497004,2.6070186965339692,2.641219492619754,2.8028805344481915,2.8015621426949333,2.8753661172782943,2.885344817328191,3.121829110937649,3.3220965805878846,3.442099372982581,3.6314455447135003,3.506637894120152,7.9996838330726465,3.6105180246075443,3.607563812710113,3.850067611308864,3.6969916226113715,7.611885612799853,4.091229668125752,4.2574141875167335,5.00274712124725,4.513582994262438,4.484804029712395,4.550761997504193,4.869215728622727,5.390512652256013,5.463272006538442,5.695894301807195,6.032366538428407]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.495540403365735E-5,7.444996222111541E-5,7.502873968568674E-5,7.459522282847491E-5,7.459644498721612E-5,7.449217406434203E-5,7.471372422732888E-5,7.446068252920464E-5,7.462809728766851E-5,0.09916197939603112,0.8949887904085723,7.434048657083536E-5,7.572801488745023E-5,7.680829165999295E-5,7.439469487813032E-5,7.418910003977565E-5,7.603965433731828E-5,7.472072433932614E-5,7.448890358314205E-5,7.455064164031093E-5,7.527196282301137E-5,7.479475366925278E-5,7.487991884315014E-5,7.496059355723833E-5,7.553587760201789E-5,7.514084622713631E-5,7.829962465589829E-5,7.436258731586764E-5,7.436457668922642E-5,7.455297892373572E-5,7.613758503771846E-5,7.471639491141059E-5,8.020172058299719E-5,7.49265611046527E-5,7.444352764798759E-5,7.478713360176173E-5,7.436893337295415E-5,7.441287994090655E-5,7.418872730773861E-5,7.420797528635862E-5,7.437500842001016E-5,7.515950716274964E-5,7.477759012245326E-5,7.44819404343639E-5,7.538697410972547E-5,7.451052701010727E-5,7.69861418178103E-5,7.585403816220634E-5,7.422642002501479E-5,7.439046495252719E-5,7.436466353660818E-5,7.64575647084367E-5,7.439157174082657E-5,7.420138731388682E-5,7.501585373002304E-5,7.441073303487552E-5,8.00205654279184E-5,7.434940892211267E-5,7.422556163904953E-5,7.457996691067406E-5,7.531973750246973E-5,7.457503302164505E-5,7.421182974420584E-5,7.438462062368119E-5,7.418962463352801E-5,7.590621877535631E-5,7.482873342360787E-5,7.466933726552487E-

{"value":"There are two kinds of 1950s musicals. First you have the glossy MGM productions with big names and great music. And then you have the minor league with a less famous cast, less famous music and second rate directors. 'The Girl Can't Help It' belongs to the latter category. Neither Tom Ewell or Edmond O'Brien became famous and Jayne Mansfield was famous for her... well, never mind. Seems like every decade has its share of Bo Dereks or Pamela Andersons. The plot itself is thin as a razorblade and one can't help suspect that it is mostly an attempt to sell records for Fats Domino, Little Richard or others of the 1950s rock acts that appear in the movie. If that music appeals to you this is worth watching.

{"value":"This is a movie about animal cruelty. Under the guise of a marathon race, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death IN SLOW MOTION. The guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial/burning of the horse, which of course is still dead, having been tortured to death. This is one of the sickest, slimiest movies I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. As Gene Hackman and James Coburn near the finish line on their DYING animals, we're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race. I'd like to put the producers and director in a marathon race; I'll decide when they're finished, probably about 20 minutes after they stop

But then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant (yes, milk) going to employ the workers. They keep it afloat until daddy comes home. And the man at the beginning, who appears to be the one that takes the money, is the one. But the ending is dumb. Webcam in the Cayman Islands? Huh?

{"value":"This sequel is a total rehash of the first film. A completely pointless movie. It basically just took every single sceanrio of the first film and they redid it in Omen IV except with a female antichrist this time. It even ends the same way as the first one! The music is too busy and interfering, and because its pretty much a copy of Omen I, it's extremely predictable. It's not a horrible movie, it's not terribly made, there is much worse movies out there, this just had absolutely no point in being made. The Omen remake from 2006 is much worse, even more pointless than this, so I guess it has that. If you someone pointed a gun to your head and you had to choose to watch this sequel or the 2006 reamke, I guess I'd choose this.","finished_norm":["thi","sequel","be","a","total","rehash","of","the","film","a","complet","pointless","movi","it","basic","just","take","everi","singl","sceanrio","of","the","film","and","thei","redo","it","in","omen","iv","except","with","a","femal","antichrist","thi","time","it","even","end","the","same","wai","a","the","on","the","music","be","too","busi","and","interfer","and","becaus","it","pretti","much","a","copi","of","omen","i","it","extrem","predict","it","not","a","horribl","movi","it","not","terribli","make","there","be","much","wrong","movi","out","there","thi","just","have","absolut","no","point","in","be","make","the","omen","remak","from","be","much","wrong","even","much","pointless","than","thi","so","i","guess","it","have","that","if","you","someon","point","a","gun","to","your","head","and","you","have","to","choos","to","watch","thi","sequel","or","the","reamk","i","guess","i","have","choos","thi"],"filtered":["thi","sequel","total","rehash","film","complet","pointless","movi","basic","take","everi","singl","sceanrio","film","thei","redo","omen","iv","except","femal","antichrist","thi","time","even","end","wai","music","busi","interfer","becaus","pretti","much","copi","omen","extrem","predict","horribl","movi","terribli","make","much","wrong","movi","thi","absolut","point","make","omen","remak","much","wrong","even","much","pointless","thi","guess","someon","point","gun","head","choos","watch","thi","sequel","reamk","guess","choos","thi"],"filtered2":["sequel","total","rehash","complet","pointless","basic","take","everi","singl","sceanrio","redo","omen","iv","except","femal","antichrist","time","even","end","wai","music","busi","interfer","becaus","pretti","copi","omen","extrem","predict","horribl","terribli","make","wrong","absolut","point","make","omen","remak","wrong","even","pointless","guess","someon","point","gun","head","choos","watch","sequel","reamk","guess","choos"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,7,8,22,24,25,31,33,66,78,85,103,118,139,184,208,222,230,233,243,286,329,337,387,422,443,483,501,534,584,747,790,1153,2439,2685,3026,4249,5841,6559],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,7,8,22,24,25,31,33,66,78,85,103,118,139,184,208,222,230,233,243,286,329,337,387,422,443,483,501,534,584,747,790,1153,2439,2685,3026,4249,5841,6559],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.852034211452262,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,2.559277576165403,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,3.859446346783224,2.0064197866819473,2.011190219103739,2.098582041218749,2.354379525480895,2.2939035841256437,2.496249838866882,2.6289494000279396,2.5771019354959765,2.7121382192999195,2.6102777977348763,5.255682733347156,2.780700890737216,2.951986790814132,2.973659465713028,6.721038771980316,3.2090054908152035,3.239158528985891,3.613480989738201,3.5119855004467477,6.854421520977661,7.029340131634833,3.7465885637507435,3.749984152751882,4.213208095012239,17.387933281092533,5.243909178064138,5.719991853386255,6.214688095222362,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.296581217598021E-5,8.240635430865404E-5,8.30469851348951E-5,8.256713877005652E-5,8.256849153966505E-5,8.245307728882995E-5,8.26983042934322E-5,8.241822028521525E-5,8.260352648942121E-5,9.1644103491171E-5,0.6205387231385573,8.228517910646448E-5,8.38209911695071E-5,8.501671602703183E-5,8.234518060067818E-5,8.2117614050098E-5,8.416593521187085E-5,8.27060525003115E-5,8.244945729461523E-5,8.251779323544858E-5,8.331620128266035E-5,8.278799326977824E-5,8.288225995958662E-5,8.297155629869228E-5,8.360832036690526E-5,0.05525655694386654,8.666742627034617E-5,8.230964173574302E-5,8.231184371141855E-5,8.252038030198666E-5,8.427433166707527E-5,8.270126039081784E-5,8.877279726344393E-5,8.293388683235415E-5,8.239923207921058E-5,8.277955885338917E-5,8.231666598952545E-5,8.23653090827023E-5,8.211720148456552E-5,8.21385064751735E-5,8.232339027070981E-5,8.31917275998394E-5,8.276899547210905E-5,8.244175000117684E-5,8.344350370914523E-5,8.247339159532814E-5,0.05289632278488029,8.396048242404723E-5,8.215892238437593E-5,8.234049862720833E-5,8.231193984009208E-5,8.462850724124762E-5,8.234172369685273E-5,8.213121445275348E-5,8.30327220701957E-5,8.236293273899732E-5,8.857228224034795E-5,8.229505498038958E-5,8.215797226357163E-5,8.255025246776578E-5,8.336908159374411E-5,8.254479129901144E-5,8.214277285502851E-5,8.233402972085551E-5,8.211819470665355E-5,8.401823952649556E-5,8.282560440607927E-5,8.264917374195869E-5,8.25768933041525E-5,8.287789920658842E-5,8.21151989046754E-5,8.257862449003788E-5,0.22880942152857495,8.226235390227625E-5,8.429830429995238E-5,8.247984720856661E-5,0.03626842801221064,8.261735012169125E-5,8.208945337133585E-5,8.219120888674105E-5]}}
{"value":"Macy, Ullman and Sutherland were as great as usual. Ritter wasn't bad either. What's her name was as pretty as usual. It could have been a good movie. To bad the plot was atrocious. It was completely predictable, trite and boring.<br /><br />From the first 15 minutes, the rest of the movie was laid out like a child's paint by numbers routine. The characters were stock pieces of cut out cardboard. There was nothing new or interesting to say and that completely outweighed the acting, which was a pity.<br /><br />Finally, too bad the script writer wasn't the victim. Especially with the \"precocious\" lines from the child, which were completely unbelievable.<br /><br />Again, it's only the acting that prevented a much lower

{"value":"I found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored. How can people possibly give this a 10? It's not just that it's supposed to be a feel-good redemption film (I think), because it doesn't work on that level either. Weak plot, bad dialogue, terrible acting; there's just nothing there. Harvey Keitel is decent, but has nothing to work with, and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just terrible. The plot progression (especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley) makes no sense. It seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it, without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow. It's only an hour and a half, but that's 90 minutes of your life you'll never get back.","finished_norm":["i","find","thi","on","the","shelf","while","housesit","and","bore","how","can","peopl","possibli","give","thi","a","it","not","just","that","it","suppos","to","be","a","feelgood","redempt","film","i","think","becaus","it","doe","not","work","on","that","level","either","weak","plot","bad","dialogu","terribl","act","there","just","noth","there","harvei","keitel","be","decent","but","have","noth","to","work","with","and","bridget","fonda","and","especi","johnathon","schaech","be","just","terribl","the","plot","progress","especi","the","relationship","between","byron","and","ashlei","make","no","sens","it","seem","like","the","writer","want","the","plot","to","go","a","certain","wai","and","make","it","without","actual","write","in","the","necessari","bit","to","make","it","flow","it","onli","a","hour","and","a","half","but","that","minut","of","your","life","you","will","never","get","back"],"filtered":["find","thi","shelf","housesit","bore","peopl","possibli","give","thi","suppos","feelgood","redempt","film","think","becaus","doe","work","level","either","weak","plot","bad","dialogu","terribl","act","noth","harvei","keitel","decent","noth","work","bridget","fonda","especi","johnathon","schaech","terribl","plot","progress","especi","relationship","byron","ashlei","make","sens","seem","like","writer","want","plot","go","certain","wai","make","without","actual","write","necessari","bit","make","flow","onli","hour","half","minut","life","never","get","back"],"filtered2":["find","shelf","housesit","bore","peopl","possibli","give","suppos","feelgood","redempt","think","becaus","doe","work","level","either","weak","plot","bad","dialogu","terribl","act","noth","harvei","keitel","decent","noth","work","bridget","fonda","especi","johnathon","schaech","terribl","plot","progress","especi","relationship","byron","ashlei","make","sens","seem","like","writer","want","plot","go","certain","wai","make","without","actual","write","necessari","bit","make","flow","onli","hour","half","minut","life","never","get","back"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,9,11,12,18,21,22,23,30,32,33,35,37,38,42,48,49,52,59,63,65,75,108,125,149,166,173,174,206,207,248,267,287,309,379,445,558,577,774,1381,1502,1769,1899,2477,3071,3113,3624,3817,4477,4569,4700,7160],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,9,11,12,18,21,22,23,30,32,33,35,37,38,42,48,49,52,59,63,65,75,108,125,149,166,173,174,206,207,248,267,287,309,379,445,558,577,774,1381,1502,1769,1899,2477,3071,3113,3624,3817,4477,4569,4700,7160],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3364419891718522,4.1133933855221025,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.6219954307453837,3.3910232448024944,3.3840606616174704,1.7122153074726136,1.8693254449200722,1.8729627573220065,1.9073850067444174,1.9742250248702675,2.138507503627933,2.2242236634876535,2.3253197803590226,4.884774065938707,2.4368824319140248,2.456282578459816,2.597304642813496,2.5531798379045583,2.689504733779216,5.417060555847441,2.841890188081905,2.848772527704847,3.1272886331425473,3.241201430615691,3.4572130107926293,3.604618302480356,3.753391311073496,4.449957298382227,4.566029469634981,4.724033718778229,4.828393734102471,5.156897801074508,5.482320201509136,5.521540914662417,6.868614562629026,6.032366538428407,6.2980697041614135,6.868614562629026,6.255510089742618,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.322121776226769E-5,7.272746997317338E-5,7.329285670299797E-5,7.28693697961531E-5,7.287056367873547E-5,7.276870519303365E-5,7.298512951811689E-5,7.273794225363401E-5,7.290148366394509E-5,8.088021658995528E-5,0.67062328061114,7.262052717789179E-5,7.39759533053602E-5,0.2224794791551963,7.267348130873984E-5,7.247264316205724E-5,7.428038258989657E-5,0.10125048222374416,7.276551037847399E-5,7.28258200490903E-5,7.35304525712675E-5,7.306428424336661E-5,7.314747901529926E-5,7.322628721978185E-5,7.378826135441593E-5,7.340236952051769E-5,7.648806569115373E-5,7.264211659476679E-5,7.264405994150465E-5,7.282810325656313E-5,7.437604754203789E-5,7.298773841260879E-5,7.834615426900054E-5,7.319304215021171E-5,7.272118427187842E-5,7.305684047559137E-5,7.264831582794889E-5,7.269124563752608E-5,7.247227905363834E-5,7.249108170639152E-5,7.26542503212538E-5,7.34205987122325E-5,7.304751779651753E-5,7.275870833078218E-5,7.364280292916604E-5,7.278663352062766E-5,7.520497190819639E-5,7.409906087529455E-5,7.250909970313402E-5,7.266934924771372E-5,7.264414477956447E-5,7.468862408606717E-5,7.267043042909258E-5,7.248464615483673E-5,7.328026887990649E-

{"value":"Disappointing and irritating. The screenwriter has no true understanding of human nature but instead strings together clichés in a disjointed fashion. Character is not explored in depth. These are puppets plunked down in a plot he openly confesses needed a dramatic element, the mother's affair with her daughter's lover. <br /><br />Anne Reid gives an excellent performance in spite of being given some peculiar situations and lines, such standing passively to allow her angry daughter to slug her in the eye. The script portrays Darren (Daniel Craig) as a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde without any hints about why, except that he snorts cocaine before the big scene. <br /><br />A mature writer could have done so much more with this

{"value":"Dear Friends and Family,<br /><br />I guess if one teen wants to become biblical with another teen, then that's their eternal damnation - just remember kids, \"birth control\" doesn't mean \"oral sex\", I don't care what the honor student says. On the other hand, even if the senator's aid quotes himself as a \"bit of a romantic guy\", he's still only hitting on a high school girl. If she was my sister, I'd eat this guys kneecaps.<br /><br />Other than that I found out that Mongolians don't kiss the same way the French do and that baseball players named Zoo like delicate undergarments.<br /><br />I think I'd almost rather watch Richie Rich one more time than suffer the indignity of this slip, slap, slop.

{"value":"I really wanted to like this western, being a fan of the genre and a fan of \"Buffalo Bill,\" \"Wild Bill Hickok,\" and \"Calamity Jane,\" all of whom are in this story! Add to the mix Gary Cooper as the lead actor, and it sounded great. <br /><br />The trouble was.....it wasn't. I found myself looking at my watch just 40 minutes into this, being bored to death. Jean Arthur's character was somewhat annoying and James Ellison just did not look like nor act like \"Buffalo Bill.\" Cooper wasn't at his best, either, sounding too wooden. This was several years before he hit his prime as an actor.<br /><br />In a nutshell, his western shot blanks.

{"value":"If you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of non-communication and false ideals, then this is the film for you. If you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest, then you should probably look elsewhere. There are many films that do this far better. For example, try some of the darker films by Bergman. The Filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end. If you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours, like cleaning your house, for example.","finished_norm":["if","you","be","look","for","a","film","the","portrai","the","pointless","and","bore","exist","of","middl","class","live","catch","in","a","web","of","noncommun","and","fals","ideal","then","thi","be","the","film","for","you","if","you","conjur","what","the","film","to","be","engag","and","keep","your","interest","then","you","should","probabl","look","elsewher","there","be","mani","film","that","do","thi","far","well","for","exampl","try","some","of","the","dark","film","by","bergman","the","filmmak","feel","that","in","order","to","show","the","spiritu","poverti","of","the","middl","class","he","should","subject","the","viewer","to","on","agonizingli","dull","and","vacuou","incid","after","anoth","until","the","film","final","come","to","it","tortuou","and","pathet","end","if","you","valu","your","time","there","be","far","well","wai","to","spend","two","hour","like","clean","your","hous","for","exampl"],"filtered":["look","film","portrai","pointless","bore","exist","middl","class","live","catch","web","noncommun","fals","ideal","thi","film","conjur","film","engag","keep","interest","probabl","look","elsewher","mani","film","thi","far","well","exampl","try","dark","film","bergman","filmmak","feel","order","show","spiritu","poverti","middl","class","subject","viewer","agonizingli","dull","vacuou","incid","anoth","film","final","come","tortuou","pathet","end","valu","time","far","well","wai","spend","two","hour","like","clean","hous","exampl"],"filtered2":["look","portrai","pointless","bore","exist","middl","class","live","catch","web","noncommun","fals","ideal","conjur","engag","keep","interest","probabl","look","elsewher","mani","far","well","exampl","try","dark","bergman","filmmak","feel","order","show","spiritu","poverti","middl","class","subject","viewer","agonizingli","dull","vacuou","incid","anoth","final","come","tortuou","pathet","end","valu","time","far","well","wai","spend","two","hour","like","clean","hous","exampl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,8,16,20,24,28,33,34,36,39,43,47,50,60,73,101,108,116,134,148,156,174,213,279,283,307,323,367,368,439,451,469,512,528,534,550,554,601,628,943,1495,1804,2352,2445,2448,2763,2774,3309,3657,4941],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,8,16,20,24,28,33,34,36,39,43,47,50,60,73,101,108,116,134,148,156,174,213,279,283,307,323,367,368,439,451,469,512,528,534,550,554,601,628,943,1495,1804,2352,2445,2448,2763,2774,3309,3657,4941],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9418936859054116,2.393227744058217,2.330690080046114,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.6608112036218214,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,1.838176641236591,1.8950689206770979,4.197164082437498,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,2.2443961816702407,2.3018654096236517,2.3451551414151686,2.456282578459816,2.8432628718938773,2.7910771187233068,2.7678802023081546,5.753571127865041,3.0433232530252132,3.0791938792932125,3.1346146732346205,3.2872346624216657,3.216957819005698,3.328770687675578,3.369778711402955,3.4198487640477615,3.4272107604888307,3.4751392270607813,6.879204985567988,3.506637894120152,7.215127625420226,3.9911462095687695,4.5432147918688095,4.8085911068062925,5.0768550934009715,5.259176650194926,5.408212229355414,5.373120909544144,5.7959777603641776,5.626901430320244,5.822646007446338,6.101359409915359]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.486711137622605E-5,7.43622649417143E-5,7.494036064356195E-5,7.450735444139705E-5,7.450857516051366E-5,7.440442706209757E-5,7.462571625320524E-5,7.437297262196832E-5,7.454019017658668E-5,0.14805086964413028,0.66899620546977,7.425291824672722E-5,7.563881214399749E-5,7.671781641980381E-5,7.430706270011374E-5,7.41017100392894E-5,7.595008450258581E-5,7.463270811951963E-5,7.440116043331462E-5,7.446282576701276E-5,7.5183297279634E-5,7.470665024764475E-5,7.479171510243074E-5,7.487229478688115E-5,7.544690118396145E-5,7.505233513069752E-5,7.820739272111159E-5,7.427499295849966E-5,7.427697998850424E-5,7.446516029726762E-5,7.604789984690334E-5,7.462838379139243E-5,8.010724810123115E-5,7.483830242234143E-5,7.435583794810084E-5,7.469903915610435E-5,7.428133154033803E-5,7.432522634205264E-5,7.410133774630678E-5,7.412056305204276E-5,7.428739943137834E-5,7.507097408492582E-5,7.468950691840226E-5,7.439420548667903E-5,7.529817309043053E-5,7.442275838927007E-5,0.13865322273668454,7.576468697142055E-5,7.413898606398005E-5,7.430283775709161E-5,7.427706673358535E-5,7.636750260209672E-5,7.430394324166538E-5,7.411398283977991E-5,7.492748986672736E-5,7.432308196493918E-5,7.992630633530362E-5,7.426183008804711E-5,7.413812868913841E-5,0.03860874954552598,7.523101568358479E-5,7.448718841686443E-5,7.412441296958592E-5,7.429700031249008E-5,7.4

{"value":"When a small glob of space age silly putty lands on earth it soon begins consuming earthlings and putting on weight. The only part of this senseless drivel that I enjoyed was all the cool classic cars. This dog had so many holes it could be sliced and sold for swiss cheese. This thing actually made 20 million bucks? And McQueen's salary was 3K? All were vastly overpaid. The 'monster' looked a lot like a large beanbag and the 'teens' looked as though they could have children approaching their teen-age years. And those blasts from the shotgun; sounded like a pellet rifle with a sound suppressor.

{"value":"Will they ever make movies without nudity and sex? This came on at 3:00 on Sunday afternoon and I couldn't believe what they showed. Thank God my son was outside or I would have been freaked out if he had seen the soft/medium porn! Do people who make movies not care who they offend or corrupt? Kids could have been watching after church and that is what they show???!!! The acting was good and I enjoyed the suspense but GEE! There was violence and bad guys but that is to be expected in a western movie. Randy Travis was really good in his role. If the writers, directors and producers would just quit putting on so much uncalled for sex scenes. What has to happen to get them to quit going in that direction?

Because the film is very different from the book.<br /><br />What the film seems to be aiming at - taking a rather thought provoking and entertaining piece that combines philosophical ideas with plain funny sarcasm and simplifying it so that everyone would understand it - it achieves with perfection. The film is full of bad and cheap jokes suitable for a sitcoms, and has lost any meaningful message that it could have had.<br /><br />You are better off not seeing

{"value":"OK we all love the daisy dukes, but what is up with this cast. Lets start, Jessica Simpson as Daisy, there is not one thing country about this girl and Daisy was not ditzy! Uncle Jesse was probably the closest one to resemble the original. No offense to Burt, but I never noticed Boss HOg being so tall. That was part of the humor of Boss Hog was his size. Did they even try someone like Danny Devito?!? OK , now get this they cast Jessica Simpson did anyone take a look at her husband? He matches Luke Duke to a tee!!!!!! Cleary these producers did not look at the appearance of the old cast members. The screen t's were never present on the dukes!! This made the movie a turn off from the beginning.

{"value":"this is the first time I'm writing a comment on a movie on IMDb. but i had to write it for this one. its 3 hrs of unadulterated torture. from the starting u get the idea that the movie is gonna be bad. the acting is pathetic. I'm a big fan of Ajay devgan (loved him in bhagat singh) but he is at his worst in this movie. amitabh seems to have worked hard for this one, but somehow the fear is missing. prashant raj is a non actor. and the most irritating part of the movie is nisha kothari. i have no clue why the director took her in this movie. the background score is repetitive. somehow i felt that ramu tried to repeat a sarkar, the color theme, the background score, the camera angles, but it didn't work.

{"value":"Oh my. I decided to go out to the cinemas with some friends, wanting to watch one of those mild, feel-good Christmas movies, and I walk out disgusted. The movie failed. Full-stop. Paul Giamatti who I consider as a good actor played his character and roll just horribly, along with Vince Vaughn who has always been a personal favourite of mine. They try and turn a Christmas movie, into some new-style. Sort of bad, mixed with good, but it all turned out very wrong. The first ten or so minutes weren't too bad, but once we saw Santa, it was over. It didn't get any better, the rate stayed the same, there was NO character development, and certainly is one of the worst Christmas movies ever invented. Don't watch it, whatever you do.","finished_norm":["oh","my","i","decid","to","go","out","to","the","cinema","with","some","friend","want","to","watch","on","of","that","mild","feelgood","christma","movi","and","i","walk","out","disgust","the","movi","fail","fullstop","paul","giamatti","who","i","consid","a","a","good","actor","plai","hi","charact","and","roll","just","horribli","along","with","vinc","vaughn","who","have","alwai","be","a","person","favourit","of","mine","thei","try","and","turn","a","christma","movi","into","some","newstyl","sort","of","bad","mix","with","good","but","it","all","turn","out","veri","wrong","the","ten","or","so","minut","be","not","too","bad","but","onc","we","see","santa","it","be","over","it","do","not","get","ani","well","the","rate","stai","the","same","there","be","no","charact","develop","and","certainli","be","on","of","the","wrong","christma","movi","ever","invent","do","not","watch","it","whatev","you","do"],"filtered":["oh","decid","go","cinema","friend","want","watch","mild","feelgood","christma","movi","walk","disgust","movi","fail","fullstop","paul","giamatti","consid","good","actor","plai","hi","charact","roll","horribli","along","vinc","vaughn","alwai","person","favourit","mine","thei","try","turn","christma","movi","newstyl","sort","bad","mix","good","turn","veri","wrong","ten","minut","bad","onc","see","santa","get","ani","well","rate","stai","charact","develop","certainli","wrong","christma","movi","ever","invent","watch","whatev"],"filtered2":["oh","decid","go","cinema","friend","want","watch","mild","feelgood","christma","walk","disgust","fail","fullstop","paul","giamatti","consid","good","actor","plai","charact","roll","horribli","along","vinc","vaughn","alwai","person","favourit","mine","try","turn","christma","newstyl","sort","bad","mix","good","turn","veri","wrong","ten","minut","bad","onc","see","santa","get","ani","well","rate","stai","charact","develop","certainli","wrong","christma","ever","invent","watch","whatev"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,7,9,10,15,20,25,27,36,37,40,41,44,59,96,153,161,197,202,215,234,236,249,269,294,317,320,324,365,389,409,545,556,748,783,795,840,963,1134,1277,1580,1636,2310,2500,4067,4624,5425,7160],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,7,9,10,15,20,25,27,36,37,40,41,44,59,96,153,161,197,202,215,234,236,249,269,294,317,320,324,365,389,409,545,556,748,783,795,840,963,1134,1277,1580,1636,2310,2500,4067,4624,5425,7160],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,2.1367141713444147,2.247774048205673,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.8693254449200722,4.078141625743051,2.3409902041158843,2.4323182980210873,2.558331832813986,2.597304642813496,2.605934685587711,2.673149229007135,2.617923930016232,2.6754694156628323,2.76533567167316,2.886778509330039,2.8529247828056143,2.938298364153555,2.8753661172782943,3.008694896185175,3.0914425013694116,3.2209578243390444,3.442099372982581,3.4471119148061256,12.738534342749425,3.7568101178222815,3.784589681929357,4.049068857301474,4.035401218572811,5.02684467282631,4.297765483040301,4.605250182788262,4.679973728984199,5.064116067623542,5.156897801074508,5.967828017290836,6.489124940924123,6.794506590475304,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.48398118971969E-5,7.433514954945436E-5,7.491303445498305E-5,7.448018614382687E-5,7.448140641782151E-5,7.437729629587835E-5,7.459850479628591E-5,7.434585332526907E-5,7.451300990582229E-5,8.266811698556668E-5,0.6815282854977944,7.4225842726552E-5,7.561123127266486E-5,7.66898421012811E-5,7.427996743675164E-5,7.407468965554472E-5,7.592239012916836E-5,7.460549411309219E-5,7.437403085823611E-5,7.443567370634007E-5,7.51558825068493E-5,7.467940927902337E-5,7.476444311583397E-5,0.034236427439408884,7.541939029087604E-5,7.502496811183804E-5,7.817887524476895E-5,7.424790938902053E-5,7.42498956944762E-5,7.443800738533382E-5,7.602016980618297E-5,7.460117136178429E-5,8.007803786325854E-5,7.481101344818443E-5,7.432872489937432E-5,7.467180096278486E-5,7.425424565956388E-5,7.429812445551577E-5,7.40743174983147E-5,7.409353579375176E-5,7.426031133801362E-5,7.504360026957412E-5,7.46622722009097E-5,7.436707844764628E-5,7.527071642942909E-5,7.43956209387315E-5,0.2784641215256442,7.573706020119923E-5,7.411195208793784E-5,7.42757440343091E-5,7.424998240792667E-5,7.633965602170288E-5,7.427684911577993E-5,7.408695798089183E-5,7.490016837133744E-5,7.429598086032614E-5,7.989716207578075E-5,7.423475131826573E-5,7.411109502572861E-5,7.446495375287049E-5,7.520358351080234E-5,7.446002747261608E-5,7.409738430746429E-5,7.426990871826833E-5,7.40752134

Every kid who rocks up at university thinking they're gonna be the next Spielberg or Tarantino needs to be handed this film with a handbook titled \"How Not to Make A Film\". Not only is there no story to be had, the film makers weren't even competent enough to make a film worth watching. It's been a while since I saw it, but all I can say is watch the overhead tracking shots in the opening scenes. They are never ending! It's almost like having your teeth pulled, only not as much fun.","finished_norm":["i","have","never","realli","consid","myself","much","of","student","when","it","come","to","watch","film","i","watch","them","form","a","opinion","and","that","it","but","unhing","chang","all","thi","thi","film","be","without","a","doubt","the","much","inept","attempt","at","film","make","i","have","ever","see","everi","kid","who","rock","up","at","univers","think","thei","re","gonna","be","the","next","spielberg","or","tarantino","ne","to","be","hand","thi","film","with","a","handbook","titl","how","not","to","make","a","film","not","onli","be","there","no","stori","to","be","have","the","film","maker","be","not","even","compet","enough","to","make","a","film","worth","watch","it","be","a","while","sinc","i","see","it","but","all","i","can","sai","be","watch","the","overhead","track","shot","in","the","open","scene","thei","be","never","end","it","almost","like","have","your","tooth","pull","onli","not","a","much","fun"],"filtered":["never","realli","consid","much","student","come","watch","film","watch","form","opinion","unhing","chang","thi","thi","film","without","doubt","much","inept","attempt","film","make","ever","see","everi","kid","rock","univers","think","thei","re","gonna","next","spielberg","tarantino","ne","hand","thi","film","handbook","titl","make","film","onli","stori","film","maker","even","compet","enough","make","film","worth","watch","sinc","see","sai","watch","overhead","track","shot","open","scene","thei","never","end","almost","like","tooth","pull","onli","much","fun"],"filtered2":["never","realli","consid","student","come","watch","watch","form","opinion","unhing","chang","without","doubt","inept","attempt","make","ever","see","everi","kid","rock","univers","think","re","gonna","next","spielberg","tarantino","ne","hand","handbook","titl","make","onli","stori","maker","even","compet","enough","make","worth","watch","sinc","see","watch","overhead","track","shot","open","scene","never","end","almost","like","tooth","pull","onli","fun"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,7,11,12,13,17,19,24,34,42,44,68,85,93,110,114,125,131,162,177,219,235,242,259,264,278,297,317,441,538,544,567,582,626,690,762,867,913,1212,1353,1360,1414,3011,3362,4509],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,7,11,12,13,17,19,24,34,42,44,68,85,93,110,114,125,131,162,177,219,235,242,259,264,278,297,317,441,538,544,567,582,626,690,762,867,913,1212,1353,1360,1414,3011,3362,4509],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,3.8437990882891726,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.3210361566119257,1.3982850089458962,3.2439908614907673,1.604729392502474,2.0064197866819473,2.011190219103739,2.035389827120098,2.1290479736304078,2.4433074195966826,2.2242236634876535,2.2512118082053005,2.3586007221245198,2.458149992634611,2.5792094178355414,2.6457189377809835,2.689504733779216,2.7464553122240485,2.757740698455715,2.8336934208777267,2.813490713560207,2.8529247828056143,3.293679367864308,3.43462735814388,3.4222967456864013,3.454678155189441,3.7099788181381825,3.6528204042982337,3.607563812710113,3.749984152751882,3.8844878351953436,4.067587905068712,4.550761997504193,4.436351646326448,4.396611317676934,4.449957298382227,5.7959777603641776,5.695894301807195,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.96616246850728E-5,8.905701538864465E-5,8.974934876305045E-5,8.923077606976571E-5,8.923223801556898E-5,8.910750917883156E-5,8.937252739624684E-5,8.906983901694465E-5,8.927010048486216E-5,0.04238918376978143,0.765271582809021,8.892606065904094E-5,9.058582148306865E-5,9.187804813149329E-5,8.899090461480577E-5,8.874497215041044E-5,9.095860446985083E-5,8.938090092745174E-5,8.910359703051252E-5,8.917744807010102E-5,9.004029218380414E-5,8.946945478265597E-5,8.957132933001743E-5,8.966783239112962E-5,9.035598693816102E-5,8.98834505636315E-5,9.366198007186795E-5,8.895249756151505E-5,8.895487724914067E-5,0.06296197417032702,9.107574913497042E-5,8.937572206749002E-5,9.593726646821594E-5,8.962712278479524E-5,8.90493183548119E-5,8.946033966093439E-5,8.896008871249417E-5,8.901265757971255E-5,8.874452628849503E-5,8.87675507129141E-5,8.896735568138191E-5,0.0594620367313127,8.944892375475685E-5,8.909526771469571E-5,9.017786863952274E-5,8.912946296530343E-5,9.209079241999368E-5,9.073657047453153E-5,8.878961430200582E-5,8.898584477947083E-5,8.895498113594442E-5,9.145850869063781E-5,8.898716871919718E-5,8.875967018284669E-5,8.973393458797765E-5,8.901008945156661E-5,9.572056874329742E-5,8.893673357211302E-5,8.87885875010534E-5,8.921252694692099E-5,9.009744023649319E-5,8.92066250308142E-5,8.877216141386778E-5,8.897885379561473E-5,8.874559966924971E-5,9.07989889033614E-5,8.95101013513878E-5,8.

{"value":"I've seen the movie only recently, although it appeared in 2001. I hoped to see an entertaining movie, but let me tell you, Princess Blade is nothing compared to Azumi. The \"princess\" is not very talkative, as you may have noticed... She reminded me of Jean Claude Van Damme, who only stared to make his point, then beat the crap out of the opponents. During the entire movie, I waited to hear at least a confession about what she liked, why was she fighting, who did she love and trust. I waited in vain. Crappy movie. Crappy dialog. Don't watch it unless you want to be bored out of your minds! It's so bad, that in the end I was wondering how I managed not to scream in frustration 1 and a half hour. Approximately.

Director Alex March takes an interesting tack on this material, shooting it in a quasi-documentary fashion (with macho commentary) and yet giving the tale a touch of Capraesque whimsy; still, by bringing out the cinematic flashiness in this set-up, he turns the main narrative into a jumble. Alda's smug, uncharismatic performance is another handicap, though the supporting cast is filled with real-life pro-athletes (and scintillating Lauren Hutton as Alda's girlfriend--how's that for a fantasy?). *1/2 from

{"value":"I argued with myself whether to rent this or not. I'm always afraid of renting something I've never heard of (don't remember this being in theaters). Great cast...that's what tipped the scales. 30 minutes in, I almost stopped watching it. The first few minutes are fun to watch, but unbelievable. It only gets worse after that. The writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better. Or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable. I give it a 3....a 1 for the writing (only because there are words)and a 2 for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script.

This Steven Bachman (read Steven King) yarn about a man who gets his just desserts from a Gypsy Elder who he just killed, The story itself is there, no doubt about it, but I don't know why I didn't enjoy it more than I could have. I guess what really distracted me was the actors. I mean, who's the lead? Robert John Burke? Who's he? And fer crying out loud, can someone please stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for every Italian Mafioso role there ever is? And while we're at it, does every Mafioso have to have a pasta cooking Italian mother? The only good acting job done here is under 10 pounds of makeup, Michael Constantine as the Gypsy elder. He's pretty good.

{"value":"The show had great episodes, this is not one of them. It's not a terrible episode, it's just hard to follow up \"The man that was death.\", \"All through the house\", and \"Dig that cat, he's real gone.\"<br /><br />This episode is about a couple that has just been married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for her money. The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion. Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggy's family...<br /><br />In my opinion you should watch this episode, but just don't expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season.","finished_norm":["the","show","have","great","episod","thi","be","not","on","of","them","it","not","a","terribl","episod","it","just","hard","to","follow","up","the","man","that","be","death","all","through","the","hous","and","dig","that","cat","he","real","gonebr","br","thi","episod","be","about","a","coupl","that","have","just","be","marri","peggi","ammanda","plummer","and","charl","stephen","shellen","in","the","five","minut","you","find","out","that","charl","onli","marri","peggi","for","her","monei","the","two","go","on","their","honeymoon","and","their","car","break","down","on","a","dirt","road","and","thei","have","to","seek","refug","in","a","old","abandon","mansion","charl","soon","find","out","a","secret","of","peggi","familybr","br","in","my","opinion","you","should","watch","thi","episod","but","just","do","not","expect","the","same","feel","a","the","rest","of","the","episod","in","the","season"],"filtered":["show","great","episod","thi","terribl","episod","hard","follow","man","death","hous","dig","cat","real","gonebr","br","thi","episod","coupl","marri","peggi","ammanda","plummer","charl","stephen","shellen","five","minut","find","charl","onli","marri","peggi","monei","two","go","honeymoon","car","break","dirt","road","thei","seek","refug","old","abandon","mansion","charl","soon","find","secret","peggi","familybr","br","opinion","watch","thi","episod","expect","feel","rest","episod","season"],"filtered2":["show","great","terribl","hard","follow","man","death","hous","dig","cat","real","gonebr","coupl","marri","peggi","ammanda","plummer","charl","stephen","shellen","five","minut","find","charl","onli","marri","peggi","monei","two","go","honeymoon","car","break","dirt","road","seek","refug","old","abandon","mansion","charl","soon","find","secret","peggi","familybr","opinion","watch","expect","feel","rest","season"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,7,11,28,38,43,45,47,51,59,67,80,126,130,166,171,213,226,245,253,260,284,360,449,505,538,733,792,798,817,1080,1223,1238,1347,1487,1800,2115,3847,4640,5255,6901,7172,7176],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,7,11,28,38,43,45,47,51,59,67,80,126,130,166,171,213,226,245,253,260,284,360,449,505,538,733,792,798,817,1080,1223,1238,1347,1487,1800,2115,3847,4640,5255,6901,7172,7176],"values":[0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.5452294193519092,3.038623282696244,1.6608112036218214,1.8162961064622165,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,1.8693254449200722,1.9570915389266579,1.9951803900462557,2.2391270689902285,2.2642139034199635,2.4423870329693536,2.373087554090762,2.8432628718938773,2.5940874818617203,2.7502029743242886,2.7073305177318163,2.6754694156628323,3.110998680163279,3.028335462059722,3.2597778161886266,3.3956930001684253,3.43462735814388,7.527365994220087,4.115443926246347,3.9282323841582003,4.197121957260614,4.229557233013768,13.629644375606428,4.291900363587903,4.566029469634981,4.558366596889411,4.770124825978496,5.116075806554253,5.770002273960917,6.489124940924123,6.214688095222362,6.660975197850782,20.845971810907688,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.106950076081043E-5,7.059026250248733E-5,7.113903448215969E-5,7.072799238305226E-5,7.072915118157662E-5,7.063028596260987E-5,7.084035032928155E-5,7.06004270390371E-5,7.075916253592906E-5,7.850342824312402E-5,0.20791969949761283,7.048646238412128E-5,7.180205725049046E-5,7.28263293746676E-5,7.053786037718408E-5,7.034292416532262E-5,7.209754041684829E-5,7.084698753538202E-5,7.06271850325418E-5,7.068572241163411E-5,7.136964823397641E-5,7.091717897237544E-5,7.099792893922739E-5,7.107442124459463E-5,7.161988091338363E-5,7.124532909874617E-5,7.424034738782545E-5,7.050741736310026E-5,7.050930360163446E-5,7.068793852357798E-5,7.219039410867112E-5,7.08428825574354E-5,7.604383320290277E-5,7.10421531320268E-5,7.058416151609817E-5,7.09099539510533E-5,0.05834049970427887,7.055510267411348E-5,7.034257075678416E-5,7.036082086494933E-5,7.051919452155452E-5,7.126302259789899E-5,7.090090523310267E-5,7.062058287338108E-5,0.12355890749906795,7.064768743899228E-5,7.299495926986015E-5,7.192154711698677E-5,7.037830937541574E-5,7.053384974306442E-5,7.05093859465987E-5,0.1804724031230232,7.053489915228179E-5,7.035457443187846E-5,7.112681657142128E-5,7.055306706985287E-5,0.42437435541963847,7.049492217510054E-5,7.037749549064258E-5,7.071352737581587E-5,7.141494613693466E-5,7.070884927375474E-5,7.036447549663917E-5,7.052830840099947E-5,7.034342156262923E-5,7.197102253738868E-5,7.094939711874025E-5,7.079826451497145E-5,7.073634823289176E-5,7.099419346638147E-5,7.034085532304956E-5,7.073783118729637E-5,7.188515185022676E-5,7.046691004293549E-5,7.221092935090903E-5,7.065321739401749E-5,7.120618490107027E-5,7.077100402362581E-5,7.031880139320456E-5,7.0405966377067

At no time did I ever feel sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their troublesome middle-class care free life, nor did I feel for the emasculated Liev Shrieber. The story line plods along slowly to its predictable, pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning Diane Lane topless. Here's a hint, it occurs about 30 minutes into the film. Fast forward to that part and skip the rest.","finished_norm":["in","what","can","have","be","a","otherwis","run","of","the","mill","mediocr","film","about","infidel","in","the","sixti","the","subtl","freelov","period","the","creator","of","thi","film","pile","on","ridicul","scenario","after","ridicul","scenario","and","top","it","all","off","with","a","trite","littl","cherri","on","top","happili","ever","after","end","at","no","time","do","i","ever","feel","sympathi","for","dian","lane","or","anna","paquin","in","their","troublesom","middleclass","care","free","life","nor","do","i","feel","for","the","emascul","liev","shrieber","the","stori","line","plod","along","slowli","to","it","predict","pathet","conclus","and","the","onli","thing","interest","and","watchabl","about","thi","film","be","the","stun","dian","lane","topless","here","a","hint","it","occur","about","minut","into","the","film","fast","forward","to","that","part","and","skip","the","rest"],"filtered":["otherwis","run","mill","mediocr","film","infidel","sixti","subtl","freelov","period","creator","thi","film","pile","ridicul","scenario","ridicul","scenario","top","trite","littl","cherri","top","happili","ever","end","time","ever","feel","sympathi","dian","lane","anna","paquin","troublesom","middleclass","care","free","life","feel","emascul","liev","shrieber","stori","line","plod","along","slowli","predict","pathet","conclus","onli","thing","interest","watchabl","thi","film","stun","dian","lane","topless","hint","occur","minut","film","fast","forward","part","skip","rest"],"filtered2":["otherwis","run","mill","mediocr","infidel","sixti","subtl","freelov","period","creator","pile","ridicul","scenario","ridicul","scenario","top","trite","littl","cherri","top","happili","ever","end","time","ever","feel","sympathi","dian","lane","anna","paquin","troublesom","middleclass","care","free","life","feel","emascul","liev","shrieber","stori","line","plod","along","slowli","predict","pathet","conclus","onli","thing","interest","watchabl","stun","dian","lane","topless","hint","occur","minut","fast","forward","part","skip","rest"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,11,14,17,24,29,43,44,59,60,61,75,107,137,205,226,274,324,337,364,542,601,627,686,699,743,787,931,957,1131,1178,1253,1300,1374,1555,1569,1675,1753,2006,2080,2137,2283,2333,2440,2756,2845,3327,3451,5714,6560,7812],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,11,14,17,24,29,43,44,59,60,61,75,107,137,205,226,274,324,337,364,542,601,627,686,699,743,787,931,957,1131,1178,1253,1300,1374,1555,1569,1675,1753,2006,2080,2137,2283,2333,2440,2756,2845,3327,3451,5714,6560,7812],"values":[0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,3.321622407243643,3.209458785004948,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,1.9742250248702675,2.1439533986393955,2.2939035841256437,2.571852579609833,2.5940874818617203,5.497904384845272,2.8753661172782943,2.973659465713028,5.9756882014099695,3.4471119148061256,3.506637894120152,3.477726550625732,3.6016814428070463,3.5813614403160887,3.7568101178222815,3.760240652919071,3.9241755834625858,3.969732115064953,4.197121957260614,4.229557233013768,4.315570107673808,4.370968887063596,4.416284083275639,4.589376833631972,9.19456402627817,4.706176101378222,4.715065048795469,4.911775343041523,5.00274712124725,5.541743621979936,10.926544013076883,5.1994574154933035,5.102830579804232,5.322690055917252,10.964640403018272,5.583416318380505,5.672363804397,6.389041482367141,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.03207516205820545,5.822884251266442E-5,5.868151623913737E-5,5.834245381315251E-5,5.834340968857196E-5,5.826185726106835E-5,5.843513618780442E-5,5.823722708550759E-5,5.836816560198308E-5,0.16394794786727643,0.5362593722446648,5.814321936110127E-5,5.9228433717423876E-5,0.04387291437092004,5.818561679011516E-5,5.802481685003708E-5,5.947217332327089E-5,5.844061111897831E-5,5.825929935064027E-5,5.830758595147491E-5,5.8871746043642166E-5,5.849851097634579E-5,5.85651204056925E-5,5.862821775431765E-5,5.907815920551717E-5,5.8769197064646976E-5,6.123974246417998E-5,5.816050480710426E-5,5.816206073681263E-5,5.8309413988781976E-5,5.954876693273198E-5,5.843722498460371E-5,6.272741070307144E-5,0.15386821273107532,5.82238099010402E-5,5.849255116526416E-5,5.816546818851699E-5,5.819983970071027E-5,5.802452532866572E-5,5.8039579567543945E-5,5.817021960742612E-5,5.8783792165148707E-5,5.8485087014348594E-5,5.825385332915821E-5,5.896169873000303E-5,5.827621147639264E-5,6.021244059537634E-5,5.93269991055017E-5,5.805400557597102E-5,5.8182308478540014E-5,5.816212866193125E-5,5.979902959637403E-5,5.8183174120370535E-5,5.80344269791464E-5,5.867143786890612E-5,5.8198160561467734E-5,6.258572554057114E-5,5.81

{"value":"this animated Inspector Gadget movie is pretty lame.the story is very weak,and there is little action.most of the characters are given little to nothing to do.the movie is mildly entertaining at best,but really doesn't go any where and is pointless.it's watchable but only just and is nowhere near the calibre of the animated TV show from the 80's.it's not a movie that bears repeat viewing,at least in my mind.it's only about 74 minutes long including credits,so i guess that's a good thing.unlike in the TV show,the characters are not worth rooting for here.in the show,you wanted Inspector Gadget to save the day,but there,who really cares?anyway,that's just my opinion.for me Inspector Gadget's Last Case is a disappointing

{"value":"The movie seemed to appeal me because of the new type of Pokemon Celebi. But the plot was out of course and didn't have as an interest as the other movies. It was a waste of money and time. The same corny humor and cliche bad guys. The movie was of no use to make if you wanted to make Pokemon famous. The movie should better not associated with animes such as Dragonballz, Digimon, or Yu-Gi-Oh. The drawing and settings are of no level rising to the standards of original anime. It is a shame even to talk about this movie. I bet Pokemon fans will be disappointed with the outcome of the movie and give up on Pokemon. Digimon is more of an anime and doesn't fall anywhere close to Pokemon.It's second movie is coming out late 2002.","finished_norm":["the","movi","seem","to","appeal","me","becaus","of","the","new","typ","of","pokemon","celebi","but","the","plot","be","out","of","cours","and","do","not","have","a","a","interest","a","the","other","movi","it","be","a","wast","of","monei","and","time","the","same","corni","humor","and","clich","bad","gui","the","movi","be","of","no","us","to","make","if","you","want","to","make","pokemon","famou","the","movi","should","well","not","associ","with","anim","such","a","dragonballz","digimon","or","yugioh","the","draw","and","set","be","of","no","level","rise","to","the","standard","of","origin","anim","it","be","a","shame","even","to","talk","about","thi","movi","i","bet","pokemon","fan","will","be","disappoint","with","the","outcom","of","the","movi","and","give","up","on","pokemon","digimon","be","much","of","a","anim","and","doe","not","fall","anywher","close","to","pokemonit","movi","be","come","out","late"],"filtered":["movi","seem","appeal","becaus","new","typ","pokemon","celebi","plot","cours","interest","movi","wast","monei","time","corni","humor","clich","bad","gui","movi","us","make","want","make","pokemon","famou","movi","well","associ","anim","dragonballz","digimon","yugioh","draw","set","level","rise","standard","origin","anim","shame","even","talk","thi","movi","bet","pokemon","fan","disappoint","outcom","movi","give","pokemon","digimon","much","anim","doe","fall","anywher","close","pokemonit","movi","come","late"],"filtered2":["seem","appeal","becaus","new","typ","pokemon","celebi","plot","cours","interest","wast","monei","time","corni","humor","clich","bad","gui","us","make","want","make","pokemon","famou","well","associ","anim","dragonballz","digimon","yugioh","draw","set","level","rise","standard","origin","anim","shame","even","talk","bet","pokemon","fan","disappoint","outcom","give","pokemon","digimon","anim","doe","fall","anywher","close","pokemonit","come","late"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,8,9,18,20,22,30,32,34,35,37,55,56,60,69,87,89,109,126,140,150,170,186,187,199,277,295,369,384,445,574,576,616,689,865,922,1292,1451,1486,1581,1742,3245,5541],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,8,9,18,20,22,30,32,34,35,37,55,56,60,69,87,89,109,126,140,150,170,186,187,199,277,295,369,384,445,574,576,616,689,865,922,1292,1451,1486,1581,1742,3245,5541],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.9536997889255368,1.8610609350701788,1.838176641236591,2.127032521151058,2.115024371522662,1.9940046109572438,2.125691139326857,2.2391270689902285,2.317169775997098,2.332712011146513,2.4071371113909277,2.571852579609833,2.4732161909892554,2.558331832813986,9.349197700029837,2.7910771187233068,3.121829110937649,3.109204957709252,3.241201430615691,3.5039747767006686,3.587125145032839,3.5173618574831282,3.634471265630037,3.9201351739255808,4.030886538218284,4.3336974922663645,4.499089986959872,4.566029469634981,4.671389985292807,4.724033718778229,5.521540914662417,27.79462908121025]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.423064027344053E-5,8.366265337456052E-5,8.431305072809611E-5,8.382588902277217E-5,8.382726241558638E-5,8.371008865461724E-5,8.395905418714491E-5,8.367470024997831E-5,8.386283147918634E-5,9.304123363456462E-5,0.5976149068030848,8.35396308355412E-5,8.509885661802808E-5,8.631281050696904E-5,8.360054706286942E-5,8.336951122102736E-5,8.544905939173418E-5,8.396692051677273E-5,8.370641347296717E-5,8.377579120698937E-5,8.458637112240644E-5,8.405011048738427E-5,8.414581428911619E-5,8.423647196629277E-5,8.48829436124081E-5,8.443902971369264E-5,8.798868611227709E-5,8.356446640181676E-5,8.356670194699075E-5,8.377841771380244E-5,0.07361635128203617,8.396205535074441E-5,9.012615384881417E-5,8.419822822245177E-5,8.365542256550239E-5,8.404154748686452E-5,8.357159774155804E-5,8.362098240706912E-5,8.336909236586228E-5,8.339072215472186E-5,8.35784245355673E-5,8.445999981685032E-5,8.403082306501724E-5,8.369858868051273E-5,8.471561429631089E-5,8.373071265621712E-5,8.65126684472846E-5,8.5240474440771E-5,8.341144930797671E-5,8.359579371190755E-5,8.356679954116246E-5,8.59186834113767E-5,8.35970374579497E-5,8.3383318964164E-5,8.429857022051855E-5,8.361856983559502E-5,8.992258193965243E-5,8.35496572688654E-5,8.34104847024171E-5,8.380874528589434E-5,8.46400576029413E-5,8.380320086068164E-5,8.339505357627265E-5,8.358922618596311E-5,8.337010072979213E-5,8.52991120601948E-5,8.408829501193671E-5,8.390917463195146E-5,8.383579226642064E-5,8.41413870556874E-5,8.336705925629679E-5,8.383754984453304E-5,0.3222734233254043,8.351645765718348E-5,8.558344646936405E-5,8.37372666863914E-5,8.439263652395677E

{"value":"I thought it was not the best re-cap episode I've every seen (though my viewing partner handed me a tissue in anticipation of the Brendan Fraser moment...*sigh*). It was nice to see Cox outside of the incessantly brittle \"Coxism State\" he is in these days, if only for brief moments. I also enjoyed trying to place the episodes included by the length of the character's hair (or height, in case of JD) and the youthfulness of the earliest episodes. I can also see how Zach might be well on the way to a very Chevy Chase/or is that Matthew Perry? prat-fall induced chemical slide (already acknowledged on Conan). A little side note, the song (now stuck in my head) from the janitor-induced dance montage was \"Diner\" by Martin
