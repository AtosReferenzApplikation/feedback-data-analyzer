{"value":"Why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others? Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the Apollo moon-landing with the Titanic sinking and you've got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low-life trash. Is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock and who failed grade school composition do? \"I'll show those old meanies, I'll put out my own movie and prove that you don't have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money!\" Yeah, we already know that. The one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking. The next time I see a slut in a bar who looks like Diane Lane, I'm running the other way. It's child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids. It's audience abuse to simply stick Woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969.","finished_norm":["why","do","peopl","who","do","not","know","what","a","particular","time","in","the","past","be","like","feel","the","ne","to","try","to","defin","that","time","for","other","replac","woodstock","with","the","civil","war","and","the","apollo","moonland","with","the","titan","sink","and","you","have","get","a","realist","a","flick","a","thi","formula","soap","opu","popul","entir","by","lowlif","trash","be","thi","what","kid","who","be","too","young","to","be","allow","to","go","to","woodstock","and","who","fail","grade","school","composit","do","i","will","show","that","old","meani","i","will","put","out","my","own","movi","and","prove","that","you","do","not","have","to","know","nuttin","about","your","topic","to","still","make","monei","ye","we","alreadi","know","that","the","on","thing","watch","thi","film","do","for","me","be","to","give","me","a","littl","insight","into","underclass","think","the","next","time","i","see","a","slut","in","a","bar","who","look","like","dian","lane","i","be","run","the","other","wai","it","child","abus","to","let","parent","that","worthless","rais","kid","it","audienc","abus","to","simpli","stick","woodstock","and","the","moonland","into","a","flick","a","if","that","ipso","facto","mean","the","film","portrai"],"filtered":["peopl","know","particular","time","past","like","feel","ne","try","defin","time","replac","woodstock","civil","war","apollo","moonland","titan","sink","get","realist","flick","thi","formula","soap","opu","popul","entir","lowlif","trash","thi","kid","young","allow","go","woodstock","fail","grade","school","composit","show","old","meani","put","movi","prove","know","nuttin","topic","still","make","monei","ye","alreadi","know","thing","watch","thi","film","give","littl","insight","underclass","think","next","time","see","slut","bar","look","like","dian","lane","run","wai","child","abus","let","parent","worthless","rais","kid","audienc","abus","simpli","stick","woodstock","moonland","flick","ipso","facto","mean","film","portrai"],"filtered2":["peopl","know","particular","time","past","like","feel","ne","try","defin","time","replac","woodstock","civil","war","apollo","moonland","titan","sink","get","realist","flick","formula","soap","opu","popul","entir","lowlif","trash","kid","young","allow","go","woodstock","fail","grade","school","composit","show","old","meani","put","prove","know","nuttin","topic","still","make","monei","ye","alreadi","know","thing","watch","give","littl","insight","underclass","think","next","time","see","slut","bar","look","like","dian","lane","run","wai","child","abus","let","parent","worthless","rais","kid","audienc","abus","simpli","stick","woodstock","moonland","flick","ipso","facto","mean","portrai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,8,12,14,16,23,26,28,29,30,33,36,43,64,67,88,110,114,124,126,135,137,159,168,180,198,201,209,215,257,296,297,314,330,416,440,469,521,540,670,671,832,938,958,1045,1070,1176,1184,1200,1202,1343,1357,1577,1870,1890,1997,2110,2283,2370,2697,2845,4212,4709,5142],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,8,12,14,16,23,26,28,29,30,33,36,43,64,67,88,110,114,124,126,135,137,159,168,180,198,201,209,215,257,296,297,314,330,416,440,469,521,540,670,671,832,938,958,1045,1070,1176,1184,1200,1202,1343,1357,1577,1870,1890,1997,2110,2283,2370,2697,2845,4212,4709,5142],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,2.825681057716235,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.364847727375781,3.9974772509130565,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.6608112036218214,1.883428577602134,1.9570915389266579,2.0317223413467334,2.1290479736304078,4.886614839193365,2.2323930368088845,2.2391270689902285,2.366244071437088,2.2939035841256437,2.300267965194495,2.4894767118610357,2.7097314792693545,2.5439726117360975,2.561435818751577,2.6026896854443837,2.605934685587711,5.520531904645819,2.9504565686333644,2.813490713560207,3.189397019426827,2.9292757465539174,3.1401446412440817,3.212973749990824,3.328770687675578,3.4076979462652486,3.432149042129413,3.7264536553416874,3.6466665387238555,3.7987743169213135,3.952924996748572,4.067587905068712,4.1554492608600455,4.176068548062782,4.358390104856736,8.754636229484511,4.499089986959872,4.315570107673808,4.520909034354511,4.456830177669989,4.613282354485526,4.848596441419991,4.85885294158718,4.9676558014359795,5.051537285416681,5.463272006538442,5.116075806554253,5.626901430320244,5.482320201509136,5.9370563586240825,6.2980697041614135,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.53

{"value":"As an Army veteran, I was deeply offended by this film. In my opinion, it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam war. To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this crap is an understatement. If the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon (it was), it would have been better received. But it was taken seriously my many people, especially overseas. Silly as it sounds, wherever I went in Europe in the late 80's people seemed to judge me and Americans in general by this film. Unrealistic? Hmm, let's see. A monosyllabic, muscle-bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to SE Asia to free some American POW's. In a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M-60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats. And he never misses, running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm.

{"value":"Probably somebody heard of Alberto Tomba. A former policeman, a former sky champion, and, now, a TERRIBLE actor. \"Alex L'Ariete\" was planned to be a TV \"mini serial\", but the Italian television itself refused to show the movie on its channels. Now it's a, believe me, ridiculous movie. The script it's simply hilarious (it's supposed to be a dramatic movie), something like a 5 years old kid work. But what really blows you away it's the amateurish acting: Alberto Tomba, who actually was not believable as a policeman himself, plays terribly a totally silly character: a special operations italian policeman specialized in smashing doors open! (\"ariete\" is \"ram\"). This super-guy will try to save a young nice girl life (an actual italian \"little\" TV showgirl, married to the singer Eros Ramazzotti): nice but absolutely inept in the acting. Lose this one and make yourself a favour.

{"value":"****MINOR SPOILERS*** As a bad movie connoisseur I must have viewed hundreds of bad movies and yet \"Hobgoblins\" stands apart from all others in it's own unique way. Classic baddies such as \"The Creeping Terror,\" \"The Mighty Gorga\" and \"Manos\" are uniformly bad from start to finish. \"Hobgoblins\" on the other hand, starts off bad and gets progressively worse as it goes. During my first viewing of the infamous rake fight scene I thought to myself that this was a truly bad film. I was blissfully unaware that I had just seen the best that this movie had to offer. The movie takes its most massive nosedive into celluloid hell during the painfully inept \"Club Scum\" sequence which is a continuous string of one unfunny joke after another. With just this one film, director Rick Sloane proves that he deserves mention alongside the likes of Coleman Francis and Bill Rebane as one of the worst directors of all time. How bad can a bad movie be?

{"value":"I remember my parents not understanding Saturday Night Live when I was 15. They also did not understand Rock n Roll and many other things. Now that I am approaching their age, I still remember, and find I understand many of the things my kids love. But this is pathetic. I cannot say I have seen any by Sarah except for a few appearances here and there. They were reasonable. I do not see her as anything special. But this show is just so far below what I expected from her. The IMDb write up made it sound like potential. So, just for that, I started watching the first episode. I turned it off half way through. Anything else is better that that. Jokes that are meant for a 5 year old presented on a supposed adult program. Well, Sarah, this adult is inly moved to turn you off. I just cant believe that someone actually financed this insult to comedy.

{"value":"My wife and I both thought this film a watered-down, made-for-TV (BBC) version of Manhattan Murder Mystery...which is itself good, but not great. The story has little inter- character tension or chemistry, and not much of a plot. Woody Allen's character just sort of wanders around running off at the mouth, and Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johannsson don't have a lot more to do. It's pretty disappointing, I must say. Ian McShane's role is just an expanded cameo appearance. <br /><br />The first thing that occurred to me was \"I wonder how much the BBC had to pay Woody Allen to dislodge him from Manhatttan?\" He must've needed the money, and they must have needed his appeal to expand their audience beyond the youth market drawn to the two stars. I'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is unbothersome background noise. If you ever want something to have on while you're knitting or sorting your stamp collection, this'll do the job.

{"value":"This must me one of the worst takes on vampires ever conceived by men. How can one turn such a mesmerizing subject into a totally uninspiring story? Apparantly not such a difficult task... First of all, a conditio sine qua non of any vampirefilm is a dark and gloomy atmosphere with a nice sexy touch, this one lacks all these things.. Too much light - the spots! oh my god, why in the name of Christ/Judas was that about?<br /><br />Every time Dracula came about he was devoured by light (in the script to keep him weak, for the record: just weak) There was only one scene that made it almost worth watching, near the ending of the movie (beatiful dancingscene with Dracula and his new conquest). I really enjoyed the first one, the Judas-twist was defintely original, but this one's just not good, not in any way. Hopefully the third one will cary the vampire-signature I like so much in other classics like Herzog's Nosferatu, Coppola's Dracula or even Interview with the

{"value":"This film is probably the worst film that I have ever seen. I'm studying french at college and thus understood all the dialog, so the language barrier wasn't an issue. I must say it is really hard to empathize with any of the characters depicted in the movie. There is only one professional actor in the cast and I'm guessing no professional directors or writers.<br /><br />Although I have rated it 1 out of 10 it probably doesn't merit such a poor rating. This is merely a futile effort of lowering its current overall rating of 7.3 to something more realistic. Perhaps 4.3 would be a more accurate rating because the film is a true non-event 100 minutes or so in length that you will never get back.<br /><br />The real shame is that I am sure some college student is busting his nut making a film twice as good and half the length.

{"value":"So they hyped the violence and it's been branded as sick. Well, the violence is the best bit I'm afraid, but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their (entirely predictable) rampage. This film has a truly dreadful script. We never get a chance to get to know Robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic. The acting isn't much better, either, the worst of them being the TV chef and the school teacher. The direction is clumsy, the pace enough to send you to sleep. And what on earth is the school film project all about? A comment on the film itself perhaps? The use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable. These guys obviously think they're intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depth. How on earth they got the great Yorgos Arvanitis to light it I'll never know. And how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery.

{"value":"Thomas Archer (Ron Eldard) has his child killed and his wife viciously attacked in a home invasion. Dr. Heller (Christopher Plummer) tries to help him through the post traumatic stress. Then Archer finds himself confronted with a man (Til Schweiger) bound and gagged to a chair. He is told this is the man who killed his child and attacked his wife and he can do whatever he likes to him. And there's a large assortment of instruments there to help him...<br /><br />Film is interesting at first (and shows real restraint in terms of blood and gore) but gets stupider by the minute and has some highly unlikely plot twists and turns. It all ends in a final twist that was so old and stupid that I was shocked anyone would actually think of using it anymore. How such talented actors like Eldard, Schweiger and Plummer got involved in crap like this is beyond me.

{"value":"If you want an undemanding and reasonably amusing hour or so, then it's OK to watch this. It's not all that bad, really. Yeah, it's got more lapses in logic than I care to describe here and might tax the patience of people - like myself, I have to admit - who are inclined to throw things at the TV on occasion, but it's funny at least. Just because it's not always INTENTIONALLY funny, there's no need to let that get you down.<br /><br />However, if you've read the book - or any of the other books by Brookmyre - then you'd probably best avoid it. I've read them all and when I first watched this film, I despised it. I've trashed it in detail and at great length on another site, in fact. The TV plot bears practically no relevance at all to that of the book and served only to outrage and infuriate many faithful (and admittedly rabid) Brookmyre fans.<br /><br />Best bit of advice..?

{"value":"I tend to like character-driven films. I also think Hope Davis turns in consistently good work, so I had high hopes for this movie. Those hopes were soon dashed.<br /><br />The main flaw with this movie is the direction. There are a lot of scenes that are daydream sequences. The movie makes frequent use of the Denis Leary character as the alter ego of the Campbell Scott character. It doesn't work for me at all. This would have worked better as a play than a movie.<br /><br />There are problems with the plot as well. It is important that the characters in a movie take a journey and end up in a place different from where they started. I didn't feel that the characters grew in the experiences portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Finally, the editing wasn't well done, either. There was a very big sag in the middle of the movie that was exceptionally boring.<br /><br />Except for acting, which I felt was consistently strong, this movie failed in almost every aspect of cinema.","finished_norm":["i","tend","to","like","characterdriven","film","i","conjur","think","hope","davi","turn","in","consist","good","work","so","i","have","high","hope","for","thi","movi","that","hope","be","soon","dashedbr","br","the","main","flaw","with","thi","movi","be","the","direct","there","be","a","lot","of","scene","that","be","daydream","sequenc","the","movi","make","frequent","us","of","the","deni","leari","charact","a","the","alter","ego","of","the","campbel","scott","charact","it","doe","not","work","for","me","at","all","thi","would","have","work","well","a","a","plai","than","a","moviebr","br","there","be","problem","with","the","plot","a","good","it","be","import","that","the","charact","in","a","movi","take","a","journei","and","end","up","in","a","place","differ","from","where","thei","start","i","do","not","feel","that","the","charact","grow","in","the","experi","portrai","in","the","moviebr","br","final","the","edit","be","not","good","do","either","there","be","a","veri","big","sag","in","the","middl","of","the","movi","that","be","exception","boringbr","br","except","for","act","which","i","feel","be","consist","strong","thi","movi","fail","in","almost","everi","aspect","of","cinema"],"filtered":["tend","like","characterdriven","film","conjur","think","hope","davi","turn","consist","good","work","high","hope","thi","movi","hope","soon","dashedbr","br","main","flaw","thi","movi","direct","lot","scene","daydream","sequenc","movi","make","frequent","us","deni","leari","charact","alter","ego","campbel","scott","charact","doe","work","thi","work","well","plai","moviebr","br","problem","plot","good","import","charact","movi","take","journei","end","place","differ","thei","start","feel","charact","grow","experi","portrai","moviebr","br","final","edit","good","either","veri","big","sag","middl","movi","exception","boringbr","br","except","act","feel","consist","strong","thi","movi","fail","almost","everi","aspect","cinema"],"filtered2":["tend","like","characterdriven","conjur","think","hope","davi","turn","consist","good","work","high","hope","hope","soon","dashedbr","main","flaw","direct","lot","scene","daydream","sequenc","make","frequent","us","deni","leari","charact","alter","ego","campbel","scott","charact","doe","work","work","well","plai","moviebr","problem","plot","good","import","charact","take","journei","end","place","differ","start","feel","charact","grow","experi","portrai","moviebr","final","edit","good","either","veri","big","sag","middl","exception","boringbr","except","act","feel","consist","strong","fail","almost","everi","aspect","cinema"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,10,12,15,18,19,20,21,24,31,32,39,40,43,48,56,71,72,82,85,96,102,131,156,164,167,179,181,204,207,211,215,233,333,348,349,409,449,465,469,554,561,600,631,645,828,921,930,1709,1762,1771,1956,2509,2627,2664,3047,3836,4062,6868],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,10,12,15,18,19,20,21,24,31,32,39,40,43,48,56,71,72,82,85,96,102,131,156,164,167,179,181,204,207,211,215,233,333,348,349,409,449,465,469,554,561,600,631,645,828,921,930,1709,1762,1771,1956,2509,2627,2664,3047,3836,4062,6868],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,2.0358433949768115,4.495548096411346,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,3.321622407243643,5.086534867203742,1.8610609350701788,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.0390708128715254,2.087553710177271,2.2512118082053005,2.3451551414151686,2.3930275298746078,2.4609576687888097,2.507968722980095,7.332685962348011,2.624524614047584,2.5531798379045583,2.5687161421197025,2.605934685587711,2.6102777977348763,2.948928684455311,3.0103169565570433,3.0568369721919364,3.2209578243390444,3.2597778161886266,6.5362921317182865,3.328770687675578,3.439602492783994,3.4725585804672896,3.558633189238533,3.607563812710113,3.558633189238533,7.655523707589132,3.9911462095687695,4.3095999406873045,4.733083554298147,4.74221603786142,5.102830579804232,4.9909126636002465,5.322690055917252,5.290429193699031,5.3560264761848435,5.408212229355414,5.7446844659766265,6.1754673820690815,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.292863727182814E-5,6.250429475918976E-5,6.299020605002561E-5,6.262624796841144E-5,6.262727402897511E-5,6.253973361520327E-5,6.272573554560249E-5,6.251329496921979E-5,6.26538476451095E-5,6.951102382346615E-5,0.9046869841426401,6.241238472848034E-5,6.357728093931846E-5,6.448422482213705E-5,6.245789518834461E-5,6.228528851408838E-5,6.38389171235692E-5,6.273161247354941E-5,6.2536987890

{"value":"A bunch of kids set up a theatre to have an all-night horror movie marathon. However, as the night goes on, there's somebody among them killing them off one by one. Who is it...and why? I saw this in a theatre way back in 1991. I was looking forward to it--but boy! It did not work at all. The premise is a good one, they have a very appealing young cast and some pros like Dee Wallace Stone on board...but it doesn't work. The story stops making sense halfway through (that could be because of some huge editing before the film was released), the killings are relatively bloodless (how this got an R rating is beyond me) and the unmasking of the killer at the end was boring and stupid.<br /><br />It's really too bad--this movie had potential. With a better script this could have become a great horror film. As it stands though it's mostly forgotten and the cast itself seems embarrassed by it (I heard Stone won't talk about this one).

{"value":"The only reason I don't give this movie fewer than 3 stars is because it isn't quite on par with a movie like Manos: The Hands of Fate. This movie's greatest crime is the fact that it is head-meltingly boring & terribly, unforgivably British. The premise of this movie sounds potentially promising, the whole teleporting concept, but the direction they went with it was completely uninteresting. It was more a movie about research funding and bowties than projecting lasers. The actors were wooden, unemotional, and aloof. As was the love affair between the two scientists-- which was anything but intriguing. I never was able to tell what the attraction was between them as the chemistry was non-existent. Nor did I really understand why the melty-faced main guy decided to slaughter everyone he met.

{"value":"I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow, which I enjoyed. However, this dud seemed to last forever. It's one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of PG-13 while not being kid appropriate. The jokes aren't just low-brow or f**t jokes, they're crude, lewd, and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency. Many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the PG-13 rating...too bad...it might have made a bigger splash as an R-rated film if the funny was left in. (Overstatement? Probably.) I do not recommend this movie. It is a full-on waste of time...and I'm a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot. At 45 minutes in, the movie felt like it should be winding down...and boy were we ready for it to.

{"value":"Please note that I haven't seen the film since I discovered it in 2007, and my town is smaller and doesn't carry it. However, I really want to say something about it. I'm actually doing research for university on the title character Richard Maurice Bucke and would like to point out that the person they based the main character on was in reality completely different!!! Hollywood's ideas of people and artistic license granted, the real Dr. Bucke totally endorsed hysterectomies to cure insanity in women, and would never have practiced anything as liberal as represented in the film. I think it's laughable to see various film critics who write for legitimate newspapers who say this film has some historical basis! The only actual fact I can see is the friendship between Dr. Bucke and Walt Whitman.

{"value":"OK, I really don't have too much to say about this film, other than this: I have seen over 4,000 films in my life, and more than 2,300 of those were horror films. While I have some difficulty deciding which is the best (as opposed to my favourite, which I can tell you is George A. Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD), I can tell you without the slightest hesitation that Todd Sheets' ZOMBIE BLOODBATH is the absolute worst horror film I have ever seen.<br /><br />There is simply nothing positive I can say about this film. The acting, the dialogue, the directing, the make-up, the music... Every aspect of this film is simply so far below what is acceptable that it boggles my mind that this was ever even released.<br /><br />Even if you are a horror or zombie movie completist, please heed my warning and DO NOT waste your time on this garbage.

{"value":"To be as honest as I possibly can, The Devil's Plaything (or Veil of Blood or Vampire Ecstasy or The Curse of the Black Sisters or) is a complete bore. The movie has a good premise behind it  the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the aid and assistance of a group of women dressed in black  but the execution is horrible. There are great, long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens. Characters just stand around with nothing to do. There's no mystery, no suspense, and no plot points to care about. The acting is simply abysmal. Most of the acting involves a group of below average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera. They do this repeatedly. And what little plot there is seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join in the dancing.

{"value":"What a poor image of Professional Police Officers is displayed on the Television in the watching of this alleged Reality show. One can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause that leads to the totality of the circumstances involved to make a \"stop\" , then the \"Pat Down\" of the outside of one's Garment, then to be able to articulate why the officer went into someone's pocket and retrieved contraband, was cut out of the scenes, because if it wasn't, the arrest in most places are going to be tossed, should they even get passed a supervisor. A report of a warrant over the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant unless the person dispatching has the original warrant in hand. If the dispatcher is reading from a computer printout, it is good enough for an arrest, but it does not necessarily mean the warrant is still in effect.

{"value":"I sat down to watch this movie with my friends with very low expectations. My expectations were no where near low enough. I honestly could not tell what genre this movie was from watching it, and if it was a comedy, the humor was completely missed. The plot was nonexistent and the acting was horrendous. My friends and I managed to watch approximately 30 to 40 minutes of this film before we turned it off and promptly begged the video store to take it back. I do NOT recommend this movie to anyone unless you are purposely trying to watch the worst movies of all time. I honestly don't know how this film lasted more than a day in theatres and moreover I can not understand why anyone would willing watch it, considering not only it's very uninteresting title but also the lack of any famous actors/actresses in it's cast. This review is not a joke and I honestly think this could possibly be the worst movie ever made.

{"value":"My girlfriend once brought around The Zombie Chronicles for us to watch as a joke. Little did we realize the joke was on her for paying £1 for it. While watching this film I started to come up with things I would rather be doing than watching The Zombie Chronicles. These included:<br /><br />1) Drinking bleach 2) Rubbing sand in my eyes 3) Writing a letter to Brad Sykes and Garrett Clancy 4) Re-enacting the American civil war 5) Tax returns 6) GCSE Maths 7) Sex with an old lady.<br /><br />Garrett Clancy, aka Sgt. Ben Draper wrote this? The guy couldn't even dig a hole properly. The best ting he did was kick a door down (the best part of the film). This was the worst film I have ever seen, and I've seen White Noise: The Light. Never has a film had so many mistakes in it. My girlfriend left it here, so now I live with the shame of owning this piece of crap.<br /><br />News just in: Owen Wilson watched this film and tried to kill himself.

{"value":"It WAS supposed to be the last Freddy movie (and it was for over 10 years)--you would think they would have tried to get a good movie done. But they turned out giving us the worst of the series (and that's saying a lot). The plot made no sense (I seriously can't remember it), all the main characters were idiots (you REALLY wanted them dead) and Freddy's wisecracks were even worse than usual. The only remotely good bit about this was a brief (and funny) cameo by Johnny Depp (the first \"Nightmare\" movie was his first).<br /><br />Also I originally saw it in a theatre were the last section (reaccounting Freddy's childhood) was in 3-D. Well--the 3-D was lousy--faded colors and the image going in and out of focus. Also the three flying skulls which were supposed to be scary (I think) had the opposite reaction from my audience. EVERYBODY broke down laughing. Looks even worse on TV in 2-D. Pointless and stupid--very dull also.

{"value":"This movie had potential, but what makes it really bad is Lindsay Crouse's acting. I've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some Crouse fans out there that like her in something else, but her performance in this movie is bad.<br /><br />Her delivery is robotic. When she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head. So, her voice has very little inflection. I can't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. She has to know somebody in the biz.<br /><br />Now I hate to be this mean about her, but the comment has to be \"this\" long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else.<br /><br />However, I liked where the story was going so I continued to watch it. The first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. But the end was disappointing as well.

{"value":"Another made for TV piece of junk! This is an insult of a war movie (I use the word movie in it's loosest possible form!) I thought Telly Savalas's career had hit rock bottom when he did the voice over on that visit Birmingham video that's shown on Tarrant on TV on a semi regular basis, but then I'd forgot he was involved in this! I'd tried to push it into my subconscious memory, but cable TV brought the memory kicking and screaming out of me!! <br /><br />I like the bit (laughs sarcastically!) in the film which claims to be a scene from Liverpool in the forties, but it's blatantly a shot of Zagreb Cathedral in the late eighties. Also the steam train the Commando's are training on shows the JZ (Jugoslavia Zeleznice, or Yugoslav state railways) logo's on the side of the locomotive quite clearly, even though the makers have tried to black them out.

{"value":"This movie is maybe one of the most boring movies of 2000 that I have seen! Especially the music fails to create suspense when people suddenly disappear. Also aspects such as martial law are not treated with the necessary seriousness. The story itself has problems: the UN could never take power over the world since the United States alone would not allow it but nations such as China, Russia, Japan, etc. would not either. This would also play against someone trying to take over the world as Nicolae Carpathia does. This reminds me of James Bond movies, only that those have more action! Naturally the movie is made for Christians and only for Christians and they may enjoy it. Since I cannot count myself a Christian I find the whole idea ludicrous. This prophecy furthermore seems to be, if believed to be true, dangerously close to other prophecies by cults for the end of the world.

{"value":"I watched about 30 minutes into this film before I finally got sick of getting bludgeoned over the head with this movie. The soundtrack, the so-called 'plot', and each and every actor.

The bad guy has his bad-guy music going on and says sinister bad-guy-like things, just in case you didn't quite catch on. The good guy does brave and noble things just in case you didn't know he was the good guy. And oh lord, the plane scene. \"MY HUSBAND IS MISSING! OH MY GOD! IT'S IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE GOT UP TO STRETCH HIS LEGS OR GO TO THE TOILET OR ANYTHING, HE MUST BE MISSING!\" (And yes, I know, his clothes were still there, but honestly, she woke up and started to panic

{"value":"A movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself, Blue Juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and Cornwall. Sean Pertwee is the real star of this film, while the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones plays his girlfriend and Ewan Mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal.<br /><br />For those who don't like surfing or Cornwall in the slightest, you'll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting. The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes. Plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional. The plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they're put in.<br /><br />Only Ewan, Sean and Catherine's characters make this a film worth being on videotape, which is why it was only released on videotape in the US after Ewan and Catherine reached mainstream

{"value":"This is one of those movies you think that the makers would refuse to release it because it is so terrible. Obviously they were thinking that children are stupid and are excellent for absorbing endless ads and would think they are entertainment because it is slapstick funny. What is it with the talking car with buttons that say Wendy's, McDonalds, M&M's and Skittles? There was no talking car in the cartoon. (Dr.) Claw is supposed to be evil, not handsome and charming. Why is Rupert Everet 'Claw' anyway? Were the writers on drugs when they wrote these scenes? It looks like they were (badly) lampooning Robo Cop, with the turning a man into a crime fighting android thing. I tried to get my money back but there was a policy where if I watch more than 30 minutes of a movie, you don't get a refund. I'm sorry I watched more than 30 minutes of that pile of crap.

{"value":"This is a formula B science fiction movie, and the director made no bones about it. It is about a dragon who is restored to life by a scientific team. Everything done is stuff you've seen many times before. It is a weak script, with no real characters. In fact, it is full of stereotype characters and situations. The director attacks this by just making it a formula movie, with no attempt to fool us, and that gives this movie a mild appeal, but it isn't something you're likely to remember a while. It is best seen while you're cooking, cleaning, working out. Sort of mindless fun. It has its place in entertainment, but it certainly isn't something you sit down with friends to watch, unless you're all just drunk and don't care. The mass rating of 3.2 is probably fair. I don't think it is as crappy as most people, but I am surprised that some people in the postings thought this was spectacular.

{"value":"To the small minority seen here praising this film GET SERIOUS. I know it's down to peoples personal opinion at the end of the day, but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish. So bad it does not deserve to be part of this franchise. I can only assume those saying how great this is are friends with somebody involved in the film and are trying to give their career a push. Poor in every way, don't con people by saying otherwise. Storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries, script is likewise. Attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead (WOW!) don't disguise the film-makers lack of ideas,and there is sadly a complete lack of any scares. Absolutely no redeeming qualities, utter utter turd. I've awarded this pair of chancers one mark simply for having had the nous to get someone to fund this piece of crap.

{"value":"This film, for an after school special, isn't that bad, and that's the problem. Nothing happens. You feel as if you're still in class. A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players. We never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them. They all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating. Also there are too many characters and no character development. Too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids. This could have had a 'Bad News Bears' feel (the original) since there was a girl on an all boys team, but there wasn't any feel to this movie at all. It has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it, is not fun to bag on, not fun to watch, and is just kind of... there. Plain. Boring.

{"value":"I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing remotely accurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we simply do not walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $100 bills! #2 If I ever let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time I'd be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has very definite standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 Similarly untrue was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them. There is a whole application and vetting process to joining our organization.<br /><br />This film does nothing to dispel the unfortunate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary. In short it does a disservice to our organization.
