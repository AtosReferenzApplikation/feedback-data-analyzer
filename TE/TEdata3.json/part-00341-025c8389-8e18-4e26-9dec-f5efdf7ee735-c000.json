{"value":"Unbelievable!<br /><br />this film gets a 7 out 0f 10. This has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years. not only was the acting incredibly bad, the storyline (if you can call it that) was just as bad. Offcourse everyone knows what's going to happen within the first 5 minutes. Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment. That however, is not the case. There is no action, no suspense, not even a spark between the 2 leading actors.

{"value":"Carnosaur 3: Primal Species (1996) D: Jonathan Winfrey. Scott Valentine, Janet Gunn, Rick Dean, Anthony Peck, Rodger Halston, Terri J. Vaughn, Billy Burnette. Why even bother reviewing this movie? Another stupid dinosaur movie in which top secret military guys discover those lethal (and very fake-looking) prehistoric monsters running around killing people in gory ways. The original was bad enough, the sequel was even worse. This falls somewhere in between, though unrelated to either of the previous CARNOSAUR films. RATING: 2 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and gore, grisly images, and

{"value":"There is something kind of sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something try to do something very different ... and end up being mediocre. I was thinking about Jordan playing baseball, but the same applies to Steve Martin.<br /><br />This movie is reasonably well acted and directed, but the script is a stinker. Martin did a great job adapting a classic story into a comedy in \"Roxanne\", but this effort to bring a Victorian drama to the contemporary scene smacks straight into a wall of implausibility.

{"value":"note to George Litman, and others: the Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff is \"I don't think so, *breeder*\".<br /><br />my favorite riff is \"Why were you looking at his 'like'?\", simply for the complete absurdity. that, and \"Right well did not!\" over all, I would say we must give credit to the MST3K crew for trying to ridicule this TV movie. you really can't make much fun of the dialog; Bill S was a good playwright. on the other hand, this production is so bad that even he would disown it. a junior high school drama club could do better.<br /><br />I would recommend that you

{"value":"I heard many stories about this film being great... Well, I took my chance when I saw it for a cheap price at Ebay last month.<br /><br />I watched it, and I have only a few comments about it:<br /><br />1) Terrible story-line, 2) Terrible acting, 3) Bad fighting-scenes...<br /><br />I never seen any worse movie in my life so far!! When the storyline is bad, than at least make the fights something more interesting. But BOTH are done ridiculously bad...<br /><br />* The only positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick.

{"value":"That's a problem I have with movies that come on television, when there is nothing else to watch. I somehow get sucked into really bad movies.<br /><br />But this one was fairly watchable. The concept of being the only ones left on Earth after a comet, then finding out zombies are around makes me laugh. And that's why I gave this movie a 2, instead of 1. The story was stupid...but in that way that makes you laugh (too stupid >funny).<br /><br />I think I only watched it because the guy from Star Trek was the lead.

{"value":"Not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviews.<br /><br />While watching \"Bang\" one night on TV, I found myself bored by the nonsensical, random plot which was occurring on screen. The entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless, artsy-fartsy self-indulgence on the part of the filmmaker. The fact that the director/writer goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness. <br /><br />Those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare I say, more entertaining than this complete waste of time.","finished_norm":["not","sure","why","thi","movi","seem","to","have","get","such","rave","reviewsbr","br","while","watch","bang","on","night","on","tv","i","find","myself","bore","by","the","nonsens","random","plot","which","be","occur","on","screen","the","entir","movi","seem","to","be","noth","much","than","a","exercis","in","meaningless","artsyfartsi","selfindulg","on","the","part","of","the","filmmak","the","fact","that","the","directorwrit","go","by","a","on","name","monik","onli","reinforc","thi","sens","of","pretenti","br","br","that","interest","in","indi","flick","would","be","well","off","look","for","someth","well","write","and","dare","i","sai","much","entertain","than","thi","complet","wast","of","time"],"filtered":["sure","thi","movi","seem","get","rave","reviewsbr","br","watch","bang","night","tv","find","bore","nonsens","random","plot","occur","screen","entir","movi","seem","noth","much","exercis","meaningless","artsyfartsi","selfindulg","part","filmmak","fact","directorwrit","go","name","monik","onli","reinforc","thi","sens","pretenti","br","br","interest","indi","flick","well","look","someth","well","write","dare","sai","much","entertain","thi","complet","wast","time"],"filtered2":["sure","seem","get","rave","reviewsbr","watch","bang","night","tv","find","bore","nonsens","random","plot","occur","screen","entir","seem","noth","exercis","meaningless","artsyfartsi","selfindulg","part","filmmak","fact","directorwrit","go","name","monik","onli","reinforc","sens","pretenti","interest","indi","flick","well","look","someth","well","write","dare","entertain","complet","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,8,11,16,20,32,35,38,49,53,60,61,65,89,97,103,108,119,143,172,173,192,195,198,210,257,323,859,905,1047,1259,1741,2074,2082,2154,2249,2430,3068,5054,5128],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,8,11,16,20,32,35,38,49,53,60,61,65,89,97,103,108,119,143,172,173,192,195,198,210,257,323,859,905,1047,1259,1741,2074,2082,2154,2249,2430,3068,5054,5128],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,2.330690080046114,1.3711311285073675,2.926338025798268,1.519311641348122,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,1.9940046109572438,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.138507503627933,2.1653408989309972,2.3409902041158843,2.5001408943598484,2.4368824319140248,2.5318267134339894,2.51289241584188,2.5439726117360975,2.687151791517189,2.7602659523229094,3.0433232530252132,3.9405024767500145,3.9121030022283168,4.140259095366071,4.315570107673808,4.751432692966343,5.064116067623542,4.944927550358424,5.185068678041204,5.0768550934009715,5.243909178064138,5.501738287366237,6.137727054086234,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.731092965484181E-4,2.7286728059361897E-4,2.7293465363304766E-4,2.7287978503727245E-4,2.729056098721009E-4,2.72865776085753E-4,2.7295064113039643E-4,2.728251781086749E-4,2.7286733826132925E-4,2.731493170874147E-4,2.75316679772713E-4,2.7286778896761047E-4,2.7312621200724255E-4,2.7315466704635647E-4,2.7303058001336335E-4,2.7288085987125046E-4,2.729747414406555E-4,2.7310320428201753E-4,2.728949475334678E-4,2.728939498024639E-4,2.731394593944327E-4,2.729212909901959E-4,2.729217040329177E-4,2.73096540598648E-4,2.728950459735469E-4,2.731579319188389E-4,2.729633369022277E-4,2.728666690414244E-4,2.7299037512823064E-4,2.7307369572578805E-4,2.7292262971329956E-4,2.7306880113045907E-4,2.7320287109470066E-4,2.734564457215511E-4,2.7296286521390754E-4,2.7288069436468313E-4,2.729790832656608E-4,2.729084079474749E-4,2.7282546929897986E-4,2.728948630223434E-4,2.7316835031006314E-4,2.730185002747631E-4,2.730694234072082E-4,2.7283904779213373E-4,2.7289493241259395E-4,2.7288059175112323E-4,2.729729593573118E-4,2.7302029320965226E-4,2.729647760758072E-4,2.729215106765388E-4,2.7288126656385827E-4,2.7344035596381676E-4,2.729499313510652E-4,2.728948698654219E-4,2.729484696030879E-4,2.728669482211208E-4,0.9784334310120351,2.7290952002183614E-4,2.7288164965423003E-4,2.7286679246170815E-4,2.730850924412429E-4,2.729754692395038E-4,2.728666783962242E-4,2.7283893663133604E-4,2.728114996624305E-4,2.73058164443755E-4,2.728800459376027E-4,2.7300408705697456E-4,2.730842068355754E-4,2.7296031384501626E-4,2.728952313056369E-4,2.7283929430500087E-4,2.729090916375394E-4,2.728391473503778E-4,2.7285346550758277E-4,2.72839302027033E-4,2.7301641286068504E-4,2.729351544391077E-4,2.7286704260300477E-4,2.7289347489153437E-4]}}
{"value":"This is the movie that epitomizes the D&D fear of the 80s (and even today). The fear being that people who play D&D (or any other role-playing game for that matter) will be \"sucked in\" and lose their ability to distinguish reality from fantasy (and go on killing sprees, child sacrifices, suicide, etc). Great movie for anyone who likes to blame the problems of society on inanimate objects, but anyone who has played a role-playing game, a video game, or even acted in a play will see this as an insult to their intelligence. It is to D&D what Wargames was to computers. Plus as a movie, it just kinda sucks.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","movi","that","epitom","the","dd","fear","of","the","and","even","todai","the","fear","be","that","peopl","who","plai","dd","or","ani","other","roleplai","game","for","that","matt","will","be","suck","in","and","lose","their","abil","to","distinguish","realiti","from","fantasi","and","go","on","kill","spree","child","sacrific","suicid","etc","great","movi","for","anyon","who","like","to","blame","the","problem","of","societi","on","inanim","object","but","anyon","who","have","plai","a","roleplai","game","a","video","game","or","even","act","in","a","plai","will","see","thi","a","a","insult","to","their","intellig","it","be","to","dd","what","wargam","be","to","comput","plu","a","a","movi","it","just","kinda","suck"],"filtered":["thi","movi","epitom","dd","fear","even","todai","fear","peopl","plai","dd","ani","roleplai","game","matt","suck","lose","abil","distinguish","realiti","fantasi","go","kill","spree","child","sacrific","suicid","etc","great","movi","anyon","like","blame","problem","societi","inanim","object","anyon","plai","roleplai","game","video","game","even","act","plai","see","thi","insult","intellig","dd","wargam","comput","plu","movi","kinda","suck"],"filtered2":["epitom","dd","fear","even","todai","fear","peopl","plai","dd","ani","roleplai","game","matt","suck","lose","abil","distinguish","realiti","fantasi","go","kill","spree","child","sacrific","suicid","etc","great","anyon","like","blame","problem","societi","inanim","object","anyon","plai","roleplai","game","video","game","even","act","plai","see","insult","intellig","dd","wargam","comput","plu","kinda","suck"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,21,23,27,40,51,76,158,167,180,221,240,374,408,421,429,603,656,709,749,765,789,812,847,898,996,1049,1261,1373,1397,1986,3719,3857,6078,6089,6753],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,21,23,27,40,51,76,158,167,180,221,240,374,408,421,429,603,656,709,749,765,789,812,847,898,996,1049,1261,1373,1397,1986,3719,3857,6078,6089,6753],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3002700588679295,4.885490627496221,1.7139899308309823,2.1337665533324026,4.621394522982961,2.4609576687888097,2.7097314792693545,2.6423424573643777,2.7666071276613566,10.371639032377889,3.130944944345658,6.519555632377253,3.2872346624216657,3.530930586689197,3.68099128126493,3.6497387377608255,3.7165362186843414,3.965503778955432,3.8059428063999263,7.905849993497144,3.900174431363043,3.892300374932137,4.1302590120314875,4.176068548062782,4.383707912841026,4.456830177669989,4.422928625994308,4.933754249760298,5.719991853386255,5.7959777603641776,6.389041482367141,6.948657270302562,20.605843687887077]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815675E-4,2.455731171235748E-4,2.4563375102320027E-4,2.4558437078212703E-4,2.4560761242976696E-4,2.45571763107492E-4,2.456481393351679E-4,2.455352260343835E-4,2.4557316902294263E-4,2.4582694228272666E-4,2.4777750751927847E-4,2.455735746463144E-4,2.458061483401663E-4,2.4583175709999225E-4,2.457200821515688E-4,2.455853381034189E-4,2.456698289576873E-4,2.4578544201440554E-4,2.455980166155372E-4,2.4559711868482105E-4,2.4581807062765696E-4,2.456217250087548E-4,2.4562209673594936E-4,2.457794448809529E-4,2.45598105208926E-4,2.4583469539626136E-4,2.456595651838667E-4,2.455725667432639E-4,2.456838988504997E-4,2.4575888511788307E-4,2.45622929823069E-4,2.457544801154607E-4,2.4587513942998107E-4,2.461033496844448E-4,2.456591406772316E-4,2.455851891520182E-4,2.4567373648188087E-4,2.456101306213583E-4,2.455354880977232E-4,2.4559794055782814E-4,2.458440716644705E-4,2.457092107159916E-4,2.457550401475784E-4,2.455477083715588E-4,2.4559800300716274E-4,2.455850968026104E-4,2.4566822513123824E-4,2.457108243085359E-4,2.4566086040087184E-4,2.4562192272047713E-4,2.455857041156839E-4,2.460888693409167E-4,2.456475005531107E-4,2.4559794671641226E-4,2.4564618501976256E-4,2.455728179973833E-4,0.9805906755843553,2.4561113145798026E-4,2.455860488865796E-4,2.455726778181562E-4,2.4576914185124127E-4,2.4567048395681887E-4,2.455725751623289E-4,2.4554760832986997E-4,2.4552291580549E-4,2.457449073872681E-4,2.4558460558531494E-4,2.4569623921273035E-4,2.457683448302725E-4,2.4565684451475215E-4,2.4559827200275683E-4,2.45547930226422E-4,2.4561074592378634E-4,2.455477979712656E-4,2.4556068392259204E-4,2.455479371760405E-4,2.457073321002017E-4,2.4563420173500777E-4,2.4557290293850706E-4,2.4559669127792536E-4]}}
{"value":"This one acts as a satire during the women's rights movement era. Of course, that doesn't mean COACH (the movie) is a wonderful experience to behold. It runs into the same vein as FASTBREAK (which was better, but still tame), and is basically standard fare fluff. What I mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize. Anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatics earning their way to sudden victory makes waste. It's the same feeling you may get after watching this. A nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a man's duty, but I expected better things.","finished_norm":["thi","on","act","a","a","satir","dure","the","woman","right","movem","era","of","cours","that","doe","not","mean","coach","the","movi","be","a","wonder","experi","to","behold","it","run","into","the","same","vein","a","fastbreak","which","be","well","but","still","tame","and","be","basic","standard","fare","fluff","what","i","mean","for","thi","movi","be","uninterest","be","simpl","to","recogn","anybodi","who","serv","time","awai","from","a","normal","job","by","train","a","bunch","of","lunat","earn","their","wai","to","sudden","victori","make","wast","it","the","same","feel","you","mai","get","after","watch","thi","a","nice","attempt","at","cast","the","opposit","sex","for","a","man","duti","but","i","expect","well","thing"],"filtered":["thi","act","satir","dure","woman","right","movem","era","cours","doe","mean","coach","movi","wonder","experi","behold","run","vein","fastbreak","well","still","tame","basic","standard","fare","fluff","mean","thi","movi","uninterest","simpl","recogn","anybodi","serv","time","awai","normal","job","train","bunch","lunat","earn","wai","sudden","victori","make","wast","feel","mai","get","watch","thi","nice","attempt","cast","opposit","sex","man","duti","expect","well","thing"],"filtered2":["act","satir","dure","woman","right","movem","era","cours","doe","mean","coach","wonder","experi","behold","run","vein","fastbreak","well","still","tame","basic","standard","fare","fluff","mean","uninterest","simpl","recogn","anybodi","serv","time","awai","normal","job","train","bunch","lunat","earn","wai","sudden","victori","make","wast","feel","mai","get","watch","nice","attempt","cast","opposit","sex","man","duti","expect","well","thing"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,8,18,20,21,29,33,43,45,46,64,70,88,89,92,121,130,137,155,175,177,199,239,254,262,286,289,333,419,616,700,713,736,815,1204,1209,1247,1278,1568,1652,1659,1776,1784,2045,2296,2914,3257,3614,3944,4051,4892,4901],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,8,18,20,21,29,33,43,45,46,64,70,88,89,92,121,130,137,155,175,177,199,239,254,262,286,289,333,419,616,700,713,736,815,1204,1209,1247,1278,1568,1652,1659,1776,1784,2045,2296,2914,3257,3614,3944,4051,4892,4901],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.6608112036218214,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.883428577602134,2.094675786251684,4.063444682693467,1.9940046109572438,2.0489535369135887,2.2190595059394194,2.2642139034199635,2.2939035841256437,2.3074766467914385,2.3791142619576227,2.458149992634611,2.558331832813986,2.6593400337329487,2.889652074525771,2.726701583487816,2.780700890737216,2.8282659991423613,2.948928684455311,3.1758963322079246,3.5173618574831282,3.616452760127359,3.865219416329466,3.6841709341823097,3.7881170224473255,4.3215761317340196,4.3095999406873045,4.327618446189983,4.535724120139652,4.597282013139085,4.646072177308517,4.688631791727313,4.760735085628657,4.77960356993304,4.911775343041523,5.116075806554253,5.695894301807195,5.604922523601468,5.672363804397,5.850044981634453,5.878215858601149,6.137727054086234,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247368E-4,2.1540780663323995E-4,2.1546099248468385E-4,2.1541767793321662E-4,2.154380646612075E-4,2.154066189395789E-4,2.1547361338862645E-4,2.1537456994793317E-4,2.1540785215747778E-4,2.156304528310065E-4,2.1734141771275793E-4,2.154082079555466E-4,2.1561221314088627E-4,2.1563467621359277E-4,2.155367190105506E-4,2.1541852643227154E-4,2.1549263873663E-4,2.15594050305036E-4,2.1542964756197323E-4,2.1542885992980752E-4,2.1562267093784912E-4,2.1545044370220885E-4,2.1545076976778386E-4,2.1558878983769228E-4,2.1542972527287165E-4,2.1563725358021162E-4,2.1548363572753695E-4,2.154073238596491E-4,2.1550498033487083E-4,2.155707555613039E-4,2.154515005215051E-4,2.1556689165339277E-4,2.1567272961560592E-4,2.1587290735061636E-4,2.1548326336575632E-4,2.1541839577752037E-4,2.1549606627473258E-4,2.1544027352728257E-4,2.1537479982036334E-4,2.1542958084691711E-4,2.1564547810166165E-4,2.1552718298266583E-4,2.155673828931975E-4,2.1538551900010994E-4,2.154296356252021E-4,2.1541831477197865E-4,2.154912319184015E-4,2.1552859836735787E-4,2.1548477184478573E-4,2.1545061712774073E-4,2.154188474849182E-4,2.1586020571993616E-4,2.1547305307223892E-4,2.1542958624900312E-4,2.1547189913423303E-4,2.1540754425062426E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.154411514247661E-4,2.154191499054083E-4,2.154074212905047E-4,2.1557975239475937E-4,2.1549321327804535E-4,2.1540733124454666E-4,2.1538543124717907E-4,2.1536377186288152E-4,2.1555849480439063E-4,2.1541788389403308E-4,2.1551580485178987E-4,2.1557905327695395E-4,2

{"value":"I have always liked Spike Lee's movies, but this one was a total waste of 2 1/2 hours. I expected more about Son of Sam and instead got a movie that seemed to have very little to do with the 1977 serial killings. The talking dog was laughable (you know you're in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately). The whole movie seemed very disjointed and not very interesting. The sex scenes were totally irrelevent to the plot. I'm not opposed to sex in movies, but it should have some point (unless it's a XXX movie). All in all, we were very disappointed at this Spike Lee effort!!","finished_norm":["i","have","alwai","like","spike","lee","movi","but","thi","on","be","a","total","wast","of","hour","i","expect","much","about","son","of","sam","and","instead","get","a","movi","that","seem","to","have","veri","littl","to","do","with","the","serial","kill","the","talk","dog","be","laughabl","you","know","you","re","in","troubl","when","all","the","movi","patron","burst","into","laughter","inappropri","the","whole","movi","seem","veri","disjoint","and","not","veri","interest","the","sex","scene","be","total","irrelev","to","the","plot","i","be","not","oppos","to","sex","in","movi","but","it","should","have","some","point","unless","it","a","xxx","movi","all","in","all","we","be","veri","disappoint","at","thi","spike","lee","effort"],"filtered":["alwai","like","spike","lee","movi","thi","total","wast","hour","expect","much","son","sam","instead","get","movi","seem","veri","littl","serial","kill","talk","dog","laughabl","know","re","troubl","movi","patron","burst","laughter","inappropri","whole","movi","seem","veri","disjoint","veri","interest","sex","scene","total","irrelev","plot","oppos","sex","movi","point","unless","xxx","movi","veri","disappoint","thi","spike","lee","effort"],"filtered2":["alwai","like","spike","lee","total","wast","hour","expect","son","sam","instead","get","seem","veri","littl","serial","kill","talk","dog","laughabl","know","re","troubl","patron","burst","laughter","inappropri","whole","seem","veri","disjoint","veri","interest","sex","scene","total","irrelev","plot","oppos","sex","point","unless","xxx","veri","disappoint","spike","lee","effort"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,14,15,19,26,32,35,60,66,68,76,89,111,130,152,174,184,186,187,197,254,401,434,460,552,570,609,752,1058,1134,1733,2247,2328,2356,2591,2828,2856,4216],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,14,15,19,26,32,35,60,66,68,76,89,111,130,152,174,184,186,187,197,254,401,434,460,552,570,609,752,1058,1134,1733,2247,2328,2356,2591,2828,2856,4216],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,1.1175081997259209,4.800243119426277,1.312380678011735,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,2.926338025798268,1.838176641236591,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,2.1337665533324026,1.9940046109572438,2.1183455303375887,2.2642139034199635,2.3131195476980753,2.456282578459816,4.992499677733764,2.571852579609833,2.4732161909892554,2.558331832813986,5.779304149051542,3.0879275592619675,3.4101163271295305,3.216957819005698,3.424750734647968,7.889252387867754,3.68099128126493,3.719831114581194,4.589376833631972,4.403125998698128,4.760735085628657,5.064116067623542,5.102830579804232,5.129498826886393,11.003476574732474,5.3064295350454715,5.373120909544144,5.9370563586240825]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.560351204035198E-4,2.55808234739393E-4,2.558713957686223E-4,2.558199574334824E-4,2.5584416775798716E-4,2.558068242899595E-4,2.558863837637597E-4,2.5576876440667947E-4,2.558082888018484E-4,2.5607263894884244E-4,2.5810450080632457E-4,2.5580871133099124E-4,2.56050978346078E-4,2.560776544404392E-4,2.55961325048381E-4,2.5582096507126864E-4,2.559089773770747E-4,2.5602940901184947E-4,2.558341720046744E-4,2.558332366495586E-4,2.560633975365528E-4,2.5585886852800947E-4,2.5585925574823356E-4,2.5602316192690794E-4,2.558342642905022E-4,2.560807152004708E-4,2.558982858246215E-4,2.558076614200599E-4,2.5592363368182606E-4,2.5600174526388246E-4,2.558601235571695E-4,2.559971566675944E-4,2.5612284488059524E-4,2.563605665947128E-4,2.558978436251893E-4,2.558208099117979E-4,2.559130477609908E-4,2.5584679090401085E-4,2.557690373924245E-4,2.558340927769946E-4,2.560904822574154E-4,2.559500005077445E-4,2.5599774004100715E-4,2.557817669888662E-4,2.5583415782912345E-4,2.5582071371340595E-4,2.559073067055551E-4,2.5595168135239543E-4,2.558996350243205E-4,2.558590744800586E-4,2.558213463383735E-4,2.563454827322781E-4,2.5588571835822855E-4,2.5583409919225926E-4,2.5588434799543206E-4,2.558079231460725E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.558478334539957E-4,2.558217054788008E-4,2.5580777712438637E-4,2.560124294824373E-4,2.5590965967558344E-4,2.5580767019001876E-4,2.557816627775904E-4,2.5575594110598853E-4,2.5598718496251004E-4,2.558202020229135E-4,2.5593648837176627E-4,2.5601159924283515E-4,2.5589545176211645E-4,2.558344380360487E-4,2.557819980903059E-4,2.558474318513173E-4,2.557818603229538E-4,2.557952833413214E-4,2.5578200532957394E-4,2.559480435940782E-4,2.55871865265419E-4,2.558080116274143E-4,2.5583279142898734E-4]}}

The deaf, mute guy is fine, the underdog wins - that's good, the cricket aspect is great, but the movie is average overall.

I'm sure the movie could have been made more interesting.

{"value":"One of the worst movies I ever saw. My only thought was: \"how can I get my money back from Hollywood Video\". This is no way worth four dollars, or any dollars. I think it was an attempt to rip off The Mexican, or Vin Diesel's movies, but it failed miserably to do this.<br /><br />The acting was terrible, I felt sorry for the actors that they couldn't find something better to do with their time. The story was ridiculous. We were calling out the lines ahead of the actors, it was so predictable.

{"value":"Saw this movie recently and had higher hopes. Not so much based upon the director, who hadn't made a cinematographic release before, but more based upon its cast. Harvey Keitel, Scott Glenn and Craig Wasson (lead role in Body double, a Brian De Palma masterpiece) have all starred in great movies. Not together though, and this fact hasn't exactly changed because of this one.<br /><br />The film is unbelievable, very predictable and cliché. The only thing that might make it slightly appealing is the selection of locations on which it's been shot.

{"value":"When you look back at another bad Nightmare sequel like Freddy's Revenge, you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new. And although The Dream Child is more enjoyable it offers absolutely nothing new to the series. Yes, there's the creative deaths as usual, like a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing \"Super Freddy\" but even scenes like that aren't used to their full potential and the parts without Freddy are just boring.<br /><br />This marked the official death of scariness to the series. Freddy seems to be the comedic relief now...but to what?<br /><br />My Rating:

{"value":"The movie itself is so pathetic. It portrayed deaf people as cynical toward hearing people. True, some deaf people are wary of dating hearing people, but they are not necessarily angry like of Marlee Matlin's character was throughout the story. Deaf people do not go to the bar and dance the way Matlin did. All in all, the movie itself is more boring than pathetic. It is so boring that I'd like to believe that it is an insomnia-cured movie. If I have a problem sleeping, I can simply pop in Children of a Lesser God and watch. It will put me to sleep.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this is a deaf guy talking.","finished_norm":["the","movi","itself","be","so","pathet","it","portrai","deaf","peopl","a","cynic","toward","hear","peopl","true","some","deaf","peopl","be","wari","of","date","hear","peopl","but","thei","be","not","necessarili","angri","like","of","marle","matlin","charact","be","throughout","the","stori","deaf","peopl","do","not","go","to","the","bar","and","danc","the","wai","matlin","do","all","in","all","the","movi","itself","be","much","bore","than","pathet","it","be","so","bore","that","i","have","like","to","believ","that","it","be","a","insomniacur","movi","if","i","have","a","problem","sleep","i","can","simpli","pop","in","child","of","a","lesser","god","and","watch","it","will","put","me","to","sleepbr","br","keep","in","mind","thi","be","a","deaf","gui","talk"],"filtered":["movi","pathet","portrai","deaf","peopl","cynic","toward","hear","peopl","true","deaf","peopl","wari","date","hear","peopl","thei","necessarili","angri","like","marle","matlin","charact","throughout","stori","deaf","peopl","go","bar","danc","wai","matlin","movi","much","bore","pathet","bore","like","believ","insomniacur","movi","problem","sleep","simpli","pop","child","lesser","god","watch","put","sleepbr","br","keep","mind","thi","deaf","gui","talk"],"filtered2":["pathet","portrai","deaf","peopl","cynic","toward","hear","peopl","true","deaf","peopl","wari","date","hear","peopl","necessarili","angri","like","marle","matlin","charact","throughout","stori","deaf","peopl","go","bar","danc","wai","matlin","bore","pathet","bore","like","believ","insomniacur","problem","sleep","simpli","pop","child","lesser","god","watch","put","sleepbr","keep","mind","deaf","gui","talk"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,7,10,17,23,33,55,91,108,134,159,167,180,186,201,216,238,304,352,438,469,492,563,602,647,732,952,1070,1161,2149,2286,2724,3274,7172],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,7,10,17,23,33,55,91,108,134,159,167,180,186,201,216,238,304,352,438,469,492,563,602,647,732,952,1070,1161,2149,2286,2724,3274,7172],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,6.824238636878905,1.4018535447685214,1.9536997889255368,2.0105926690411424,4.277015007255866,2.2443961816702407,2.300267965194495,2.4609576687888097,2.7097314792693545,2.571852579609833,2.561435818751577,5.2140373930679385,2.597304642813496,2.871119826396843,3.1236456418640466,3.1797351085150902,3.328770687675578,3.6016814428070463,3.459754308221302,7.013275788240304,3.6746621462132825,3.7099788181381825,3.9868265484242533,4.176068548062782,4.327618446189983,5.116075806554253,5.051537285416681,5.390512652256013,24.405437639661436,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6148425534859354E-4,2.612525409305092E-4,2.613170462009934E-4,2.6126451311592587E-4,2.6128923870304415E-4,2.6125110046281385E-4,2.6133235318208836E-4,2.612122305600347E-4,2.61252596143563E-4,2.6152257239224757E-4,2.6359767792933384E-4,2.612530276652938E-4,2.6150045079199473E-4,2.615276946273664E-4,2.614088894243554E-4,2.612655421990289E-4,2.6135542764993473E-4,2.614784224027244E-4,2.612790302124765E-4,2.612780749504188E-4,2.6151313429716464E-4,2.613042523460798E-4,2.613046478074204E-4,2.6147204236255076E-4,2.6127912446240176E-4,2.615308205288302E-4,2.6134450855169804E-4,2.612519554093562E-4,2.6137039588135566E-4,2.614501698937487E-4,2.6130553408572875E-4,2.614454836394505E-4,2.61573846844978E-4,2.618166279341436E-4,2.613440569410398E-4,2.6126538373733585E-4,2.6135958466286957E-4,2.612919176768646E-4,2.6121250935567074E-4,2.612789492986127E-4,2.6154079545573903E-4,2.613973238661975E-4,2.6144607942866165E-4,2.612255098731045E-4,2.612790157352306E-4,2.6126528549157623E-4,2.6135372142190814E-4,2.6139904048386777E-4,2.6134588646609526E-4,2.613044626813577E-4,2.612659315805514E-4,2.618012230454303E-4,2.6133167361488854E-4,2.612789558504119E-4,2.613302740869846E-4,2.612522227056217E-4,0.9793514233938281,2.612929824151943E-4,2.6126629836447957E-4,2.6125207357619056E-4,2.614610815020015E-4,2.613561244696414E-4,2.612519643659641E-4,2.612254034439247E-4,2.6119913434406635E-4,2.61435299708924E-4,2.61264762910896E-4,2.613835241546232E-4,2.614602335926061E-4,2.613416141725106E-4,2.612793019057336E-4,2.6122574589302147E-4,2.6129257226530106E-4,2.612256051935994E-4,2.6123931389089393E-4,2.612257532863612E-4,2.613953253040002E-4,2.613175256899794E-4,2.61252313070091E-4,2.6127762025432335E-4]}}

{"value":"I saw this back in '94 when it was finally released. Apparently because Orion pictures was in bankruptcy, I think, the movie had not been released a couple of years earlier.<br /><br />I have problem remembering details partly because I haven't seen it in a long time, but I do remember it as a very dull movie. I kept debating whether to walk out of it. The store was not at all interesting or engaging. Was a 3rd rate America Graffiti imitation. <br /><br />None of the performances make it worth watching either. One of the biggest disappointments since a local newspaper reviewer gave it a high rating.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","back","in","when","it","be","final","releas","appar","becaus","orion","pictur","be","in","bankruptci","i","think","the","movi","have","not","be","releas","a","coupl","of","year","earlierbr","br","i","have","problem","rememb","detail","partli","becaus","i","have","not","see","it","in","a","long","time","but","i","do","rememb","it","a","a","veri","dull","movi","i","keep","debat","whether","to","walk","out","of","it","the","store","be","not","at","all","interest","or","engag","be","a","rd","rate","america","graffito","imit","br","br","none","of","the","perform","make","it","worth","watch","either","on","of","the","big","disappoint","sinc","a","local","newspap","review","give","it","a","high","rate"],"filtered":["see","thi","back","final","releas","appar","becaus","orion","pictur","bankruptci","think","movi","releas","coupl","year","earlierbr","br","problem","rememb","detail","partli","becaus","see","long","time","rememb","veri","dull","movi","keep","debat","whether","walk","store","interest","engag","rd","rate","america","graffito","imit","br","br","none","perform","make","worth","watch","either","big","disappoint","sinc","local","newspap","review","give","high","rate"],"filtered2":["see","back","final","releas","appar","becaus","orion","pictur","bankruptci","think","releas","coupl","year","earlierbr","problem","rememb","detail","partli","becaus","see","long","time","rememb","veri","dull","keep","debat","whether","walk","store","interest","engag","rd","rate","america","graffito","imit","none","perform","make","worth","watch","either","big","disappoint","sinc","local","newspap","review","give","high","rate"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,12,15,22,30,57,60,63,82,99,105,134,156,162,167,176,187,202,207,211,219,253,290,294,308,311,327,367,370,475,597,740,793,808,943,1684,2565,2656,2824,3069,7340],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,12,15,22,30,57,60,63,82,99,105,134,156,162,167,176,187,202,207,211,219,253,290,294,308,311,327,367,370,475,597,740,793,808,943,1684,2565,2656,2824,3069,7340],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,2.5958480334723544,1.3364419891718522,1.834162586674748,1.838176641236591,1.8729627573220065,2.020196584395323,2.056430207256609,2.1765612129984904,2.2443961816702407,2.3451551414151686,2.3586007221245198,2.4609576687888097,2.5040471493269134,2.4732161909892554,5.194609285626992,2.5531798379045583,2.5687161421197025,2.5792094178355414,2.7073305177318163,5.7225627547931115,2.886778509330039,2.8753661172782943,2.9203338091782562,5.934838391705887,3.0791938792932125,2.9958122703541616,3.3721070011625462,3.4986697244709752,3.7165362186843414,3.770603439954617,3.90413483257914,3.9911462095687695,4.724033718778229,5.290429193699031,5.290429193699031,5.390512652256013,5.583416318380505,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815707E-4,2.4557311712357507E-4,2.4563375102320054E-4,2.455843707821273E-4,2.456076124297672E-4,2.455717631074923E-4,2.456481393351682E-4,2.4553522603438377E-4,2.455731690229429E-4,2.4582694228272693E-4,2.4777750751927874E-4,2.4557357464631465E-4,2.458061483401666E-4,2.458317570999926E-4,2.457200821515691E-4,2.4558533810341916E-4,2.4566982895768755E-4,2.4578544201440586E-4,2.455980166155375E-4,2.455971186848213E-4,2.4581807062765723E-4,2.456217250087551E-4,2.4562209673594963E-4,2.4577944488095315E-4,2.455981052089263E-4,2.4583469539626163E-4,2.4565956518386695E-4,2.4557256674326424E-4,2.4568389885049996E-4,2.457588851178834E-4,2.4562292982306926E-4,2.45754480115461E-4,2.4587513942998134E-4,2.461033496844451E-4,2.4565914067723187E-4,2.4558518915201847E-4,2.4567373648188114E-4,2.4561013062135857E-4,2.4553548809772355E-4,2.455979405578284E-4,2.4584407166447074E-4,2.457092107159919E-4,2.457550401475787E-4,2.455477083715591E-4,2.45598003007163E-4,2.455850968026107E-4,2.4566822513123857E-4,2.4571082430853615E-4,2.456608604008721E-4,2.456219227204774E-4,2.4558570411568415E-4,2.4608886934091695E-4,2.45647500553111E-4,2.455979467164125E-4,2.4564618501976283E-4,2.455728179973836E-4,0.9805906755843552,2.4561113145798053E-4,2.4558604888657985E-4,2.4557267781815653E-4,2.4576914185124154E-4,2.4567048395681914E-4,2.4557257516232917E-4,2.4554760832987024E-4,2.455229158054903E-4,2.4574490738726835E-4,2.455846055853152E-4,2.456962392127306E-4,2.457683448302728E-4,2.456568445147524E-4,2.455982720027571E-4,2.455479302264223E-4,2.4561074592378666E-4,2.455477979712659E-4,2.455606839225923E-4,2.4554793717604075E-4,2.4570733210020195E-4,2.4563420173500804E-4,2.4557290293850733E-4,2.4559669127792563E-4]}}
{"value":"Skip Mission: Galactica and watch the original Living Legend episodes instead. The network took parts 1 & 2 of Living Legend and jammed them into one plot with the awful Fire In Space episode. Although Galactica suffered from network-controlled writing and a lack of time to prepare for a proper production, Living Legend is the best of the 1978 TV series. Fire in Space, on its own, is one of the worst episodes. As a historical note, watch Galactica, the original Star Trek, and then the revival Trek series, and you'll see the difference in quality between network-produced sci-fi and syndicated sci-fi.","finished_norm":["skip","mission","galactica","and","watch","the","origin","live","legend","episod","instead","the","network","take","part","of","live","legend","and","jam","them","into","on","plot","with","the","aw","fire","in","space","episod","although","galactica","suffer","from","networkcontrol","write","and","a","lack","of","time","to","prepar","for","a","proper","product","live","legend","be","the","well","of","the","tv","seri","fire","in","space","on","it","own","be","on","of","the","wrong","episod","a","a","histor","note","watch","galactica","the","origin","star","trek","and","then","the","reviv","trek","seri","and","you","will","see","the","differ","in","qualiti","between","networkproduc","scifi","and","syndic","scifi"],"filtered":["skip","mission","galactica","watch","origin","live","legend","episod","instead","network","take","part","live","legend","jam","plot","aw","fire","space","episod","although","galactica","suffer","networkcontrol","write","lack","time","prepar","proper","product","live","legend","well","tv","seri","fire","space","wrong","episod","histor","note","watch","galactica","origin","star","trek","reviv","trek","seri","see","differ","qualiti","networkproduc","scifi","syndic","scifi"],"filtered2":["skip","mission","galactica","watch","origin","live","legend","instead","network","take","part","live","legend","jam","plot","aw","fire","space","although","galactica","suffer","networkcontrol","write","lack","time","prepar","proper","product","live","legend","well","tv","fire","space","wrong","histor","note","watch","galactica","origin","star","trek","reviv","trek","see","differ","qualiti","networkproduc","scifi","syndic","scifi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,8,20,25,31,32,61,65,69,100,116,138,152,172,183,190,204,237,319,551,560,633,637,781,931,953,1295,1377,1618,1643,1791,2304,2939,4287,4574,7496],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,8,20,25,31,32,61,65,69,100,116,138,152,172,183,190,204,237,319,551,560,633,637,781,931,953,1295,1377,1618,1643,1791,2304,2939,4287,4574,7496],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,4.254065042302116,2.1405462403177813,6.739988699036795,2.2907365189289424,2.3131195476980753,2.5001408943598484,2.4885128563647294,2.558331832813986,2.624524614047584,2.640097787510554,2.9056060024680126,7.056404144071986,3.4623020803001006,3.550241531602284,7.486408931533005,7.872791389594723,3.9241755834625858,4.1302590120314875,4.358390104856736,13.675099790668234,4.605250182788262,4.770124825978496,4.8184434032493035,10.678438715736926,5.521540914662417,19.46737482277237,6.101359409915359,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815675E-4,2.455731171235748E-4,2.4563375102320027E-4,2.4558437078212703E-4,2.4560761242976696E-4,2.45571763107492E-4,2.456481393351679E-4,2.455352260343835E-4,2.4557316902294263E-4,2.4582694228272666E-4,2.4777750751927847E-4,2.455735746463144E-4,2.458061483401663E-4,2.4583175709999225E-4,2.457200821515688E-4,2.455853381034189E-4,2.456698289576873E-4,2.4578544201440554E-4,2.455980166155372E-4,2.4559711868482105E-4,2.4581807062765696E-4,2.456217250087548E-4,2.4562209673594936E-4,2.457794448809529E-4,2.45598105208926E-4,2.4583469539626136E-4,2.456595651838667E-4,2.455725667432639E-4,2.456838988504997E-4,2.4575888511788307E-4,2.45622929823069E-4,2.457544801154607E-4,2.4587513942998107E-4,2.461033496844448E-4,2.456591406772316E-4,2.455851891520182E-4,2.4567373648188087E-4,2.456101306213583E-4,2.455354880977232E-4,2.4559794055782814E-4,2.458440716644705E-4,2.457092107159916E-4,2.457550401475784E-4,2.455477083715588E-4,2.4559800300716274E-4,2.455850968026104E-4,2.4566822513123824E-4,2.457108243085359E-4,2.4566086040087184E-4,2.4562192272047713E-4,2.455857041156839E-4,2.460888693409167E-4,2.456475005531107E-4,2.4559794671641226E-4,2.4564618501976256E-4,2.455728179973833E-4,0.9805906755843553,2.4561113145798026E-4,2.455860488865796E-4,2.455726778181562E-4,2.4576914185124127E-4,2.4567048395681887E-4,2.455725751623289E-4,2.4554760832986997E-4,2.4552291580549E-4,2.457449073872681E-4,2.4558460558531494E-4,2.4569623921273035E-4,2.457683448302725E-4,2.4565684451475215E-4,2.4559827200275683E-4,2.45547930226422E-4,2.4561074592378634E-4,2.455477979712656E-4,2.4556068392259204E-4,2.455479371760405E-4,2.457073321002017E-4,2.4563420173500777E-4,2.4557290293850706E-4,2.4559669127792536E-4]}}

Horus - and the other Egyption gods - was successfully made in CG and very close to the comic version. <br /><br />I think with real actors this movie could have been a cult movie. <br /><br />What a shame.","finished_norm":["i","love","the","comic","although","i","do","have","problem","fulli","understand","the","stori","the","visual","styl","be","uniqu","with","all","it","dirt","dust","and","decai","so","i","think","i","know","what","i","be","up","for","surprisingli","i","understand","the","main","plot","but","some","extrem","poorli","decis","where","make","for","it","visual","styl","br","br","i","mean","realli","bad","look","cg","human","actorsin","close","up","why","it","do","not","work","at","all","horu","and","the","other","egypt","god","be","successfulli","make","in","cg","and","veri","close","to","the","comic","version","br","br","i","think","with","real","actor","thi","movi","can","have","be","a","cult","movi","br","br","what","a","shame"],"filtered":["love","comic","although","problem","fulli","understand","stori","visual","styl","uniqu","dirt","dust","decai","think","know","surprisingli","understand","main","plot","extrem","poorli","decis","make","visual","styl","br","br","mean","realli","bad","look","cg","human","actorsin","close","work","horu","egypt","god","successfulli","make","cg","veri","close","comic","version","br","br","think","real","actor","thi","movi","cult","movi","br","br","shame"],"filtered2":["love","comic","although","problem","fulli","understand","stori","visual","styl","uniqu","dirt","dust","decai","think","know","surprisingli","understand","main","plot","extrem","poorli","decis","make","visual","styl","mean","realli","bad","look","cg","human","actorsin","close","work","horu","egypt","god","successfulli","make","cg","veri","close","comic","version","think","real","actor","cult","shame"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,9,12,13,15,16,17,26,32,41,48,54,80,88,167,179,212,220,237,292,295,329,352,380,398,480,574,635,933,1300,1367,1398,1483,2519,2805,2895,3873,5193,5781],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,9,12,13,15,16,17,26,32,41,48,54,80,88,167,179,212,220,237,292,295,329,352,380,398,480,574,635,933,1300,1367,1398,1483,2519,2805,2895,3873,5193,5781],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.0683570856722073,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.8113893252729412,1.9951803900462557,2.0317223413467334,2.4609576687888097,2.507968722980095,5.196758667886523,2.8336934208777267,2.640097787510554,2.9752256367457734,5.5821542374466135,2.951986790814132,3.1236456418640466,6.204124140393744,3.143848349181566,6.86925471628776,3.5039747767006686,7.174250290065678,4.091229668125752,4.3773181147422555,4.416284083275639,4.429617614145104,4.5432147918688095,5.156897801074508,5.408212229355414,11.39178860361439,5.770002273960917,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040352005E-4,2.558082347393933E-4,2.558713957686226E-4,2.5581995743348266E-4,2.5584416775798743E-4,2.5580682428995977E-4,2.5588638376375996E-4,2.5576876440667974E-4,2.5580828880184865E-4,2.560726389488427E-4,2.5810450080632474E-4,2.558087113309915E-4,2.5605097834607827E-4,2.560776544404394E-4,2.5596132504838125E-4,2.558209650712689E-4,2.559089773770749E-4,2.560294090118497E-4,2.558341720046747E-4,2.5583323664955885E-4,2.5606339753655305E-4,2.5585886852800974E-4,2.5585925574823383E-4,2.5602316192690816E-4,2.558342642905025E-4,2.5608071520047106E-4,2.558982858246218E-4,2.5580766142006015E-4,2.5592363368182633E-4,2.5600174526388273E-4,2.558601235571697E-4,2.5599715666759464E-4,2.561228448805955E-4,2.56360566594713E-4,2.5589784362518956E-4,2.558208099117982E-4,2.5591304776099105E-4,2.558467909040111E-4,2.5576903739242475E-4,2.558340927769949E-4,2.560904822574157E-4,2.559500005077448E-4,2.559977400410074E-4,2.5578176698886647E-4,2.558341578291237E-4,2.558207137134062E-4,2.5590730670555536E-4,2.559516813523957E-4,2.5589963502432075E-4,2.558590744800589E-4,2.5582134633837377E-4,2.5634548273227836E-4,2.5588571835822877E-4,2.558340991922595E-4,2.558843479954323E-4,2.5580792314607275E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.5584783345399594E-4,2.5582170547880107E-4,2.5580777712438664E-4,2.560124294824376E-4,2.559096596755837E-4,2.55807670190019E-4,2.557816627775907E-4,2.557559411059888E-4,2.559871849625103E-4,2.558202020229138E-4,2.559364883717665E-4,2.560115992428354E-4,2.558954517621167E-4,2.55834438036049E-4,2.5578199809030616E-4,2.558474318513176E-4,2.5578186032295405E-4,2.5579528334132166E-4,2.557820053295742E-4,2.5594804359407847E-4,2.558718652654193E-4,2.558080116274146E-4,2.5583279142898756E-4]}}
{"value":"This is not a good movie. Too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par. The 3D was OK, but not superb. I almost fell asleep in this movie.<br /><br />The story is about 3 young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it. The characters are lacking, I truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested. Pixar this is not.<br /><br />I would have liked to see more special 3D effects. Also I wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying \"Lord of the flies\" Pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and

{"value":"This is one of them movies that has a awesome video box but has wired camra work and unknown actors that speak with bad dialogue.Its so dark when the killings happen you can hardly see it plus the movie is hard to understand.The only star in this is WCW`s Vanessa Sanchez (Tygres in WCW before it folded) and she is a good actress. I like low budget film especialy ones that has errors because they are fun to watch but Severed unfourtunatly isn`t one of them.This movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but this is no blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent Severed.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","them","movi","that","have","a","awesom","video","box","but","have","wire","camra","work","and","unknown","actor","that","speak","with","bad","dialogueit","so","dark","when","the","kill","happen","you","can","hardli","see","it","plu","the","movi","be","hard","to","understandth","onli","star","in","thi","be","wcw","vanessa","sanchez","tygr","in","wcw","befor","it","fold","and","she","be","a","good","actress","i","like","low","budget","film","especiali","on","that","have","error","becaus","thei","be","fun","to","watch","but","sever","unfourtunatli","isnt","on","of","themthi","movi","be","okai","to","see","if","you","like","voodoo","and","sever","head","but","thi","be","no","blockbust","but","if","you","ne","someth","new","to","watch","then","rend","sever"],"filtered":["thi","movi","awesom","video","box","wire","camra","work","unknown","actor","speak","bad","dialogueit","dark","kill","happen","hardli","see","plu","movi","hard","understandth","onli","star","thi","wcw","vanessa","sanchez","tygr","wcw","befor","fold","good","actress","like","low","budget","film","especiali","error","becaus","thei","fun","watch","sever","unfourtunatli","isnt","themthi","movi","okai","see","like","voodoo","sever","head","thi","blockbust","ne","someth","new","watch","rend","sever"],"filtered2":["awesom","video","box","wire","camra","work","unknown","actor","speak","bad","dialogueit","dark","kill","happen","hardli","see","plu","hard","understandth","onli","star","wcw","vanessa","sanchez","tygr","wcw","befor","fold","good","actress","like","low","budget","especiali","error","becaus","fun","watch","sever","unfourtunatli","isnt","themthi","okai","see","like","voodoo","sever","head","blockbust","ne","someth","new","watch","rend","sever"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,9,11,22,41,48,53,76,79,87,94,100,110,171,191,208,217,240,256,259,316,344,355,368,533,654,665,749,1512,1679,1680,1911,3395,3877,3991,6435,7430],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,9,11,22,41,48,53,76,79,87,94,100,110,171,191,208,217,240,256,259,316,344,355,368,533,654,665,749,1512,1679,1680,1911,3395,3877,3991,6435,7430],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.2979240167361772,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.7003182735607676,2.1337665533324026,1.9469506069506084,2.115024371522662,2.08112281984698,2.1405462403177813,2.1290479736304078,2.373087554090762,2.5460113484259455,2.6289494000279396,2.6113665294700725,2.7666071276613566,2.748952192422636,2.7464553122240485,8.634621084839694,2.983093497946387,3.0316467233633775,3.1346146732346205,3.424750734647968,3.634471265630037,3.5929222627171646,3.7165362186843414,4.566029469634981,4.706176101378222,4.671389985292807,4.890269137820559,5.672363804397,6.137727054086234,5.907203395474402,6.489124940924123,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.671703793782348E-4,2.66933626198184E-4,2.6699953417250606E-4,2.669458587255898E-4,2.669711219846795E-4,2.669321544066983E-4,2.670151740126212E-4,2.668924392557495E-4,2.669336826118771E-4,2.67209529647822E-4,2.693297607493638E-4,2.669341235172936E-4,2.671869270007749E-4,2.6721476326886016E-4,2.670933745790584E-4,2.6694691018669094E-4,2.670387502479102E-4,2.6716441959163625E-4,2.669606915046714E-4,2.669597154698963E-4,2.671998863159871E-4,2.669864621079322E-4,2.669868661688048E-4,2.6715790081385603E-4,2.6696078780411497E-4,2.672179571448313E-4,2.670275937076647E-4,2.6693302794454014E-4,2.6705404397204673E-4,2.67135552715765E-4,2.6698777171973965E-4,2.671307645561986E-4,2.672619190927242E-4,2.6750997959492067E-4,2.670271322764756E-4,2.6694674827915815E-4,2.6704299765745843E-4,2.669738592143112E-4,2.6689272411395545E-4,2.669606088312896E-4,2.672281489822058E-4,2.670815575212526E-4,2.6713137330118547E-4,2.669060073350436E-4,2.6696067671260957E-4,2.669466478969885E-4,2.670370069169836E-4,2.6708331146775165E-4,2.670290015855951E-4,2.669866770170705E-4,2.669473080355364E-4,2.674942397181303E-4,2.670144796678457E-4,2.669606155255614E-4,2.670130497064105E-4,2.6693330105331505E-4,0.9789024083363865,2.6697494710598214E-4,2.669476827953899E-4,2.6693314868097954E-4,2.671467016031527E-4,2.670394622203582E-4,2.669330370959145E-4,2.669058985915008E-4,2.668790582551076E-4,2.6712035917030377E-4,2.669461139524938E-4,2.6706745772709213E-4,2.6714583525548467E-4,2.670246363885537E-4,2.669609691060531E-4,2.669062484873482E-4,2.669745280371459E-4,2.6690610472833703E-4,2.669201115290604E-4,2.6690625604146025E-4,2.670795154991823E-4,2.6700002408825313E-4,2.6693339338281126E-4,2.669592508861754E-4]}}

{"value":"This movie was horrible.<br /><br />They didn't develop any of the characters at all and the storyline was played out horribly. It was a definite sleeper. You'd expect the action scenes on a movie like this to be its strong points but D-Wars surprises you with even a let down in that department. <br /><br />Also, the acting was just a step above the level of a low budget porno flick. And I seriously mean that.<br /><br />I was actually happy to see the end credits on this one cause it was just that bad!!! Please, whatever you do people, don't waste your time and money on a crappy movie like D-Wars.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","horriblebr","br","thei","do","not","develop","ani","of","the","charact","at","all","and","the","storylin","be","plai","out","horribli","it","be","a","definit","sleeper","you","have","expect","the","action","scene","on","a","movi","like","thi","to","be","it","strong","point","but","dwar","surpris","you","with","even","a","let","down","in","that","depart","br","br","conjur","the","act","be","just","a","step","abov","the","level","of","a","low","budget","porno","flick","and","i","serious","mean","thatbr","br","i","be","actual","happi","to","see","the","end","credit","on","thi","on","caus","it","be","just","that","bad","pleas","whatev","you","do","peopl","do","not","wast","your","time","and","monei","on","a","crappi","movi","like","dwar"],"filtered":["thi","movi","horriblebr","br","thei","develop","ani","charact","storylin","plai","horribli","definit","sleeper","expect","action","scene","movi","like","thi","strong","point","dwar","surpris","even","let","depart","br","br","conjur","act","step","abov","level","low","budget","porno","flick","serious","mean","thatbr","br","actual","happi","see","end","credit","thi","caus","bad","pleas","whatev","peopl","wast","time","monei","crappi","movi","like","dwar"],"filtered2":["horriblebr","develop","ani","charact","storylin","plai","horribli","definit","sleeper","expect","action","scene","like","strong","point","dwar","surpris","even","let","depart","conjur","act","step","abov","level","low","budget","porno","flick","serious","mean","thatbr","actual","happi","see","end","credit","caus","bad","pleas","whatev","peopl","wast","time","monei","crappi","like","dwar"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,8,9,10,19,21,23,24,27,39,40,52,66,88,89,124,126,129,130,217,256,257,320,326,346,356,371,392,445,452,515,557,605,631,704,1060,1077,1276,1600,1740,2313,6097,8620],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,8,9,10,19,21,23,24,27,39,40,52,66,88,89,124,126,129,130,217,256,257,320,326,346,356,371,392,445,452,515,557,605,631,704,1060,1077,1276,1600,1740,2313,6097,8620],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.7122153074726136,1.929723173391612,2.0317223413467334,1.9940046109572438,2.2323930368088845,2.2391270689902285,2.4106958340079214,2.2642139034199635,2.6113665294700725,2.748952192422636,2.7602659523229094,2.938298364153555,2.942840385588056,3.023389038124396,3.028335462059722,3.0466846007279185,3.0670934723591254,3.241201430615691,3.2872346624216657,3.3956930001684253,3.4471119148061256,3.5474598886404074,3.607563812710113,3.5900195030592035,4.160564361526816,4.235066888824737,4.297765483040301,4.558366596889411,4.733083554298147,5.214056214914456,6.437831646536572,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6148425534859343E-4,2.612525409305091E-4,2.6131704620099323E-4,2.612645131159257E-4,2.6128923870304404E-4,2.612511004628137E-4,2.6133235318208825E-4,2.612122305600346E-4,2.612525961435629E-4,2.6152257239224746E-4,2.6359767788534363E-4,2.612530276652937E-4,2.615004507919946E-4,2.6152769462736627E-4,2.6140888942435527E-4,2.612655421990288E-4,2.613554276499346E-4,2.614784224027243E-4,2.6127903021247635E-4,2.612780749504187E-4,2.6151313429716454E-4,2.613042523460797E-4,2.6130464780742025E-4,2.6147204236255065E-4,2.612791244624016E-4,2.615308205288301E-4,2.6134450855169793E-4,2.612519554093561E-4,2.6137039588135556E-4,2.614501698937486E-4,2.6130553408572864E-4,2.614454836394504E-4,2.615738468449779E-4,2.618166279341435E-4,2.613440569410397E-4,2.6126538373733574E-4,2.6135958466286946E-4,2.612919176768645E-4,2.6121250935567063E-4,2.612789492986126E-4,2.615407954557389E-4,2.6139732386619733E-4,2.6144607942866154E-4,2.6122550987310437E-4,2.6127901573523045E-4,2.612652854915761E-4,2.6135372142190803E-4,2.6139904048386766E-4,2.6134588646609515E-4,2.613044626813576E-4,2.612659315805513E-4,2.618012230454302E-4,2.6133167361488843E-4,2.612789558504118E-4,2.613302740869845E-4,2.612522227056216E-4,0.979351423393872,2.612929824151942E-4,2.6126629836447946E-4,2.6125207357619045E-4,2.614610815020014E-4,2.6135612446964127E-4,2.61251964365964E-4,2.612254034439246E-4,2.6119913434406624E-4,2.614352997089239E-4,2.612647629108959E-4,2.613835241546231E-4,2.61460233592606E-4,2.613416141725105E-4,2.612793019057335E-4,2.6122574589302136E-4,2.6129257226530095E-4,2.612256051935993E-4,2.612393138908938E-4,2.6122575328636104E-4,2.613953253040001E-4,2.613175256899793E-4,2.612523130700909E-4,2.6127762025432324E-4]}}

If I ever thought that Harry Potter was butchered, then Michael O'Hara has proved me wrong. <br /><br />I can only pray that the next screenwriter who tackles this fabulous book will do it a great deal more justice.

chops.","finished_norm":["john","heder","be","absolut","horrend","in","thi","movi","i","feel","like","i","be","watch","a","bad","colleg","kid","act","for","the","time","in","a","student","film","anna","farri","be","par","for","the","cours","not","good","but","not","horribl","plu","she","cute","diann","keaton","should","have","know","well","jeff","daniel","be","the","onli","save","grace","in","thi","movi","even","though","it","be","poor","judgem","on","hi","part","a","good","br","br","all","in","all","i","would","avoid","thi","at","all","cost","i","be","just","glad","i","do","not","pai","to","see","it","br","br","john","heder","will","forev","be","stick","in","the","typecast","role","of","the","dorki","kid","unless","he","doe","some","seriou","work","on","hi","act","chop"],"filtered":["john","heder","absolut","horrend","thi","movi","feel","like","watch","bad","colleg","kid","act","time","student","film","anna","farri","par","cours","good","horribl","plu","cute","diann","keaton","know","well","jeff","daniel","onli","save","grace","thi","movi","even","though","poor","judgem","hi","part","good","br","br","avoid","thi","cost","glad","pai","see","br","br","john","heder","forev","stick","typecast","role","dorki","kid","unless","doe","seriou","work","hi","act","chop"],"filtered2":["john","heder","absolut","horrend","feel","like","watch","bad","colleg","kid","act","time","student","anna","farri","par","cours","good","horribl","plu","cute","diann","keaton","know","well","jeff","daniel","onli","save","grace","even","though","poor","judgem","part","good","avoid","cost","glad","pai","see","john","heder","forev","stick","typecast","role","dorki","kid","unless","doe","seriou","work","act","chop"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,8,9,11,18,20,21,26,43,48,61,86,114,128,146,189,199,222,230,291,322,335,416,460,493,626,749,814,836,855,1149,1227,1274,1324,1681,1856,1869,1873,2134,2135,5906,6198,8313],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,8,9,11,18,20,21,26,43,48,61,86,114,128,146,189,199,222,230,291,322,335,416,460,493,626,749,814,836,855,1149,1227,1274,1324,1681,1856,1869,1873,2134,2135,5906,6198,8313],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,2.324031090670098,1.3324924169710188,1.6608112036218214,1.6955116224012472,1.8818517047392527,2.031112399272319,4.886614839193365,2.3409902041158843,2.326138445979858,2.498193474075453,2.558331832813986,2.5771019354959765,2.7121382192999195,6.033663275156474,2.885344817328191,2.908534262247101,3.1401446412440817,3.216957819005698,3.342254038012865,3.6528204042982337,3.7165362186843414,3.9363956947973615,3.7881170224473255,3.9201351739255808,4.297765483040301,4.246178114249808,5.243909178064138,4.364659717870332,4.662879295624898,4.8184434032493035,4.979216623837056,5.00274712124725,5.541743621979936,4.956227105612356,6.389041482367141,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918338E-4,2.3612552253122053E-4,2.3618382374676023E-4,2.3613634324334552E-4,2.3615869074724885E-4,2.3612422060632416E-4,2.36197658517119E-4,2.360890891734517E-4,2.3612557243393584E-4,2.3636958262639025E-4,2.382451064667309E-4,2.3612596245232108E-4,2.3634958866039732E-4,2.3637421220985627E-4,2.3626683357713376E-4,2.3613727335022438E-4,2.3621851370481575E-4,2.3632967894044414E-4,2.3614946409949663E-4,2.361486007136259E-4,2.3636105227822516E-4,2.361722603925211E-4,2.3617261781876985E-4,2.3632391252640506E-4,2.361495492845546E-4,2.3637703746512043E-4,2.362086447949574E-4,2.361249933249295E-4,2.3623204230611872E-4,2.3630414373063932E-4,2.3617341885568197E-4,2.3629990819577738E-4,2.3641592555151682E-4,2.3663535618876822E-4,2.3620823661977844E-4,2.3613713012922476E-4,2.362222709002402E-4,2.3616111205994097E-4,2.3608934115479136E-4,2.361493909678505E-4,2.3638605301314216E-4,2.3625638038324837E-4,2.3630044668255463E-4,2.3610109129494798E-4,2.3614945101465832E-4,2.3613704133264787E-4,2.362169715801616E-4,2.3625793189828033E-4,2.362098901828717E-4,2.3617245049795403E-4,2.3613762528140614E-4,2.3662143292745176E-4,2.3619704431003963E-4,2.3614939688950396E-4,2.3619577938738495E-4,2.3612523491289692E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276104E-4,2.3613795678840846E-4,2.3612510012659122E-4,2.3631400587089324E-4,2.3621914350507246E-4,2.3612500142009942E-4,2.361009951020245E-4,2.3607725253895357E-4,2.3629070374590514E-4,2.3613656901327543E-4,2.3624390791467584E-4,2.3631323951260892E-4,2.3620602879437957E-4,2.3614970966155728E-4,2.3610130461469613E-4,2.3616170369069047E-4,2.3610117744760927E-4,2.361135676555681E-4,2.3610131129695152E-4,2.3625457404084319E-4,2.3618425711895624E-4,2.3612531658619843E-4,2.

{"value":"This movie could have been very good, but comes up way short. Cheesy special effects and so-so acting. I could have looked past that if the story wasn't so lousy. If there was more of a background story, it would have been better. The plot centers around an evil Druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. The movie drags on and on and never clearly explains anything, it just keeps plodding on. Christopher Walken has a part, but it is completely senseless, as is most of the movie. This movie had potential, but it looks like some really bad made for TV movie. I would avoid this movie.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","can","have","be","veri","good","but","come","up","wai","short","cheesi","special","effect","and","soso","act","i","can","have","look","past","that","if","the","stori","be","not","so","lousi","if","there","be","much","of","a","background","stori","it","would","have","be","well","the","plot","center","around","a","evil","druid","witch","who","be","link","to","thi","woman","who","get","migrain","the","movi","drag","on","and","on","and","never","clearli","explain","anyth","it","just","keep","plod","on","christoph","walken","have","a","part","but","it","be","complet","senseless","a","be","much","of","the","movi","thi","movi","have","potenti","but","it","look","like","some","realli","bad","make","for","tv","movi","i","would","avoid","thi","movi"],"filtered":["thi","movi","veri","good","come","wai","short","cheesi","special","effect","soso","act","look","past","stori","lousi","much","background","stori","well","plot","center","around","evil","druid","witch","link","thi","woman","get","migrain","movi","drag","never","clearli","explain","anyth","keep","plod","christoph","walken","part","complet","senseless","much","movi","thi","movi","potenti","look","like","realli","bad","make","tv","movi","avoid","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["veri","good","come","wai","short","cheesi","special","effect","soso","act","look","past","stori","lousi","background","stori","well","plot","center","around","evil","druid","witch","link","woman","get","migrain","drag","never","clearli","explain","anyth","keep","plod","christoph","walken","part","complet","senseless","potenti","look","like","realli","bad","make","tv","avoid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,9,13,15,16,17,20,21,32,33,34,42,61,70,98,103,104,106,134,172,203,272,321,335,395,440,494,543,547,764,801,1116,1135,1162,1314,2250,2320,2397,2440,3656,8589],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,9,13,15,16,17,20,21,32,33,34,42,61,70,98,103,104,106,134,172,203,272,321,335,395,440,494,543,547,764,801,1116,1135,1162,1314,2250,2320,2397,2440,3656,8589],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,2.5541073880211935,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.6219954307453837,1.8818517047392527,2.094675786251684,2.0881990796736947,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.159084361316692,2.2443961816702407,2.5001408943598484,2.569760528637609,2.8028805344481915,3.09496984188738,2.908534262247101,3.153168081130368,3.212973749990824,3.3243163373261977,3.477726550625732,3.432149042129413,3.7465885637507435,3.7881170224473255,4.224077767249142,4.4919214974812585,4.383707912841026,4.4637506205145625,5.051537285416681,5.521540914662417,5.129498826886393,5.102830579804232,5.695894301807195,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.614842553485934E-4,2.612525409305091E-4,2.6131704620099323E-4,2.612645131159257E-4,2.61289238703044E-4,2.612511004628137E-4,2.613323531820882E-4,2.6121223056003453E-4,2.6125259614356286E-4,2.6152257239224746E-4,2.6359767788534363E-4,2.6125302766529364E-4,2.6150045079199457E-4,2.615276946273662E-4,2.614088894243552E-4,2.612655421990288E-4,2.6135542764993457E-4,2.6147842240272423E-4,2.6127903021247635E-4,2.6127807495041863E-4,2.615131342971645E-4,2.6130425234607965E-4,2.6130464780742025E-4,2.614720423625506E-4,2.612791244624016E-4,2.6153082052883005E-4,2.613445085516979E-4,2.6125195540935606E-4,2.613703958813555E-4,2.614501698937485E-4,2.613055340857286E-4,2.6144548363945033E-4,2.6157384684497785E-4,2.6181662793414343E-4,2.6134405694103966E-4,2.612653837373357E-4,2.613595846628694E-4,2.6129191767686443E-4,2.6121250935567063E-4,2.612789492986125E-4,2.615407954557389E-4,2.6139732386619733E-4,2.614460794286615E-4,2.612255098731043E-4,2.6127901573523045E-4,2.6126528549157607E-4,2.61353721421908E-4,2.613990404838676E-4,2.613458864660951E-4,2.6130446268135755E-4,2.6126593158055125E-4,2.6180122304543014E-4,2.6133167361488843E-4,2.612789558504117E-4,2.6133027408698444E-4,2.6125222270562153E-4,0.979351423393872,2.6129298241519416E-4,2.612662983644794E-4,2.612520735761904E-4,2.614610815020013E-4,2.613561244696412E-4,2.612519643659639E-4,2.6122540344392456E-4,2.611991343440662E-4,2.614352997089238E-4,2.6126476291089585E-4,2.6138352415462304E-4,2.6146023359260596E-4,2.6134161417251043E-4,2.6127930190573344E-4,2.612257458930213E-4,2.612925722653009E-4,2.6122560519359925E-4,2.6123931389089377E-4,2.6122575328636104E-4,2.6139532530400003E-4,2.6131752568997924E-4,2.6125231307009086E-4,2.612776202543232E-4]}}
