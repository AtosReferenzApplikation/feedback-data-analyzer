{"value":"Screenwriter Lisa Lutz began writing the screenplay at the age of 21 in 1991 <br /><br />Is she even in business? If someone gave her another chance after this piece of crap, she's up for the most Fortunate Person Of Ever award.This movie sucks to no END...It never ceases to amaze me what the turn into movies...and the fact that they made this writer put it off for a bit? Seriously? I can write better crap than this in my sleep.<br /><br />OK, so how many lines to I have to type? I don't get this at all. I guess I\"m a newbie. I guess I don't understand why there should ever be a limit to what anyone has to say...or a quota? Seriously, I don't care if you have a one word sentence...or even a one word response.

{"value":"I must say this movie is a Mork and Mindy knock off, when watching it i got the chills, I even wet myself a little. When that Korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord Asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time. Any way back on track Chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being. Some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of Christmas past. This movie is so bad I put my new born child in a box and left it in Mr. Norris mailbox.

{"value":"A reasonable effort is summary for this film. A good sixties film but lacking any sense of achievement. Maggie Smith gave a decent performance which was believable enough but not as good as she could have given, other actors were just dreadful! A terrible portrayal. It wasn't very funny and so it didn't really achieve its genres as it wasn't particularly funny and it wasn't dramatic. The only genre achieved to a satisfactory level was romance. Target Audiences were not hit and the movie sent out confusing messages. A very basic plot and a very basic storyline were not pulled off or performed at all well and people were left confused as to why the film wasn't as good and who the target audiences were etc. However Maggie was quite good and the storyline was alright with moments of capability.<br /><br

{"value":"Well I must say this is probably the worst film I have seen this year! The jokes were extremely crude (wasn't expecting it from as PG movie)(Rated PG in Canada) and they weren't funny! With this great cast I at least expected some good acting but I didn't even get that. I am a huge Rainn Wilson fan and this is the first time I was extremely disappointed by his performance. Neither Luke Wilosn or Uma Thurman's characters are the least bit likable and i really could have cared less what happened to either of them. I didn't expect this at all as in the past I have really liked other movies by this director (Six Days, Seven Nights for example) This movie was NOT worth the $10 it cost me and i strongly encourage you not to see this movie. I guarantee that you will be like me begging for this movie to be over.","finished_norm":["good","i","must","sai","thi","be","probabl","the","wrong","film","i","have","see","thi","year","the","joke","be","extrem","crude","be","not","expect","it","from","a","pg","movier","pg","in","canada","and","thei","be","not","funni","with","thi","great","cast","i","at","littl","expect","some","good","act","but","i","do","not","even","get","that","i","be","a","huge","rainn","wilson","fan","and","thi","be","the","time","i","be","extrem","disappoint","by","hi","perform","neither","luke","wilosn","or","uma","thurman","charact","be","the","littl","bite","likabl","and","i","realli","can","have","care","littl","what","happen","to","either","of","them","i","do","not","expect","thi","at","all","a","in","the","past","i","have","realli","like","other","movi","by","thi","director","six","dai","seven","night","for","exampl","thi","movi","be","not","worth","the","it","cost","me","and","i","strongli","encourag","you","not","to","see","thi","movi","i","guarante","that","you","will","be","like","me","beg","for","thi","movi","to","be","over"],"filtered":["good","must","sai","thi","probabl","wrong","film","see","thi","year","joke","extrem","crude","expect","pg","movier","pg","canada","thei","funni","thi","great","cast","littl","expect","good","act","even","get","huge","rainn","wilson","fan","thi","time","extrem","disappoint","hi","perform","neither","luke","wilosn","uma","thurman","charact","littl","bite","likabl","realli","care","littl","happen","either","expect","thi","past","realli","like","movi","thi","director","six","dai","seven","night","exampl","thi","movi","worth","cost","strongli","encourag","see","thi","movi","guarante","like","beg","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["good","must","probabl","wrong","see","year","joke","extrem","crude","expect","pg","movier","pg","canada","funni","great","cast","littl","expect","good","act","even","get","huge","rainn","wilson","fan","time","extrem","disappoint","perform","neither","luke","wilosn","uma","thurman","charact","littl","bite","likabl","realli","care","littl","happen","either","expect","past","realli","like","director","six","dai","seven","night","exampl","worth","cost","strongli","encourag","see","guarante","like","beg"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,8,10,13,14,21,25,51,57,58,62,92,94,105,130,132,140,141,148,154,187,205,207,210,214,219,307,329,440,444,718,836,1348,1439,1509,1793,1966,2019,2140,2217,2257,2321,2467,2692,3468,4366],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,8,10,13,14,21,25,51,57,58,62,92,94,105,130,132,140,141,148,154,187,205,207,210,214,219,307,329,440,444,718,836,1348,1439,1509,1793,1966,2019,2140,2217,2257,2321,2467,2692,3468,4366],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.2635883139467947,3.3525245991777624,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.7139899308309823,1.834162586674748,1.865701314626681,2.0226120445069267,2.0489535369135887,2.08112281984698,2.1765612129984904,6.792641710259891,2.253494045787767,2.317169775997098,2.2657547357741192,2.3018654096236517,2.348499626138016,2.4732161909892554,2.571852579609833,2.5531798379045583,2.687151791517189,2.7303758068497004,2.5792094178355414,2.8767855639325206,5.903973581628264,3.212973749990824,3.2535472664379905,3.634471265630037,3.7881170224473255,4.470719289830655,4.513582994262438,4.751432692966343,4.869215728622727,4.85885294158718,10.153710186801943,5.373120909544144,5.00274712124725,5.064116067623542,5.444579873526289,5.185068678041204,5.426230734858092,6.1754673820690815,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875923E-4,2.0127954981638405E-4,2.0132924729208165E-4,2.0128877367343206E-4,2.0130782326822794E-4,2.0127844002166886E-4,2.01341040410927E-4,2.0124849307261747E-4,2.0127959235475927E-4,2.014875930027254E-4,2.0308633840816437E-4,2.0127992481659636E-4,2.014705496249873E-4,2.01491539380338E-4,2.0140000703507265E-4,2.0128956652077805E-4,2.0135881791649243E-4,2.0145357806076932E-4,2.0129995823319922E-4,2.012992222605796E-4,2.014803215116132E-4,2.0131939038753923E-4,2.0131969506698968E-4,2.0144866261914574E-4,2.0130003084716292E-4,2.0149394770156302E-4,2.0135040540050444E-4,2.0127909870714829E-4,2.0137035004885455E-4,2.0143181118237818E-4,2.0132037789173193E-4,2.0142820070206626E-4,2.015270969199922E-4,2.0171414531445809E-4,2.0135005746134315E-4,2.0128944443546502E-4,2.0136202064780032E-4,2.0130988725827615E-4,2.0124870786807905E-4,2.0129989589387793E-4,2.0150163278967933E-4,2.0139109646015116E-4,2.0142865972223037E-4,2.0125872399380596E-4,2.01299947079342E-4,2.012893687429485E-4,2.0135750336924306E-4,2.013924190120033E-4,2.0135146700162254E-4,2.0131955243836522E-4,2.0128986651609017E-4,2.0170227676361398E-4

But I have to say that it is a very usual and uninteresting giallo. Yes, great cinematography, the film is well directed, but it never freaked me out. It starts well, but although it not bored me at all, the story is so ordinary and the things that occur so normal, that I didn't like it very much.<br /><br />You can make a few laughs. And you can see some little tits. But if you like the kind of giallos I like (bizarre, surreal, nonsenseful, gory, atmospheric, brutal murders...) you won't appreciate much this film.<br /><br />I give it a 4 for the good directing and editing, and the final twists, that make the film entertaining. But it could be much better.","finished_norm":["i","get","thi","film","from","a","privat","collector","and","be","veri","curiou","about","it","it","have","a","in","imdb","vote","onli","and","some","extern","comment","be","pleasant","but","i","have","to","sai","that","it","be","a","veri","usual","and","uninterest","giallo","ye","great","cinematographi","the","film","be","good","direct","but","it","never","freak","me","out","it","start","good","but","although","it","not","bore","me","at","all","the","stori","be","so","ordinari","and","the","thing","that","occur","so","normal","that","i","do","not","like","it","veri","muchbr","br","you","can","make","a","few","laugh","and","you","can","see","some","littl","tit","but","if","you","like","the","kind","of","giallo","i","like","bizarr","surreal","nonsens","gori","atmospher","brutal","murder","you","wo","not","appreci","much","thi","filmbr","br","i","give","it","a","for","the","good","direct","and","edit","and","the","final","twist","that","make","the","film","entertain","but","it","can","be","much","well"],"filtered":["get","thi","film","privat","collector","veri","curiou","imdb","vote","onli","extern","comment","pleasant","sai","veri","usual","uninterest","giallo","ye","great","cinematographi","film","good","direct","never","freak","start","good","although","bore","stori","ordinari","thing","occur","normal","like","veri","muchbr","br","make","laugh","see","littl","tit","like","kind","giallo","like","bizarr","surreal","nonsens","gori","atmospher","brutal","murder","wo","appreci","much","thi","filmbr","br","give","good","direct","edit","final","twist","make","film","entertain","much","well"],"filtered2":["get","privat","collector","veri","curiou","imdb","vote","onli","extern","comment","pleasant","veri","usual","uninterest","giallo","ye","great","cinematographi","good","direct","never","freak","start","good","although","bore","stori","ordinari","thing","occur","normal","like","veri","muchbr","make","laugh","see","littl","tit","like","kind","giallo","like","bizarr","surreal","nonsens","gori","atmospher","brutal","murder","wo","appreci","filmbr","give","good","direct","edit","final","twist","make","entertain","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,11,14,15,17,20,29,30,42,51,71,102,108,122,133,156,195,209,237,265,273,280,348,406,435,566,591,629,700,823,835,905,961,1189,1191,1247,1259,1313,1487,1596,1689,1957,2311,2497,3095,4307,4742,5165],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,11,14,15,17,20,29,30,42,51,71,102,108,122,133,156,195,209,237,265,273,280,348,406,435,566,591,629,700,823,835,905,961,1189,1191,1247,1259,1313,1487,1596,1689,1957,2311,2497,3095,4307,4742,5165],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,3.6001823395697077,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.6219954307453837,1.7139899308309823,1.9214926742550966,4.175107420354542,2.138507503627933,2.2489347673732487,2.3212364753796515,2.3451551414151686,2.51289241584188,2.6026896854443837,2.640097787510554,2.73529586597515,2.9674191958529437,2.8028805344481915,3.0103169565570433,3.121829110937649,3.2829611516442836,3.439602492783994,3.509308122676031,3.488143311483988,3.616452760127359,3.850067611308864,3.8614098879127985,3.9121030022283168,3.9954846111673676,4.291900363587903,4.3215761317340196,4.327618446189983,4.315570107673808,4.409683399244287,4.581533656170946,4.613282354485526,4.74221603786142,4.911775343041523,5.0768550934009715,5.274680836730892,5.463272006538442,6.032366538428407,6.1754673820690815,12.778082964734281]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079205E-4,1.9803239209117203E-4,1.9808128781854356E-4,1.9804146714364105E-4,1.9806020941939254E-4,1.9803130020030492E-4,1.9809289068399759E-4,1.9800183637269853E-4,1.9803243394329366E-4,1.9823707900490484E-4,1.998100325282864E-4,1.9803276104166475E-4,1.9822031058076107E-4,1.982409617172789E-4,1.981509060245712E-4,1.980422472003166E-4,1.981103813925954E-4,1.982036128116003E-4,1.980524712676427E-4,1.9805174716815762E-4,1.9822992482167892E-4,1.9807158993126724E-4,1.9807188969545316E-4,1.981987766687145E-4,1.9805254271015608E-4,1.9824333118607766E-4,1.9810210459216468E-4,1.980319482594905E-4,1.9812172748195052E-4,1.981821970890389E-4,1.9807256150447306E-4,1.9817864485507662E-4,1.9827594562220625E-4,1.984599764441486E-4,1.9810176226615854E-4,1.9804212708455425E-4,1.981135324555956E-4,1.980622401119635E-4,1.9800204770295592E-4,1.9805240993401527E-4,1.982508922939224E-4,1.9814213920018082E-4,1.9817909647006286E-4,1.980119022427688E-4,1.9805246029372593E-4,1.98042052613153E-4,1.9810908805238E-4,1.9814344041586411E-4,1.981031490669216E-4,1.980717493677959E-4,1.9804254235593

{"value":"William Russ is the main character throughout this made for TV movie. He left his family behind to only reappear and begin paying off his debts. But he tries to keep away from his family. Thats where Peter Falk (Colombo) comes in, playing several different roles, to convince him to come home.<br /><br />The story is average and they actually managed to get a former star (Peter Falk) and use him to a fairly nice degree. But William Russ wasn't truly a star. However, it appears his acting is still OK.<br /><br />I found the delivery and story very cheesy in how everything was predictable. In fact, the last 20 minutes I could almost dictate word for word before it happened. A good movie should never be like that.<br /><br />Overall, it was a sub-par movie.

{"value":"Poorly structured, badly written, loaded with cliches and flat dialogue. Not a single scene shines. The actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises, plot twists or conflict. You know from the first ten minutes where it's going.<br /><br />For a movie set in NY, it has almost no feeling for the city. There are a dozen other indie movies that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget. This one seems like it was shot in Toronto.<br /><br />If you cast Natasha Henstridge, why dress her in baggy sweaters? Why make Vartan look boring and drab? Where's the attraction? I felt like I was watching a sub-par Christian movie of the week it was so asexual and moralizing.<br /><br />Steven Feder's big success is that he convinced people to make this bland

{"value":"Just a dumb old movie. First Stanwyck's son gets his foot trapped in a really dumb way, and then her husband gets his foot trapped in another really dumb way. In an effort to save him, Stanwyck gets unlucky, yet again, and comes across an escaped convict. She has a chance to kill him but fails in a very dumb way. In the end her husband is saved, and Stanwyck tells us through narration what the dumb message of the movie is. All's well than ends dumb.<br /><br />I could never figure out how an unattractive woman like Stanwyck ever made it as a leading lady in Hollywood's glamour-oriented Golden Era; that nose is so beautiful So photogenic The film is mercifully short, running a little over an hour.

{"value":"foywonder's review of this cheap STV hits the nail squarely on the head. Make sure you read it. In case you don't, a group of scientists heads off into the deep woods of the Pacific Northwest, to fumble around with a bunch of bones in an animal graveyard. The Big Foot family doesn't take kindly to this, and proceeds to pick off the team one by one, largely offscreen. Big Foot himself has a distinctly ape-like face, but is less scary overall than Harry from HARRY AND THE HENDERSONS. Most of the movie has the wooden, generic actors pretending to be scientists tromping around in the woods and yakking away. This is a no-budget movie in which very little happens, at least on screen.

{"value":"My one line summary should explain it all, but I'll have a go at it.<br /><br />From the get-go, this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera, and that's about all I can comment on. There were a few interesting scenes, such as the \"Big one\" that hit during the middle of the movie, but, wait, what's that? The earthquake *gasp*, wait a minute! That's Dante's Peak! Well, parts of it butchered and slapped in. I can't believe how poorly this movie was done, \"borrowing\" scenes from other, much better films. One wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown LA, ala Dante's Peak.<br /><br />My advise, forget the Bond Wanna-be,

{"value":"I may not have the longest of attention-spans, but this is the second movie I have refused to see all the way through, and I even bought it on DVD because of its \"classic\" status. <br /><br />At first, I thought that the director was playing a big joke, so I kept waiting for a resolution, something to laugh at, something to keep my interest, but this resolution never came. Rather, the writing was laughably amateurish, the movie dragged on and felt disjointed, like someone cut a TV series to feature-length. The Academy must have been on drugs when they nominated this movie for no less than eight Oscars.<br /><br />Once again, I repeat myself. This is the second movie I have refused to watch all the way through. The first was \"Exterminator\".

{"value":"wow, the Naked Brothers Band. What should i say. I guess i can say this show just sucks. number one: they have no talent, they probably can't even play the instruments. number 2: on the commercial it said they were famous but nobody even heard of them till there crappy show came on. Look, i really don't hate it that bad, i'd give it like a 4 out of 10, but what annoys me is how everyone says they have such great talent and Nat is SO deep and writes deep lyrics. Deep my ass! he talks about hardcore wrestlers with inner feelings. wow, i could read what it says on the walls of a bathroom and it would be more deep than that. And they didn't get famous by themselves, their parents are famous celebrities and wanted their kids to be too so they made up a bad show. i have a feeling that it will be canceled soon.","finished_norm":["wow","the","nake","brother","band","what","should","i","sai","i","guess","i","can","sai","thi","show","just","suck","numb","on","thei","have","no","talent","thei","probabl","ca","not","even","plai","the","instrum","numb","on","the","commerci","it","sai","thei","be","famou","but","nobodi","even","hear","of","them","till","there","crappi","show","come","on","look","i","realli","do","not","hate","it","that","bad","i","have","give","it","like","a","out","of","but","what","annoi","me","be","how","everyon","sai","thei","have","such","great","talent","and","nat","be","so","deep","and","write","deep","lyric","deep","my","ass","he","talk","about","hardcor","wrestler","with","inner","feel","wow","i","can","read","what","it","sai","on","the","wall","of","a","bathroom","and","it","would","be","much","deep","than","that","and","thei","do","not","get","famou","by","themselv","their","parent","be","famou","celebr","and","want","their","kid","to","be","too","so","thei","make","up","a","bad","show","i","have","a","feel","that","it","will","be","cancel","soon"],"filtered":["wow","nake","brother","band","sai","guess","sai","thi","show","suck","numb","thei","talent","thei","probabl","ca","even","plai","instrum","numb","commerci","sai","thei","famou","nobodi","even","hear","till","crappi","show","come","look","realli","hate","bad","give","like","annoi","everyon","sai","thei","great","talent","nat","deep","write","deep","lyric","deep","ass","talk","hardcor","wrestler","inner","feel","wow","read","sai","wall","bathroom","much","deep","thei","get","famou","themselv","parent","famou","celebr","want","kid","thei","make","bad","show","feel","cancel","soon"],"filtered2":["wow","nake","brother","band","guess","show","suck","numb","talent","probabl","ca","even","plai","instrum","numb","commerci","famou","nobodi","even","hear","till","crappi","show","come","look","realli","hate","bad","give","like","annoi","everyon","great","talent","nat","deep","write","deep","lyric","deep","ass","talk","hardcor","wrestler","inner","feel","wow","read","wall","bathroom","deep","get","famou","themselv","parent","famou","celebr","want","kid","make","bad","show","feel","cancel","soon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,9,13,16,28,30,34,37,40,43,51,65,81,114,145,148,186,216,243,246,271,276,339,381,421,436,449,516,670,834,865,866,893,927,1003,1077,1085,1126,1539,1660,1926,2569,2598,2757,2962,3026,3432,5144],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,9,13,16,28,30,34,37,40,43,51,65,81,114,145,148,186,216,243,246,271,276,339,381,421,436,449,516,670,834,865,866,893,927,1003,1077,1085,1126,1539,1660,1926,2569,2598,2757,2962,3026,3432,5144],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,2.1367141713444147,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,4.635688258055728,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,3.321622407243643,1.7139899308309823,1.9073850067444174,1.949757232424728,2.4433074195966826,2.34599021453259,2.3018654096236517,2.571852579609833,2.6070186965339692,2.627841366673578,2.673149229007135,2.757740698455715,5.576945901169839,3.003844442051426,3.24941502915308,3.2597778161886266,3.2070272508030975,3.2597778161886266,6.884198745965162,3.7264536553416874,15.296368499622414,11.760405521776743,3.8962296530720266,4.017463517886143,4.251780369798478,8.070802437145622,4.235066888824737,4.176068548062782,4.240607069200353,4.662879295624898,4.688631791727313,4.890269137820559,5.2288713006995975,5.1994574154933035,5.3560264761848435,5.463272006538442,5.482320201509136,5.999576715605417,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8905805373476214E-4,1.8889051983545757E-4,1.8893715836394988E-4,1.8889917595156215E-4,1.8891705301789564E-4,1.8888947835011614E-4,1.889482256002946E-4,1.8886137467649918E-4,1.8889055975553794E-4,1.8908575768079302E-4,1.9058610392911002E-4,1.888908717538969E-4,1.8906976334612943E-4,1.8908946115349747E-4,1.8900356274854425E-4,1.888999199980759E-4,1.8896490887621953E-4,1.8905383640476615E-4,1.8890967208646742E-4,1.8890898141396328E-4,1.8907893375984619E-4,1.8892790816528495E-4,1.8892819409130094E-4,1.8904922351525825E-4,1.889097402309429E-4,1.890917212392764E-4,1.889570141620295E-4,1.8889009649260865E-4,1.8897573119015394E-4,1.8903340930733747E-4,1.8892883488725183E-4,1.890300210569981E-4,1.8912283007823663E-4,1.892983653896842E-4,1.889566876389967E-4,1.888998054272799E-4,1.8896791447506052E-4,1.889189899665499E-4,1.8886157625100806E-4,1.8890961358421614E-4,1.8909893329976935E-4,1.8899520063162532E-4,1.8903045182384697E-4,1.8887097587057705E-4,1.8890966161914528E-4,1.888997343937407E-4,1.889636752411408E-4,1.8899644177861264E-4,1.889580104201553E-4,1.8892806024166224E-4,1.8890020152826867E

He doesn't lip sync well and his stage mannerisms are Larenz Tate, when he should have been Frankie Lymon. The portrayal of the women as a bunch of gold diggers has Hollywood written all over it. The powers that be obviously pushed it, but it only made the characters more unrealistic. The positives of the movie were Miguel Nunez's portrayal of Little Richard, and the cameo of Little Richard himself. Lela Rochon is eye candy, as usual, even in a conservative role. It's too bad that the talents of Halle Berry and Vivica A. Fox were wasted. The whole Frankie Lymon saga was fascinating in real life. Too bad this film was a wasted opportunity.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","can","have","be","so","much","well","especi","consid","the","talent","larenz","tate","portray","of","franki","lymon","be","not","good","especi","in","music","perform","he","doe","not","lip","sync","good","and","hi","stage","manner","be","larenz","tate","when","he","should","have","be","franki","lymon","the","portray","of","the","woman","a","a","bunch","of","gold","digger","have","hollywood","write","all","over","it","the","power","that","be","obvious","push","it","but","it","onli","make","the","charact","much","unrealist","the","posit","of","the","movi","be","miguel","nunez","portray","of","littl","richard","and","the","cameo","of","littl","richard","himself","lela","rochon","be","ey","candi","a","usual","even","in","a","conserv","role","it","too","bad","that","the","talent","of","hall","berri","and","vivica","a","fox","be","wast","the","whole","franki","lymon","saga","be","fascin","in","real","life","too","bad","thi","film","be","a","wast","opportun"],"filtered":["thi","movi","much","well","especi","consid","talent","larenz","tate","portray","franki","lymon","good","especi","music","perform","doe","lip","sync","good","hi","stage","manner","larenz","tate","franki","lymon","portray","woman","bunch","gold","digger","hollywood","write","power","obvious","push","onli","make","charact","much","unrealist","posit","movi","miguel","nunez","portray","littl","richard","cameo","littl","richard","lela","rochon","ey","candi","usual","even","conserv","role","bad","talent","hall","berri","vivica","fox","wast","whole","franki","lymon","saga","fascin","real","life","bad","thi","film","wast","opportun"],"filtered2":["well","especi","consid","talent","larenz","tate","portray","franki","lymon","good","especi","music","perform","doe","lip","sync","good","stage","manner","larenz","tate","franki","lymon","portray","woman","bunch","gold","digger","hollywood","write","power","obvious","push","onli","make","charact","unrealist","posit","miguel","nunez","portray","littl","richard","cameo","littl","richard","lela","rochon","ey","candi","usual","even","conserv","role","bad","talent","hall","berri","vivica","fox","wast","whole","franki","lymon","saga","fascin","real","life","bad","wast","opportun"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,9,10,11,14,18,20,65,70,75,80,89,105,111,118,128,265,267,276,281,300,317,341,365,419,509,641,669,993,1046,1199,1256,1257,1264,1422,1611,1787,1800,2423,2474,3437,4172,4192,5266,5825],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,9,10,11,14,18,20,65,70,75,80,89,105,111,118,128,265,267,276,281,300,317,341,365,419,509,641,669,993,1046,1199,1256,1257,1264,1422,1611,1787,1800,2423,2474,3437,4172,4192,5266,5825],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,2.2350163994518417,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.9073850067444174,2.094675786251684,1.9742250248702675,1.9951803900462557,3.9880092219144876,2.1765612129984904,2.1183455303375887,2.354379525480895,2.3409902041158843,2.73529586597515,5.417060555847441,5.576945901169839,2.832333801361687,2.932274249550174,2.8529247828056143,2.933776879434709,3.185521045582134,3.1758963322079246,3.360519385990158,7.4069282742339775,3.7099788181381825,4.026392148630444,4.067587905068712,4.291900363587903,4.3215761317340196,4.34596758485818,4.327618446189983,13.454412089137184,5.064116067623542,4.828393734102471,4.933754249760298,5.185068678041204,5.1994574154933035,5.850044981634453,19.167124447101422,5.9370563586240825,6.868614562629026,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852442E-4,2.0810416094933746E-4,2.0815554347424268E-4,2.0811369755170686E-4,2.0813339304459242E-4,2.0810301352577532E-4,2.0816773645214096E-4,2.0807205119149439E-4,2.0810420493002447E-4,2.0831925807556954E-4,2.099722107549351E-4,2.0810454866435673E-4,2.083016368228036E-4,2.0832333825958528E-4,2.0822870240647183E-4,2.0811451728144022E-4,2.081861167241698E-4,2.0828408981847654E-4,2.0812526133664205E-4,2.0812450041003713E-4,2.0831174003631451E-4,2.0814535236018646E-4,2.081456673701388E-4,2.082790077132368E-4,2.0812533641266447E-4,2.0832582823766946E-4,2.0817741897229805E-4,2.0810369454473207E-4,2.0819803986654248E-4,2.0826158490941743E-4,2.081463733468274E-4,2.0825785201168082E-4,2.0836010141789873E-4,2.085534919000553E-4,2.0817705923586538E-4,2.0811439105668635E-4,2.081894280477105E-4,2.081355270165612E-4,2.080722732698394E-4,2.0812519688363548E-4,2.0833377389740352E-4,2.0821948970841427E-4,2.0825832659544354E-4,2.0808262900365472E-4,2.0812524980460067E-4,2.081143127977293E-4,2.0818475760570689E-4,2.0822085710288507E-4,2.0817851656820458E-4,2.0814551990552927E-4,2.081148274484332E-4,2.085412209325509E-4,2.0816719513391523E-4,2.081252021

{"value":"One star for the \"plot\". One star for the acting. One star for the dubbing into squeaky-voiced American. Five stars for Monica Broeke and Inge Maria Granzow, with their propensity for taking all their clothes off. And ten out of ten for the divine Emmanuelle Béart, two years before she made 'Manon des sources'. Béart also undresses a couple of times, but even fully-clothed her presence is enough to make this film eminently watchable. Watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three \"first times\" for a girl. It's corny, but still far more erotic than the rather laughably choreographed \"love scenes\" featuring Broeke, Granzow and Patrick Bauchau. Incidentally, the cinematography is not great; the stills for the closing credits are a better indication of what David Hamilton is capable of.","finished_norm":["on","star","for","the","plot","on","star","for","the","act","on","star","for","the","dub","into","squeakyvo","american","five","star","for","monica","broek","and","ing","mare","granzow","with","their","propens","for","take","all","their","cloth","off","and","ten","out","of","ten","for","the","divin","emmanuel","béart","two","year","befor","she","make","manon","de","sourc","béart","conjur","undress","a","coupl","of","time","but","even","fullycloth","her","presenc","be","enough","to","make","thi","film","emin","watchabl","watch","out","for","the","scene","where","she","tell","her","friend","about","the","three","time","for","a","girl","it","corni","but","still","far","much","erot","than","the","rather","laughabl","choreograph","love","scene","featur","broek","granzow","and","patrick","bauchau","incident","the","cinematographi","be","not","great","the","still","for","the","close","credit","be","a","well","indic","of","what","david","hamilton","be","capabl","of"],"filtered":["star","plot","star","act","star","dub","squeakyvo","american","five","star","monica","broek","ing","mare","granzow","propens","take","cloth","ten","ten","divin","emmanuel","béart","two","year","befor","make","manon","de","sourc","béart","conjur","undress","coupl","time","even","fullycloth","presenc","enough","make","thi","film","emin","watchabl","watch","scene","tell","friend","three","time","girl","corni","still","far","much","erot","rather","laughabl","choreograph","love","scene","featur","broek","granzow","patrick","bauchau","incident","cinematographi","great","still","close","credit","well","indic","david","hamilton","capabl"],"filtered2":["star","plot","star","act","star","dub","squeakyvo","american","five","star","monica","broek","ing","mare","granzow","propens","take","cloth","ten","ten","divin","emmanuel","béart","two","year","befor","make","manon","de","sourc","béart","conjur","undress","coupl","time","even","fullycloth","presenc","enough","make","emin","watchabl","watch","scene","tell","friend","three","time","girl","corni","still","far","erot","rather","laughabl","choreograph","love","scene","featur","broek","granzow","patrick","bauchau","incident","cinematographi","great","still","close","credit","well","indic","david","hamilton","capabl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,7,8,19,20,21,31,32,39,47,51,54,57,64,79,84,90,93,100,101,160,161,223,224,253,295,305,356,504,545,552,629,675,750,879,949,1159,1178,1419,1485,1536,1588,2199,2506,2753,3050,3185,3219,5501,6192,6673,7664,7770],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,7,8,19,20,21,31,32,39,47,51,54,57,64,79,84,90,93,100,101,160,161,223,224,253,295,305,356,504,545,552,629,675,750,879,949,1159,1178,1419,1485,1536,1588,2199,2506,2753,3050,3185,3219,5501,6192,6673,7664,7770],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,3.766857155204268,1.9469506069506084,2.2212694515902225,2.0477128419653545,2.035389827120098,8.562184961271125,2.098582041218749,2.3722295531801256,2.4323182980210873,2.825563294794476,2.689504733779216,2.7073305177318163,2.7910771187233068,2.8612813773965557,3.028335462059722,3.3956930001684253,6.884198745965162,3.424750734647968,3.488143311483988,3.749984152751882,4.030886538218284,3.8962296530720266,4.086456389373095,4.224077767249142,4.229557233013768,4.436351646326448,4.566029469634981,4.5432147918688095,4.654440426979034,5.089758498236879,5.339219357868463,5.695894301807195,5.907203395474402,5.501738287366237,5.501738287366237,6.342521466732247,6.660975197850782,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.950611946162387E-4,1.9488834103030834E-4,1.9493646046718572E-4,1.948972720031748E-4,1.9491571671815183E-4,1.9488726647479027E-4,1.9494787912034467E-4,1.9485827042812348E-4,1.948883822179669E-4,1.950897782428106E-4,1.9663775885027946E-4,1.9488870412317756E-4,1.9507327604168802E-4,1.9509359931150187E-4,1.9500497338335542E-4,1.948980396753208E-4,1.949650921386094E-4,1.9505684337379827E-4,1.949081014207692E-4,1.9490738881741226E-4,1.9508273764260573E-4,1.9492691654791663E-4,1.9492721155291192E-4,1.950520840116856E-4,1.949081717290292E-4,1.9509593116155143E-4,1.9495694674437393E-4,1.948879042450976E-4,1.94976258092362E-4,1.9503576765685172E-4,1.9492787269599054E-4,1.950322718197488E-4,1.951280277962667E-4,1.953091368623546E-4,1.9495660985328894E-4,1.9489792146657012E-4,1.949681931739204E-4,1.949177151705369E-4,1.9485847840320693E-4,1.9490804106090198E-4,1.951033722258574E-4,1.949963457450004E-4,1.9503271626469297E-4,1.94868

{"value":"Cynthia Rothrock,(China O'Brien),\"Manhattan Chase\",2000, made this film enjoyable to watch and of course,e this cute petite gal burned up the screen with her artistic abilities and hot sexy body. China O'Brien gets upset as a police officer and decides to call it quits and go back home to her hometown and get back to her roots and her dad, who is the local sheriff. Her dad is getting older and the town has changed, gangsters have taken over the town and started to get the local women to start turning tricks and the city people were getting sick and tired of their town going to Hell. Well, you almost can guess what happens, and you are right, China O'Brien fights back after great tragedy strikes her life.

{"value":"I'm going to spend as much time on this review as the writers did on the script. This is easily THE WORST sequel EVER made.<br /><br />They KILLED Navin Johnson. Not only was Mark Blankfield's performance GOD-AWFUL, so was everyone elses!! The physical comedy was forced, flat and predictable. The script seemed to have been written by mongoloid monkeys using the pen names Ziggy Steinberg and Rocco Urbisci. How the producers managed to squeeze out such vile cinematic excrement is beyond me. They even managed to make veteran actor Ray Walston look like a talent-less buffoon. Director Michael Schultz should be ashamed of himself.<br /><br />I want the 96 minutes of my life I spent watching this befouled memory of a brilliant comedy back so I can try and convict everyone

{"value":"Apparently, the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so-called \"movie.\" They described \"blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence.\" I saw no \"intrigue.\" I instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie. I saw no \"violence.\" At least, I saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with \"impervious\" skin--but here I am perhaps revealing too much of the \"plot.\" Furthermore, as a viewer of many and sundry films (some of which include the occasional kung fu movie), I can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable.

{"value":"What kind of a documentary about a musician fails to include a single track by the artist himself?! Unlike \"Ray\" or countless other films about music artists, half the fun in the theater (or on the couch) is reliving the great songs themselves. Here, all the tracks are covers put on by uninteresting characters, and these renditions fail to capture Cohen's slow, jazzy style. More often, the covers are badly sung folk versions. Yuck.<br /><br />The interviews are as much or more with other musicians and figures rather than with Cohen himself. Only rarely does the film feature Cohen reading his own work (never singing)-- like letters, poems, etc. The movie really didn't capture much about the artist's life story, either, or about his development through the years.

{"value":"The most embarrassing moment in this film is when Brady Corbet says 'You've blossomed', near the end the film. I practically died. I'm still not really sure why the screenwriters put that line in there. Was it supposed to create romance? Because it nearly made me sick. <br /><br />The rest of the script was almost as bad.<br /><br />I've never liked the original Thunderbirds, but a Thunderbirds movie had the potential to do so much. This movie doesn't. If it didn't have the big draw card of the Thunderbirds brand, it would have been shafted straight to TV, or canned in the post-production. Maybe even before. <br /><br />Like I said, the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll up and they play Busted's song 'Thunderbirds are go'.

{"value":"It is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrible on so many levels. The script, the acting, the directing and the choice of cast are all appalling. The costumes, sets and pseudo-medieval language are also utterly awful. In an odd way I actually enjoyed this film, once I had accepted that it wasn't going to be any good. It seems a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so poor, when really they could have made something pretty decent out of the premise (albeit not very believable!), but instead we are treated to a rather nauseating and cheesy tale of dragons and knights, that lacks any of the charm to be found in other such fantasy films. Let's just hope that The Lord of the Rings is a bit better! Oh, and David Thewlis' haircut makes him look like He-Man.

{"value":"Oh god, what a horrible, horrible film. Meant to be a comment on the state of society, it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality TV. Interstitials hosted by Jason Jones and Don McKellar are the most obnoxious part, written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful. Rather, these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting, condescending speech that shoves the \"meaning\" of the film down the viewer's throat.<br /><br />Also, a point to would-be filmmakers: Long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art. Neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity.<br /><br />If anyone out there is interested in watching this film, please don't. Seriously. Please.

{"value":"I thought the movie was a poor documentary. Nothing of substance was discussed. It seemed to cheapen the ideas and did not provide anything new. The film lacked wonder or romance or anything that would really drive one to science. Most scientists appeared \"stereotyped\" and sometimes weird. A woman said that her awards didn't matter a whole lot, only children that were helped. She said that after a 10 minute scene where she explained all her awards. Playing \"humble scientist\", are we? \"I have equations dancing in my head,\" another said. I don't see how that explains anything to us. It hasn't covered significant effects of science on our culture. Politics of science were barely touched.<br /><br />Not a bad flick for a 10-14 year-olds.

{"value":"I have to say although this movie was formulaic throughout with a plot stolen from films like Friday the 13th/I Know What You Did Last Summer, this movie wasn't that bad. In fact it wasn't as bad as most of the Horror films Hollywood has released recently. The killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most instances just that, original. The cast was mediocre which is to be expected from low-budget features but much better than what that much bigger studio Artisan/Lions Gate has been offering. My only real complaint that wasn't due to the film's budget, which must have been small, was the contrived \"twist\" ending. I'm sorry but this is what put this film in the bad category for me. The ending was just stupid and tacked on.

{"value":"The entire thing is very beautiful to look at..the European location shooting was a good idea. The lead actors are attractive. The score is servicable.<br /><br />BUT THEN THEY SPOKE! And the non-plot developed! And it was all downhill from there. Pacino is sleepwalking and Keller keeps talking about how bored she is..hello, dear, you're not alone. When he does a Mae West imitation, you might have to hide your face, its that painful to watch.<br /><br />I can't imagine how either actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved with this, or a better question, why it ended up stinking so bad?<br /><br />Since death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, maybe you're supposed to have low enjoyment here. Maybe its supposed to feel as empty and cold as death.

{"value":"A worn-out plot of a man who takes the rap for a woman in a murder case + the equally worn-out plot of an outsider on the inside who eventually is shut out.<br /><br />With such an outstanding case, one would think the film would rise above its hackneyed origins. But scene after scene drones by with no change in intensity, no character arcs, and inexplicable behavior.<br /><br />The homosexuality theme was completely unnecessary -- or on the other hand, completely unexplored. It seemed to be included only to titillate the viewers. When will Hollywood learn that having gay characters does not automatically make a more compelling picture?<br /><br />A regrettably dreadful movie. When will Lauren Bacall pick a good one? I expected better of her and Kristin Scott Thomas.

{"value":"The only reason I elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine. All I can say is, it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film. As far as I could tell, Borgnine was the ONLY actor in it. The other performances were so uniformly terrible, I am amazed a studio would actually pay the \"performers\" to appear. Couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that I thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled, and you have a perfect cinematic disaster. Obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children, and to its credit, it was better than most of the original programing on the Disney Channel and similar kid-focused networks.

{"value":"Well, no, not really. Its not really a good movie, but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be. I really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money, and sometimes thats all you can ask for. The plot is OK, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty. The directing is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big problem. There was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, but it wasn't all that hot. All in all, its a fairly average direct to video movie, not the worst film I've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan, check it out sometime.

{"value":"Yay!... I think. It's hard to say. It's hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion. This movie is as sterile as a surgeon's scalpel. For a setting, it has a few stone pillars, some stone seats, a couple stone crosses and some stone actors. They have no emotion! The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is Hamlet, and Hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature. The dubbing really wasn't all that bad though. The voices stuck true to the dull, gloomy, dreary, life-sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth. I have seen this version of Hamlet on the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times, and each of the three times, I was on the brink of turning off the TV, despite it being MST 3K.<br /><br

{"value":"I was at this film's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in 1997. After the screening, when the writer/director and some cast members offered to answer questions, no one could even be bothered to ask any. Rarely has a film been so poorly directed (why on earth were random frames snipped out of some scenes?), wretchedly acted (David Arquette, to paraphrase Dorothy Parker, does not run the emotional gamut from A to B. He parks at A and brings a lunch) and utterly pointless. Characters behave completely out of character for no reason except to force the plot to move in certain directions. At long last, the film comes to a completely random and pointless end that's supposed to \"really make you think.\" Unfortunately, what it makes you think is, \"Well, there's 90 minutes of my life I'm

{"value":"I don't'know... maybe it's because I'm Brazilian but all that stuff was too much. Too much love for the music, too much parties, too much contrast between the nice lives of the main characters (come on, it's not so sad) and the aspect of the city shown by the director. Everything looks too fake to me: the families, the relationships, the music, the \"happiness\". It simply sells a little taste of fake latinamerican culture. I must be honest: it did seduce me a little, but who would not be seduced by that fake lives made of nice music, sex and parties? I'm not that stupid: what kind of world is this one in which people do not suffer of diarrhea, profound sadness and STDs?

{"value":"One of the most disgusting films I have ever seen. I wanted to vomit after watching it. I saw this movie in my American History class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the West during the late 1800's. What we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered, human birth, branding. Oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasn't too bad, but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom. The story itself was OK. The premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy. They live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the West during the late 1800's. But if you have a choice, do not see this
