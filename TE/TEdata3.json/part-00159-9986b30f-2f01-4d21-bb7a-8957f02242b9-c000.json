{"value":"I downloaded this movie yesterday through an internet site the Quality was kinda good! I was watching the movie with high expectations (though i knew it was a flop), especially as the film has superstar Amitabh Bachchan playing the role of a villain.I though at least actors like him would have done some worth to their roles.But unfortunately Mr Bachchan failed to impress as villain this proved that nobody can compete AMJAD KHAN's magic Rgv's trial to re-kindle the past backfired royally! Sholay, the old one is a milestone in Indian cinema with an all-star cast, cult dialogue, stylish cinematography and a brilliant soundtrack which is still a hit with present generations too.A good actor like Ajay Devgan's TALENTS ARE wasted and his performance was average.Prashant Raj, a newcomer doesn't know what acting is . Nisha Kothari proved she is one of the worst actresses we have I don't know how she is still in RGV's crew Urmila & Abhishek seen in a song with no excitement and passion Mohanlal tried his best and Susmitha Sen's work was good i somehow liked her work in this movie It was a Total carnage of the original

{"value":"I was able to hang in for only the first twenty minutes of this low-budget movie. The most glaring absurdity was that while the American inmates in a North Korean POW camp are all supposedly suffering from severe deprivation of food and medicine, going without bathing, shivering in flimsy and filthy parkas, and sleeping on bare floors, and - let's not forget enduring torture - they always manage to sport impeccably coiffed hair. With the exception of a suitably austere-looking Harry Morgan as an army Major, the casting and acting are simply awful. Ronald Regan cannot seem to stick to portraying a single character and instead creates a rather schizophrenic amalgam of past roles. A mostly Caucasian cast portraying the North Korean camp officers might have been forgivable, but when supposedly Russian officers acting as advisors to the Koreans strut around wearing re-badged Nazi uniforms complete with jodhpurs and jackboots (obvious costume-department recycles from WWII flicks) and speaking with accents like General Burkhalter from Hogan's Heroes, well, that's just six kinds of silly. Don't waste your time on this one.","finished_norm":["i","be","abl","to","hang","in","for","onli","the","twenti","minut","of","thi","lowbudget","movi","the","much","glare","absurd","be","that","while","the","american","inmat","in","a","north","korean","pow","camp","be","all","supposedli","suffer","from","sever","depriv","of","food","and","medicin","go","without","bath","shiver","in","flimsi","and","filthi","parka","and","sleep","on","bare","floor","and","let","not","forget","endur","tortur","thei","alwai","manag","to","sport","impecc","coif","hair","with","the","except","of","a","suitabl","austerelook","harri","morgan","a","a","armi","major","the","cast","and","act","be","simpli","aw","ronald","regan","cannot","seem","to","stick","to","portrai","a","singl","charact","and","instead","creat","a","rather","schizophren","amalgam","of","past","role","a","mostli","caucasian","cast","portrai","the","north","korean","camp","offic","mai","have","be","forgiv","but","when","supposedli","russian","offic","act","a","advisor","to","the","korean","strut","around","wear","rebadg","nazi","uniform","complet","with","jodhpur","and","jackboot","obviou","costumedepart","recycl","from","wwii","flick","and","speak","with","accent","like","gener","burkhalt","from","hogan","hero","good","that","just","six","kind","of","silli","do","not","wast","your","time","on","thi","on"],"filtered":["abl","hang","onli","twenti","minut","thi","lowbudget","movi","much","glare","absurd","american","inmat","north","korean","pow","camp","supposedli","suffer","sever","depriv","food","medicin","go","without","bath","shiver","flimsi","filthi","parka","sleep","bare","floor","let","forget","endur","tortur","thei","alwai","manag","sport","impecc","coif","hair","except","suitabl","austerelook","harri","morgan","armi","major","cast","act","simpli","aw","ronald","regan","seem","stick","portrai","singl","charact","instead","creat","rather","schizophren","amalgam","past","role","mostli","caucasian","cast","portrai","north","korean","camp","offic","mai","forgiv","supposedli","russian","offic","act","advisor","korean","strut","around","wear","rebadg","nazi","uniform","complet","jodhpur","jackboot","obviou","costumedepart","recycl","wwii","flick","speak","accent","like","gener","burkhalt","hogan","hero","good","six","kind","silli","wast","time","thi"],"filtered2":["abl","hang","onli","twenti","minut","lowbudget","glare","absurd","american","inmat","north","korean","pow","camp","supposedli","suffer","sever","depriv","food","medicin","go","without","bath","shiver","flimsi","filthi","parka","sleep","bare","floor","let","forget","endur","tortur","alwai","manag","sport","impecc","coif","hair","except","suitabl","austerelook","harri","morgan","armi","major","cast","act","simpli","aw","ronald","regan","seem","stick","portrai","singl","charact","instead","creat","rather","schizophren","amalgam","past","role","mostli","caucasian","cast","portrai","north","korean","camp","offic","mai","forgiv","supposedli","russian","offic","act","advisor","korean","strut","around","wear","rebadg","nazi","uniform","complet","jodhpur","jackboot","obviou","costumedepart","recycl","wwii","flick","speak","accent","like","gener","burkhalt","hogan","hero","good","six","kind","silli","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,10,11,21,35,46,59,89,92,98,103,122,124,125,128,138,152,160,197,201,223,225,233,257,316,344,345,362,373,375,383,385,404,416,440,443,454,469,510,514,559,587,589,633,732,802,813,848,908,928,946,982,1010,1222,1234,1237,1310,1348,1390,1572,1676,1755,1934,2042,2161,2392,2519,2578,2714,2767,2883,3156,3557,4803,4844,5506,5758,6205,6319,6405,6730,7034,7852],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,10,11,21,35,46,59,89,92,98,103,122,124,125,128,138,152,160,197,201,223,225,233,257,316,344,345,362,373,375,383,385,404,416,440,443,454,469,510,514,559,587,589,633,732,802,813,848,908,928,946,982,1010,1222,1234,1237,1310,1348,1390,1572,1676,1755,1934,2042,2161,2392,2519,2578,2714,2767,2883,3156,3557,4803,4844,5506,5758,6205,6319,6405,6730,7034,7852],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,2.324031090670098,1.463169012899134,1.655771293751733,1.8693254449200722,1.9940046109572438,4.0979070738271774,2.0881990796736947,2.098582041218749,2.2489347673732487,2.2323930368088845,2.2242236634876535,2.3409902041158843,2.2907365189289424,2.3131195476980753,2.3722295531801256,2.558331832813986,2.561435818751577,2.825563294794476,2.641219492619754,2.6102777977348763,2.7602659523229094,2.878207028279898,2.983093497946387,3.0022328381570844,3.058539100262467,3.0316467

{"value":"This is an extremely silly and little seen film about slavery in the West Indies and it stars Puddy from the \"Seinfeld\" show! Patrick Warburton made his film debut in this contrived movie and he's noticeably slimmer here. Oliver Reed got top billing but he's hardly in the film at all. Warburton plays a white slave and its funny to see all the young and horny wives of rich old men bidding on him because they all want to have sex with him. Eartha Kitt plays an owner of a bordello and they're is so much nudity in the film. If its not drunken orgies at the bordello then its the young wives having they're turn with him. Then of course towards the end the slaves revolt and there's the bloody standoff. No real political message like the film \"Burn\" but just another contrived plot device to move the story along. Incredibly they made a sequel and Warburton and all the rest of the cast came back! I hope they got paid a lot of dough because this first film is pretty bad. The nudity keeps it watchable and Warburton's lack of any accent make it at times laughable. Very bad film but I got to admit that I want to see the

I am very confuse about the writer is \"Demons III: The Ogre\" (Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writer and stupid who the bored William Shakespeare ghost or demon's egg from Spider's web or what Huhuhuhuhu make the girl dream). I am very sorry, very very very very boring movie. I Bought The special DVD box called \"Demons\" on the 3 different movies called \"Demons III: The Ogre\", \"The Other Hell\", and \"Black Demons\" don't have closed captioned and Subtitles is cost $ 14.99 from Best Buy store in the City of Downey. Why the Lamberto Bava and Dardano Sacchetti are poor quality writer who make the stupid movie almost like \"Halloween III\" don't have Michael Myer monster but the people wear Halloween. I am very confused. I really love \"The Demons\" and \"The Demons 2 are better the boring stupid \"Demons III: The Ogre\" is not part for \"The Demons\" and \"The Demons 2\" are same demons.<br /><br />Thank you Juan

{"value":"Robert Taylor definitely showed himself to be a fine dramatic actor in his role as a gun-slinging buffalo hunter in this 1956 western. It was one of the few times that Taylor would play a heavy in a film. Nonetheless, this picture was far from great as shortly after this, Taylor fled to television with the successful series The Detectives.<br /><br />Stuart Granger hid his British accent and turned in a formidable performance as Taylor's partner. <br /><br />Taylor is a bigot here and his hatred for the Indians really shows.<br /><br />Another very good performance here was by veteran actor Lloyd Nolan as an aged, drinking old-timer who joined in the hunt for buffalo as well. In his early scenes, Nolan was really doing an excellent take-off of Walter Huston in his Oscar-winning role in The Treasure of the Sierre Madre in 1948. Note the appearance of Russ Tamblyn in the film. The following year Tamblyn and Nolan would join in the phenomenal Peyton Place.<br /><br />The writing in the film is stiff at best. By the film's end, it's the elements of nature that did Taylor in.

{"value":"I just want to make one thing clear- I love Michael Vartan! But this film really lets him down. His acting is still superb, he's still as charming as ever, and he still looks great. But the film itself is a load of rubbish! Natasha Henstridge, I'm sorry to say it, comes over bit manly... you're constantly waiting for her to run off with her best friend, who's own sub-storyline is a little weird. Myself and my family (who sat down and watched the film with me) were also put off by the soundtrack to the film; at times the music just didn't fit with what was going on in the scenes. However, even this was not the worst aspect of what I found to be a very disappointing film. I could forgive the leading lady's butch-ness, I could forgive the freakish characters that were thrown in to the mix, and I could forgive the poor choice of musical accompaniment, but whose choice was it to cut out the whole middle section of the film and skip straight to the end??? The ending was obviously planned from the beginning but how it gets there is left untold.

{"value":"I had not seen the movie trailer when I went to see the movie, instead I based my judgments on a friend's opinions. Now I like Chris Rock and his comedy, but this movie just falls flat on its face.<br /><br />During the movie Rock delivers a couple of funny jokes, but unfortunately the movie is sorely lacking in comedy. The movie seems want to integrate both laughter and love into one, and it that endeavor it fails. The love story in the movie is straight forward (luckily), but it detracts too much from the movie by making Rock serious and bland. After all, the movie is first and foremost destined to be a comedy, where laughter should be the primary concern. Not much of that in the movie.<br /><br />The plot is also pretty uninteresting as a whole. Some parts were discontinuous altogether. If the supporting cast were meant to be funny, they certainly didn't do a good job. The couple of angels from heaven tried to make a couple of jokes, which were dry and dull. Rock's first incarnation's couple of underlings were also bland.

{"value":"There's a lot of good that can be said for this cartoon; the backgrounds are rich, lushly colored and full of nicely done art deco details. The animation is up to the usual studio standards of the time, which are unquestionably higher than those of the present day. However, I find it tedious for a number of reasons.<br /><br />The Music: It's definitely not up to Scott Bradley's usual standards. Although it's probably supposed to be evocative of a \"Great Gatsby\" setting, it ends up being dreary, sleepy, repetitious AND monotonous (repetitious and monotonous are not the same, as Beethoven's 5th Symphony attests). Since most people (including me) tend to close their eyes when they yawn, there's a lot of the visual part of the cartoon that will be missed by the average viewer.<br /><br />The Storyline: I'm not giving away any secrets that aren't already in the plot summary - country good, city bad. This is a common theme in films, both animated and live, from this era. It's a misplaced nostalgia for a nonexistent rural idyll, which, in the present day, is reflected in a similar nostalgia for \"values\" that never

{"value":"I really must have caught a different film from the rest of the commentators on this site because at a screening of the film last night the audience was so mortified by the dialoge that (I'm not even kidding)half walked out. Shot as if the filmmaker thought he were approaching some daring new territory by presenting a homosexual coming-of-age story, the film utilizes David Lynch inspired visuals with Fassbinder inspired acting. The performances in this film are so dull and bored that I figured one of the actors was going to pass out by how uninspired they seemed to be by the script. What's worse is that it's colored like an episode of Miami Vice. I don't know who this director thinks he is; maybe he has pretensions of the surreal like Bunuel, Jordowsky, etc. But the problem is that all of the afore mentioned directors display a level of erudite sensibility that is sorely lacking here. I could understand the meaningfulness of this film about ten years ago, but when we've got masterpieces such as Bad Eduction, Mysterious Skin and Show Me Love why bother with this cinematic turd?

{"value":"I watched this movie on march 21 this year.Must say disappointment.But much better than \"Tridev\".Plot is hackneyed.Tells about Prabhat who lives with his father,Wife and his little brother.The movie opens when he saves a bride.Anyway.Azghar Jhurhad makes a plot to kill his young brother.He makes a plan by sending few man.They come to a school pretended to be Prabhats friends.Kill that kid.His father throws him out of the house.Then later comes back.He and Aakash go to Kenya to find him.Sunny gives a good performance,Chunky was annoying at best,Naseerdun is wasted.Divya did good,Sonam was wasted,Jyotsna was wasted but looked cute.The kid which played Sunnys brother in the movie was cute.Too sad he had to get his character killed.The girl was cute but was annoying.The other kid did good.Alok did good.Kiran was adequate.Amrish and Gulshan did good.The cinematography is excellent in both India and Kenya.Script is weak but has a few good dialogs.Also drags .The movie.The music was alright.I only liked one song\"Saat Samundar\" the lyrics of that song was good.The other songs were forgettable.Don't watch this.

{"value":"This is quite possibly THE worst movie I have ever seen. Again I made the mistake of buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (After buying this and the movie \"Malevolence\" which I reviewed on here as well, I have learned my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This supposedly takes place in the woods of Texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard. The production was probably the worst I ever seen. The actors were absolutely the WORST. The story didn't have anything to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other \"mom and pop\" store that buys used DVDs and neither would take it. Thats how awful this poor miserable excuse for a movie was. I have seen some bad movies before (Troll 2 for example) but this definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a worse movie than \"Troll 2\". Boy was I wrong!

{"value":"Where's Michael Caine when you need him? I've seen most of the many seasons of MST3K, but this rare pre-1st season flick (episdoe K-20) is easily one of the worst movies ever made. Three \"stars\", Lee Majors, Chris Makepeace and Burgess Meredith, struggle through the worst batch of cinematography ever, delivering lines which must have been written by a secret Dick Cheney-style workgroup composed of Exxon and GM lawyers trying to cut funding for mass transit and energy efficiency research. Looks like it was filmed in almost total darkness, possibly on Super 8. Makes Logan's Run look like the cinematic Sistine Chapel crossed with Shakespeare. I can't imagine watching it without the commentary of Crow and Servo since it's unwatchable even with it. Clearly what's needed in Hollywood is some sort of 401K which prevents the need for actors to take on bad movies like this in order to pay for their health care. With its \"rights to pollute and drive\" theme, by the end, I'm half expecting to see a Charlton Heston cameo where he delivers his \"cold dead hands\" speech.

{"value":"It would help to know why it took so long for a book as movie-ready' as \"The House Next Door\" to be adapted for film or television. The book was copyrighted in 1978. One reason could be problems designing 'the house'. The house in this Lifetime film is really so ugly that I can't imagine anyone buying it. In fact it's so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was built.<br /><br />I'm not crazy about horror genre books, but this one was hard to put down when I came across it around ten years ago. The main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life, and this is one of the book's strengths. They are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demon..(or the devil personified) without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book. However, it is a downbeat book for the most part, and I don't think that appeals to the people who run Lifetime. Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come. A better house..better music..a better screenplay and darker lighting...would certainly

{"value":"Flat, ordinary thriller about a conniving woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves in order to boost her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceptive Tracey, married to the doting Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend of Andy's named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) turns up as the resident surgeon, trouble is not far behind him.<br /><br />Script fails in that it does not carefully develop the promising premise into an effective, tantalising thriller, and the severe lack of character motivation, background and development leaves the whole show reaching. None of the cast are able to generate interest in their shallow characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose own inexplicably curious Andy is impossible to believe.<br /><br />Poor director Harold Becker is left trying to resurrect an impossibly dead project, and is unable to make entertainment from any of it. By the time the 'secret' of the plot is revealed, you just won't care.<br /><br />At least the cinematography has Massachusetts looking good. Also stars George C.

{"value":"I agree with those reviews I have read here, and I have no words to define such a turkey like this, but despite everything, I still can find a reason for movies like this to exist. Do you remenber those happy days in which video was a prosperous business, and a lot of movies were made with the only reason of filling the shelves of the video stores? this movie comes from that period and I can imagine that was the only reason for which it was produced and the same happened with many, many, many other stinkers. Do you remember \"Rambo\" imitations? and so many slashers of Z grade?, I still feel nostalgia for that period.About this movie I can say I didn´t waste my time watching it because I pressed the fast forward button after the first fifteen minutes, just to find a very funny scene in which a guy was pushing an axe against heads which exploded because, as you perfectly notice, they were made of plastic. And about the end, well, it was so badly filmed I could not understand what happened. That´s the same, I had not followed the non-existing plot at all.

{"value":"Woody Allen has lost his ability to write dialogue or characters that are clearly distinguishable from each other. This is the case with \"Melinda and Melinda,\" where all the characters speak with Allen's generic pseudo-sophistication and have problems and points of view that are not relatable to anyone outside of a four block radius of where Allen lives. They also share the same curious condition of being able to afford multi-million dollar Manhattan apartments that appear to have been designed by professional decorators regardless of their financial situation or what they do for a living.<br /><br />The only character who exists outside of this dull mindset is Will Ferrel as the obligatory Woody Allen surrogate. Although he does not simply come off as merely doing a Woody Allen impression (like Kenneth Branagh in the god-awful \"Celebrity\"), Ferrel lacks the charm or charisma that the real Woody had when he was playing the part himself in his best movies.<br /><br />The end result is another in a string of self indulgent bores from a once-great filmmaker who has been trading in on his former reputation

{"value":"Creature Unknown is the right word for this movie. Or maybe it should be called Unknown Movie. This movie is a piece of crap right from the beginning. It has a really stupid \"plot,\" really pathetic \"acting,\" and so-so \"special effects.\" <br /><br />Some thirty-something year old \"post-teens\" are trapped in the woods with a mad, reptilian, rubber-suit creature lurking around endlessly. What you get with this movie is a bunch of talk and precious little action. You have girls walking through the woods talking, and then you have guys (with heavy mascara on) walking through the woods talking. The whole thing is so boring!<br /><br />The creature itself is rarely seen throughout most of the movie. When it is shown the picture is distorted to mask the fact that it is a man in a rubber suit, and the movement shows that it is a suit, hence the reason for the blurring and distortion of the image. <br /><br />This is NOT a good movie in ANY since of the word and the ones here who have praised it are most likely the people that were picked up off the street to \"act\" in this truly stupefying movie!

{"value":"This complete mess of a movie was directed by Bill Rebane, the man partly responsible for the truly infamous anti-classic Monster a-Go Go. As I was nearing the end of The Cold I came to the unbelievable conclusion that this film was in fact even worse than that 60's shocker. The story  such as it is  is about three eccentric millionaires who invite a group of people to their remote mansion to play a series of macabre games. Whoever manages to last the pace and survive to the end will win $1,000,000. It's a very simple plot but Rebane still somehow manages to make proceedings verge on incomprehensible. Things happen. Characters are completely forgotten about. Nothing makes too much sense. And then it ends. Weirdly. I mean what the hell was that ending all about exactly? I guess you are left to draw your own conclusions. Production values and acting are without question of a pornographic movie standard. In truth Pamela Rohleder (Shelly) isn't even that good. She is so unbelievably terrible she's compelling.

{"value":"This movie shows a row of sketches, which partly pass over into one another. I realized the passing over late in the movie, at first it only irritated me. <br /><br />Many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact, using absurdity and obscenity. The attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails.<br /><br />My personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie (My god, it hurts in my head every time I call it \"movie\"): A bold attempt to turn nothing into something great. But it failed. At least the director made something out of nothing. But it isn't something good.<br /><br />Many movies didn't turn out as funny as they were planned, but this one tops them all. It's the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making. No. To correct myself, it's even worse than that. A movie with gags so bad, that they aren't funny at all. It's not even fun to watch the lead-actor, writer and director (all three the same guy by the way) perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies.

{"value":"I imagine that the young people involved in the making of \"Necromancy\" (aka \"The Witching\" plus a bunch of other titles) must have felt a little weird being on the set of a horror movie with the man who: participated with John Houseman in the production of a proletarian play (\"The Cradle Will Rock\"); scared people into thinking that aliens were invading (\"The War of the Worlds\"); and directed and starred in the greatest movie of all time (\"Citizen Kane\"). And now Orson Welles was starring in a third-rate flick about a satanic cult.<br /><br />There's basically nothing creative about this movie. Lots of nudity, but the background music always proves really distracting. Even if the movie wasn't particularly predictable, it still wasn't worth seeing. How low Welles had sunk. Fortunately, over the final thirteen years of his life, he narrated the documentary \"Bugs Bunny Superstar\" (about the Warner Bros. cartoons of the 1940s) and hosted the documentary \"The Man who Saw Tomorrow\" (about Nostradamus). I recommend those two, but not this one.

{"value":"The plot is rocky. The acting is somewhere south of a Jr. High School play. The cinematography is not bad but it looks like it was cut with a machete. I couldn't decide of this was an intentionally hokey flick or if the people behind it actually thought they were making a good film. Think Death Valley Days meets Mayberry RFD. People running around in a 'lawless' modern town wearing quick-draw 6 gun rigs. It has more than its fair share of 'cutsey' stuff. Picture the Good Guys pulling up to an old farm house, and parking the Ford Mustang right in front of a hitching rail. Picture the clerk in a hotel watching an obviously western (hemisphere) movie sporting a Japanese sound track but with English sub-titles. It's all really strange but might be improved if watching it while partaking in a little peyote. It's a real curiosity with modern parallels to every western movie cliché you can think of. There's even a modern version of the good hearted dance-hall girl, AND a twanging Jew's-harp in the soundtrack. Really!

{"value":"<br /><br />Upon concluding my viewing of \"Trance,\" or \"The Eternal,\" or whatever the producers are calling this film, I wondered to myself, \"Out of all of the bad movies I could have seen, couldn't I have at least seen one that was entertaining?\" Even if a film is not well made in terms of acting, directing, writing, or what have you, it can at least be fun, and therefore worthwhile. But not only is this film bad in artistic value, it's incredibly boring. For a plot of such thinness, it moves awfully slowly, with little dramatic tension. At the very least, in a low-brow attempt at entertainment, the deaths of the characters could have been cool and/or gory, but the creators of this dreck failed in that department as well.<br /><br />What does this movie have going for it? Pretty much nothing, unless you get entertainment out of watching Christopher Walken, who is capable of being brilliant, put so little effort into his acting that he falls into self-parody mode (WHY did he decide to do this film anyway?).<br /><br />I give this film 3/10, because, God help us, there actually have been worse movies made before.","finished_norm":["br","br","upon","conclud","my","view","of","tranc","or","the","etern","or","whatev","the","produc","be","call","thi","film","i","wonder","to","myself","out","of","all","of","the","bad","movi","i","can","have","see","can","not","i","have","at","littl","see","on","that","be","entertain","even","if","a","film","be","not","good","make","in","term","of","act","direct","write","or","what","have","you","it","can","at","littl","be","fun","and","therefor","worthwhil","but","not","onli","be","thi","film","bad","in","artist","valu","it","incredibli","bore","for","a","plot","of","such","thin","it","move","awfulli","slowli","with","littl","dramat","tension","at","the","veri","littl","in","a","lowbrow","attempt","at","entertain","the","death","of","the","charact","can","have","be","cool","andor","gori","but","the","creator","of","thi","dreck","fail","in","that","depart","a","wellbr","br","what","doe","thi","movi","have","go","for","it","pretti","much","noth","unless","you","get","entertain","out","of","watch","christoph","walken","who","be","capabl","of","be","brilliant","put","so","littl","effort","into","hi","act","that","he","fall","into","selfparodi","mode","why","do","he","decid","to","do","thi","film","anywaybr","br","i","give","thi","film","becaus","god","help","u","there","actual","have","be","wrong","movi","make","befor"],"filtered":["br","br","upon","conclud","view","tranc","etern","whatev","produc","call","thi","film","wonder","bad","movi","see","littl","see","entertain","even","film","good","make","term","act","direct","write","littl","fun","therefor","worthwhil","onli","thi","film","bad","artist","valu","incredibli","bore","plot","thin","move","awfulli","slowli","littl","dramat","tension","veri","littl","lowbrow","attempt","entertain","death","charact","cool","andor","gori","creator","thi","dreck","fail","depart","wellbr","br","doe","thi","movi","go","pretti","much","noth","unless","get","entertain","watch","christoph","walken","capabl","brilliant","put","littl","effort","hi","act","fall","selfparodi","mode","decid","thi","film","anywaybr","br","give","thi","film","becaus","god","help","u","actual","wrong","movi","make","befor"],"filtered2":["upon","conclud","view","tranc","etern","whatev","produc","call","wonder","bad","see","littl","see","entertain","even","good","make","term","act","direct","write","littl","fun","therefor","worthwhil","onli","bad","artist","valu","incredibli","bore","plot","thin","move","awfulli","slowli","littl","dramat","tension","veri","littl","lowbrow","attempt","entertain","death","charact","cool","andor","gori","creator","dreck","fail","depart","wellbr","doe","go","pretti","noth","unless","get","entertain","watch","christoph","walken","capabl","brilliant","put","littl","effort","act","fall","selfparodi","mode","decid","anywaybr","give","becaus","god","help","u","actual","wrong","make","befor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,14,15,18,21,22,25,30,32,49,52,65,78,79,102,108,112,142,159,170,175,177,185,195,215,245,249,259,261,275,312,352,401,451,460,481,556,630,687,724,756,858,886,912,980,1162,1228,1374,1488,1539,1739,2016,2080,2114,2322,2347,2504,2536,2648,2778,4124,4371,6100,7195],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,14,15,18,21,22,25,30,32,49,52,65,78,79,102,108,112,142,159,170,175,177,185,195,215,245,249,259,261,275,312,352,401,451,460,481,556,630,687,724,756,858,886,912,980,1162,1228,1374,1488,1539,1739,2016,2080,2114,2322,2347,2504,2536,2648,2778,4124,4371,6100,7195],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,5.5875409986296045,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,2.324031090670098,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.6920303308087352,1.7122153074726136,1.9073850067444174,2.0064197866819473,1.9469506069506084,2.087553710177271,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,2.2844323215331563,2.300267965194495,2.4071371113909277,2.3791142619576227,2.458149992634611,2.518833027372001,7.53867724752564,2.605934685587711,2.7502029743242886,2.6754694156628323,2.7464553122240485,2.7085302779237206,2.7832848715031413,2.8824835850471584,3.1236456418640466,3.0879275592619675,3.216957819005698,3.216957819005698,3.353630724994973,3.4471119148061256,3.558633189238533,3.604618302480356,3.7987743169213135,3.7636829971100436,3.8767358583910254,3.944626193933877,3.9405024767500145,4.081705786614497,4.383707912841026,4.3095999406873045,4.416284083275639,4.581533656170946,4.5432147918688095,4.733083554298147,4.900964426937307

{"value":"A good cast and they do their best with what they're given, but the story makes no sense, the characters' actions are inexplicable, and there are too many moments of unintentional humor, as when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces of a phonograph record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts off. The scene when the two witch and her victim (played by the same actress) are in the house together sets up like a 3 Stooges routine, and the plot begs the question: if the witch wants to possess this other woman's soul, why doesn't she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate chase? Not to be missed is Christopher Walkin's eyeglasses and his automotive explanation of the afterlife (paraphrased): \"The ancient Egyptianas - they wee materialists. They expected the body to last through eternity, like a used car that you souped up. But the Druids, they knew you couldn't drive in the afterlife. You had to get out and walk.\" Huh? The ending is absolutely indecipherable.

{"value":"OK, so I am an original Wicker Man fan and I usually don't like British films remade by Americans, so why oh why did I put myself through the most painful cinema experiences ever? I am not a Nicolas Cage fan and I had some kind of moment of madness perhaps? The film was appalling! The bit at the beginning with the crash/fire had no relevance to the film at all and the female cop knew where Edward was going, so the bit at the end with the two girls visiting the mainland, well it wouldn't have happened as the whole thing would have been investigated. The history behind the wicker man wasn't really explored - and I guess being set in America didn't really help the whole pagan theme. This film was slow and contained no atmosphere or suspense. I must say that the best bit was right at the end, when Nicolas Cage goes up in flames! I am in such desperate need to see the original again now, in order to cleanse my disappointed soul.

{"value":"I rented this on DVD yesterday and did not realize it was a \"character study\" type of movie, so I struggled to watch about an hour of it before hitting the Stop button.<br /><br />Even with a character study theme, I just could not get into this film at all. Perhaps it was my mood in wanting to watch something else, or maybe I had other expectations, but setting that aside, I tried my best to move on to finish watching, but gave up. The actors played their roles well, but the global combination did not come together to keep my interest. About the only interesting thing was the sergeant's gun being stolen and he hurried to buy another one, and spray painted it black to appear as police issue. I think this movie should have been entitled, \"Who Stole the Sergeant's Gun?\" Scenes were well done but putting them together I once again felt robbed for anything cohesive to keep me viewing.<br /><br />Since I didn't finish watching it I'd say there is some merit to renting this film ... maybe. To me, it was a waste of good viewing effort and time.

{"value":"Very silly movie, filled with stupid one liners and Jewish references thru out. It was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously. A familiar movie plot...Being at the wrong place at the wrong time. An atrocious subplot, involving Kim Bassinger. Very robotic and too regimented. I have noticed that Al Pacinos acting abilities seem to be going downhill. A troubleshooter with troubles , but nothing more troubling than Pacinos horrible Atlanta accent. Damage control needs to fix this damage of a film. OK my one liners are bad, but not as bad as the ones in this film. This movie manages to not only be boring but revolting as well. Usually a revolting film is watchable for the wrong reasons. This movie is unwatchable. I did manage to sit through this. The plot ,if written a tad bit better, with , perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrendous subplot,and even dumber jokes, could have pulled this thriller out of the doldrums. What we are left with is a dull, silly movie that made sure it was drilled into our heads that Eli Wurman was Jewish.

{"value":"If Deborah Messing were not already cast as \"Grace\", this might be a tolerable film. However, it is simply another story of a frustrated spinster with issues, who hires a paid escort (Dermot Mulroney) she reads about in a Time magazine article to travel to London for her sister's London wedding. How new is this plot?<br /><br />Neither funny, nor remotely romantic, the Wedding Date slides over the storyline of deceptive sex by bride and best man, and paid for escorts to pass off the film as Four Weddings without Hugh, and definitely, a dead end deal for the naive groom who is ignorant to the sexual history of his bride (Amy Adams). While Messing has perfected the repressed princess, 30- something woman with a failed relationship history, her neurotic and drunken moves on yet another faux beau is simply the restating of her TV series. If this woman is an actress, get a role that does not rehash what is already on prime time.<br /><br />Lots of drunken female bonding, cricket visual jokes, and Mulroney in a towel (nice!), but the film is a bore with the obvious happy ending.

{"value":"As someone who likes chase scenes and was really intrigued by this fascinating true-life tale, I was optimistic heading into this film but too many obstacles got into the way of the good story it should have been.<br /><br />THE BAD - I'm a fan of Robert Duvall and many of the characters he has played, but his role here is a dull one as an insurance investigator.<br /><br />The dialog is insipid and the pretty Kathryn Harrold is real garbage-mouth. From what I read, there were several directors replacing each other on this film, and that's too bad. You can tell things aren't right with the story. I couldn't get \"involved\" with Treat Williams' portrayal of Cooper, either. He should have been fascinating, but he wasn't in this movie. It's also kind of a sad comment that a guy committing a crime is some sort of \"folk hero,\" but I admit I wound up rooting for the guy, too.<br /><br />Not everything was disappointing. I can't complain about the scenery, from the lush, green forests of Oregon to the desert in Arizona.<br /><br />I'd like to see this movie re-made and done better, because it is a one-of-a-kind story.","finished_norm":["a","someon","who","like","chase","scene","and","be","realli","intrigu","by","thi","fascin","truelif","tale","i","be","optimist","head","into","thi","film","but","too","mani","obstacl","get","into","the","wai","of","the","good","stori","it","should","have","beenbr","br","the","bad","i","be","a","fan","of","robert","duval","and","mani","of","the","charact","he","have","plai","but","hi","role","here","be","a","dull","on","a","a","insur","investigatorbr","br","the","dialog","be","insipid","and","the","pretti","kathryn","harrold","be","real","garbagemouth","from","what","i","read","there","be","sever","director","replac","each","other","on","thi","film","and","that","too","bad","you","can","tell","thing","be","not","right","with","the","stori","i","can","not","get","involv","with","treat","william","portray","of","cooper","either","he","should","have","be","fascin","but","he","be","not","in","thi","movi","it","conjur","kind","of","a","sad","comment","that","a","gui","commit","a","crime","be","some","sort","of","folk","hero","but","i","admit","i","wind","up","root","for","the","gui","toobr","br","not","everyth","be","disappoint","i","ca","not","complain","about","the","sceneri","from","the","lush","green","forest","of","oregon","to","the","desert","in","arizonabr","br","i","have","like","to","see","thi","movi","remak","and","do","well","becaus","it","be","a","oneofakind","stori"],"filtered":["someon","like","chase","scene","realli","intrigu","thi","fascin","truelif","tale","optimist","head","thi","film","mani","obstacl","get","wai","good","stori","beenbr","br","bad","fan","robert","duval","mani","charact","plai","hi","role","dull","insur","investigatorbr","br","dialog","insipid","pretti","kathryn","harrold","real","garbagemouth","read","sever","director","replac","thi","film","bad","tell","thing","right","stori","get","involv","treat","william","portray","cooper","either","fascin","thi","movi","conjur","kind","sad","comment","gui","commit","crime","sort","folk","hero","admit","wind","root","gui","toobr","br","everyth","disappoint","ca","complain","sceneri","lush","green","forest","oregon","desert","arizonabr","br","like","see","thi","movi","remak","well","becaus","oneofakind","stori"],"filtered2":["someon","like","chase","scene","realli","intrigu","fascin","truelif","tale","optimist","head","mani","obstacl","get","wai","good","stori","beenbr","bad","fan","robert","duval","mani","charact","plai","role","dull","insur","investigatorbr","dialog","insipid","pretti","kathryn","harrold","real","garbagemouth","read","sever","director","replac","bad","tell","thing","right","stori","get","involv","treat","william","portray","cooper","either","fascin","conjur","kind","sad","comment","gui","commit","crime","sort","folk","hero","admit","wind","root","gui","toobr","everyth","disappoint","ca","complain","sceneri","lush","green","forest","oregon","desert","arizonabr","like","see","remak","well","becaus","oneofakind","stori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,9,10,13,17,19,20,22,29,33,39,40,50,55,58,78,80,81,90,121,122,128,139,140,145,187,193,207,208,241,269,280,316,367,375,432,455,483,530,539,691,719,753,820,849,969,1005,1009,1017,1138,1172,1187,1202,1258,1362,1423,1637,1831,2286,2718,2750,3563,4109,4954,5126,5169,5667,8031],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,9,10,13,17,19,20,22,29,33,39,40,50,55,58,78,80,81,90,121,122,128,139,140,145,187,193,207,208,241,269,280,316,367,375,432,455,483,530,539,691,719,753,820,849,969,1005,1009,1017,1138,1172,1187,1202,1258,1362,1423,1637,1831,2286,2718,2750,3563,4109,4954,5126,5169,5667,8031],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,3.83116108203179,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,3.43598877114071,3.9073995778510735,1.865701314626681,2.0064197866819473,1.9951803900462557,1.949757232424728,2.0477128419653545,2.2190595059394194,2.2489347673732487,2.3409902041158843,2.2939035841256437,2.317169775997098,2.34599021453259,2.4732161909892554,2.517840471459249,2.5531798379045583,2.6289494000279396,2.6627744961815836,2.76533567167316,2.8028805344481915,2.878207028279898,3.0791938792932125,3.2597778161886266,3.235085203598255,3.2787058260741455,3.613480989738201,3.5784919978881358,3.6105180246075443,3.5929222627171646,3.857614816944247,3.8690435127678695,3.900174431363043,3.880604335168946,4.0536665665501035,4.086456389373095,4.096025840389245,4.0536665665501035,4.224077767249142,4.327618446189983,4.436351646326448,4.315570107673808,8.69193516971636,4.396

{"value":"Saw this film ran in the wee hours on TCM. Several problems with the film were apparent from what I saw. First, the adults did not age when the children did for 10 years. Several parts of the film had continuity problems & for some reason the actor who played the youngest son looked like the oldest when the 10 years passed. <br /><br />The copy I saw was missing about 20 minutes or so, at least a huge gap with black screen appeared. It is too bad, because even though the script left something to be desired, Bergman & Russell both did fine in the film in their roles. It is a shame the large chunk is missing, but what is here is watchable.<br /><br />I just wish it was all intact. The script makes little sense in that Bergman's character is sent away when the kids are small but then brought back to take care of them when they are adults? Some of the time lines don't make sense either. There is a stock market crash that resembles 1929 but the kids grow up to fight in World War 1. All the acting by the support folks in this film is fine.

{"value":"With the MASSIVE advertising this is getting on Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. and that ilk, my son was bugging us to see it. Between DVD and the theaters, I've seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding (Incredibles, Shrek) to the really bad (Wall-E, Brother Bear). But this was easily the worst movie I've ever seen, kids or no kids. It was a \"when it this stupid thing going to end?\" kind of experience? OK, it's aimed at toddlers (or it better be - it's insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3), but I've never seen something so predictable, repetitive, and slow-moving. Then once you're finally fed up but relieved that the movie is over, there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke, but there isn't one - it's serious, though it's hard to tell what they're trying to accomplish. The 3-D effects... yeah, if you've never seen a Viewmaster they're a big deal, otherwise no (if you look at the screen without glasses, it appears to be the same process). Even my son was bored by the end. Both my wife and I looked at each other and said \"wow\" at the end.

{"value":"There were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this film certainly isn't one of them! It's a shame The Child isn't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. The plot is basically this: young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge (as you do). This is all well and good, except for the fact that it's boring! Nothing happens for most of the film, and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore; it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it. The film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. There's really not much I can say about the film overall as there isn't much to it. The Child is a dismal seventies horror flick and I certainly don't recommend
