{"value":"After seeing the trailer of this film in the cinema, i thought that it was an original concept for a thriller, setting it in the competitive world of computer companies. The all star cast was another message that this film would probably be good. But when i didn't go to watch it in it's first week of release then it disappeared by week 2 i feared something was a miss. Patiently i waited for it's DVD release, then bought it rushing home for an enjoyable evening's viewing. The anticipation on the way home was far better than the film. For a start the direction is appalling. There's no thought gone into it at all and the director just makes up a part for himself, so he can appear in the film. I wouldn't be rushing out to employ him in the future. Secondly the lead role is completely miscast as Ryan Phillipe. Phillipe normally the cool character as in Cruel Intentions and Way of the Gun but in this he's supposed to be a bumbling hero which he attempts to portray by slipping when he's running and having geeky friends, but he just doesn't look right. The female stars, Rachel Leigh Cook and Clare Forlani don't feature enough but when they do neither of the performances are close to their bests. The only highlight of the film is Tim Robbins in a role that could have been made for him and it's his fiery temper and mysterious ways that drag the film along. The final point is that this film is another one which fills the trailer with scenes you don't see in the film and instead feature only in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. Causing even more disappointment as although some of these scenes are crude they do fill in important gaps in the story.","finished_norm":["after","see","the","trailer","of","thi","film","in","the","cinema","i","think","that","it","be","a","origin","concept","for","a","thriller","set","it","in","the","competit","world","of","comput","compani","the","all","star","cast","be","anoth","messag","that","thi","film","would","probabl","be","good","but","when","i","do","not","go","to","watch","it","in","it","week","of","releas","then","it","disappear","by","week","i","fear","someth","be","a","miss","patient","i","wait","for","it","dvd","releas","then","bui","it","rush","home","for","a","enjoy","even","view","the","anticip","on","the","wai","home","be","far","well","than","the","film","for","a","start","the","direct","be","appal","there","no","think","go","into","it","at","all","and","the","director","just","make","up","a","part","for","himself","so","he","can","appear","in","the","film","i","would","not","be","rush","out","to","emploi","him","in","the","futur","secondli","the","lead","role","be","complet","miscast","a","ryan","phillip","phillip","normal","the","cool","charact","a","in","cruel","intent","and","wai","of","the","gun","but","in","thi","he","suppos","to","be","a","bumbl","hero","which","he","attempt","to","portrai","by","slip","when","he","run","and","have","geeki","friend","but","he","just","doe","not","look","right","the","femal","star","rachel","leigh","cook","and","clare","forlani","do","not","featur","enough","but","when","thei","do","neither","of","the","perform","be","close","to","their","best","the","onli","highlight","of","the","film","be","tim","robbin","in","a","role","that","can","have","be","make","for","him","and","it","hi","fieri","temper","and","mysteri","wai","that","drag","the","film","along","the","final","point","be","that","thi","film","be","anoth","on","which","fill","the","trailer","with","scene","you","do","not","see","in","the","film","and","instead","featur","onli","in","the","delet","scene","section","of","the","dvd","caus","even","much","disappoint","a","although","some","of","thi","scene","be","crude","thei","do","fill","in","import","gap","in","the","stori"],"filtered":["see","trailer","thi","film","cinema","think","origin","concept","thriller","set","competit","world","comput","compani","star","cast","anoth","messag","thi","film","probabl","good","go","watch","week","releas","disappear","week","fear","someth","miss","patient","wait","dvd","releas","bui","rush","home","enjoy","even","view","anticip","wai","home","far","well","film","start","direct","appal","think","go","director","make","part","appear","film","rush","emploi","futur","secondli","lead","role","complet","miscast","ryan","phillip","phillip","normal","cool","charact","cruel","intent","wai","gun","thi","suppos","bumbl","hero","attempt","portrai","slip","run","geeki","friend","doe","look","right","femal","star","rachel","leigh","cook","clare","forlani","featur","enough","thei","neither","perform","close","best","onli","highlight","film","tim","robbin","role","make","hi","fieri","temper","mysteri","wai","drag","film","along","final","point","thi","film","anoth","fill","trailer","scene","see","film","instead","featur","onli","delet","scene","section","dvd","caus","even","much","disappoint","although","thi","scene","crude","thei","fill","import","gap","stori"],"filtered2":["see","trailer","cinema","think","origin","concept","thriller","set","competit","world","comput","compani","star","cast","anoth","messag","probabl","good","go","watch","week","releas","disappear","week","fear","someth","miss","patient","wait","dvd","releas","bui","rush","home","enjoy","even","view","anticip","wai","home","far","well","start","direct","appal","think","go","director","make","part","appear","rush","emploi","futur","secondli","lead","role","complet","miscast","ryan","phillip","phillip","normal","cool","charact","cruel","intent","wai","gun","suppos","bumbl","hero","attempt","portrai","slip","run","geeki","friend","doe","look","right","femal","star","rachel","leigh","cook","clare","forlani","featur","enough","neither","perform","close","best","onli","highlight","tim","robbin","role","make","fieri","temper","mysteri","wai","drag","along","final","point","anoth","fill","trailer","scene","see","instead","featur","onli","delet","scene","section","dvd","caus","even","disappoint","although","scene","crude","fill","import","gap","stori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,7,10,11,12,16,17,18,19,20,33,53,58,61,66,69,71,73,92,93,100,101,102,103,105,109,121,128,137,148,149,152,156,157,161,165,170,177,187,237,247,255,295,302,305,312,324,327,331,347,375,403,409,422,452,469,481,501,553,569,600,700,714,718,725,737,764,765,811,812,844,857,882,950,1203,1364,1385,1444,1541,1561,1793,1876,1914,1984,2229,2270,2293,2400,2478,2593,2668,2701,2746,3080,3389,3401,3687,4008,5649,6357,6363],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"My God. This movie was awful. I can't complain about it too much. I went to see it just to be grossed out. It did suffice, sort of. It's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very, very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby.<br /><br />I also think that it's funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the Hispanic soldier, who was a supporting actor in Next Friday. Everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job. It was some of the worst acting I've ever paid to see. <br /><br />I also expected that it would be much more gruesome than the first one. It wasn't. I expected it to be more gruesome because it's a sequel and horror movie sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors. I expected it to be more gruesome since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days (Grudge 2, Saw 3, Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, Dead Silence), but It actually wasn't nearly as gruesome as the first one, which was yet another disappointment. <br /><br />The mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing but the filmmakers were trying so hard in this one to make them creepy that they were absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />I also hated the entire concept of showing the clip of the female soldier's son on her camera-phone saying \"I love you, mommy\" FOUR TIMES. It was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even WORSE for her by showing it three more times for no reason.

joke.","finished_norm":["my","god","thi","movi","be","aw","i","ca","not","complain","about","it","too","much","i","go","to","see","it","just","to","be","gross","out","it","do","suffic","sort","of","it","funni","that","the","much","disgust","part","of","the","movi","be","in","the","veri","veri","begin","where","the","woman","be","extrem","vividli","forc","to","give","birth","to","a","horribli","mutat","babybr","br","i","conjur","think","that","it","funni","that","the","much","notabl","actor","in","the","movi","be","the","hispan","soldier","who","be","a","support","actor","in","next","fridai","everyon","in","the","movi","do","a","horribl","act","job","it","be","some","of","the","wrong","act","i","have","ever","pai","to","see","br","br","i","conjur","expect","that","it","would","be","much","much","gruesom","than","the","on","it","be","not","i","expect","it","to","be","much","gruesom","becaus","it","a","sequel","and","horror","movi","sequel","be","usual","much","littl","success","than","their","predecessor","i","expect","it","to","be","much","gruesom","sinc","gore","and","violenc","usual","sell","a","horror","movi","thi","dai","grudg","see","jeeper","creeper","dead","silenc","but","it","actual","be","not","nearli","a","gruesom","a","the","on","which","be","yet","anoth","disappoint","br","br","the","mutant","in","the","on","be","kind","of","disturb","but","the","filmmak","be","try","so","hard","in","thi","on","to","make","them","creepi","that","thei","be","absolut","hilariousbr","br","i","conjur","hate","the","entir","concept","of","show","the","clip","of","the","femal","soldier","son","on","her","cameraphon","sai","i","love","you","mommi","four","time","it","be","stupid","to","show","it","in","the","place","becaus","thei","be","just","try","to","make","u","feel","wrong","for","the","vulner","mother","than","the","rest","of","the","soldier","and","it","be","even","much","stupid","to","keep","try","to","make","u","feel","even","wrong","for","her","by","show","it","three","much","time","for","no","reason","thi","movi","be","a","joke"],"filtered":["god","thi","movi","aw","ca","complain","much","go","see","gross","suffic","sort","funni","much","disgust","part","movi","veri","veri","begin","woman","extrem","vividli","forc","give","birth","horribli","mutat","babybr","br","conjur","think","funni","much","notabl","actor","movi","hispan","soldier","support","actor","next","fridai","everyon","movi","horribl","act","job","wrong","act","ever","pai","see","br","br","conjur","expect","much","much","gruesom","expect","much","gruesom","becaus","sequel","horror","movi","sequel","usual","much","littl","success","predecessor","expect","much","gruesom","sinc","gore","violenc","usual","sell","horror","movi","thi","dai","grudg","see","jeeper","creeper","dead","silenc","actual","nearli","gruesom","yet","anoth","disappoint","br","br","mutant","kind","disturb","filmmak","try","hard","thi","make","creepi","thei","absolut","hilariousbr","br","conjur","hate","entir","concept","show","clip","femal","soldier","son","cameraphon","sai","love","mommi","four","time","stupid","show","place","becaus","thei","try","make","u","feel","wrong","vulner","mother","rest","soldier","even","much","stupid","keep","try","make","u","feel","even","wrong","show","three","much","time","reason","thi","movi","joke"],"filtered2":["god","aw","ca","complain","go","see","gross","suffic","sort","funni","disgust","part","veri","veri","begin","woman","extrem","vividli","forc","give","birth","horribli","mutat","babybr","conjur","think","funni","notabl","actor","hispan","soldier","support","actor","next","fridai","everyon","horribl","act","job","wrong","act","ever","pai","see","conjur","expect","gruesom","expect","gruesom","becaus","sequel","horror","sequel","usual","littl","success","predecessor","expect","gruesom","sinc","gore","violenc","usual","sell","horror","dai","grudg","see","jeeper","creeper","dead","silenc","actual","nearli","gruesom","yet","anoth","disappoint","mutant","kind","disturb","filmmak","try","hard","make","creepi","absolut","hilariousbr","conjur","hate","entir","concept","show","clip","femal","soldier","son","cameraphon","love","mommi","four","time","stupid","show","place","becaus","try","make","u","feel","wrong","vulner","mother","rest","soldier","even","stupid","keep","try","make","u","feel","even","wrong","show","three","time","reason","joke"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,6,8,12,14,15,21,22,25,28,30,36,39,41,43,44,52,54,61,62,70,73,81,83,95,112,122,130,132,134,136,138,147,162,164,171,187,194,198,214,222,224,226,228,230,246,265,269,289,297,322,323,329,338,339,352,358,387,397,422,434,453,459,532,606,611,657,725,755,839,861,963,1276,1563,1656,1676,1722,1823,2103,2307,2509,2854,3229,3357,3485,3631,5124,5234,6031,7477,7958],"values":[3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"A family looking for some old roadside attractions to include in the father's coffee-table book come across an ancient, decrepit old freak show run by an eccentric one-eyed man. When their family van breaks down upon leaving the sideshow, they're forced to stay at a nearly abandoned fishing camp that was the site of a prison break decades prior.<br /><br />There have been many films in the 'freak' subgenre of horror, ranging from Tod Browning's beloved 'Freaks' (1932) to Alex Winter's hilarious 'Freaked' (1993). Those are both classics (or soon-to-be with 'Freaked'). 'Side Sho,' however, never will be. And if it ever does reach classic status. . . well, it will be an obvious clue to the sad state of our genre. From the ridiculously bad opening song to the 17-year-old daughter that's obviously older than her natural mother, this film did not have much going for it. The writing was subpar, but not completely awful. . . just boring. The direction was poor, and the rare freak effects were pretty horrendous and unbelievable. The acting was abysmal and the casting was even worse. Anyone who would believe the ages of these two camp-age teenagers must not have met a teenager in a long, long time. There was far from enough gore & violence to make up for the lack of any other quality. . . and when there was a bit of violence, it was not well done at all. And, I can't forget to mention the ending fight scenes which were, with all honesty, some of the worst I've ever, ever seen in a film. Overall, this is an easily forgettable and poorly made horror film that deserves to be left alone at the bottom of the dollar bin.<br /><br />Final verdict: 2.5/10.","finished_norm":["a","famili","look","for","some","old","roadsid","attract","to","includ","in","the","father","coffeet","book","come","across","a","ancient","decrepit","old","freak","show","run","by","a","eccentr","oneei","man","when","their","famili","van","break","down","upon","leav","the","sideshow","thei","re","forc","to","stai","at","a","nearli","abandon","fish","camp","that","be","the","site","of","a","prison","break","decad","priorbr","br","there","have","be","mani","film","in","the","freak","subgenr","of","horror","rang","from","tod","brown","belov","freak","to","alex","winter","hilari","freak","that","be","both","classic","or","soontob","with","freak","side","sho","howev","never","will","be","and","if","it","ever","doe","reach","classic","statu","good","it","will","be","a","obviou","clue","to","the","sad","state","of","our","genr","from","the","ridicul","bad","open","song","to","the","yearold","daughter","that","obvious","old","than","her","natur","mother","thi","film","do","not","have","much","go","for","it","the","write","be","subpar","but","not","complet","aw","just","bore","the","direct","be","poor","and","the","rare","freak","effect","be","pretti","horrend","and","unbeliev","the","act","be","abysm","and","the","cast","be","even","wrong","anyon","who","would","believ","the","ag","of","thi","two","campag","teenag","must","not","have","meet","a","teenag","in","a","long","long","time","there","be","far","from","enough","gore","violenc","to","make","up","for","the","lack","of","ani","other","qualiti","and","when","there","be","a","bite","of","violenc","it","be","not","good","do","at","all","and","i","ca","not","forget","to","mention","the","end","fight","scene","which","be","with","all","honesti","some","of","the","wrong","i","have","ever","ever","see","in","a","film","overal","thi","be","a","easili","forgett","and","poorli","make","horror","film","that","deserv","to","be","leav","alon","at","the","bottom","of","the","dollar","binbr","br","final","verdict"],"filtered":["famili","look","old","roadsid","attract","includ","father","coffeet","book","come","across","ancient","decrepit","old","freak","show","run","eccentr","oneei","man","famili","van","break","upon","leav","sideshow","thei","re","forc","stai","nearli","abandon","fish","camp","site","prison","break","decad","priorbr","br","mani","film","freak","subgenr","horror","rang","tod","brown","belov","freak","alex","winter","hilari","freak","classic","soontob","freak","side","sho","howev","never","ever","doe","reach","classic","statu","good","obviou","clue","sad","state","genr","ridicul","bad","open","song","yearold","daughter","obvious","old","natur","mother","thi","film","much","go","write","subpar","complet","aw","bore","direct","poor","rare","freak","effect","pretti","horrend","unbeliev","act","abysm","cast","even","wrong","anyon","believ","ag","thi","two","campag","teenag","must","meet","teenag","long","long","time","far","enough","gore","violenc","make","lack","ani","qualiti","bite","violenc","good","ca","forget","mention","end","fight","scene","honesti","wrong","ever","ever","see","film","overal","thi","easili","forgett","poorli","make","horror","film","deserv","leav","alon","bottom","dollar","binbr","br","final","verdict"],"filtered2":["famili","look","old","roadsid","attract","includ","father","coffeet","book","come","across","ancient","decrepit","old","freak","show","run","eccentr","oneei","man","famili","van","break","upon","leav","sideshow","re","forc","stai","nearli","abandon","fish","camp","site","prison","break","decad","priorbr","mani","freak","subgenr","horror","rang","tod","brown","belov","freak","alex","winter","hilari","freak","classic","soontob","freak","side","sho","howev","never","ever","doe","reach","classic","statu","good","obviou","clue","sad","state","genr","ridicul","bad","open","song","yearold","daughter","obvious","old","natur","mother","go","write","subpar","complet","aw","bore","direct","poor","rare","freak","effect","pretti","horrend","unbeliev","act","abysm","cast","even","wrong","anyon","believ","ag","two","campag","teenag","must","meet","teenag","long","long","time","far","enough","gore","violenc","make","lack","ani","qualiti","bite","violenc","good","ca","forget","mention","end","fight","scene","honesti","wrong","ever","ever","see","overal","easili","forgett","poorli","make","horror","deserv","leav","alon","bottom","dollar","binbr","final","verdict"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,8,9,16,18,19,21,24,25,27,28,34,42,44,45,47,50,65,67,68,74,78,81,83,91,92,93,99,101,102,103,106,108,113,137,138,141,146,151,154,156,158,182,183,233,242,274,285,301,319,328,332,338,341,343,350,358,360,366,372,383,397,398,412,423,425,426,442,453,455,456,457,467,498,503,571,583,611,630,632,648,693,818,852,860,908,934,1013,1038,1045,1196,1313,1391,1486,1511,1554,1620,1645,1681,1690,1723,1953,2021,2102,2489,2629,2924,3462,3794,4516,5385],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"This story is about the romantic triangle between a nth. African male prostitute, a French transsexual prostitute (Stephanie) and a Russian waiter who speaks no French and never seems to shave.<br /><br />As a film it is dull, dreary and depressing, shot either on foggy, overcast winter days or in badly lit interiors, where everyone is bathed in a weird blue luminescence. And yes, I know, it's because the white balance was out. Everyone is pale and downcast and looks haggard, shabby and dirty. Bodies are bony and shot in such closeup that they look quite ugly and unappealing. Moles, greasy hair. Yuk. Bad news in a film where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex.<br /><br />And the story? Well, Stephanie's mother is dying. All three characters go back to Stephanie's home village where, through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably dingy interiors, we see a bit of Stephanie's childhood as a boy called Pierre. The mother dies. Well... and that's about it, really. Character development is kept to a minimum, as is the denouement of the story. <br /><br />I suppose the storyline is not linear (it would explain a lot of non sequiteurs) but really, after paying my seven euros I don't feel like having to construct the film myself: that's what the director takes my money for. To expect me to join the story telling process and get my hands dirty, so to speak, is asking way too much.<br /><br />This film is a heap of pretentious rubbish made, above all, from a desire to epater les bourgeois (ie shock the straights). I can see how it was a shoo-in for the Berlin Film Festival, and I can see why it got nowhere.","finished_norm":["thi","stori","be","about","the","romant","triangl","between","a","nth","african","male","prostitut","a","french","transsexu","prostitut","stephani","and","a","russian","waiter","who","speak","no","french","and","never","seem","to","shavebr","br","a","a","film","it","be","dull","dreari","and","depress","shoot","either","on","foggi","overcast","winter","dai","or","in","badli","light","interior","where","everyon","be","bath","in","a","weird","blue","luminesc","and","ye","i","know","it","becaus","the","white","balanc","be","out","everyon","be","pale","and","downcast","and","look","haggard","shabbi","and","dirti","bodi","be","boni","and","shoot","in","such","closeup","that","thei","look","quit","ugli","and","unapp","mole","greasi","hair","yuk","bad","new","in","a","film","where","peopl","spend","a","lot","of","time","either","nake","or","have","sexbr","br","and","the","stori","good","stephani","mother","be","dye","all","three","charact","go","back","to","stephani","home","villag","where","through","a","bunch","of","flashback","to","desol","countrysid","and","predict","dingi","interior","we","see","a","bite","of","stephani","childhood","a","a","boi","call","pierr","the","mother","die","good","and","that","about","it","realli","charact","develop","be","keep","to","a","minimum","a","be","the","denouem","of","the","stori","br","br","i","suppos","the","storylin","be","not","linear","it","would","explain","a","lot","of","non","sequiteur","but","realli","after","pai","my","seven","euro","i","do","not","feel","like","have","to","construct","the","film","myself","that","what","the","director","take","my","monei","for","to","expect","me","to","join","the","stori","tell","process","and","get","my","hand","dirti","so","to","speak","be","ask","wai","too","muchbr","br","thi","film","be","a","heap","of","pretenti","rubbish","make","abov","all","from","a","desir","to","epat","le","bourgeoi","ie","shock","the","straight","i","can","see","how","it","be","a","shooin","for","the","berlin","film","festiv","and","i","can","see","why","it","get","nowher"],"filtered":["thi","stori","romant","triangl","nth","african","male","prostitut","french","transsexu","prostitut","stephani","russian","waiter","speak","french","never","seem","shavebr","br","film","dull","dreari","depress","shoot","either","foggi","overcast","winter","dai","badli","light","interior","everyon","bath","weird","blue","luminesc","ye","know","becaus","white","balanc","everyon","pale","downcast","look","haggard","shabbi","dirti","bodi","boni","shoot","closeup","thei","look","quit","ugli","unapp","mole","greasi","hair","yuk","bad","new","film","peopl","spend","lot","time","either","nake","sexbr","br","stori","good","stephani","mother","dye","three","charact","go","back","stephani","home","villag","bunch","flashback","desol","countrysid","predict","dingi","interior","see","bite","stephani","childhood","boi","call","pierr","mother","die","good","realli","charact","develop","keep","minimum","denouem","stori","br","br","suppos","storylin","linear","explain","lot","non","sequiteur","realli","pai","seven","euro","feel","like","construct","film","director","take","monei","expect","join","stori","tell","process","get","hand","dirti","speak","ask","wai","muchbr","br","thi","film","heap","pretenti","rubbish","make","abov","desir","epat","le","bourgeoi","ie","shock","straight","see","shooin","berlin","film","festiv","see","get","nowher"],"filtered2":["stori","romant","triangl","nth","african","male","prostitut","french","transsexu","prostitut","stephani","russian","waiter","speak","french","never","seem","shavebr","dull","dreari","depress","shoot","either","foggi","overcast","winter","dai","badli","light","interior","everyon","bath","weird","blue","luminesc","ye","know","becaus","white","balanc","everyon","pale","downcast","look","haggard","shabbi","dirti","bodi","boni","shoot","closeup","look","quit","ugli","unapp","mole","greasi","hair","yuk","bad","new","peopl","spend","lot","time","either","nake","sexbr","stori","good","stephani","mother","dye","three","charact","go","back","stephani","home","villag","bunch","flashback","desol","countrysid","predict","dingi","interior","see","bite","stephani","childhood","boi","call","pierr","mother","die","good","realli","charact","develop","keep","minimum","denouem","stori","suppos","storylin","linear","explain","lot","non","sequiteur","realli","pai","seven","euro","feel","like","construct","director","take","monei","expect","join","stori","tell","process","get","hand","dirti","speak","ask","wai","muchbr","heap","pretenti","rubbish","make","abov","desir","epat","le","bourgeoi","ie","shock","straight","see","shooin","berlin","festiv","see","get","nowher"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,8,9,10,13,16,17,22,23,26,31,33,35,42,43,58,63,72,87,90,117,120,126,130,132,134,142,149,154,207,209,224,235,246,282,283,293,302,306,320,322,337,344,353,359,367,376,395,397,419,448,508,515,548,625,649,704,799,813,8

{"value":"Oh, dear lord.... They've turned what was a fairly thought provoking movie into a swaggering testosterone fest.<br /><br />The original 1971 version of this movie was beautifully vague about our hero Kowalski. He was a man trying to drive from Denver to San Fransisco to win a bet. Why was he willing to risk his life for the price of a handful of uppers? We're not really sure.<br /><br />We had a few flashbacks that gave us the picture that he was an adrenaline junkie, and presumably he had led his entire life trying to make it to the vanishing point. That point you see off in the distance where the left and right shoulders of the road come together, and the road itself vanishes. He lives only to be free, and means no ill on anyone. We saw several times when there were accidents he stopped to make sure the other driver was okay before moving on, even the cops that were chasing him.<br /><br />When he saw the futility of his quest he took his life rather than be arrested and live a life of captivity. He died like he lived, running wide open.<br /><br />In the remake Kowalski has a whole history (including a first name, even.) He's trying to get to the hospital where his wife is suffering from complications to her pregnancy. He is a devoted husband, and excited expectant father. He comes to the decision to take his life after hearing his wife died in delivery, but they even leave THAT in question when they suggest that he may have jumped out of the car before it ran into the bulldozers.

{"value":"\"This story is dedicated to women,\" according to the introduction, \"who have been fighting for their rights ever since Adam and Eve started the loose-leaf system.\" When \"Politics\" was filmed, the Nineteenth Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote, was only a decade old. And, the film deals with the wielding of political power by women as a voting group. Advocating prohibition, and shutting down speakeasies, was a main concern for women at the time.<br /><br />Good-natured Marie Dressler (as Hattie Burns) becomes politically active, after a young woman is shot and killed coming out of a speakeasy. She wants the liquor-selling joints closed; and, is drafted into a Mayoral run, after delivering a powerful speech at a women's rally. Ms. Dressler is supported by her tenants, best friend Polly Moran (as Ivy Higgins) and her stuttering husband Roscoe Ates (as Peter Higgins). Dressler's run for Mayor of Lake City draws opposition from men in town; so, Dressler orders the women to go on strike, denying them, \"everything\" in the \"parlor, bedroom, and bath.\" <br /><br />The film sounds much better than it turned out. The humor, frankly, isn't too good; and, it features some unfunny and moderately offensive situations (\"You look like Madame Queen\" refers to an Amos and Andy character). And, the mixing of shootings and slapstick doesn't mix well, this time.

{"value":"Detective Russell Logan(Lou Diamond Phillips)has a major problem on his hands. The serial killer, Patrick Channing(Jeff Kober), for whom psychic extraordinaire Tess(Tracy Griffith)helped him capture, has been resurrected with The First Power(..given to him by Satan after his execution in the gas chamber)and can possess the bodies of the weak. Somehow, Russell, who joins forces with Tess(..who has an understanding of what they are up against), will have to stop Channing or many women will continue to die at his bloody hands. They will seek help from Sister Marguerite(Elizabeth Arlen)who has tried to inform her superiors in the Catholic church of The First Power, but has been denied access to a weapon that can stop Channing..a cross with a blade that can penetrate the heart of Channing ridding the world of his evil. She'll take it anyway and lend a helping hand to Russell, who'll need all the help he can get when Channing kidnaps Tess preparing her for some sort of Satanic ritual/ceremony.<br /><br />In the film, Mykelti Williamson, always a reliable welcome supporting actor, gets the partner of Russell role..so you know what will happen to him. As in films of this type, everyone around Russell is dying, but when he attempts to kill Channing, he's merely murdering the weak host of some other poor soul he possesses.<br /><br />Pure occult rubbish..stupid from the gate to the finish line. Phillips and Griffith try, I'll give them that, but in a flick like this they don't stand a chance. Kober, who is normally often always effective as the heavy, is really handed nothing more than a goofy villain who leaps in the air and tosses rotten

{"value":"I've been largely convinced to write this review for a number of reasons:<br /><br />1) This is, without doubt, the worst film i've ever seen 2) Unless it gets more reviews it will not be listed in the all time worst films list - which it deserves to be 3) I was kinda lucky - i paid five pound for it. i've seen it in shops for 15 pound. DON NOT PAY THAT MUCH FOR THIS FILM! You will be very angry 4) There are a lot of films out there in the horror genre that are not given a fair rating (in my opinion) and giving this film a higher rating than them is criminal<br /><br />The plot summary: a guy with no friends meets a tramp who promises the world - well, the magic ability to appear to everybody else like somebody else. Our hero cunningly turns into a teenage girl and joins their gang - sitting on swings, baby-sitting. He kills them one by one until he is tracked and found by the police.<br /><br />Why is it so bad? To begin with the acting is VERY VERY bad. Someone else compared it to a school production. No, this is worse than any acting i've seen on a school stage.<br /><br />I've bought a number of these previously banned films from the DVD company vipco and not been as disappointed as i was at this. okay, the acting is bad but the film fails to deliver in every other sense. What was the point in making this film when there isn't even any gore! okay, no gore. What else can a film like this offer? Breats?

{"value":"Worst show I've ever seen. The story is about a group of teenagers who, for some inexplicable reason, have super powers, and when they use some special device, they morph into strange, poorly designed suits. The acting when they're not in the retarded-looking suits is decent. Definitely not good, but not the worst acting I've ever seen. However, when wearing their suits, the actors' acting goes from bad to worse; much, much worse. The hyper-animated idiots have a myriad of unnecessary motions they do. Even when they talk they look like they're having seizures. The villains are stupider than the Rangers. Every episode, some weak, idiotic villain comes up with some plan to destroy the Rangers. He/she then sends a force of hyper-animated aliens to attack the Rangers. The Rangers then initialize their 10-hour transforming animation, then they annihilate the aliens. Then, the poorly designed villain, which can either be an armored villain that actually looks and acts evil, to a humanoid ladybug-like creature with trumpets attached to its back that shows obvious signs of mental retardation. The Power Rangers fight the villain off, then the villain turns into Godzilla, whether it be by a rain cloud or a nuclear missile (yes, they fire nukes at the creatures and the creatures turn into giants). The Power Rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyper-animated and summon their Zords which are obviously toys that the producers of the show used special effects on to make them look real. The Power Rangers win, the villain gets mad, they all teach a \"valuable\" lesson, and the show ends. That's it.

{"value":"This film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in California. She thought it was wonderful because it was so real, \"Just the way people in the Ohio Valley are!\" I'm from the area and I experienced the film as \"Just the way people in California think we are!\" I've lived in Marietta and Parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there. We laughed a lot, we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age; the young people went out together at night. The older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families. The area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else.<br /><br />Aside from the \"if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed\" condescension, the story lacked any elements of charm, mystery or even a sense of dread.<br /><br />Martha's character was the worst drawn. It's doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church, but if she had, she probably would have made friends there. I've read reviews that seem to assume Martha was jealous of Rose because Rose was \"younger, prettier and thinner\" but if this is the case it isn't shown. All we actually see is Martha learning to dislike Rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender. We see Martha feeling left out during smoking sessions, left out of the loop when social plans are made, used but not appreciated, and finally disrespected and hurt.<br /><br />Just one more thing: Are we supposed to suspect Kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks?

{"value":"A yawn-inducing, snail-paced disappointment, Inside Man tells the story of a detective (Denzel Washington) who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money. When a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief (Clive Owen) and his team, the detective is assigned to coerce the thief to surrender  his one shot at proving he is innocent and worthy of his position. Enter a powerful woman (Jodie Foster) with secrets and intents of her own, sent to recover an item from the bank owner's safety deposit box that is stored within the bank, and you have quite the three-way dilemma. Unfortunately, all you get it set-up in the film, and nothing pays off in the end. Denzel Washington is at his most uninteresting in an ineffective and distastefully egocentric performance. The only saving grace for the film is its competent co-stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen, who are much better than the film itself. In fact, Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and high-caliber performance playing against type as a ruthless, cutthroat villain of sorts. Clive Owen isn't given much to do besides brood and pose, but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role. It's strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest. You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking while he was creating this film. The most perplexing aspect of Inside Man, however, is how much unwarranted praise it has received. For a film that seemed to have all the makings of a pre-summer blockbuster, this one falls horribly flat.","finished_norm":["a","yawninduc","snailpac","disappoint","insid","man","tell","the","stori","of","a","detect","denzel","washington","who","be","under","investig","due","to","hi","possibl","involv","in","a","case","of","miss","monei","when","a","bank","be","rob","and","hostag","be","hold","against","their","will","by","a","mastermind","thief","clive","owen","and","hi","team","the","detect","be","assign","to","coerc","the","thief","to","surrend","hi","on","shoot","at","prove","he","be","innoc","and","worthi","of","hi","posit","enter","a","power","woman","jodi","foster","with","secret","and","intent","of","her","own","send","to","recov","a","item","from","the","bank","owner","safeti","deposit","box","that","be","store","within","the","bank","and","you","have","quit","the","threewai","dilemma","unfortun","all","you","get","it","setup","in","the","film","and","noth","pai","off","in","the","end","denzel","washington","be","at","hi","much","uninterest","in","a","ineffect","and","distastefulli","egocentr","perform","the","onli","save","grace","for","the","film","be","it","compet","costar","jodi","foster","and","clive","owen","who","be","much","well","than","the","film","itself","in","fact","jodi","foster","deliv","the","much","surpris","and","highcalib","perform","plai","against","typ","a","a","ruthless","cutthroat","villain","of","sort","clive","owen","be","not","give","much","to","do","besid","brood","and","pose","but","the","depth","of","hi","presenc","and","hi","achiev","act","abil","much","than","make","up","for","hi","underdevelop","role","it","strang","that","so","much","talent","be","wast","on","thi","film","of","littl","impact","or","interest","you","have","to","wonder","what","director","spike","lee","be","think","while","he","be","creat","thi","film","the","much","perplex","aspect","of","insid","man","howev","be","how","much","unwarr","prais","it","have","receiv","for","a","film","that","seem","to","have","all","the","make","of","a","presumm","blockbust","thi","on","fall","horribli","flat"],"filtered":["yawninduc","snailpac","disappoint","insid","man","tell","stori","detect","denzel","washington","investig","due","hi","possibl","involv","case","miss","monei","bank","rob","hostag","hold","mastermind","thief","clive","owen","hi","team","detect","assign","coerc","thief","surrend","hi","shoot","prove","innoc","worthi","hi","posit","enter","power","woman","jodi","foster","secret","intent","send","recov","item","bank","owner","safeti","deposit","box","store","within","bank","quit","threewai","dilemma","unfortun","get","setup","film","noth","pai","end","denzel","washington","hi","much","uninterest","ineffect","distastefulli","egocentr","perform","onli","save","grace","film","compet","costar","jodi","foster","clive","owen","much","well","film","fact","jodi","foster","deliv","much","surpris","highcalib","perform","plai","typ","ruthless","cutthroat","villain","sort","clive","owen","give","much","besid","brood","pose","depth","hi","presenc","hi","achiev","act","abil","much","make","hi","underdevelop","role","strang","much","talent","wast","thi","film","littl","impact","interest","wonder","director","spike","lee","think","creat","thi","film","much","perplex","aspect","insid","man","howev","much","unwarr","prais","receiv","film","seem","make","presumm","blockbust","thi","fall","horribli","flat"],"filtered2":["yawninduc","snailpac","disappoint","insid","man","tell","stori","detect","denzel","washington","investig","due","possibl","involv","case","miss","monei","bank","rob","hostag","hold","mastermind","thief","clive","owen","team","detect","assign","coerc","thief","surrend","shoot","prove","innoc","worthi","posit","enter","power","woman","jodi","foster","secret","intent","send","recov","item","bank","owner","safeti","deposit","box","store","within","bank","quit","threewai","dilemma","unfortun","get","setup","noth","pai","end","denzel","washington","uninterest","ineffect","distastefulli","egocentr","perform","onli","save","grace","compet","costar","jodi","foster","clive","owen","well","fact","jodi","foster","deliv","surpris","highcalib","perform","plai","typ","ruthless","cutthroat","villain","sort","clive","owen","give","besid","brood","pose","depth","presenc","achiev","act","abil","make","underdevelop","role","strang","talent","wast","littl","impact","interest","wonder","director","spike","lee","think","creat","perplex","aspect","insid","man","howev","unwarr","prais","receiv","seem","make","presumm","blockbust","fall","horribli","flat"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,11,12,14,17,20,21,24,30,35,40,45,49,58,60,70,89,90,97,105,113,117,120,126,128,169,175,187,189,227,241,255,269,276,288,322,326,362,365,384,402,414,417,509,517,520,540,568,570,593,645,654,672,721,723,793,798,811,847,890,914,972,1031,1062,1113,1149,1153,1159,1164,1170,1247,1265,1276,1337,1361,1553,1653,1680,1774,1795,1939,1985,2014,2194,2401,2462,2591,2702,2986,3104,3410,3527,3649,3840,4168,4178,4354,4632,4816,4899,5155,5453,6087,6229

{"value":"Ahh, the dull t.v. shows and pilots that were slammed together in the 70's to make equally dull t.v. movies! Some examples would be Riding With Death(the most hysterically cheesy of the lot), Stranded in Space(confusing and uninteresting), San Francisco International(horribly dull and unbelievably confusing), and this turgid bit of Quinn Martin glamor. <br /><br />Shot in Hawaii(although you wouldn't know it from the outside shots), it's apparently a failed pilot for a lame spy show. The real problem is that you don;'t like most of the characters, including the drab main character Diamond Head, who seemed half asleep for the entire movie; his boss 'Aunt Mary', who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on; Diamnd Head's girlfriend/fellow agent(hell, I can't even remember her name) a skinny, wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting; and the singing sidekick Zulu(again, i can't remember his character's name)who wasn't bad in small doses. The most interesting person in the whole production was Ian McShane, who sucked as a bad guy but still proved his acting chops. Alothugh the make-up jobs this so-called 'chameleon' used to disguise himself were just laughable. I have absolutely no idea what he was doing or what he was trying to steal from the lab that caused him to dress as a South American Dictator cum American General. Nor do I care. The plot simply wasn't interesting enough to hold your attention for even ten minutes at a time, let alone the hour and a half or so it goes on.

{"value":"Wow, not only is this film a \"new lesson in real bad taste,\" but also a lesson in \"real bad film making.\" Don't get me wrong, I appreciated the concept of 'Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence,' but at the same time one must realize when a movie is terrible. In case you missed out on the storyline, the plot of 'Zombie '90' is about a government plane carrying toxic chemicals that so happens to crash into the wilderness, causing the chemicals to spill, turning locals into hideous looking zombies. The next thing you know, zombies are all over the city eating people alive, while a goofy-looking doctor and a government agent are trying to figure out the disease that's making these people eat one another - hence the name \"Extreme Pestilence.\" From then on, all we see is zombies having a field day on every local in sight - nothing but extreme and sickening disembowelments and dismemberments accompanied by endless buckets of guts and gore. Since this is a German film, the film had to be dubbed into English and when you're not laughing at the feeding frenzies of the zombies, the voice-overs are quite hilarious and entertaining as well. As user UnratedX mentioned *SPOILER* *SPOILER* *SPOILER*, there is a scene in the film that crosses the line between what's acceptable and not acceptable, hence the scene in which a woman, who is carrying her infant baby, is being wheeled around in her wheelchair by some dude and a horde of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them.

{"value":"<br /><br />Once I ignored some of the implausibilities, this was actually a fairly decent horror/monster flick. So, I'll give some of the good points first: - the dragon was quite convincing, especially as she prowled through the tunnels looking for lunch (hint: she likes humans). - the action was fairly non stop, and, after a weak beginning, I got quite absorbed in the storyline. - sorry to say, I was kind of rooting for the dragon - she was probably the most convincing and consistent character in the movie.<br /><br />Now for the implausible stuff **maybe some spoilers**: - if you were hunting a fire-breathing dragon in 1100 AD, would you charge into its cave with a barrel of gunpowder under your arm? Duh. - a female character with an all-American name, blonde hair and obvious Slavic accent, trying to pretend she's Spanish? Huh? - a lead scientist whose Slavic accent you can cut with a knife, and he's supposedly born in Chicago, educated in USA? - a military helicopter pilot who does his own repairs, flies a huge transport copter with no other crew, and is an expert marksman and combat soldier to boot? OK. Uh huh. I won't even mention his giving 3 different call signs in 2 minutes while communicating with his base.<br /><br />It's still better than some of the Japanese monster flicks from the 60's, but not by much. If we're lucky, we won't see Dragon Fighter 2, though naturally the ending left that possibility wide open. Or, maybe, they'll hire a real director next time.<br /><br />In spite of everything, I gave this flick a 4 out of 10. Add 2 more if they rewrite the plot, and Dean Cain gets eaten in the first ten minutes.

{"value":"Although I had seen \"Gymkata\" in a theater way back in '85, I couldn't remember anything of the plot except for vague images of Kurt Thomas running and fighting against a backdrop of stone walls and disappointment regarding the ending.<br /><br />After reading some of the other reviews I picked up a copy of the newly released DVD to once again enter the world of Gymkata.<br /><br />It turns out this is one of those films produced during the '80s that would go directly to video today. The film stars champion gymnast Kurt Thomas as Jonathan Cabot, recruited out of the blue to infiltrate the nation of \"Parmistan\" to enter and hopefully win \"The Game,\" a suicidal bloodsport sponsored by the Khan who encourages his people by yelling what sounds like \"Yak Power.\" The goal of the mission involves the Star Wars defense system. Jonathan is trained in the martial arts by Princess Rubali, who never speaks or leaves the house. Once trained tries to blend in with the locals by wearing a bright red sweater with dashes of blue and white. Needless to say Cabot finds himself running and fighting for his life along the stone streets of Parmistan, on his way to a date with destiny, and the Game.<br /><br />Star, Kurt Thomas was ill served by director Robert Clouse, who it looks like was never on the set. The so called script is just this side of incompetent. See other reviews for the many howlers throughout. The town of crazies has a few good moments, but is ultimately ruined by bad editing. The ending...meh. Still there's the germ of a good action adventure here. A Hong Kong version with more visceral action and faster pace might even be pretty

{"value":"I know slashers are always supposed to be bad,but come on,what the hell is this?It's like a bunch of 10-year-olds saved their lunch money and started filming this by the end of their week.<br /><br />Anyway,six young people all go to the same house to get killed off screen.We have the brainy one,the slut,the other slut,the black guy,the killer,stereotypes like that.After one gets eaten by a shaking boat,the others all get stalked by some guy who wears a mask the people at the poor box rejected.There's one pretty decent murder somewhere in the middle,but then it's back to even more boredom,and especially more false scares.Seriously,we actually know it can't be the killer when a person gets attacked because the guy sure loves to take his sweet time for everything.<br /><br />After every character you expected to die dies,the standard ugly blonde chick and her soon-to-be-boyfriend eventually get captured by the killer(they get like,pushed down and then faint)and the killer reveals himself.I think the writers of this movie just took a blindfold and a pen and put it somewhere on the list of characters.The motive is just lame and don't even get me started on the damn secret.The killer then of course takes way too much time to explain everything(and then about ten minutes extra in which he slices up his own arm for some reason)and eventually gets overpowered by a guy with a gun.Hey,no fair!<br /><br />Really one of the most awful movies I've ever seen.I could enjoy myself more by watching a Lindsay Lohan-movie,I swear.I mean sure,most 80's slashers sucked as well but at least they threw in some T&A.This movie just has nothing going for it.","finished_norm":["i","know","slasher","be","alwai","suppos","to","be","badbut","come","onwhat","the","hell","be","thisit","like","a","bunch","of","yearold","save","their","lunch","monei","and","start","film","thi","by","the","end","of","their","weekbr","br","anywaysix","young","peopl","all","go","to","the","same","hous","to","get","kill","off","screenw","have","the","braini","oneth","slutth","other","slutth","black","guyth","killerstereotyp","like","thataft","on","get","eat","by","a","shake","boatth","other","all","get","stalk","by","some","gui","who","wear","a","mask","the","peopl","at","the","poor","box","rejectedther","on","pretti","decent","murder","somewher","in","the","middlebut","then","it","back","to","even","much","boredomand","especi","much","fals","scaresseriouslyw","actual","know","it","ca","not","be","the","killer","when","a","person","get","attack","becaus","the","gui","sure","love","to","take","hi","sweet","time","for","everythingbr","br","after","everi","charact","you","expect","to","die","diesth","standard","ugli","blond","chick","and","her","soontobeboyfriend","eventu","get","captur","by","the","killerthei","get","likepush","down","and","then","faintand","the","killer","reveal","himselfi","think","the","writer","of","thi","movi","just","take","a","blindfold","and","a","pen","and","put","it","somewher","on","the","list","of","charactersth","motiv","be","just","lame","and","do","not","even","get","me","start","on","the","damn","secretth","killer","then","of","cours","take","wai","too","much","time","to","explain","everythingand","then","about","ten","minut","extra","in","which","he","slice","up","hi","own","arm","for","some","reasonand","eventu","get","overpow","by","a","gui","with","a","gunheyno","fairbr","br","realli","on","of","the","much","aw","movi","i","have","ever","seeni","can","enjoi","myself","much","by","watch","a","lindsai","lohanmoviei","sweari","mean","suremost","slasher","suck","a","good","but","at","littl","thei","throw","in","some","tathi","movi","just","have","noth","go","for","it"],"filtered":["know","slasher","alwai","suppos","badbut","come","onwhat","hell","thisit","like","bunch","yearold","save","lunch","monei","start","film","thi","end","weekbr","br","anywaysix","young","peopl","go","hous","get","kill","screenw","braini","oneth","slutth","slutth","black","guyth","killerstereotyp","like","thataft","get","eat","shake","boatth","get","stalk","gui","wear","mask","peopl","poor","box","rejectedther","pretti","decent","murder","somewher","middlebut","back","even","much","boredomand","especi","much","fals","scaresseriouslyw","actual","know","ca","killer","person","get","attack","becaus","gui","sure","love","take","hi","sweet","time","everythingbr","br","everi","charact","expect","die","diesth","standard","ugli","blond","chick","soontobeboyfriend","eventu","get","captur","killerthei","get","likepush","faintand","killer","reveal","himselfi","think","writer","thi","movi","take","blindfold","pen","put","somewher","list","charactersth","motiv","lame","even","get","start","damn","secretth","killer","cours","take","wai","much","time","explain","everythingand","ten","minut","extra","slice","hi","arm","reasonand","eventu","get","overpow","gui","gunheyno","fairbr","br","realli","much","aw","movi","ever","seeni","enjoi","much","watch","lindsai","lohanmoviei","sweari","mean","suremost","slasher","suck","good","littl","thei","throw","tathi","movi","noth","go"],"filtered2":["know","slasher","alwai","suppos","badbut","come","onwhat","hell","thisit","like","bunch","yearold","save","lunch","monei","start","end","weekbr","anywaysix","young","peopl","go","hous","get","kill","screenw","braini","oneth","slutth","slutth","black","guyth","killerstereotyp","like","thataft","get","eat","shake","boatth","get","stalk","gui","wear","mask","peopl","poor","box","rejectedther","pretti","decent","murder","somewher","middlebut","back","even","boredomand","especi","fals","scaresseriouslyw","actual","know","ca","killer","person","get","attack","becaus","gui","sure","love","take","sweet","time","everythingbr","everi","charact","expect","die","diesth","standard","ugli","blond","chick","soontobeboyfriend","eventu","get","captur","killerthei","get","likepush","faintand","killer","reveal","himselfi","think","writer","take","blindfold","pen","put","somewher","list","charactersth","motiv","lame","even","get","start","damn","secretth","killer","cours","take","wai","time","explain","everythingand","ten","minut","extra","slice","arm","reasonand","eventu","get","overpow","gui","gunheyno","fairbr","realli","aw","ever","seeni","enjoi","watch","lindsai","lohanmoviei","sweari","mean","suremost","slasher","suck","good","littl","throw","tathi","noth","go"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,13,14,22,23,24,26,31,33,34,44,49,52,54,55,59,63,71,76,78,81,85,88,119,126,130,135,138,146,149,153,159,189,197,199,200,213,229,252,267,273,287,293,309,310,373,394,395,419,421,495,514,545,599,601,616,654,716,7

{"value":"I had never heard of this one before the owner of my local DVD rental outlet mentioned it to me; being a 1980s horror flick with the notorious distinction of having been banned in the U.K., I decided to check it out. The film turned out be a dull, amateurish and ugly-looking ride; the sound recording is so poor that dialogue is unintelligible half of the time, whereas the acting gives new meaning to the word inept! <br /><br />What’s worse, the film follows the awfully tired formula of a trio of teenage girls being involved in an accident and finding themselves sheltered by a dysfunctional family living in remote surroundings. Soon, one of the girls goes to look for help and is never heard from again; another, still bed-ridden, is quickly disposed of (after being forgotten for most of the duration). The heroine is the one to interact the most with the three inhabitants of the house: a harridan of a bible-thumping mother (cue horrendous overacting), her repressed (and long-suffering) daughter, and the latter’s weirdo brother who occasionally appears on the scene to drool over the sleeping female guests.<br /><br />Often resorting to dinner-table reminiscences by the man-hating mother (as a means of filling in the dreary, to say nothing of unoriginal, backstory) and which invariably develop into mother-daughter sparring contests, the film does have one ace up its sleeve – the twist ending is as unexpected as it is ingenious, but it does little to remove the bad taste left in the mouth by the film (as much through the lameness of it all as the intermittent gore) or the

{"value":"Kim Basinger stars as Della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband, who gets into trouble while she's out at the local mall doing some last minute Christmas shopping. After placing a hastily scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper and sticking said paper in the windshield of a car that took up two parking spaces, she finds out the owners of the car are the Rainbow Coilition of villains comprising of a white guy, a Mexican, a Chinese guy & a black. They confront her about the note, cap a helpless security guard, and the chase is on. During the course of the film Della will go for hunted to hunter as she unleashes her inner Bronson.<br /><br />I found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller. The acting was good enough (except for a few scenes, the \"Why God why\" bit was cringe worthy in it's badness though) It comes undone a bit due to the sheer fact that the villains Della chases from/after are mind-numbingly stupid. If they hadn't had the intellect of any given \"Home Alone\" baddie, perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the meh reaction it evokes. The unbelievability factor I'm willing to overlook as both the director & one of the producers had part in bringing \"Shoot em up\" to the screen (a film which while throwing credibility out the window was immensely fun).

{"value":"Well! What can one say? Firstly, this adaptation is far too long at 4 hours, for the complexity (or lack of such) of the plot. The actors try really hard to make something of this film but there is too little content for the time available. Swayzee is really NOT a Quatermain character at all. After seeing Sean Connery's interpretation of the great man in \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\", Swayzee really does not make the grade. This chap with the winchester repeating rifle has none of the strength, stature, subtlety, or humour needed for the part, and is upstaged by everyone including the witch doctor, who incidentally seems from my point of view to be more convincing as an actor than the rest of the cast. Some of the vistas are pleasing but there are silly mistakes in the cinematography. For example. When the happy team arrive at the water hole in the middle of the desert, their tracks are visible down to the oasis, just waiting for them to walk in them. Climbing out of the mine leads to an exit (on the next shot) nothing like the exit seen from the passage they have climbed through, et cetera. I was waiting for Doug McClure to appear at any moment. In some ways I wish he had. <br /><br />The leader of the Russians pursuing Quatermain is a shoddily created stereotypical character who just shoots at everything. <br /><br />Swayzee does quite well as the sad father, returned to London, who is unable to obtain the custody of his son. Swayzee should stick to that sort of thing. He is not able to carry the part of a courageous gentleman with a stout heart, experience of life, and sense of fair play.<br /><br />4 out of 10.

{"value":"It saddens me to rate a movie with a lot of my favorite actors, locations and genres, i.e. Douglas, Sutherland, Washington, D.C. and political thriller, but 'The Sentinel' really hits a low. It's like they had a great idea up front, signed the right cast and had some great city shots and then took a holiday letting the remaining crew improvise the rest. And I wish I could blame it on yet another bland performance from Basinger (not only do I feel she's one of the worst actors in Hollywood, but I'm still steaming more than a decade later that she was the only one, and definitely the only bad actor in the film, to win an acting Oscar for 'L.A. Confidential.') But she wasn't the only problem. Sutherland, who I love as Jack Bauer on '24' once again playsJack. I miss his old 'A Time to Kill' or 'A Few Good Men' days. Douglas certainly took a hiatus from acting and phoned this one in. Plot: Someone, some Secret Service traitor, wants the President dead and Douglas is (haphazardly) being framed. Will someone believe him? Actually, no spoiler here: as quickly as they came up with that subplot half-way through, it's over before you know it. And why did someone(s) want the President dead? Is that to be revealed in the sequel? Too many plot holes, too many doors opened and never closed and too predictable 'The Sentinel' is. If you only see one movie a year, you may not know who the mole is, but anyone who's familiar with these types of movies or even just seen one 'Law & Order' episode you'll know in the first few frames. Was it terrible? Not really, the cinematography was good, and despite Sutherland playing Jack again, he's still got

{"value":"This is one of those topics I can relate to a little more than most people as I hate noise & have no idea how those in big cities, New York especially how people get any sleep at all! It astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days. The basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic. It's too bad that's about it. Tim Robbbins is decent although except for a couple of scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel looking Margarita Leiveva) he didn't seem to really be altogether there. My biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning & talented actress to boot, Margarita Levieva. She doesn't have a lot to do, but she is supermodel beautiful. Even when they are trying to make her look at more girl next door. It makes me sad that there can be people such as Paris Hilton & Kim Kardashian in the world w/no redeemable skills or talent, to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I didn't care for much of this film because the script isn't very good, but am glad I got to see some new talent. I hope that producers & directors think about Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in there big budget film. If they can make Megan Fox a star (c'mon she isn't that hot, & her acting \"talent\" is worse than made-for Disney channel TV shows) from 1 film, it should happen easily for her, as she is gorgeous & has talent! I'd recommend her changing her last name so we can pronounce it and make it more marketable. Here's hoping this makes her career, & if there is any justice she can pop up on some big summer movie or two in the next couple years.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","that","topic","i","can","relat","to","a","littl","much","than","much","peopl","a","i","hate","nois","have","no","idea","how","that","in","big","citi","new","york","especi","how","peopl","get","ani","sleep","at","all","it","astound","me","that","peopl","can","stand","all","the","nois","out","there","thi","dai","the","basic","plot","of","the","film","be","that","it","make","for","a","interest","topic","it","too","bad","that","about","it","tim","robbbin","be","decent","although","except","for","a","coupl","of","scene","especi","with","the","absolut","supermodel","look","margarita","leiveva","he","do","not","seem","to","realli","be","altogeth","there","my","big","hope","for","thi","film","be","that","cast","agent","will","see","the","absolut","stun","talent","actress","to","boot","margarita","levieva","she","doe","not","have","a","lot","to","do","but","she","be","supermodel","beauti","even","when","thei","be","try","to","make","her","look","at","much","girl","next","door","it","make","me","sad","that","there","can","be","peopl","such","a","pari","hilton","kim","kardashian","in","the","world","wno","redeem","skill","or","talent","to","have","much","fame","and","success","than","thi","talent","beauti","i","do","not","care","for","much","of","thi","film","becaus","the","script","be","not","veri","good","but","be","glad","i","get","to","see","some","new","talent","i","hope","that","produc","director","think","about","margarita","when","thei","ne","a","beauti","new","actress","to","be","in","there","big","budget","film","if","thei","can","make","megan","fox","a","star","c","mon","she","be","not","that","hot","her","act","talent","be","wrong","than","madefor","disnei","channel","tv","show","from","film","it","should","happen","easili","for","her","a","she","be","gorgeou","have","talent","i","have","recommend","her","chang","her","last","name","so","we","can","pronounc","it","and","make","it","much","market","here","hope","thi","make","her","career","if","there","be","ani","justic","she","can","pop","up","on","some","big","summer","movi","or","two","in","the","next","coupl","year"],"filtered":["thi","topic","relat","littl","much","much","peopl","hate","nois","idea","big","citi","new","york","especi","peopl","get","ani","sleep","astound","peopl","stand","nois","thi","dai","basic","plot","film","make","interest","topic","bad","tim","robbbin","decent","although","except","coupl","scene","especi","absolut","supermodel","look","margarita","leiveva","seem","realli","altogeth","big","hope","thi","film","cast","agent","see","absolut","stun","talent","actress","boot","margarita","levieva","doe","lot","supermodel","beauti","even","thei","try","make","look","much","girl","next","door","make","sad","peopl","pari","hilton","kim","kardashian","world","wno","redeem","skill","talent","much","fame","success","thi","talent","beauti","care","much","thi","film","becaus","script","veri","good","glad","get","see","new","talent","hope","produc","director","think","margarita","thei","ne","beauti","new","actress","big","budget","film","thei","make","megan","fox","star","c","mon","hot","act","talent","wrong","madefor","disnei","channel","tv","show","film","happen","easili","gorgeou","talent","recommend","chang","last","name","pronounc","make","much","market","hope","thi","make","career","ani","justic","pop","big","summer","movi","two","next","coupl","year"],"filtered2":["topic","relat","littl","peopl","hate","nois","idea","big","citi","new","york","especi","peopl","get","ani","sleep","astound","peopl","stand","nois","dai","basic","plot","make","interest","topic","bad","tim","robbbin","decent","although","except","coupl","scene","especi","absolut","supermodel","look","margarita","leiveva","seem","realli","altogeth","big","hope","cast","agent","see","absolut","stun","talent","actress","boot","margarita","levieva","doe","lot","supermodel","beauti","even","try","make","look","girl","next","door","make","sad","peopl","pari","hilton","kim","kardashian","world","wno","redeem","skill","talent","fame","success","talent","beauti","care","becaus","script","veri","good","glad","get","see","new","talent","hope","produc","director","think","margarita","ne","beauti","new","actress","big","budget","make","megan","fox","star","c","mon","hot","act","talent","wrong","madefor","disnei","channel","tv","show","happen","easili","gorgeou","talent","recommend","chang","last","name","pronounc","make","market","hope","make","career","ani","justic","pop","big","summer","two","next","coupl","year"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,9,12,13,14,15,16,18,19,21,22,23,25,27,28,32,35,36,47,57,58,60,72,77,82,84,87,92,94,100,110,123,132,143,144,165,172,181,205,222,232,237,253,256,261,267,276,278,286,297,298,309,325,339,355,377,455,511,532,583,595,634,666,728,732,827,838,841,903,952,976,1069,1115,1227,1243,1383,1424,1444,1501,1556,1611,1867,1883,1886,1972,2071,2574,3091,4049,4161,5744,6788],"values":[6.0,2.0,1.0,2.

{"value":"I suppose that any novel that's as much of a downer as Moby Dick would not find much favor with Depression era audiences who had enough of their own troubles. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a pure coincidence. <br /><br />In fact half of the film is a prequel to the main story as we know it, not that too much of it was kept for the film. We first meet Ahab Creely (he's got a last name and a brother) as one happy go lucky soul with two legs and intentions to marry Joan Bennett who is Father Mapple's daughter. That brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett.<br /><br />John Barrymore is Ahab in an over the top performance. Barrymore had not quite mastered the sound cinema and he gave out with all the silent era histrionics plus a stage voice that would have shaken the rafters of any movie theater this film was playing in.<br /><br />We see Ahab lose his leg to the great whale Moby Dick and I have to say the amputation scene was pretty gruesome. Of course this was all before the Code. Still I'm sure 1930 audiences shuddered.<br /><br />After that the story of Ahab's hunt for the whale that he thinks made him unsightly in Joan Bennett's eyes. That is not exactly Melville's motivation, in fact there are no women characters in Moby Dick as he wrote it.<br /><br />One of the things Melville did was invest the crew of Ahab's ship the Pequod with personalities. Other than Queequeg the cannibal harpooner the names are there, but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs might as well be Smith and Jones.<br /><br />I'd see this version of Moby Dick strictly for curiosity and nothing

{"value":"Despite a decent first season this series never came close to realizing its potential. Set as a prequel to the original \"Star Trek\" series it was doomed almost from the start by an executive producer, Rick Berman, who felt compelled to artificially limit and constrict the definition of what a \"Star Trek\" series could be (which made this futuristic show increasingly anachronistic from a dramatic standpoint). The actual show-runner, Brannon Braga, didn't help matters by his uninspired and tired rehashing of previous Trek episodes and careless disregard of the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully obvious early on that he was in it only for the paycheck). Never have I seen a series' that so consistently did a disservice to a cast of talented actors (Jolene Blaylock excepted)last so long. It is as if this entire series was produced in bubble existing outside the contemporary television landscape where the audience (even a Trekker audience) is more demanding and sophisticated in their dramatic wants and desires. Unfortunately it appears as if Berman and Braga have succeeded in convincing the higher ups at Paramount that \"Enterprise\" suffered from \"franchise fatigue\" and that its core audience was did not walk away but was driven off. Produce a quality offering that lives up to the high ideals and standards of its predecessors and they (the audience) will come.<br /><br />Simply put, In a TeeVee universe where we are given shows like \"Battlestar: Galactica\" and \"The Shield\" the powers-that-be must give the viewing public a \"Star Trek\" that measures up and is dramatically competitive. It is just that straightforward and

{"value":"Let's just say I had to suspend my disbelief less for Spiderman than I did for Hooligans. That is, to say, I have less of a problem believing Toby McGuire can stick to buildings than I do Elija Wood throwing down with toughs in Manchester. I won't get into specifics, as I don't want to write a spoiler, but the idea of grown, professional, British men getting into near death scraps every weekend is, well... funny. And this film is not. The fighting, the idea of fighting, is taken far too seriously. The gravity of the pugilism, the reverence with which the subject matter is treated becomes irritating, as it neither establishes or resolves the conflict. It seems as though the plot, with holes big enough to drive a Guiness truck through, has been slapped together with a contrived \"fish out of water\" theme so that viewers can gaze into Woods teary eyes as he learns how to become a man ie. hitting other young men of opposing football tastes with blunt objects and then running away as fast as he can. The characters are cartoonish, especially the Americans at Harvard. The character development and story line are telegraphed to the viewer throughout the picture. Unfortunately, the absurdity of the film doesn't reach its height until nearly the end, which by then you'll have spent nearly two hours of your life you are never getting back. Pick up \"The Football Factory\" or \"Fight Club\" instead of this corny, and disappointing dud.

{"value":"A student filmmaker enlists a B-grade actress (a delectably diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) to complete the horror film that her mother (a dreadfully dull Kylie Minogue!) tried to make 12 years ago. It's a curious plot choice to say the least, as any Aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors. The film has a curse on it, because Molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set. But she's back, because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the \"set.\" Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern \"slasher,\" but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, it rips half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. Lots of film-world name-dropping a la \"Scream\" (except it's Aussie name-dropping--Jane Campion...see how this isn't as funny) and lots of \"is this real or is this a movie\" a la \"New Nightmare.\" The editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are laughable, almost everything is bad about this. Fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at: \"Don't worry, we'll treat your house as if it were our own,\" to which he responds, \"that doesn't mean anything to me, you look like you live in a dump!\" Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough to not regret renting this one. \"You got any diet coke in here?\" (as she rides in the film professor's car) and \"Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu?\" (the first thing she mutters on the set) and \"Where the hell is my agent?\" (oh wait, that's what I was thinking for her.)","finished_norm":["a","student","filmmak","enlist","a","bgrade","actress","a","delect","divaish","molli","ringwald","to","complet","the","horror","film","that","her","mother","a","dreadfulli","dull","kyli","minogu","try","to","make","year","ago","it","a","curiou","plot","choic","to","sai","the","littl","a","ani","aussi","horror","fan","know","that","the","genr","be","sadli","lack","in","woman","director","the","film","have","a","curs","on","it","becaus","molli","have","to","kill","some","psycho","murder","on","the","origin","set","but","she","back","becaus","she","ne","the","exposur","unfortun","the","curs","be","still","there","and","peopl","start","dye","on","the","set","cut","be","a","aussi","attempt","at","the","modern","slasher","but","unfortun","it","doe","not","bring","anyth","new","or","excit","to","the","tabl","in","fact","it","rip","half","of","we","craven","filmographi","lot","of","filmworld","namedrop","a","la","scream","except","it","aussi","namedroppingjan","campionse","how","thi","be","not","a","funni","and","lot","of","be","thi","real","or","be","thi","a","movi","a","la","new","nightmar","the","edit","be","bad","the","music","be","annoi","the","effect","be","laughabl","almost","everyth","be","bad","about","thi","fortun","the","film","can","have","a","sens","of","humor","at","on","point","a","welldress","girl","in","the","movi","crow","sai","to","the","owner","of","the","hous","thei","be","film","at","do","not","worri","we","will","treat","your","hous","a","if","it","be","our","own","to","which","he","respond","that","doe","not","mean","anyth","to","me","you","look","like","you","live","in","a","dump","ha","and","molli","ridicul","onelin","be","enough","to","not","regret","rent","thi","on","you","get","ani","diet","coke","in","here","a","she","ride","in","the","film","professor","car","and","doe","anyon","know","where","i","can","bui","ani","tofu","the","thing","she","mutter","on","the","set","and","where","the","hell","be","my","agent","oh","wait","that","what","i","be","think","for","her"],"filtered":["student","filmmak","enlist","bgrade","actress","delect","divaish","molli","ringwald","complet","horror","film","mother","dreadfulli","dull","kyli","minogu","try","make","year","ago","curiou","plot","choic","sai","littl","ani","aussi","horror","fan","know","genr","sadli","lack","woman","director","film","curs","becaus","molli","kill","psycho","murder","origin","set","back","becaus","ne","exposur","unfortun","curs","still","peopl","start","dye","set","cut","aussi","attempt","modern","slasher","unfortun","doe","bring","anyth","new","excit","tabl","fact","rip","half","craven","filmographi","lot","filmworld","namedrop","la","scream","except","aussi","namedroppingjan","campionse","thi","funni","lot","thi","real","thi","movi","la","new","nightmar","edit","bad","music","annoi","effect","laughabl","almost","everyth","bad","thi","fortun","film","sens","humor","point","welldress","girl","movi","crow","sai","owner","hous","thei","film","worri","treat","hous","respond","doe","mean","anyth","look","like","live","dump","ha","molli","ridicul","onelin","enough","regret","rent","thi","get","ani","diet","coke","ride","film","professor","car","doe","anyon","know","bui","ani","tofu","thing","mutter","set","hell","agent","oh","wait","think"],"filtered2":["student","filmmak","enlist","bgrade","actress","delect","divaish","molli","ringwald","complet","horror","mother","dreadfulli","dull","kyli","minogu","try","make","year","ago","curiou","plot","choic","littl","ani","aussi","horror","fan","know","genr","sadli","lack","woman","director","curs","becaus","molli","kill","psycho","murder","origin","set","back","becaus","ne","exposur","unfortun","curs","still","peopl","start","dye","set","cut","aussi","attempt","modern","slasher","unfortun","doe","bring","anyth","new","excit","tabl","fact","rip","half","craven","filmographi","lot","filmworld","namedrop","la","scream","except","aussi","namedroppingjan","campionse","funni","lot","real","la","new","nightmar","edit","bad","music","annoi","effect","laughabl","almost","everyth","bad","fortun","sens","humor","point","welldress","girl","crow","owner","hous","worri","treat","hous","respond","doe","mean","anyth","look","like","live","dump","ha","molli","ridicul","onelin","enough","regret","rent","get","ani","diet","coke","ride","professor","car","doe","anyon","know","bui","ani","tofu","thing","mutter","set","hell","agent","oh","wait","think"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,9,12,14,16,18,22,23,26,27,29,32,36,57,58,62,63,64,66,69,70,71,72,76,80,83,84,87,88,93,97,103,104,106,109,110,116,118,131,140,158,173,177,183,193,206,213,227,232,234,250,271,273,274,284,303,323,331,347,348,355,367,369,394,397,467,524,526,552,610,626,661,706,729,731,766,768,809,825,849,1002,1054,1069,1230,1404,1465,1566,1596,1678,1725,1751,1774,1903,2005,2142,2165,2984,3093,3816,3997,4640,4657,5031,5528,5772,6179,6597,7710,8265],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,

{"value":"Funny how many of the people who say this is far superior to Romero's version tend to be very young (judging by their other posts). What we have here is a slick, action packed, gory and \"Whoopee\" filled 2 hour MTV video. Frantic editing, pop-video camera work, \"cool\" music blah blah blah<br /><br />Actually it ain't bad compared to other recent remakes (Chainsaw Massacre was a total disaster)... pretty good acting all round, totally predictable in the \"who will die next\" stakes and a total cash in on the Dawn Of The Dead name that will generate plenty of revenue alone by fans of the original who will go and see it out of curiosity...<br /><br />Don't remakes of classics get on your nerves? Can they REALLY not come up with something original? Why remake Dawn Of The Dead? The things that made the original special (the middle segment kids think is so boring is supposed to be slow to show how when you get everything you ever wanted you still ain't happy) are totally missing. This is an action flick, plain and simple. The faster the better. If you are into action flicks (and as this, the 2004 version is well done) fair enough, but for anyone who likes a little substance to their films... get ready to sigh (again)...<br /><br />Watch the cinemas over the next few years as we get The Godfather series remade by whoever the most fashionable Pop director is at the moment, and Star Wars remade, with all the kids saying how the new version is miles better cos the old version is slow and boring and holds a camera shot for more than 5 seconds...<br /><br />Not bad, but in 10 years they will still be discussing the Romero version, not this

{"value":"First of all: I love good Splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art, but this zero-budget-flick is none of it! The picture-quality is so damned low, the soundtrack the most annoying one I ever (!!!!)heard, and as for the FX... well the super-low quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie (what this junk here isn't). No concept, a wafer-thin storyline, primitive acting and rare dialog - I think I counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie, each one repeated about 20 times... same for a lot of film-sequences (may be an indication for which kind of audience this crap was made!!!) The story seems to be that a young boy had to watch his father rape and kill his mother, got psychological damaged and as an adult goes touring, performing a show of self-mutilation. So far, so good... But for these pseudo-art-idiot-directors, this plot is just a line to put cheap produced shock scenes in a row which neither have a message nor make any sense (freshly taken-out bowels are thrown on a naked, bound woman in an earth-hole... why?? and why is that the only time you see both woman and thrower in the whole bloody \"movie\")??? Disturbing? Yes!! Sick? Yes!! Necessary? No! Artistically? NO!!!!! Everyone mistaking this cheap gore-show for art should as soon as possible visit his psychiatrist or should watch Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\" to see how a similar topic can be worked out in an artful way...

{"value":"I was excited to discover this late sixties comedy staring some of my favorite people - Maggie Smith, a very young Bob Newhart and, of course, Peter Ustinov. My disappointment was thus compounded to discover the film doesn't work as either a comedy or a perfect heist film. Ustinov plays a small time crook just out of prison who sets his sites on a large American corporation based in London. Bluffing his way past dimwitted CEO Karl Malden and tech geek Newhart, Ustinov passes himself off as a computer expert and immediately plans the 'perfect heist' part of the film. To do this he needs to get passed a tamper proof security system that guards the corporation mainframe. And here is problem one. His perfect plan only works because everyone else in the film is remarkably trusting and stupid. His lame excuses are taken at face value and this must be the only computer center anywhere not to bother with video cameras. The second problem is the heist (fraud really) happens within the first 30 minutes of the film robbing the rest of the picture of much in way of dramatic tension. Maggie Smith is sadly miscast as Ustinov's ditsy next door neighbor/secretary who just can't keep a job. I love Maggie Smith but she just seems too together here, too composed, the part called for more of a wacky, physical comedian. Furthermore, Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry together, maybe it's the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, as devoid of actual romance as it is, still comes off a little creepy. Ustinov co-wrote the script, and it was thought well of at the time, but I found it unfunny, meandering and a sad waste of a great

{"value":"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare, the sixth installment of the Nightmare on Elm Street series and once again another bad sequel. I think this is tied up with the last sequel of the Dream Child. I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street series box DVD set for my birthday, so I got to see all the sequels. May I say that I'm just getting more and more disappointed though with these sequels, at least the past two, it just seems like Freddy lost his edge. It's almost like the writers were trying to give Freddy a soul and they're just destroying it instead of reinventing the story. This was a sequel that wasn't needed, sorry to Robert Englund, but this was very much below what Freddy Krueger represents.<br /><br />Freddy is back, but he's got something we don't know about, a daughter. Maggie, she's not aware that he is her father, but soon she finds out what his dark secrets are and he wants her help. She has to do her best to resist his powers, but it's hard with all the good memories she has of her loving father. Ironic, isn't it? But Freddy isn't giving up without manipulating her into his ways.<br /><br />Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare is also presented in 3-D, radical, huh? Note the sarcasm. This is one of the worst sequels, it's tied up with the fifth sequel of the Nightmare on Elm Street series, I'd rather watch the second Nightmare on Elm Street to be honest. This just had bad acting, stupid editing, and just over all a bad idea for a story.

{"value":"I'm actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this anti-Christian pseudo-documentary got. Now, I respect the guy's opinion and faith, I myself am not, at this state, believer of the taught Christian doctrine. However, anti-Christian propaganda is somewhat of a different issue.<br /><br />This film has valid points, but they are very few and represented in a very biased context. I'm not recommending against seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not. And this is actually more of a chance than the one the director gives to Christian teachings. Rather than an inquiring approach on the subject, it looks like a personal vendetta on the Christian school that affected his childhood. It also misrepresents the Christians most of the times as either incredibly naive or fundamentalists, no moderation in between.<br /><br />The director uses movie scenes from Passion of Christ without permission, sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents almost solely anti-Christian historians and writers. I actually found the headmaster to be the most down-to-earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified. I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.<br /><br />With this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity.

{"value":"This movie seems to start in the middle, introduces peripheral players as if they were significant and presents main characters without any substance and paper-thin and/or impenetrable back-stories. Almost nobody has a credible or discernible motivation for their actions in this film. The plot rambles and ultimately goes nowhere, the dialogue is clunky and trite and the director has little concept of how to get the best from his actors. It almost feels like there's a first half of this movie but it never got made.<br /><br />We're told that a mysterious pyramid has appeared over New York City and that Central Park has inexplicably become an arctic wasteland. Yet none of this seems to have caused much of a stir amongst the general population and is only of minimal concern to the government.<br /><br />We're presented with the \"evil corporation\" in Eugenics but that's really just a convenient conceit to populate the universe with a couple power-tripping minions. The whole \"Eugenics-is-bad\" double-entendre is heavy-handed and never really pans out here. We're supposed to care about the central characters but we never learn enough about them to know why. So much about this world is underdeveloped or completely undeveloped that it comes off as a 1-hour, 40-minute fatalistic rationalization for rape.<br /><br />On the \"ground-breaking\" digitally animated world created here, all I can say is that at about the same time as this film was made several other directors did the same thing with more seamless and believable results.<br /><br />After

{"value":"Bonfires of the Vanities is a film drenched in flop sweat. I can recall no film that has tried so hard to be so unrelentingly outrageous, provocative and important, yet failed so consistently across the board. It is like a stand up comic who's not getting laughs, but can't leave the stage. The harder the film tries, the louder each attempt at a laugh results in a resounding thud. The desperation the film displays is so glaring it almost rouses pity for all those involved.<br /><br />The film achieves laugh-out-loud status only twice. Once is in the sight of Geraldo Rivera playing an obnoxious, arrogant and amoral TV tabloid journalist -- which is funny only because he apparently doesn't realize he is playing himself. The other scene that deserves to be laughed at is the film's final \"big moment,\" wherein the judge played by Morgan Freeman delivers the sanctimonious lecture about what morality is (\"it's what your mama taught ya!\"). The pomposity of the moment is insulting to the point of being absurd. <br /><br />Yet, one must admit it is a noble effort. It does have a good, if poorly cast, band of actors, who try to make characters out of cardboard thin caricatures. The film looks professionally made and the little cinematic flourishes that director Brian DePalma just loves are apparent, if not particularly effective. But the film, which apparently wishes to be a commentary on modern morals and ethics, never arises above the level of cartoon. Satire requires style. Farce requires energy. Even sitcom requires timing. But the best Bonfires can muster is desperation. In the end, you don't want to laugh, you just want to turn
