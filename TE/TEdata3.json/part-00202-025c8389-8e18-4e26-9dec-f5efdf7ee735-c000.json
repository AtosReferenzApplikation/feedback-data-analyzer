{"value":"A cowboy sympathetic to the plight of a nearby Indian tribe is wrongly accused in the rape and murder of the chief's daughter, leading to much hate and violence.<br /><br />This crackpot nudie feature is fun to look at, though thoroughly impossible to defend on any artistic level. The terrible costumes and the fact that all the Indians are obviously white, makes this look more like a live action cartoon than the serious production that it's press materials pretends it to be.<br /><br />In short, the plentiful nudity (the real reason for watching this) is good. Everything else is not. There's definitely better examples of both genres.<br /><br />More interesting is that The Ramrodder was filmed at the infamous Spahn Movie Ranch and features not one, but two members of the Manson family, Catherine Share and Bobby Beausoleil, who was probably already in the can for murder at the time this hit the soda-stained screens of the Pussycat Theater!","finished_norm":["a","cowboi","sympathet","to","the","plight","of","a","nearbi","indian","tribe","be","wrongli","accus","in","the","rape","and","murder","of","the","chief","daughter","lead","to","much","hate","and","violencebr","br","thi","crackpot","nudi","featur","be","fun","to","look","at","though","thoroughli","imposs","to","defend","on","ani","artist","level","the","terribl","costum","and","the","fact","that","all","the","indian","be","obvious","white","make","thi","look","much","like","a","live","action","cartoon","than","the","seriou","product","that","it","press","materi","pretend","it","to","bebr","br","in","short","the","plenti","nuditi","the","real","reason","for","watch","thi","be","good","everyth","els","be","not","there","definit","well","exampl","of","both","genresbr","br","much","interest","be","that","the","ramrodd","be","film","at","the","infam","spahn","movi","ranch","and","featur","not","on","but","two","member","of","the","manson","famili","catherin","share","and","bobbi","beausoleil","who","be","probabl","alreadi","in","the","can","for","murder","at","the","time","thi","hit","the","sodastain","screen","of","the","pussycat","theater"],"filtered":["cowboi","sympathet","plight","nearbi","indian","tribe","wrongli","accus","rape","murder","chief","daughter","lead","much","hate","violencebr","br","thi","crackpot","nudi","featur","fun","look","though","thoroughli","imposs","defend","ani","artist","level","terribl","costum","fact","indian","obvious","white","make","thi","look","much","like","live","action","cartoon","seriou","product","press","materi","pretend","bebr","br","short","plenti","nuditi","real","reason","watch","thi","good","everyth","els","definit","well","exampl","genresbr","br","much","interest","ramrodd","film","infam","spahn","movi","ranch","featur","two","member","manson","famili","catherin","share","bobbi","beausoleil","probabl","alreadi","murder","time","thi","hit","sodastain","screen","pussycat","theater"],"filtered2":["cowboi","sympathet","plight","nearbi","indian","tribe","wrongli","accus","rape","murder","chief","daughter","lead","hate","violencebr","crackpot","nudi","featur","fun","look","though","thoroughli","imposs","defend","ani","artist","level","terribl","costum","fact","indian","obvious","white","make","look","like","live","action","cartoon","seriou","product","press","materi","pretend","bebr","short","plenti","nuditi","real","reason","watch","good","everyth","els","definit","well","exampl","genresbr","interest","ramrodd","infam","spahn","ranch","featur","two","member","manson","famili","catherin","share","bobbi","beausoleil","probabl","alreadi","murder","time","hit","sodastain","screen","pussycat","theater"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,7,8,16,20,27,47,60,80,86,95,97,116,129,148,157,166,182,190,192,193,196,259,272,273,305,307,330,339,341,359,388,392,424,426,445,493,537,612,618,653,724,746,776,888,901,1025,1124,1371,1590,1964,2054,2092,2160,2278,2406,2484,2551,2770,3028,3071,3430,4652,6080,6586,7073,8531],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,7,8,16,20,27,47,60,80,86,95,97,116,129,148,157,166,182,190,192,193,196,259,272,273,305,307,330,339,341,359,388,392,424,426,445,493,537,612,618,653,724,746,776,888,901,1025,1124,1371,1590,1964,2054,2092,2160,2278,2406,2484,2551,2770,3028,3071,3430,4652,6080,6586,7073,8531],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.393227744058217,1.165345040023057,1.3002700588679295,1.7064694353107215,1.838176641236591,1.9951803900462557,2.031112399272319,2.0323326556775485,2.0545557924622586,2.2466628996789315,2.4106958340079214,2.3018654096236517,2.3360150694757706,2.4423870329693536,2.7365296724240786,2.558331832813986,2.5318267134339894,2.517840471459249,2.478925055209576,2.7464553122240485,2.8028805344481915,5.934838391705887,5.7225627547931115,2.8767855639325206,2.9292757465539174,3.003844442051426,2.933776879434709,3.2189558216683714,3.0914425013694116,3.0670934723591254,3.212973749990824,3.3909310864081816,3.241201430615691,3.342254038012865,3.424750734647968,3.5929222627171646,3.5642670069567886,3.9911462095687695,3.7987743169213135,4.00861390260916,3.770603439954617,3.9323057095458362,3.8962296530720266,8.872703292652895,4.181290492043933,4.436351646326448,4.573751515728891,4.900964426937307,5.02684467282631,5.129498826886393,5.014723312293965,5.02684467282631,5.3064295350454715,5.3064295350454715,5.185068678041204,5.626901430320244,5.408212229355414,5.604922523601468,5.604922523601468,6.032366538428407,6.543192162194399,6.600350576034347,6.725513718988353,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6606027355064852E-4,1.65

{"value":"Slashers.....well if you like horrors its definitely one to see, otherwise don't even bother.It is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget, For instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere, and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow, trust me you wont need to look for them.Also try to ignore the cheesy actors, if thats what you call them!!The basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever live's at the end gets rich. Now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days,For example when i watched it i thought to my self i would'nt mind having a go at this game! especially for $12.000.000. so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind.","finished_norm":["slasherswel","if","you","like","horror","it","definit","on","to","see","otherwis","do","not","even","botherit","be","complet","obviou","that","thi","film","have","a","extrem","low","budget","for","instanc","it","look","a","if","the","entir","film","have","be","shoot","in","a","warehous","somewher","and","on","numer","occas","you","will","see","the","mike","boom","shadow","and","the","camera","man","shadow","trust","me","you","wont","ne","to","look","for","themalso","try","to","ignor","the","cheesi","actor","if","that","what","you","call","themth","basic","outlin","be","a","few","peopl","decid","to","go","on","a","game","show","where","thei","have","to","surviv","a","night","in","a","big","maze","due","to","their","be","killer","on","the","loos","and","whoever","live","at","the","end","get","rich","now","there","be","someth","about","thi","film","that","keep","you","watch","and","rare","do","you","find","that","with","a","cheap","budget","horror","thi","daysfor","exampl","when","i","watch","it","i","think","to","my","self","i","would","not","mind","have","a","go","at","thi","game","especi","for","so","anywai","i","would","recommend","you","watch","it","and","make","up","your","own","mind"],"filtered":["slasherswel","like","horror","definit","see","otherwis","even","botherit","complet","obviou","thi","film","extrem","low","budget","instanc","look","entir","film","shoot","warehous","somewher","numer","occas","see","mike","boom","shadow","camera","man","shadow","trust","wont","ne","look","themalso","try","ignor","cheesi","actor","call","themth","basic","outlin","peopl","decid","go","game","show","thei","surviv","night","big","maze","due","killer","loos","whoever","live","end","get","rich","someth","thi","film","keep","watch","rare","find","cheap","budget","horror","thi","daysfor","exampl","watch","think","self","mind","go","thi","game","especi","anywai","recommend","watch","make","mind"],"filtered2":["slasherswel","like","horror","definit","see","otherwis","even","botherit","complet","obviou","extrem","low","budget","instanc","look","entir","shoot","warehous","somewher","numer","occas","see","mike","boom","shadow","camera","man","shadow","trust","wont","ne","look","themalso","try","ignor","cheesi","actor","call","themth","basic","outlin","peopl","decid","go","game","show","surviv","night","big","maze","due","killer","loos","whoever","live","end","get","rich","someth","keep","watch","rare","find","cheap","budget","horror","daysfor","exampl","watch","think","self","mind","go","game","especi","anywai","recommend","watch","make","mind"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,7,12,16,23,24,28,36,38,41,45,53,82,83,103,110,116,117,134,142,198,210,217,231,238,249,252,256,267,286,298,307,329,351,374,383,386,392,543,568,627,762,804,886,937,940,1013,1108,1216,1290,1327,1593,1609,1768,2418,2635,3129,3647,4093,5381],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,7,12,16,23,24,28,36,38,41,45,53,82,83,103,110,116,117,134,142,198,210,217,231,238,249,252,256,267,286,298,307,329,351,374,383,386,392,543,568,627,762,804,886,937,940,1013,1108,1216,1290,1327,1593,1609,1768,2418,2635,3129,3647,4093,5381],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,2.8828493162168796,1.066728610262888,2.393227744058217,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,1.8162961064622165,1.7003182735607676,2.020196584395323,4.584637595480144,2.098582041218749,2.1290479736304078,2.2466628996789315,2.2797301185117202,2.2443961816702407,2.2844323215331563,2.5439726117360975,2.687151791517189,2.6113665294700725,2.7049353070058615,5.194609285626992,2.6754694156628323,3.0433232530252132,5.497904384845272,2.7085302779237206,2.780700890737216,2.7819920465008363,2.8767855639325206,2.951986790814132,3.0135689919434205,6.914426021585259,3.0433232530252132,3.0433232530252132,3.0670934723591254,3.477726550625732,3.4471119148061256,3.477726550625732,3.7465885637507435,3.7740817043309423,3.9782428047328615,4.030886538218284,3.952924996748572,4.039936373738201,4.165705761027235,4.280272325592784,4.3336974922663645,4.613282354485526,4.589376833631972,4.621379564718146,9.597669863721855,5.129498826886393,5.390512652256013,5.482320201509136,5.719991853386255,6.101359409915359,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6168948300964624E-4,1.6154620178448803E-4,1.6158608878962365E-4,1.6155360481710245E-4,1.6156889394949376E-4,1.61545311067467E-4,1.6159555390199298E-4,1.6152127575996212E-4,1.615462359256263E-4,1.6171317645524442E-4,1.6299632344213242E-4,1.6154650275823333E-4,1.616994975050397E-4,1

{"value":"How wonderful. Yet another movie about America by someone who has visited here probably a half dozen times, a day a piece, and believes himself to be an \"expert\" on the country. Sheesh. I should take a trip to Germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about Germany as the \"land of Nazis\" or some such. Wim IL boy, you should get together with Lars von Trier and make the ULTIMATE movie about the Americans. Of course we all know it takes a pretentious left-leaning \"we are the world\" European to make a \"real\" movie about America.<br /><br />Yeah, right. For a continent that started not one but TWO world wars, Europe sure has a lot of opinions about America's wrong \"foreign policy\".<br /><br />P.S. Don't worry, Wim IL boy, there's plenty of UC-Berkeley Americans that'll just love your movie. Of course, these are the same people who thinks George W.

{"value":"How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other better Flemish movie \"Congo Express (1986)\"? There are also some characters in congo Express put together without having really a relation to each other: Jean, (de Congolees), the workman, the two taxi-drivers, the street-singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels wasn't. That should not be a reason to pardon the flaws in the script (if there is a script) of Anyway the wind blows. The joke (the only one!) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is taken from that great Flemish movie \"De Witte (1934)\" where De Witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movie but there comes no explanation after. Tom Barman delivers us here a movie that is more like an experiment to watch at the television than a movie for the theatres.

{"value":"I got the DVD very cheap and I'm a total Drewbie, and thats probably the only constellation where this movie could ever interest anyone.<br /><br />An early Drew movie, she's looking great, and she gets a quite lot of really cute scenes of her, like a shower scene, a sexy dance scene, quite a number of sexy outfits etc. She does never show the friendly charm we know from her more recent movies.<br /><br />The movie itself is pretty average or sub-average, and much more looking like being made for the TV than one for the cinema. There is no real horror or tension built up and the dialogs are often cheesy.<br /><br />The most interesting part is probably the end because I honestly don't understand it. But maybe there is nothing to understand about it anyway. But at least you don't get the end you would be expecting, and it also comes much sooner than one would have expected.<br /><br />Overall I think this movie is exclusively for

{"value":"What a terrible movie. The acting was bad, the pacing was bad, the cinematography was bad, the directing was bad, the \"special\" effects were bad. You expect a certain degree of badness in a slasher, but even the killings were bad.<br /><br />First of all, the past event that set up the motive for the slaughter went on for 15 or 20 minutes. I thought it would never end. They could have removed 80% of it and explained what happened well enough.<br /><br />Then, the victims were invited to the \"reunion\" in an abandoned school which still had all the utilities turned on. One of the victims thought this was a little odd, but they dismissed it and decided to break in anyway.<br /><br />Finally, the killings were so fake as to be virtually unwatchable.<br /><br />There is no reason to watch this movie, unless you want to see some breasts, and not very good breasts at that.

{"value":"Incarcerated train robber near Yuma breaks free his chain-gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). Attempt to bring the western genre up-to-date with 1970s-style violence and brutality isn't even in the same league as some of the new-fangled westerns which came out of the late-'60s. It is impossibly simple and square, with the female characters merely around as punching-bags and possible rape victims. As the former sheriff back in command, Charlton Heston gives one of his laziest, least-inspired performances ever (he has one good moment, attempting to read a letter and fumbling for his glasses). James Coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, is pretty much on auto-pilot as well, but Coburn has a way of turning even the hoariest dialogue and situations into something prickly and unnerving.

{"value":"Rodney Dangerfield isn't the main character of this movie. He's barely in it. Most of the screen time is dominated by unfunny jokes. One running gag is that a character is named Jerk Off. There are also lots of erection jokes, where the punch line is someone has an erection. This movie is as funny as Kirstie Ally's British accent is convincing.<br /><br />This movie started off like a weak action movie: five minutes of back story and then bam! Unfunny jokes. But, aside from the terrible writing, the movie is also poorly directed and the acting is terrible. Also, this movie does the old bad comedy cliché of having lots of well-known B-movie actors. Harland Williams, Gilbert Godfried, Randy Quaid, and Phil La Mar. These are just some of the people that spend more time on the screen than Rodney, even though he's billed as the main character. Don't be surprised to find this movie at a drug store selling for five bucks.

{"value":"Horrible film. About an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl. Boring. Tatum O Neil goes through the motions in her part, and has some of the corniest lines in film history. Richard Burton looks close to death in this film, and we're supposed to believe he looks \"Good for sixty\". The acting is bad, as is the plot. The characters are awful, as is the story. It's really hard to feel for anyone in this film, except Larry Ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on Tatum, he's kind of funny. This movie is really a waste of time. If you are a Tatum fan, like me - which is why I rented it in the first place - please don't see this movie. She is really bad in it, and you'll wonder if maybe PAPER MOON was a fluke. It wasn't, because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS it's known she can act well, but still, don't rent this movie.

{"value":"This movie is incomprehendably bad. It begins with several random explosions and then cuts to a sock puppet of a T-Rex that talks (!) to the audience. It goes back and forth between sock puppetry and animation throughout, probably because the film makers couldn't afford live actors. I'll spare you the long, tiresome, relentless plot that drags this pitiful film on for a brutal 85 minutes.<br /><br />One of my friends found this very rare video at a hobby shop somewhere that sells out of print b-movies, and he bought it for the sole purpose of making fun of it, but, as it turns out, our intervention was not neecessary. This film makes fun of itself better than we could.<br /><br />I thought that Ed Wood's \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" was the cheesiest movie in existence, but leave it to Japanamation/Lego cars/Sock puppets to outdo him. If you see this movie anywhere, buy it without hesitation.

{"value":"Well, what was fun... except for the fun part.<br /><br />It's my second least favorite so far, I even thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine'.<br /><br />Let's start with the good. The teaser, it was incredibly well done and also emotional. Being the great animal lover that I am, it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode.<br /><br />But then there's all the bad, and believe me there is a lot of it. Little made sense, so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated? whaaa??? the dialog was also pretty awful. There were about one or two quotable lines. <br /><br />and worst of all, having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me. In the end... what's the point? they all pretty much died.

{"value":"This film is terrible. Every line is stolen from 8MM (the Italian dubbed version, at least). If you like trash... real trash, give it a try; but beware: this ain't the \"so bad it's good\" kind of flick. In its cheapness, it may really look like a porno but, believe me, if you're looking for \"snuff\", s & m, hardcore, softcore... or even an ordinary erotic thriller, go find something else in store! I'm telling you this, 'cause the absolutely uninspired and unconvincing shooting, acting, plot, dialogues (the only good lines, as I said before, are the ones they stolen from Joel Schumacher's 8MM!) will bore you to tears in a few minutes and the \"happy ending\" is absolutely revolting! I'll give it one star: a half for the sudden shot in the back scene, after \"the eyes of the victim\" monologue (stolen from 8MM as well) and a half for mom & daughter's sexy bodies (that didn't

{"value":"An absolute steaming pile of cow dung. It's mind-blowing to me that this film was even made. Hip-Hop and old westerns just don't seem to mix. What target audience were these people thinking of when planning this trainwreck.<br /><br />Not only is the concept and plot a joke, but the acting is atrocious and the fact that some decent actors were even in this nightmare of a film makes their entire careers a laughing stock. The chick from clueless should never be forgiven and she is stripped of any remaining dignity she had. After reading the first ten pages of dialogue she should have been asking which one of her friends was playing this sick joke. After some research, I actually found a list of some other actors who passed on this film: Jada Pinkett-Smith, Denzel Washington, Brandy, Monique, Kim Kardasian, Jenna Jameson, Oprah, and finally

{"value":"A truly dreadful film. I did not know initially that this was a Kiwi effort - but very soon I started to realize that all the characters were speaking with hardly disguised kiwi accents under the fake American ones. Why did it need to be set n America anyway? - it could have been set in NZ and then the actors could have used their normal voices. Surely someone in the production team could hear the dreadful attempts at speaking with American accents? A bad bad film. I am surprised it has lasted this long - how did it make it out of the can? It just seemed like a very poor attempt at a Segal/Willis type action man flick.A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! If there was any TAXPAYER money in this piece of trash, I would be leading a revolution to have all the money put back into the Treasury. I am still reeling (get it? pun, reeling!) at the absolute garbage I have just seen. Why did I continue to watch?

{"value":"\"Dracula II:Ascension\" is the story of a group of medical students who come across the body of Dracula.When a mysterious stranger appears and offers the students $30 million to harvest the body and steal its blood for auction,it's an offer they can hardly refuse.Soon the students also find themselves relentlessly pursued by a vampire killer from the Vatican!\"Dracula II:Ascension\" is a slightly entertaining horror film that has many flaws.The characters are one-dimensional and the acting is pretty average.There are some good gore effects like really cool double decapitation scene,but there is not enough violence for my liking.The film becomes quickly boring and forgettable and there is absolutely no suspense.So if you like modern vampire flicks give it a look.I prefer

{"value":"In my knowledge, Largo winch was a famous Belgium comics (never read) telling the adventures of a playboy, a sort of James Bond without the spy life! So, when I had to choose a movie for a 5 years-old kid, I picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of James Bond!<br /><br />But, just after the opening credits, I got heavy doubts: when American movies offer amazing start, here, no action and a torrid sex scene  Then, the story get very complicated with financial moves I thought I lost the kid.<br /><br />But, strangely, he had been caught by Largo, and more than James Bond! <br /><br />Was it the excellent interpretation of Tomer Sisley? The difficult relationship Largo has with his father? The multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys, the bad guys are the friends?

{"value":"I haven't seen anything this bad since I walked out of the James Bond movie \"Moonraker\" twenty years ago. I managed to sit through the entirety of this one only because of Tilda Swinton, but there was nothing she could do to save this beast.<br /><br />As a cross between \"Pi\", \"Orlando\", and \"Tron\", this movie failed miserably in every aspect of moviemaking. The characters were cardboard and unable to evoke any kind of sympathy. The plot was wholly unbelievable. The acting was, with the exception of Swinton, amateur. The computer graphics were worse than in \"Tron.\" Timothy Leary was extremely annoying. I could go on, but what's the point.<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this film is that Tilda Swinton was in it. I have no idea why an actress of her caliber consented to appear in such a dud, but she most likely regrets it now.<br /><br />Don't waste your money or your time on this stinker.

{"value":"Really, truly, abysmally, garishly, awful. But actor Clayton Moore (the movie Lone Ranger) acquits himself competently as an actor. He's the only one.<br /><br />A rare treat, for five minutes, if you want to plumb the depths of grotesquely transparent special effects, southern California as \"the moon\" (again and again and again), and acting so woodenly inept that it may be a spoof . . . except that it's clear that it isn't--no humor here, except unintentionally.<br /><br />The dialogue may be worse than any of these other aspects, and the costumes . . . well, enough said. Plot? What plot? Bad guy (well, head bad guy) and his henchmen, including his earthly agent called Krog (listen carefully or you'll suspect it's a spoof on the name of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc)and his unbelievably

{"value":"This movie has the made for TV stink all over it. Though, it started out with great intentions, featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes. The film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue, and rushed TV sappy melodramatic acting. The characters were so sappy that at times I thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo, and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another. The Germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch. The only thing that the German officers talked about was how wonderful the Americans are. Please take my word for this. I am a huge fan of the war genre, and this movie is crap. Nevertheless, this DVD does have an excellent extra feature, covering letters from the WWI front lines, thus making this rental not a total waste of my

{"value":"This movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years. Not even woody Harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom.<br /><br />The murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not, nothing is of any interest. The cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful , I just sat in utter amazement during this movie, thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining <br /><br />The producers of this movie were very clever. They made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison ,Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie.(boy are they in for a horrible

{"value":"Cuba Gooding Jr. is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the U.S. President, i'll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for, and this film shows us why. He teams up with a persistent news reporter (Angie Harmon) to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the president's death, and so on, blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />Even with a cast of James Woods, Cuba Gooding Jr, Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game' fails to grab your attention, plain and simple; some of the action is good, the acting isn't all bad and the story although clichéd and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie - WELL IT DOESN'T! The writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that, at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the characters.<br /><br />4/10

{"value":"William S. Hart (as Jim Treen), the most eligible bachelor in Canyon City, is finally getting hitched, to pretty blonde waitress Leona Hutton (as Molly Stewart). His fiancée doesn't know it, but Mr. Hart is secretly the western town's \"Most Wanted\" bandit. However, Hart is planning to go straight, due to his marriage plans. Unfortunately, Ms. Hutton discovers Hart's secret stash, whilst cleaning up his untidy cabin; so, she calls off the wedding. Next, Hutton succumbs to the charms of mining swindler Frank Borzage (as W. Sloane Carey).<br /><br />Serviceable entertainment from superstar Hart; he was ranked no less than #1 at the box office, by Quigley Publications, for the years 1915 and 1916 (ahead of Mary Pickford). The principles perform capably. Later on, Frank Borzage was quite a director; and Leona Hutton, a suicide... <br /><br />**** A Knight of the Trails (8/20/15) William S. Hart ~ William S.

{"value":"I saw this movie originally in the theater, when I was 10. Even at that age the 'humor' was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence.<br /><br />In the past, whenever I would see Ed Begley Jr. or jeff Goldblum I would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad. Until I was reminded of the existence of this movie today, I was unsure why I felt that way. Apparently I blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained. Apparently I forgot that I saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen, nay EATEN by the creators of this inhuman work.<br /><br />I haven't been brave enough to try watching it as an adult. I imagine that as part of the healing process that I should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that I can *truly* put it behind me.

{"value":"I read the book a long time back and don't specifically remember the plot but do remember that I enjoyed it. Since I'm home sick on the couch it seemed like a good idea and Hey !! It is a Lifetime movie.<br /><br />The movie is populated with grade B actors and actresses.<br /><br />The female cast is right out of Desperate Housewives. I've never seen the show but there are lots of commercials for the show and I get the gist. Is there nothing original anymore? Sure, but not on Lifetime.<br /><br />The male cast are all fairly effeminate looking and acting but the girls need to have husbands I suppose.<br /><br />In one scene a female is struggling with a male, for her life, and what does she do??? Kicks him in the testicles. What else? Women love that but let me tell you girls something... It's not as easy as it's always made to look.<br /><br />It wasn't all bad.

{"value":"Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. What else can I say. Kate Jackson must have been desperate to direct. May be she should go back to acting...on second thought she was a bad actress to. Who would put money in to producing something this bad. I like anti-Christ movies and usually have a good laugh and the odd scare but this one is just Bad Bad Bad. The acting by the stars was worse than what you find on a soap opera. The special effects, if you can call them that, where laughable. I would not be surprised if you played the scenes in slow motion you would see the tubes the blood shoots out of. We had to turn the disc off after only 30 minutes. This so called movies original prints should be destroyed, all disc' and tapes destroyed and all the people associated with the making of the movie have to pay back money to the people that rented the movie.

{"value":"This really doesn't match up to Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin isn't as funny or wacky or as hyperactive. The scenery and music are uninspired and plot just isn't interesting. <br /><br />The only good thing about this 'un is the nudity (only in the uncut version) provided by Fujiko. It helped spice up some of the tedious scenes. CoC had a formidable villain and set up the movie for some imaginative set-pieces. The locations in TSoTG are not very vivid or engaging. <br /><br />Zenigata, Goemon and Jigen don't even provide decent sideshow entertainment this time. It's like they were just filling a contractual obligation by appearing. <br /><br />The DVD is in full-frame with Dolby Stereo sound. It has a decent amount of extras, including quite a few trailers. But one curious thing. There is no chapter selection on the disc or timecode displayed on the player once inserted.

{"value":"The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this utterly horrific film.<br /><br />I have no words, no idea where to start to describe the truly awful film I sat through last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but like other posters I felt uncomfortable and embarrassed for the cast.<br /><br />The dialog was so contrived, the family was this cookie cutter Walton's family and the film has been so many times before that I am shocked someone thought it was an original idea.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and take a pass on this terrifyingly bad movie and don't believe everything you read on the IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different

{"value":"with a title like this, you know not to expect a great horror movie. But this was really bad, even with low expectations. The plot is really insulting and stupid: an escaped criminal wears a Halloween mask, so everyone around him thinks he's someone else. this joke might actually work for 5 or 10 minutes, but not during the entire movie ! the actors are not that bad, but their characters are rather dumb and the story is boring and downright stupid. No suspense, no excitement and little gore (very cheap). Satan's Little Helper tries to combine horror (...) with comedy and fails dramatically at that. It became so boring towards the end, that I actually stopped watching 10 minutes before the end. I couldn't care whatever happened. Amanda Plummer was great in Pulp Fiction, but come on.. that was 13 years ago, and she hasn't done anything decent after that. So no wonder that she had to sink as low as this piece of crap..

{"value":"Uh oh! Another gay film. This time it's showing the black side. Bet your last dollar it's gonna have an unhappy ending! But WHY? With only less than a half dozen exceptions, ALL gay films have to end in death or an \"addio\" finale. It's like all the European Film Noir releases in the 40's, 50's, 60's, and 70's. The lead...male or female must die or ride off alone into oblivion. Why in God's name must writers, directors, and producers have the audience leave the theatre feeling depressed? After all, it's supposed to be gay...not glum. Maybe the category should be changed to a 'glum' film. A large percentage of gay relationships DO last and the couples DO ride off together into the sunset! No matter who writes or produces, he only shows the down side of gay life and gives the incorrect impression of gay lifestyle. This movie just proves my point. If you rent the DVD, take an antidepressant, for here comes another 'gay' film!

{"value":"I'm one of the millions of Columbo addicts all over the world and just watched this,the episode that started it all, on British Channel 5. It IS fascinating to think what sprung from this so-so movie and I can only marvel at whoever spotted the massive potential of \"Columbo\" and added all the little touches that make it such a marvellous & classic series. That said, this particular movie is not as good as the rest (except for the embarrassing final episode & the patronising British episode). If Columbo had been made as per the original 'pilot' it certainly would NOT have gone on for very long, or be watched and loved world-wide. In this film Lt Columbo is smartly dressed, drives a normal car, has a partner, doesn't talk about his alleged relatives and comes across as quite aggressive. There's also none of the cat-and-mouse chemistry between Columbo and \"the villain\".

{"value":"It's hard to know what was going through Per Kristensen and Morten Lindberg's heads when they wrote \"Gayniggers from Outer Space\" - the movie is billed as a comedy, yet there are no real jokes beside the crude character names (Capt. B. Dick, Sgt. Shaved Balls). The rest of the movie is a (presumably) unintentionally funny affair with ridiculously unsynchronised voice-overs (with the 'actors' basically reading their lines with no hint of feeling), 'futuristic' computer displays filled with spelling mistakes, and a plot that makes almost no sense.<br /><br />Even though 65% of viewers have given this movie a perfect 10 out of 10, this is the complete opposite of what a good film is. It may be ENTERTAINING to watch with some friends, but this film only deserves about a '2' out of ten...slightly higher than the lower possible rating only because of the sheer fact that the writers
