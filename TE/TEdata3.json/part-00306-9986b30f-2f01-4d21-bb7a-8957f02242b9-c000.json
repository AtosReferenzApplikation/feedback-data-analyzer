{"value":"I could never stand watching Happy Days after Chachi joined the cast, so I knew I was in trouble when the best scene in this movie featured Scott Baio (a skateboard chase scene!). Jodie Foster in her first \"grown-up\" role turns in her usual professional performance but that is no excuse for this boring mess. Two hours out of my life that I'll never get back! No noteworthy characters, unbelievable storyline, questionable editing and horrendous cinematography but worst of all, I couldn't have cared less. The story of California teens in the 1970's, where the kids live miserable lives and all their parents are idiots. Don't waste your time watching this ugly excuse for a movie.","finished_norm":["i","can","never","stand","watch","happi","dai","after","chachi","join","the","cast","so","i","know","i","be","in","troubl","when","the","well","scene","in","thi","movi","featur","scott","baio","a","skateboard","chase","scene","jodi","foster","in","her","grownup","role","turn","in","her","usual","profession","perform","but","that","be","no","excus","for","thi","bore","mess","two","hour","out","of","my","life","that","i","will","never","get","back","no","noteworthi","charact","unbeliev","storylin","question","edit","and","horrend","cinematographi","but","wrong","of","all","i","can","not","have","care","littl","the","stori","of","california","teen","in","the","where","the","kid","live","miser","live","and","all","their","parent","be","idiot","do","not","wast","your","time","watch","thi","ugli","excus","for","a","movi"],"filtered":["never","stand","watch","happi","dai","chachi","join","cast","know","troubl","well","scene","thi","movi","featur","scott","baio","skateboard","chase","scene","jodi","foster","grownup","role","turn","usual","profession","perform","excus","thi","bore","mess","two","hour","life","never","get","back","noteworthi","charact","unbeliev","storylin","question","edit","horrend","cinematographi","wrong","care","littl","stori","california","teen","kid","live","miser","live","parent","idiot","wast","time","watch","thi","ugli","excus","movi"],"filtered2":["never","stand","watch","happi","dai","chachi","join","cast","know","troubl","well","scene","featur","scott","baio","skateboard","chase","scene","jodi","foster","grownup","role","turn","usual","profession","perform","excus","bore","mess","two","hour","life","never","get","back","noteworthi","charact","unbeliev","storylin","question","edit","horrend","cinematographi","wrong","care","littl","stori","california","teen","kid","live","miser","live","parent","idiot","wast","time","watch","ugli","excus"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,8,10,14,17,19,20,25,26,42,47,63,75,89,92,96,105,108,114,116,128,132,174,205,265,305,348,377,378,407,515,530,571,605,617,629,670,706,752,881,895,930,1160,1319,1330,1686,2201,2545,4621,4869,7155],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,8,10,14,17,19,20,25,26,42,47,63,75,89,92,96,105,108,114,116,128,132,174,205,265,305,348,377,378,407,515,530,571,605,617,629,670,706,752,881,895,930,1160,1319,1330,1686,2201,2545,4621,4869,7155],"values":[0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,3.2439908614907673,1.7064694353107215,1.8729627573220065,1.9742250248702675,1.9940046109572438,2.0489535369135887,2.0390708128715254,2.1765612129984904,2.138507503627933,2.4433074195966826,4.493325799357863,2.3409902041158843,2.253494045787767,2.456282578459816,2.571852579609833,2.73529586597515,2.8612813773965557,3.0103169565570433,3.0602441305135506,3.130944944345658,3.120015873813468,3.3956930001684253,3.5784919978881358,3.467417180966871,3.5474598886404074,7.0239710008934955,3.488143311483988,3.7264536553416874,3.6590123745461547,3.719831114581194,4.086456389373095,3.9954846111673676,4.3095999406873045,4.2574141875167335,4.403125998698128,4.370968887063596,4.662879295624898,5.482320201509136,5.214056214914456,6.489124940924123,6.101359409915359,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.541589231421368E-5,7.490734532154258E-5,7.548967850358247E-5,7.50534983369703E-5,7.505472800403973E-5,7.494981649309059E-5,7.517272774878217E-5,7.491813148980963E-5,7.508657476029688E-5,8.330445588193448E-5,0.7231595194369955,7.47971971079616E-5,7.61932497002705E-5,7.728016314964696E-5,7.485173844381585E-5,7.464488053424137E-5,7.650680370608382E-5,7.517977086594468E-5,7.49465259197E-5,7.500864326442202E-5,7.57343958814591E-5,7.525425499481863E-5,7.533994338068445E-5,7.542111371961587E-5,7.599993202005089E-5,7.560247377120431E-5,7.878065814495547E-5,7.4819433628849E-5,7.482143522391652E-5,7.501099490693992E-5,7.660533604342296E-5,7.517541484020284E-5,8.069443959218752E-5,7.538687218876864E-5,7.490087121763572E-5,7.524658811346776E-5,7.482581867291656E-5,7.487003522646604E-5,7.464450551232628E-5,7.466387174084024E-5,7.483193104200436E-5,7.562124935021479E-5,7.523698600382523E-5,7.493951999284E-5,7.585011373963853E-5,7.496828219011836E-5,7.745910592932962E-5,0.09810376341261531,7.468242979468827E-5,7.484748253167855E-5,7.482152260484489E-5,7.69272815082061E-5,7.484859611952825E-5,7.465724329518103E-5,7.547671338309212E-5,7.486787513092479E-5,8.05121715110035E-5,7.48061742736749E-5,7.468156613523164E-5,7.503814869448813E-5,7.57824640645051E-5,7.503318449412793E-5,7.46677498785367E-5,7.484160229821733E-5,7.464540835083374E-5,7.63725483831815

{"value":"There are laughs in this film, that is for sure. Michael Keaton is a talent and he used to be funny (before he decided he was a serious actor). However, what bothers me so much about this film, is how unlikable practically all of the characters are. Other than the main two leads, everybody is a jerk. I mean, these small town losers are about as uncouth as you can get. You just watch and think, man, these losers should be unemployed. Moreover, the American factory worker is portrayed as a lazy and ungrateful slob. It made me wonder if this film was made by Japanese nationalists. Oh sure, in the end they all come together as one, but I just did not enjoy the trip to get there.","finished_norm":["there","be","laugh","in","thi","film","that","be","for","sure","michael","keaton","be","a","talent","and","he","us","to","be","funni","befor","he","decid","he","be","a","seriou","actor","howev","what","bother","me","so","much","about","thi","film","be","how","unlik","practic","all","of","the","charact","be","other","than","the","main","two","lead","everybodi","be","a","jerk","i","mean","thi","small","town","loser","be","about","a","uncouth","a","you","can","get","you","just","watch","and","think","man","thi","loser","should","be","unemploi","moreov","the","american","factori","worker","be","portrai","a","a","lazi","and","ungrat","slob","it","make","me","wonder","if","thi","film","be","make","by","japanes","nationalist","oh","sure","in","the","end","thei","all","come","togeth","a","on","but","i","just","do","not","enjoi","the","trip","to","get","there"],"filtered":["laugh","thi","film","sure","michael","keaton","talent","us","funni","befor","decid","seriou","actor","howev","bother","much","thi","film","unlik","practic","charact","main","two","lead","everybodi","jerk","mean","thi","small","town","loser","uncouth","get","watch","think","man","thi","loser","unemploi","moreov","american","factori","worker","portrai","lazi","ungrat","slob","make","wonder","thi","film","make","japanes","nationalist","oh","sure","end","thei","come","togeth","enjoi","trip","get"],"filtered2":["laugh","sure","michael","keaton","talent","us","funni","befor","decid","seriou","actor","howev","bother","unlik","practic","charact","main","two","lead","everybodi","jerk","mean","small","town","loser","uncouth","get","watch","think","man","loser","unemploi","moreov","american","factori","worker","portrai","lazi","ungrat","slob","make","wonder","make","japanes","nationalist","oh","sure","end","come","togeth","enjoi","trip","get"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,10,12,24,34,41,45,47,56,62,79,88,113,119,133,157,175,179,200,223,234,249,270,276,363,450,466,469,493,496,615,843,917,1043,1215,1274,1525,1531,1918,2285,2940,5451,6742,6867],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,10,12,24,34,41,45,47,56,62,79,88,113,119,133,157,175,179,200,223,234,249,270,276,363,450,466,469,493,496,615,843,917,1043,1215,1274,1525,1531,1918,2285,2940,5451,6742,6867],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.5932680941439847,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.3210361566119257,1.3982850089458962,1.5687599167621034,1.8162961064622165,1.7064694353107215,1.8610609350701788,2.0226120445069267,1.9469506069506084,2.0317223413467334,2.1521782565202803,4.3306817978619945,2.3212364753796515,2.3360150694757706,2.3791142619576227,2.507968722980095,2.5308211829319704,2.825563294794476,2.673149229007135,2.6754694156628323,2.731603554088023,2.7884729505849193,3.0349689855553557,3.469984576472117,3.4446025032006995,3.328770687675578,3.342254038012865,3.293679367864308,3.5013187326425523,4.339813719283801,3.9363956947973615,4.115443926246347,4.291900363587903,5.243909178064138,9.394730943392135,4.605250182788262,4.848596441419991,5.064116067623542,5.541743621979936,6.255510089742618,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.276020507654354E-5,8.220213366595589E-5,8.28411768714344E-5,8.236251966893463E-5,8.236386908608956E-5,8.224874085655319E-5,8.249336013597564E-5,8.221397023607896E-5,8.23988172117165E-5,0.19352432241225753,0.68362249532504,8.208125876193968E-5,8.361326475287522E-5,0.02939016673240886,8.214111155956542E-5,8.191410896776736E-5,8.395735394982546E-5,8.250108914113439E-5,8.224512983346152E-5,8.231329642315838E-5,8.310972584377145E-5,8.258282684377765E-5,8.267685992048498E-5,8.276593496408598E-5,8.340112099419319E-5,8.296495661060601E-5,8.645264577626398E-5,8.210566076756951E-5,8.210785728627645E-5,8.231587707839E-5,8.40654817753358E-5,8.249630890751716E-5,8.855279920791353E-5,0.0871722631948496,8.219502908692648E-5,8.257441332968368E-5,8.211266761374263E-5,8.21611901588885E-5,8.191369742466088E-5,8.19349496169269E-5,8.211937523071417E-5,8.298556063346719E-5,8.256387612673086E-5,8.22374416403514E-5,8.323671278750537E-5,8.226900481983738E-5,8.500239531805993E-5,8.375241031813093E-5,8.195531493112202E-5,8.213644118903127E-5,8.210795317672248E-5,8.441877962637632E-5,8.213766322269001E-5,8.192767566570439E-5,8.28269491536723E-5,8.215881970427353E-5,8.835278110410528E-5,8.209111016132835E-5,8.19543671649211E-5,8.23456752145273E-5,8.316247510608833E-5,8.23402275797219E-5,8.193920542377642E-5,8.212998831401759E-5,8.191468818533129E-5,8.381002428607608E-5,8.262034477160596E-5,8.244435134055945E-5,8.237225002920034E-5,8.267250997436917E-5,8.191169980759377E-5,8.237397692483532E-5,8.371002814703605E-5,8.205849012350913E-5,8.408939499888053E-5,8.227544443467993E-5,8.291937331830011E-5,8.2

{"value":"Well this just maybe the worst movie ever at least the worst movie i have ever seen. They have tried out these 666 child of Satan the anti Christ kinda movies about 1000 times and none of them is good and this just maybe the worst of them. They think that it's going to be better movie as more they use that fake blood. This movie doesn't have any idea in it, actors and filming is just terrible. Cant even make out that 10 line minium of this movie. Really nothing to tell about but that it's just horrible. How they can make movies like that in their right mind just can't understand that.

{"value":"OMG this is one of the worst films iv ever seen and iv seen a lot I'm a Film student. I don't understand why Angelina Jolie would be in this movie? Did she need the money that badly? I love AJ and have seen almost everything shes ever been in so i watched this 2 tick another one off. It was SOO bad! not even good bad, just bad bad. It had 1 or 2 funny little moments but all in all it was bad n a waste of 101 minutes. I cant even say AJ looked good in it because well she didn't. The plot is predictable unless you r expecting a re-telling of Romeo and Juliet then its not. All round disappointing. Maybe if your 12 this could be a good film otherwise I really don't recommend it.","finished_norm":["omg","thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","film","iv","ever","see","and","iv","see","a","lot","i","be","a","film","student","i","do","not","understand","why","angelina","joli","would","be","in","thi","movi","do","she","ne","the","monei","that","badli","i","love","aj","and","have","see","almost","everyth","she","ever","be","in","so","i","watch","thi","tick","anoth","on","off","it","be","soo","bad","not","even","good","bad","just","bad","bad","it","have","or","funni","littl","moment","but","all","in","all","it","be","bad","n","a","wast","of","minut","i","cant","even","sai","aj","look","good","in","it","becaus","good","she","do","not","the","plot","be","predict","unless","you","r","expect","a","retel","of","romeo","and","juliet","then","it","not","all","round","disappoint","mayb","if","your","thi","can","be","a","good","film","otherwis","i","realli","do","not","recommend","it"],"filtered":["omg","thi","wrong","film","iv","ever","see","iv","see","lot","film","student","understand","angelina","joli","thi","movi","ne","monei","badli","love","aj","see","almost","everyth","ever","watch","thi","tick","anoth","soo","bad","even","good","bad","bad","bad","funni","littl","moment","bad","n","wast","minut","cant","even","sai","aj","look","good","becaus","good","plot","predict","unless","r","expect","retel","romeo","juliet","round","disappoint","mayb","thi","good","film","otherwis","realli","recommend"],"filtered2":["omg","wrong","iv","ever","see","iv","see","lot","student","understand","angelina","joli","ne","monei","badli","love","aj","see","almost","everyth","ever","watch","tick","anoth","soo","bad","even","good","bad","bad","bad","funni","littl","moment","bad","n","wast","minut","cant","even","aj","look","good","becaus","good","plot","predict","unless","r","expect","retel","romeo","juliet","round","disappoint","mayb","good","otherwis","realli","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,9,13,14,16,22,25,32,44,54,59,62,72,73,89,110,126,130,131,163,187,188,193,212,298,337,448,460,626,627,1454,1480,1601,2415,3026,4123,4837,5177,5233,5489,5497,8063],"values":[3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,9,13,14,16,22,25,32,44,54,59,62,72,73,89,110,126,130,131,163,187,188,193,212,298,337,448,460,626,627,1454,1480,1601,2415,3026,4123,4837,5177,5233,5489,5497,8063],"values":[1.967100616408184,2.714457859969082,1.852034211452262,0.9609497720722932,5.341785428361037,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,3.209458785004948,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,2.0226120445069267,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,1.9940046109572438,2.1290479736304078,2.2391270689902285,2.2642139034199635,2.2512118082053005,2.4000574358028657,2.4732161909892554,2.5378812223426954,2.517840471459249,2.5983793339432615,2.7819920465008363,2.973659465713028,3.2681460658591432,3.216957819005698,3.6528204042982337,3.477726550625732,4.637773374493822,4.5432147918688095,4.724033718778229,5.243909178064138,11.43998370677251,5.822646007446338,6.1754673820690815,6.489124940924123,6.437831646536572,6.543192162194399,6.342521466732247,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.10647974345058907,8.076650011492615E-5,8.139438263849253E-5,8.092408502848393E-5,8.092541087850677E-5,8.081229332608572E-5,8.105264040928765E-5,8.077812996319857E-5,8.095974864647682E-5,8.98204217047211E-5,0.6048051574266213,8.064773625182753E-5,0.06816410419765329,8.332491665690411E-5,8.070654373979326E-5,8.048350567449133E-5,8.249106604693654E-5,8.106023442988302E-5,8.080874536833887E-5,8.087572145069895E-5,8.16582414902988E-5,8.114054461011213E-5,8.123293542969293E-5,8.132045480660439E-5,8.194454751911388E-5,8.151600060474455E-5,8.494277841252794E-5,8.067171208435904E-5,8.067387024158056E-5,8.087825703562559E-5,0.040667813976683745,8.105553768149246E-5,8.700625334698617E-5,8.128353494790112E-5,8.075951961506069E-5,8.113227803530765E-5,8.067859655824076E-5,8.072627167290416E-5,8.048310131885146E-5,8.050398234848593E-5,8.068518702886168E-5,8.15362447850422E-5,8.112192486118008E-5,8.080119144702296E-5,8.178301064832769E-5,8.083220338583639E-5,8.351785610728467E-5,8.228970168916848E-5,8.05239919890868E-5,8.070195493576276E-5,0.12103453782238975,8.294443307399717E-5,8.070315562700076E-5,8.049683543445768E-5,8.138040340319753E-5,8.072394261750871E-5,8.680972849436051E-5,8.065741559972732E-5,8.052306077531459E-5,8.090753475699883E-5,8.171006950389139E-5,8.090218226336498E-5,8.050816382905184E-5,8.069561475811418E-5,8.048407477620873E-5,8.234630944788642E-5,8.117740729952322E-5,8.100448753655687E-5,8.093364545116969E-5,8.122866145397242E-5,8.048113858951725E-5,8.09353421871336E-5,8.224805970891872E-5,8.062536526026798E-5,8.262080104197959E-5,0.05282090547421813,8.1471

{"value":"If, in the first 10 minutes of this film, you don't realize that the main character, who writes a life advice column, is going to have the tables-oh-so-cleverly-turned and learn some valuable life lessons himself, then there is probably something wrong with you. The set up is so predictable as to ruin the movie, even if the rest of the movie was good (which it isn't) <br /><br />There's almost no chemistry between the leads, and Steve Carell's stalker-ish behavior is embarrassing, not funny. It's hard to believe Binoche's character would have any interest in him. Then in the end it's all wrapped up so wonderful and everyone lives happily ever after.

{"value":"Umm.. I was quite surprised that someone actually gave this film high marks.<br /><br />Lets face it... Tori Spelling is not a great actress.. and this movie just proves the extent of her \"talent\". The movie's plot was weak... I bet the dork that came up with this concept was some perverted peeping tom. If there is a good thing about this movie, I would say it's that Tommy Chong's daughter, just for the fact that she's his daughter... and then there is that Soap-Opera-ish male lead who's decent good looks somewhat make him attractive, but ceases to help his dramatic abilities. *Why does IMDb require at least 10 lines?

{"value":"a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like \"Debbie does Dallas\". Nowhere close. I think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever. Even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time. But I read somewhere that back in those days, porn had to have some \"artistic\" value. I was unable to find it though. See it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream, or can appreciate art in porn movies. I know I am not. But the director of the movie appears to be a talented person. He even tried to get Simon & Garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs. Of course, they

{"value":"Dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy, spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor. To much. Calm down, get yourself together and make us laugh. I didn't quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars. Just because there both up on stage or something? He said that every comedian wants to be a rock star. I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really into that when he was alive. He had a few good jokes like the Burger King joke where people yell at the drive thru. I also liked the Reese's Pieces joke. If Dane just didn't act so mental he might be funnier and I might have given this a higher rating, as high as maybe an eight.","finished_norm":["dane","try","to","hard","and","be","to","extrem","with","all","of","hi","yell","and","go","crazi","spill","water","on","himself","and","roll","on","the","floor","to","much","calm","down","get","yourself","togeth","and","make","u","laugh","i","do","not","quit","understand","hi","comparison","toward","comic","and","rock","star","just","becaus","there","both","up","on","stage","or","someth","he","sai","that","everi","comedian","want","to","be","a","rock","star","i","be","sure","rodnei","dangerfield","be","realli","into","that","when","he","be","aliv","he","have","a","few","good","joke","like","the","burger","king","joke","where","peopl","yell","at","the","drive","thru","i","conjur","like","the","rees","piec","joke","if","dane","just","do","not","act","so","mental","he","mai","be","funni","and","i","mai","have","give","thi","a","high","rate","a","high","a","mayb","a","eight"],"filtered":["dane","try","hard","extrem","hi","yell","go","crazi","spill","water","roll","floor","much","calm","get","togeth","make","u","laugh","quit","understand","hi","comparison","toward","comic","rock","star","becaus","stage","someth","sai","everi","comedian","want","rock","star","sure","rodnei","dangerfield","realli","aliv","good","joke","like","burger","king","joke","peopl","yell","drive","thru","conjur","like","rees","piec","joke","dane","act","mental","mai","funni","mai","give","thi","high","rate","high","mayb","eight"],"filtered2":["dane","try","hard","extrem","yell","go","crazi","spill","water","roll","floor","calm","get","togeth","make","u","laugh","quit","understand","comparison","toward","comic","rock","star","becaus","stage","someth","everi","comedian","want","rock","star","sure","rodnei","dangerfield","realli","aliv","good","joke","like","burger","king","joke","peopl","yell","drive","thru","conjur","like","rees","piec","joke","dane","act","mental","mai","funni","mai","give","high","rate","high","mayb","eight"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,13,21,22,23,30,36,37,39,46,53,62,85,100,112,119,120,133,163,171,202,211,212,214,218,270,329,461,480,541,563,582,669,712,795,830,911,1048,1237,1527,1634,1662,2208,3605,3674,4197,4451,4555,5426],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,13,21,22,23,30,36,37,39,46,53,62,85,100,112,119,120,133,163,171,202,211,212,214,218,270,329,461,480,541,563,582,669,712,795,830,911,1048,1237,1527,1634,1662,2208,3605,3674,4197,4451,4555,5426],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.1317941569733974,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,3.311542587503466,1.7003182735607676,2.0226120445069267,2.011190219103739,4.281092480635563,2.2466628996789315,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.3212364753796515,2.4000574358028657,2.373087554090762,2.597304642813496,5.137432284239405,2.5983793339432615,8.191127420549101,2.5940874818617203,2.731603554088023,2.951986790814132,3.358217889001879,3.43462735814388,3.8023521382691974,3.459754308221302,7.419957636276365,3.7099788181381825,3.7165362186843414,3.784589681929357,3.9571003681590526,3.969732115064953,4.160564361526816,4.429617614145104,4.535724120139652,4.828393734102471,9.55920713986608,5.039114765418124,5.719991853386255,11.999153431210834,6.342521466732247,5.967828017290836,5.967828017290836,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.649209264735435E-5,6.604372092205093E-5,6.655714787628624E-5,6.617257996680002E-5,6.617366413002077E-5,6.608116657159183E-5,6.627770121980401E-5,6.605323078632111E-5,6.620174252838733E-5,7.344721952451227E-5,0.6798556996857051,6.594660630870322E-5,6.717746701272605E-5,6.81357683409724E-5,6.599469388607514E-5,6.581231302620335E-5,6.74539188501932E-5,6.628391094012325E-5,6.60782653646441E-5,6.613303249811588E-5,6.677290837533856E-5,6.634958152288595E-5,6.642513058710777E-5,0.20966013347875673,6.70070241961115E-5,6.665659632348683E-5,6.94587130040052E-5,6.596621163009676E-5,6.596797638074264E-5,6.613510587585331E-5,6.754079206884872E-5,6.628007035350001E-5,0.1053595762864308,6.646650641068037E-5,6.603801288487767E-5,6.634282184704769E-5,6.597184114568915E-5,6.601082564994867E-5,6.581198237982156E-5,6.582905704433942E-5,6.597723025134328E-5,6.667315022878136E-5,6.633435593430211E-5,6.607208843397923E-5,6.687493358926778E-5,6.609744726256944E-5,6.829353720798601E-5,6.728926083691842E-5,6.58454191637542E-5,6.599094156682984E-5,6.596805342207448E-5,6.782464242206825E-5,6.599192338623423E-5,6.582321292834005E-5,6.65457168905036E-5,6.60089211538478E-5,7.09853401328829E-5,6.595452122578507E-5,6.584465769925589E-5,6.615904661436317E-5,6.681528875409438E-5,6.615466981711074E-5,6.5832476

{"value":"What an appalling film. Don't get me wrong, Gene Hackman and Denzel Washington are good actors, but aside from a few interesting set pieces, the film is mostly taken up with hysterical submariners shouting, crying, sweating and generally freaking out when anything goes wrong.<br /><br />Take that with simplistic asides to make sure the audience still understand what's going on (the scene where Denzel Washington explains

{"value":"This movie is an insult to ALL submariners. It was stupid. It appeared to have been written by monkeys. The acting was absurd. If this is the view most people have of the Navy, then I weep for our defense. This movie was awful. I put it below \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\" as far as submarine movies go. Gene Hackman must have really needed rent money to do this crap. Denzel Washington must have been high. Little in the plot makes any sense. And the ending. For a mutineer to be rewarded for his crime? Only Hollywood would think of this garbage. If you haven't figured it out yet, I didn't like it.

{"value":"I have never commented on IMDb before, but I feel I have to after watching The Batman animation. Its absolute rubbish! Warner Brothers had the perfect animation series in Batman in the early 90s so what the hell are they doing trying to mess with the winning formula? I feel like writing a complaint letter to WB. The original animation was dark and brooding, exactly the way Batman was intended to be. WB had to mess this up with some tripe Batman of the Future. Now they produce this drivel.

{"value":"I have seen it. It's not \"good\" but interesting in an understated way. The boys in it are quite naturalistic but................the graphic/gratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and -oh yes- the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance. Real atrocity is real- this film is just atrocious. However, the film has a look which can draw you in. But it seems to me that is the \"Emperor's New Clothes\", but in fact in reverse. The film looks good, but the direction, story, content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous.

{"value":"I am a kind person, so I gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. It was without a doubt the worst movie that I've seen in a long time. There was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas that were touched upon i.e. what Jesus may really have wanted us to know, were glossed over and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted upon our heroine (Arquette). Total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humane to both her character and the audience. The acting was barely there and the direction was uninspired. And, if I saw one more drip of water or dove flying toward the camera, I may have started screaming louder than

{"value":"Can I give this a minus rating? No? Well, let me say that this is the most atrocious film I have ever tried to watch. It was Painful. Boringus Maximus. The plot(?) is well hidden in several sub-levels of nebulosity. I rented this film with a friend and, after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better, we decided to \"fast forward\" a little to see if things would get any better. It never gets better. This film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls, sounds interesting, but, in reality, it is just a bore. Nothing even remotely interesting ever happens.

{"value":"With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be at least tolerable. It wasn't. After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the fast forward was at the ready. So trite, so standard, one knows what's going to happen in each scene. One can even predict the dialogue word for word. This is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say, \"How did this movie ever get made?\" In an effort to say something positive, I'll add that there are some mildly entertaining special effects. But, on the whole, if you've seen 5 Sci/fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and skip this one.","finished_norm":["with","on","of","my","veri","favorit","actor","jame","spader","i","expect","thi","film","to","be","at","littl","toler","it","be","not","after","the","half","hour","i","watch","the","rest","of","it","with","the","remot","control","in","my","hand","so","the","fast","forward","be","at","the","readi","so","trite","so","standard","on","know","what","go","to","happen","in","each","scene","on","can","even","predict","the","dialogu","word","for","word","thi","be","on","of","that","movi","that","make","on","scratch","on","head","and","sai","how","do","thi","movi","ever","get","make","in","a","effort","to","sai","someth","posit","i","will","add","that","there","be","some","mildli","entertain","special","effect","but","on","the","whole","if","you","have","see","scifi","movi","or","you","be","over","year","old","do","yourself","a","favor","and","skip","thi","on"],"filtered":["veri","favorit","actor","jame","spader","expect","thi","film","littl","toler","half","hour","watch","rest","remot","control","hand","fast","forward","readi","trite","standard","know","go","happen","scene","even","predict","dialogu","word","word","thi","movi","make","scratch","head","sai","thi","movi","ever","get","make","effort","sai","someth","posit","add","mildli","entertain","special","effect","whole","see","scifi","movi","year","old","favor","skip","thi"],"filtered2":["veri","favorit","actor","jame","spader","expect","littl","toler","half","hour","watch","rest","remot","control","hand","fast","forward","readi","trite","standard","know","go","happen","scene","even","predict","dialogu","word","word","make","scratch","head","ever","get","make","effort","someth","posit","add","mildli","entertain","special","effect","whole","see","scifi","year","old","favor","skip"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,7,14,15,19,26,41,44,53,57,67,94,106,111,130,174,195,203,206,208,226,235,248,258,299,337,401,509,542,616,620,699,781,822,823,883,931,1115,1334,1560,1673,1753,2490,7678],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,7,14,15,19,26,41,44,53,57,67,94,106,111,130,174,195,203,206,208,226,235,248,258,299,337,401,509,542,616,620,699,781,822,823,883,931,1115,1334,1560,1673,1753,2490,7678],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,1.3324924169710188,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.7003182735607676,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,2.08112281984698,2.159084361316692,2.1183455303375887,2.2642139034199635,2.456282578459816,2.51289241584188,2.569760528637609,2.597304642813496,2.6289494000279396,2.5940874818617203,2.6457189377809835,2.689504733779216,5.412264390479415,2.7949961309240425,2.973659465713028,3.0879275592619675,3.360519385990158,3.4471119148061256,3.5173618574831282,3.7568101178222815,3.5813614403160887,3.9363956947973615,3.813163054373413,3.9081109809587793,3.8614098879127985,3.9241755834625858,4.1554492608600455,4.383707912841026,4.573751515728891,4.654440426979034,4.715065048795469,5.156897801074508,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.124789021574582E-5,9.063258436000572E-5,9.133716628078142E-5,9.080941916096363E-5,9.08109069710566E-5,9.068397147059774E-5,9.095367830775156E-5,9.064563485994251E-5,9.084943929136081E-5,0.10892290350055413,0.6340612896256957,9.049931282012361E-5,9.218843761556678E-5,9.350352593527401E-5,9.056530397495229E-5,9.031502055001489E-5,9.2567815762814E-5,9.096219998086184E-5,9.067999010976943E-5,9.075514769894272E-5,9.163325698189432E-5,9.10523205032842E-5,9.11559973833995E-5,9.125420774660424E-5,9.195453690949349E-5,9.147364056864015E-5,9.531901864377018E-5,9.052621743604011E-5,9.052863922435784E-5,9.075799301989187E-5,9.268703291485356E-5,9.09569294981231E-5,9.763455869819778E-5,9.12127779185973E-5,9.062475115264833E-5,9.104304411966884E-5,9.053394288729741E-5,9.058744178653725E-5,9.031456680004936E-5,9.03379985654122E-5,9.054133842113474E-5,9.149635768992207E-5,9.103142624683574E-5,9.067151343429211E-5,9.177326739740682E-5,9.070631365662038E-5,9.372003402944803E-5,9.234185361122216E-5,9.036045249664844E-5,9.056015462258695E-5,9.052874494909456E-5,9.307656413333457E-5,9.056150198504248E-5,9.032997861546195E-5,9.132147940292537E-5,9.058482822386824E-5,0.24999258801803373,9.051017455504872E-5,9.035940752985346E-5,9.07908471803229E-5,9.16914160801276E-5,9.078484084935503E-5,9.034269083745075E-5,9.055303995642245E-5,9.031565917072196E-5,9.2405376327449E-5,9.109368617844695E-5,9.089964328959752E-5,9.082014744328801E-5,9.115120131740072E-5,9.031236431223939E-5,9.082205144513491E-5,9.22951248278462E-5,9.047420908556965E-5,9.271339862038432E-5,9.071341370268287E-5,9.142338236485546E-5,9.086464287036134E-5,9.028404

{"value":"I'm amazed how many comments on this show are about how \"real\" it is. Maybe I'm not part of the same universe because if Veronica Mars is anything, it's over the top in a big way.<br /><br />The acting is chewing the scenery with enthusiasm and the plots have holes you could drive a truck through. That's not what I call real.<br /><br />It is so earnest in its desire to be \"relevant\" that it only shows how cut-off from reality Rob Thomas and his staff are.<br /><br />Overall, I found it to be at best a snooze-fest and at worst more than a little annoying. Kristen Bell looks like she could be a good actress, but it's hard to tell with the over-the-top style of the whole

{"value":"This was the WORST movie I have ever seen! Molly (molly hall) could not act AT ALL! she had no emotion it was all blah blah blah like she was reading out of a boring text book. The smart kid and the kid who loves food (there names weren't worth remembering) were so annoying it drove me crazy.When ever the talked it was about some scientific thing or food. Mollys Dad didn't show enough emotion about his daughter missing. The police officer and Mollys dad said the same thing like four times. it was just horrible. Everything was repeated way to much.

director?","finished_norm":["a","realli","bad","sequel","part","have","a","lot","of","funni","moment","part","be","just","bad","in","a","bore","wai","and","obvious","make","to","squeez","monei","out","of","the","fansbr","br","shame","on","you","otto","waalkesbr","br","the","onli","slightli","amus","moment","in","the","film","be","helg","schneider","who","appar","seem","to","be","pise","about","the","other","charact","it","quit","easi","to","identifi","with","himbr","br","the","screenplai","be","sloppynonexist","the","director","should","do","everyon","a","favor","and","quit","hi","job","immedi","the","act","be","wrong","than","a","nd","grade","school","plai","br","br","technic","the","movi","be","aw","a","good","but","who","can","blame","the","cinematographersound","gui","who","have","to","work","with","such","a","untal","director"],"filtered":["realli","bad","sequel","part","lot","funni","moment","part","bad","bore","wai","obvious","make","squeez","monei","fansbr","br","shame","otto","waalkesbr","br","onli","slightli","amus","moment","film","helg","schneider","appar","seem","pise","charact","quit","easi","identifi","himbr","br","screenplai","sloppynonexist","director","everyon","favor","quit","hi","job","immedi","act","wrong","nd","grade","school","plai","br","br","technic","movi","aw","good","blame","cinematographersound","gui","work","untal","director"],"filtered2":["realli","bad","sequel","part","lot","funni","moment","part","bad","bore","wai","obvious","make","squeez","monei","fansbr","shame","otto","waalkesbr","onli","slightli","amus","moment","helg","schneider","appar","seem","pise","charact","quit","easi","identifi","himbr","screenplai","sloppynonexist","director","everyon","favor","quit","job","immedi","act","wrong","nd","grade","school","plai","technic","aw","good","blame","cinematographersound","gui","work","untal","director"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,9,10,11,13,21,25,33,35,40,48,55,58,61,62,72,108,120,126,138,188,246,289,296,308,341,387,574,703,708,744,898,938,944,965,987,1115,1909,2451,2912,3995,4185,5056,6841,8187],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,9,10,11,13,21,25,33,35,40,48,55,58,61,62,72,108,120,126,138,188,246,289,296,308,341,387,574,703,708,744,898,938,944,965,987,1115,1909,2451,2912,3995,4185,5056,6841,8187],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.6284968758320737,1.6955116224012472,1.9536997889255368,3.731402629253362,3.7637034094785053,2.0226120445069267,1.9209463754160525,2.138507503627933,4.4089000845945225,2.2391270689902285,2.2907365189289424,5.075762444685391,2.673149229007135,2.8282659991423613,2.9504565686333644,2.8753661172782943,2.933776879434709,3.360519385990158,3.5039747767006686,3.6746621462132825,3.6683728173057184,3.700222643192818,3.892300374932137,3.952924996748572,3.969732115064953,3.9868265484242533,4.035401218572811,4.1554492608600455,4.789173020949191,5.143104478942172,5.408212229355414,5.7959777603641776,6.214688095222362,6.137727054086234,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.281449535423636E-5,8.225605785161419E-5,8.289552026621683E-5,8.241654906700308E-5,0.06457901744565045,8.230269561629377E-5,8.254747536473146E-5,8.226790218646764E-5,8.245287042079018E-5,9.147695880701562E-5,0.7184164438003786,8.213510365426975E-5,8.366811463341912E-5,8.486165867356407E-5,8.219499571502927E-5,8.196784421067434E-5,8.401242955114947E-5,8.255520944007867E-5,8.229908222438916E-5,8.236729353102551E-5,8.316424540532714E-5,8.263700076224318E-5,8.273109552417519E-5,0.04255305764255131,8.345583170949989E-5,8.301938120427389E-5,8.650935827645814E-5,8.215952166749238E-5,8.216171962710452E-5,8.236987587915397E-5,8.412062830796874E-5,8.255042607065226E-5,8.861088939818102E-5,8.278262823750405E-5,8.224894861201673E-5,8.262858172892634E-5,8.216653311012129E-5,8.221508748581238E-5,8.196743239759765E-5,8.198869853119476E-5,8.217324512725577E-5,8.30399987432703E-5,8.261803761362143E-5,8.229138898786307E-5,8.329131565185655E-5,8.232297287263582E-5,8.505815646125796E-5,8.38073514774648E-5,8.200907720493341E-5,8.219032228075559E-5,8.21618155804542E-5,8.447415792062011E-5,8.219154511606225E-5,8.198141980829688E-5,8.288128321514354E-5,8.221271547619113E-5,0.06136277555009223,8.21449615161268E-5,8.200812881700264E-5,8.239969356271848E-5,8.321702927089441E-5,8.23942423542921E-5,8.199295712983213E-5,8.218386517268838E-5,8.196842380820206E-5,0.10687221915001115,8.267454330164316E-5,8.249843441979232E-5,8.24262858103361E-5,8.272674272451665E-5,8.196543347010381E-5,8.242801383880592E-5,8.376494150387914E-5,8.211232007972706E-5,8.414455721846767E-5,8.232941671183326E-5,8.297

{"value":"It is not often I watch a film that is as dreadful as this one. I continued to watch, every minute hoping that this was intended as a joke only to find it was meant to be taken seriously. Well, as seriously as this genre requests.<br /><br />The acting was disgraceful and the situations horribly contrived and clichéd. If a film was made in 1920 (for example) and had the quality of Hide & Seek (Cord) in its direction we would think that cinema back then was naive. As it happens, this film was made in 2000 and I have yet to see a film from the silent era that has as little charm as this one.<br /><br />Definitely not for the serious movie-goer.<br /><br />[Not

{"value":"Steven Seagal appears to be sleepwalking through a dreadful movie shot almost entirely in close-up to disguise the complete lack of budget and resources. To pick on the technical flaws - silver F/A-18s and F-14s take of from a carrier for an air-strike, and miraculously become camouflaged F-16s for the actual strike - would give this movie more credibility than it deserves. Suffice it to say that the most interesting thing in the movie is the credit titles which fade on and then disappear in a lightning wipe, which presumably is available to all users of Final Cut Pro. Putting all your creativity into your own credit puts Michael Keusch in the same category as Marcel Mandu.","finished_norm":["steven","seagal","appear","to","be","sleepwalk","through","a","dread","movi","shoot","almost","entir","in","closeup","to","disguis","the","complet","lack","of","budget","and","resourc","to","pick","on","the","technic","flaw","silver","fa","and","f","take","of","from","a","carrier","for","a","airstrik","and","miracul","becom","camouflag","f","for","the","actual","strike","would","give","thi","movi","much","credibl","than","it","deserv","suffic","it","to","sai","that","the","much","interest","thing","in","the","movi","be","the","credit","titl","which","fade","on","and","then","disappear","in","a","lightn","wipe","which","presum","be","avail","to","all","user","of","final","cut","pro","putt","all","your","creativ","into","your","own","credit","put","michael","keusch","in","the","same","categori","a","marcel","mandu"],"filtered":["steven","seagal","appear","sleepwalk","dread","movi","shoot","almost","entir","closeup","disguis","complet","lack","budget","resourc","pick","technic","flaw","silver","fa","f","take","carrier","airstrik","miracul","becom","camouflag","f","actual","strike","give","thi","movi","much","credibl","deserv","suffic","sai","much","interest","thing","movi","credit","titl","fade","disappear","lightn","wipe","presum","avail","user","final","cut","pro","putt","creativ","credit","put","michael","keusch","categori","marcel","mandu"],"filtered2":["steven","seagal","appear","sleepwalk","dread","shoot","almost","entir","closeup","disguis","complet","lack","budget","resourc","pick","technic","flaw","silver","fa","f","take","carrier","airstrik","miracul","becom","camouflag","f","actual","strike","give","credibl","deserv","suffic","interest","thing","credit","titl","fade","disappear","lightn","wipe","presum","avail","user","final","cut","pro","putt","creativ","credit","put","michael","keusch","categori","marcel","mandu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[29,30,31,52,60,103,115,117,131,156,159,169,183,198,256,264,303,356,423,446,466,921,944,995,1056,1096,1128,1194,1203,1208,1213,1401,1473,1586,1607,1946,2107,2165,2276,2332,2538,2903,3044,3161,3333,4052,4431,5388],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[29,30,31,52,60,103,115,117,131,156,159,169,183,198,256,264,303,356,423,446,466,921,944,995,1056,1096,1128,1194,1203,1208,1213,1401,1473,1586,1607,1946,2107,2165,2276,2332,2538,2903,3044,3161,3333,4052,4431,5388],"values":[1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.7122153074726136,1.838176641236591,2.098582041218749,2.201553588425805,2.2797301185117202,2.2512118082053005,2.3451551414151686,2.300267965194495,2.4214486257841834,2.4885128563647294,2.5439726117360975,2.748952192422636,2.757740698455715,2.868298950055202,6.056670924119444,3.164467636384302,3.233054746047873,3.4446025032006995,3.9911462095687695,3.969732115064953,4.030886538218284,4.100845126825194,8.859235228290208,4.251780369798478,4.499089986959872,4.3521595551061,4.297765483040301,4.251780369798478,5.583416318380505,4.535724120139652,4.589376833631972,4.597282013139085,4.911775343041523,5.156897801074508,4.9909126636002465,5.064116067623542,5.143104478942172,5.214056214914456,5.373120909544144,5.444579873526289,5.604922523601468,5.541743621979936,5.822646007446338,6.0662680901040895,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.484664020893743E-5,6.440936415410165E-5,6.491008554290564E-5,6.453503437712844E-5,6.453609171100837E-5,6.444588315157171E-5,6.463755423776835E-5,6.441863868167644E-5,6.456347526481192E-5,7.162965142506159E-5,0.5937334123718417,6.431465279610319E-5,6.551505389709432E-5,6.644964053695413E-5,6.43615503699981E-5,6.418368281416967E-5,6.578466449476959E-5,6.46436102886957E-5,6.444305373959775E-5,6.449646557336803E-5,0.051243175573222964,6.470765574858685E-5,6.478133523122394E-5,6.485112985411844E-5,6.534882895868217E-5,6.500707298033156E-5,6.773984683313746E-5,6.433377295268077E-5,6.433549403176907E-5,6.449848764208031E-5,6.586938789765336E-5,6.463986474348827E-5,0.06660247080098113,6.482168714432722E-5,6.4403797371374E-5,6.470106335166323E-5,6.433926315696876E-5,6.437728292775335E-5,6.418336035015775E-5,6.420001247498333E-5,6.434451890064425E-5,6.50232172329479E-5,6.469280694137452E-5,6.443702966689266E-5,6.522000714369728E-5,6.446176095099333E-5,6.660350516277759E-5,6.562408120555086E-5,6.421596968776611E-5,6.435789090785214E-5,6.433556916659077E-5,0.15988952186988192,6.4358848430576E-5,6.419431298091626E-5,6.489893743502143E-5,0.06700356580345425,0.05673009887524812,6.432237184599101E-5,6.421522706691621E-5,6.452183592899195E-5,6.516183831470098E-5,6.451756744253897E-5,6.42033471063477E-5,6.435283476687304E-5,6.418413665926268E-5,6.566922454765462E-5,6.473705286722638E-5,6.459915346628056E-5,6.454265858698473E-5,6.477792683717224E-5,6.4181795120164

{"value":"If you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one. A setting and acting as in a Porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind. Which actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of touchy feely but no action. A few of the actors I've seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better. All the special effects are done by the great \"Rondo\" Whom performs all the magic whit his mind. A cult movie is written on the box. Does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all???<br /><br />Get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks

{"value":"Once upon a time there was a science fiction author named H. Beam Piper who wrote a classic book named \"Little Fuzzy\" which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet.

{"value":"This Movie is complete crap! Avoid this waste of celluloid at all costs, it is rambling and incoherent. I pride myself on plumbing the depths of 70's sleaze cinema from everything from Salo to Salon Kitty. I like being shocked, but I need a coherent story. However if watching horses mate gets you off this film is for you. The saddest part was that lame werewolf suit with the functional wang. I mean its just plain hard to sit through, not to mention the acting is terrible and the soundtrack is dubbed badly. Please, I know the cover is interesting (what looks like a gorillas hands reaching for a woman's bare ass)but don't waste your time or money as you won't get either

{"value":"Creepy & lascivious wolf. The young \"Red\" is wearing full make-up, and extremely short shorts & robe. Got about 20 minutes through and realized it could be a pedophile's dream come true. The \"up-beat\" music sounds a lot like something I'd hear at a strip club. I actually think this movie is a sick joke - it's not a family movie. Gross, glad I was watching this with my daughter, I don't want her to think it's normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together. Very bad, Very sad it's sold as a family film, Joey Fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it. And what's with advertising it as a \"special effects spectacular\"???

{"value":"I've been reading posts here concerning Wonder Woman's costume for this TV movie. It should be pointed out at the time the movie was made, she wasn't wearing her traditional outfit. The producers were actually sticking to the comic book writer's conception of WW for the early seventies.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, I have to agree with many of the other posters here. Snoozefest! I was a kid when it appeared on ABC in 1974, so I was at the right age to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero. Yet I was so \"engrossed\" with the plot, I stopped watching it three quarters into the movie.<br /><br />Of course, I wasn't at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee! :-)","finished_norm":["i","have","be","read","post","here","concern","wonder","woman","costum","for","thi","tv","movi","it","should","be","point","out","at","the","time","the","movi","be","make","she","be","not","wear","her","tradit","outfit","the","produc","be","actual","stick","to","the","comic","book","writer","concept","of","ww","for","the","earli","seventiesbr","br","a","for","the","movi","itself","i","have","to","agre","with","mani","of","the","other","poster","here","snoozefest","i","be","a","kid","when","it","appear","on","abc","in","so","i","be","at","the","right","ag","to","have","appreci","a","movi","about","a","comic","book","hero","yet","i","be","so","engross","with","the","plot","i","stop","watch","it","three","quarter","into","the","moviebr","br","of","cours","i","be","not","at","the","right","ag","to","appreci","cathi","lee"],"filtered":["read","post","concern","wonder","woman","costum","thi","tv","movi","point","time","movi","make","wear","tradit","outfit","produc","actual","stick","comic","book","writer","concept","ww","earli","seventiesbr","br","movi","agre","mani","poster","snoozefest","kid","appear","abc","right","ag","appreci","movi","comic","book","hero","yet","engross","plot","stop","watch","three","quarter","moviebr","br","cours","right","ag","appreci","cathi","lee"],"filtered2":["read","post","concern","wonder","woman","costum","tv","point","time","make","wear","tradit","outfit","produc","actual","stick","comic","book","writer","concept","ww","earli","seventiesbr","agre","mani","poster","snoozefest","kid","appear","abc","right","ag","appreci","comic","book","hero","yet","engross","plot","stop","watch","three","quarter","moviebr","cours","right","ag","appreci","cathi","lee"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,32,50,52,66,70,114,121,145,151,169,172,175,194,199,224,261,266,287,315,375,416,442,465,480,514,570,622,726,776,874,961,1224,1448,1942,2076,3323,4152,4261,5756],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,32,50,52,66,70,114,121,145,151,169,172,175,194,199,224,261,266,287,315,375,416,442,465,480,514,570,622,726,776,874,961,1224,1448,1942,2076,3323,4152,4261,5756],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.3711311285073675,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,1.929723173391612,2.094675786251684,2.4433074195966826,4.438119011878839,2.34599021453259,5.6004909736203725,2.4214486257841834,2.5001408943598484,2.3791142619576227,2.5378812223426954,2.558331832813986,2.689504733779216,2.7085302779237206,2.747702973022204,2.841890188081905,2.854312708080462,3.2597778161886266,3.1401446412440817,6.515393299969604,3.2681460658591432,6.86925471628776,3.405285399859865,3.944626193933877,3.4933926673701317,3.7034641371169887,3.770603439954617,3.872882289075035,7.990969222334735,4.403125998698128,4.484804029712395,4.85885294158718,4.956227105612356,5.583416318380505,6.032366538428407,6.137727054086234,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.262455996163593E-5,8.206740323776933E-5,8.270539904264077E-5,8.222752636588227E-5,8.222887357132392E-5,8.211393403853993E-5,8.235815238359744E-5,8.20792204075911E-5,8.226376441649205E-5,9.126715601813689E-5,0.8370043308411294,8.194672644938405E-5,8.347622146141993E-5,8.466702810330047E-5,8.20064811474509E-5,8.177985061602439E-5,8.381974669144166E-5,0.1565390663717329,8.21103289339648E-5,8.217838379768317E-5,8.297350785951691E-5,8.244747245423428E-5,8.254135140943498E-5,8.263028045781383E-5,8.326442540927749E-5,8.282897590511666E-5,8.631094870024124E-5,8.197108845979089E-5,8.197328137837344E-5,8.218096022318535E-5,8.392769729395814E-5,8.236109632206181E-5,8.840765995151803E-5,8.259276593226957E-5,8.206031030324272E-5,8.243907273000568E-5,8.19780838216467E-5,8.202652683767341E-5,8.177943974744271E-5,8.180065710707318E-5,8.198478044474173E-5,8.284954615770086E-5,8.242855279767349E-5,8.210265334190897E-5,8.31002866699027E-5,8.213416478890946E-5,8.486307522249374E-5,8.361513896517954E-5,8.18209890422381E-5,8.200181843171833E-5,8.197337711165371E-5,8.428041608495941E-5,8.200303846244709E-5,8.179339507795681E-5,8.269119464430386E-5,8.202416026826617E-5,8.820796968013418E-5,8.195656170219357E-5,8.182004282943904E-5,8.22107095197675E-5,8.302617066506703E-5,8.22052708137105E-5,8.180490593859671E-5,8.199537613305559E-5,8.178042888424274E-5,8.367265850303844E-5,8.248492888966264E-5,8.23092239142713E-5,8.223724077795361E-5,8.253700859294072E-5,8.177744540449746E-5,8.223896484318288E-5,8.357282625904625E-5,8.192399512906518E-5,8.395157132340044E-5,8.214059384913467E-5,8.278346732445409E-5,8.227753118985844E-5,8.175180576682785E-5,8.185314274483744E-5]}}
{"value":"Like watching a neighbor's summer camp home movies, \"Indian Summer\" is a sleep inducing bore. Eight alumni campers are barely introduced, when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about. Fine actors, Alan Arkin, and Bill Paxton are totally wasted in this film. One camper's observation that \"everything seems so much smaller than I remember it\" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you squirm. The anticipated pranks are neither funny or original, unless you think that short sheeting is a real \"howler\". This movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved. \"Indian Summer\" did not make me homesick, just sick. -

{"value":"I've always thought that Cinderella II was the worst movie I've ever seen, (followed by Peter Pan 2, and some other sequels like The Lion King 2 and the Hunchback of Notre Dame 2). All these movies are made with the same idea; because the movie has no plot, they try to make up for that by filling it with jokes. I'm not saying the jokes are bad, but they make up most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would have given it a 1/10. But now I think about it, most kids don't care how good the original movie was, they just care that the movie is entertaining. I still think the movie was a bad sequel, but that doesn't mean it's horrible. Now I think it deserves a 3/10.","finished_norm":["i","have","alwai","think","that","cinderella","ii","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","follow","by","peter","pan","and","some","other","sequel","like","the","lion","king","and","the","hunchback","of","notr","dame","all","thi","movi","be","make","with","the","same","idea","becaus","the","movi","have","no","plot","thei","try","to","make","up","for","that","by","fill","it","with","joke","i","be","not","sai","the","joke","be","bad","but","thei","make","up","much","of","the","movi","the","time","i","see","the","movi","i","would","have","give","it","a","but","now","i","think","about","it","much","kid","do","not","care","how","good","the","origin","movi","be","thei","just","care","that","the","movi","be","entertain","i","still","think","the","movi","be","a","bad","sequel","but","that","doe","not","mean","it","horribl","now","i","think","it","deserv","a"],"filtered":["alwai","think","cinderella","ii","wrong","movi","ever","see","follow","peter","pan","sequel","like","lion","king","hunchback","notr","dame","thi","movi","make","idea","becaus","movi","plot","thei","try","make","fill","joke","sai","joke","bad","thei","make","much","movi","time","see","movi","give","think","much","kid","care","good","origin","movi","thei","care","movi","entertain","still","think","movi","bad","sequel","doe","mean","horribl","think","deserv"],"filtered2":["alwai","think","cinderella","ii","wrong","ever","see","follow","peter","pan","sequel","like","lion","king","hunchback","notr","dame","make","idea","becaus","plot","try","make","fill","joke","joke","bad","make","time","see","give","think","kid","care","good","origin","care","entertain","still","think","bad","sequel","doe","mean","horribl","think","deserv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,8,9,12,18,22,25,30,32,36,44,64,69,88,114,123,195,197,205,214,230,260,387,423,541,553,760,1169,2381,2547,3144,4824,6103],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,8,9,12,18,22,25,30,32,36,44,64,69,88,114,123,195,197,205,214,230,260,387,423,541,553,760,1169,2381,2547,3144,4824,6103],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,4.266914441051552,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.604729392502474,1.883428577602134,2.127032521151058,2.0317223413467334,2.4433074195966826,2.2619070973220485,2.51289241584188,2.558331832813986,5.143705159219666,5.460751613699401,2.7121382192999195,2.6754694156628323,6.721038771980316,3.164467636384302,3.8023521382691974,3.454678155189441,3.850067611308864,4.528289141652134,5.116075806554253,5.463272006538442,6.437831646536572,6.255510089742618,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1281625176135654E-4,1.1205550540144308E-4,1.129266301055079E-4,1.1227413883371059E-4,1.1227597831906881E-4,1.1211903893840631E-4,1.1245249666954028E-4,1.1207164066202829E-4,1.1232361856519519E-4,1.246169232933398E-4,0.7764396429053232,1.1189073232493233E-4,1.1397911735749043E-4,1.1560505451191361E-4,1.1197232187971077E-4,1.1166287869354317E-4,1.1444816952375315E-4,1.1246303261965117E-4,1.1211411649905459E-4,1.1220703916808181E-4,1.1329270808278465E-4,1.125744550264863E-4,1.1270263812180241E-4,1.1282406257375067E-4,1.136899292909923E-4,1.1309536296696497E-4,0.09200170997771194,1.1192399641373046E-4,1.1192699064274682E-4,1.1221055704059133E-4,1.1459556616171339E-4,1.1245651634726227E-4,1.2071254391374528E-4,1.1277283993292236E-4,1.120458206504725E-4,1.1256298597413988E-4,1.1193354793817616E-4,1.1199969242953181E-4,1.1166231769021229E-4,1.1169128804705162E-4,1.1194269156226795E-4,1.1312344975853653E-4,1.1254862197226134E-4,1.1210363618271536E-4,1.1346581291017654E-4,0.12286028202865006,1.1587273885620864E-4,1.1416879645636222E-4,1.117190494380645E-4,1.1196595536941138E-4,1.119271213577528E-4,1.1507717129153237E-4,1.1196762120937369E-4,1.1168137241294149E-4,1.1290723530353086E-4,1.1199646109625535E-4,1.2043988517957236E-4,1.1190416145977565E-4,1.1171775747134892E-4,1.1225117697411343E-4,1.1336461430936134E-4,1.1224375092026132E-4,1.1169708943645779E-4,1.119571590019851E-4,1.116636682657108E-4,1.1424733410506258E-4,1.1262559835059391E-4,1.1238568933626843E-4,1.1228740297161901E-4,1.1269670840454646E-4,1.1165959459799959E-4,1.1228975702442184E-4,1.1411102234040865E-4,1.1185969479375332E-4,1.1462816395730067E-4,1.1215544046242486E-4,1.1303322517772029E-4,1.1234241583044857E-4,1.1162458602645927E-4,1.1176295236728058E-4]}}
{"value":"This bomb is just one 'explosion' after another, with no humor and only absurd situations. Really, pyrotechnics to the extreme. Reality is not one of its strong points. I give it a 1 out of 10. I would have made it a zero but that option wasn't permitted. Sorry, but Lithgow and Sutherland deserve better roles. But then at times we all need to have money. And I still recoil at that Tim Burton farce about Mars. Nicholson was brave enough to admit that was a turkey. But if that was a turkey, this movie then is not even a gizzard. I wish I could say, \"give me back my money\". You can bet I would if I could.
