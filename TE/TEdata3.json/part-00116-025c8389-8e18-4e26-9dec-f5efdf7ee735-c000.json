{"value":"To be honest at the time i first heard of this show i though it may be a bad idea to make a show that makes Muslims use racial jokes on themselves but it is the Exact opposite. I realized that the show doing that can help people understand that if a Muslim uses s a word like this in real life it doesn't mean it is a terrorist thing. It also show's how people give the Muslims a bad name because they play on their stereotype, by watching the show regular people will realize that all though there may be bad Muslims out it doesn't mean we are all bad we just try to live 1 day at a time, like how hard it was for Amair to get on a plane and how he used words like \"Blow up\" or Yaser saying we'll blow away the competition, and people took it the wrong way. Being a Muslim i know that stuff like this don't usually happen, but they do and many people think bad things about Muslims or Afghanistan or Iraq, its not right things are not like that. people will see how we are poorly treated by watching this show and it may make them think on how the act. I am glad a show like this came on the air. There are many shows that Piotr Muslim people as terrorists,many people do find them funny to my opioion it is OK to do it now and then because prety much everything is made fun of who are we to say you can not make fun of that is unfair, but it is done to often and really gives Muslin people a bad name.","finished_norm":["to","be","honest","at","the","time","i","hear","of","thi","show","i","though","it","mai","be","a","bad","idea","to","make","a","show","that","make","muslim","us","racial","joke","on","themselv","but","it","be","the","exact","opposit","i","realiz","that","the","show","do","that","can","help","peopl","understand","that","if","a","muslim","us","a","word","like","thi","in","real","life","it","doe","not","mean","it","be","a","terrorist","thing","it","conjur","show","how","peopl","give","the","muslim","a","bad","name","becaus","thei","plai","on","their","stereotyp","by","watch","the","show","regular","peopl","will","realiz","that","all","though","there","mai","be","bad","muslim","out","it","doe","not","mean","we","be","all","bad","we","just","try","to","live","dai","at","a","time","like","how","hard","it","be","for","amair","to","get","on","a","plane","and","how","he","us","word","like","blow","up","or","yaser","sai","we","will","blow","awai","the","competit","and","peopl","take","it","the","wrong","wai","be","a","muslim","i","know","that","stuff","like","thi","do","not","usual","happen","but","thei","do","and","mani","peopl","think","bad","thing","about","muslim","or","afghanistan","or","iraq","it","not","right","thing","be","not","like","that","peopl","will","see","how","we","be","poorli","treat","by","watch","thi","show","and","it","mai","make","them","think","on","how","the","act","i","be","glad","a","show","like","thi","come","on","the","air","there","be","mani","show","that","piotr","muslim","peopl","a","terroristsmani","peopl","do","find","them","funni","to","my","opioion","it","be","okai","to","do","it","now","and","then","becaus","preti","much","everyth","be","make","fun","of","who","be","we","to","sai","you","can","not","make","fun","of","that","be","unfair","but","it","be","do","to","often","and","realli","give","muslin","peopl","a","bad","name"],"filtered":["honest","time","hear","thi","show","though","mai","bad","idea","make","show","make","muslim","us","racial","joke","themselv","exact","opposit","realiz","show","help","peopl","understand","muslim","us","word","like","thi","real","life","doe","mean","terrorist","thing","conjur","show","peopl","give","muslim","bad","name","becaus","thei","plai","stereotyp","watch","show","regular","peopl","realiz","though","mai","bad","muslim","doe","mean","bad","try","live","dai","time","like","hard","amair","get","plane","us","word","like","blow","yaser","sai","blow","awai","competit","peopl","take","wrong","wai","muslim","know","stuff","like","thi","usual","happen","thei","mani","peopl","think","bad","thing","muslim","afghanistan","iraq","right","thing","like","peopl","see","poorli","treat","watch","thi","show","mai","make","think","act","glad","show","like","thi","come","air","mani","show","piotr","muslim","peopl","terroristsmani","peopl","find","funni","opioion","okai","becaus","preti","much","everyth","make","fun","sai","make","fun","unfair","often","realli","give","muslin","peopl","bad","name"],"filtered2":["honest","time","hear","show","though","mai","bad","idea","make","show","make","muslim","us","racial","joke","themselv","exact","opposit","realiz","show","help","peopl","understand","muslim","us","word","like","real","life","doe","mean","terrorist","thing","conjur","show","peopl","give","muslim","bad","name","becaus","plai","stereotyp","watch","show","regular","peopl","realiz","though","mai","bad","muslim","doe","mean","bad","try","live","dai","time","like","hard","amair","get","plane","us","word","like","blow","yaser","blow","awai","competit","peopl","take","wrong","wai","muslim","know","stuff","like","usual","happen","mani","peopl","think","bad","thing","muslim","afghanistan","iraq","right","thing","like","peopl","see","poorli","treat","watch","show","mai","make","think","act","glad","show","like","come","air","mani","show","piotr","muslim","peopl","terroristsmani","peopl","find","funni","opioion","okai","becaus","preti","everyth","make","fun","make","fun","unfair","often","realli","give","muslin","peopl","bad","name"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,8,9,12,13,18,21,22,23,25,26,28,29,30,31,33,34,36,38,39,40,46,50,56,62,75,80,86,88,94,116,121,123,132,143,155,171,185,191,193,212,214,216,258,259,265,361,398,400,405,436,604,679,754,849,1088,1102,1227,1652,1721,1759,1812,2612,2668,3061,3543,3957,4918],"values":[5.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,8,9,12,13,18,21,22,23,25,26,28,29,30,31,33,34,36,38,39,40,46,50,56,62,75,80,86,88,94,116,121,123,132,143,155,171,185,191,193,212,214,216,258,259,265,361,398,400,405,436,604,679,754,849,1088,1102,1227,1652,1721,1759,1812,2612,2668,3061,3543,3957,4918],"values":[3.0998

{"value":"Film starts in 1840 Japan in which a man slashes his wife and her lover to death and the commits suicide. It's a very gory, bloody sequence. Then it jumps to present day...well 1982 to be precise. Ted (Edward Albert), wife Laura (Susan George) and their annoying little kid move to Japan for hubby's work. They rent a house and--surprise! surprise--it just happens to be the house where the murders took place! The three dead people are around as ghosts (the makeup is hysterically bad) and make life hell for the family.<br /><br />Sounds OK--but it's really hopeless. There's a bloody opening and ending and NOTHING happens in between. There is an attack by giant crabs which is just uproarious! They look so fake--I swear I saw the strings pulling one along--and they're muttering!!!!! There's a pointless sex sequence in the first 20 minutes (probably just to show off George's body), another one about 40 minutes later (but that was necessary to the plot) and a really silly exorcism towards the end. The fight scene between Albert and Doug McClure must be seen to be believed.<br /><br />As for acting--Albert was OK as the husband and McClure was pretty good as a family friend. But George--as always--is terrific in a lousy film. She gives this film a much needed lift--but can't save it. I'm giving this a 2 just for her and the gory opening and closing.

{"value":"What an unusual movie.<br /><br />Absolutely no concessions are made to \"Hollywood special effects\" or entertainment. There is no background music, not special effects or enhanced sound.<br /><br />Facial expressions are usually covered by thick beards and the Spanish language is a strange monotonic lilt that sounds the same whether in the midst of a battle or talking around a campfire.<br /><br />I sort of viewed these movies (parts 1 and 2) as an educational experience, not really something to go and get entertained by. Its quite long and in places dull.<br /><br />But I suspect that given the lack of any plot development, I don't think its very educational either.<br /><br />Its also difficult to perceive any story from the movie dialogue - it would be a good idea to read up a little on the history so that you can understand the context of what is happening, since for some reason the director didn't see fit to inform the audience why Che's band was moving around the way they did - as a result there seem to be groups skulking around the woodland for no particular reason and getting shot at.<br /><br />I would have loved to give this movie more stars for somehow generating more empathy with me and developing depth of character, but somehow all of the characters were still strangers to me at the end. The stars it gets are for realism and showing the hardships of guerrilla warfare.","finished_norm":["what","a","unusu","moviebr","br","absolut","no","concess","be","make","to","hollywood","special","effect","or","entertain","there","be","no","background","music","not","special","effect","or","enhanc","soundbr","br","facial","express","be","usual","cover","by","thick","beard","and","the","spanish","languag","be","a","strang","monoton","lilt","that","sound","the","same","whether","in","the","midst","of","a","battl","or","talk","around","a","campfirebr","br","i","sort","of","view","thi","movi","part","and","a","a","educ","experi","not","realli","someth","to","go","and","get","entertain","by","it","quit","long","and","in","place","dullbr","br","but","i","suspect","that","give","the","lack","of","ani","plot","develop","i","do","not","think","it","veri","educ","eitherbr","br","it","conjur","difficult","to","perceiv","ani","stori","from","the","movi","dialogu","it","would","be","a","good","idea","to","read","up","a","littl","on","the","histori","so","that","you","can","understand","the","context","of","what","be","happen","sinc","for","some","reason","the","director","do","not","see","fit","to","inform","the","audienc","why","che","band","be","move","around","the","wai","thei","do","a","a","result","there","seem","to","be","group","skulk","around","the","woodland","for","no","particular","reason","and","get","shoot","atbr","br","i","would","have","love","to","give","thi","movi","much","star","for","somehow","gener","much","empathi","with","me","and","develop","depth","of","charact","but","somehow","all","of","the","charact","be","still","stranger","to","me","at","the","end","the","star","it","get","be","for","realism","and","show","the","hardship","of","guerrilla","warfar"],"filtered":["unusu","moviebr","br","absolut","concess","make","hollywood","special","effect","entertain","background","music","special","effect","enhanc","soundbr","br","facial","express","usual","cover","thick","beard","spanish","languag","strang","monoton","lilt","sound","whether","midst","battl","talk","around","campfirebr","br","sort","view","thi","movi","part","educ","experi","realli","someth","go","get","entertain","quit","long","place","dullbr","br","suspect","give","lack","ani","plot","develop","think","veri","educ","eitherbr","br","conjur","difficult","perceiv","ani","stori","movi","dialogu","good","idea","read","littl","histori","understand","context","happen","sinc","reason","director","see","fit","inform","audienc","che","band","move","around","wai","thei","result","seem","group","skulk","around","woodland","particular","reason","get","shoot","atbr","br","love","give","thi","movi","much","star","somehow","gener","much","empathi","develop","depth","charact","somehow","charact","still","stranger","end","star","get","realism","show","hardship","guerrilla","warfar"],"filtered2":["unusu","moviebr","absolut","concess","make","hollywood","special","effect","entertain","background","music","special","effect","enhanc","soundbr","facial","express","usual","cover","thick","beard","spanish","languag","strang","monoton","lilt","sound","whether","midst","battl","talk","around","campfirebr","sort","view","part","educ","experi","realli","someth","go","get","entertain","quit","long","place","dullbr","suspect","give","lack","ani","plot","develop","think","veri","educ","eitherbr","conjur","difficult","perceiv","ani","stori","dialogu","good","idea","read","littl","histori","understand","context","happen","sinc","reason","director","see","fit","inform","audienc","che","band","move","around","wai","result","seem","group","skulk","around","woodland","particular","reason","get","shoot","atbr","love","give","star","somehow","gener","empathi","develop","depth","charact","somehow","charact","still","stranger","end","star","get","realism","show","hardship","guerrilla","warfar"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,10,12,13,14,15,17,24,27,28,30,32,33,35,39,53,54,58,61,64,94,95,98,99,100,106,117,118,120,123,145,162,164,168,178,183,186,195,203,212,222,225,248,265,269,275,300,312,320,333,410,417,447,465,491,499,549,597,676,786,801,803,832,846,914,927,977,1043,1094,1470,1668,1719,2055,2060,2228,2627,2654,3059,3090,3162,3345,3576,3866,4400,6349,6472,7546,7854,8440],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,10,12,13,14,15,17,24,27,28,30,32,33,35,39,53,54,58,61,64,94,95,98,99,100,106,117,118,120,123,145,162,164,168,178,183,186,195,203,212,222,225,248,265,269,275,300,312,320,333,410,417,447,465,491,499,549,597,676,786,801,803,832,846,914,927,977,1043,1094,1470,1668,1719,2055,2060,2228,2627,2654,3059,3090,3162,3345,3576,3866,4400,634

{"value":"This movie deserved a working over on Mystery Science Theater. Even though it has nothing whatever to do with King Solomon it's worth a watch because it is an unintentional laugh-riot. Really! It's worse than \"Destroy All Monsters.\" Be sure to check out the following: the cheesy medallion (looks like the Shriners have been here), the obviously polyester Norfolk jacket on \"Allan Quatermain,\" David MaCallum's badly done stutter (which does draw attention away from his even worse acting), the incredibly bad process work on all the \"monsters,\" the monsters themselves - the hand puppet which menaces the little girl, the giant snake that menaces Macallum while he sinks in oatmeal, the red-lighted eyes on the motorized crabs, the amazingly hilarious boat (oh, brother!!) which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a Jr.Sr. prom (\"Voyage into the Future with the class of '71\"), the Phoenician city - where they wear Roman Imperial armor but which inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions -(the Phoenicians invented the alphabet-come on!),and worst of all, Macallum and Ekland (with her fright wig) playing smoochy-face -oh the horror! The best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic Frenchman ,and the African guy -Snuffleupagus or whatever - evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","deserv","a","work","over","on","mysteri","scienc","theater","even","though","it","have","noth","whatev","to","do","with","king","solomon","it","worth","a","watch","becaus","it","be","a","unintent","laughriot","realli","it","wrong","than","destroi","all","monster","be","sure","to","check","out","the","follow","the","cheesi","medallion","look","like","the","shriner","have","be","here","the","obvious","polyest","norfolk","jacket","on","allan","quatermain","david","macallum","badli","do","stutter","which","doe","draw","attent","awai","from","hi","even","wrong","act","the","incredibli","bad","process","work","on","all","the","monster","the","monster","themselv","the","hand","puppet","which","menac","the","littl","girl","the","giant","snake","that","menac","macallum","while","he","sink","in","oatmeal","the","redlight","ey","on","the","motor","crab","the","amazingli","hilari","boat","oh","brother","which","appear","to","be","make","of","plywood","mount","on","a","old","sand","dredg","and","look","like","a","leftov","from","a","jrsr","prom","voyag","into","the","futur","with","the","class","of","the","phoenician","citi","where","thei","wear","roman","imperi","armor","but","which","inexplic","have","egyptian","hieroglyph","inscript","the","phoenician","invent","the","alphabetcom","onand","wrong","of","all","macallum","and","ekland","with","her","fright","wig","plai","smoochyfac","oh","the","horror","the","well","part","be","that","the","intrepid","explor","manag","to","lose","the","comic","frenchman","and","the","african","gui","snuffleupagu","or","whatev","evid","choos","to","die","heroic","rather","than","be","in","ani","much","scene"],"filtered":["thi","movi","deserv","work","mysteri","scienc","theater","even","though","noth","whatev","king","solomon","worth","watch","becaus","unintent","laughriot","realli","wrong","destroi","monster","sure","check","follow","cheesi","medallion","look","like","shriner","obvious","polyest","norfolk","jacket","allan","quatermain","david","macallum","badli","stutter","doe","draw","attent","awai","hi","even","wrong","act","incredibli","bad","process","work","monster","monster","themselv","hand","puppet","menac","littl","girl","giant","snake","menac","macallum","sink","oatmeal","redlight","ey","motor","crab","amazingli","hilari","boat","oh","brother","appear","make","plywood","mount","old","sand","dredg","look","like","leftov","jrsr","prom","voyag","futur","class","phoenician","citi","thei","wear","roman","imperi","armor","inexplic","egyptian","hieroglyph","inscript","phoenician","invent","alphabetcom","onand","wrong","macallum","ekland","fright","wig","plai","smoochyfac","oh","horror","well","part","intrepid","explor","manag","lose","comic","frenchman","african","gui","snuffleupagu","whatev","evid","choos","die","heroic","rather","ani","much","scene"],"filtered2":["deserv","work","mysteri","scienc","theater","even","though","noth","whatev","king","solomon","worth","watch","becaus","unintent","laughriot","realli","wrong","destroi","monster","sure","check","follow","cheesi","medallion","look","like","shriner","obvious","polyest","norfolk","jacket","allan","quatermain","david","macallum","badli","stutter","doe","draw","attent","awai","even","wrong","act","incredibli","bad","process","work","monster","monster","themselv","hand","puppet","menac","littl","girl","giant","snake","menac","macallum","sink","oatmeal","redlight","ey","motor","crab","amazingli","hilari","boat","oh","brother","appear","make","plywood","mount","old","sand","dredg","look","like","leftov","jrsr","prom","voyag","futur","class","phoenician","citi","wear","roman","imperi","armor","inexplic","egyptian","hieroglyph","inscript","phoenician","invent","alphabetcom","onand","wrong","macallum","ekland","fright","wig","plai","smoochyfac","oh","horror","well","part","intrepid","explor","manag","lose","comic","frenchman","african","gui","snuffleupagu","whatev","evid","choos","die","heroic","rather","ani","scene"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,9,13,14,16,18,19,20,21,22,25,27,40,48,49,55,61,67,83,84,86,119,155,160,170,219,221,234,235,260,281,293,341,345,381,403,413,423,424,436,448,480,505,514,541,543,557,576,584,595,628,632,636,675,687,738,844,907,910,1015,1291,1359,1449,1492,1636,1646,1820,1868,1893,2125,2243,2269,2277,3036,3350,3443,3605,3674,4101,4603,4797,4957,5627,6244,6410,6465,6974,7945],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,9,13,14,16,18,19,20,21,22,25,27,40,48,49,55,61,67,83,84,86,119,155,160,170,219,221,234,235,260,281,293,341,345,381,403,413,423,424,436,448,480,505,514,541,5

{"value":"I have yet to read Shirley Jackson's novel, something of which I've been meaning to do for quite sometime. I am sure it has got to be scarier than this film. I remember jumping once when I watched it the other day, although I cannot recall the scene. <br /><br />The special effects are great and I watched this on DVD, but I am sure in the theatre it must have been an awesome sight. After the first few special effects are done with I was waiting for a story to develop.<br /><br />I figured this movie at the least has to be loosely based on the classic novel, so a good story should be there, but it wasn't. I was relegated to staring at the gorgeous Catherine Zeta-Jones character throughout the movie basically because there was nothing much else to watch. Lili Talor was such a suck character. I did not like her one bit, something about whiny people. Also, the guy in this film reminded me of the cartoonish Dudley DoRight with his voice and face. I could not relate to the characters at all. Quigon, ahem Liam Neeson did an admirable job trying to get through this movie with some type of acting.<br /><br />Half to three quarters of the way I was just dying to go see a campy Friday the 13th or a Scream Queenish film!

{"value":"When the young Kevin gets the boat of his dead uncle as a gift, he invites five friends of him to a trip to Catalina Island for the weekend. While in the journey, they drink booze, have sex and play games, with each one of them telling his or her greatest fear. Later Kevin drowns in the open sea, the engine stops, and they are haunted and murdered by their greatest innermost fear.<br /><br />Yesterday, my wife, son, daughter and three other friends joined to watch \"Haunted Boat\" on DVD. With less than 30 minutes running time, the group gave up watching this messy and boring amateurish piece of crap, and we decided to see another film. Later, I decided to watch the rest of this flick to see how bad it could be and it would have been better off going to bed to sleep. The confused story has an awful cinematography and camera work, with a cast that is probably studying to be actors and actresses and in the end this film seems to be a bad project of cinema school. The terrible and pretentious screenplay shows a ridiculous twist in the end, actually a complete mess that made me not understand what the story is all about. Was the girl insane and traveled alone in the boat, imagining the whole situation with imaginary friends? If that is true, are their friend again in the very end fruit of her madness?

{"value":"I was skimming over the list of films of Richard Burton when I came to this title that I recall vividly from when I first saw it on cable in 1982. I remember dialogue from Tatum O'Neal that was just amazingly bad. I remember Richard Burton's character looking so hopelessly lost, and then remembering how his motivations didn't translate to me. In short, I remember \"Circle of Two\" because it was so phenomenally awful.<br /><br />This movie came out at a time when America was going through a rather disturbing period of fascination with unhealthy or skewed angles on teenage sexuality. Recall \"The Blue Lagoon\" (and other Brooke Shields annoyances), \"Lipstick\", \"Little Darlings\", \"Beau Pere\" and other films that just seemed to dwell on teens having sex, particularly with adults. As a teenager during this time, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70's and 80's, made for a subconsciously unsettling environment in which to figure it all out, so to speak.<br /><br />\"Circle of Two\" is not execrably acted or needlessly prurient, like \"Blue Lagoon\". In fact, it tackles the question of love between the young and the old in a brave, if totally failed, way. But honestly, it is one of those films you will *never* see if you didn't see it on its first run because it was so truly awful.

{"value":"Anyone familiar with my reviews on the Internet Movie Database will know that I can be a grumpy bastard from time to time. There are a lot of films I don't like which, for some unfathomable reason, I've felt the urge to review. However, if anyone out there is curious to know the name of the worst film I've ever seen, look no further than Transylvania 6-5000. Without question, this takes the title of the all-time no. 1 awful film. I can't believe that I actually made it from the start of this clunker to the finish!<br /><br />It is clearly meant to capture the flavour of Mel Brooks's Young Frankenstein, but where that film was a funny take on horror movie traditions, this one is a desperately strained and misguided attempt to wring laughs from embarrassingly weak material. Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr look ashamed to be here as a pair of journalists in modern day Transylvania (perhaps they realised early on that they were doomed in this dud). During their research, they come up against all the chief monsters from past horror favourites, such as vampires, werewolves and mummies.<br /><br />Anyone who manages to brave this film right through to its end may pray that a stake be driven through their heart to relieve them from the agony of boredom. It marks a career nadir for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way, it results in awesomely dire

{"value":"For starters, I would like to say that I'm a fan of the American Pie series. Even though 'the naked mile' and this one are the two worst, this one seems to be the downfall of the whole series.<br /><br />First of all, the best part of the film was that it was an American Pie film, which is always appreciated.<br /><br />However, there are tonnes of bad things to say about this film. First of all, the story has a very stale 'arc' structure. First, there is the introduction of the characters, then the pledging of the beta house and finally the Greek Olympiad. Each of which has exactly 25 minutes of length. Apart from the general staleness of the plot, there is little to no character development, which makes a double whammy of a bad plot.<br /><br />Apart from that, I deeply disliked the stereotyping in this film. That is, showing the jocks as the extremely cool, only-thinking-about-sex guys, and explicitly displaying the geeks as inferior. Also, it shows females only as sexual objects, and males as only wanting to treat the females as sexual objects.<br /><br />Apart from that, the acting was also poor. With perhaps the exception of Steve Talley.<br /><br />So, in the end, a generally horrid film, if seen from a critical point of view. If seen from a teen point of view, I guess that it's better, but this film is rated 18+ in most countries, so it shouldn't really be seen by minors.","finished_norm":["for","starter","i","would","like","to","sai","that","i","be","a","fan","of","the","american","pie","seri","even","though","the","nake","mile","and","thi","on","be","the","two","wrong","thi","on","seem","to","be","the","downfal","of","the","whole","seriesbr","br","of","all","the","well","part","of","the","film","be","that","it","be","a","american","pie","film","which","be","alwai","appreciatedbr","br","howev","there","be","tonn","of","bad","thing","to","sai","about","thi","film","of","all","the","stori","have","a","veri","stale","arc","structur","there","be","the","introduct","of","the","charact","then","the","pledg","of","the","beta","hous","and","final","the","greek","olympiad","each","of","which","have","exactli","minut","of","length","apart","from","the","gener","stale","of","the","plot","there","be","littl","to","no","charact","develop","which","make","a","doubl","whammi","of","a","bad","plotbr","br","apart","from","that","i","deepli","dislik","the","stereotyp","in","thi","film","that","be","show","the","jock","a","the","extrem","cool","onlythinkingaboutsex","gui","and","explicitli","displai","the","geek","a","inferior","conjur","it","show","femal","onli","a","sexual","object","and","male","a","onli","want","to","treat","the","femal","a","sexual","objectsbr","br","apart","from","that","the","act","be","conjur","poor","with","perhap","the","except","of","steve","talleybr","br","so","in","the","end","a","gener","horrid","film","if","see","from","a","critic","point","of","view","if","see","from","a","teen","point","of","view","i","guess","that","it","well","but","thi","film","be","rate","+","in","much","countri","so","it","should","not","realli","be","see","by","minor"],"filtered":["starter","like","sai","fan","american","pie","seri","even","though","nake","mile","thi","two","wrong","thi","seem","downfal","whole","seriesbr","br","well","part","film","american","pie","film","alwai","appreciatedbr","br","howev","tonn","bad","thing","sai","thi","film","stori","veri","stale","arc","structur","introduct","charact","pledg","beta","hous","final","greek","olympiad","exactli","minut","length","apart","gener","stale","plot","littl","charact","develop","make","doubl","whammi","bad","plotbr","br","apart","deepli","dislik","stereotyp","thi","film","show","jock","extrem","cool","onlythinkingaboutsex","gui","explicitli","displai","geek","inferior","conjur","show","femal","onli","sexual","object","male","onli","want","treat","femal","sexual","objectsbr","br","apart","act","conjur","poor","perhap","except","steve","talleybr","br","end","gener","horrid","film","see","critic","point","view","see","teen","point","view","guess","well","thi","film","rate","+","much","countri","realli","see","minor"],"filtered2":["starter","like","fan","american","pie","even","though","nake","mile","two","wrong","seem","downfal","whole","seriesbr","well","part","american","pie","alwai","appreciatedbr","howev","tonn","bad","thing","stori","veri","stale","arc","structur","introduct","charact","pledg","beta","hous","final","greek","olympiad","exactli","minut","length","apart","gener","stale","plot","littl","charact","develop","make","doubl","whammi","bad","plotbr","apart","deepli","dislik","stereotyp","show","jock","extrem","cool","onlythinkingaboutsex","gui","explicitli","displai","geek","inferior","conjur","show","femal","onli","sexual","object","male","onli","want","treat","femal","sexual","objectsbr","apart","act","conjur","poor","perhap","except","steve","talleybr","end","gener","horrid","see","critic","point","view","see","teen","point","view","guess","well","rate","+","countri","realli","see","minor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,9,10,11,13,14,15,17,20,21,24,25,28,29,32,35,37,39,47,55,59,61,66,86,111,113,140,146,156,197,202,213,223,225,232,243,312,318,320,329,422,462,481,519,572,579,604,608,649,849,881,893,1063,1097,1104,1206,1261,1307,1515,1614,1622,1651,1898,2106,2258,2288,2877,2931,3127,3405,3736,3753,3983,4074,4486,5836,5963],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,9,10,11,13,14,15,17,20,21,24,25,28,29,32,35,37,39,47,55,59,61,66,86,111,113,140,146,156,197,202,213,223,225,232,243,312,318,320,329,422,462,481,519,572,579,604,608,649,849,881,893,1063,1097,1104,1206,1261,1307,1515,1614,1622,1651,1898,2106,2258,2288,2877,2931,3127,3405,3736,3753,3983,4074,4486,5836,5963],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.926017105726131,2.1367141713444147,2.247774048205673,1.982619630677639,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016

{"value":"The story concerns a genealogy researcher (Mel Harris) who is hired by her Estee Lauder-like cosmetic queen aunt. Her aunt (by marriage we are left to presume) is trying to track down her long lost family in Europe. All they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing by an ornate music box. The researcher heads to Europe and conducts her search in places like Milan, Budapest, and Vienna. The scenery is the real thing and is actually shot on location (unlike a Murder, She Wrote where Jessica is supposed to be visiting a far-flung locale and Lansbury never left Burbank). Anyway, she meets a young man who is also searching to solve a family mystery of his own and they team up to track down clues and menace bad guys. The dialogue, particularly the romantic dialogue, is terrible. I watched this because of the scenery but the script was so bad that I stayed on just to see if it would get worse. It did. Acting was also off. I can see why Mel Harris's career never really took off after thirtysomething, but she is adequate (seems too old for her co-star though). But, the supporting players are straight out of the community playhouse. I also lost count of how many times they say \"Budapest\" to each other. Yes, it is pronounced Bood-a-phesht. We know, okay? I realized halfway into the film that this had to be one of those Harlequin movies and sure enough it is.

{"value":"This movie is about a very sexy Olympic track star who is hired to coach a high school boys' basketball team. Similar to Goldie Hawn's WILDCATS, it stars Cathy Lee Crosby in the title role, and she does as about as well as the script allows. I think Racquel Welch would have been a better choice, but considering the film's apparent TV movie budget, they probably couldn't afford her. Cathy Lee does look great in every shot, but we never get to see her completely nude. The story is pretty predictable, to say the least, offering no surprises. A young and lucky Michael Biehn has the male lead role. He is the star on the team and also the love interest for Cathy Lee. Keenan Wynn has a few amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and doesn't think a woman should coach sports. This point is brought up throughout the film, and, needless to say, is dated. Ironically, Cathy Lee doesn't put her team through any unorthodox practice sessions; she doesn't do anything a male coach wouldn't do. There is a funny subplot involving a tall and not-so-bright player who undergoes hypnosis in order to pass his classes and play like pro basketball player Sydney Wicks. It looks like everyone had a good time making this film, but the only real reason to see it is for Cathy Lee Crosby.

{"value":"This movie was so poorly written and directed I fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie. The jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles, it is too far fetched and at some points- ridiculous. If you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed, but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts (which I might add are poorly done) and wish you were some warrior to. The casting in this movie wasn't very good, and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn't fit at all. On a scale of 1-10 (10 being excellent, 1 being horrible) the acting in this movie is a 4. Brenda Song is talented in comedy, but with this kind of movie, in some of the more serious scenes, her acting was laughable. When she made some of her \"fighting\" poses, I started laughing out loud. I think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing, for example, the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing, how her voice turns dark and evil, I think that was incredibly stupid, and how Wendy's (Brenda Song)teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks, that was pretty ridiculous to. So to sumamrize it all, a disappointing movie, but okay if you're 10 or under.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","so","poorli","write","and","direct","i","fall","asleep","minut","through","the","movi","the","joke","in","the","movi","be","corni","and","even","though","the","plot","be","interest","at","some","angl","it","be","too","far","fetch","and","at","some","point","ridicul","if","you","be","or","old","you","will","overlook","the","write","in","the","movi","and","be","disappoint","but","if","you","be","or","young","thi","be","a","film","that","will","captur","your","attent","and","be","amaz","with","all","the","stunt","which","i","mai","add","be","poorli","do","and","wish","you","be","some","warrior","to","the","cast","in","thi","movi","be","not","veri","good","and","the","music","be","veri","disappoint","becaus","it","be","like","thei","be","try","to","build","up","the","tension","but","it","do","not","fit","at","all","on","a","scale","of","be","excel","be","horribl","the","act","in","thi","movi","be","a","brenda","song","be","talent","in","comedi","but","with","thi","kind","of","movi","in","some","of","the","much","seriou","scene","her","act","be","laughabl","when","she","make","some","of","her","fight","pose","i","start","laugh","out","loud","i","think","the","wrong","thing","about","thi","movi","be","definit","the","direct","for","exampl","the","part","where","her","enemi","turn","out","to","be","the","person","the","evil","villain","be","posses","how","her","voic","turn","dark","and","evil","i","think","that","be","incredibli","stupid","and","how","wendi","brenda","songteach","be","all","her","teacher","at","school","be","possess","by","monk","that","be","pretti","ridicul","to","so","to","sumamr","it","all","a","disappoint","movi","but","okai","if","you","re","or","under"],"filtered":["thi","movi","poorli","write","direct","fall","asleep","minut","movi","joke","movi","corni","even","though","plot","interest","angl","far","fetch","point","ridicul","old","overlook","write","movi","disappoint","young","thi","film","captur","attent","amaz","stunt","mai","add","poorli","wish","warrior","cast","thi","movi","veri","good","music","veri","disappoint","becaus","like","thei","try","build","tension","fit","scale","excel","horribl","act","thi","movi","brenda","song","talent","comedi","thi","kind","movi","much","seriou","scene","act","laughabl","make","fight","pose","start","laugh","loud","think","wrong","thing","thi","movi","definit","direct","exampl","part","enemi","turn","person","evil","villain","posses","voic","turn","dark","evil","think","incredibli","stupid","wendi","brenda","songteach","teacher","school","possess","monk","pretti","ridicul","sumamr","disappoint","movi","okai","re"],"filtered2":["poorli","write","direct","fall","asleep","minut","joke","corni","even","though","plot","interest","angl","far","fetch","point","ridicul","old","overlook","write","disappoint","young","captur","attent","amaz","stunt","mai","add","poorli","wish","warrior","cast","veri","good","music","veri","disappoint","becaus","like","try","build","tension","fit","scale","excel","horribl","act","brenda","song","talent","comedi","kind","seriou","scene","act","laughabl","make","fight","pose","start","laugh","loud","think","wrong","thing","definit","direct","exampl","part","enemi","turn","person","evil","villain","posses","voic","turn","dark","evil","think","incredibli","stupid","wendi","brenda","songteach","teacher","school","possess","monk","pretti","ridicul","sumamr","disappoint","okai","re"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,12,15,19,21,22,25,29,32,36,46,59,60,61,65,66,67,68,71,78,86,92,96,101,102,118,122,127,133,135,136,153,169,187,191,214,230,233,274,276,296,299,307,321,328,368,392,398,399,428,477,493,520,552,580,636,676,685,687,887,925,957,1114,1293,1305,1346,1485,1544,1564,1775,1928,1939,2437,2900,2948,3982,4005],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,12,15,19,21,22,25,29,32,36,46,59,60,61,65,66,67,68,71,78,86,92,96,101,102,118,122,127,133,135,136,153,169,187,191,214,230,233,274,276,296,299,307,321,328,368,392,398,399,428,477,493,520,552,580,636,676,685,687,887,925,957,1114,1293,1305,1346,1485,1544,1564,1775,1928,1939,2437,2900,2948,3982,4005],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,2.133457220525776,2.4001215597131385,1.312380678011735,2.324031090670098,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.655771293751733,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,3.8147700134888347,1.929723173391612,1.9570915389266579,2.0064197866819473,1.9214926742550966,2.0064197866819473,2.031112399272319,2.0489535369135887,4.078141625743051,2.09858

{"value":"Since this picture is classified a \"pure entertainment\" work and since there are already many comments on it, I'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour. We can see that Marlon Wayans is playing the joker role in this film. Certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job, he has always been acting as a little man-an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance-and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary. However far away from what I expected, I saw an image very disguising, pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty-year- old criminal. And with a ridiculous happy ending. So what is the point? Many elements are mixed up, some principal ones are violence, sex and criminal activities, amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent, lack common sense: where is Vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband's life being pursued? In addition the diamond is even bigger than the world's No.1 Cullinan! But the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points. And they call it humour. A diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat.

{"value":"Banned as a 'Video Nasty' in the UK, Unhinged has naturally gained quite a bit of notoriety. However, the most shocking thing I found about the film was its amateurishness in all departments. The bloodletting I could handle: the terrible acting, shoddy editing, awful direction, lousy script and abysmal soundtrack were much harder to take.<br /><br />Three girls on their way to a music festival crash into a ravine during a storm. They are rescued by a friendly stranger who takes them to a nearby house. The owner of the house, a batty old lady, and her spinster daughter, welcome the girls in, allowing them to stay for a few days in order to recuperate. However, someone doesn't want the girls to leaveever! One by one they fall victim to an unseen assailant.<br /><br />Taking a long time to get going and featuring some of the worst performances ever in a horror film (and that takes some doing), Unhinged is a truly awful film. The music is a total mess (it sounds like a three year old has been let loose on a synthesiser) and as such, it complements the movie perfectly. Only a couple of bloody scenes towards the end and a bit of gratuitous nudity save Unhinged from getting the lowest possible score.<br /><br />If you are a horror completist (and unfortunately, I am), you will want to see this in order to tick it off the Video Nasty watch-list. But be warnedit is really, really

{"value":"First of all I thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired. However, it wasn't the Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story \"The Bottle Imp\". A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell. That's fine. Nobody said screenwriters had to be original. The actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the ending. The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film, they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film. This is a stupid convention. The older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end. There is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think. You can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end.

{"value":"It really is that bad of a movie. My buddy rented it because he, well, is an idiot. But then again, I must be an idiot too because I watched the whole damn thing! The actors were on par with high school drama geeks who think that are going places. The only place they will be going is back to waiting tables at Luby's. All I could think of while I was watching this \"gem\" was how it actually got made. I mean, some \"screenwriter\" actually thought that this premise was fresh, original and lucrative. Then some moron with money believed in the script so much that he decided to fork some cash over with the naive misconception that he was going to make a return on it. Actors were cast, locations were scouted, make-up artists were hired, computer animators fresh out of Al Collins graphic Design School were brought in and this turd started to take form.<br /><br />There obviously were a ton of things that I hated about this move but the one thing the drove me the craziest was the overuse of music. Every single minute of this flick was scored. There was not a single break in music. And at times it was mixed higher than the dialogue, not that it made you miss some vital plot point or anything.<br /><br />After it was over, we decided to watch Mystic River. It was like driving a 1980 VW Diesel Rabbit then switching to a BMW 740il.

{"value":"When this movie was released, it spawned one of the all-time great capsule movie reviews: Sphinx Stinks. It does, but in a mesmerizing sort of way. The casting is silly, starting at the top: Frank Langella and Sir John Gielgud as Egyptians? Not enough makeup in Cairo for that, at least not while this film was being made. But it's rather amusing to see them try. The performances run the gamut from mummy-like (sorry, the obvious observation) to over-the-top, with very few stops in between. The Lesley-Anne Down character seems as though she couldn't find Egypt on a map, much less expound upon its archaeological treasures. That's due at least in part to some really bad writing, one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie. It's my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric, such as Egyptology, are ripe for silly, overwritten dialogue. It doesn't disappoint, and the convergence proves a double-whammy. The plot has one driving source of dramatic tension: Can this get dumber and less believable? The answer is, usually, YES. The location shots are beautiful, and the set design is generally very good, the only consistent reminders that this wasn't some low-budget production.

{"value":"There is a level of high expectation when you sit down to watch a comedy with a cast headed by Cary Grant, Jayne Mansfield, Ray Walston and Werner Klemperer. Those expectations are buoyed further when the film is directed by Stanley Donen, whose comic touch was so evident in, among others, DAMN YANKEES!, BEDAZZLED and CHARADE. For the first five minutes, or so, it seems that those expectations might be met and then. Nothing. What is supposed to be a light comedy, plunges into leaden, heavy handed melodrama, with nary a chuckle to be had.<br /><br />Relative newcomer Suzy Parker has often been criticized for her performance, or lack of one, in this film, but in a movie in which even the great Cary Grant frequently appears flat and wooden, attacking Parker seems unfair. Not even as bright a light as an Audrey Hepburn or Doris Day could have changed the fortunes of this meandering, dreary and wholly pointless script, which drags itself lamely along and drags the viewer's interest and patience down with it.<br /><br />The rest of the cast, especially Ray Walston, keep trying to breath some life into the proceedings, but the horrible script is beyond resuscitation. The desperate, inane effort to drag a half hearted laugh from the numbed audience in the film's final moments only serves to add insult to injury.<br /><br />This film is nothing but a major

{"value":"I always thought people were a little too cynical about these old Andy Hardy films. A couple of them weren't bad. Modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty, so goody-two shoes movies like these rarely get praise<br /><br />Nonetheless, I can't defend this movie either. You can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story. Watching this, you just shake your head ask yourself, \"how stupid can you get?\" This is cornier than corny, if you know what I mean. It is so corny I cannot fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour-and-a-half.<br /><br />The story basically is \"Andy\" (Mickey Rooney) trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some débutante from New York City as if that was the ultimate. People were a lot more social-conscious in the old days. You'd hear the term \"social-climber\" as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life. It's all utter nonsense, of course, and looks even more so today.<br /><br />However, it's about as innocent and clean a story and series (there were a half dozen of these Andy Hardy films made) as you could find. Also, if you like to hear Judy Garland sing, then this is your ticket, as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into Andy's heart.

{"value":"I don't see what everyone liked about this movie. The set-up was too long and talky, and when it was done, the main character remained as flat and opaque as he had been in the first scene. After the film finally got Cusack into the eponymous hotel room, I had to wonder, well, what's going to happen here for the next hour or so to keep me engaged. The answer: not much, just John Cusack having a long, drawn-out, mental breakdown.<br /><br />Maybe if the Cusack character had more depth . . maybe if his freak-out were a more thorough reworking of his everyday life . . . maybe if the film had either better developed its half-baked themes about loss and faith or had not tacked them on in the first place . . . maybe if the film had made a choice to be either psychological horror or thrill-ride horror and had fully embraced one of these styles . . . I dunno. All I do know is that I saw this movie with two other horror buffs and none of us much liked it.<br /><br />Except for the disquieting episode on the hotel ledge, the alarming crazy lady with the hammer, and the so-stupid-it-was-fun crypt keeper in the air duct, all three of which account for no more than five minutes of screen time, this film was a bore.<br /><br />By the way, this story seems to steal ideas from The Shining and use them here to much less powerful effect. Is Stephen King now reduced to stealing ideas from himself?","finished_norm":["i","do","not","see","what","everyon","like","about","thi","movi","the","setup","be","too","long","and","talki","and","when","it","be","do","the","main","charact","remain","a","flat","and","opaqu","a","he","have","be","in","the","scene","after","the","film","final","get","cusack","into","the","eponym","hotel","room","i","have","to","wonder","good","what","go","to","happen","here","for","the","next","hour","or","so","to","keep","me","engag","the","answer","not","much","just","john","cusack","have","a","long","drawnout","mental","breakdownbr","br","mayb","if","the","cusack","charact","have","much","depth","mayb","if","hi","freakout","be","a","much","thorough","rework","of","hi","everydai","life","mayb","if","the","film","have","either","well","develop","it","halfbak","theme","about","loss","and","faith","or","have","not","tack","them","on","in","the","place","mayb","if","the","film","have","make","a","choic","to","be","either","psycholog","horror","or","thrillrid","horror","and","have","fulli","embrac","on","of","thi","styl","i","dunno","all","i","do","know","be","that","i","see","thi","movi","with","two","other","horror","buff","and","none","of","u","much","like","itbr","br","except","for","the","disquiet","episod","on","the","hotel","ledg","the","alarm","crazi","ladi","with","the","hammer","and","the","sostupiditwasfun","crypt","keeper","in","the","air","duct","all","three","of","which","account","for","no","much","than","five","minut","of","screen","time","thi","film","be","a","borebr","br","by","the","wai","thi","stori","seem","to","steal","idea","from","the","shine","and","us","them","here","to","much","littl","power","effect","be","stephen","king","now","reduc","to","steal","idea","from","himself"],"filtered":["see","everyon","like","thi","movi","setup","long","talki","main","charact","remain","flat","opaqu","scene","film","final","get","cusack","eponym","hotel","room","wonder","good","go","happen","next","hour","keep","engag","answer","much","john","cusack","long","drawnout","mental","breakdownbr","br","mayb","cusack","charact","much","depth","mayb","hi","freakout","much","thorough","rework","hi","everydai","life","mayb","film","either","well","develop","halfbak","theme","loss","faith","tack","place","mayb","film","make","choic","either","psycholog","horror","thrillrid","horror","fulli","embrac","thi","styl","dunno","know","see","thi","movi","two","horror","buff","none","u","much","like","itbr","br","except","disquiet","episod","hotel","ledg","alarm","crazi","ladi","hammer","sostupiditwasfun","crypt","keeper","air","duct","three","account","much","five","minut","screen","time","thi","film","borebr","br","wai","thi","stori","seem","steal","idea","shine","us","much","littl","power","effect","stephen","king","reduc","steal","idea"],"filtered2":["see","everyon","like","setup","long","talki","main","charact","remain","flat","opaqu","scene","final","get","cusack","eponym","hotel","room","wonder","good","go","happen","next","hour","keep","engag","answer","john","cusack","long","drawnout","mental","breakdownbr","mayb","cusack","charact","depth","mayb","freakout","thorough","rework","everydai","life","mayb","either","well","develop","halfbak","theme","loss","faith","tack","place","mayb","make","choic","either","psycholog","horror","thrillrid","horror","fulli","embrac","styl","dunno","know","see","two","horror","buff","none","u","like","itbr","except","disquiet","hotel","ledg","alarm","crazi","ladi","hammer","sostupiditwasfun","crypt","keeper","air","duct","three","account","five","minut","screen","time","borebr","wai","stori","seem","steal","idea","shine","us","littl","power","effect","stephen","king","reduc","steal","idea"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,8,10,14,17,19,20,26,33,35,47,56,59,75,83,94,99,106,112,123,134,156,163,164,174,175,179,192,207,224,232,246,291,297,320,365,370,380,430,472,504,513,534,541,578,593,679,682,712,800,809,911,914,943,1072,1277,1347,1367,1503,1599,1709,1851,1985,2013,2290,2326,2779,3120,3784,3835,3914,4226,5084,6027,6713,6733,6780,7579,8206],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,8,10,14,17,19,20,26,33,35,47,56,59,75,83,94,99,106,112,123,134,156,163,164,174,175,179,192,207,224,232,246,291,297,320,365,370,380,430,472,504,513,534,541,578,593,679,682,712,800,809,911,914,943,1072,1277,1347,1367,1503,1599,1709,1851,1985,2013,2290,2326,2779,3120,3784,3835,3914,4226,5084,6027,6713,6733,6780,7579,8206],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,1.1175081997259209

{"value":"Revolt of the Zombies has no redeeming features. I'm tired of people arguing that it's not that bad, and that the effects must have packed more of a punch in 1936. I suspect this isn't true: it's not like IQ's have risen sharply in the last 7 decades. The average viewer in 1936 was probably just as bored by this rubbish as the average viewer today. Why? Just try watching the first scenes, and count the pauses between things happening, the awful choice of when to cut to close-up, the slapdash editing that seems to include an extra two seconds on every shot to pad out the running time. Pay attention to the utterly redundant dialogue: \"I'm going to make some tea/go outside/read my book now.\" \"Are you?\" \"Yes, I am.\" That sort of exchange happens several times. Normally I would love that, being a HUGE fan of bad movies, but watch the listless actors mumbling their trite and tedious lines, and all desire to laugh at the movie slowly fades away. This sort of disinterested, pot-boiling time-waster is far worse than energetic, imaginative mind-blowers like Plan Nine From Outer Space or Santa Claus Conquers The Martians. Those who claim that this is \"better\" than those more interesting movies have a backwards idea of entertainment. This movie is not bad in the sense that your jaw hangs open in astonishment: it's bad in the sense that your eyes slowly close in boredom.

{"value":"Starring an unknown cast which seem likely to remain that way, this \"film\" is yet another cheap slasher flick which amazes me how this was released. I have no problem with horrors and slasher flicks in particular, in fact they are my favourites. But when they are done THIS BAD, it really does take the monkey and its no wonder the genre has such a hard time. The story is as clichéd and without imagination as possible with a bunch of people in a cabin out in the woods being slashed and hacked up by this zombie/ghost guy. Its not the story that sucks the most, its the atrocious acting and dialouge, home made directing quality and an awful soundtrack. Not to mention laughable effects and some incredibly lazy film making - these morons are outside in clear daylight yet we are meant to believe it's night?? What the hell was the director thinking with this move? What, he had only one day to film all this in? He was scared of the dark? ( Is hilarious seeing a cop walking around in pure daylight with a torch acting as if its pitch black, though)<br /><br />I guess the positive side for the actors is they look like people who work in the local supermarket so at least they could possibly escape from this film without ever being noticed. Im sure one of the \"teens\" plays bingo down the local pub - but she's 40-45.<br /><br />Anyway, good for a laugh but just another waste of film and time.","finished_norm":["star","a","unknown","cast","which","seem","like","to","remain","that","wai","thi","film","be","yet","anoth","cheap","slasher","flick","which","amaz","me","how","thi","be","releas","i","have","no","problem","with","horror","and","slasher","flick","in","particular","in","fact","thei","be","my","favourit","but","when","thei","be","do","thi","bad","it","realli","doe","take","the","monkei","and","it","no","wonder","the","genr","have","such","a","hard","time","the","stori","be","a","clichéd","and","without","imagin","a","possibl","with","a","bunch","of","peopl","in","a","cabin","out","in","the","wood","be","slash","and","hack","up","by","thi","zombieghost","gui","it","not","the","stori","that","suck","the","much","it","the","atroci","act","and","dialoug","home","make","direct","qualiti","and","a","aw","soundtrack","not","to","mention","laughabl","effect","and","some","incredibli","lazi","film","make","thi","moron","be","outsid","in","clear","daylight","yet","we","be","mean","to","believ","it","night","what","the","hell","be","the","director","think","with","thi","move","what","he","have","onli","on","dai","to","film","all","thi","in","he","be","scare","of","the","dark","be","hilari","see","a","cop","walk","around","in","pure","daylight","with","a","torch","act","a","if","it","pitch","black","thoughbr","br","i","guess","the","posit","side","for","the","actor","be","thei","look","like","peopl","who","work","in","the","local","supermarket","so","at","littl","thei","can","possibli","escap","from","thi","film","without","ever","be","notic","im","sure","on","of","the","teen","plai","bingo","down","the","local","pub","but","she","br","br","anywai","good","for","a","laugh","but","just","anoth","wast","of","film","and","time"],"filtered":["star","unknown","cast","seem","like","remain","wai","thi","film","yet","anoth","cheap","slasher","flick","amaz","thi","releas","problem","horror","slasher","flick","particular","fact","thei","favourit","thei","thi","bad","realli","doe","take","monkei","wonder","genr","hard","time","stori","clichéd","without","imagin","possibl","bunch","peopl","cabin","wood","slash","hack","thi","zombieghost","gui","stori","suck","much","atroci","act","dialoug","home","make","direct","qualiti","aw","soundtrack","mention","laughabl","effect","incredibli","lazi","film","make","thi","moron","outsid","clear","daylight","yet","mean","believ","night","hell","director","think","thi","move","onli","dai","film","thi","scare","dark","hilari","see","cop","walk","around","pure","daylight","torch","act","pitch","black","thoughbr","br","guess","posit","side","actor","thei","look","like","peopl","work","local","supermarket","littl","thei","possibli","escap","thi","film","without","ever","notic","im","sure","teen","plai","bingo","local","pub","br","br","anywai","good","laugh","anoth","wast","film","time"],"filtered2":["star","unknown","cast","seem","like","remain","wai","yet","anoth","cheap","slasher","flick","amaz","releas","problem","horror","slasher","flick","particular","fact","favourit","bad","realli","doe","take","monkei","wonder","genr","hard","time","stori","clichéd","without","imagin","possibl","bunch","peopl","cabin","wood","slash","hack","zombieghost","gui","stori","suck","atroci","act","dialoug","home","make","direct","qualiti","aw","soundtrack","mention","laughabl","effect","incredibli","lazi","make","moron","outsid","clear","daylight","yet","mean","believ","night","hell","director","think","move","onli","dai","scare","dark","hilari","see","cop","walk","around","pure","daylight","torch","act","pitch","black","thoughbr","guess","posit","side","actor","look","like","peopl","work","local","supermarket","littl","possibli","escap","without","ever","notic","im","sure","teen","plai","bingo","local","pub","anywai","good","laugh","anoth","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,17,18,21,23,31,33,35,40,41,44,48,55,58,73,83,88,89,91,92,97,98,100,102,106,119,125,132,133,138,167,171,175,194,210,229,243,257,275,285,294,302,319,327,340,351,368,386,394,402,419,421,425,467,475,476,509,552,558,590,623,632,638,655,682,685,687,688,726,731,791,796,832,881,1219,1387,1512,1530,1534,1583,1610,1902,2184,2305,2346,2804,3940,4025,4261,5858,5998],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,17,18,21,23,31,33,35,40,41,44,48,55,58,73,83,88,89,91,92,97,98,100,102,106,119,125,132,133,138,167,171,175,194,210,229,243,257,275,285,294,302,319,327,340,351,368,386,394,402,419,421,425,467,475,476,509,552,558,590,623,632,638,655,682,685,687,

{"value":"When I saw the previews for this movie, I didn't expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie. But wow, this movie was absolutely awful. And that's being generous.<br /><br />First of all, the casting for the movie was terrible. You feel no sympathy (or for that matter any morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrible that I was just simply waiting and hoping for the God-awful thing to end.<br /><br />Secondly, there are points in the movie that had absolutely no relation to the plot whatsoever. Can somebody please explain to me why the girlish-looking boy starts screaming \"PANCAKES!!!\" at the top of his lungs while going into Jackie Chan moves I've never seen before, and even further biting the guy who has the virus? Why does the father of the kid proceed to get angry with the virus-infected guy, and go on a redneck hunting spree to find him? I was left with a feeling of such confusion and utter disbelief that I literally said out loud, \"Where the hell did that come from?\"<br /><br />I just simply couldn't believe what I had seen. I really thought I had seen some bad movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all. This movie made me want to puke and then puke again.

{"value":"There are so many goofy things about this movie that I can't possibly name but a few:<br /><br />BOGART's character: 1. His name  Whip McCord (too easy, so I'll leave it at that. Boy, it makes `Humphrey' sound good.) 2. His long, curly hair and silly sideburns. 3. His Black Bart get-up, complete with spurs! 4. Not sure what shade of lipgloss they've got him wearing, but it ain't none too flattering.<br /><br />CAGNEY's character (Jim Kincaid ): 1. His lipstick doesn't do him any favors, either. 2. The man is being swallowed by his hat during the entire film! Could they not find a hat to fit him? Even a LITTLE?!!?! 3. His pants are too tight in the rear. 4. He blows the smoke off his gun one too many times, if you know what I mean, and I think you do.<br /><br />If you are a casual Bogart or Cagney fan, and figure it might be a change of pace to see them in a western, do yourself a favor and forget that thought. EVEN THE HORSES LOOK EMBARRASSED! (That is, when they don't look bored.)<br /><br />In all fairness, I admit that westerns are my least favorite film genre, but I've still seen much, MUCH better than this.<br /><br />On a comedy level, or as high camp, The Oklahoma Kid works. Otherwise, it's viewer beware. Therefore, see this only if a) you must see every western out there b) you are a TRUE Cagney or Bogie completist c) any of the above comments appeal to you.

{"value":"My first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes, roughly after the TV report scene, which I couldn't handle. It went approximately like this:<br /><br />Reporter 1: Hmm, there's a pyramid in our skies. Reporter 2: I think it's aliens. *awkward silence* Reporter 1: In other news...<br /><br />A few days later I watched it to the end, and it wasn't as horrible as I've imagined, but there are serious problems with this. About half of the plot can be easily discarded. And the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or something.<br /><br />What use are the detective, the eugenics people, and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by Horus? More amusing was the monopoly scene. \"We're all powerful \"Gods\", who have lived for aeons, and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly.\" Monopoly? Monopoly?! Even Erich von Dainiken looks coherent, compared to that.<br /><br />The other half is terribly lacking. What did our protagonist do to get himself cryo-frozen? Why was there no big event when he was released at the end? He had those pesky followers, remember? What happened to normal humans? What's the deal with the masked guy?

{"value":"In the many films I have seen Warren Oates, I have come to a definite conclusion, here is one talented individual. I first saw Mr. Oates back in the 1960's television series called Stoney Burke. From then on, I followed his career closely and felt he was destined for great roles. That happened in 1974, when Sam Peckinpah gave him top billing in a film called 'Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.' Of course, his biggest claim to fame was his magnificent role in 'The Wild Bunch'. I have always thought he was quite able to bring any character a certain magic, that is until I saw him in this flop. The movie is called \" Chandler \", a tribute to the iron fisted detectives of the 1950's created by Raymond Chandler. Because, the synopsis said it was about a hard nose Private Eye, I was immediately interested. However, I sat patiently through the entire film and found it to be a dull, dis-interesting, slow pace, twisted, confusing saga which if it had a theme or plot must have been left on some dark back room self. Collectively and with some of Hollywood's best supporting stars, such as Alex Dreier, Mitch Ryan, Gordon Pinsent, Charles McGraw, Richard Loo and Scatman Crothers, this movie had enough power to reach Mach five, however, it fizzled on the launchpad and went no where. As a result, one of my favorite actor's got stuck in a poorly made vehicle which never got off the ground.

{"value":"Horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century. Way before the 'Scary Movie' series there were a few examples of this genre, mostly in the 80s. But like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss. Some like 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark' mostly rise above that, but other like 'Saturday the 14th' and it's sequel fail to deliver the laughs. But out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and that's 'Transylvania 6-5000,' a major waste of time for many reasons.<br /><br />Pros: A great cast that does it's best. Some of the dopey humor is amusing. A corny, but catch theme song. Some good Transylvanian locations.<br /><br />Cons: Threadbare plot. Mostly tedious pacing. Most of the humor just doesn't cut it. The monsters are given little to do and little screen time. I thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies? Lame ending that will likely make viewers angry.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This is a comedy? If it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between? Comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor, not roll our eyes and yawn, aching for it to be over. I can't believe Anchor Bay released this tired junk. I'll admit it's not one of the worst films ever made, but it's not worth anyone's time or money even if you're a fan of any of the actors.

{"value":"Don't get me wrong, I love action and revenge flicks, I've seen many of them since I was a kid, including Dolph Lundgren's latest \"The Mechanik\" which is quite good. And Tony Scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films.<br /><br />But with \"Man on Fire\" (and even more then with \"Domino\"), Scott shows that rather than using his film-making \"genius\" skills intelligently, he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesn't offer him. \"Man of Fire\" is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less.<br /><br />The way Scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it.<br /><br />At times where the MPAA and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings, violence and making PG-13 movies, I find also suspicious that a $70 million movie is made of a B-movie script with a character who cuts fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows a guy's hand with a shotgun, all this to avenge the death of a little girl who ISN'T even dead!

{"value":"America needs the best man possible to win \"The game\" so who do they hire? A gymnast (Oh brother!) played by Kurt Thomas who has the necessary skills to win in a game which involves ninjas, a village of crazies and Richard Norton who is told by Kurt Thomas \"to keep his hardware in his pants.\" (His exact words) I missed this in theaters and it's a good reason because I would have probably been kicked out due to the laughing I broke into at regular intervals. The first thing that went through my mind was just how lame these ninjas are if a gymnast can kick their ass. Kurt Thomas is like 5 foot 4 and he hardly strikes one as \"The best man for the job\" As to the acting talent of Kurt Thomas, well if you can't say something nice... In all seriousness though one has to wonder how much cocaine was being used to furnish an idea so stupid. Only the decision to cast Tara Reid as a scientist tops the dumbness here. For 18 years though this held the title of the dumbest movie I had ever seen. Not to say I didn't find this unwatchable, I was laughing so hard I almost choked to death. Twice. Only in the 80's could a movie with such a bad idea get made. Although for the record it is the only movie to ever feature a hero so wimpy, he can't even pull a wedged sword out from the ground. This is the wimpiest action movie ever made, and one of the most hilarious also.<br /><br />* out of

{"value":"It is a pity that you cannot vote zero stars on IMDb, because I would not have hesitated! In fact I would go so far as to say that this film was in the negative stars. <br /><br />I, like many others, bought this film thinking that because it has Michael Madsen in it, it could be good... No chance! This film was shocking! Imagine a movie length 'The Bold and the Beautiful', well, Primal Instinct did not even come close to that good, and I had previously thought that there would be nothing worse than a movie length 'The Bold and the Beautiful'. <br /><br />Michael Madsen, how could you do this to us? The worst part is, I didn't fast forward a bit, I was hoping that at the end they would reveal that it was all some sort of sick joke, that they thought it would be funny to make us watch such a horribly bad film.<br /><br />Where do I start...? Directing - Zero Stars, Screenplay - Zero Stars, Acting - Zero Stars, Cinematography - Zero Stars, Digital Effects - Zero Stars, Production Design - Zero Stars, Make-up - Zero Stars, Casting - Zero

{"value":"Let me be really clear about this movie. I didn't watch this movie because of the plot, I watch it for the saucy sex scenes. That being said, this movie is so god damn awful I flip between pure joy of seeing a godly body of Traci (Mandy Schaffer) and cringing my eyeballs out for the disaster of a plot.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert The first scene of the movie already had me cringing.. you see a woman painting something by the lakeside, in pure bliss and serene, then a beautiful girl approach and ask if she could paint beside her. When they both finished, they show each other what they had done... and the woman painted A VINEYARD WHEN SHE IS FACING INFRONT OF THE LAKE. What kind of screwball director would make this kind of mistake?? And in another scene, Traci gets to kill her teacher's lover by smash him with the sail pole, and then she swims away, and none of the town's police suspected her once. I mean HELLOOOOO? MANDY DID NOT WEAR A GLOVE DID SHE? HER FINGER PRINTS ARE ALL OVER THE GOD DAMN BOAT!! After that, it gets worst, whenever Mandy is around, there is the \"chilling\" sound effect played which sounds like a cat in hissy fit. It's also a real pity Rosanna Arquette's is in this movie. I feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft-porn no brainer. Same goes for Jürgen Prochnow, who also has the misfortune to star in this movie.

{"value":"This thought long lost flick sometimes comes available on the web. So I bought me a copy. Well, of course the acting is terrible and the story line is childish but it does have his moments. I think people who searched this one also knows the backstory of it. It was made by a grindhouse cinema owner for an extreme low budget. But for me he surely didn't spoiled the money on props but on the make up. The make up is for that kind of flick well done. The zombies are watchable and the gore is intact. The only problem with that kind of movies is the quality of the pelicule. It's terrible, luckely no hiss on the sound but sometimes it's way too dark. So you have to watch clearly to see the gore. In a funny way they tried to sell this one as really not for the squeamish. A voice-over tells in the beginning of the movie to watch out for a sign and a man appearing with green flashes, that tells you there is gore on the way. Of course that doesn't work, made me think of Cannibal Girls, had that annoying bell when the red stuff started to flow. They had the original idea, Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier. Don't go for the storyline, go for the zombies and notice a continuity mistake. When the girl and guy are making love first she takes of her bra, then they make love and suddenly her underwear is back on...try to do that, or am I getting a bit offline,...eat it you ugly
