{"value":"Felt mine was while watching this...but it seems that is the reason for insanity running in the family in this film. Not that makes a lot of sense anyway, as others have mentioned, this was one of Karloff's last films and it's only his screen presence that lends it any credibility at all. It's sad that all of the great legends of the horror films in the sound era were eventually reduced to starring in low grade rubbish like this. Marginally, Boris did get off slightly better than poor old Bela Lugosi but not by much. <br /><br />Boris does his best and give him credit for trying to hold this mess together. The strident background music doesn't help and distracts from any lucid moment. Apart from Boris, the rest of the Mexican cast are dubbed into some strange, clipped, English monotone that is reminiscent of the type used in porn films of the late seventies. <br /><br />At a guess I think it's Edgar Allen Poe's 'House of Usher' that this is taken from but you'd be hard pressed to find a great deal of Poe in the finished article.<br /><br />Still, there are far better films out there with Boris Karloff at his best, search them out and give this a wide berth, unless you want the curse of the 'shrinking brain' too!","finished_norm":["feel","mine","be","while","watch","thisbut","it","seem","that","be","the","reason","for","insan","run","in","the","famili","in","thi","film","not","that","make","a","lot","of","sens","anywai","a","other","have","mention","thi","be","on","of","karloff","last","film","and","it","onli","hi","screen","presenc","that","lend","it","ani","credibl","at","all","it","sad","that","all","of","the","great","legend","of","the","horror","film","in","the","sound","era","be","eventu","reduc","to","star","in","low","grade","rubbish","like","thi","margin","bori","do","get","off","slightli","well","than","poor","old","bela","lugosi","but","not","by","much","br","br","bori","doe","hi","well","and","give","him","credit","for","try","to","hold","thi","mess","togeth","the","strident","background","music","doe","not","help","and","distract","from","ani","lucid","moment","apart","from","bori","the","rest","of","the","mexican","cast","be","dub","into","some","strang","clip","english","monoton","that","be","reminisc","of","the","typ","us","in","porn","film","of","the","late","seventi","br","br","at","a","guess","i","think","it","edgar","allen","poe","hous","of","usher","that","thi","be","take","from","but","you","have","be","hard","press","to","find","a","great","deal","of","poe","in","the","finish","articlebr","br","still","there","be","far","well","film","out","there","with","bori","karloff","at","hi","well","search","them","out","and","give","thi","a","wide","berth","unless","you","want","the","curs","of","the","shrink","brain","too"],"filtered":["feel","mine","watch","thisbut","seem","reason","insan","run","famili","thi","film","make","lot","sens","anywai","mention","thi","karloff","last","film","onli","hi","screen","presenc","lend","ani","credibl","sad","great","legend","horror","film","sound","era","eventu","reduc","star","low","grade","rubbish","like","thi","margin","bori","get","slightli","well","poor","old","bela","lugosi","much","br","br","bori","doe","hi","well","give","credit","try","hold","thi","mess","togeth","strident","background","music","doe","help","distract","ani","lucid","moment","apart","bori","rest","mexican","cast","dub","strang","clip","english","monoton","reminisc","typ","us","porn","film","late","seventi","br","br","guess","think","edgar","allen","poe","hous","usher","thi","take","hard","press","find","great","deal","poe","finish","articlebr","br","still","far","well","film","bori","karloff","hi","well","search","give","thi","wide","berth","unless","want","curs","shrink","brain"],"filtered2":["feel","mine","watch","thisbut","seem","reason","insan","run","famili","make","lot","sens","anywai","mention","karloff","last","onli","screen","presenc","lend","ani","credibl","sad","great","legend","horror","sound","era","eventu","reduc","star","low","grade","rubbish","like","margin","bori","get","slightli","well","poor","old","bela","lugosi","bori","doe","well","give","credit","try","hold","mess","togeth","strident","background","music","doe","help","distract","ani","lucid","moment","apart","bori","rest","mexican","cast","dub","strang","clip","english","monoton","reminisc","typ","us","porn","late","seventi","guess","think","edgar","allen","poe","hous","usher","take","hard","press","find","great","deal","poe","finish","articlebr","still","far","well","bori","karloff","well","search","give","wide","berth","unless","want","curs","shrink","brain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,11,12,18,20,27,30,31,35,36,37,38,43,51,56,64,67,72,83,92,95,100,101,118,137,144,146,150,171,173,178,182,185,188,192,213,217,226,243,270,285,356,384,386,407,414,417,455,460,468,572,573,588,673,716,801,938,949,965,971,1089,1098,1159,1204,1208,1285,1345,1356,1377,1563,1566,1580,1582,1954,2010,2014,2169,2436,2626,3065,3080,3104,3492,3585,4229,4267,4346,4642],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,11,12,18,20,27,30,31,35,36,37,38,43,51,56,64,67,72,83,92,95,100,101,118,137,144,146,150,171,173,178,182,185,188,192,213,217,226,243,270,285,356,384,386,407,414,417,455,460,468,572,573,588,673,716,801,938,949,965,971,1089,1098,1159,1204,1208,1285,1345,1356,1377,1563,1566,1580,1582,1954,2010,2014,2169,2436,2626,3065,3080,3104,3492,3585,4229,4267,4346,4642],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.430631986809635,4.661380160092228,2.600540117735859,2.6728839783437044,1.4070669811451506,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,3.4279798616619646,1.8610609350701788,1.883428577602134,1.9570915389266579,1

{"value":"A small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. The only hope is a lone avenger and a group of ragtag survivors.<br /><br />Released in 1993, \"Darkness\" garnered something of a cult following upon release. It's easy to see why-it's loaded (and I mean freaking loaded) with gore, and it's energy and enthusiasm, like that found in other no-budget cult horror flicks like \"The Dead Next Door\" and \"The Children of Ravensback\", is actually rather infectious.<br /><br />While that may be true, that's sadly not enough to save it. The film was shot on a Super 8, so the image is grainy and dark, making things very difficult to see (it would have been great if it had obscured the protagonists dreadful mullet.) Also grating is the soundtrack, made up of annoying Casio Keyboard and even more annoying Death Metal (seriously, what is it with these no budget horror flicks and bad Death Metal?) While one isn't expecting Oscar worthy performances, the acting is still strictly amateur hour, as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened.<br /><br />In the end, I'm sure fans of no-budget gorefests will love this. Everyone else though, will wish there was a little more meat on the ribs.","finished_norm":["a","small","town","be","attack","by","a","hord","of","bloodthirsti","vampir","the","onli","hope","be","a","lone","aveng","and","a","group","of","ragtag","survivorsbr","br","releas","in","dark","garner","someth","of","a","cult","follow","upon","releas","it","easi","to","see","whyit","load","and","i","mean","freak","load","with","gore","and","it","energi","and","enthusiasm","like","that","find","in","other","nobudget","cult","horror","flick","like","the","dead","next","door","and","the","child","of","ravensback","be","actual","rather","infectiousbr","br","while","that","mai","be","true","that","sadli","not","enough","to","save","it","the","film","be","shoot","on","a","super","so","the","imag","be","graini","and","dark","make","thing","veri","difficult","to","see","it","would","have","be","great","if","it","have","obscur","the","protagonist","dread","mullet","conjur","grate","be","the","soundtrack","make","up","of","annoi","casio","keyboard","and","even","much","annoi","death","metal","serious","what","be","it","with","thi","no","budget","horror","flick","and","bad","death","metal","while","on","be","not","expect","oscar","worthi","perform","the","act","be","still","strictli","amateur","hour","a","the","actor","sometim","seem","almost","confus","instead","of","frighten","or","threatenedbr","br","in","the","end","i","be","sure","fan","of","nobudget","gorefest","will","love","thi","everyon","els","though","will","wish","there","be","a","littl","much","meat","on","the","rib"],"filtered":["small","town","attack","hord","bloodthirsti","vampir","onli","hope","lone","aveng","group","ragtag","survivorsbr","br","releas","dark","garner","someth","cult","follow","upon","releas","easi","see","whyit","load","mean","freak","load","gore","energi","enthusiasm","like","find","nobudget","cult","horror","flick","like","dead","next","door","child","ravensback","actual","rather","infectiousbr","br","mai","true","sadli","enough","save","film","shoot","super","imag","graini","dark","make","thing","veri","difficult","see","great","obscur","protagonist","dread","mullet","conjur","grate","soundtrack","make","annoi","casio","keyboard","even","much","annoi","death","metal","serious","thi","budget","horror","flick","bad","death","metal","expect","oscar","worthi","perform","act","still","strictli","amateur","hour","actor","sometim","seem","almost","confus","instead","frighten","threatenedbr","br","end","sure","fan","nobudget","gorefest","love","thi","everyon","els","though","wish","littl","much","meat","rib"],"filtered2":["small","town","attack","hord","bloodthirsti","vampir","onli","hope","lone","aveng","group","ragtag","survivorsbr","releas","dark","garner","someth","cult","follow","upon","releas","easi","see","whyit","load","mean","freak","load","gore","energi","enthusiasm","like","find","nobudget","cult","horror","flick","like","dead","next","door","child","ravensback","actual","rather","infectiousbr","mai","true","sadli","enough","save","shoot","super","imag","graini","dark","make","thing","veri","difficult","see","great","obscur","protagonist","dread","mullet","conjur","grate","soundtrack","make","annoi","casio","keyboard","even","annoi","death","metal","serious","budget","horror","flick","bad","death","metal","expect","oscar","worthi","perform","act","still","strictli","amateur","hour","actor","sometim","seem","almost","confus","instead","frighten","threatenedbr","end","sure","fan","nobudget","gorefest","love","everyon","els","though","wish","littl","meat","rib"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,9,11,14,15,21,24,29,35,38,39,41,46,51,52,53,54,64,83,86,88,93,105,117,119,130,131,140,152,160,174,180,181,189,196,228,245,246,256,257,260,271,297,304,327,358,363,368,371,399,410,427,450,485,495,500,630,705,740,744,796,803,838,933,979,995,1158,1281,1296,1314,1337,1342,1373,1691,1708,2085,2142,2335,2395,2544,2963,3166,3703,4429,5294,5339,5372,5729,5849,6585],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,9,11,14,15,21,24,29,35,38,39,41,46,51,52,53,54,64,83,86,88,93,105,117,119,130,131,140,152,160,174,180,181,189,196,228,245,246,256,257,260,271,297,304,327,358,363,368,371,399,410,427,450,485,495,500,630,705,740,744,796,803,838,933,979,995,1158,1281,1296,1314,1337,1342,1373,1691,1708,2085,2142,2335,2395,2544,2963,3166,3703,4429,5294,5339,5372,5729,5849,6585],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.553894005

{"value":"I'll make this short and sweet....this movie sucked!!!!!!<br /><br />I watched part 1 earlier today and thought it was one of the greatest films ever, gave it 9 out of 10 stars. So I thought perhaps part 2 and 3 would be good sequels, I was wrong. This movie bored me to death and was so different from the first one, it had the plot continue and thats it. It was like bad outtakes from part one or something.<br /><br />I love Walken, but I felt sorry for him here. I was so happy about Glenn Danzig being in this film, but don't blink you'll miss him. There was a full cast full of crappy actors and people I don't like such as Eric Roberts and Jennifer Beals. However, it was a breath of fresh air to see Ethan Embry, he's one of the funniest people on earth.<br /><br />This movie will make you like the first one a little less, so don't watch it because you feel you owe it to yourself, being a fan of part 1. I am gonna wait a few days before I watch part 3 and I pray it is better than this crap.<br /><br />The last scene of the movie with the lightning was one of the most beautiful things ever shown on film.

{"value":"First of all, I too was expecting another Hero--a fantastic work of art for the action genre. I've only seen parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but I can imagine that it is better than HoFD.<br /><br />Basic elements from Hero are found in HoFD: Great landscapes, mesmerizing cinematography, and sincere acting (I mean, if you can't understand a word they are saying, without the subtitles, but you still care--that's good acting)<br /><br />What went wrong? What begins with political intrigue wanders into a love story. Worse, it's a soap opera-like love triangle. You have three characters who, I guess, fall in love with each other- for no good reasons. This movie basically falls apart after the escape from the jail (I fell asleep about forty minutes into it). It's almost as if they changed writers at that point. The remainder of the movie is about how a character is \"like the wind.\" Ick. Also, you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief to believe the action set pieces. This isn't unique to this genre, but since the story is weak, you can't wait for the action, and then, when the fighting does breaks out, it really wasn't that good.

{"value":"The perfect murder is foiled when a wife(played by Mary Ellen Trainor, once the wife to director Robert Zemeckis, who helmed this episode), who murders her husband with a poker, has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside..an escaped insane madman dressed in a Santa Claus suit(played by a deviously hideous Larry Drake). She fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband's corpse. She decides to use an ax, once she downs the Santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman's head, to frame the killer for her husband's murder. Santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman's daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child.<br /><br />This episode of TALES FROM THE CRYPT just recycles tired material involving the old \"Santa kills\" theme while also adding the oft-used(add nauseum)woman-murders-her-husband-for-a-man-she's-been-cheating-with routine. It's essentially Trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac. There's nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions.

{"value":"This show is possibly the biggest, ugliest, most generic steam pile I've seen in children's programming that's actually become successful. The lead character, Johnny, while I understand he's supposed to represent an ordinary kid, isn't likable or even tolerable. The jokes are lame, overdone (i.e. the \"Whoa! Didn't see that coming\" gag. Come on, that wasn't even funny the first time. It's not even cute) and lack any form of primitive wit or inspiration. And lastly... it's just plain ugly to look at. While kids aren't especially critical of artistic talent, they still prefer eye candy. I can't stand watching the show, because in a way, the art style is just...gross. Hideous, in fact. Just plain crummy. <br /><br />I just can't stand that this is getting so much airtime. While I understand that nostalgia can be a little irrational and I shouldn't be getting my hopes up on it coming back... I really miss the old cartoons. Bring back Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls... anything but this crap. I guess it's just wishful thinking though.<br /><br />Simply put, I advise you don't waste your time on this show. I believe that truly good cartoons are able to be enjoyed by the big kids, too.

{"value":"Whew. What can be said about Gymkata that hasn't already? This is nothing but pure halarity from beginning to end. If you want a movie that will keep you on the floor laughing, this is the perfect movie to get. From Cabot's wild-style mullet/sweater combo to Parmistan (and it's four billion assorted ninjas), everything about this film reeks of crap.<br /><br />Directed by Robert Clouse, the infamous mind that brought you the mirror scene in Bruce Lee's Game of Death, he once again showcases his complete lack of directing talent. A few other faces you most likely won't recognize will appear for your enjoyment as well, from Buck Kartalian to Tadashi Yamashita, although you won't remember them or care about them after the movie is done.<br /><br />Supposedly based on a book called \"The Terrible Game,\" which, if I could find a single trace of it's existence anywhere I would be interested in reading it, to see where this thing went wrong. Instead, the book apparently is a figment of Gymkata's imagination. Probably something Clouse made up in order to sell his lame idea.<br /><br />Pick this one up and Yakmallah it for yourself. It is easily one of the best bad movies I have ever seen, and that is saying quite a

{"value":"This was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. It was just a compilation of recycled material. People getting hit in the head is not funny. People getting kicked is not funny. After the third time a guy got kicked in the balls not even the youngest audience member was laughing anymore. It just got tired fast.<br /><br />I went with my younger sister. She actually laughs out loud at King of the Hill but this cinematic masterpiece bored her. I'm not surprised. The story is pretty lame. A midget thief steals a big diamond in what was definitely the easiest heist in Hollywood history. Then he hides out with a family pretending to be a baby. I know it sounds exciting but that's the whole story. Say those two lines over and over for 1.5 hours and you'll get the picture There were predictable jokes galore. I really felt ripped off after seeing this. I wasn't expecting much and I was still disappointed. I wish Keenan would just hire some decent writers to write jokes and/or his next script. This was even worse than White Chicks if that is possible. I've seen high school plays that were better, and cheaper.<br /><br />There wasn't anything positive about this movie.

{"value":"On the surface the idea of Omen 4 was good. It's nice to see that the devil child could be a girl. In fact, sometimes, as in the Exorcist, when girls are possessed or are devilry it's very effective. But in Omen 4, it stunk.<br /><br />Delia does not make me think that she could be a devil child, rather she is a child with issues. Issues that maybe only a therapist, rather then a priest could help. She does not look scary or devilish. Rather, she looks sulky and moody.<br /><br />This film had potential and if it was made by the same people who had made the previous three films it could of worked. But it's rather insulting really to make a sequel to one of the most favoured horror trilogies, as a made for TV movie special.<br /><br />On so many levels it lets down. It's cheap looking, the acting is hammish and the effects are typical of a TV drama. The characters do not bring any sympathy, and you do not route for them. I recently re-watched it after someone brought it for me for Christmas, and it has dated appalling.<br /><br />If your thinking of watching this, then I would suggest that you don't.

{"value":"First of all, this plot is way overdone - girl wants to make it, everyone loves her, snobby girl intervenes, all looks lost, girl pulls through, everyone loves her again etc. Throw in the fitting in thing, an attractive male crushing on the heroine, plus single-parent troubles and it's so predictable that you can practically recite along with it.<br /><br />Second of all, I really hate how they keep on dissing classical music. They send out the message that everyone involved in classical music is uptight and snobby and close-minded - in fact, I don't recall the quote exactly, but I remember at one point in the movie, Holly says, \"Why do they have to be so uptight...so classical?\" It's really insulting how label classical music in this way.<br /><br />Third, I've went over it dozens of times, but the only reason that I can think of for making this movie is to promote Britney Spears. there just isn't any point at all.<br /><br />And oh yeah, while the actress who portrayed Holly (I'm not sure whether that was really her singing or not) had a reasonably good voice, it wasn't as amazing as they were making it out to be - especially when she was belting.

{"value":"This is probably the best horror film made since Ed Wood died. <br /><br />I can't spoil the ending, because I have absolutely no idea what happened. I'll try my best, though. There are some kind of lesbian vampires, but they keep swapping bodies, so any character might or might not be the character you're supposed to think it is, or it might be a lesbian vampire. <br /><br />Sound confusing? It's not as confusing as you might think, since none of the characters make any sense to begin with. There's no plot, no character development, and random people show up, speak a few lines, and then disappear, never to be heard from again. There are also zombies, who are *possibly* the enemies of the vampires, but there's also a dream-within-a-dream kind of sequence in a mental hospital, so maybe none of this actually happened, and it's all the main character's hallucination. <br /><br />The upside? Both of the lead girls take their shirts off briefly. The special effects are simply mind-boggling (I particularly liked the incredibly slow, awkward fight sequences). Everyone has a really silly Canadian accent, which adds to the general level of hilarity. <br /><br />Well worth the price of rental.

{"value":"This is the kind of film one watches in gape-jawed, horrified silence, and yet continues to watch, mesmerized, as if watching a train wreck in slow motion. And yet, in the back of your mind, thoughts are churning: \"Who on EARTH green-lighted this garbage?\"<br /><br />Some of the preceding user comments say things like, \"A good way to introduce children to Laurel and Hardy\" -- an insult to children everywhere. That children would need some sort of training plan to learn to love slapstick comedy shows a profound misunderstanding of the nature of children the world over. Others have commented on the faithfulness of the two stars' characterizations of Laurel and Hardy to which I would respond: so WHAT? One would think that the rash of movie BOMBS based on beloved series (Rocky and Bullwinkle, Avengers, Flipper, Mod Squad, ad nauseam) would have taught Hollywood that there are some things that simply can't be recreated.

{"value":"Leave it to geniuses like Ventura Pons, the Spanish director, to convince the higher ups in his country to subsidize this misguided attempt of a film. The sad state of the film industry in that country is a product of trying to make a film out of such thin material. Most of the pictures that are made in Spain fall under two categories: those about the Spanish Civil War, that love to present past history as the writers deem fit. The other type of films show the viewer with a lot of gratuitous sex because the 'creators' don't have anything interest to say. <br /><br />As the film opens we get to watch Pere's penis as he attempts to cut it off and place it in one of the platters at a party. Later on, Sandra will show all she has been given for the audience to admire. The story of Pere's attraction to Sandra, a married woman that seems to be happily married, is false from the start.<br /><br />Our only interest in watching the film centered on an earlier, better made picture by Mr. Pons, \"Amic/Amat\", but alas, it has nothing to do with the mess we are punished to watch in this venture.

{"value":"This is another one of those movies that could have been great. The basic premise is good - immortal cat people who kill to live, etc. - sort of a variation on the vampire concept.<br /><br />The thing that makes it all fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters. Even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive - look how long it took to catch the Unibomber, and that was because a family member figured it out.<br /><br />By contrast, the kid (and to a lesser extent, the mom) behave as though they're untouchable. The kid kills without a thought for not leaving evidence or a trail or a living witness. How these people managed to stay alive and undiscovered for a month is unbelievable, let alone decades or centuries.<br /><br />It's really a shame - this could have been so much more if it had been written plausibly, i.e., giving the main characters the level of common sense they would have needed to get by for so long.<br /><br />Other than that, not a bad showing. I loved the bit at the end where every cat in town converges on the house - every time I put out food on the porch and see our cats suddenly rush in from wherever they were before, I think of that scene.","finished_norm":["thi","be","anoth","on","of","that","movi","that","can","have","be","great","the","basic","premis","be","good","immort","cat","peopl","who","kill","to","live","etc","sort","of","a","variat","on","the","vampir","conceptbr","br","the","thing","that","make","it","all","fall","apart","be","the","total","reckless","of","the","main","charact","even","sociopath","know","that","you","ne","to","keep","a","low","profil","if","you","want","to","surviv","look","how","long","it","take","to","catch","the","unibomb","and","that","be","becaus","a","famili","member","figur","it","outbr","br","by","contrast","the","kid","and","to","a","lesser","extent","the","mom","behav","a","though","thei","re","untouch","the","kid","kill","without","a","think","for","not","leav","evid","or","a","trail","or","a","live","wit","how","thi","peopl","manag","to","stai","aliv","and","undiscov","for","a","month","be","unbeliev","let","alon","decad","or","centuriesbr","br","it","realli","a","shame","thi","can","have","be","so","much","much","if","it","have","be","write","plausibli","ie","give","the","main","charact","the","level","of","common","sens","thei","would","have","ne","to","get","by","for","so","longbr","br","other","than","that","not","a","bad","show","i","love","the","bite","at","the","end","where","everi","cat","in","town","converg","on","the","hous","everi","time","i","put","out","food","on","the","porch","and","see","our","cat","suddenli","rush","in","from","wherev","thei","be","befor","i","think","of","that","scene"],"filtered":["thi","anoth","movi","great","basic","premis","good","immort","cat","peopl","kill","live","etc","sort","variat","vampir","conceptbr","br","thing","make","fall","apart","total","reckless","main","charact","even","sociopath","know","ne","keep","low","profil","want","surviv","look","long","take","catch","unibomb","becaus","famili","member","figur","outbr","br","contrast","kid","lesser","extent","mom","behav","though","thei","re","untouch","kid","kill","without","think","leav","evid","trail","live","wit","thi","peopl","manag","stai","aliv","undiscov","month","unbeliev","let","alon","decad","centuriesbr","br","realli","shame","thi","much","much","write","plausibli","ie","give","main","charact","level","common","sens","thei","ne","get","longbr","br","bad","show","love","bite","end","everi","cat","town","converg","hous","everi","time","put","food","porch","see","cat","suddenli","rush","wherev","thei","befor","think","scene"],"filtered2":["anoth","great","basic","premis","good","immort","cat","peopl","kill","live","etc","sort","variat","vampir","conceptbr","thing","make","fall","apart","total","reckless","main","charact","even","sociopath","know","ne","keep","low","profil","want","surviv","look","long","take","catch","unibomb","becaus","famili","member","figur","outbr","contrast","kid","lesser","extent","mom","behav","though","re","untouch","kid","kill","without","think","leav","evid","trail","live","wit","peopl","manag","stai","aliv","undiscov","month","unbeliev","let","alon","decad","centuriesbr","realli","shame","write","plausibli","ie","give","main","charact","level","common","sens","ne","get","longbr","bad","show","love","bite","end","everi","cat","town","converg","hous","everi","time","put","food","porch","see","cat","suddenli","rush","wherev","befor","think","scene"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,12,13,16,19,22,23,24,26,28,29,30,31,37,51,54,65,68,73,74,76,79,85,86,99,110,114,116,124,125,134,154,159,170,173,179,182,184,213,217,269,286,345,365,415,429,445,450,457,484,485,512,571,572,574,618,785,792,851,885,939,1015,1048,1121,1196,1231,1363,1390,1416,1649,2121,2354,2383,2739,3364,3796,3848,4864,5500,6073,6477,6638,7292],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,8,9,10,12,13,16,19,22,23,24,26,28,29,30,31,37,51,54,65,68,73,74,76,79,85,86,99,110,114,116,124,125,134,154,159,170,173,179,182,184,213,217,269,286,345,365,415,429,445,450,457,484,485,512,571,572,574,618,785,792,851,885,939,1015,1048,1121,1196,1231,1363,1390,1416,1649,2121,2354,2383,2739,3364,3796,3848,4864,5500,6073,6477,6638,7292],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.9073850067444174,2.0064197866819473,1.8950689206770979

{"value":"I can't believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10. I could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons, but what would possess anyone to continue to rate it high after that? I was a huge fan the 1st season. I was hooked - all the mystery, suspense, unexplained events. You never knew what was going to happen next. By season 2, I was still watching faithfully, but was getting a little frustrated that some basic things had yet to be explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. I LOVE suspense, but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching.<br /><br />Now, I can't even remember what finally turned me off, but somewhere in season 2, I had enough. I'm not a big fan of appointment viewing - and you clearly can't miss an episode to stay up on what's happening. So, it was no longer worth the effort to me.<br /><br />It's a shame that they couldn't have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it appears ABC just got greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out. Don't they realize that in the end, they are going to lose more fans than they could possibly gain.","finished_norm":["i","ca","not","believ","thi","show","be","still","rate","a","out","of","i","can","see","if","that","vote","be","in","the","season","but","what","would","possess","anyon","to","continu","to","rate","it","high","after","that","i","be","a","huge","fan","the","st","season","i","be","hook","all","the","mysteri","suspens","unexplain","event","you","never","know","what","be","go","to","happen","next","by","season","i","be","still","watch","faithfulli","but","be","get","a","littl","frustrat","that","some","basic","thing","have","yet","to","be","explain","and","instead","of","give","you","much","answer","it","just","seem","like","much","question","i","love","suspens","but","you","have","to","throw","peopl","a","bone","everi","now","and","then","to","keep","them","watchingbr","br","now","i","ca","not","even","rememb","what","final","turn","me","off","but","somewher","in","season","i","have","enough","i","be","not","a","big","fan","of","appoint","view","and","you","clearli","ca","not","miss","a","episod","to","stai","up","on","what","happen","so","it","be","no","long","worth","the","effort","to","mebr","br","it","a","shame","that","thei","can","not","have","be","a","littl","smart","and","much","consider","of","the","loyal","fan","i","agre","with","some","of","the","poster","that","it","appear","abc","just","get","greedi","and","decid","to","see","how","long","thei","can","stretch","thi","show","out","do","not","thei","realiz","that","in","the","end","thei","be","go","to","lose","much","fan","than","thei","can","possibli","gain"],"filtered":["ca","believ","thi","show","still","rate","see","vote","season","possess","anyon","continu","rate","high","huge","fan","st","season","hook","mysteri","suspens","unexplain","event","never","know","go","happen","next","season","still","watch","faithfulli","get","littl","frustrat","basic","thing","yet","explain","instead","give","much","answer","seem","like","much","question","love","suspens","throw","peopl","bone","everi","keep","watchingbr","br","ca","even","rememb","final","turn","somewher","season","enough","big","fan","appoint","view","clearli","ca","miss","episod","stai","happen","long","worth","effort","mebr","br","shame","thei","littl","smart","much","consider","loyal","fan","agre","poster","appear","abc","get","greedi","decid","see","long","thei","stretch","thi","show","thei","realiz","end","thei","go","lose","much","fan","thei","possibli","gain"],"filtered2":["ca","believ","show","still","rate","see","vote","season","possess","anyon","continu","rate","high","huge","fan","st","season","hook","mysteri","suspens","unexplain","event","never","know","go","happen","next","season","still","watch","faithfulli","get","littl","frustrat","basic","thing","yet","explain","instead","give","answer","seem","like","question","love","suspens","throw","peopl","bone","everi","keep","watchingbr","ca","even","rememb","final","turn","somewher","season","enough","big","fan","appoint","view","clearli","ca","miss","stai","happen","long","worth","effort","mebr","shame","littl","smart","consider","loyal","fan","agre","poster","appear","abc","get","greedi","decid","see","long","stretch","show","realiz","end","go","lose","fan","possibli","gain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,14,23,24,26,28,29,30,35,42,54,64,81,82,85,91,93,94,96,99,134,140,152,156,158,169,194,202,211,219,221,249,255,286,290,297,310,312,365,378,395,401,403,405,433,444,470,494,529,558,574,622,800,804,817,1119,1127,1190,1220,1304,1365,1696,1749,1972,1981,2076,2416,3483,3493,4152,4190,4404,7386],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,7,14,23,24,26,28,29,30,35,42,54,64,81,82,85,91,93,94,96,99,134,140,152,156,158,169,194,202,211,219,221,249,255,286,290,297,310,312,365,378,395,401,403,405,433,444,470,494,529,558,574,622,800,804,817,1119,1127,1190,1220,1304,1365,1696,1749,1972,1981,2076,2416,3483,3493,4152,4190,4404,7386],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,2.2350163994518417,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,3.0904588387038183,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.6219954307453837,1.8113893252729412,3.766857155204268,5.849271697274184,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.0105926690411424,2.035389827120098,4.16224563969396,2.0390708128715254,4.112860414513218,2.2443961816702407,9.268679103988392,2.3131195476980753,2.3451551414151686,2.3106972614914807,2.4214486257841834,2.5378812223426954,5.194609285626992,2.5687161421197025,2.5792094178355414,2.6423424573643777,2.6754694156628323,2.6754694156628323,2.780700890737216,2.86128137739655

{"value":"...then they will have a proper place to file this crap. Sorry, not a \"mystery\" as claimed, it is religious mumbo-jumbo. I kept waiting for the \"unimaginable evil\" that was promised me, but the \"evil\" in this flick would only be unimaginable by a five year old with learning disabilities.<br /><br />I can't believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this embarrassment. Unfortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them, and I will likely avoid anything they do in the future. I'm also a little cheesed off that I now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as I'll be avoiding anything they do like the plague from now on too.<br /><br />It's really unfortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. This could lead to more people getting tricked, as I was, into believing this movie was something other than religious preaching.<br /><br />Well, it's off to the video store to get my money back for false advertising.

{"value":"I frequently comment on the utter dirth of truly scary movies on the market, and sadly White Noise only served to reduce my faith that the film industry remains capable of such an endeavor. I was surprised to find myself growingly increasingly fatigued as the plot wore on and my static-induced headache increased. I found White Noise to be preposterous beyond our best efforts of suspension of disbelief. Even after witnessing the harrowing ordeal sustained by Michael Keaton, I was totally unaffected by his demise. Up until the credits I diligently awaited for something--anything-- of substance to connect me to the characters' story, but such relief never came. Sure, there were the occasional heart-stopper moments, but only because loud noises tend to do that to the dozing viewer.<br /><br />While the acting was lame, Michael Keaton may have played his studliest role to date. Perhaps the only redeeming quality that White Noise has to offer is the stunning archietecture in both of Keaton's abodes. Overall, White Noise leaves one with the morbidly depressing idea that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three malicious shadows, contriving to trick the living into following the dead

{"value":"When the employees of a theater find an old reel of film, they decide to show it at the midnight screening of Night of the Living Dead, assuming it's an old preview reel. Unfortunately, it's actually an old Nazi mind control experiment that turns the audience into a horde of mindless shuffling zombies.<br /><br />I can't understand the hate for this movie. It is a low budget independent production with a lot of camp, but it doesn't deserve a \"1.1\" here on IMDb. It is just so much fun. It is obvious that the filmmakers have a reasonable knowledge and love of old horror movies, and they have created an entertaining tribute to them sprinkled with references and homages to a variety of them. It has the feel of such things as Night of the Living Dead (in many ways, very similar), Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, and various others.<br /><br />I liked the explanation of how the zombies, though really just hypnotized into thinking they are zombies, actually come to have the physical attributes of the living dead-unbelievable, perhaps, but I appreciate the effort by the writers to explain it. The gore effects were decent for the budget, the acting was all right, and the story was entertaining.<br /><br />I liked it.","finished_norm":["when","the","employe","of","a","theater","find","a","old","reel","of","film","thei","decid","to","show","it","at","the","midnight","screen","of","night","of","the","live","dead","assum","it","a","old","preview","reel","unfortun","it","actual","a","old","nazi","mind","control","experi","that","turn","the","audienc","into","a","hord","of","mindless","shuffl","zombiesbr","br","i","ca","not","understand","the","hate","for","thi","movi","it","be","a","low","budget","independ","product","with","a","lot","of","camp","but","it","doe","not","deserv","a","here","on","imdb","it","be","just","so","much","fun","it","be","obviou","that","the","filmmak","have","a","reason","knowledg","and","love","of","old","horror","movi","and","thei","have","creat","a","entertain","tribut","to","them","sprinkl","with","refer","and","homag","to","a","varieti","of","them","it","have","the","feel","of","such","thing","a","night","of","the","live","dead","in","mani","wai","veri","similar","evil","dead","and","armi","of","dark","and","variou","othersbr","br","i","like","the","explan","of","how","the","zombi","though","realli","just","hypnot","into","think","thei","be","zombi","actual","come","to","have","the","physic","attribut","of","the","live","deadunbeliev","perhap","but","i","appreci","the","effort","by","the","writer","to","explain","it","the","gore","effect","be","decent","for","the","budget","the","act","be","all","right","and","the","stori","be","entertainingbr","br","i","like","it"],"filtered":["employe","theater","find","old","reel","film","thei","decid","show","midnight","screen","night","live","dead","assum","old","preview","reel","unfortun","actual","old","nazi","mind","control","experi","turn","audienc","hord","mindless","shuffl","zombiesbr","br","ca","understand","hate","thi","movi","low","budget","independ","product","lot","camp","doe","deserv","imdb","much","fun","obviou","filmmak","reason","knowledg","love","old","horror","movi","thei","creat","entertain","tribut","sprinkl","refer","homag","varieti","feel","thing","night","live","dead","mani","wai","veri","similar","evil","dead","armi","dark","variou","othersbr","br","like","explan","zombi","though","realli","hypnot","think","thei","zombi","actual","come","physic","attribut","live","deadunbeliev","perhap","appreci","effort","writer","explain","gore","effect","decent","budget","act","right","stori","entertainingbr","br","like"],"filtered2":["employe","theater","find","old","reel","decid","show","midnight","screen","night","live","dead","assum","old","preview","reel","unfortun","actual","old","nazi","mind","control","experi","turn","audienc","hord","mindless","shuffl","zombiesbr","ca","understand","hate","low","budget","independ","product","lot","camp","doe","deserv","imdb","fun","obviou","filmmak","reason","knowledg","love","old","horror","creat","entertain","tribut","sprinkl","refer","homag","varieti","feel","thing","night","live","dead","mani","wai","veri","similar","evil","dead","armi","dark","variou","othersbr","like","explan","zombi","though","realli","hypnot","think","zombi","actual","come","physic","attribut","live","deadunbeliev","perhap","appreci","effort","writer","explain","gore","effect","decent","budget","act","right","stori","entertainingbr","like"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,12,13,15,17,18,21,28,29,33,34,38,43,50,52,54,67,72,81,83,86,95,96,106,116,121,168,190,192,195,210,212,217,227,228,238,249,256,259,268,287,309,318,321,323,333,339,358,362,368,383,395,401,423,424,591,592,715,823,908,920,942,961,970,982,1000,1210,1631,1817,1934,1974,2386,2619,2649,3009,3062,3506,3823,3954,4502,5099,5665,5729,7073,7586],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,12,13,15,17,18,21,28,29,33,34,38,43,50,52,54,67,72,81,83,86,95,96,106,116,121,168,190,192,195,210,212,217,227,228,238,249,256,259,268,287,309,318,321,323,333,339,358,362,368,383,395,401,423,424,591,592,715,823,908,920,942,961,970,982,1000,1210,1631,1817,1934,1974,2386,2619,2649,3009,3062,3506,3823,3954,4502,5099,5665,5729,7073,7586],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.6608112036218214,1.717994385570355,3.4244306149452273,1.8113893252729412,7.8283661557066315,1.9209463754160525,1.949757232424728,2.292318797740072,2.031112399272319,2.0323326556775485,2.0390708128715254,2.159084361316692,6.739988699036795,2.2190595059394194,2.4894767118610357,2.558331832813986,2.5318267134339894,2.51289241584188,5.374303583034378,2.5983793339432615

{"value":"This movie had the potential to be really good, considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci-fi actioner THE HIDDEN. And Dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles. But someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one.<br /><br />Dolph plays a butt-kicking monk (!) who travels to New York to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years. He must battle the minion, who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL. The minion, naturally, wants the key so it can let the antichrist out. Along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and Dolph are chased by the minion-possessed bodies.<br /><br />If I'm making this sound entertaining, forget it. The pacing is very awkward and sluggish, the acting subpar at best, and the fight scenes staged poorly. Dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career.<br /><br />The cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine-gun wielding monks at the monastery, but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest.<br /><br />Too bad, I really wanted to like

{"value":"A police officer (Robert Forster) in a crime ridden city has his wife attacked and young son killed after she dares to stand up to a thug at a petrol station. After the murderers get off scot-free thanks to a corrupt judge and he himself is jailed for 30 days for contempt of court, he decides to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of vigilantes led by a grizzled looking Fred Williamson. These Robin Hood types sort out any criminal that the law is unwilling to prosecute, and with their help he attempts to track down those that wronged him..<br /><br />This film is nothing but a big bag o'clichés. The only thing out of the ordinary is the on-screen slaying of a two year old boy, which was pretty sick. Otherwise it's business as usual for this genre e.g involves lots of car chases, beatings and shootings mixed in with plenty of male posturing. I could have done without the prison fight in the shower involving all those bare-a**ed inmates, though. Also, did they run out of money before filming the last scenes? I mention this because it ends very abruptly with little closure. If anyone knows, give me a bell.. actually, don't bother.<br /><br />To conclude: File under \"Forgettable Nonsense\".

{"value":"I don't know why I'm taking the time to review this waste-of-time movie. If you stick with it long enough in hopes of a satisfying conclusion  good, bad, or surprising  don't. It finally fizzles out after stiff, formulaic, predictable dialogue and acting. Indoor scenes are so harshly lit you think if the camera were zoomed out one millimeter further you'd see the klieg lights. Costumes, hair-do's, and sets are starched, pressed, and immaculate. Are we supposed to imagine common people really lived like that in early 20th-century Arizona? Other reviews' comparisons to Sam Peckinpah are an insult to Peckinpah: at least that director wove his violence into the context of chaos and mayhem. HARD MEN's gore is gratuitous exploding squibs from wooden impersonations of bad guys with manicured fingernails. Huh?!? I can believe Heston thought he might have been making something of worth with this film. (He does get to clutch his gun in his cold fingers.) But Coburn? I'll never guess why he signed up for this travesty. Want to see a movie about the end of the West as we knew it, the end of Westerns as we knew them? Watch THE SHOOTIST or UNFORGIVEN again. THE LAST HARD MEN is a mockery of an obituary to the Western.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","know","why","i","be","take","the","time","to","review","thi","wasteoftim","movi","if","you","stick","with","it","long","enough","in","hope","of","a","satisfi","conclus","good","bad","or","surpris","do","not","it","final","fizzl","out","after","stiff","formula","predict","dialogu","and","act","indoor","scene","be","so","harshli","light","you","think","if","the","camera","be","zoom","out","on","millimet","far","you","have","see","the","klieg","light","costum","hairdo","and","set","be","starch","press","and","immacul","be","we","suppos","to","imagin","common","peopl","realli","live","like","that","in","earli","thcenturi","arizona","other","review","comparison","to","sam","peckinpah","be","a","insult","to","peckinpah","at","littl","that","director","weav","hi","violenc","into","the","context","of","chao","and","mayhem","hard","man","gore","be","gratuit","explod","squib","from","wooden","imperson","of","bad","gui","with","manicur","fingernail","huh","i","can","believ","heston","think","he","mai","have","be","make","someth","of","worth","with","thi","film","he","doe","get","to","clutch","hi","gun","in","hi","cold","finger","but","coburn","i","will","never","guess","why","he","sign","up","for","thi","travesti","want","to","see","a","movi","about","the","end","of","the","west","a","we","know","it","the","end","of","western","a","we","know","them","watch","the","shootist","or","unforgiven","again","the","last","hard","man","be","a","mockeri","of","a","obituari","to","the","western"],"filtered":["know","take","time","review","thi","wasteoftim","movi","stick","long","enough","hope","satisfi","conclus","good","bad","surpris","final","fizzl","stiff","formula","predict","dialogu","act","indoor","scene","harshli","light","think","camera","zoom","millimet","far","see","klieg","light","costum","hairdo","set","starch","press","immacul","suppos","imagin","common","peopl","realli","live","like","earli","thcenturi","arizona","review","comparison","sam","peckinpah","insult","peckinpah","littl","director","weav","hi","violenc","context","chao","mayhem","hard","man","gore","gratuit","explod","squib","wooden","imperson","bad","gui","manicur","fingernail","huh","believ","heston","think","mai","make","someth","worth","thi","film","doe","get","clutch","hi","gun","hi","cold","finger","coburn","never","guess","sign","thi","travesti","want","see","movi","end","west","know","end","western","know","watch","shootist","unforgiven","last","hard","man","mockeri","obituari","western"],"filtered2":["know","take","time","review","wasteoftim","stick","long","enough","hope","satisfi","conclus","good","bad","surpris","final","fizzl","stiff","formula","predict","dialogu","act","indoor","scene","harshli","light","think","camera","zoom","millimet","far","see","klieg","light","costum","hairdo","set","starch","press","immacul","suppos","imagin","common","peopl","realli","live","like","earli","thcenturi","arizona","review","comparison","sam","peckinpah","insult","peckinpah","littl","director","weav","violenc","context","chao","mayhem","hard","man","gore","gratuit","explod","squib","wooden","imperson","bad","gui","manicur","fingernail","huh","believ","heston","think","mai","make","someth","worth","doe","get","clutch","gun","cold","finger","coburn","never","guess","sign","travesti","want","see","end","west","know","end","western","know","watch","shootist","unforgiven","last","hard","man","mockeri","obituari","western"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,12,13,14,18,19,21,23,24,26,31,37,42,45,46,53,55,58,91,93,99,101,109,116,144,149,156,171,176,181,219,231,243,248,266,326,337,340,353,358,416,452,501,709,770,776,876,890,939,957,1058,1090,1107,1176,1320,1472,1527,1685,1907,1954,1991,2134,2157,2807,2825,2987,3720,3941,4347,4572,4582,4986,5468,5725,6629,7102,7173,7470,7839],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,8,9,12,13,14,18,19,21,23,24,26,31,37,42,45,46,53,55,58,91,93,99,101,109,116,144,149,156,171,176,181,219,231,243,248,266,326,337,340,353,358,416,452,501,709,770,776,876,890,939,957,1058,1090,1107,1176,1320,1472,1527,1685,1907,1954,1991,2134,2157,2807,2825,2987,3720,3941,4347,4572,4582,4986,5468,5725,6629,7102,7173,7470,7839],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,2.6420723132238515,3.9974772509130565,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,3.63259221292443

{"value":"Well well well. As good as John Carpenter's season 1 outing in \"Masters of Horror\" was, this is the complete opposite. He certainly proved he was still a master of horror with \"Cigarette Burns\" but \"Pro-Life\" is perhaps the worst I have seen from him.<br /><br />It's stupid, totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays it's welcome, despite the less-than-an-hour running time. The script is nonsense, the characters are irritable and un-appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd.<br /><br />And for those suckers who actually bought the DVD (one of them being me); did you see how Carpenter describes the film? He's actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time, and he praises the script. And in the commentary track, where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut, he just says he didn't feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there. I fear the old master has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope I'm proved wrong.<br /><br />I want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome, though. Technically speaking, this film is top notch, with effective lighting schemes and make up

{"value":"I've come to realise from watching Euro horror, especially films made by cult luminary Jess Franco, that you can't expect a plot that makes much sense. However, Franco has gone overboard with this film; and despite a surreal atmosphere, and the film's reputation as one of the director's best - Succubus is unfortunately is a truly awful film. I've got to admit that I saw the American cut version, which runs at about 76 minutes; but unless it was just the logic that was cut, I'm sure the longer European version is just as boring. The plot has something to do with a woman marauding around; practicing S&M and talking rubbish, and it's all really boring. There's no gore and the sex is dull, and most of the runtime is taken up by boring dialogue and despite the fact that this is a short film; I had difficulty making it all the way to the end. I have to say that the locations look good and Franco has done a good job of using his surreal atmosphere; but the positive elements end there. Jess Franco is definitely a talented director that has made some classic trash films - but this looks like it was one he made for the money, and overall I recommend skipping it and seeing some of the

{"value":"Well I guess I know the answer to that question. For the MONEY! We have been so bombarded with Cat In The Hat advertising and merchandise that we almost believe there has to be something good about this movie. I admit, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. Well I should have went with my instincts. It was a complete piece Hollywood trash. Once again proving that the average person can be programed into believing anything they say is good, must be good. Aside from the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with a moth eaten script. It's chock full of failed attempts at senseless humor, and awful pastel sceneries. It jumps all over the universe with no destination nor direction. This is then compounded with, ............................yes I'll say it, BAD ACTING! I couldn't help but feel like I was watching \"Coffee Talk\" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Was the Cat intended to be a middle aged Jewish woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were no prize either, but Mr. Myers should disappear under a rock somewhere until he's ready to make another Austin Powers movie. F-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10.

{"value":"I was really hoping that this would be a funny show, given all the hype and the clever preview clips. And talk about hype, I even heard an interview with the show's creator on the BBC World Today - a show that is broadcast all over the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this show doesn't even come close to delivering. All of the jokes are obvious - the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame - and they are not given any new treatment or twist. All of the characters are one-dimensional. The acting is - well - mediocre (I'm being nice). It's the classic CBC recipe - one that always fails.<br /><br />If you're Muslim I think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters, and if you're white you'd probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted, ignorant, or both. Not that making fun of white people is a problem - most of the better comedies are rooted in that.

{"value":"Do not bother to waste your money on this movie. Do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you. If you must see a movie this weekend, go see Batman again.<br /><br />The script was horrible. Perfectly written from the random horror movie format. Given: a place in confined spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together, and an innocent and overly curious, yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend. Mix together, add much poorly executed gore, and what the hell, let's put some freaks in there for a little \"spin\" to the plot.<br /><br />The acting was horrible, and the characters unbelievable - Borat was more believable than this.<br /><br />***Spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch??? I'm in the army.

{"value":"Having searched for this movie high and low, I actually found it when I least expected, playing on the Sundance Channel very early in the morning one day. Why I searched endlessly for a small vanity project that Chuck Barris that was made during the last waning years of the TV show, I haven't a clue. The film is simply put horrible. The scripted part that deals with a week that is. Of course the highlight of the film is seeing the real performers that were \"too hot for TV\" or rejected for some reason or other. That part is still horrid, but campy bad which was enjoyable in it's own way. Now that I saw what I sought after for so long will I watch it again in my lifetime? Resoundingly NO!! Do yourself a favor and just watch the MUCH MUCH better \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\" or find old copies of the actual show. The girl act where there just lick popsicles provocatively was fun, but having to endure seeing Jay P. Morgon flash the audience has in all likelihood made me sterile. In hindsight, I'm so very happy that this was massive flop, for if it was a massive hit, there could have been a \"The $1.98 Beauty Show Movie\" and THAT my friends would surely have brought upon the

{"value":"Roman Polanski has made many, many movies that are unexceptional. His fame bewilders me. Nothing stands out as a high point except Chinatown (I haven't seen 'Knife in the Water' or 'Tess'). Any contribution he's made to film concluded more than twenty years ago; his work is just embarrassing, safe and/or dull (The Pianist, Frantic, Oliver Twist, The Ninth Gate, Pirates).<br /><br />R's Baby must have signified the end of the establishment at the time it came out. It's lux-produced and fairly high concept for a 1968 'horror' movie (never show the baby). But this is just misconceived horror sap. Everything is arty to the point that the plot line becomes hopelessly clear very early (Um, thanks for that finale-destroying title), and on a clear day you can see the twist ending coming for days. It did not sustain my interest. I find that whatever this movie might have been, it is utterly derailed by the 1960's version of what femininity was. Farrow is such a chronic distracted, helpless waif/housewife. Her frailty is oversold... she's irritating in the extreme.

{"value":"And how many actors can he get to stand in for his own neurotic, compulsive uber-New Yorker persona? In this film Woody is played by Will Ferrell in what is mercifully less a direct impersonation than the one Kenneth Branagh did in \"Celebrity.\" It's an annoyingly repetitive story now: nebbishy, neurotic man with a wife or girlfriend falls madly in love with a shiksa queen upon which he projects all manner of perfection. Everyone lives in perfect gigantic apartments in great Manhattan neighborhoods, everyone constantly patronizes expensive, exclusive restaurants during which all the characters relate fascinating anecdotes and discuss arcane philosophy, there is always a trip to the Hamptons during which the nebbishy main character spazzes out about sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to diseases, and then of course, said main character feels guilty about his lust for the shiksa queen but pursues her anyway, sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing, etc.<br /><br />This a tired formula, and proof that Allen isn't really a great film artist at all. He just seems like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a 20-year-old who is intent upon telling the same boring old stories again and

{"value":"Yeah i saw the rough cuts. The unedited sex scenes. The dire cut scenes. Almost on a par with the film 'The Need' for awful acting. This movie is as bad as bad films get.the bad script, bad acting, bad effects, bad locations, bad stunts bad everything. The best 'actors' in the film were the lap dancers they hired for the vampire extras!<br /><br />Sean Harry, the 'foppish actor' as someone else put it, makes a matchstick look talented here. His amazing ability to badly drive a car, when it is obviously being shook by people on the bonnet (check out the reflection in the windscreen), his inability to turn left, which is class. OH and don't forget the sex scene. plus his noteworthy use of a toy gun which the props guys couldn't even be bothered to disguise as a real gun. The other actors on screen could barely deliver their lines.It was as if half the time they were waiting for a line that wasn't there!<br /><br />The 'special effects' were soooo good to the point that the guys who did it took their real names off the credits!<br /><br />If you want a laugh at a party then rent this movie...then again there are plenty of good comedies that are just as funny and don't give money to people who don't deserve

{"value":"I saw the 10p.m. showing and I must say that this movie was nothing special. Although I did not leave the theater wanting my time back (as I don't actually pay for movies anymore) I didn't really find any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />There were a few lines and such that made me chuckle, but mostly the film seemed to consist of rampant fan service to the younger (in mind more than age as this film is rated R) male audience. The fan service seemed out of place and rather distracting as well. I know you all want to hear Samuel L. say his infamous line, but let's be honest, it's a whole lot of hype for very little pay off. The only truly horrible part of the film was the CG, which looked very digitized and did not mesh well with the live action on the screen.<br /><br />Now I am a reasonable man, I knew going into the theater that I wasn't going to be seeing \"Casablanka,\" and I am at least thankful that this film is an original (albiet inane) idea and not some re-make or franchise spin off. However to be honest, if you are not a part of the cult following you are probably better off spending your money elsewhere and seeing the film either in a second run theater in a few weeks or renting it in a few months.","finished_norm":["i","see","the","pm","show","and","i","must","sai","that","thi","movi","be","noth","special","although","i","do","not","leav","the","theater","want","my","time","back","a","i","do","not","actual","pai","for","movi","anymor","i","do","not","realli","find","ani","redeem","qualitiesbr","br","there","be","a","few","line","and","such","that","make","me","chuckl","but","mostli","the","film","seem","to","consist","of","rampant","fan","servic","to","the","young","in","mind","much","than","ag","a","thi","film","be","rate","r","male","audienc","the","fan","servic","seem","out","of","place","and","rather","distract","a","good","i","know","you","all","want","to","hear","samuel","l","sai","hi","infam","line","but","let","be","honest","it","a","whole","lot","of","hyp","for","veri","littl","pai","off","the","onli","truli","horribl","part","of","the","film","be","the","cg","which","look","veri","digit","and","do","not","mesh","good","with","the","live","action","on","the","screenbr","br","now","i","be","a","reason","man","i","know","go","into","the","theater","that","i","be","not","go","to","be","see","casablanka","and","i","be","at","littl","thank","that","thi","film","be","a","origin","albiet","inan","idea","and","not","some","remak","or","franchis","spin","off","howev","to","be","honest","if","you","be","not","a","part","of","the","cult","follow","you","be","probabl","well","off","spend","your","monei","elsewher","and","see","the","film","either","in","a","run","theater","in","a","few","week","or","rent","it","in","a","few","month"],"filtered":["see","pm","show","must","sai","thi","movi","noth","special","although","leav","theater","want","time","back","actual","pai","movi","anymor","realli","find","ani","redeem","qualitiesbr","br","line","make","chuckl","mostli","film","seem","consist","rampant","fan","servic","young","mind","much","ag","thi","film","rate","r","male","audienc","fan","servic","seem","place","rather","distract","good","know","want","hear","samuel","l","sai","hi","infam","line","let","honest","whole","lot","hyp","veri","littl","pai","onli","truli","horribl","part","film","cg","look","veri","digit","mesh","good","live","action","screenbr","br","reason","man","know","go","theater","go","see","casablanka","littl","thank","thi","film","origin","albiet","inan","idea","remak","franchis","spin","howev","honest","part","cult","follow","probabl","well","spend","monei","elsewher","see","film","either","run","theater","week","rent","month"],"filtered2":["see","pm","show","must","noth","special","although","leav","theater","want","time","back","actual","pai","anymor","realli","find","ani","redeem","qualitiesbr","line","make","chuckl","mostli","seem","consist","rampant","fan","servic","young","mind","ag","rate","r","male","audienc","fan","servic","seem","place","rather","distract","good","know","want","hear","samuel","l","infam","line","let","honest","whole","lot","hyp","veri","littl","pai","onli","truli","horribl","part","cg","look","veri","digit","mesh","good","live","action","screenbr","reason","man","know","go","theater","go","see","casablanka","littl","thank","origin","albiet","inan","idea","remak","franchis","spin","howev","honest","part","cult","follow","probabl","well","spend","monei","elsewher","see","either","run","theater","week","rent","month"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,8,11,13,14,15,16,20,26,27,28,35,37,38,45,49,52,61,63,69,72,74,95,107,111,113,116,123,124,126,129,135,137,140,141,148,160,164,168,202,203,207,216,230,237,238,260,283,322,343,424,442,483,510,634,649,651,661,828,857,933,1103,1231,1352,1356,1600,1601,1632,1808,2005,2050,2140,2192,2352,2420,2532,2892,3996,5249,5356,5722],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,8,11,13,14,15,16,20,26,27,28,35,37,38,45,49,52,61,63,69,72,74,95,107,111,113,116,123,124,126,129,135,137,140,141,148,160,164,168,202,203,207,216,230,237,238,260,283,322,343,424,442,483,510,634,649,651,661,828,857,933,1103,1231,1352,1356,1600,1601,1632,1808,2005,2050,2140,2192,2352,2420,2532,2892,3996,5249,5356,5722],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.967100616408184,1.357228929984541,1.9416538289407692,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,2.2350163994518417,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,2.6649848339420377,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,2.926338025798268,2.975308642954861,1.519311641348122,1.8162961064622165,1.6920303308087352,1.7122153074726136,3.7637034094785053,1.8729627573220065,2.127032521151058,1.9209463754160525,1.9486336368009016,2.0323326556775485,4.287906797278791,2.1183455303375887,2.1521782565202803,2.2466628996789315,2.261

{"value":"This is just typical Bruce Willis, action movie schtick. Watch it with some popcorn and your buddies. Rent it, to save money.<br /><br />None of it is realistic. The battles aren't realistic. The soldiers aren't realistic. The victims aren't realistic. And why was Tom Skerritt's character talking to Willis from the DECK OF THE CARRIER? What's up with that? He can't do that from inside the ship?<br /><br />Of course, Bruce W. gets a machete wound. There's a bunch of average explosions.<br /><br />If this movie accurately represents the Navy SEALS, then don't get stuck in Africa expecting them to come rescue you!<br /><br />The noble attack on the village bothered me the most. \"Front row seats to an ethnic cleansing\"...as Bruce looks at the slaughter going on in town. So what does he do? He crawls into town on his belly. Yep. How many died while they were putzing around? Oh well...a body count was needed, I guess.<br /><br />And if that one African guy was so important, why didn't he get on the chopper with the elderly and children?
