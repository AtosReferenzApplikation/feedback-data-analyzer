{"value":"The premise was intriguing, but sadly this film just doesn't do any justice to it. The casting was quite good, and it was shot beautifully - but stylistically much of the direction was inconsistent (overstylized fast editing been there done that to no effect.... I was waiting for Steven Bochco to run in the credits followed by a commercial), characters were identified exclusively by on-screen coke usage (and pretty much everything else left to Boogie Nights for character development), and no personable characters to draw the viewer into the story. A very forgettable film.","finished_norm":["the","premis","be","intrigu","but","sadli","thi","film","just","doe","not","do","ani","justic","to","it","the","cast","be","quit","good","and","it","be","shoot","beautifulli","but","stylist","much","of","the","direct","be","inconsist","overstyl","fast","edit","be","there","do","that","to","no","effect","i","be","wait","for","steven","bochco","to","run","in","the","credit","follow","by","a","commerci","charact","be","identifi","exclus","by","onscreen","coke","usag","and","pretti","much","everyth","els","leav","to","boogi","night","for","charact","develop","and","no","person","charact","to","draw","the","viewer","into","the","stori","a","veri","forgett","film"],"filtered":["premis","intrigu","sadli","thi","film","doe","ani","justic","cast","quit","good","shoot","beautifulli","stylist","much","direct","inconsist","overstyl","fast","edit","effect","wait","steven","bochco","run","credit","follow","commerci","charact","identifi","exclus","onscreen","coke","usag","pretti","much","everyth","els","leav","boogi","night","charact","develop","person","charact","draw","viewer","stori","veri","forgett","film"],"filtered2":["premis","intrigu","sadli","doe","ani","justic","cast","quit","good","shoot","beautifulli","stylist","direct","inconsist","overstyl","fast","edit","effect","wait","steven","bochco","run","credit","follow","commerci","charact","identifi","exclus","onscreen","coke","usag","pretti","everyth","els","leav","boogi","night","charact","develop","person","charact","draw","viewer","stori","veri","forgett"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,15,17,18,27,74,78,92,102,106,117,120,137,153,193,196,210,260,279,320,331,348,356,484,542,576,705,1017,1125,1194,1391,1426,2138,2451,2779,3208,3569,4720,5181,5770,6662],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,15,17,18,27,74,78,92,102,106,117,120,137,153,193,196,210,260,279,320,331,348,356,484,542,576,705,1017,1125,1194,1391,1426,2138,2451,2779,3208,3569,4720,5181,5770,6662],"values":[0.6786144649922705,3.3716610723085094,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.3002700588679295,1.9486336368009016,2.0064197866819473,2.0489535369135887,2.087553710177271,2.159084361316692,2.2797301185117202,2.2044500422972613,2.2939035841256437,2.3409902041158843,2.517840471459249,2.478925055209576,2.687151791517189,2.6754694156628323,2.7910771187233068,2.938298364153555,2.932274249550174,3.0103169565570433,3.028335462059722,3.291526514503207,3.4471119148061256,3.587125145032839,3.6284289511740746,4.0536665665501035,4.240607069200353,4.499089986959872,4.429617614145104,4.5432147918688095,5.014723312293965,5.143104478942172,5.339219357868463,5.521540914662417,5.719991853386255,6.214688095222362,6.389041482367141,6.437831646536572,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.672870998811443E-5,8.614387802114734E-5,8.681356453034051E-5,8.631195482962832E-5,8.63133689538318E-5,8.61927201127412E-5,8.64490693390742E-5,8.615628217670143E-5,8.634999290672465E-5,9.58006034696256E-5,0.2594883447849534,8.601720694190621E-5,8.762267545379565E-5,8.887263217300276E-5,8.607992979188537E-5,8.584204200593323E-5,8.79832643641873E-5,8.645716896432632E-5,8.618893593441312E-5,8.626037123817088E-5,8.709499092262513E-5,8.65428261409982E-5,8.664136827766275E-5,8.673471463436286E-5,8.740035900949121E-5,8.69432797369557E-5,9.059821004914231E-5,8.60427790688414E-5,8.604508091468312E-5,8.62630756405942E-5,8.809657711893045E-5,8.645215950966534E-5,9.279906972240696E-5,8.669533667691556E-5,8.613643276441243E-5,8.653400918334128E-5,8.605012190624877E-5,8.610097119718456E-5,8.584161072857357E-5,8.586388200276806E-5,8.605715116586091E-5,8.696487176082348E-5,8.652296670201664E-5,8.618087907822283E-5,8.722806712519361E-5,8.621395577054628E-5,0.7337369595144515,8.77684933062772E-5,8.588522387144772E-5,8.607503546844551E-5,8.604518140325341E-5,8.846681625540889E-5,8.607631610087854E-5,8.58562592521301E-5,8.679865456719529E-5,8.609848707488626E-5,9.258946038055583E-5,8.60275307341173E-5,8.588423065810443E-5,8.629430265247566E-5,8.715026960963824E-5,8.628859379350509E-5,8.58683418834278E-5,8.606827316613932E-5,8.584264899805069E-5,8.782886997055152E-5,8.658214312286124E-5,8.639771048126823E-5,8.632215177866661E-5,8.663680974358478E-5,8.583951732207319E-5,8.632396148214147E-5,8.772407883168576E-5,8.59933465051487E-5,8.812163702577545E-5,8.622070417683162E-5,8.689551064147019E-5,8.636444350707059E-5,8.581260410521999E-5,8.591897472166799E-5]}}
{"value":"This is not a horror film, but a boring sex movie. A very bad movie, to be avoided by any serious horror fan. No plot, awful acting and annoying music. If you only watch the trailer you will know enough... It's a shame that such thing is available on VHS or video while there are so many good movies unavailable. If you like vampires try the Hammer Productions or the Italian Gothic from Mario Bava and Antonio Margheriti instead. Those are masterpieces if you compare this with this trash. Rating = even \"1\" is too much!

{"value":"I was thirteen years old, when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York was 16-rated in Germany I entered the movie as fallback. It was so boring. Afterwards I realized that this was just crap where a husband exhibits his wife. I mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access. It is more then 20 years ago, but I am still angry that I waste my time with this film. This is a soft-porno for schoolboys. Undressing Bo Derek and painting her with color - nice. But then they should named the film Undressing Bo and painting her.","finished_norm":["i","be","thirteen","year","old","when","i","see","thi","movi","i","expect","a","lot","of","action","sinc","escap","from","new","york","be","rate","in","germani","i","enter","the","movi","a","fallback","it","be","so","bore","afterward","i","realiz","that","thi","be","just","crap","where","a","husband","exhibit","hi","wife","i","mean","todai","you","do","thi","via","internet","and","you","pai","for","instant","access","it","be","much","then","year","ago","but","i","be","still","angri","that","i","wast","my","time","with","thi","film","thi","be","a","softporno","for","schoolboi","undress","bo","derek","and","paint","her","with","color","nice","but","then","thei","should","name","the","film","undress","bo","and","paint","her"],"filtered":["thirteen","year","old","see","thi","movi","expect","lot","action","sinc","escap","new","york","rate","germani","enter","movi","fallback","bore","afterward","realiz","thi","crap","husband","exhibit","hi","wife","mean","todai","thi","via","internet","pai","instant","access","much","year","ago","still","angri","wast","time","thi","film","thi","softporno","schoolboi","undress","bo","derek","paint","color","nice","thei","name","film","undress","bo","paint"],"filtered2":["thirteen","year","old","see","expect","lot","action","sinc","escap","new","york","rate","germani","enter","fallback","bore","afterward","realiz","crap","husband","exhibit","wife","mean","todai","via","internet","pai","instant","access","year","ago","still","angri","wast","time","softporno","schoolboi","undress","bo","derek","paint","color","nice","name","undress","bo","paint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,57,64,67,72,87,88,89,108,129,130,143,162,202,262,263,313,322,405,536,610,638,789,827,868,875,1161,1170,1678,1948,2246,2387,2650,2666,2744,3618,4156,5546,7798,7976],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,57,64,67,72,87,88,89,108,129,130,143,162,202,262,263,313,322,405,536,610,638,789,827,868,875,1161,1170,1678,1948,2246,2387,2650,2666,2744,3618,4156,5546,7798,7976],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9418936859054116,3.668325173349496,1.883428577602134,1.9570915389266579,1.9209463754160525,2.115024371522662,2.0317223413467334,1.9940046109572438,2.138507503627933,2.4106958340079214,2.2642139034199635,2.3409902041158843,2.3586007221245198,2.597304642813496,2.726701583487816,2.902686292364678,2.907069060519773,2.885344817328191,3.109204957709252,3.6254214301101193,3.477726550625732,3.613480989738201,3.8059428063999263,4.062925891962901,7.889252387867754,3.9282323841582003,4.327618446189983,4.2860694432771105,10.712052952369687,5.501738287366237,5.051537285416681,5.102830579804232,5.290429193699031,5.444579873526289,5.3064295350454715,5.719991853386255,5.878215858601149,12.685042933464494,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.43440792225133E-5,7.384275971608899E-5,7.441681676018118E-5,0.2977784473017949,7.398804779115337E-5,7.388462728597841E-5,7.410437051972121E-5,7.385339259098507E-5,7.40194419402844E-5,8.212053027061601E-5,0.29559249411052907,7.373417693246873E-5,7.511038878035066E-5,7.61818549807609E-5,7.378794312510035E-5,7.358402508680232E-5,7.54194865465297E-5,7.411131353987566E-5,7.388138347832287E-5,7.394261800934009E-5,7.465805620679787E-5,7.418473909790994E-5,7.42692096776747E-5,7.434922642113368E-5,7.491981853723161E-5,7.452800897782497E-5,7.766102489284554E-5,7.375609742720475E-5,7.375807057553868E-5,7.394493623023876E-5,7.551661853911556E-5,7.410701942211203E-5,7.954760761648164E-5,7.43154715320262E-5,7.383637762235547E-5,7.417718117852389E-5,7.376239172682027E-5,7.380597987328592E-5,7.358365539471077E-5,7.360274638976106E-5,7.376841722672165E-5,7.454651771770154E-5,7.4167715534373E-5,7.387447711992117E-5,7.477212947904808E-5,7.3902830547925E-5,0.2515963910246056,7.523538422855265E-5,7.36210406959498E-5,7.378374769812348E-5,7.375815671460648E-5,7.583398850457913E-5,7.378484545962677E-5,7.359621214778514E-5,7.440403590040101E-5,7.380385047709211E-5,0.1493787352844135,7.374302651441366E-5,7.36201893108492E-5,7.397170410728336E-5,7.470544124327752E-5,7.396681045829863E-5,7.360656941123961E-5,7.377795103472968E-5,7.358454540204826E-5,7.52871392646026E-5,7.421844171858558E-5,7.406034557118886E-5,7.39955764517942E-5,7.426530209022554E-5,7.358186092113068E-5,7.399712773439164E-5,7.51973120236495E-5,7.371372370307298E-5,7.553809995743769E-5,7.3908615299613E-5,7.448706118303304E-5,7.403182903306E-5,7.355879084057555E-5,7.364997201388301E-5]}}

{"value":"Humm, an Italian movie starred by David hasselhoff and Linda Blair, I wasn´t expecting very much, to be honest and in fact, I took even less than I was expecting. It doesn´t mean this movie is the worst I have seen because I have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this. Apart from that you are going to love some special effects, they are really cheesy and bad. Now I only want to watch \"Troll 3\" by this same director, sure it is not going to be worse than that.","finished_norm":["humm","a","italian","movi","star","by","david","hasselhoff","and","linda","blair","i","wasnt","expect","veri","much","to","be","honest","and","in","fact","i","take","even","littl","than","i","be","expect","it","doesnt","mean","thi","movi","be","the","wrong","i","have","see","becaus","i","have","watch","wrong","thing","than","thi","but","the","plot","be","much","of","the","time","confus","and","uninterest","and","some","good","gore","scene","be","the","onli","thing","save","thi","apart","from","that","you","be","go","to","love","some","special","effect","thei","be","realli","cheesi","and","bad","now","i","onli","want","to","watch","troll","by","thi","same","director","sure","it","be","not","go","to","be","wrong","than","that"],"filtered":["humm","italian","movi","star","david","hasselhoff","linda","blair","wasnt","expect","veri","much","honest","fact","take","even","littl","expect","doesnt","mean","thi","movi","wrong","see","becaus","watch","wrong","thing","thi","plot","much","time","confus","uninterest","good","gore","scene","onli","thing","save","thi","apart","go","love","special","effect","thei","realli","cheesi","bad","onli","want","watch","troll","thi","director","sure","go","wrong"],"filtered2":["humm","italian","star","david","hasselhoff","linda","blair","wasnt","expect","veri","honest","fact","take","even","littl","expect","doesnt","mean","wrong","see","becaus","watch","wrong","thing","plot","time","confus","uninterest","good","gore","scene","onli","thing","save","apart","go","love","special","effect","realli","cheesi","bad","onli","want","watch","troll","director","sure","go","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,6,7,8,9,11,13,14,15,19,22,25,29,31,32,37,54,58,88,97,100,106,119,130,189,203,358,427,543,572,675,1030,1103,1248,1854,3155,5781,5836,6449,6862],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,6,7,8,9,11,13,14,15,19,22,25,29,31,32,37,54,58,88,97,100,106,119,130,189,203,358,427,543,572,675,1030,1103,1248,1854,3155,5781,5836,6449,6862],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.982619630677639,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,3.838916364248105,2.6390769554676132,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.8113893252729412,1.865701314626681,2.0317223413467334,2.0545557924622586,2.1405462403177813,2.159084361316692,2.1653408989309972,4.528427806839927,2.498193474075453,2.569760528637609,3.2030824725120812,3.233054746047873,3.477726550625732,3.4933926673701317,3.749984152751882,4.297765483040301,4.160564361526816,4.327618446189983,5.0768550934009715,5.850044981634453,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562,6.543192162194399,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0358846576586968E-4,1.0288994452420405E-4,1.0368981573226107E-4,0.13375584454049802,1.0309238389728379E-4,1.029482813463901E-4,1.0325446395950336E-4,1.0290476000391251E-4,1.031361274176356E-4,1.1442390339050311E-4,0.5358040117163869,1.0273864903327267E-4,1.0465621496968327E-4,1.0614915887296684E-4,1.0281356498438845E-4,1.0252943265064801E-4,1.0508690109432153E-4,1.0326413812337899E-4,1.029437615371223E-4,1.0302908361234744E-4,1.0402595042406938E-4,1.033664467535257E-4,1.03484145134509E-4,1.0359563769420145E-4,1.0439068099156718E-4,1.038447471182071E-4,1.0821018301103277E-4,1.0276919229162332E-4,1.0277194160818999E-4,1.0303231374107739E-4,1.0522224144951829E-4,1.0325815484837436E-4,0.23675625588082608,1.0354860480050894E-4,1.0288105193578081E-4,1.0335591581035214E-4,1.0277796255076247E-4,1.028386967647735E-4,1.0252891753448852E-4,1.0255551826595073E-4,1.0278635827368733E-4,1.0387053655547131E-4,1.0334272670954774E-4,1.0293413845646351E-4,1.0418489617174517E-4,1.0297364514128408E-4,1.063949480221554E-4,1.0483037929914127E-4,1.0258100891873923E-4,1.0280771922170889E-4,1.0277206163138443E-4,1.0566445377020815E-4,1.0280924880457671E-4,1.0254641367943479E-4,1.036720073247908E-4,1.0283572973784909E-4,1.105885253940242E-4,1.0275097973433094E-4,1.0257982262821995E-4,1.0306961117409233E-4,1.0409197509315561E-4,1.030627925330435E-4,1.0256084513170378E-4,1.0279964235165004E-4,1.0253015763989538E-4,1.0490249297431405E-4,1.0341340681819512E-4,1.0319312112061718E-4,1.0310287407233486E-4,1.0347870043746066E-4,1.0252641717713709E-4,1.0310503557579175E-4,1.0477733080710956E-4,1.0271015021164195E-4,0.08580500197865426,1.0298170541398453E-4,1.0378769187879394E-4,1.0315338716379621E-4,1.0249427212571145E-4,1.0262132081537751E-4]}}

Only positive things about this were the beautiful wives :) and Molly Shannon who I'm sure tried her best, but the script was just too awful.

{"value":"Poor Tobe Hopper. He directed an all time horror classic \"Texas Chaimsaw Massacre\". Since then everything he's done has been horrible.

{"value":"Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd couldn't save this movie from laying an emu-sized egg. Based on the classic Phil Silvers TV series, it bombed because: A) It was updated to the 1990s, and B) The simple premise of the TV series was turned into a confusing, feeble and silly screenplay.<br /><br />The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks. To expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble, and it shows. No one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time.","finished_norm":["even","steve","martin","and","dan","aykroyd","can","not","save","thi","movi","from","lai","a","emus","egg","base","on","the","classic","phil","silver","tv","seri","it","bomb","becaus","a","it","be","updat","to","the","and","b","the","simpl","premis","of","the","tv","seri","be","turn","into","a","confus","feebl","and","silli","screenplaybr","br","the","origin","tv","seri","us","a","small","cast","of","talent","actor","to","portrai","lovabl","charact","act","out","simpl","yet","hilari","prank","to","expand","thi","premis","into","a","movi","be","ask","for","troubl","and","it","show","no","on","can","pai","me","enough","to","sit","through","thi","stinker","a","time"],"filtered":["even","steve","martin","dan","aykroyd","save","thi","movi","lai","emus","egg","base","classic","phil","silver","tv","seri","bomb","becaus","updat","b","simpl","premis","tv","seri","turn","confus","feebl","silli","screenplaybr","br","origin","tv","seri","us","small","cast","talent","actor","portrai","lovabl","charact","act","simpl","yet","hilari","prank","expand","thi","premis","movi","ask","troubl","show","pai","enough","sit","thi","stinker","time"],"filtered2":["even","steve","martin","dan","aykroyd","save","lai","emus","egg","base","classic","phil","silver","tv","bomb","becaus","updat","b","simpl","premis","tv","turn","confus","feebl","silli","screenplaybr","origin","tv","us","small","cast","talent","actor","portrai","lovabl","charact","act","simpl","yet","hilari","prank","expand","premis","ask","troubl","show","pai","enough","sit","stinker","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,8,10,21,22,28,41,56,69,92,93,96,172,189,194,244,276,306,322,332,334,363,385,427,469,484,632,642,737,752,1078,1105,1232,1706,1745,1929,2107,2559,3313,3368,3578,3610,3747,3945],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,8,10,21,22,28,41,56,69,92,93,96,172,189,194,244,276,306,322,332,334,363,385,427,469,484,632,642,737,752,1078,1105,1232,1706,1745,1929,2107,2559,3313,3368,3578,3610,3747,3945],"values":[0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.5452294193519092,1.5687599167621034,1.8610609350701788,2.127032521151058,2.0489535369135887,2.035389827120098,2.0390708128715254,7.500422683079545,2.498193474075453,2.5378812223426954,2.634508058031767,2.7884729505849193,2.8739486825973213,2.885344817328191,2.9705344631698933,2.942840385588056,3.0349689855553557,3.09496984188738,3.233054746047873,3.328770687675578,6.583053029006414,3.541919708264792,3.622422927113863,7.368341868364619,3.719831114581194,4.280272325592784,4.613282354485526,4.470719289830655,4.671389985292807,5.089758498236879,4.8184434032493035,5.156897801074508,5.243909178064138,5.822646007446338,5.7959777603641776,5.7446844659766265,5.672363804397,5.695894301807195,5.7959777603641776]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.739193078147035E-5,7.687005889945446E-5,7.746765030801876E-5,7.702004139924851E-5,7.702130328591195E-5,7.691364289571557E-5,7.714239484628611E-5,7.688112768565198E-5,7.705398448718446E-5,8.548718957725091E-5,0.7661196985585671,7.675702459515099E-5,7.818965639563558E-5,7.930504902520389E-5,7.68129950167642E-5,7.66007170402246E-5,7.85114261071581E-5,7.714962250638798E-5,7.691026610310249E-5,7.697401103928949E-5,7.771877974225979E-5,7.722605825977154E-5,7.731399184278974E-5,7.739728899753156E-5,7.799127342797066E-5,7.758340102416618E-5,8.084485981642319E-5,7.677984375478076E-5,7.678189779541018E-5,7.697642429927202E-5,7.861254017737708E-5,7.714515234456465E-5,8.280878594326596E-5,7.736215027406277E-5,7.686341516182759E-5,7.721819049168438E-5,7.678639609903273E-5,7.683177120959217E-5,7.660033219202877E-5,7.662020585221709E-5,7.679266862370675E-5,7.76026685587212E-5,0.0663665082439764,7.690307660775912E-5,7.783752962634378E-5,7.69325924287961E-5,7.94886804428545E-5,0.1298509295937055,7.663925016204055E-5,7.680862759171047E-5,7.678198746588351E-5,7.89429212199045E-5,7.68097703576599E-5,7.661340372879316E-5,7.74543454769444E-5,7.682955451547799E-5,8.262174209494957E-5,7.676623697951959E-5,7.663836387307897E-5,7.700428956721355E-5,7.77681074022653E-5,7.699919529545103E-5,7.662418560442787E-5,7.68025932850538E-5,7.660125868660613E-5,7.837365304184967E-5,7.726114257198256E-5,7.70965650262775E-5,7.702914059574598E-5,7.73099240576944E-5,7.659846415120357E-5,7.703075547559464E-5,7.82801431929574E-5,7.673573285369414E-5,7.863490225997009E-5,7.6938614335408E-5,7.75407745106182E-5,0.031770604075541095,7.657444827668986E-5,7.66693675645065E-5]}}
{"value":"The whole Biker Movie genre has to be made up of the worst films ever made. This one delivers a lot of fighting, generous amounts of blood, bikers fighting Indians, and a shanty town that gets blown up and torn down one shack at a time. The acting is beyond terrible. What ever happened to Robert Walker, Jr.? At one point he was in some major studio productions, and then he just faded away. This movie really blows, but if you have not seen a Biker movie in a long time, it is a good one to watch. At the end of the movie, you should feel a bit trashy for having watched it!","finished_norm":["the","whole","biker","movi","genr","have","to","be","make","up","of","the","wrong","film","ever","make","thi","on","deliv","a","lot","of","fight","gener","amount","of","blood","biker","fight","indian","and","a","shanti","town","that","get","blow","up","and","tear","down","on","shack","at","a","time","the","act","be","beyond","terribl","what","ever","happen","to","robert","walker","jr","at","on","point","he","be","in","some","major","studio","product","and","then","he","just","fade","awai","thi","movi","realli","blow","but","if","you","have","not","see","a","biker","movi","in","a","long","time","it","be","a","good","on","to","watch","at","the","end","of","the","movi","you","should","feel","a","bite","trashi","for","have","watch","it"],"filtered":["whole","biker","movi","genr","make","wrong","film","ever","make","thi","deliv","lot","fight","gener","amount","blood","biker","fight","indian","shanti","town","get","blow","tear","shack","time","act","beyond","terribl","ever","happen","robert","walker","jr","point","major","studio","product","fade","awai","thi","movi","realli","blow","see","biker","movi","long","time","good","watch","end","movi","feel","bite","trashi","watch"],"filtered2":["whole","biker","genr","make","wrong","ever","make","deliv","lot","fight","gener","amount","blood","biker","fight","indian","shanti","town","get","blow","tear","shack","time","act","beyond","terribl","ever","happen","robert","walker","jr","point","major","studio","product","fade","awai","realli","blow","see","biker","long","time","good","watch","end","feel","bite","trashi","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,8,13,21,24,25,43,44,66,72,94,99,111,154,155,166,190,225,232,355,404,450,467,502,517,539,754,772,932,1025,1120,1845,2165,2638,2915,4171,5690],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,8,13,21,24,25,43,44,66,72,94,99,111,154,155,166,190,225,232,355,404,450,467,502,517,539,754,772,932,1025,1120,1845,2165,2638,2915,4171,5690],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,1.8837873718108231,1.1317941569733974,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.6608112036218214,3.209458785004948,1.929723173391612,1.9209463754160525,2.08112281984698,2.056430207256609,2.1183455303375887,2.348499626138016,2.3074766467914385,2.4423870329693536,2.558331832813986,2.641219492619754,5.675566812258503,3.185521045582134,3.1419947805322432,3.469984576472117,3.342254038012865,3.3132665011396125,3.4198487640477615,3.6105180246075443,7.493177127501487,3.7398317812878634,4.058285512406398,4.436351646326448,4.186539847930077,4.9227044135737135,4.9909126636002465,5.373120909544144,5.770002273960917,18.89420911248424,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.849736344921132E-5,8.790060503847864E-5,8.8583948425106E-5,8.807210942738933E-5,8.807355238974417E-5,8.795044316396203E-5,8.821202010492914E-5,8.791326215124442E-5,8.811092321274557E-5,9.775425951875794E-5,0.6867331043883278,8.777135076339898E-5,8.94095594998418E-5,9.068500651260857E-5,8.783535271675373E-5,8.759261369923093E-5,8.977750187858878E-5,8.822028490536072E-5,8.794658181510879E-5,8.801947389479752E-5,8.887111392918908E-5,8.830768888377806E-5,8.840824058441628E-5,8.85034905478561E-5,8.918270936941737E-5,8.871630890626947E-5,9.244577399647368E-5,8.779744438120862E-5,8.779979316845667E-5,8.802223344793975E-5,0.09760725977491534,8.821517329318667E-5,9.46915156710853E-5,8.846330955804801E-5,8.78930079510628E-5,8.829869212242433E-5,8.780493696066562E-5,8.785682321818858E-5,8.759217362685754E-5,8.761489907783146E-5,8.781210956755392E-5,8.873834125500489E-5,8.828742445243013E-5,8.793836065592599E-5,8.900690394689785E-5,8.797211187928267E-5,9.089498830456575E-5,8.955835100717786E-5,8.763667616997879E-5,8.7830358583665E-5,8.779989570628443E-5,9.027091481497231E-5,8.783166533195959E-5,8.760712087688991E-5,8.856873440396285E-5,8.785428843733098E-5,9.44776317783041E-5,8.778188508809497E-5,8.763566270209444E-5,8.805409727043042E-5,8.892751991120202E-5,8.804827199103598E-5,8.761944990857413E-5,8.782345837812719E-5,8.759323306970279E-5,0.15563016562057053,8.83478076545304E-5,8.81596138889689E-5,8.808251432220718E-5,8.840358908842206E-5,8.759003752964203E-5,8.808436093085812E-5,8.951303079082893E-5,8.774700374216374E-5,8.991869636569323E-5,0.05329321564018616,8.866756565844068E-5,8.8125668503331E-5,8.756257547314686E-5,8.767111529929448E-5]}}

{"value":"This is just short of a full blown gore fest based on a Stephen King story. Two tabloid reporters, one seasoned(Miguel Ferrer)and one not so accomplished(Julie Entwisle), begin to believe that a serial killer(Michael H. Moss) may actually be a vampire. Stranger than odd is this modern day blood sucker does not wing his way naturally, but by way of a black Cessna he seeks his victims.

{"value":"I stopped five minutes in when Beowulf was given a double-shot, automatic crossbow with sights on it. Not only do crossbows not have telescoping sights, but Beowulf beat Grendel in hand-to-hand combat. The terrible, wooden acting and eternal darkness that plagues all Sci-Fi Original Movies didn't help either. Having only gotten a few minutes in before I felt my bile rise and decided to watch I Love Lucy reruns instead, that's really about all I have to say. But, you might as well just realize that it's a made-for-TV movie and skip it right there.<br /><br />A travesty.","finished_norm":["i","stop","five","minut","in","when","beowulf","be","give","a","doubleshot","automat","crossbow","with","sight","on","it","not","onli","do","crossbow","not","have","telescop","sight","but","beowulf","beat","grendel","in","handtohand","combat","the","terribl","wooden","act","and","etern","dark","that","plagu","all","scifi","origin","movi","do","not","help","either","have","onli","get","a","few","minut","in","befor","i","feel","my","bile","rise","and","decid","to","watch","i","love","luci","rerun","instead","that","realli","about","all","i","have","to","sai","but","you","mai","a","good","just","realiz","that","it","a","madefortv","movi","and","skip","it","right","therebr","br","a","travesti"],"filtered":["stop","five","minut","beowulf","give","doubleshot","automat","crossbow","sight","onli","crossbow","telescop","sight","beowulf","beat","grendel","handtohand","combat","terribl","wooden","act","etern","dark","plagu","scifi","origin","movi","help","either","onli","get","minut","befor","feel","bile","rise","decid","watch","love","luci","rerun","instead","realli","sai","mai","good","realiz","madefortv","movi","skip","right","therebr","br","travesti"],"filtered2":["stop","five","minut","beowulf","give","doubleshot","automat","crossbow","sight","onli","crossbow","telescop","sight","beowulf","beat","grendel","handtohand","combat","terribl","wooden","act","etern","dark","plagu","scifi","origin","help","either","onli","get","minut","befor","feel","bile","rise","decid","watch","love","luci","rerun","instead","realli","mai","good","realiz","madefortv","skip","right","therebr","travesti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,11,13,21,30,43,46,54,59,69,79,121,152,166,185,207,249,315,368,405,505,678,781,890,922,931,1280,1924,2262,2271,2642,2648,2825,2864,2974,3326,3418,3452,6962],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,11,13,21,30,43,46,54,59,69,79,121,152,166,185,207,249,315,368,405,505,678,781,890,922,931,1280,1924,2262,2271,2642,2648,2825,2864,2974,3326,3418,3452,6962],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.982619630677639,1.1317941569733974,1.162015545335049,1.3364419891718522,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,1.8113893252729412,3.7386508898401445,2.127032521151058,1.9469506069506084,2.2190595059394194,2.3131195476980753,2.4423870329693536,2.518833027372001,2.5531798379045583,2.6754694156628323,2.854312708080462,3.1346146732346205,3.109204957709252,3.3956930001684253,3.6715125373103863,3.9363956947973615,3.8767358583910254,4.030886538218284,3.9241755834625858,8.729319435740663,4.8184434032493035,5.064116067623542,5.02684467282631,5.3064295350454715,5.259176650194926,5.3064295350454715,12.778082964734281,5.521540914662417,5.9370563586240825,5.626901430320244,6.600350576034347,13.737229125258052]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.805258190823224E-5,0.04365543536374248,7.812894780953867E-5,7.76775179167596E-5,7.767879057543554E-5,7.757021114939948E-5,7.78009158259502E-5,7.753741837538383E-5,7.771175075763317E-5,8.621694534826781E-5,0.3719139401317562,7.741225588701349E-5,7.885711725463342E-5,7.998203136002053E-5,7.746870409644941E-5,7.725461402292542E-5,7.918163373213436E-5,7.780820518449714E-5,7.756680553101836E-5,7.763109462166039E-5,7.838222099367739E-5,7.7885293426662E-5,7.797397764892791E-5,7.805798586435242E-5,7.865704080381342E-5,7.824568662406114E-5,0.4317331010203695,7.743526984089853E-5,7.74373414157107E-5,7.763352848227802E-5,7.928361095596311E-5,7.780369686343143E-5,8.351567769782988E-5,7.802254718148195E-5,7.751955464976482E-5,7.787735849589005E-5,7.744187811880625E-5,7.748764057101249E-5,7.725422588949827E-5,7.727426919987961E-5,7.74482041884746E-5,7.826511863465758E-5,0.09484285787016462,7.755955466302088E-5,0.05199295732257405,7.758932244392276E-5,8.016723033518978E-5,7.898834784570365E-5,7.729347608020127E-5,7.746429938915899E-5,7.743743185165013E-5,7.961681227452968E-5,7.746545191025479E-5,7.726740901057647E-5,7.811552940264895E-5,7.74854049542348E-5,8.33270371620049E-5,7.742154691229532E-5,7.729258222549226E-5,7.766163162024653E-5,7.843196973600807E-5,7.765649386156818E-5,7.727828292498337E-5,7.745821357104044E-5,7.725516029303564E-5,7.904268457611579E-5,7.792067723379658E-5,7.775469478269748E-5,7.768669478794948E-5,7.796987513945267E-5,7.725234190226542E-5,7.768832345311376E-5,7.894837648654893E-5,7.739078239000614E-5,7.930616393100334E-5,7.759539575614439E-5,7.820269623208396E-5,7.772475575525482E-5,7.722812101781854E-5,7.732385057789243E-5]}}
{"value":"This is the last time I rent a video without checking in at the IMDB reviews. The Limey is directed by Steven Soderbergh who also wrote wrote the truly awful Nightwatch with Ewan Macgregor and directed such trash as Out of Sight with the anti-talented Jennifer Lopez. Terence Stamp is a fine actor and it is a shame he involved himself in such a bad film. There is frequent confusing editing that seems like it was a last minute decision in order to make up for the lack or story, filming and just plain common sense. This film does everything wrong.

{"value":"Just don't bother. I thought I would see a movie with great supspense and action.<br /><br />But it grows boring and terribly predictable after the interesting start. In the middle of the film you have a little social drama and all tension is lost because it slows down the speed. Towards the end the it gets better but not really great. I think the director took this movie just too serious. In such a kind of a movie even if u don't care about the plot at least you want some nice action. I nearly dozed off in the middle/main part of it. Rating 3/10.<br /><br />derboiler.","finished_norm":["just","do","not","bother","i","think","i","would","see","a","movi","with","great","supspens","and","actionbr","br","but","it","grow","bore","and","terribli","predict","after","the","interest","start","in","the","middl","of","the","film","you","have","a","littl","social","drama","and","all","tension","be","lose","becaus","it","slow","down","the","spe","toward","the","end","the","it","get","well","but","not","realli","great","i","think","the","director","take","thi","movi","just","too","seriou","in","such","a","kind","of","a","movi","even","if","u","do","not","care","about","the","plot","at","littl","you","want","some","nice","action","i","nearli","doze","off","in","the","middlemain","part","of","it","rate","br","br","derboil"],"filtered":["bother","think","see","movi","great","supspens","actionbr","br","grow","bore","terribli","predict","interest","start","middl","film","littl","social","drama","tension","lose","becaus","slow","spe","toward","end","get","well","realli","great","think","director","take","thi","movi","seriou","kind","movi","even","u","care","plot","littl","want","nice","action","nearli","doze","middlemain","part","rate","br","br","derboil"],"filtered2":["bother","think","see","great","supspens","actionbr","grow","bore","terribli","predict","interest","start","middl","littl","social","drama","tension","lose","becaus","slow","spe","toward","end","get","well","realli","great","think","director","take","seriou","kind","even","u","care","plot","littl","want","nice","action","nearli","doze","middlemain","part","rate","derboil"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,12,13,14,20,22,24,31,32,37,51,58,60,61,71,108,112,122,129,202,205,221,262,337,390,463,493,496,554,561,563,611,886,975,1153,1433,6238,6448],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,12,13,14,20,22,24,31,32,37,51,58,60,61,71,108,112,122,129,202,205,221,262,337,390,463,493,496,554,561,563,611,886,975,1153,1433,6238,6448],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,2.2350163994518417,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,3.4279798616619646,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,1.9214926742550966,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,2.2489347673732487,2.4106958340079214,2.597304642813496,2.571852579609833,2.6423424573643777,2.726701583487816,2.973659465713028,3.132778125427319,3.3467891931782563,3.342254038012865,3.293679367864308,3.439602492783994,3.4725585804672896,3.459754308221302,3.520060914452293,3.944626193933877,4.086456389373095,4.213208095012239,4.535724120139652,6.437831646536572,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1537217461599577E-4,1.145941930707475E-4,1.1548505365067769E-4,1.148177797803806E-4,1.1481966094043191E-4,1.1465916599978965E-4,1.150001784247089E-4,1.1461069388576879E-4,1.1486838050617735E-4,1.2744019775377856E-4,0.8915894898037537,1.1442568695697032E-4,1.1656138566065881E-4,1.1822415943984408E-4,1.1450912497422204E-4,1.1419267115882869E-4,1.1704106449757448E-4,1.1501095307336955E-4,1.1465413203949088E-4,1.1474915992979405E-4,1.1585942535385026E-4,1.1512489982462938E-4,1.1525598698826704E-4,1.1538016238723756E-4,1.1626564585735937E-4,1.1565760926080966E-4,1.2051963543697068E-4,1.1445970466453764E-4,1.1446276672968803E-4,1.1475275750190895E-4,1.1719180049870074E-4,1.1500428917074772E-4,1.2344736221353624E-4,1.1532777926539413E-4,1.145842889056769E-4,1.1511317093371755E-4,1.1446947258475297E-4,1.145371156209949E-4,1.1419209744561591E-4,1.1422172414403723E-4,0.09939434997084981,1.1568633237623854E-4,1.1509848150637847E-4,1.1464341428501984E-4,1.1603645197954399E-4,1.1468741505388846E-4,1.1849790834064344E-4,1.167553620583354E-4,1.1425011448675394E-4,1.1450261422664368E-4,1.1446290040612435E-4,1.1768431669442555E-4,1.1450431780725385E-4,1.1421158386502493E-4,1.1546521944731246E-4,1.1453381107983887E-4,1.2316852622494022E-4,1.1443942033727587E-4,1.142487932497231E-4,1.1479429770547035E-4,1.1593296066103394E-4,1.1478670340971636E-4,1.1422765696755452E-4,1.1449361857200307E-4,1.1419347861924838E-4,1.1683567902666504E-4,1.1517720183278213E-4,1.1493185752945198E-4,1.1483134442564233E-4,1.1524992292955213E-4,1.1418931266004332E-4,1.1483375181098603E-4,1.166962790335937E-4,1.1439394625107974E-4,1.1722513681776716E-4,1.1469639222313769E-4,1.1559406370102493E-4,1.1488760363525013E-4,1.1415351094738449E-4,1.1429501206433334E-4]}}

{"value":"A so common horror story about a luxury building at Brooklyn which hides the gates to hell. It is reminiscent of Polanski's \"The Tenant\" (released a year before \"The sentinel\"), but is too far from the movie of the polish filmmaker in any aspect possible. \"The tenant\" was so disturbing, whereas \"The sentinel\" is not at all.<br /><br />What it's more surprising from this film is the cast: it is full of great names of American cinema (Burguess, Gardner, Wallach), veteran

{"value":"We went into this movie because my husband had enjoyed the original version of `My favourite Martian'. We had our 6 year old daughter with us. She wanted to leave halfway through the movie which was fine with both her parents! The parts we did see were only occasionally humorous, mostly either too silly or gross. I would expect that this movie might appeal to kids between 9-12, if that. It's definitely not suited for younger children. From what I've heard the original series was by far superior and if you are going to \"relive the past\" you'll probably be disappointed.","finished_norm":["we","go","into","thi","movi","becaus","my","husband","have","enjoi","the","origin","version","of","my","favourit","martian","we","have","our","year","old","daughter","with","u","she","want","to","leav","halfwai","through","the","movi","which","be","fine","with","both","her","parent","the","part","we","do","see","be","onli","occasion","humor","mostli","either","too","silli","or","gross","i","would","expect","that","thi","movi","mai","appeal","to","kid","between","if","that","it","definit","not","suit","for","young","child","from","what","i","have","hear","the","origin","seri","be","by","far","superior","and","if","you","be","go","to","reliv","the","past","you","will","probabl","be","disappoint"],"filtered":["go","thi","movi","becaus","husband","enjoi","origin","version","favourit","martian","year","old","daughter","u","want","leav","halfwai","movi","fine","parent","part","see","onli","occasion","humor","mostli","either","silli","gross","expect","thi","movi","mai","appeal","kid","definit","suit","young","child","hear","origin","seri","far","superior","go","reliv","past","probabl","disappoint"],"filtered2":["go","becaus","husband","enjoi","origin","version","favourit","martian","year","old","daughter","u","want","leav","halfwai","fine","parent","part","see","onli","occasion","humor","mostli","either","silli","gross","expect","mai","appeal","kid","definit","suit","young","child","hear","origin","far","superior","go","reliv","past","probabl","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,11,22,37,46,57,61,67,69,74,101,112,114,130,135,148,180,187,200,207,216,220,369,385,392,426,440,464,510,536,670,689,888,1099,1396,1642,1655,2310,3631,7531],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,11,22,37,46,57,61,67,69,74,101,112,114,130,135,148,180,187,200,207,216,220,369,385,392,426,440,464,510,536,670,689,888,1099,1396,1642,1655,2310,3631,7531],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.9416538289407692,0.9913098153388195,1.2979240167361772,1.4876543214774305,1.655771293751733,1.834162586674748,1.8818517047392527,1.9570915389266579,4.254065042302116,1.9486336368009016,2.098582041218749,2.2466628996789315,2.4433074195966826,2.2642139034199635,2.366244071437088,2.3018654096236517,2.7097314792693545,2.4732161909892554,2.5308211829319704,2.5531798379045583,2.6070186965339692,2.8336934208777267,3.121829110937649,3.09496984188738,3.0670934723591254,3.3909310864081816,3.212973749990824,3.2872346624216657,3.374440724508766,3.6254214301101193,3.7264536553416874,3.634471265630037,3.9323057095458362,4.135246553542527,4.409683399244287,4.6295428753573065,4.760735085628657,5.064116067623542,6.0662680901040895,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.995195627704284E-5,9.927795686900689E-5,1.0004974831725249E-4,9.947165980560975E-5,9.947328953676307E-5,9.933424575655216E-5,9.9629679721448E-5,9.929225224609443E-5,9.951549742546269E-5,1.1040701205659102E-4,0.9357445711657701,9.91319726594457E-5,1.0098222176987908E-4,1.0242275535285877E-4,9.920425865977418E-5,9.89301008914459E-5,1.0139778850678073E-4,9.963901427040152E-5,9.932988461677683E-5,9.941221143057138E-5,1.0037408288259645E-4,9.973773132013853E-5,9.985129785810145E-5,9.995887643231051E-5,1.0072600945536604E-4,1.0019924078245629E-4,1.0441142651437113E-4,9.916144368597989E-5,9.916409648682245E-5,9.941532816449728E-5,1.0152837769125347E-4,9.96332410403683E-5,1.0694784415351509E-4,9.991349464487713E-5,9.926937645802486E-5,0.05644488481567163,9.916990606209033E-5,9.922850818017819E-5,9.89296038586202E-5,9.895527076205766E-5,9.917800705021189E-5,1.0022412487246366E-4,9.971484397663897E-5,9.932059935774585E-5,1.0052744878395097E-4,9.935871914651425E-5,1.0265991598760156E-4,1.0115027199935494E-4,9.897986655652332E-5,9.91986181146475E-5,9.916421229656047E-5,1.0195506599304436E-4,9.92000940009713E-5,9.894648579525047E-5,1.0003256508018385E-4,9.92256453117765E-5,1.0670627635232405E-4,9.914387048691064E-5,9.897872191114954E-5,9.945131625802096E-5,1.0043778973247518E-4,9.944473698776203E-5,9.896041062631675E-5,9.919082478595006E-5,9.893080042969101E-5,1.0121985409862202E-4,9.978304283523726E-5,9.957049034447509E-5,9.948341145053302E-5,9.984604429905611E-5,9.892719127719213E-5,9.948549707365157E-5,1.0109908579327577E-4,9.910447429896202E-5,1.0155725840115474E-4,9.936649646050939E-5,1.0014418848727036E-4,9.953215126216972E-5,9.889617468909168E-5,9.901876328986563E-5]}}

way.","finished_norm":["the","old","axiom","that","bore","peopl","be","bore","peopl","be","good","demonstr","in","woman","in","love","the","script","take","from","have","h","lawrenc","novel","contain","a","endless","flow","of","concept","that","be","at","well","sophomoricbr","br","what","a","piti","so","much","effort","go","into","so","vacuou","a","exercis","what","a","empti","arrai","of","charact","give","such","attent","in","spite","of","high","product","valu","thi","film","come","across","a","tediou","a","it","personnelbr","br","a","revisit","in","mere","confirm","a","impress","of","juvenil","mind","in","adult","bodi","dawdl","nowher","and","fumbl","everi","step","of","the","wai"],"filtered":["old","axiom","bore","peopl","bore","peopl","good","demonstr","woman","love","script","take","h","lawrenc","novel","contain","endless","flow","concept","well","sophomoricbr","br","piti","much","effort","go","vacuou","exercis","empti","arrai","charact","give","attent","spite","high","product","valu","thi","film","come","across","tediou","personnelbr","br","revisit","mere","confirm","impress","juvenil","mind","adult","bodi","dawdl","nowher","fumbl","everi","step","wai"],"filtered2":["old","axiom","bore","peopl","bore","peopl","good","demonstr","woman","love","script","take","h","lawrenc","novel","contain","endless","flow","concept","well","sophomoricbr","piti","effort","go","vacuou","exercis","empti","arrai","charact","give","attent","spite","high","product","valu","come","across","tediou","personnelbr","revisit","mere","confirm","impress","juvenil","mind","adult","bodi","dawdl","nowher","fumbl","everi","step","wai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,10,20,23,30,31,33,34,54,67,70,77,85,108,190,211,238,376,401,418,451,474,503,636,711,726,734,799,836,1060,1144,1235,1266,1321,1815,1899,2082,2106,2600,2942,2988,3565,4924,4941,6208,6235],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,10,20,23,30,31,33,34,54,67,70,77,85,108,190,211,238,376,401,418,451,474,503,636,711,726,734,799,836,1060,1144,1235,1266,1321,1815,1899,2082,2106,2600,2942,2988,3565,4924,4941,6208,6235],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.165345040023057,2.729695454751562,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.8113893252729412,1.9570915389266579,2.094675786251684,1.9463902258768238,2.011190219103739,4.277015007255866,2.558331832813986,2.5687161421197025,2.597304642813496,3.1569204307489187,3.0879275592619675,3.164467636384302,3.216957819005698,3.6466665387238555,3.3490645070153917,3.530930586689197,3.6375061693251913,3.7034641371169887,3.79165684915245,3.7636829971100436,3.8463152616903136,4.160564361526816,4.229557233013768,4.297765483040301,4.327618446189983,4.370968887063596,4.838444069955973,4.828393734102471,4.944927550358424,5.00274712124725,5.243909178064138,5.672363804397,5.390512652256013,5.649374286172302,6.101359409915359,6.101359409915359,6.489124940924123,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.48793393469042E-5,7.437441045632751E-5,7.495260057796993E-5,7.451952365333364E-5,7.452074457182908E-5,7.441657946300788E-5,7.463790479705856E-5,7.438511988545627E-5,7.455236475155116E-5,0.15656357004030302,0.5883858072723057,7.426504590185374E-5,7.565116615579287E-5,7.673034666429207E-5,7.431919919859985E-5,7.411381299773009E-5,7.596248935418527E-5,7.464489780534752E-5,7.441331230068971E-5,7.447498770612534E-5,7.519557689264062E-5,7.471885201036672E-5,7.480393075871066E-5,7.488452360416061E-5,7.545922385113102E-5,7.506459335378689E-5,7.822016625661242E-5,7.428712421906685E-5,7.428911157361105E-5,7.44773226176767E-5,7.606032067458549E-5,7.464057277093211E-5,0.1077481533726446,7.485052568768188E-5,7.43679824129996E-5,7.471123967571433E-5,7.429346383617947E-5,7.433736580718828E-5,7.411344064394124E-5,7.413266908972725E-5,7.429953271828237E-5,7.5083235352297E-5,7.470170588112135E-5,7.440635621810962E-5,7.531047146598882E-5,7.443491378421777E-5,0.05716333467117088,7.577706154222603E-5,7.415109511067671E-5,7.431497356552199E-5,7.428919833286016E-5,7.637997563017831E-5,7.431607923065346E-5,7.412608780272489E-5,7.49397276989642E-5,7.433522107983585E-5,7.993936061925175E-5,7.427395919873578E-5,7.415023759580089E-5,0.03841256828055031,7.524330309039075E-5,7.449935433510433E-5,7.41365196360736E-5,7.430913516749644E-5,7.411433705912512E-5,7.582918920252963E-5,7.475279728209303E-5,7.45935628791095E-5,7.452832743708006E-5,7.479999503753833E-5,7.411163325056765E-5,7.452988988855234E-5,7.57387152262794E-5,7.424444541395099E-5,0.0461908865502122,7.444074018477602E-5,7.502335074437135E-5,7.456484102852125E-5,7.408839707078422E-5,7.418023472738768E-5]}}

{"value":"Spike Lee has been in a decline since his early successes and this mess does nothing to help. I looked at my watch frequently hoping the movie would end or get to the point. Lee's first movie with an all-white cast is a major disappointment.<br /><br />What's the point? That Italians swear and like funky sex, but not with their wives? If I wanted to see Scorsese, I'd go to a Scorsese movie. The incredibly lame Godfather character only adds to the stereotype.<br /><br />I've admired several of Lee's films, especially \"Do the Right Thing\". This movie is a waste of time.","finished_norm":["spike","lee","have","be","in","a","declin","sinc","hi","earli","success","and","thi","mess","doe","noth","to","help","i","look","at","my","watch","frequent","hope","the","movi","would","end","or","get","to","the","point","lee","movi","with","a","allwhit","cast","be","a","major","disappointmentbr","br","what","the","point","that","italian","swear","and","like","funki","sex","but","not","with","their","wife","if","i","want","to","see","scorses","i","have","go","to","a","scorses","movi","the","incredibli","lame","godfath","charact","onli","add","to","the","stereotypebr","br","i","have","admir","sever","of","lee","film","especi","do","the","right","thing","thi","movi","be","a","wast","of","time"],"filtered":["spike","lee","declin","sinc","hi","earli","success","thi","mess","doe","noth","help","look","watch","frequent","hope","movi","end","get","point","lee","movi","allwhit","cast","major","disappointmentbr","br","point","italian","swear","like","funki","sex","wife","want","see","scorses","go","scorses","movi","incredibli","lame","godfath","charact","onli","add","stereotypebr","br","admir","sever","lee","film","especi","right","thing","thi","movi","wast","time"],"filtered2":["spike","lee","declin","sinc","earli","success","mess","doe","noth","help","look","watch","frequent","hope","end","get","point","lee","allwhit","cast","major","disappointmentbr","point","italian","swear","like","funki","sex","wife","want","see","scorses","go","scorses","incredibli","lame","godfath","charact","onli","add","stereotypebr","admir","sever","lee","especi","right","thing","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,7,8,10,11,16,18,24,29,37,49,66,89,92,121,162,181,185,254,263,266,267,299,316,372,404,407,532,570,687,1030,1273,1596,1762,2591,2667,3330,3869,5259,6636],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,7,8,10,11,16,18,24,29,37,49,66,89,92,121,162,181,185,254,263,266,267,299,316,372,404,407,532,570,687,1030,1273,1596,1762,2591,2667,3330,3869,5259,6636],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.4876543214774305,1.6920303308087352,3.859446346783224,1.9940046109572438,2.0489535369135887,2.2190595059394194,2.3586007221245198,2.4442286541160034,2.518833027372001,2.889652074525771,2.902686292364678,2.747702973022204,2.7085302779237206,2.7949961309240425,2.878207028279898,3.070535816550098,3.1419947805322432,3.120015873813468,3.4446025032006995,11.833878581801631,3.604618302480356,4.297765483040301,4.409683399244287,4.646072177308517,4.74221603786142,5.501738287366237,5.482320201509136,5.626901430320244,13.086384324388797,6.214688095222362,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.847565599669515E-5,8.787904396438957E-5,8.856221973422544E-5,8.805050628511617E-5,8.805194889352784E-5,8.79288698651162E-5,8.819038264406985E-5,8.789169797250158E-5,8.808931054986785E-5,9.773028144908387E-5,0.3276425110029048,8.7749821393995E-5,8.938762829543425E-5,9.066276245475108E-5,8.781380764835818E-5,8.757112817210859E-5,8.975548042186858E-5,8.819864541723468E-5,8.792500946341034E-5,8.799788366345504E-5,8.884931479969541E-5,8.82860279563951E-5,8.83865549927814E-5,8.848178159242847E-5,8.916083380890974E-5,8.869454774878485E-5,9.242309804126852E-5,8.777590861132052E-5,8.77782568224363E-5,8.800064253970852E-5,8.987107559571664E-5,8.819353505888418E-5,9.466828885957364E-5,8.84416104585855E-5,8.787144874045767E-5,8.827703340185028E-5,8.778339935292827E-5,8.78352728833097E-5,8.757068820768025E-5,8.759340808434518E-5,8.779057020045316E-5,0.09243897662461303,8.826576849569447E-5,8.79167903207896E-5,8.898507150957165E-5,8.795053326533377E-5,9.087269274043054E-5,8.953638330581205E-5,8.761517983480575E-5,8.780881474027664E-5,8.777835933511264E-5,9.024877232935961E-5,8.781012116803992E-5,8.758563179131274E-5,8.854700944491824E-5,8.783273872420658E-5,9.445445743021355E-5,8.776035313473432E-5,0.573092814399356,8.803249854634585E-5,8.890570694592695E-5,8.802667469582987E-5,8.759795779881795E-5,8.780191622728513E-5,8.757174739065554E-5,8.9597976116074E-5,8.832613688644397E-5,8.813798928279139E-5,8.80609086277251E-5,8.838190463774917E-5,8.756855263442642E-5,8.806275478342279E-5,8.94910742060253E-5,8.77254803448225E-5,8.989664027548222E-5,8.795741760240173E-5,8.86458164571511E-5,8.81040522235919E-5,8.754109731407869E-5,8.7649610516573E-5]}}
{"value":"At a panel discussion that I attended after viewing this film, the filmmakers stated that one should look at this not as a movie but a provoker of thought. Well, the only thoughts that were provoked from me were of the time wasted watching the movie. The gimmicks of the film (documentary style, futuristic setting) served as distractions of what was supposed to be a thoughtful examination of the abortion debate. This film illustrates the problem when people try to use film as a platform for their political views - usually a very boring movie that preaches to the choir.","finished_norm":["at","a","panel","discuss","that","i","attend","after","view","thi","film","the","filmmak","state","that","on","should","look","at","thi","not","a","a","movi","but","a","provok","of","think","good","the","onli","thought","that","be","provok","from","me","be","of","the","time","wast","watch","the","movi","the","gimmick","of","the","film","documentari","styl","futurist","set","serv","a","distract","of","what","be","suppos","to","be","a","thought","examin","of","the","abort","debat","thi","film","illustr","the","problem","when","peopl","try","to","us","film","a","a","platform","for","their","polit","view","usual","a","veri","bore","movi","that","preach","to","the","choir"],"filtered":["panel","discuss","attend","view","thi","film","filmmak","state","look","thi","movi","provok","think","good","onli","thought","provok","time","wast","watch","movi","gimmick","film","documentari","styl","futurist","set","serv","distract","suppos","thought","examin","abort","debat","thi","film","illustr","problem","peopl","try","us","film","platform","polit","view","usual","veri","bore","movi","preach","choir"],"filtered2":["panel","discuss","attend","view","filmmak","state","look","provok","think","good","onli","thought","provok","time","wast","watch","gimmick","documentari","styl","futurist","set","serv","distract","suppos","thought","examin","abort","debat","illustr","problem","peopl","try","us","platform","polit","view","usual","veri","bore","preach","choir"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,8,11,12,15,16,23,36,56,89,108,109,149,167,265,312,323,380,498,575,624,815,1326,1356,1813,1876,2525,2654,2710,2783,2817,2872,3189,3383,4489,6086,6858],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,8,11,12,15,16,23,36,56,89,108,109,149,167,265,312,323,380,498,575,624,815,1326,1356,1813,1876,2525,2654,2710,2783,2817,2872,3189,3383,4489,6086,6858],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.364847727375781,1.4680183469605717,1.8610609350701788,1.9940046109572438,2.138507503627933,2.125691139326857,2.3253197803590226,2.4609576687888097,2.73529586597515,5.764967170094317,3.0433232530252132,3.102062070196872,3.386191741044285,3.6314455447135003,3.9241755834625858,3.7881170224473255,4.456830177669989,4.396611317676934,9.466167108596293,4.890269137820559,5.3064295350454715,5.290429193699031,5.463272006538442,5.373120909544144,5.3560264761848435,10.964640403018272,5.583416318380505,5.7959777603641776,6.137727054086234,6.543192162194399,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.526132230069196E-5,8.46863852719484E-5,8.534474116480751E-5,8.485161834114927E-5,8.485300853938354E-5,8.473440099031656E-5,0.05967408278423649,8.469857955807015E-5,8.488901284121105E-5,9.417972583869767E-5,0.38223673602036984,8.456185737668933E-5,8.614016251064758E-5,8.736897085695919E-5,8.462351900094759E-5,8.438965610603952E-5,8.649465051480643E-5,8.49943755566411E-5,8.473068083757686E-5,8.480090750713269E-5,8.562140602399645E-5,8.507858347520221E-5,8.517545834945672E-5,8.526722535262436E-5,8.592160750143343E-5,8.547226168298463E-5,8.906535319070588E-5,8.458699684154282E-5,8.458925974180071E-5,8.480356615300297E-5,8.660604609885534E-5,8.498945085836693E-5,9.122897589380532E-5,8.522851364202798E-5,8.46790659836277E-5,8.506991569415715E-5,8.459421544339771E-5,8.46442044007318E-5,8.438923212558405E-5,8.441112658576227E-5,8.460112577296916E-5,8.549348838526545E-5,8.505906004371165E-5,8.472276029762574E-5,8.575223067248135E-5,0.43447945186567044,8.757127434424457E-5,8.628351322945026E-5,8.443210736530165E-5,8.46187074859567E-5,8.458935853017632E-5,8.697002105418379E-5,8.46199664510057E-5,8.440363280660829E-5,0.07982673827444173,8.464176230800451E-5,9.102291299196745E-5,8.45720064977266E-5,8.443113095641713E-5,8.483426482619756E-5,8.567574943519707E-5,8.482865255703401E-5,8.44155110084339E-5,8.461205959696465E-5,8.439025282828488E-5,8.634286836378625E-5,8.511723524187756E-5,8.493592306855243E-5,8.486164276510942E-5,8.517097694251208E-5,8.438717413802307E-5,8.486342184969697E-5,8.623985021597436E-5,8.453840064144103E-5,0.03737704953767036,8.476191158407523E-5,8.542530080639878E-5,8.490321894774373E-5,8.436071627353294E-5,8.446528717529706E-5]}}
{"value":"\"Cement\" is a bad movie about a bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast drying concrete. While we're waiting for the cement to dry and the film to figure out what it's about, we're periodically jerked back in time without rhyme or reason so we can watch events leading up to the cement thing. A boring junk flick overall, \"Cement\" suffers from lack of a story, a clumsy execution, and that most ubiquitous of filmdom's faults; no reason to care. A time killer for the needy couch potato at best.

{"value":"I actually saw China O'Brien II before I ever saw the original China O'Brien. And I have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse. But: worse = funnier! And funnier = better. If you're a bad movie fan like I am, this is great material. If, however, you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot, acting ability, or movie-making skill, this is best avoided. The best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast-forward. Hilariously bad. See it for a laugh, see it for mindless entertainment, but whatever you do, see it for free on TV.","finished_norm":["i","actual","see","china","o","brien","ii","befor","i","ever","see","the","origin","china","o","brien","and","i","have","to","sai","that","the","incarn","be","actual","wrong","but","wrong","funni","and","funni","well","if","you","re","a","bad","movi","fan","like","i","be","thi","be","great","materi","if","howev","you","be","look","for","ani","sort","of","meaning","plot","act","abil","or","moviemak","skill","thi","be","well","avoid","the","well","part","be","how","thei","film","all","the","fight","sequenc","in","stutter","fastforward","hilari","bad","see","it","for","a","laugh","see","it","for","mindless","entertain","but","whatev","you","do","see","it","for","free","on","tv"],"filtered":["actual","see","china","o","brien","ii","befor","ever","see","origin","china","o","brien","sai","incarn","actual","wrong","wrong","funni","funni","well","re","bad","movi","fan","like","thi","great","materi","howev","look","ani","sort","meaning","plot","act","abil","moviemak","skill","thi","well","avoid","well","part","thei","film","fight","sequenc","stutter","fastforward","hilari","bad","see","laugh","see","mindless","entertain","whatev","see","free","tv"],"filtered2":["actual","see","china","o","brien","ii","befor","ever","see","origin","china","o","brien","incarn","actual","wrong","wrong","funni","funni","well","re","bad","fan","like","great","materi","howev","look","ani","sort","meaning","plot","act","abil","moviemak","skill","well","avoid","well","part","fight","sequenc","stutter","fastforward","hilari","bad","see","laugh","see","mindless","entertain","whatev","see","free","tv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,16,20,21,25,27,32,44,51,52,61,62,68,69,79,113,133,140,172,195,232,269,335,349,537,556,632,686,847,976,994,1169,1817,2524,2880,3258,4564,5825,6079,6999],"values":[1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,16,20,21,25,27,32,44,51,52,61,62,68,69,79,113,133,140,172,195,232,269,335,349,537,556,632,686,847,976,994,1169,1817,2524,2880,3258,4564,5825,6079,6999],"values":[0.6460382945576578,3.2785010273469735,2.1367141713444147,1.1966138720291084,3.4960351200691706,1.162015545335049,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.3711311285073675,1.604729392502474,1.7139899308309823,3.4244306149452273,1.8818517047392527,4.045224089013853,2.0064197866819473,2.127032521151058,1.9469506069506084,2.1521782565202803,2.3212364753796515,2.317169775997098,2.5001408943598484,2.51289241584188,2.8377834061292515,2.76533567167316,2.908534262247101,3.0568369721919364,3.424750734647968,3.4471119148061256,3.541919708264792,3.6016814428070463,3.900174431363043,4.058285512406398,8.280518190732142,4.528289141652134,4.8085911068062925,5.2288713006995975,11.003476574732474,5.501738287366237,5.999576715605417,6.389041482367141,13.589013180950609,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.01395999964451E-5,7.959919993856002E-5,8.021800781633324E-5,7.975450731257942E-5,7.975581400038818E-5,7.964433131067262E-5,7.98812047111941E-5,0.27767120608027557,7.97896554922716E-5,8.852226722299898E-5,0.5253761161089748,7.948215254303328E-5,8.096564750528211E-5,0.14350884521933058,7.954011009951781E-5,7.932029555352887E-5,8.129884110456313E-5,7.988868897710691E-5,7.96408346307662E-5,7.970684272277581E-5,8.047805317512184E-5,7.9967838452249E-5,8.0058893967962E-5,8.01451484468779E-5,8.076022128688649E-5,8.033786806529834E-5,8.371511941924628E-5,7.950578185821534E-5,7.950790882407285E-5,7.970934166146017E-5,8.140354505831565E-5,7.988406010977121E-5,0.0473490055745866,8.010876218264157E-5,7.95923203262991E-5,7.995969135240273E-5,7.951256683233462E-5,7.955955290922028E-5,7.93198970419507E-5,7.934047628273037E-5,7.95190620523565E-5,8.035781966098236E-5,7.99494878103871E-5,7.96333898845869E-5,8.060101907239332E-5,7.966395361477924E-5,8.231079119763733E-5,8.110038702085675E-5,7.936019672846742E-5,7.953558761644644E-5,7.950800167814422E-5,8.174565571930067E-5,7.953677095436233E-5,7.933343266145338E-5,8.020423061980187E-5,7.955725751514195E-5,8.555508688877439E-5,7.949169199748102E-5,7.935927897331976E-5,7.973819623846942E-5,8.052913213001656E-5,7.973292110322988E-5,7.934459732929215E-5,7.95293390719685E-5,7.932085643014632E-5,8.115617664028872E-5,8.000416837344813E-5,7.983374778117164E-5,7.976392956061268E-5,8.005468176305743E-5,7.931796267950492E-5,7.97656017740309E-5,8.105934688284134E-5,7.946010487441524E-5,8.142670106871616E-5,7.967018931896986E-5,8.029372816969832E-5,7.980300822554287E-5,7.929309416210707E-5,7.939138339821685E-5]}}
{"value":"This unpleasant film has little to recommend it. Dolph Lundgren gives a performance that is better than either this script or his other action films have allowed. And there are occasional snippets of dialog that suggest the film might have been able to provide some insight into a bizarre subculture.<br /><br />But no. Motivations are either murky or trite. Most of the acting is sub-par. The script creates needless confusion. And the director's needless fascination with focusing on gore is distracting.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine who the audience is for this film.","finished_norm":["thi","unpleas","film","have","littl","to","recommend","it","dolph","lundgren","give","a","perform","that","be","well","than","either","thi","script","or","hi","other","action","film","have","allow","and","there","be","occasion","snippet","of","dialog","that","suggest","the","film","mai","have","be","abl","to","provid","some","insight","into","a","bizarr","subculturebr","br","but","no","motiv","be","either","murki","or","trite","much","of","the","act","be","subpar","the","script","creat","needless","confus","and","the","director","needless","fascin","with","focu","on","gore","be","distractingbr","br","it","hard","to","imagin","who","the","audienc","be","for","thi","film"],"filtered":["thi","unpleas","film","littl","recommend","dolph","lundgren","give","perform","well","either","thi","script","hi","action","film","allow","occasion","snippet","dialog","suggest","film","mai","abl","provid","insight","bizarr","subculturebr","br","motiv","either","murki","trite","much","act","subpar","script","creat","needless","confus","director","needless","fascin","focu","gore","distractingbr","br","hard","imagin","audienc","thi","film"],"filtered2":["unpleas","littl","recommend","dolph","lundgren","give","perform","well","either","script","action","allow","occasion","snippet","dialog","suggest","mai","abl","provid","insight","bizarr","subculturebr","motiv","either","murki","trite","act","subpar","script","creat","needless","confus","director","needless","fascin","focu","gore","distractingbr","hard","imagin","audienc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[14,20,21,30,46,58,77,105,129,168,171,207,298,340,358,362,427,432,454,521,619,646,694,825,902,1099,1258,1577,1753,2205,2318,2351,2617,2806,4094,6514],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[14,20,21,30,46,58,77,105,129,168,171,207,298,340,358,362,427,432,454,521,619,646,694,825,902,1099,1258,1577,1753,2205,2318,2351,2617,2806,4094,6514],"values":[1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3364419891718522,1.655771293751733,1.865701314626681,3.8927804517536475,2.1765612129984904,2.4106958340079214,2.4894767118610357,2.373087554090762,5.1063596758091165,2.7819920465008363,2.948928684455311,3.2030824725120812,3.058539100262467,3.233054746047873,3.235085203598255,3.2556198060399626,3.4076979462652486,3.5929222627171646,3.5900195030592035,3.6715125373103863,3.850067611308864,3.9201351739255808,4.135246553542527,4.34596758485818,4.613282354485526,4.715065048795469,10.153710186801943,6.255510089742618,5.102830579804232,5.2288713006995975,5.878215858601149,6.032366538428407,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.189472460050061E-5,0.18992919997295712,9.19846335221257E-5,9.145314532968975E-5,9.145464368651123E-5,9.132680837076734E-5,9.159842709493204E-5,9.128820000108396E-5,9.149344915318233E-5,0.12364711519565372,0.6478578543256313,9.114084071945728E-5,9.284193931500971E-5,9.416634998005735E-5,9.120729966973779E-5,9.095524204569506E-5,9.322400678285255E-5,9.160700917613692E-5,9.132279878702806E-5,9.139848915030537E-5,9.228282313912625E-5,9.169776854130442E-5,9.180218036192963E-5,9.190108691481844E-5,9.260638054299156E-5,9.212207524344305E-5,9.599471228045698E-5,9.116793605573611E-5,9.117037501152975E-5,9.140135464105154E-5,9.33440690366584E-5,9.16017013322115E-5,9.832666664235996E-5,9.185936340070822E-5,9.126716825420303E-5,9.168842639963292E-5,9.117571627086245E-5,9.122959441095372E-5,9.0954785079205E-5,9.097838294672644E-5,9.118316422986347E-5,9.214495340094327E-5,9.16767261704888E-5,9.131426202243358E-5,9.242382605485725E-5,9.134930893518224E-5,9.438439284812652E-5,9.299644283982249E-5,9.100099604848992E-5,9.120211381484992E-5,9.117048148572372E-5,9.373636154841921E-5,9.12034707284344E-5,9.09703061452766E-5,9.196883544375902E-5,9.122696232136647E-5,9.810457187413681E-5,9.115177945061333E-5,9.099994367417622E-5,9.143444169673746E-5,9.234139451324266E-5,9.14283927883315E-5,9.098310848115482E-5,9.119494871452524E-5,9.0955885193431E-5,9.30604158533326E-5,9.173942744780635E-5,9.154400903550833E-5,9.146394966223161E-5,9.179735029777054E-5,9.095256697848775E-5,9.146586716109044E-5,9.294938280732095E-5,9.111555903055657E-5,9.337062164234515E-5,9.135645931176652E-5,0.031578067683763145,9.150876050670394E-5,9.092405066997611E-5,9.103675727549825E-5]}}
{"value":"I knew this film was supposed to be so bad it was funny, so I went into it with that expectation. I just found it to be so bad it was murderously boring. The whiny theme song is funny for about 10 seconds, until you realize there is nothing clever about it except its intentionally irritating quality. Seeing things get splattered with tomatoes gets old in about 30 seconds. There is just nothing clever or funny about the film except for the premise. It could sustain a 3-4 minute comedy sketch maybe, but this is just not a feature film by any stretch of the imagination.","finished_norm":["i","know","thi","film","be","suppos","to","be","so","bad","it","be","funni","so","i","go","into","it","with","that","expect","i","just","find","it","to","be","so","bad","it","be","murder","bore","the","whini","theme","song","be","funni","for","about","second","until","you","realiz","there","be","noth","clever","about","it","except","it","intention","irrit","qualiti","see","thing","get","splatter","with","tomato","get","old","in","about","second","there","be","just","noth","clever","or","funni","about","the","film","except","for","the","premis","it","can","sustain","a","minut","comedi","sketch","mayb","but","thi","be","just","not","a","featur","film","by","ani","stretch","of","the","imagin"],"filtered":["know","thi","film","suppos","bad","funni","go","expect","find","bad","murder","bore","whini","theme","song","funni","second","realiz","noth","clever","except","intention","irrit","qualiti","see","thing","get","splatter","tomato","get","old","second","noth","clever","funni","film","except","premis","sustain","minut","comedi","sketch","mayb","thi","featur","film","ani","stretch","imagin"],"filtered2":["know","suppos","bad","funni","go","expect","find","bad","murder","bore","whini","theme","song","funni","second","realiz","noth","clever","except","intention","irrit","qualiti","see","thing","get","splatter","tomato","get","old","second","noth","clever","funni","except","premis","sustain","minut","comedi","sketch","mayb","featur","ani","stretch","imagin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,9,26,27,29,38,49,59,62,67,108,127,130,149,163,233,273,305,319,328,340,405,484,533,947,955,959,1220,2035,2394,2620,3211,3319,3930],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,9,26,27,29,38,49,59,62,67,108,127,130,149,163,233,273,305,319,328,340,405,484,533,947,955,959,1220,2035,2394,2620,3211,3319,3930],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,2.1367141713444147,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.519311641348122,3.3840606616174704,1.8693254449200722,6.06783613352078,1.9570915389266579,2.138507503627933,2.4359679371086367,2.2642139034199635,2.3253197803590226,2.4000574358028657,5.220555595469753,2.9674191958529437,2.8612813773965557,2.9056060024680126,3.1550424959247185,2.948928684455311,3.109204957709252,3.291526514503207,3.4933926673701317,7.982292419137539,8.034927035772286,3.969732115064953,4.30366520516749,5.672363804397,5.290429193699031,5.408212229355414,5.482320201509136,5.583416318380505,5.822646007446338]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.954070463346148E-5,9.886947839140099E-5,9.963809430898751E-5,9.906238433859001E-5,9.906400736422562E-5,9.892553567870169E-5,9.921975408256042E-5,9.888371495025683E-5,9.910604158885454E-5,1.0995274315718772E-4,0.8650503614429403,0.07137979189970506,1.0056673110594198E-4,1.0200133762330235E-4,9.879608341294839E-5,9.852305366489132E-5,1.0098058799633405E-4,9.922905022457584E-5,9.892119248280629E-5,9.9003180563486E-5,9.996109440197059E-5,9.932736110368381E-5,9.944046037289951E-5,9.954759631579743E-5,1.003115729752526E-4,9.978697168846104E-5,1.0398182641086049E-4,9.875344460107229E-5,9.875608648698384E-5,9.900628447363139E-5,1.0111063987249636E-4,9.922330074845828E-5,1.0650780797689733E-4,9.950240125141946E-5,9.886093328446153E-5,9.931724166136751E-5,9.876187215879383E-5,9.882023315886581E-5,9.852255867710378E-5,9.854811997424181E-5,9.876993981545491E-5,9.98117533930495E-5,9.930456793000325E-5,9.891194542791037E-5,1.0011382928036817E-4,9.894990837306742E-5,1.022375224622282E-4,1.0073408989389284E-4,9.857261456947859E-5,9.879046607580624E-5,9.875620182022348E-5,1.0153557256817464E-4,9.879193588960581E-5,9.853937115312073E-5,9.96209817722308E-5,9.881738206971666E-5,1.0626723410477958E-4,9.873594370681096E-5,9.857147463374041E-5,9.904212449438926E-5,1.0002453913044923E-4,9.903557229449303E-5,9.855323869056439E-5,9.878270481270667E-5,9.852375032489108E-5,1.0080338569808624E-4,9.937248618486217E-5,9.916080823987609E-5,9.907408763145027E-5,9.94352284295871E-5,9.852015602222559E-5,9.90761646732867E-5,0.055891529036447354,9.869670961420941E-5,1.0113940175291339E-4,9.895765368735707E-5,9.973214590556884E-5,9.912262690346384E-5,9.848926705166568E-5,9.86113512624764E-5]}}
