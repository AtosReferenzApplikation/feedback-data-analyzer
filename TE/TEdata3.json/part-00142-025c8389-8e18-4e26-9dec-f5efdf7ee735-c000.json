{"value":"I love Jamie Foxx.<br /><br />And I enjoy 99% of all movies I see.<br /><br />And I walked out of this one.<br /><br />Now, I admit, it may have had something to do with the two middle-aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing (\"Oh no, Jamie's knocking on a door! HEE HEE HEE!\"), but... this was just so incredibly annoying. There could be no sustained camera shot, and no camera shot from a conventional angle... everything had to be in-your-face, loud, and annoying.<br /><br />The bad guy tried to be smooth and Malkovich-like, but at this point, it's just old and tired. He brought nothing new or interesting. From all the characters, too many lines you saw coming, too many you've heard before, and too many \"tough guy\" lines... and I don't mind that sort of thing, really, as long as there's a bit of originality to it. In fact, pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked.<br /><br />I love Jamie Foxx, and I think he's really funny, and I thought he was funny in this movie... but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else. <br /><br />This movie needed less shoot-em-up, less annoying camera shots, more emotion, more feeling, and more Jamie Foxx.

{"value":"I watched this movie when I was a young lad full of raging hormones and it was about as sexy a movie as I had ever seen-or ever was to see. It may not have been a great movie. My guess is it wasn't. I don't really remember much about it, to tell you the truth. I only remember the sexual chemistry between Crosby and Biehn. No woman in ANY movie has ever done it for me as the unbelievably sexy Cathy did in this movie. I haven't seen it since that first time I caught it on TV in the 70s and I don't think I'd want to see it again since I'm sure it would be a disappointment-my hormones aren't as raging and I've become more jaded over the years. Still, when I think back on the shower scene I can still remember how great it felt way back when.<br /><br />Added later: After watching the movie again, I discovered that it's dangerous to go home again. What was once erotic is now pretty tame. The older woman-younger man thing still works for me, just not as much as it once did, probably because I'm no longer a 12-year-old.

{"value":"This movie is about a female rape victim/comic book writer from New York that decides to get away from all that awful big city glamor and move to a dirty, run down small town where she finds refuge in a single-wide trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of 12th and nowhere. The townspeople are mentally ill, yet so is she for inviting crazy men into her trailer. Annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to place herself in dangerous circumstance after dangerous circumstance. DB Sweeney's performance was high school at best. He's one of those kinda-cute young actors with a sweet grin. Unfortunately career has not been kind and mother nature has been right in tow. To the previous commentator stating that the acting was \"so real\", well I agree. Actually it wasn't acting. The two main characters really are pathetic, weak and incapable of making mature, healthy decisions. In brief, this movie sucks like no other, rent it to laugh at it. The real crime scene? The atrocious Wood paneling in the trailer - enough to make ME commit murder.

{"value":"This so called remake is terrible. I went to see this tonight.. on the first day as the anticipation and hype was too much for me to handle. But within the first half an hour, we knew that this is a disaster. It not only does not match the hype created but also insults the original blockbuster. The script had loopholes, the editing was untidy quite a few times. Mohanlal who is an excellent actor did an okay job. Amitabh was alright.. the director wanted to portray how evil his character is but he went a bit overboard which resulted in it being forceful. Ajay who is especially smooth in these kind of roles was also a disappointment. Lets not even get started about the new guy Prashant.. one wouldn't be proud to start off a career with something like this. Rajpal Yadav who was thrown in for a few laughs couldn't even get a smile out of anyone because of his forceful humor and the shrill voice. Nisha Kothari proved that she is one of the worst actresses we have today. All in all, RGV who I thought was one of the most talented and gifted directors India has had.. failed miserably. He took up such a huge challenge and responsibility to remake what is known as the best Hindi movie ever and made a mess out of it.","finished_norm":["thi","so","call","remak","be","terribl","i","go","to","see","thi","tonight","on","the","dai","a","the","anticip","and","hyp","be","too","much","for","me","to","handl","but","within","the","half","a","hour","we","know","that","thi","be","a","disast","it","not","onli","doe","not","match","the","hyp","creat","but","conjur","insult","the","origin","blockbust","the","script","have","loophol","the","edit","be","untidi","quit","a","few","time","mohanl","who","be","a","excel","actor","do","a","okai","job","amitabh","be","alright","the","director","want","to","portrai","how","evil","hi","charact","be","but","he","go","a","bite","overboard","which","result","in","it","be","forc","ajai","who","be","especi","smooth","in","thi","kind","of","role","be","conjur","a","disappoint","let","not","even","get","start","about","the","new","gui","prashant","on","would","not","be","proud","to","start","off","a","career","with","someth","like","thi","rajpal","yadav","who","be","throw","in","for","a","few","laugh","can","not","even","get","a","smile","out","of","anyon","becaus","of","hi","forc","humor","and","the","shrill","voic","nisha","kothari","prove","that","she","be","on","of","the","wrong","actress","we","have","todai","all","in","all","rgv","who","i","think","be","on","of","the","much","talent","and","gift","director","india","have","have","fail","miser","he","take","up","such","a","huge","challeng","and","respons","to","remak","what","be","know","a","the","well","hindi","movi","ever","and","make","a","mess","out","of","it"],"filtered":["thi","call","remak","terribl","go","see","thi","tonight","dai","anticip","hyp","much","handl","within","half","hour","know","thi","disast","onli","doe","match","hyp","creat","conjur","insult","origin","blockbust","script","loophol","edit","untidi","quit","time","mohanl","excel","actor","okai","job","amitabh","alright","director","want","portrai","evil","hi","charact","go","bite","overboard","result","forc","ajai","especi","smooth","thi","kind","role","conjur","disappoint","let","even","get","start","new","gui","prashant","proud","start","career","someth","like","thi","rajpal","yadav","throw","laugh","even","get","smile","anyon","becaus","hi","forc","humor","shrill","voic","nisha","kothari","prove","wrong","actress","todai","rgv","think","much","talent","gift","director","india","fail","miser","take","huge","challeng","respons","remak","know","well","hindi","movi","ever","make","mess"],"filtered2":["call","remak","terribl","go","see","tonight","dai","anticip","hyp","handl","within","half","hour","know","disast","onli","doe","match","hyp","creat","conjur","insult","origin","blockbust","script","loophol","edit","untidi","quit","time","mohanl","excel","actor","okai","job","amitabh","alright","director","want","portrai","evil","charact","go","bite","overboard","result","forc","ajai","especi","smooth","kind","role","conjur","disappoint","let","even","get","start","new","gui","prashant","proud","start","career","someth","like","rajpal","yadav","throw","laugh","even","get","smile","anyon","becaus","forc","humor","shrill","voic","nisha","kothari","prove","wrong","actress","todai","rgv","think","talent","gift","director","india","fail","miser","take","huge","challeng","respons","remak","know","well","hindi","ever","make","mess"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,8,10,11,12,18,20,22,25,26,31,37,39,41,44,53,55,58,69,71,77,87,120,122,124,128,132,133,142,154,158,166,174,187,191,206,215,267,276,289,310,321,338,348,355,362,369,407,428,444,447,469,483,511,540,580,672,709,789,915,919,945,1034,1301,1330,1462,1551,1589,1680,2133,2270,2667,2991,3087,3516,3658,4030,4301,4569,4832,6541,6824,7271],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,8,10,11,12,18,20,22,25,26,31,37,39,41,44,53,55,58,69,71,77,87,120,122,124,128,132,133,142,154,158,166,174,187,191,206,215,267,276,289,310,321,338,348,355,362,369,407,428,444,447,469,483,511,540,580,672,709,789,915,919,945,1034,1301,1330,1462,1551,1589,1680,2133,2270,2667,2991,3087,3516,3658,4030,4301,4569,4832,6541,6824,7271],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,1.852034211452262,1.9416538289407692,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,3.1077880109725475,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.7003182735607676,1.9536997889255368,3.731402629253362,2.127032521151058,3.8429853485101932,1.9463902258768238,2.115024371522662,2.2044500422972613,2.24893476737

{"value":"When you have two tower house of performers pitched against each other, the least you can expect is the superb camaraderie and that is the case in this film where we have a 64 yrs old Amitabh Bachchan romances a 34-yr old Tabu. Wait! In fact that is all there in the name of plot therefore instead of \"cheeni\" it is the content that is \"Kum\" in this Adman turned Writer-Director R. Balki's maiden effort..<br /><br />Trust the two senior actors to bring the house down with their wise-cracks and bitter-sweet moments when love happened in this unconventional pair, and that is all you find in slow but refreshing first half. The locales of London as captured in rainy season are captivating. By the end of first half, romance completed and mission accomplished. There is not much left to be said. Therefore in the second half a strange opposition comes in the form of girl's father to the extent that he goes for a Satyagrah is really a test of patience. There is an equally strange climax about how he gives in. The result, second half is dry, flat with no energy. There is a subplot with a girl child dying of cancer, not making much impact. Nonetheless, the film is recommended for its fresh approach and the performances.","finished_norm":["when","you","have","two","tower","hous","of","perform","pitch","against","each","other","the","littl","you","can","expect","be","the","superb","camaraderi","and","that","be","the","case","in","thi","film","where","we","have","a","yr","old","amitabh","bachchan","romanc","a","yr","old","tabu","wait","in","fact","that","be","all","there","in","the","name","of","plot","therefor","instead","of","cheeni","it","be","the","content","that","be","kum","in","thi","adman","turn","writerdirector","r","balki","maiden","effortbr","br","trust","the","two","senior","actor","to","bring","the","hous","down","with","their","wisecrack","and","bittersweet","moment","when","love","happen","in","thi","unconvent","pair","and","that","be","all","you","find","in","slow","but","refresh","half","the","local","of","london","a","captur","in","raini","season","be","captiv","by","the","end","of","half","romanc","complet","and","mission","accomplish","there","be","not","much","leav","to","be","sai","therefor","in","the","half","a","strang","opposit","come","in","the","form","of","girl","father","to","the","extent","that","he","go","for","a","satyagrah","be","realli","a","test","of","patienc","there","be","a","equal","strang","climax","about","how","he","give","in","the","result","half","be","spindri","flat","with","no","energi","there","be","a","subplot","with","a","girl","child","dye","of","cancer","not","make","much","impact","nonetheless","the","film","be","recommend","for","it","fresh","approach","and","the","perform"],"filtered":["two","tower","hous","perform","pitch","littl","expect","superb","camaraderi","case","thi","film","yr","old","amitabh","bachchan","romanc","yr","old","tabu","wait","fact","name","plot","therefor","instead","cheeni","content","kum","thi","adman","turn","writerdirector","r","balki","maiden","effortbr","br","trust","two","senior","actor","bring","hous","wisecrack","bittersweet","moment","love","happen","thi","unconvent","pair","find","slow","refresh","half","local","london","captur","raini","season","captiv","end","half","romanc","complet","mission","accomplish","much","leav","sai","therefor","half","strang","opposit","come","form","girl","father","extent","go","satyagrah","realli","test","patienc","equal","strang","climax","give","result","half","spindri","flat","energi","subplot","girl","child","dye","cancer","make","much","impact","nonetheless","film","recommend","fresh","approach","perform"],"filtered2":["two","tower","hous","perform","pitch","littl","expect","superb","camaraderi","case","yr","old","amitabh","bachchan","romanc","yr","old","tabu","wait","fact","name","plot","therefor","instead","cheeni","content","kum","adman","turn","writerdirector","r","balki","maiden","effortbr","trust","two","senior","actor","bring","hous","wisecrack","bittersweet","moment","love","happen","unconvent","pair","find","slow","refresh","half","local","london","captur","raini","season","captiv","end","half","romanc","complet","mission","accomplish","leav","therefor","half","strang","opposit","come","form","girl","father","extent","go","satyagrah","realli","test","patienc","equal","strang","climax","give","result","half","spindri","flat","energi","subplot","girl","child","dye","cancer","make","impact","nonetheless","recommend","fresh","approach","perform"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,13,14,24,30,32,34,38,41,47,54,67,74,84,94,96,97,103,105,130,143,152,180,188,206,213,250,288,298,331,343,390,417,447,475,593,689,817,892,906,925,1078,1092,1136,1142,1229,1230,1290,1306,1374,1408,1442,1447,1602,1643,1652,1661,1795,1968,2000,2184,2186,2353,2680,2880,3087,3276,3452,3475,3787,4335,4338,4503,5191,5658,6126,7206,7584],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,13,14,24,30,32,34,38,41,47,54,67,74,84,94,96,97,103,105,130,143,152,180,188,206,213,250,288,298,331,343,390,417,447,475,593,689,817,892,906,925,1078,1092,1136,1142,1229,1230,1290,1306,1374,1408,1442,1447,1602,1643,1652,1661,1795,1968,2000,2184,2186,2353,2680,2880,3087,3276,3452,3475,3787,4335,4338,4503,5191,5658,6126,7206,7584],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9708269144703846,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,3.412938870621443,1.8113893252729412,3.9141830778533158,1.9486336368009016,4.442538903180445,2.08112281984698,2.0390708128715254,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,4.353122425996981,2.2642139034199635,2.3409902041158843,2.3131195476980753,2.7097314792693545,2.5378812223426954,10.389218571253984,5.6865257437877545,2.6812935439488212,2.8015621426949333,2.7819920465008363,2.9322742495

{"value":"In the first Howling, we are introduced to a world where werewolves exist and are somewhat organized. The plot in that film made some sense; a TV reporter investigates this and attempts to uncover the truth. She ends up having to kill many of them including her boyfriend who becomes one. Then she shows the world that they do exist by transforming on live TV. The special effects were just laughable in the first movie and they don't get any better in this one. Whether it's the transformations or the bad puppets or the cheesy computer graphics showing the superpowers.<br /><br />The plot line isn't all that bad; they must kill the leader of the werewolves for some reason. This won't destroy all werewolves and it really doesn't end the threat from werewolves as it...they just want to kill her. I think there was some cloudy reason for this but it really gets lost in the film.<br /><br />After the film \"ends\" we have a 10 minute montauge of the movie we just watched and every other scene is one where the female werewolf leader rips off her top exposing her large breasts while some Devo-esquire band plays to a crowd of werewolves. <br /><br />The only thing that makes this movie even

{"value":"I saw this for free, thankfully, and wish it was better than it was, but it's really the same old stuff that movie studios seem to foist on us in the last ten years.<br /><br />Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston play a couple who are opposites- and yet they are attracted to each other.<br /><br />If that plot line doesn't take you by surprise and thrill you, the movie won't either.<br /><br />Lots of sight gags and fart jokes. Halfway through the movie I began to realize that Ben Stiller really isn't that funny, but he tries VERY hard. And Jennifer Anniston really isn't that pretty, but her HAIR looks great. And Hank Azaria and Phillip Seymore Hoffman must have got paid a great deal of money to be in this kind of average ho-hum movie, I've come to expect more from them.<br /><br />What was interesting was that I saw this after I saw American Splendor, which is a truly funny and original movie- and I compared the two in my head, and found myself wishing that the movie executives would be forced to sit

{"value":"I'm not sure why Spike Lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor Stevie Wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess. I also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional Blacks. The abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame. Scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes, play as if some college kid wrote this. I especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up Snipes. The overacting of the leads makes one feel as if Spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about. The final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in. This movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the F-word in casual conversation. I am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker. I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move.

{"value":"I picked up TRAN SCAN from the library and brought it home. We have considered taking a trip out east and thought it would give us a feel of what it was like. The film was a total waste of time, if I went out to buy it I would call it TRAN SCAM when I saw that it costs $49.<br /><br />The DVD ran for 8 minutes and showed a roller coaster ride across Canada with my stomach feeling ill as they went up and down and around curve with the film at high speed.<br /><br />There was a lot of footage they probably shot on this and you would think that they could have made a better product. If I would of done this project I would of provided more footage, paused on road signs to let people know where they were and linger in places to view the scenery. To make a film like this it should of been 60 to 90min. Oh yes the case said it was in stereo, the whole film was a hissing sound from sped up car sound, thet could of at least put some music to it.<br /><br />If you want a good cross Canada film watch The

{"value":"During the early 1980's, Kurt Thomas was something of a hero in the United States. Inevitably, men in his position get offered film roles that exist solely to capitalize on that. I have no idea what Thomas was paid to make this film, but I would have to be paid a big heap of money to agree to make a national fool of myself in a motion picture. The film is obviously derived from \"Enter The Dragon,\" as are most martial arts pictures. Only instead of a real martial art, they concoct an absurd new martial art, accurately described by one critic as \"a cross between Kung Fu and break dancing.\" A gymnast (Thomas, of course) is hired to rescue some lady from an impenetrable fortress, yet every room has a prop that is exactly what Thomas needs to kick the assistant baddies. Of course, he fights his way to the lead villain, and of course they have a fancy-dancy fight, with an ending that will surprise only those who have never seen a marshal arts film. There are touches which nostalgic types will like, particularly the mullet haircuts of Thomas and many of the male co-stars have. But the only reason to watch this film is if you have a grudge against Kurt Thomas, who now wishes he had never set foot on the film set.","finished_norm":["dure","the","earli","kurt","thoma","be","someth","of","a","hero","in","the","unit","state","inevit","man","in","hi","posit","get","offer","film","role","that","exist","sole","to","capit","on","that","i","have","no","idea","what","thoma","be","pai","to","make","thi","film","but","i","would","have","to","be","pai","a","big","heap","of","monei","to","agre","to","make","a","nation","fool","of","myself","in","a","motion","pictur","the","film","be","obvious","deriv","from","enter","the","dragon","a","be","much","martial","art","pictur","onli","instead","of","a","real","martial","art","thei","concoct","a","absurd","new","martial","art","accur","describ","by","on","critic","a","a","cross","between","kung","fu","and","break","danc","a","gymnast","thoma","of","cours","be","hire","to","rescu","some","ladi","from","a","impenetr","fortress","yet","everi","room","have","a","prop","that","be","exactli","what","thoma","ne","to","kick","the","assist","baddi","of","cours","he","fight","hi","wai","to","the","lead","villain","and","of","cours","thei","have","a","fancyd","fight","with","a","end","that","will","surpris","onli","that","who","have","never","see","a","marshal","art","film","there","be","touch","which","nostalg","typ","will","like","particularli","the","mullet","haircut","of","thoma","and","mani","of","the","male","costar","have","but","the","onli","reason","to","watch","thi","film","be","if","you","have","a","grudg","against","kurt","thoma","who","now","wish","he","have","never","set","foot","on","the","film","set"],"filtered":["dure","earli","kurt","thoma","someth","hero","unit","state","inevit","man","hi","posit","get","offer","film","role","exist","sole","capit","idea","thoma","pai","make","thi","film","pai","big","heap","monei","agre","make","nation","fool","motion","pictur","film","obvious","deriv","enter","dragon","much","martial","art","pictur","onli","instead","real","martial","art","thei","concoct","absurd","new","martial","art","accur","describ","critic","cross","kung","fu","break","danc","gymnast","thoma","cours","hire","rescu","ladi","impenetr","fortress","yet","everi","room","prop","exactli","thoma","ne","kick","assist","baddi","cours","fight","hi","wai","lead","villain","cours","thei","fancyd","fight","end","surpris","onli","never","see","marshal","art","film","touch","nostalg","typ","like","particularli","mullet","haircut","thoma","mani","male","costar","onli","reason","watch","thi","film","grudg","kurt","thoma","wish","never","set","foot","film","set"],"filtered2":["dure","earli","kurt","thoma","someth","hero","unit","state","inevit","man","posit","get","offer","role","exist","sole","capit","idea","thoma","pai","make","pai","big","heap","monei","agre","make","nation","fool","motion","pictur","obvious","deriv","enter","dragon","martial","art","pictur","onli","instead","real","martial","art","concoct","absurd","new","martial","art","accur","describ","critic","cross","kung","fu","break","danc","gymnast","thoma","cours","hire","rescu","ladi","impenetr","fortress","yet","everi","room","prop","exactli","thoma","ne","kick","assist","baddi","cours","fight","wai","lead","villain","cours","fancyd","fight","end","surpris","onli","never","see","marshal","art","touch","nostalg","typ","like","particularli","mullet","haircut","thoma","mani","male","costar","onli","reason","watch","grudg","kurt","thoma","wish","never","set","foot","set"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,11,24,33,42,45,50,53,80,82,85,87,95,109,110,123,126,128,152,157,194,199,233,239,266,311,322,326,341,360,375,382,384,399,462,472,492,497,498,507,509,513,520,528,579,622,649,668,745,869,928,981,1014,1021,1055,1057,1170,1190,1254,1386,1467,1477,1481,1601,1621,1946,2056,2123,2252,2379,2432,2462,3166,3440,3448,3485,3525,3535,4056,4278,4978,5860,5912],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,11,24,33,42,45,50,53,80,82,85,87,95,109,110,123,126,128,152,157,194,199,233,239,266,311,322,326,341,360,375,382,384,399,462,472,492,497,498,507,509,513,520,528,579,622,649,668,745,869,928,981,1014,1021,1055,1057,1170,1190,1254,1386,1467,1477,1481,1601,1621,1946,2056,2123,2252,2379,2432,2462,3166,3440,3448,3485,3525,3535,4056,4278,4978,5860,5912],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,2.9739294460164585,1.3210361566119257,1.4018535447685214,3.2439908614907673,1.8162961064622165,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,1.9951803900462557,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.115024371522662,2.0323326556775485,4.251382278653714,2.1290479736304078,2.2619070973220485,2.2391270689902285,2.34099020411

{"value":"If ever there was a film that deserved a big fat zero rating it's this pile of crap. I love zombie films and even bad ones usually have something going for them but not this atrocity. I actually began to feel angry watching this film because it's so insultingly poor, I can't believe the people responsible for it would actually think this was acceptable.<br /><br />There's no plot and the non-plot is cut with scenes of sadism and spanking. The people don't react, act or in any way resemble human beings. The entire movie is also shot in two rooms scantily decorated to vaguely resemble the places they are supposed to be. The whole thing is one pointless mess, it doesn't go anywhere and when the zombies finally turn up they look rubbish and don't do very much.<br /><br />I could make a better film than this, so could you and so could someone who had never seen a movie before. It's pitiful and without doubt the worst movie of all time.<br /><br />Honestly, the very worst movie of all time. You'll note by the way that the only positive reviews give this a 10/10 and urge you to BUY the DVD. I can't imagine anyone neutral genuinely thinking this is a good film, it's terrible.<br /><br />0/10 and that's generous.","finished_norm":["if","ever","there","be","a","film","that","deserv","a","big","fat","zero","rate","it","thi","pile","of","crap","i","love","zombi","film","and","even","bad","on","usual","have","someth","go","for","them","but","not","thi","atroc","i","actual","begin","to","feel","angri","watch","thi","film","becaus","it","so","insultingli","poor","i","ca","not","believ","the","peopl","respons","for","it","would","actual","think","thi","be","acceptablebr","br","there","no","plot","and","the","nonplot","be","cut","with","scene","of","sadism","and","spank","the","peopl","do","not","react","act","or","in","ani","wai","resembl","human","be","the","entir","movi","be","conjur","shoot","in","two","room","scantili","decor","to","vagu","resembl","the","place","thei","be","suppos","to","be","the","whole","thing","be","on","pointless","mess","it","doe","not","go","anywher","and","when","the","zombi","final","turn","up","thei","look","rubbish","and","do","not","do","veri","muchbr","br","i","can","make","a","well","film","than","thi","so","can","you","and","so","can","someon","who","have","never","see","a","movi","befor","it","piti","and","without","doubt","the","wrong","movi","of","all","timebr","br","honestli","the","veri","wrong","movi","of","all","time","you","will","note","by","the","wai","that","the","onli","posit","review","give","thi","a","and","urg","you","to","bui","the","dvd","i","ca","not","imagin","anyon","neutral","genuin","think","thi","be","a","good","film","it","terriblebr","br","and","that","gener"],"filtered":["ever","film","deserv","big","fat","zero","rate","thi","pile","crap","love","zombi","film","even","bad","usual","someth","go","thi","atroc","actual","begin","feel","angri","watch","thi","film","becaus","insultingli","poor","ca","believ","peopl","respons","actual","think","thi","acceptablebr","br","plot","nonplot","cut","scene","sadism","spank","peopl","react","act","ani","wai","resembl","human","entir","movi","conjur","shoot","two","room","scantili","decor","vagu","resembl","place","thei","suppos","whole","thing","pointless","mess","doe","go","anywher","zombi","final","turn","thei","look","rubbish","veri","muchbr","br","make","well","film","thi","someon","never","see","movi","befor","piti","without","doubt","wrong","movi","timebr","br","honestli","veri","wrong","movi","time","note","wai","onli","posit","review","give","thi","urg","bui","dvd","ca","imagin","anyon","neutral","genuin","think","thi","good","film","terriblebr","br","gener"],"filtered2":["ever","deserv","big","fat","zero","rate","pile","crap","love","zombi","even","bad","usual","someth","go","atroc","actual","begin","feel","angri","watch","becaus","insultingli","poor","ca","believ","peopl","respons","actual","think","acceptablebr","plot","nonplot","cut","scene","sadism","spank","peopl","react","act","ani","wai","resembl","human","entir","conjur","shoot","two","room","scantili","decor","vagu","resembl","place","suppos","whole","thing","pointless","mess","doe","go","anywher","zombi","final","turn","look","rubbish","veri","muchbr","make","well","someon","never","see","befor","piti","without","doubt","wrong","timebr","honestli","veri","wrong","time","note","wai","onli","posit","review","give","urg","bui","dvd","ca","imagin","anyon","neutral","genuin","think","good","terriblebr","gener"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,25,27,29,30,32,33,39,42,43,44,47,52,53,54,79,81,82,91,96,111,117,125,139,146,147,149,156,158,164,176,198,202,225,247,265,268,292,303,313,340,347,407,423,509,513,531,560,567,757,915,964,1053,1098,1133,1151,1161,1166,1250,1266,1292,1508,2476,2605,3095,3481,4001,4654,6278,6374,7370,7948],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,25,27,29,30,32,33,39,42,43,44,47,52,53,54,79,81,82,91,96,111,117,125,139,146,147,149,156,158,164,176,198,202,225,247,265,268,292,303,313,340,347,407,423,509,513,531,560,567,757,915,964,1053,1098,1133,1151,1161,1166,1250,1266,1292,1508,2476,2605,3095,3481,4001,4654,6278,6374,7370,7948],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,2.803707089537043,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.7064694353107215

{"value":"Given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness (81 minutes - including end credits, so roughly 76 minutes of actual film). But what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed.<br /><br />The gags are quick and sometimes not even funny. The only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the Nike basketball spots, James Woods' portrayal of Max Van Sydow's character in the Exorcist, and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film. Very unfunny was the take off of Charlie's Angels, which like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin off scene, basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it.<br /><br />Today's youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70's such as the Exorcist and maybe of the 80s' Poltergeist, et. al.<br /><br />Hopefully Scary Movie 3 will take some time to put together, making the spoofs more enjoyable.<br /><br />One thing though, the film features more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris (whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel). Just for her casting and acting ability, I give this movie a \"3\" out of \"10\".","finished_norm":["give","that","thi","movi","be","put","togeth","in","littl","than","a","year","mai","explain","it","short","minut","includ","end","credit","so","roughli","minut","of","actual","film","but","what","it","cannot","explain","be","it","lack","of","humor","that","the","previou","film","possessedbr","br","the","gag","be","quick","and","sometim","not","even","funni","the","onli","true","funni","part","be","the","quick","spoof","on","the","nike","basketbal","spot","jame","wood","portray","of","max","van","sydow","charact","in","the","exorcist","and","bit","and","piec","scatter","throughout","the","film","veri","unfunni","be","the","take","off","of","charli","angel","which","like","the","scari","movi","and","the","matrix","spin","off","scene","basic","recreat","the","scene","without","much","humor","inject","into","itbr","br","todai","youth","mai","not","be","abl","to","relat","to","the","spoof","gag","of","the","classic","supernatur","horror","film","of","the","such","a","the","exorcist","and","mayb","of","the","poltergeist","et","albr","br","hopefulli","scari","movi","will","take","some","time","to","put","togeth","make","the","spoof","much","enjoyablebr","br","on","thing","though","the","film","featur","much","than","the","last","on","of","promis","young","actress","anna","fari","whom","i","will","admit","seem","exception","hot","in","the","sequel","just","for","her","cast","and","act","abil","i","give","thi","movi","a","out","of"],"filtered":["give","thi","movi","put","togeth","littl","year","mai","explain","short","minut","includ","end","credit","roughli","minut","actual","film","explain","lack","humor","previou","film","possessedbr","br","gag","quick","sometim","even","funni","onli","true","funni","part","quick","spoof","nike","basketbal","spot","jame","wood","portray","max","van","sydow","charact","exorcist","bit","piec","scatter","throughout","film","veri","unfunni","take","charli","angel","like","scari","movi","matrix","spin","scene","basic","recreat","scene","without","much","humor","inject","itbr","br","todai","youth","mai","abl","relat","spoof","gag","classic","supernatur","horror","film","exorcist","mayb","poltergeist","et","albr","br","hopefulli","scari","movi","take","time","put","togeth","make","spoof","much","enjoyablebr","br","thing","though","film","featur","much","last","promis","young","actress","anna","fari","admit","seem","exception","hot","sequel","cast","act","abil","give","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["give","put","togeth","littl","year","mai","explain","short","minut","includ","end","credit","roughli","minut","actual","explain","lack","humor","previou","possessedbr","gag","quick","sometim","even","funni","onli","true","funni","part","quick","spoof","nike","basketbal","spot","jame","wood","portray","max","van","sydow","charact","exorcist","bit","piec","scatter","throughout","veri","unfunni","take","charli","angel","like","scari","matrix","spin","scene","basic","recreat","scene","without","humor","inject","itbr","todai","youth","mai","abl","relat","spoof","gag","classic","supernatur","horror","exorcist","mayb","poltergeist","et","albr","hopefulli","scari","take","time","put","togeth","make","spoof","enjoyablebr","thing","though","featur","last","promis","young","actress","anna","fari","admit","seem","exception","hot","sequel","cast","act","abil","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,8,10,11,14,15,19,21,24,29,30,31,35,46,52,57,59,61,62,83,86,92,125,135,144,159,163,183,218,270,272,286,301,304,305,332,355,356,369,387,395,396,430,438,454,500,620,655,666,683,691,784,789,818,847,903,948,998,1005,1036,1173,1382,1422,1489,1547,1640,1808,1839,1858,1915,2134,2340,2696,2756,2866,3218,3836,3999,4993,5012,7853,8404],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,8,10,11,14,15,19,21,24,29,30,31,35,46,52,57,59,61,62,83,86,92,125,135,144,159,163,183,218,270,272,286,301,304,305,332,355,356,369,387,395,396,430,438,454,500,620,655,666,683,691,784,789,818,847,903,948,998,1005,1036,1173,1382,1422,1489,1547,1640,1808,1839,1858,1915,2134,2340,2696,2756,2866,3218,3836,3999,4993,5012,7853,8404],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.62476135602347,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,2.6728839783437044,2.814133962290301,1.463169012899134,3.311542587503466,1.7122153074726136,1.834162586674748,3.7386508898401445,1.8818517047392527,4.045224089013853,2.292318797740072,2.031112399272319,2.0489535369135887,2.2242236634876535,2.366244071437088,2.2931108769894046,4.60053593038899,2.4000574358028

{"value":"Wowwwwww, about an hour ago I finally finished watching this terrible movie!!! I wanted to turn it off within the first like 10 minutes but I figured I'd give it a chance because it just hadddd to get better. Or at least have some redeeming qualities, like I figured at the very least it would be a make you think type movie, or like really intelligent, or very well filmed or something...Needless to say, that was not the case and I wasted about an hour and a half of my life. Im not even going to get into why its terrible because its a waste of my time to explain that this \"may contain spoilers\"...IMDb, you should calm down on the spoilers thing and pay more attention to making sure that the people who rate the movies and comment are not paid to write good reviews or involved somehow in the movie or anything else like that. I thought it would be humorous after this terrible film to come see hoe bad the rating would be and I was very very shocked to see the fairly high ratings...all the ratings with about 7-10 stars clearly must be about some COMPLETELY DIFFERENT movie... Im still a big IMDb fan, but seriously rethink this rating process because this movie should be rated no higher than maaaybbbeee like a 3.","finished_norm":["wowwwwww","about","a","hour","ago","i","final","finish","watch","thi","terribl","movi","i","want","to","turn","it","off","within","the","like","minut","but","i","figur","i","have","give","it","a","chanc","becaus","it","just","hadddd","to","get","well","or","at","littl","have","some","redeem","qualiti","like","i","figur","at","the","veri","littl","it","would","be","a","make","you","think","typ","movi","or","like","realli","intellig","or","veri","good","film","or","somethingneedless","to","sai","that","be","not","the","case","and","i","wast","about","a","hour","and","a","half","of","my","life","im","not","even","go","to","get","into","why","it","terribl","becaus","it","a","wast","of","my","time","to","explain","that","thi","mai","contain","spoilersimdb","you","should","calm","down","on","the","spoiler","thing","and","pai","much","attent","to","make","sure","that","the","peopl","who","rate","the","movi","and","comment","be","not","pai","to","write","good","review","or","involv","somehow","in","the","movi","or","anyth","els","like","that","i","think","it","would","be","humor","after","thi","terribl","film","to","come","see","hoe","bad","the","rate","would","be","and","i","be","veri","veri","shock","to","see","the","fairli","high","ratingsal","the","rate","with","about","star","clearli","must","be","about","some","complet","differ","movi","im","still","a","big","imdb","fan","but","serious","rethink","thi","rate","process","becaus","thi","movi","should","be","rate","no","high","than","maaaybbbee","like","a"],"filtered":["wowwwwww","hour","ago","final","finish","watch","thi","terribl","movi","want","turn","within","like","minut","figur","give","chanc","becaus","hadddd","get","well","littl","redeem","qualiti","like","figur","veri","littl","make","think","typ","movi","like","realli","intellig","veri","good","film","somethingneedless","sai","case","wast","hour","half","life","im","even","go","get","terribl","becaus","wast","time","explain","thi","mai","contain","spoilersimdb","calm","spoiler","thing","pai","much","attent","make","sure","peopl","rate","movi","comment","pai","write","good","review","involv","somehow","movi","anyth","els","like","think","humor","thi","terribl","film","come","see","hoe","bad","rate","veri","veri","shock","see","fairli","high","ratingsal","rate","star","clearli","must","complet","differ","movi","im","still","big","imdb","fan","serious","rethink","thi","rate","process","becaus","thi","movi","rate","high","maaaybbbee","like"],"filtered2":["wowwwwww","hour","ago","final","finish","watch","terribl","want","turn","within","like","minut","figur","give","chanc","becaus","hadddd","get","well","littl","redeem","qualiti","like","figur","veri","littl","make","think","typ","like","realli","intellig","veri","good","somethingneedless","case","wast","hour","half","life","im","even","go","get","terribl","becaus","wast","time","explain","mai","contain","spoilersimdb","calm","spoiler","thing","pai","attent","make","sure","peopl","rate","comment","pai","write","good","review","involv","somehow","anyth","els","like","think","humor","terribl","come","see","hoe","bad","rate","veri","veri","shock","see","fairli","high","ratingsal","rate","star","clearli","must","complet","differ","im","still","big","imdb","fan","serious","rethink","rate","process","becaus","rate","high","maaaybbbee","like"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15,20,22,23,29,30,34,37,46,59,64,65,75,82,89,96,100,103,104,119,140,141,156,166,174,176,196,202,204,206,211,241,280,288,319,322,369,371,384,395,415,486,490,494,508,549,573,591,603,610,634,636,672,711,819,1492,2346,4513],"values":[2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15,20,22,23,29,30,34,37,46,59,64,65,75,82,89,96,100,103,104,119,140,141,156,166,174,176,196,202,204,206,211,241,280,288,319,322,369,371,384,395,415,486,490,494,508,549,573,591,603,610,634,636,672,711,819,1492,2346,4513],"values":[1.2399534312410465,3.230191472788289,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,2.2350163994518417,4.800243119426277,1.165345040023057,3.893772050208532,1.364847727375781,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.655771293751733,1.8693254449200722,1.883428577602134,1.9073850067444174,1.9742250248702675,2.020196584395323,3.9880092219144876,2.0390708128715254,2.1405462403177813,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.1653408989309972,2.317169775997098,2.2657547357741192,2.3451551414151686,7.327161098908061,4.912565156919632,2.5040471493269134,2.4789250

{"value":"I'm trying to decide if jumping into a wood chopper would be more enjoyable than this dreck. It finishes the destruction of what was once a classic couple of films. With Jedi, Menace, Clowns and Sith we have the death of Lucas' career. He wants us to swallow the Annakin is Vader nonsense? I never believed it was true. This film vindicates those feelings. The story hasn't worked since Phantom Moron, and each new film just piled the crap on until all that was left was a toy parade. I have to go. I know where some new rocks to throw are. You want spoilers? Here they come. Luke and Leia are NOT related. Vader is NOT their Father. Duke Countoo should have switched sides while he still could. Yoda has less verbal skills than Yogi Berra. His advice has never been any good to anybody. Obi Wan lied to Luke for the first two films. Annakin didn't build C3P0. He found him in the desert and lied to his Mom about putting him together from scratch. Chewbacca has fleas. This whole mess with Vader and the fall of the Republic can be blamed on that stupid b***h Amma-Lamma-Ding-Dong. If she had any brains she wouldn't have come within a light year of Annie, but she had told do what George Lucas wrote for her.

{"value":"i searched video store everywhere to find this movie, being the huge elvis fan that i am, and i found it to be a huge disappointment. kurt russel had most of the \"elvis moves\" down and the voice imitation was great, but the dubbed in singing voice of elvis just didnt work for me. the voice didnt always match up with russels mouth, and it was hard for me to get lost in the plot because it bothered me that it was noticeable. also, there were so many freaking discrepancies in the film, people who dont know much about elvis would probably think them to be facts. songs are sung by him earlier than he recorded them in real life, the time when he got his first guitar is wrong, im pretty sure his brother jesse garron was buried in an unmarked grave, not one with a huge headstone reading JESSE GARRON. i know it was just a tv movie, but they skipped over important events, like the come-back-special, and dragged some scenes out for way too long. if you want to see a good movie that shows elvis in his prime rent THATS THE WAY IT IS, or another elvis concert. hearing and seeing the real elvis preform is the only way to truly see his talent. (brilliant statement i know, but still...go out and rent a good elvis

{"value":"Just what we need! Another remake of vintage Hollywood cinema, with Eddie Murphy miscast again in his second time around after THE NUTTY PROFESSOR (1996)! This shows why we're running out of special ideas in making a quality movie, ladies and gentlemen! It has some signs of hope for its likeable and delightful imagery of animals who can act and speak with humans. Things can only get more worse, unfortunately. Bathroom jokes and sexual references kill this piece of \"family\" funfare instantly. Even parents and children saw the trailer ad on The Family Channel, which was followed by utter angst and disgust in the movie theater. Sad to say this is the more progressive pre-millennium era, but enjoy it while it lasts 'cause things can only get worse with time. More went wrong with the all-new DR. DOLITTLE. It is absolutely plotless, feeling too flat. I also hate that irritating voice of Chris Rock!!! We need more talented voice-overs than a bunch of overpaid celebs who don't want to declare bankruptcy.

{"value":"The best thing about camp films in general is that you know what to expect. It's like watching a professional wrestling match or a day time soap opera or a Jerry Springer show: you immediately can follow the skimpy plot, identify the cardboard characters, and watch in satisfaction while all the cliches are being fulfilled. However, at times, the director does something real unexpected. It may be something extraordinarily stupid, or something weird, or something insightful. The director Makinen is up there with the best camp directors, and this is his best movie.<br /><br />In Yon saalistajat, everything seems to come together. There's nothing good about it, but still manages to be a coherent whole. Not once does the movie slow down - the action flows on and punches keep on coming.<br /><br />The weirdest thing is that there's no sense of time: some characters seem to take months doing something while other characters have only spent one hour at a bar.

{"value":"Do not be mistaken, this is neither a horror, nor really a film. I firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure; the only reason it merited a star was the presence of Chris Pine.<br /><br />Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist, a hint of surprise, a plot to emerge - but no.<br /><br />The characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet don't have the time to develop - thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful (bring on the teen rock montage) state. The only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic 'companion'.<br /><br />Their encounters with obstacles (be they human or physical) are brief, confusing and entirely pointless.<br /><br />Chris Pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast. Lou Taylor Pucci couldn't be dryer if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada desert.<br /><br />Watch 'The Road', watch '28 days Later', watch day time TV...anything but this; I implore you.

{"value":"When I caught a glimpse of the title I thought are we going to get another try-hard hip slasher, but actually I found \"7eventy 5ive\" to be a mildly passable, and almost 80s throwback after a tediously slow mid-section it picks up momentum for the final half-hour leading to it's outrageously tacky climax and downright cop out ending. It won't win awards for originality, because it's as systematic as you can get and steals its thunder in the way of thrills (usual cheap jump scares), location (secluded mansion) and motivation from other films. The gleaming direction is by-the-book and the material is quite hackneyed with poorly realised red herrings within its elaborate plotting and flimsy script. Sometimes laughable, but nonetheless I was entertained mainly due to its brutal and grisly acts of pulpy violence towards some rather obnoxiously annoying college students by a psychotic killer with a battle axe. The performances weren't bad in the shape of a spunky young cast, however the characters they were portraying weren't particularly enticing. An always presentable Rutger Hauer shows up in a short supportive role as a grizzled detective.

{"value":"The Slackers as titled in this movie are three college friends Dave, Jeff and Sam(Devon Sawa, Michael Maronna and Jason Segel respectively), who are about to graduate from university without sitting through an honest exam but making it end successfully. This continues until the very end when unlikeable but the most likable character of the movie Nathan(Schwartzman) figures out what they are up to. Nathan starts blackmailing in order to make up with his dream girl as he cant pursue that in normal conditions. The only problem is when the trio starts to work on it, Dave falls in love with the gorgeous and good hearted Angela(James King) Unfortunately, not a brilliant genre movie. Schwartzman makes to watch the movie easy as his performance is brilliant. King's performance is average, I think she was hired just to be around with her gorgeous look. The Slackers is reminiscent of American Pie with a different direction. Jokes are as shallow as in American Pie. But aren't they all used? I think this movie is a warning to the filmmakers of the genre that they are running out of originality. Overall, a few smiley moments but a horrible movie in terms of acting(except for Schwartzman) and subject. * out of

{"value":"Some might say something like \"Baby Geniuses\" with its giant robot infants or \"Dumbo\" with its psychedelic drug-addled nightmare sequence would win the award for the most disturbing movie ever made for children. You might say that too, but you'd be wrong. Lo and behold, for I bring to you: Santa Claus, the most helplessly messed up family film since ... well, ever. <br /><br />From the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their insipid theme songs (seriously, this segment is nearly 20 freakin' minutes long and has nothing to do with the plot!) to the thrilling conclusion in which Merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day (don't mind him, he's from Barcelona), this is childhood trauma at its finest. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I just... can't... get... those... reindeer's...laughter...out... of... my ... head! <br /><br />Avoid this mind-bending piece of trash like you'd avoid a sex-starved whale during mating season. Still, if flaming gay demons with a serious case of the overacting flu are something for you, I guess you should give it a try.

{"value":"\"A Gentleman's Game\" uses the game of golf in a country club setting to illustrate an adolescent's discovery about honesty, prejudice, and other life lessons. Several times I thought I knew where this film was heading, only to be proved wrong. Unfortunately, I'm not so sure that the filmmakers ever knew where it was heading, either. The defining moment in this movie is probably the scene in which Gary Sinise mocks \"The Karate Kid\" and debunks any notions that he's going to become a mentor to the adolescent golfer. It's refreshing, in a way, that this movie refuses to follow most of the simplistic and over-worked movie formulas. However, too much of it still comes off as contrived. At the drop of a hat people drop all pretenses of civility, or fail to stick up for the things in which they believe, or are exposed for something far less respectable than their place in society assumes. Unfortunately, there is often no resolution to these moments. And except for the fact that the club serves as backdrop for them, there is no real continuity or linking of them. It's a shame that the writers and director could not salvage a better film, especially given some of the talented actors and potential in the setup.","finished_norm":["a","gentleman","game","us","the","game","of","golf","in","a","countri","club","set","to","illustr","a","adolesc","discoveri","about","honesti","prejudic","and","other","life","lesson","sever","time","i","think","i","know","where","thi","film","be","head","onli","to","be","prove","wrong","unfortun","i","be","not","so","sure","that","the","filmmak","ever","know","where","it","be","head","either","the","defin","moment","in","thi","movi","be","probabl","the","scene","in","which","gari","sinis","mock","the","karat","kid","and","debunk","ani","notion","that","he","go","to","becom","a","mentor","to","the","adolesc","golfer","it","refresh","in","a","wai","that","thi","movi","refus","to","follow","much","of","the","simplist","and","overwork","movi","formula","howev","too","much","of","it","still","come","off","a","contriv","at","the","drop","of","a","hat","peopl","drop","all","pretens","of","civil","or","fail","to","stick","up","for","the","thing","in","which","thei","believ","or","be","expos","for","someth","far","littl","respect","than","their","place","in","societi","assum","unfortun","there","be","often","no","resolut","to","thi","moment","and","except","for","the","fact","that","the","club","serv","a","backdrop","for","them","there","be","no","real","continu","or","link","of","them","it","a","shame","that","the","writer","and","director","can","not","salvag","a","well","film","especi","give","some","of","the","talent","actor","and","potenti","in","the","setup"],"filtered":["gentleman","game","us","game","golf","countri","club","set","illustr","adolesc","discoveri","honesti","prejudic","life","lesson","sever","time","think","know","thi","film","head","onli","prove","wrong","unfortun","sure","filmmak","ever","know","head","either","defin","moment","thi","movi","probabl","scene","gari","sinis","mock","karat","kid","debunk","ani","notion","go","becom","mentor","adolesc","golfer","refresh","wai","thi","movi","refus","follow","much","simplist","overwork","movi","formula","howev","much","still","come","contriv","drop","hat","peopl","drop","pretens","civil","fail","stick","thing","thei","believ","expos","someth","far","littl","respect","place","societi","assum","unfortun","often","resolut","thi","moment","except","fact","club","serv","backdrop","real","continu","link","shame","writer","director","salvag","well","film","especi","give","talent","actor","potenti","setup"],"filtered2":["gentleman","game","us","game","golf","countri","club","set","illustr","adolesc","discoveri","honesti","prejudic","life","lesson","sever","time","think","know","head","onli","prove","wrong","unfortun","sure","filmmak","ever","know","head","either","defin","moment","probabl","scene","gari","sinis","mock","karat","kid","debunk","ani","notion","go","becom","mentor","adolesc","golfer","refresh","wai","refus","follow","simplist","overwork","formula","howev","still","come","contriv","drop","hat","peopl","drop","pretens","civil","fail","stick","thing","believ","expos","someth","far","littl","respect","place","societi","assum","unfortun","often","resolut","moment","except","fact","club","serv","backdrop","real","continu","link","shame","writer","director","salvag","well","especi","give","talent","actor","potenti","setup"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,8,11,12,14,19,20,23,25,26,27,29,30,33,34,41,44,53,56,58,64,75,80,91,97,101,109,113,114,115,119,148,164,188,207,208,215,227,232,260,267,276,287,316,323,374,400,416,433,540,547,574,608,694,815,904,920,1035,1049,1176,1180,1272,1545,1726,1732,1790,1985,2110,2250,2362,2373,2639,2711,2816,3001,3002,3263,3428,3494,3568,3575,3760,3794,4003,4503,4746,5522],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,8,11,12,14,19,20,23,25,26,27,29,30,33,34,41,44,53,56,58,64,75,80,91,97,101,109,113,114,115,119,148,164,188,207,208,215,227,232,260,267,276,287,316,323,374,400,416,433,540,547,574,608,694,815,904,920,1035,1049,1176,1180,1272,1545,1726,1732,1790,1985,2110,2250,2362,2373,2639,2711,2816,3001,3002,3263,3428,3494,3568,3575,3760,3794,4003,4503,4746,5522],"values":[0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.7003182735607676,1.8610609350701788,1.865701314626681,1.883428577602134,1.9742250248702675,1.9951803900462557,2.0105926690411424,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.125691139326857,2.1521782565202803,2.4433074195966826,2.201553588425805,2.16534089

{"value":"I really love the sexy action and sci-fi films of the sixties and its because of the actress's that appeared in them. They found the sexiest women to be in these films and it didn't matter if they could act (Remember \"Candy\"?). The reason I was disappointed by this film was because it wasn't nostalgic enough. The story here has a European sci-fi film called \"Dragonfly\" being made and the director is fired. So the producers decide to let a young aspiring filmmaker (Jeremy Davies) to complete the picture. They're is one real beautiful woman in the film who plays Dragonfly but she's barely in it. Film is written and directed by Roman Coppola who uses some of his fathers exploits from his early days and puts it into the script. I wish the film could have been an homage to those early films. They could have lots of cameos by actors who appeared in them. There is one actor in this film who was popular from the sixties and its John Phillip Law (Barbarella). Gerard Depardieu, Giancarlo Giannini and Dean Stockwell appear as well. I guess I'm going to have to continue waiting for a director to make a good homage to the films of the sixties.

{"value":"\"Happy Go Lovely\" has only two things going for it. And those two things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical complete with second tier stars. I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. But, I'm sorry to say, Ms. Ellen's chance did not pay off.<br /><br />Opening with a horrible Scottish number and stumbling thru awful dialog to the next dull tune, this movie seems very heavy handed and sloppy. The predictable mistaken identity plot is very thin, and with the exception of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is way over the top in his role of a Producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally wasted in a nothing role) the rest of the cast is totally forgettable.<br /><br />The choreography is boring, but Ms. Ellen gives it her all. She was never as famous as most of the other musical stars(and she shouldn't be since she couldn't sing and even had a \"dancing stand in\" in several of her pictures\".

{"value":"That might be a bit harsh for me saying that, but sadly so far in his directing career its true. Just have a look at what he as done so far. They barely make it past the 3 star mark.<br /><br />Why did I watch this movie? 2 reasons. Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg. Lucy was outstanding in this movie, her performance carries the whole movie. I do hope she gets a \"blockbuster\" and breaks into the bigger league of actors, she clearly has the skills. Greg was not so impressive, typical TV acting style.<br /><br />The movie is oddly categorized as a horror. The only \"horror\" is short flashbacks, and they last a max of 2-5 seconds with a little blood in them. I personally would call this more a \"drama/thriller\".<br /><br />But no matter how interesting the story actually is, bad directing, editing and acting (appart from Lucy) destroys it. You get no real connection to the actors, something which is very important in a story like this one. You just sit there watching feeling nothing. Its like watching a bad TV soap....actually I think the TV soap would be more interesting.<br /><br />My advice: Stay away from this movie...or better yet just stay away from anything Michael Hurst is

{"value":"Unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else I would've chosen it. This movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance. Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters, Edward Hermann, the innocence of newcomer Aileen Quinn, and expert directing from seasoned pro John Huston (father of actress Angelica Huston)is what made this film so charming. Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming, and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel. Before she did this movie all Ashley Johnson was known for was her role as little Chrissie Seaver on the prime time show Growing Pains. She had a few bit parts in movies but I don't know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own. And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom, ridiculous! They couldn't get good enough actors to play the major roles like Daddy Warbucks, Miss Hannigan, and Annie but they will sign Joan Collins to play some British lady? It doesn't surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was. The critics were right to have not agreed with this movie, even if it was only made for TV, it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie.","finished_norm":["unfortun","there","be","not","a","for","a","rate","or","els","i","would","have","choos","it","thi","movi","lack","the","star","power","that","the","origin","movi","have","in","such","abund","carol","burnett","albert","finnei","tim","curri","bernadett","peter","edward","hermann","the","innoc","of","newcom","aileen","quinn","and","expert","direct","from","season","pro","john","huston","father","of","actress","angelica","hustoni","what","make","thi","film","so","charm","even","the","remak","with","kathi","bate","victor","garber","alan","cum","and","kristin","chenoweth","have","much","to","offer","than","thi","sorri","excus","for","a","sequel","befor","she","do","thi","movi","all","ashlei","johnson","be","know","for","be","her","role","a","littl","chrissi","seaver","on","the","prime","time","show","grow","pain","she","have","a","few","bite","part","in","movi","but","i","do","not","know","who","think","she","have","talent","enough","to","carri","a","movi","on","her","own","and","add","joan","collin","a","ladi","edwina","hogbottom","ridicul","thei","can","not","get","good","enough","actor","to","plai","the","major","role","like","daddi","warbuck","miss","hannigan","and","anni","but","thei","will","sign","joan","collin","to","plai","some","british","ladi","it","doe","not","surpris","me","that","thi","movi","be","a","bad","a","it","be","the","critic","be","right","to","have","not","agre","with","thi","movi","even","if","it","be","onli","make","for","tv","it","be","a","poor","sequel","to","a","otherwis","lovabl","movi"],"filtered":["unfortun","rate","els","choos","thi","movi","lack","star","power","origin","movi","abund","carol","burnett","albert","finnei","tim","curri","bernadett","peter","edward","hermann","innoc","newcom","aileen","quinn","expert","direct","season","pro","john","huston","father","actress","angelica","hustoni","make","thi","film","charm","even","remak","kathi","bate","victor","garber","alan","cum","kristin","chenoweth","much","offer","thi","sorri","excus","sequel","befor","thi","movi","ashlei","johnson","know","role","littl","chrissi","seaver","prime","time","show","grow","pain","bite","part","movi","know","think","talent","enough","carri","movi","add","joan","collin","ladi","edwina","hogbottom","ridicul","thei","get","good","enough","actor","plai","major","role","like","daddi","warbuck","miss","hannigan","anni","thei","sign","joan","collin","plai","british","ladi","doe","surpris","thi","movi","bad","critic","right","agre","thi","movi","even","onli","make","tv","poor","sequel","otherwis","lovabl","movi"],"filtered2":["unfortun","rate","els","choos","lack","star","power","origin","abund","carol","burnett","albert","finnei","tim","curri","bernadett","peter","edward","hermann","innoc","newcom","aileen","quinn","expert","direct","season","pro","john","huston","father","actress","angelica","hustoni","make","charm","even","remak","kathi","bate","victor","garber","alan","cum","kristin","chenoweth","offer","sorri","excus","sequel","befor","ashlei","johnson","know","role","littl","chrissi","seaver","prime","time","show","grow","pain","bite","part","know","think","talent","enough","carri","add","joan","collin","ladi","edwina","hogbottom","ridicul","get","good","enough","actor","plai","major","role","like","daddi","warbuck","miss","hannigan","anni","sign","joan","collin","plai","british","ladi","doe","surpris","bad","critic","right","agre","even","onli","make","tv","poor","sequel","otherwis","lovabl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,8,9,11,12,14,18,26,28,40,41,61,69,79,93,100,102,121,128,146,154,172,183,196,202,227,255,274,276,291,299,326,343,355,365,387,404,437,458,472,483,507,561,579,584,617,621,622,627,696,760,797,817,876,1153,1444,1604,1935,1940,2062,2143,2190,2287,2366,2482,2710,2903,3283,3487,3610,3823,3831,4091,4136,4655,5056,5192,5797,7056,7169],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,8,9,11,12,14,18,26,28,40,41,61,69,79,93,100,102,121,128,146,154,172,183,196,202,227,255,274,276,291,299,326,343,355,365,387,404,437,458,472,483,507,561,579,584,617,621,622,627,696,760,797,817,876,1153,1444,1604,1935,1940,2062,2143,2190,2287,2366,2482,2710,2903,3283,3487,3610,3823,3831,4091,4136,4655,5056,5192,5797,7056,7169],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,2.6649848339420377,1.5452294193519092,3.2569937516641474,1.5687599167621034,1.8818517047392527,2.127032521151058,1.9469506069506084,4.070779654240196,2.1405462403177813,2.087553710

{"value":"That song keeps humming in my head. Not the greatest song, but it's the 80's. This movie is about a lead singer who \"supposebly\" gets killed while being accused of murders as he stalks his girlfriend who sings backup vocals in his band. The lead singer whos name is Billy \"Eye\" (yeah, right) is dead after two years and his band comes back for a concert only the backup vocalist is the lead singer this time. Billy stalks her and eventually goes around killing all these people and terrifying the girl and makeing people around her think theres something wrong with her and that shes imagining things. She finally decides to go to a cemetary and dig up his grave to see if he's still there. She sees that he's dead but still see's and hears his voice. During the end of the movie we find out the reason behind all of this, Billy has a brother named John (right again) and John admits that he was jealous of his brother and that he killed all those people to get back at him and place the blame on his brother and then take his girlfriend and terrorize her because she called him crazy.

{"value":"If I accidentally stumbled across this script in textual form i would read it and maybe laugh. I would not, however laugh at the points in the film where the director would seem to want me to laugh. Although I am still not altogether sure where these are. I don't care if this is Woody Allen, this writer cannot write dialogue, or at least he cannot knowingly write dialogue then draw performances from actors capable of drawing laughter from even the most ticklish of clowns. For example:<br /><br />(paraphrase) \"I'm an art historian, i'm looking to get a job in an art gallery.\" <br /><br />OK, so it states the fact but honestly, do you know of any art historians who would say that? How would you answer? <br /><br />\"Really? An art gallery? who would've thought it?\"<br /><br />The entire script is littered with the kind of tawdry quasi-intellectualism that i would not have expected from such a respected character writer. I admit that I have no knowledge of Allen's other work and, judging by this one i don't want to start learning. The characters are loathsome without exception, an attempt to illustrate that we all suffer from the human condition? Or really really poor character writing?

{"value":"It wasn't good. The characters were underdeveloped and the only personality were from the memories I had of the previous movie which contrasted with the 'new' personalities (or lack thereof). I seriously thought the opening scene was a nightmare by Ariel because of how absurd it was. It was serious. It just reminded me of all the annoying characters on the Disney channel-everyone is hyperactive and the story jumps from action to embarrassing scenes without any really connection.<br /><br />The most disappointing part was the horrible songs-not catchy, not amazing. In the original Ariel had an amazing and powerful voice and all the song are catchy and fun. You remember them and want to sing them. But the songs in this movie weren't creative in the least; it's as if they're talking in a annoying sing-song voice-quite weakly, disappointing. I don't have that want-to-sing-them feeling you normally get from a Disney movie.<br /><br />It's as if not one wanted to do this movie, so they barely made an effort . . . this movie would needs a new story line, new catchy songs and more warmth and enthusiasm without the annoying \"look at me! look at me!

{"value":"Oh my goodness. This was a real big mess that just couldn't help itself. Jeffrey (Jon Heder) is a 29 year old man still living with his mum (Diane Keaton) and not planning on going anywhere. Until his mother meets a rich businessman named Mert (Jeff Daniels) who she may be getting married to.<br /><br />It would have been an OK movie if Heder didn't play his Jeffrey so annoying, from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse. In the end, we are supposed to like him, but there was no reason to as he hadn't changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />Keaton doesn't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007's Because I Said So. Not to mention the shocking chemistry between Heder and Keaton, and where supposed to believe that their mother and son? The only saving grace is Jeff Daniels and Anna Faris although they don't look very interested either. Apart from a few little smiles, this film really doesn't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at!

{"value":"Wow! I remember so many awful films that loosely revolved around high school from the early 1980s. They usually had someincredibly strained plot and lots of 27 year old actors pretending to be students. As I watched this film I felt a little of the nostalgia of growing up in the 1980s. However, then I find out that this film was made in 1989? Say what! Well, the nostalgia factor ends right there, this is just bad. The plot has the city preparing to close a high school and threatening to bus all of the students to inner city high schools. Which is odd, in that the students at this school are both wealthy and abundant. In fact, the main character lives in a mansion. Makes you wonder how they cannot find money to keep this school alive, have they never heard of property taxes. Oh, but here is the kicker. The school board says that they will keep the school alive, if the students can raise $200,000. So the seniors go about doing this. Hmmm, you raise $200,000 but instead of saving that for college, you put it towards saving the high school that you are a Senior in? And why exactly would they close an overpopulated school before the year is out?
