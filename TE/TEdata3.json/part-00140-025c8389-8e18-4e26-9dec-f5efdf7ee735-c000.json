{"value":"Yes. I'll admit it. I believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work, about the trials and tribulations of 6 people, living in Mexico City concerning their sexual lives. And so, I was really expecting to finally see a Mexican movie (in ages) that was both popular and interesting to watch. Unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing. The story presents us with two couples, both with very obvious marital problems. When a third party comes into the life of each couple, their problems reach a pivotal point. Or absolute absurd. The plot then turns into a battle of the sexes. The stance taken by each group (yes, they literally group, girls with girls and boys with boys) is blatantly stupid and childish (I guess the humor was supposed to be there). And it all goes from bad to worse. The performances range from good (Miss Zavaleta) to mediocre (Mr Bichir), with Serrano doing an acceptable job on his opera prima. However, the flat circumstances that make up the plot, the one-dimensional characters, the very poor (if not stupid) perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc, make the movie fail. Miserably. SPyL has had an (impressive) good reception at the box-office. Believe the hype at your own risk.","finished_norm":["ye","i","will","admit","it","i","believ","all","the","hyp","surround","thi","piec","of","work","about","the","trial","and","tribul","of","peopl","live","in","mexico","citi","concern","their","sexual","live","and","so","i","be","realli","expect","to","final","see","a","mexican","movi","in","ag","that","be","both","popular","and","interest","to","watch","unfortun","the","film","be","utterli","disappoint","the","stori","present","u","with","two","coupl","both","with","veri","obviou","marit","problem","when","a","parti","come","into","the","life","of","each","coupl","their","problem","reach","a","pivot","point","or","absolut","absurd","the","plot","then","turn","into","a","battl","of","the","sex","the","stanc","take","by","each","group","ye","thei","liter","group","girl","with","girl","and","boi","with","boi","be","blatantli","stupid","and","childish","i","guess","the","humor","be","suppos","to","be","there","and","it","all","go","from","bad","to","wrong","the","perform","rang","from","good","miss","zavaleta","to","mediocr","mr","bichir","with","serrano","do","a","accept","job","on","hi","opu","prima","howev","the","flat","circumst","that","make","up","the","plot","the","onedimension","charact","the","veri","poor","if","not","stupid","percept","of","what","sex","repres","in","a","matur","relationship","etc","make","the","movi","fail","miser","spyl","have","have","a","impress","good","recept","at","the","boxoffic","believ","the","hyp","at","your","own","risk"],"filtered":["ye","admit","believ","hyp","surround","thi","piec","work","trial","tribul","peopl","live","mexico","citi","concern","sexual","live","realli","expect","final","see","mexican","movi","ag","popular","interest","watch","unfortun","film","utterli","disappoint","stori","present","u","two","coupl","veri","obviou","marit","problem","parti","come","life","coupl","problem","reach","pivot","point","absolut","absurd","plot","turn","battl","sex","stanc","take","group","ye","thei","liter","group","girl","girl","boi","boi","blatantli","stupid","childish","guess","humor","suppos","go","bad","wrong","perform","rang","good","miss","zavaleta","mediocr","mr","bichir","serrano","accept","job","hi","opu","prima","howev","flat","circumst","make","plot","onedimension","charact","veri","poor","stupid","percept","sex","repres","matur","relationship","etc","make","movi","fail","miser","spyl","impress","good","recept","boxoffic","believ","hyp","risk"],"filtered2":["ye","admit","believ","hyp","surround","piec","work","trial","tribul","peopl","live","mexico","citi","concern","sexual","live","realli","expect","final","see","mexican","ag","popular","interest","watch","unfortun","utterli","disappoint","stori","present","u","two","coupl","veri","obviou","marit","problem","parti","come","life","coupl","problem","reach","pivot","point","absolut","absurd","plot","turn","battl","sex","stanc","take","group","ye","liter","group","girl","girl","boi","boi","blatantli","stupid","childish","guess","humor","suppos","go","bad","wrong","perform","rang","good","miss","zavaleta","mediocr","mr","bichir","serrano","accept","job","opu","prima","howev","flat","circumst","make","plot","onedimension","charact","veri","poor","stupid","percept","sex","repres","matur","relationship","etc","make","fail","miser","spyl","impress","good","recept","boxoffic","believ","hyp","risk"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,9,10,13,15,17,23,25,31,32,34,47,48,60,66,75,84,91,96,105,112,113,116,130,136,146,149,156,167,187,209,215,218,222,227,243,253,254,255,282,289,357,369,383,410,411,418,429,442,519,577,593,595,691,741,786,787,816,850,874,897,928,934,951,1200,1275,1330,1349,1554,1589,1859,1927,2009,2571,2572,2693,2768,2937,3261,4807,5108,6189,6549,7115,7554,7656],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,9,10,13,15,17,23,25,31,32,34,47,48,60,66,75,84,91,96,105,112,113,116,130,136,146,149,156,167,187,209,215,218,222,227,243,253,254,255,282,289,357,369,383,410,411,418,429,442,519,577,593,595,691,741,786,787,816,850,874,897,928,934,951,1200,1275,1330,1349,1554,1589,1859,1927,2009,2571,2572,2693,2768,2937,3261,4807,5108,6189,6549,7115,7554,7656],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.4070669811451506,2.742262257014735,1.3982850089458962,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,1.838176641236591,1.929723173391612,1.9742250248702675,4.442538903180445,4.021185338082285,2.0390708128715254,2.1765612129984904,2

{"value":"This was one of the worst films I have ever seen.<br /><br />I usually praise any film for some aspect of its production, but the intensely irritating behaviour of more than half the characters made it hard for me to appreciate any part of this film.<br /><br />Most common was the inference that the bloke who designed the building was at fault an avalanche collapsing it. Er ok.<br /><br />Also, trying to out ski an avalanche slalom style is not gonna work. Running 10 feet into some trees is not gonna work. Alas it does here. As mentioned before the innate dumbness and sheer stupidity of some characters is ridiculous. In an enclosed space, with limited oxygen a four year old could tell you starting a fire is not a good idea.<br /><br />Anyway, about 5 minutes of the movie redeems itself and acquires some appreciation. However, if you have a modicum of intelligence you too will find most of this film hard to tolerate.<br /><br />It pains me that so many quality stories go unproduced and yet someone will pay for things like this to be made.<br /><br />Oh, did I mention the last five minutes?

{"value":"The eight Jean Rollin film I have watched is also possibly the weirdest; the intriguing plot (such as it is) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along! A would-be female vampire (scantily-clad, as promised by the title) is held in captivity inside a remote château and emerges only to 'feast' on the blood of willing victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) As if unsure where all of this would lead him, the writer-director ultimately has the human villain  actually the blank-faced hero's kinky father  ludicrously revealed as a mutant(?!) from the future! The languorous pace and dream-like atmosphere (the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl) are, of course, typical of both the film-maker (ditto the seashore setting at the {anti}climax) and the \"Euro-Cult\" style, as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display.

{"value":"As if there weren't enough of those floating around at the time already, we have here another lame GODFATHER clone from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI (1973) which I had watched earlier this year. The marquee-value name roped in this time is Telly Savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind, rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of French painters! Apart from not looking minimally Sicilian, he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl. Antonio Sabato, then, makes for an unlikely gangster - apart from being a resistible leading man; his relationship with Savalas, which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye, is also unconvincing (especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latter's spirited teenage niece)! Besides, for a gangster flick, there's precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable (though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled); furthermore, the score by Francesco De Masi is serviceable but nothing else. Incidentally, the bargain-basement DVD I rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members - or even the film's title - is ever listed!","finished_norm":["a","if","there","be","not","enough","of","that","float","around","at","the","time","alreadi","we","have","here","anoth","lame","godfath","clone","from","the","director","of","il","consigliori","which","i","have","watch","earli","thi","year","the","marqueevalu","name","rope","in","thi","time","be","telli","savala","who","belatedli","enter","the","proceed","and","be","see","from","behind","rather","campili","tend","to","hi","flower","and","wear","a","beret","in","the","styl","of","french","painter","apart","from","not","look","minim","sicilian","he","sport","no","accent","of","ani","kind","other","than","hi","familiar","drawl","antonio","sabato","then","make","for","a","unlik","gangster","apart","from","be","a","resist","lead","man","hi","relationship","with","savala","which","becom","patern","at","the","flick","of","a","ey","be","conjur","unconvinc","especi","sinc","he","subsequ","becom","romant","involv","with","the","latter","spirit","teenag","niec","besid","for","a","gangster","flick","there","preciou","littl","action","to","speak","of","and","none","of","it","be","in","ani","wai","memor","though","the","final","set","in","a","clinic","be","good","enough","handl","furthermor","the","score","by","francesco","de","masi","be","servic","but","noth","els","incident","the","bargainbas","dvd","i","rent","start","off","midwai","through","the","credit","so","that","none","of","the","cast","member","or","even","the","film","titl","be","ever","list"],"filtered":["enough","float","around","time","alreadi","anoth","lame","godfath","clone","director","il","consigliori","watch","earli","thi","year","marqueevalu","name","rope","thi","time","telli","savala","belatedli","enter","proceed","see","behind","rather","campili","tend","hi","flower","wear","beret","styl","french","painter","apart","look","minim","sicilian","sport","accent","ani","kind","hi","familiar","drawl","antonio","sabato","make","unlik","gangster","apart","resist","lead","man","hi","relationship","savala","becom","patern","flick","ey","conjur","unconvinc","especi","sinc","subsequ","becom","romant","involv","latter","spirit","teenag","niec","besid","gangster","flick","preciou","littl","action","speak","none","ani","wai","memor","though","final","set","clinic","good","enough","handl","furthermor","score","francesco","de","masi","servic","noth","els","incident","bargainbas","dvd","rent","start","midwai","credit","none","cast","member","even","film","titl","ever","list"],"filtered2":["enough","float","around","time","alreadi","anoth","lame","godfath","clone","director","il","consigliori","watch","earli","year","marqueevalu","name","rope","time","telli","savala","belatedli","enter","proceed","see","behind","rather","campili","tend","flower","wear","beret","styl","french","painter","apart","look","minim","sicilian","sport","accent","ani","kind","familiar","drawl","antonio","sabato","make","unlik","gangster","apart","resist","lead","man","relationship","savala","becom","patern","flick","ey","conjur","unconvinc","especi","sinc","subsequ","becom","romant","involv","latter","spirit","teenag","niec","besid","gangster","flick","preciou","littl","action","speak","none","ani","wai","memor","though","final","set","clinic","good","enough","handl","furthermor","score","francesco","de","masi","servic","noth","els","incident","bargainbas","dvd","rent","start","midwai","credit","none","cast","member","even","titl","ever","list"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,7,8,14,16,27,33,39,44,45,49,57,58,71,73,86,92,93,98,109,115,122,129,143,156,157,160,162,196,241,247,257,264,266,267,281,330,344,356,370,373,380,393,514,518,559,572,577,601,615,618,661,693,750,864,894,899,945,972,1074,1095,1170,1399,1460,1632,1677,1707,1711,2066,2174,2530,2648,2662,2775,2807,3007,3181,3185,3215,3520,3571,5540,5545,5697,5712,5728,6050,7230,7431],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,7,8,14,16,27,33,39,44,45,49,57,58,71,73,86,92,93,98,109,115,122,129,143,156,157,160,162,196,241,247,257,264,266,267,281,330,344,356,370,373,380,393,514,518,559,572,577,601,615,618,661,693,750,864,894,899,945,972,1074,1095,1170,1399,1460,1632,1677,1707,1711,2066,2174,2530,2648,2662,2775,2807,3007,3181,3185,3215,3520,3571,5540,5545,5697,5712,5728,6050,7230,7431],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,2.600540117735859,1.4018535447685214,1.5538940054862738,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,1.6920303308087352,1.834162586674748,1.865701314626681,1.9214926742550966,1.895068920

{"value":"Sometimes a premise starts out good, but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention-deficit disorder, it devolves into an incongruous mess. And for three well-respected actors who have made better work before and after, this is a mortal shame.<br /><br />So let's see. Premise: a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop. Interesting to say the least. Make the encroaching cop a little disturbing, why not. It was well done in THE HAND WHO ROCKS THE CRADLE and SINGLE WHITE FEMALE, and it's a proved ticket to a successful thriller.<br /><br />Now herein lies the dilemma. Create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous, or throw any semblance to reality, amp up the shock factor, and make this cop so extreme -- an ultra bad variation of every other super-villain that's hit cinemas since the silent age.<br /><br />The producers, and directors, chose the latter. Thus is the resulting film -- badly made, with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that they've essayed before, and nothing much amounting to even less.","finished_norm":["sometim","a","premis","start","out","good","but","becaus","of","the","demand","of","have","to","go","overboard","to","meet","the","demand","of","a","audienc","suffer","from","attentiondeficit","disord","it","devolv","into","a","incongru","mess","and","for","three","wellrespect","actor","who","have","make","well","work","befor","and","after","thi","be","a","mortal","shamebr","br","so","let","see","premis","a","love","coupl","who","live","in","a","beauti","home","be","threaten","by","a","bad","cop","interest","to","sai","the","littl","make","the","encroach","cop","a","littl","disturb","why","not","it","be","good","do","in","the","hand","who","rock","the","cradl","and","singl","white","femal","and","it","a","prove","ticket","to","a","success","thrillerbr","br","now","herein","lie","the","dilemma","creat","a","disturb","stori","that","actual","bother","to","bring","some","true","menac","into","it","main","charact","while","never","go","so","far","a","to","look","ridicul","or","throw","ani","semblanc","to","realiti","amp","up","the","shock","factor","and","make","thi","cop","so","extrem","a","ultra","bad","variat","of","everi","other","supervillain","that","hit","cinema","sinc","the","silent","agebr","br","the","produc","and","director","choos","the","latter","thu","be","the","result","film","badli","make","with","actor","try","their","darnedest","to","make","head","or","tail","in","role","that","thei","have","essai","befor","and","noth","much","amount","to","even","littl"],"filtered":["sometim","premis","start","good","becaus","demand","go","overboard","meet","demand","audienc","suffer","attentiondeficit","disord","devolv","incongru","mess","three","wellrespect","actor","make","well","work","befor","thi","mortal","shamebr","br","let","see","premis","love","coupl","live","beauti","home","threaten","bad","cop","interest","sai","littl","make","encroach","cop","littl","disturb","good","hand","rock","cradl","singl","white","femal","prove","ticket","success","thrillerbr","br","herein","lie","dilemma","creat","disturb","stori","actual","bother","bring","true","menac","main","charact","never","go","far","look","ridicul","throw","ani","semblanc","realiti","amp","shock","factor","make","thi","cop","extrem","ultra","bad","variat","everi","supervillain","hit","cinema","sinc","silent","agebr","br","produc","director","choos","latter","thu","result","film","badli","make","actor","try","darnedest","make","head","tail","role","thei","essai","befor","noth","much","amount","even","littl"],"filtered2":["sometim","premis","start","good","becaus","demand","go","overboard","meet","demand","audienc","suffer","attentiondeficit","disord","devolv","incongru","mess","three","wellrespect","actor","make","well","work","befor","mortal","shamebr","let","see","premis","love","coupl","live","beauti","home","threaten","bad","cop","interest","littl","make","encroach","cop","littl","disturb","good","hand","rock","cradl","singl","white","femal","prove","ticket","success","thrillerbr","herein","lie","dilemma","creat","disturb","stori","actual","bother","bring","true","menac","main","charact","never","go","far","look","ridicul","throw","ani","semblanc","realiti","amp","shock","factor","make","cop","extrem","ultra","bad","variat","everi","supervillain","hit","cinema","sinc","silent","agebr","produc","director","choos","latter","thu","result","badli","make","actor","try","darnedest","make","head","tail","role","essai","befor","noth","amount","even","littl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,9,10,14,16,17,20,22,27,36,41,42,48,49,52,54,58,60,71,79,85,101,116,124,128,162,168,179,208,224,235,250,253,261,274,302,304,310,325,329,350,359,362,388,407,409,422,443,447,448,476,484,496,500,508,532,540,582,584,633,650,656,771,839,1192,1225,1460,1572,1639,1683,1820,2218,3359,3650,3808,4030,4196,4315,4412,4440,4899,5318,5895,6653,8031,8524],"values":[5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,9,10,14,16,17,20,22,27,36,41,42,48,49,52,54,58,60,71,79,85,101,116,124,128,162,168,179,208,224,235,250,253,261,274,302,304,310,325,329,350,359,362,388,407,409,422,443,447,448,476,484,496,500,508,532,540,582,584,633,650,656,771,839,1192,1225,1460,1572,1639,1683,1820,2218,3359,3650,3808,4030,4196,4315,4412,4440,4899,5318,5895,6653,8031,8524],"values":[3.099883578102616,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,3.3525245991777624,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.3002700588679295,1.4680183469605717,3.1375198335242067,1.6219954307453837,1.6955116224012472,1.

{"value":"Susan Seidelman seems to have had a decent career with a few top notch credits under her belt. I'm certainly glad she bounced back from this film which seems to have its admirers. I'm not one of them.<br /><br />I've seen better acting in high school plays than I did in Smithereens. The plot such as it is involved young Susan Berman who is ambitious to make it in the world of music and is willing to do just about anything to get there. She even rejects the sincere advances of a young artist who is living out of his van off the East River played by Brad Rijn.<br /><br />Young Mr. Rijn contributes the worst performance in the film, in fact one of the worst acting jobs I've seen in a long time. No wonder he's not gone anywhere.<br /><br />I will say that Seidelman's eye for the camera is a good one in capturing the familiar East Village locations where the film was mostly shot. But her work with her live performers didn't measure up. I'm not sure she had that much raw material to work with.<br /><br />Look fast and you'll see a very young Christopher Noth before Law and Order and Sex in the City as a street hustler.<br /><br />If you like punk rock, you might sit through this for the soundtrack. I'll stick to Bing

{"value":"<br /><br />Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes is a \"parody\" of bad monster movies which ends up being worse than the movies it spoofs. The (very meager) story tells of tomatoes who revolt against those who treat them badly. Basically,they spin and growl (yes,they growl) and the next thing you know the person is covered in ketchup. The actors are no-names who never made movies after this,so there would be no point to name them. There's a guy who's hired by the governement to try and stop the menace of tomatoes. He's accompanied by a black guy who's master of disguise and a girl and a guy who dives. Anyway, there's another woman who spies on the first guy that works for the government. if this isn't making much sense to you, you understand. This movie never would have been very good in the first place, but it even lacks the fun of laughing at stupid attack scenes. The movie is horribly cheezy, which although being the whole point,really really hurts what could've been a (reasonably) entertaining movie. At one point, a giant wax tomato \"slides\" on an unconcealed plank of wood with wheels on it! Maybe I would've recommended the movie if it would have enjoyable camp value, but even this is lacking from this terrible movie.

{"value":"Saw this late one night on cable. At the time I didn't know that the girl billed as \"Shannon Wilsey\" was actually porn star Savannah, but she was so beautiful (and got naked so often, thank God) that I actually sat through this brain-rotting drivel. I like cheesy flicks as much as the next guy--more than the next guy, actually--but this was way beyond cheesy and more into rancid. The truly annoying overacting by the mad scientist and the director's, writers' and special effects people's virtually total incompetence detracts from the gratuitous nudity that is the movie's only saving grace. Savannah, before she turned into the plasticized Barbie Doll she became as a porn queen, is really interesting to watch--she's drop-dead gorgeous, bursts into uncontrollable giggling at times, glances off-camera and laughs and just generally seems to be having a really good time, which is more than can be said for the audience. For even though Savannah and her colleagues spend a fair amount of this picture naked, it still can't hide the fact that this is an incredibly stupid, badly made and annoying movie.

{"value":"Much has been made of Rohmer's use of digital technology to 'fill in' the background. At times it works well, the scene where Grace and her maid witness from afar the King's execution is particularly striking. At other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look, resembling a home video. However, the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer. We know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters? To be frank, I did not care at all what happened to the Lady or the Duke.<br /><br />The other major failing, I regret to say, is the performance of Lucy Russell in the leading role. She is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance. OK she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion. Her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend Mme de Meyler (an excellent performance by the debutante Helena Dubiel) seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience. Also, watch her hands when she is expressing emotion!<br /><br />All in all a very disappointing film, particularly given the positive reviews on this

{"value":"If this series supposed to be an improvement over Batman - The Animated Series, I, for one, think it failed terribly. The character drawing is lousy... (Catwoman, for instance, looks awful...) But what really annoyed me is that it made Batman look like a sort of wimp who just can't take care of himself in a battle, without the help of two, even three sidekicks. I mean, he's Batman, for God's sake! I know the comic books, I know that Nightwing and Batgirl are supposed to be Batman's allies, besides Robin, but still... making Batman say that he needs help from them... What, he can't handle a few punches? In BTAS, he could face a dozen adversaries without any problem... He's getting old? Come on...<br /><br />And another thing: I really don't think that Batman would allow a kid like Tim Drake to go into battle that soon, without years of hard training. One, it's irresponsible (and Batman is everything, but irresponsible), and two, it's not what happened in the comics, if we are to remain faithful to them.<br /><br />Batman - The Animated Series made history, with its animation, its stories and its characters...

{"value":"Updating of the Bliss theme is merely the latest in a lengthening queue of bad-to-average local comedies which appeal to the conservative cinema-going set. (For the record, this list, all of the films on which appear to be attempting a Castle-esque miracle, includes, Strange Bedfellows, Thunderstruck, Bad Eggs, The Honourable Wally Norman, Horseplay, The Wannabes and The Nugget. The only one to have worked has been Crackerjack.)<br /><br />Here, the performances never mesh, as John Howard doesn't even look like he's in the right film  though perhaps that was the intention, as Franklin plays sleepy, conservative suburbia against its more interesting inhabitants. 20-year-old virgins who live with their parents are becoming rarer on-screen, but this is hardly a reason to watch the film. In fact, the only reasons may well be (1) Howard's bizarre  but quite fun  performance, and (2) the 'suburban nightmare' theme, which has run through Somersault, Strange Bedfellows, Tom White, Alexandra's Project, Danny Deckchair, The Rage in Placid Lake, Traveling Light, Teesh & Trude, Swimming Upstream and Lantana, many of which are very good/excellent. Enter at own risk!

{"value":"With no affinity towards any type of filmmaking, and a healthy appreciation of documentaries, I can honestly say I was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of \"20 Dates\". I won't waste your time with the plot, you may read other reviews. I will say though that Berkowitz's hyper, Woody Allen-style narration was extremely annoying. You either wished he'd lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers. And it's potentially apparent to Berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea, as parts of it details his trials to finance the documentary. Forgive me for disguising insults as compliments, but I'll give credit to Berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrid piece of ****. I appreciate the boundaries & intentions of the film here, but even when regarding the standards Berkowitz sets for himself, he fires off and misses on all levels. In closing, I'm sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy wanna-be filmmaker, and therefore I question the film's sense of authenticity. Hey Myles, I loved your film the first time I saw it... when it appeared as an episode of Seinfeld or was a film directed by Woody Allen or Kevin

{"value":"Without a doubt, this is one of the worst pictures I ever actually paid money to see - the kind of flick you choose out of desperation at the mall cinema during a Christmas holiday when you have missed the start times for anything good but still are dead set on seeing a movie! And that is exactly how I came to see this stink bomb...<br /><br />At the distance of the better part of three decades I can still smell the rotting fish that constitute this story line. Unbelievable plot - that a killer whale carries a grudge against an individual not of the sea - is laughable. And that's about all, except for a completely out-of-place \"love theme\" that plays over the finish of a film devoid of a love story. At least Charlotte Rampling is lovely (in a two dimensional role) but Richard Harris just chews up the scenery. He was no Captain Quint (Robert Shaw) and this is no \"Jaws\". Mercifully, I have put most of it out of mind and when I run across it on television air casts I move on immediately. \"Danger, Will Robinson!\" See the current t.v. commercial showing a husband and wife whale-watching (\"Orca - I love Orca...\") - at least it is over in sixty seconds.

{"value":"Honestly, who in God's name gave this movie an 8.1 rating?? I guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted. Otherwise this movie sucks! This movie is nothing more than an amateur, or possibly student, film. I'm a movie fanatic, and have seen terrible movies, but there was literally nothing redeeming here. The story and acting was the worst I've ever seen. The props, including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects, where just as bad as everything else. I'm all for bad language in movies, but the F-Bomb was dropped about every third word and I think we might have a winner for the most use of the F-Bomb in any movie EVER. The movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film. I'd expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country, but it doesn't belong on a DVD.<br /><br />Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. This is valuable time that you will NEVER get back.

{"value":"I'm a big mark for the music of Neil Young, and with that and the glowing praise the film received in many alt-indie press circles, hit the first showing of Greendale I could find. My excitement was short-lived, as this turgid storyline and weak lyrical momentum left most filmgoers either asleep or disappointed.<br /><br />Neil says the film started as a soundtrack, and the characters came to life so much that they just filmed the soundtrack. Not the best way to craft a story. No character really has an arc, and when \"significant\" events do happen, the viewer doesn't cared, because film technique annoyance levels are so high by that point. The film is all song, and to that end, the characters on end mouth the lyrics as they're sung...the technique works for the first stanza it is done, and is grating on the nerves after that. It doesn't feel real or fake, it just feels unwelcome.<br /><br />Terrible acting, with characters finding one mood and playing all of it. Poor lighting at times. The only kudos I can give the film are in regard to several scenes shot as newscast, but the technique is so used in cinema today that this film did little to further it. An alright soundtrack, but nothing I'm quick to buy.

{"value":"A spoiler.<br /><br />What three words can guarantee you a terrible film? Cheap Canadian Production. THE BRAIN fits those words perfectly. Terrible script, idiotic acting and hilarious special effects make this a must for every BAD movie fan. The horror is hilarious. The post production team looks like it gave up. What makes THE BRAIN admirable is in the second half, it actually tries to be good! Can a bit of ingenuity and consistency save what is already a joke?<br /><br />It's around Christmas time. A mother and daughter are murdered by one of the funniest looking villains ever. The day later, a rebel teen gets into enough trouble that he is sent for a psychiatric analysis.<br /><br />If a cop 's head is chopped off and a stranger with blood on him and a bloody axe told you some kids did it, who would you believe? What begins as funny turns dull and tiring toward the end when THE BRAIN tries to be serious. A child cannot be frightened by the scary moments. THE BRAIN is too funny a concept to try and be gritty. The Psychological Research Institute is larger than major manufacturing plants! Our ugly villain and its cohorts get credit for pulling some of the worst acting I have seen.

{"value":"One of Boris Karloff's real clinkers. Essentially the dying Karloff (looking about 120 years older than he was)is a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies. Moving from Morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else he goes to the South of France where he works a s physician while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories. Desperate for money he makes a deal with the young rich wife of a cotton baron who is dying. She will fund him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and carry on with a gigolo (who I think is married). If you think I got that from watching the movie you're wrong, I had to read what other people posted to figure out happened. Why? because this movie had me lost from two minutes in.I had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and multiple converging plot lines. Little is spelled out and much isn't said until towards the end by which time I really didn't care. Its a dull mess of interest purely for Karloff's performance which is rather odd at times. To be honest this is the only time I've ever seen him venture into Bela Lugosi bizarre territory. Its not every scene but a few and makes me wonder how much they hung

{"value":"In fact, Marc Blitzstein's off-Broadway adaptation of \"Threepenny\" was not so \"bowdlerised\" as is generally believed.<br /><br />(I have a special interest in \"Threepenny\"; my dad was part of the first full production in the US; U of Illlinois Theatre Guild did it around the end of WW2. HJitler had been so nearly successful in suppressing the play that they had to reconstruct the script and score from recordings in two different languages {neither English}, a German prompter's script and similar sources.) Blitzstein's adaptation -- not a \"translation\" -- which had the full approval of Lotte Lenya -- was a lot closer to the original than generally believed.<br /><br />The problem is that the version thereof that most people know is the MGM cast recording (recently available on Polygram on CD)(which includes Beatrice Arthur {as Lucy, the \"big complete girl\", and can't i see her hands on hips and

{"value":"This was the worst acted movie I've ever seen in my life. No, really. I'm not kidding. All the \"based on a true story/historical references\" aside, there's no excuse for such bad acting. It's a shame, because, as others have posted, the sets & costumes were great.<br /><br />The sound track was typical \"asian-style\" music, although I couldn't figure out where the \"modern\" love song came in when Fernando was lying in his bed thinking of Maria. I don't know who wrote & sang that beautiful song, but it was as if suddenly Norah Jones was transported to the 1500s.<br /><br />The Hershey syrup blood in Phycho was more realistic than the ketchup spurted during the Kwik-n-EZ battle scenes.<br /><br />But the acting. Oh, so painfully sad. Lines delivered like a bad junior high play. If Gary Stretch had donned a potato costume for the County 4H Fair he may have been more believable. Towards the end he sounded more like a Little Italy street thug.

{"value":"I'm going to have to disagree with the previous comment and side with Maltin on this one. This is a second rate, excessively vicious Western that creaks and groans trying to put across its central theme of the Wild West being tamed and kicked aside by the steady march of time. It would like to be in the tradition of \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\", but lacks that film's poignancy and charm. Andrew McLaglen's direction is limp, and the final 30 minutes or so are a real botch, with some incomprehensible strategy on the part of heroes Charlton Heston and Chris Mitchum. (Someone give me a holler if you can explain to me why they set that hillside on fire.) There was something callous about the whole treatment of the rape scene, and the woman's reaction afterwards certainly did not ring true. Coburn is plenty nasty as the half breed escaped convict out for revenge, but all of his fellow escapees are underdeveloped (they're like bowling pins to be knocked down one by one as the story lurches forward). Michael Parks gives one of his typically shifty, lethargic, mumbling performances, but in this case it was appropriate as his modern style sheriff symbolizes the complacency that technological progress can bring about.","finished_norm":["i","be","go","to","have","to","disagre","with","the","previou","comment","and","side","with","maltin","on","thi","on","thi","be","a","rate","excess","viciou","western","that","creak","and","groan","try","to","put","across","it","central","theme","of","the","wild","west","be","tame","and","kick","asid","by","the","steadi","march","of","time","it","would","like","to","be","in","the","tradit","of","butch","cassidi","and","the","sundanc","kid","but","lack","that","film","poignanc","and","charm","andrew","mclaglen","direct","be","limp","and","the","final","minut","or","so","be","a","real","botch","with","some","incomprehens","strategi","on","the","part","of","hero","charlton","heston","and","chri","mitchum","someon","give","me","a","holler","if","you","can","explain","to","me","why","thei","set","that","hillsid","on","fire","there","be","someth","callou","about","the","whole","treatment","of","the","rape","scene","and","the","woman","reaction","afterward","certainli","do","not","ring","true","coburn","be","plenti","nasti","a","the","half","bre","escap","convict","out","for","reveng","but","all","of","hi","fellow","escape","be","underdevelop","thei","re","like","bowl","pin","to","be","knock","down","on","by","on","a","the","stori","lurch","forward","michael","park","give","on","of","hi","typic","shifti","letharg","mumbl","perform","but","in","thi","case","it","be","appropri","a","hi","modern","styl","sheriff","symbol","the","complac","that","technolog","progress","can","bring","about"],"filtered":["go","disagre","previou","comment","side","maltin","thi","thi","rate","excess","viciou","western","creak","groan","try","put","across","central","theme","wild","west","tame","kick","asid","steadi","march","time","like","tradit","butch","cassidi","sundanc","kid","lack","film","poignanc","charm","andrew","mclaglen","direct","limp","final","minut","real","botch","incomprehens","strategi","part","hero","charlton","heston","chri","mitchum","someon","give","holler","explain","thei","set","hillsid","fire","someth","callou","whole","treatment","rape","scene","woman","reaction","afterward","certainli","ring","true","coburn","plenti","nasti","half","bre","escap","convict","reveng","hi","fellow","escape","underdevelop","thei","re","like","bowl","pin","knock","stori","lurch","forward","michael","park","give","hi","typic","shifti","letharg","mumbl","perform","thi","case","appropri","hi","modern","styl","sheriff","symbol","complac","technolog","progress","bring"],"filtered2":["go","disagre","previou","comment","side","maltin","rate","excess","viciou","western","creak","groan","try","put","across","central","theme","wild","west","tame","kick","asid","steadi","march","time","like","tradit","butch","cassidi","sundanc","kid","lack","poignanc","charm","andrew","mclaglen","direct","limp","final","minut","real","botch","incomprehens","strategi","part","hero","charlton","heston","chri","mitchum","someon","give","holler","explain","set","hillsid","fire","someth","callou","whole","treatment","rape","scene","woman","reaction","afterward","certainli","ring","true","coburn","plenti","nasti","half","bre","escap","convict","reveng","fellow","escape","underdevelop","re","like","bowl","pin","knock","stori","lurch","forward","michael","park","give","typic","shifti","letharg","mumbl","perform","case","appropri","modern","styl","sheriff","symbol","complac","technolog","progress","bring"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,8,17,19,30,36,53,59,61,68,70,80,102,105,109,111,114,139,156,159,183,202,206,250,280,288,304,375,380,389,395,425,466,503,534,551,613,638,699,729,746,769,784,797,869,871,888,935,936,1052,1084,1090,1107,1140,1263,1336,1410,1450,1504,1517,1644,1737,1748,1818,1919,2238,2296,2357,2502,2624,2817,2996,3032,3204,3287,3328,3347,3671,4059,4122,4176,4354,4505,4826,4846,4865,4869,4883,5414,6238,6471,6759,7133,8084],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,8,17,19,30,36,53,59,61,68,70,80,102,105,109,111,114,139,156,159,183,202,206,250,280,288,304,375,380,389,395,425,466,503,534,551,613,638,699,729,746,769,784,797,869,871,888,935,936,1052,1084,1090,1107,1140,1263,1336,1410,1450,1504,1517,1644,1737,1748,1818,1919,2238,2296,2357,2502,2624,2817,2996,3032,3204,3287,3328,3347,3671,4059,4122,4176,4354,4505,4826,4846,4865,4869,4883,5414,6238,6471,6759,7133,8084],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,2.6728839783437044,1.4680183469605717,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,1.8818517047392527,2.0064197866819473,2.094675786251684,1.9951803900462557,2.0875537101

{"value":"The acting, other reviews notwithstanding, was remarkably well-done. Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying, obnoxious Austrian climber quite well. Other acting is fine. The story could have been riveting, but somehow, it misses - one never really understands or cares for the characters shown, and so the story, which could have been quite dramatic, fails to draw in this audience.<br /><br />Beautiful scenery and cinematography, a remarkably dramatic true story, important events that shaped the world that we live in - but I could not, try as I might, involve myself in this story. As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan (I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation), I expected to *love* this flick - and yet, it left me cold.<br /><br />It could be a failing within myself, but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie - direction, scriptwriting, production, editing - somehow, they lost me. It's a shame, because it could have been wonderful.<br /><br />Good acting, dramatic story, beautifully shot - it should have been magnificent. It wasn't.

{"value":"This movie is a loose collection of unintelligible analogies and ill conceived plot devices.<br /><br />Movie history: The director of this film was a pervert who drove around town filming random women. When his wife discovered the film reels, he was forced to quickly contrive a story. He claimed he was making a movie called \"The brain that wouldn't die.\" Eventually, his wife demanded that he show her his \"so called movie.\" That night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and \"The Brain that wouldn't Die\" was born.<br /><br />I hate this movie! Plot Synopsis: The main character's fiancé is killed in a horrible car accident(that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs). He grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it. After reanimating the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers. That is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie. At the end, he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet. The monster appears with little to no explanation. However, the monster saves a hooker and I assume that they live happily ever after.<br /><br />Side notes: The end credit screen claims that the movie is called \"The Head that wouldn't Die\".<br

{"value":"Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from fairly good to unwatchable trash; and unfortunately, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter. The plot is just your average story of a witch, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock, who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it...etc etc. We then get a séance and one thing leads to another, and pretty soon the executed warlock is up to no good again. The plot is slow, painfully boring and the film constantly feels pointless. The characters string out reams of diatribe and it never serves the film in any way whatsoever. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me he should stick to acting because the dialogue is trite in the extreme, and only serves to make the film even more boring than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides dull direction here, which likes the dialogue does nothing to help the film. Sometimes crap films like this have a certain charm about them; but Horror Rises from the Tomb doesn't even have that.

{"value":"I love Alec Guinness. And that's saying a lot after this film. Actually, he is not bad in it. He just seems to stand aside, be urbane and his usual delightful self, but invest nada. It is obvious the girl he is matched with is a featherweight, even as an inexperienced young French girl. Sir Alec wouldn't have chosen her when he was young and very obviously isn't too happy about it now.<br /><br />The interesting character is the brooding brother of the odd \"Suzanne\", another twit. \"Donald\" aspires to be a French Heathcliffe and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery. What deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead? Was he in love with the father's mistress? Why did he jerk Suzanne's hair when she plotted to bring the disparate parts of this turkey together on the country estate? Or perhaps he had simply had enough of her obnoxious acting.<br /><br />The film would have been charming with Guiness and the \"older woman\" reminiscing and seeing Paris together. THAT would have been a great story! Two lovely experienced people in a beautiful city after the destruction of World War II. Why didn't somebody come up with that? I suggest watching Alec Guiness in \"The Card\", a little known but worthwhile

{"value":"My kid makes better videos than this! I feel ripped off of the $4.00 spent renting this thing! There is no date on the video case, apparently designed by Wellspring; and, what's even worse, there's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie! The only date given is 2002, leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he's getting a recent film.<br /><br />This movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made, that I'm amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video. It might be of interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960's, the anti-war, anti-establishment, tune-in, turn-on and drop out culture; but when you read the back of the video case, there's no hint that that is what you're getting. If you do make the mistake of renting it though, it is probably best viewed while on drugs, so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind while watching it, I can tell you that it doesn't get any better after the first scene; so, knowing that, I'm sure you'll be fast asleep long before the end.","finished_norm":["my","kid","make","well","video","than","thi","i","feel","rip","off","of","the","spend","rent","thi","thing","there","be","no","date","on","the","video","case","appar","design","by","wellspr","and","what","even","wrong","there","no","product","date","for","the","origin","film","list","anywher","in","the","movi","the","onli","date","give","be","lead","a","unsuspect","renter","to","believ","he","get","a","recent","filmbr","br","thi","movi","be","so","bad","from","a","standpoint","of","be","outdat","and","irrelev","for","ani","time","period","but","precis","when","it","be","make","that","i","be","amaz","that","anyon","would","take","the","time","and","expens","to","market","it","a","a","video","it","mai","be","of","interest","to","student","studi","the","countercultur","of","the","the","antiwar","antiestablish","tunein","turnon","and","drop","out","cultur","but","when","you","read","the","back","of","the","video","case","there","no","hint","that","that","be","what","you","re","get","if","you","do","make","the","mistak","of","rent","it","though","it","be","probabl","well","view","while","on","drug","so","that","your","mind","will","much","close","match","the","wavelength","of","the","mind","of","the","director","fassbind","and","fengler","regardless","of","your","state","of","mind","while","watch","it","i","can","tell","you","that","it","doe","not","get","ani","well","after","the","scene","so","know","that","i","be","sure","you","will","be","fast","asleep","long","befor","the","end"],"filtered":["kid","make","well","video","thi","feel","rip","spend","rent","thi","thing","date","video","case","appar","design","wellspr","even","wrong","product","date","origin","film","list","anywher","movi","onli","date","give","lead","unsuspect","renter","believ","get","recent","filmbr","br","thi","movi","bad","standpoint","outdat","irrelev","ani","time","period","precis","make","amaz","anyon","take","time","expens","market","video","mai","interest","student","studi","countercultur","antiwar","antiestablish","tunein","turnon","drop","cultur","read","back","video","case","hint","re","get","make","mistak","rent","though","probabl","well","view","drug","mind","much","close","match","wavelength","mind","director","fassbind","fengler","regardless","state","mind","watch","tell","doe","get","ani","well","scene","know","sure","fast","asleep","long","befor","end"],"filtered2":["kid","make","well","video","feel","rip","spend","rent","thing","date","video","case","appar","design","wellspr","even","wrong","product","date","origin","list","anywher","onli","date","give","lead","unsuspect","renter","believ","get","recent","filmbr","bad","standpoint","outdat","irrelev","ani","time","period","precis","make","amaz","anyon","take","time","expens","market","video","mai","interest","student","studi","countercultur","antiwar","antiestablish","tunein","turnon","drop","cultur","read","back","video","case","hint","re","get","make","mistak","rent","though","probabl","well","view","drug","mind","close","match","wavelength","mind","director","fassbind","fengler","regardless","state","mind","watch","tell","doe","get","ani","well","scene","know","sure","fast","asleep","long","befor","end"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,7,8,9,11,18,19,20,24,25,26,27,29,30,31,43,46,58,60,63,68,69,79,86,90,91,99,114,119,145,148,157,158,190,238,240,283,288,295,308,312,498,542,562,566,592,601,626,647,661,681,685,697,743,825,880,904,919,1171,1243,1292,1303,1346,1743,2856,2899,3503,3598,4078,5146,7273],"values":[3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,7,8,9,11,18,19,20,24,25,26,27,29,30,31,43,46,58,60,63,68,69,79,86,90,91,99,114,119,145,148,157,158,190,238,240,283,288,295,308,312,498,542,562,566,592,601,626,647,661,681,685,697,743,825,880,904,919,1171,1243,1292,1303,1346,1743,2856,2899,3503,3598,4078,5146,7273],"values":[1.8599301468615699,2.389902141215977,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,3.4960351200691706,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,2.600540117735859,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,1.8729627573220065,2.0064197866819473,2.127032521151058,1.9469506069506084,2.031112399272319,2.0477128419653545,2.0105926690411424,2.056430207256609,2.4433074195966826,2.1653408989309972,2.34599021453259,2.3018654096236517,2.3360150694757706,2.3106972614914807,2.558331832813986,7.791913928440488,11.066428510645427,2.7678802023081546,5.603124285389867,2.7910771187233068,2.8753661172782943,2.8824835850471584,3.386191741044285,3.44711191480

{"value":"Burt Kennedy used to be a very good director, but you'd never know it by this lumbering mess. Not only does this film look cheap, it IS cheap--most of the battle scenes are lifted from the far superior \"The Last Command\" from 1955, and that footage, shot 32 years previously, looks more contemporary than anything in this picture. The few action scenes that were actually shot for this movie are disorganized, confused and incompetent, looking just as shoddy as the rest of the picture. This has the look and feel of a bad student film (and the budget didn't seem to be a whole lot more). It moves like molasses, the acting for the most part is either over-the-top ham or under-the-top comatose--although Raul Julia comes off better than most of the rest of the cast--and it's chock full of annoying historical inaccuracies. On top of that, it's WAY too long. If you're going to make a boring film, do it in an hour or so and get it over with--don't stretch it out over three hours, like this one does. If you want to see a good movie about the Alamo, check out John Wayne's 1960 version, or even the 1955 film from which this movie stole its action scenes. Hard to believe it took six producers to make a movie this lousy.

{"value":"Despite some mildly thought-provoking oddities in the script and the film's overall curiosity value, Fury of the Wolfman emerges as a dull, uninteresting excursion into lycanthropy, saved only by the statuesque presence of villainess Perla Cristal. The rest of the players, including the hammy Naschy, are a complete write-off (though admittedly none are helped by often atrocious dubbing). Although the screenplay packs in enough variations on werewolf/Frankenstein/Dr Moreau themes to flesh out a dozen movies, the plot is so unevenly developed, the characterizations so feeble and the dialogue so verbosely ridiculous (at least in the English version), that any latent interest in the turgid proceedings is soon quashed.<br /><br />Zabalza's direction seems jerky, even amateurish. His staging is clumsy and ineffective. He is not helped by Villasenor's over-bright lighting. Even promising sets are so unatmospherically photographed that the director's few attempts to give the audience a fright are signaled far in advance<br /><br />Other credits fall into a similar

{"value":"This movie is so bad, you almost feel contaminated by it. Actually, there is a strong sense of relief when it's over, relief that you can now put the cassette back in the rewinder and RUSH this back to the video rental store before it contaminates the rest of your video collection. I jokingly suggested when we rented it that it looked like the kind of film where William Hurt would \"phone in\" his performance. I meant that he would not be trying very hard. But lo and behold, in a huge number of scenes in this film, Bill Hurt is actually ON THE PHONE! Our realization of this irony was the only pleasure we derived from this confusing mess. The cinematography and editing are murky and befuddled, the story is chaotic, and the soundtrack is barely audible. There is a very slight resemblance to \"Falling Down\", but that film had a boldly disturbing story-line, great writing and acting, and an engaging soundtrack. \"Contaminated Man\" is just some kind of broken down old European tourist trap, and watching it is like driving along some unfamiliar back road in an unknown country where you don't speak the language in a steady rain just after nightfall as the windshield keeps fogging up.

{"value":"I bought this DVD set, sight unseen, and wish I hadn't. The script needed some serious rewriting as it seems to be completely devoid of any feeling and pales in comparison to the book. The lighting is horrid, very unpolished, but if it was just that I could overlook it. The script doesn't focus enough on the characters...there is hardly an introduction to various characters making it a tad difficult to distinguish who is who(especially in the planes--no idea who dies when).<br /><br />I have long felt that the key to a good film is in getting the audience to care about the characters; if you don't have that you don't have anything. There was no focus on the characters at all--you never got to know them--who they were, what they liked..what made them do the things that they do. The series is 5 hours long and split up into 6 parts...I bet you are wondering what they did with all this time if they didn't detail the characters---they put a lot of filler in it....I will say at least an entire hour is spent watching them land and take off in their planes LOL (I mean do we really need to see that over and over again???). I would have given this a much higher rating had they just improved our knowledge of the characters.","finished_norm":["i","bui","thi","dvd","set","sight","unseen","and","wish","i","have","not","the","script","ne","some","seriou","rewrit","a","it","seem","to","be","complet","devoid","of","ani","feel","and","pale","in","comparison","to","the","book","the","light","be","horrid","veri","unpolish","but","if","it","be","just","that","i","can","overlook","it","the","script","doe","not","focu","enough","on","the","charactersther","be","hardli","a","introduct","to","variou","charact","make","it","a","tad","difficult","to","distinguish","who","be","whoespeci","in","the","planesno","idea","who","die","whenbr","br","i","have","long","feel","that","the","kei","to","a","good","film","be","in","get","the","audienc","to","care","about","the","charact","if","you","do","not","have","that","you","do","not","have","anyth","there","be","no","focu","on","the","charact","at","allyou","never","get","to","know","themwho","thei","be","what","thei","likedwhat","make","them","do","the","thing","that","thei","do","the","seri","be","hour","long","and","split","up","into","partsi","bet","you","be","wonder","what","thei","do","with","all","thi","time","if","thei","do","not","detail","the","charactersthei","put","a","lot","of","filler","in","iti","will","sai","at","littl","a","entir","hour","be","spend","watch","them","land","and","take","off","in","their","plane","lol","i","mean","do","we","realli","ne","to","see","that","over","and","over","again","i","would","have","give","thi","a","much","high","rate","have","thei","just","improv","our","knowledg","of","the","charact"],"filtered":["bui","thi","dvd","set","sight","unseen","wish","script","ne","seriou","rewrit","seem","complet","devoid","ani","feel","pale","comparison","book","light","horrid","veri","unpolish","overlook","script","doe","focu","enough","charactersther","hardli","introduct","variou","charact","make","tad","difficult","distinguish","whoespeci","planesno","idea","die","whenbr","br","long","feel","kei","good","film","get","audienc","care","charact","anyth","focu","charact","allyou","never","get","know","themwho","thei","thei","likedwhat","make","thing","thei","seri","hour","long","split","partsi","bet","wonder","thei","thi","time","thei","detail","charactersthei","put","lot","filler","iti","sai","littl","entir","hour","spend","watch","land","take","plane","lol","mean","realli","ne","see","give","thi","much","high","rate","thei","improv","knowledg","charact"],"filtered2":["bui","dvd","set","sight","unseen","wish","script","ne","seriou","rewrit","seem","complet","devoid","ani","feel","pale","comparison","book","light","horrid","veri","unpolish","overlook","script","doe","focu","enough","charactersther","hardli","introduct","variou","charact","make","tad","difficult","distinguish","whoespeci","planesno","idea","die","whenbr","long","feel","kei","good","get","audienc","care","charact","anyth","focu","charact","allyou","never","get","know","themwho","likedwhat","make","thing","hour","long","split","partsi","bet","wonder","time","detail","charactersthei","put","lot","filler","iti","littl","entir","hour","spend","watch","land","take","plane","lol","mean","realli","ne","see","give","high","rate","improv","knowledg","charact"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,8,10,13,14,15,18,26,27,29,30,31,35,42,43,72,77,88,93,99,103,104,109,110,123,151,159,168,174,175,198,202,205,211,247,283,293,347,353,399,493,619,665,740,803,870,942,1088,1117,1236,1280,1451,1526,1631,1898,2226,2288,2322,2437,2449,3224,3632,3719,3764,4011,4704,7024],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,8,10,13,14,15,18,26,27,29,30,31,35,42,43,72,77,88,93,99,103,104,109,110,123,151,159,168,174,175,198,202,205,211,247,283,293,347,353,399,493,619,665,740,803,870,942,1088,1117,1236,1280,1451,1526,1631,1898,2226,2288,2322,2437,2449,3224,3632,3719,3764,4011,4704,7024],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,4.495548096411346,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.463169012899134,1.6219954307453837,3.321622407243643,1.9209463754160525,3.8927804517536475,2.0317223413467334,2.035389827120098,4.112860414513218,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.125691139326857,4.2580959472608155,2.2619070973220485,2.8002454868101863,2.300267965194495,2.4894767118610357,4.912565156919632,2.3791142619576227,2.5439726117360975,2.597304642813496,2.571852579609833,2.5687161421197025,2.7303758068497004,2.7678802023081546,2.9012296278682137,3.0151989841543516,3.0266839340212486,3.129115117668582,3.34225

{"value":"Greenaway's films pose as clever, erudite and innovative. Yet his style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the World War 1 era of film-making: the frame composition, use of mid-shot, the static camera. It may be well to rub against mainstream movies with this style but it is not new. Perhaps like that other \"innovator\", TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could.<br /><br />Yet Greenaway's biggest failing is that he cannot write. His dialog and even plot structure is mechanical and logical but without the vitality of another dramatic logician, Brecht. Where this weakness is most apparent is in his humor, which is poised and logical, so the joke is dead before it's delivered. The result is tedium: if it's not funny, it has failed: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond. Perhaps the well-read director could learn something from Freud on humor.<br /><br />Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like clones.

{"value":"There will be a time where kids will have grown up without ever seeing the one and only Bugs Bunny kiss (technically) another man on the lips. There will be a time where it won't be Duck or Rabbit season. There will be a time where the Tazmanian Devil will be dubbed politically incorrect.<br /><br />But so help me now is not that time.<br /><br />Nobody really wants an 'EXTREME' version of our beloved Loony characters. Whoever it is in marketing who comes up with \"Corn Nuts: Corn gone wrong\" and \"Extreme Doritos\" and evidently this festering turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or whatever doesn't mean they know jack about kids.<br /><br />I think that they're doing a disservice to children, depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time. This show disgusts me, and it's not just the dated artwork or terrible dialogue. They misuse good voice talent, like Phil Lamarr, Michael Clarke Duncan, Candi Milo, and so many others.

{"value":"The premise of this movie is revealed on the DVD box. A textile worker develops a miracle fabric that doesn't degrade. But the movie fails to get on with it. Instead it pads for 45 minutes, noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery. Since audiences don't benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out, it's a strange choice: the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic. Once the fabric is discovered, the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs, and blue-collar co-workers want the invention squelched, leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements; inventing the chemical, and running from oppressors.<br /><br />I can't understand why anyone would describe this as comedy. The tone isn't funny or comical. It's more like serious social criticism of the day: that capitalism warps both supply chains and production. Which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. Yes, that's probably true, but without some toying with an attitude towards that fact, the movie is simply an earnest argument. You'll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any here.<br /><br />This is more like a British Meet John Doe (Meet Nigel Doe
