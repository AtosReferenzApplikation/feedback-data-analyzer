{"value":"If you haven't seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, you haven't. A contest like 'make your own horror movie in one day' could not possibly come up with a entry than this outrage of an insult on any viewer's intelligence. Mr. Sheets forgot a story, a plot, proper dialog, the fact that people need some BASIC acting talents and the credited lighting designer obviously forgot to show up. It seems to be recorded on the crummiest of handycams, and copied on even worse equipment. Make-up effect consist of black mascara for the zombies and yoghurt being poured over people's heads in order to simulate their skin melting. This is nothing more than a home-movie, and a really bad one as well. Only fun to watch for the friends, familymembers and neighbours that were willing to show up for the filming. I cannot for the life of me understand why this mockery of a product is listed in ANY serious film magazine or website - I have home-movies of wedding parties that are way better and more interesting. A total waste of time, money and energy. The sequel ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just more of the same rubbish.","finished_norm":["if","you","have","not","see","zombi","bloodbath","you","have","not","a","contest","like","make","your","own","horror","movi","in","on","dai","can","not","possibli","come","up","with","a","entri","than","thi","outrag","of","a","insult","on","ani","viewer","intellig","mr","sheet","forget","a","stori","a","plot","proper","dialog","the","fact","that","peopl","ne","some","basic","act","talent","and","the","credit","light","design","obvious","forget","to","show","up","it","seem","to","be","record","on","the","crummi","of","handycam","and","copi","on","even","wrong","equip","makeup","effect","consist","of","black","mascara","for","the","zombi","and","yoghurt","be","pour","over","peopl","head","in","order","to","simul","their","skin","melt","thi","be","noth","much","than","a","homemovi","and","a","realli","bad","on","a","good","onli","fun","to","watch","for","the","friend","familymemb","and","neighbour","that","be","will","to","show","up","for","the","film","i","cannot","for","the","life","of","me","understand","why","thi","mockeri","of","a","product","be","list","in","ani","seriou","film","magazin","or","websit","i","have","homemovi","of","wed","parti","that","be","wai","well","and","much","interest","a","total","wast","of","time","monei","and","energi","the","sequel","zombi","bloodbath","ii","be","just","much","of","the","same","rubbish"],"filtered":["see","zombi","bloodbath","contest","like","make","horror","movi","dai","possibli","come","entri","thi","outrag","insult","ani","viewer","intellig","mr","sheet","forget","stori","plot","proper","dialog","fact","peopl","ne","basic","act","talent","credit","light","design","obvious","forget","show","seem","record","crummi","handycam","copi","even","wrong","equip","makeup","effect","consist","black","mascara","zombi","yoghurt","pour","peopl","head","order","simul","skin","melt","thi","noth","much","homemovi","realli","bad","good","onli","fun","watch","friend","familymemb","neighbour","show","film","life","understand","thi","mockeri","product","list","ani","seriou","film","magazin","websit","homemovi","wed","parti","wai","well","much","interest","total","wast","time","monei","energi","sequel","zombi","bloodbath","ii","much","rubbish"],"filtered2":["see","zombi","bloodbath","contest","like","make","horror","dai","possibli","come","entri","outrag","insult","ani","viewer","intellig","mr","sheet","forget","stori","plot","proper","dialog","fact","peopl","ne","basic","act","talent","credit","light","design","obvious","forget","show","seem","record","crummi","handycam","copi","even","wrong","equip","makeup","effect","consist","black","mascara","zombi","yoghurt","pour","peopl","head","order","simul","skin","melt","noth","homemovi","realli","bad","good","onli","fun","watch","friend","familymemb","neighbour","show","life","understand","mockeri","product","list","ani","seriou","magazin","websit","homemovi","wed","parti","wai","well","interest","total","wast","time","monei","energi","sequel","zombi","bloodbath","ii","rubbish"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,8,9,11,13,17,20,21,23,25,27,28,32,33,34,35,49,60,75,83,89,97,106,110,126,132,161,184,190,208,212,229,259,268,276,279,286,341,353,356,357,372,387,432,439,493,558,601,603,681,709,747,828,850,960,1020,1098,1169,1374,1497,1617,1618,1739,1908,1978,2303,2369,2809,2992,3258,4189,4207,4575,5822,6000,6569],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,8,9,11,13,17,20,21,23,25,27,28,32,33,34,35,49,60,75,83,89,97,106,110,126,132,161,184,190,208,212,229,259,268,276,279,286,341,353,356,357,372,387,432,439,493,558,601,603,681,709,747,828,850,960,1020,1098,1169,1374,1497,1617,1618,1739,1908,1978,2303,2369,2809,2992,3258,4189,4207,4575,5822,6000,6569],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,2.729695454751562,1.2796387880827016,2.600540117735859,3.0904588387038183,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.6920303308087352,1.838176641236591,1.9742250248702675,2.292318797740072,1.9940046109572438,2.0545557924622586,2.159084361316692,2.1290479736304078,2.2391270689902285,2.253494045787767,2.4323182980210873,2.496249838866882,2.558331832813986,2.6289494000279396,2.5983793339432615,2.8432628718938773,2.7464553122240485,11.023986438639847,2.7884729505849193,2.7910771187233068,2.780700890737216,2.933776879434709,3.0266839340212486,3.028335462059722,3.2829611516442836,6.063293446726755,3.360519385990158,3.2350852035

{"value":"Honestly I can't understand why this movie rates so well here, nor why Bakshi himself thought it was his finest film. I'm a huge fan of Bakshi's earlier work - particularly 'Heavy Traffic' and 'Wizards', but frankly 'Wizards' (1977) was the last good film he made. After that he turned to the mainstream, beginning with the diabolical 'Lord of the Rings' and then knuckling down with sword and sorcery heavyweight Frank Frazetta, for 'Fire and Ice'.<br /><br />What can I say? The story is puerile, the animation is TV quality - I insist that it's considerably worse than his 70's stuff - and whereas 'Wizards' had real imagination, quirkiness, some gorgeous background art, and an underground, adult sensibility, 'Fire and Ice' is just designed for 14 year old boys, and has the intellectual clout of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.<br /><br />Yes, if you liked the Gor books, you might like this. In my view though, this was just another blip in the slide in quality after 'Wizards' from which Bakshi never recovered (though he's done some decent TV stuff fairly recently)<br /><br />4.5 out of

{"value":"An interesting idea (four African American women crushed under society's boot heel take their revenge by robbing banks) is ruined by F. Gary Gray's horribly slow direction and an excruciating script (by Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier) full of unintentionally funny moments. Instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them, Gray, Bufford and Lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow notions of operatic tragedy. It's melodrama at its worst. Gray has his actors linger over every tired line and John Carter's lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack, choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the performers' bemused faces. And bemused they are: although actors such as Jada Pinkett, Kimberly Elise and Vivica A. Fox have some raw talent (Queen Latifah is the fourth and as an actress she's an excellent rapper), they need a surer hand than Gray's to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera.

{"value":"OK well i found this movie in my dads old pile of movies and it looked pretty good from the cover but the movie actually sucked!! OK the first story with the swimmer was pretty good but it took a while to get into, then the one with the boy was completely retarded! It wasn't even scary! His dream sounds like a little kid's bedtime story. Then the news girls one was completely retarded too. I'm sure someones going to call up the news guy and ask him to go out with you. But that one ended cool where she stabbed him and she was in the hospital and she saw him on t.v and he said all that junk to her. Next was that pretty gay story about the guy who brought back the dead people..OMG its so stupid I'm not even going to say any more about it.The last one was the best. It wasn't that scary but the idea of the story was pretty cool..uh yeah the girl gets possessed and she kills all her classmates or something.

{"value":"The story: Young-goon is a girl whose family has a history of mental illness. She ends up in a mental institution after she starts believing that she is in fact a cyborg. In the institution she meets Park Il-sun, a young man who develops a bond with her.<br /><br />If you're reading this you probably already know how talented Chan-wook Park is. But 'I'm A Cyborg...' is a big departure from familiar, and (sadly) stronger territory. I'm a big fan of any film or story which is attempting to do something different. God knows, we all get subjected to enough crap at our local cinemas. The main point about the movie I need to say is, that it fails to say anything about mental illness, or create a characters that you care about.<br /><br />This story has to be one of the weirdest things I've seen in years...but weird isn't enough. There's no heart to the movie...just surrealism and confusion. Confusion does seem to be the main theme of the movie.

{"value":"end of the world looks like a good movie on the box cover but be warned its bad.being a big fan of mega star actor Christopher lee i was fooled. like tentacles(77)a good cast does not mean it'll be a good film.the beginning looks promising then it turns to tedium,many parts of the movie are too dark to see whats going on.the rest of the cast is shown briefly like;Lew ayres,dean Jagger,and MacDonald Carey as a security guard.i would expect better from Charles band who made good fun movies like the re-animater and dolls.i heard Christopher lee was tricked into making this film.he was told his co stars were going to be Jose ferrer,john carridine,and dean Jagger.well dean Jagger is there but the other two never made it(lucky them)if you make a movie about the end of the world use a bigger budget and better storyline.dean Jagger went on to do two good movies afterwards;alligator(80)and game of death(79) sue Lyon(Lolita)is also in the movie minus her lollipop.if you

{"value":"I firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a \"spoof\". Crispin Glover is very serious about his film. He personally introduced the film at the screening I saw in Chicago. He had worked on the film for years and it is the first in an intended trilogy. \"What is it?\" is Crispin Glover's attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by Herzog, Lynch etc.<br /><br />I had heard rumor of this film years ago \"epic porno movie with all down-syndrome cast directed by crispin glover\". When it finally came out i watched the trailer on-line and read the synopsis and i was foaming at the mouth with anticipation. ...I went to chicago to see it and it was a major disappointment. If he took out the goofy sh*t, such as the pot-smoking grandma, and the dancing dolls, he would be left with something much better, but only about 10 minutes long.<br /><br />In other words just watch the trailer, be entertained, and leave it at that.

{"value":"This was awful. Andie Macdowell is a terrible actress. So wooden she makes a rocking horse look like it could do a better job. But then remember that turn in Four Weddings, equally as excruciating. Another film that portrays England as full of Chocolate box cottages, and village greens. I mean that school, how many schools apart from maybe Hogwarts look like that? The twee police station looked like the set from Heartbeat ( a nauseating British series set in the 60s).This film just couldn't make its mind up what it wanted to be- a comedy or a serious examination of the undercurrents in women's friendships. If it had stuck to the former then the graveyard sex scenes and the highly stupid storming of the wedding might just have worked( i say just). But those scenes just didn't work with the tragedy in the second half. I also find it implausible that Kate would ever speak to Molly again after her terrible behaviour. A final note- what is a decent actress like Staunton doing in this pile of poo? Not to mention Anna Chancellor.

{"value":"This TV film tells the story of extrovert Frannie suddenly returning to Silk Hope to visit friends and family, but unaware of her mother's death. Her sister runs the family home, but is intending to sell it and move away with her new husband. Frannie strongly objects to the idea, and vows to keep the family heirloom as it were, by getting a job and maintaining responsibility.<br /><br />In comes handsome Ruben and the two soon fall in love (as you do), and it's from this point that I sort of lost interest....<br /><br />There is more to Farrah Fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks, she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it - and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like Extremities and Small Sacrificies - a great performance from the legendary Charlie's Angel.<br /><br />Silk Hope is the type of film that never shies away from its cheap and cheerful TV image, and you know there was a limit to the budget, but it's not the worst film ever made.

{"value":"The funniest scene of this movie is probably when our saviours get their medals and plaques and whatnot. So the basic idea is, the police outnumbers these gangsters by like a million to one, but they're powerless because the villains' guns are just a bit bigger. I guess police ammo just kinda bounces of. They decided to shoot this movie in documentary style with fake interviews and all and seriously, what is wrong with these guys? They're talking like they were armed with rolled-up newspapers. Okay I admit, it's probably still dangerous to be in the line of the fire, even when the situation is so much to your advantage, but don't go nuts. And why the hell did it take 44 minutes to solve everything anyway? I'd say that's a very long time when you have them surrounded and you're allowed to shoot. They're like ten ft. away, they hit absolutely nothing. Then they go and buy bigger guns themselves to increase their heroism. And then yeah, there you have it, one of the cops actually hits someone. Bullet was probably diverted by a lamp post or something.

It has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling - that Aussie fellow really is something, and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the \"art\".

{"value":"Being a Film studies graduate I would like to think that I have seen a diverse range of films, some good and some bad, but I would have to say that 'Summer rain' is by far the worse film I have ever seen! I chose the film in the hope that it was going to be a great British classic such as 'Secrets and Lies' or 'Lockstock' but oh no this was so bad that my flat mates and I ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script (reminded me of a bad 'theatre in education' school production). The main characters Michelle and Gary began to annoy us from the start. 'Michelle' the main character who lives with her two friends has the type of face that you would never get tired of slapping and Gary was so wet (he kept breaking down in tears every 5 minutes) that by the end of the film I really didn't give a damn about either of them. All I could think was ' I paid £3 for this pile'. I have never written a review before but after watching this film it has spurred me on to warn people of this disastrous production. So please avoid at all costs.

{"value":"Absolutely one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! It starts off badly and just deteriorates. Katherine Heigl is woefully miscast in a Lolita role and Leo Grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character. The only cast-member with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore, who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role. The script is dire, the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double-decker bus through! It is also the most sexist movie I have ever seen! Katherine Heigl's character is completely unsympathetic. She's seen as an evil, wanton seductress who lures the poor, innocent married man to cheat on his wife. It is implied throughout the movie that she's underage, and the message that accompanies that plot-strand just beggars belief! At the end, she isn't even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who's obviously (ha!) become demented with rage and guilt, but the script allows him to kill himself, thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere. Horrible.

{"value":"I saw this by accident one lazy summer afternoon. It was playing on the family programming channel of HBO. At first I was drawn in, by what I thought was a Disney animation. But then, after a few minutes, I found myself searching for the remote, so I could find the 'INFO BUTTON', to find out what in the world was on my TV. I have nothing against Harvey F., I enjoy him in many of his films, but one thing he is not, is a voice-over artist. Sure he has one of the more unique voices in Hollywood, but it works only as a part of a bigger visual package. Attaching his voice to a cute duck made watching somewhat difficult. As for the rest of the cast, uninspired. I suppose working on this film didn't appeal to the really good voice over talent out there.<br /><br />So, weak voice talent, strong animation...who was this film targeting? Gay adolescent ducks? I don't get it. Is there really such a dearth of role-models for young up and coming homosexuals, that we must resort to animated ducks? Cute story, and like the title, this movie I found hard to love, just like an ugly

{"value":"Up until the last few minutes of the movie, I would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars. However, the ending is so terrible and \"Hollywoodized\" that it completely undermines the first 80% of the movie.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles. The Captain, Gene Hackman, is all for launching, while his first officer, Denzel Washington, is in favor of confirming the launch orders first. The problem is, to launch BOTH the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys. Hackman is determined to launch and Washington stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub. Eventually, the mistake is discovered and the missiles are not launched. Cool. However, here comes the part that just doesn't ring true. After they are back on land and go before a review board, Washington and Hackman (who'd just spent half the movie trying to kill each other) shake hands and are all buddy buddy! Huh?!

{"value":"If I were to create a movie thermometer, this movie would be absolute zero. Out of ten stars, I would rate it as follows:<br /><br />Plot: zero stars Video quality: zero stars Sound Quality: zero stars Acting: zero stars<br /><br />It is as though high school students got together one afternoon with a camera, made up a plot and shot a movie. It is so lacking in any artistic value that I'd rather watch kids walking around a high school than watch this movie.<br /><br />HOWEVER, something is to be said for the abysymal depths. The \"shootout\" in the staircase is one of the most train-wreck funny scenes ever. First of all, the combatants simply wave plastic guns at each other, jerking their arms back and forth to simulate recoil. The pair actually \"duck\" each other's non-existent bullets. No squibs, no sparks, no blanks, just waving spraypainted squirtguns around. If you want to see two grown men play \"actor\", give it a spin someday... after you have cleaned the fridge, combed the carpet, polished all of the doorknobs, raked the gravel, straightened the books

{"value":"There aren't enough gay-themed movies and there aren't enough `coming out' movies. Every one is a welcome addition to the genre. Although the production values are high(the movie `looks' good, Matthias Freihof (Philipp) looks REAL good in a pair of jeans) this is a bad one. It is a period piece: gay life under an oppressive regime(East Berlin, 1989) a life that seems 40 years behind the west. In a way we're seeing our own history; what it might have been like for gays in the 40's and 50's here(it often reminded me of `Last Exit to Brooklyn :the book not the film).But it is unremittingly depressing and SLOW in a contrived way that evoked an old SCTV send up of Ingmar Bergman. It is so sloppily edited I wonder if the director just didn't hack at random. Yes, it is a miracle that this was filmed and released before The Wall came down and yes, life behind the `Curtain' was hard for gay people. A good director could have shown all that without stupefying the audience.

{"value":"... or maybe it just IS this bad. The plot is a cheap rehash of the first, which is weird, since it's supposed to be a prequel, not a sequel. Pretty much the entire movie seems like a cheap remake of the first, with scenes mimicking the things that happened in the first, only a lot more ridiculous and unlikely. Where the first had a great cast, this one consist of B-list actors and rejects. The acting is mostly horrendously bad. Half of the good lines in the movie are taken directly from the first, as is nearly every major character, including the ones who weren't in the first movie. I realize this was made up by a TV series pilot episode, but that's no excuse. They didn't have to turn the (bad) footage into a movie. Only one thing is marginally good, and that's the erotic sequences. However, as these are nowhere near as good as the ones in the first, even this isn't raising it above a rating of 1. If you have a chance to see it for free, and you're a straight guy, it could be worth checking out, if you want something erotic that isn't porn.

{"value":"In the 60's, having as the background the rehearsal and recording of \"Sympathy for the Devil\" in the classic album \"Beggar's Banquet\" by the revolutionary bad boy Rolling Stones  Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Bill Wyman and Brian Jones  plus Marianne Faithful, Godard discloses other contemporary revolutionary and ideological movements  the Black Power through the Black Panthers, the feminism, the communism, the fascism - entwined with the reading of a cheap pulp political novel divided in the chapters: \"The Stones Rolling; \"Outside Black Novel\"; \"Sight and Sound\"; \"All About Eve\"; \"The Heart of Occident\"; \"Inside Black Syntax\"; and, \"Under the Stones the Beach\".<br /><br />\"Sympathy for the Devil\" is another pretentious and boring mess of the uneven director Jean-Luc Godard. The narrative and the footages are awful, but fortunately I love the Stones and \"Sympathy for the Devil\" and it is nice to see them in the beginning of their careers; otherwise this documentary would be unbearable.

{"value":"Roommates Sugar and Bobby Lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on. All that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family.<br /><br />This one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that I started feeling bad for poor Hank Worden who truly deserved much MUCH better. As much as I didn't like \"Barracuda\" (that's on the same DVD) I have to admit that this film makes that one look like Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Eye Candy: one pair of tits (they might belong to Kirsten Baker) <br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />Dark Sky DVD Extras: Vintage ads for various drive-in food; and Trailers for \"Bonnie's Kids\" (features nudity), \"the Centerfold Girls\", \"Part-time Wife\" (features nudity), \"Psychic Killer\", & \"Eaten Alive\".

{"value":"I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP's. And this one surely is an OOP. One year after The Exorcist she's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of Blair never broke out, she never became a mega star. That's one of the reason's many of her films are OOP. She gives a good performance in this movie. It's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn't have any friends. Played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14, that's funny. The movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity. In most editions it's cut out, why, I don't know, no blood is involved, okay, Blair is butt naked but nothing is shown, no T&A so nothing to offend people. But the movie is slow, extremely slow. It doesn't happy normally to me but I almost felt asleep. It's just about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows, no gore no nothing. Why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me. If you're a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it otherwise leave it as it

{"value":"Let me give a quick summery of the film: A rotten, rude kid named Max stumbles upon a radio that contains Kazaam: a rapping genie. Like all genies, he grants 3 wishes but, being good natured, also helps Max with his personal life, as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime. During all this, Kazaam raps from time to time, (also showcasing Shaq's dismal rap skills).<br /><br />This movie proves what we all know: Athletes need to stick to sports. I admit that it never looked like an Oscar-worthy movie, but EVERYTHING about this waste of film is horrible. The characters are either unlikable or stupid, the plot is not even worth mentioning, the dialog is a joke, and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem. Hell, even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke. I know that the movie only drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big (no pun intended) at the time. I honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time.

{"value":"This bogus journey never comes close to matching the wit and craziness of the excellent adventure these guys took in their first movie. This installment tries to veer away from its prequel to capture some new blood out of the joke, but it takes a wrong turn and journeys nowhere interesting or funny.<br /><br />There's almost a half-hour wasted on showing the guys doing a rock concert (and lots of people watching on \"free TV\"--since when does that happen?) Surely the script writer could have done something more creative; look at how all the random elements of the first movie were neatly tied up together by a converging them at the science presentation. Not in this film, which pretty much ended the Bill & Ted franchise. The joke was over.<br /><br />The Grim Reaper is tossed into the mix, for whatever reason. This infusion, like the whole plot, is done poorly and lacks sparks for comedy or audience involvement. There's a ZZ Top impression, hammered in for no reason. There's lights, smoke, mirrors, noise. But nothing really creative or funny.<br /><br />Skip this bogus

{"value":"I'd give it a 2/10.<br /><br />I was really, really disappointed.<br /><br />The storyline was poorly developed, for instance, the incidents were too short and brief, hence the moral was not clearly brought out. I thought Brenda Song did a fine job, but Shin Koyamada seemed to have a difficult time handling his role. I could see the need to put in western elements in the show, however, there are certain parts, where Chinese elements were needed too! The villain for example. His physical appearance resembled a robot, instead of something out of the Chinese culture. The final and the worst flaw, were the incorrect, and distorted facts placed in the show.<br /><br />Others may point out that this is a 'Kid's show' and hence, there is no need for the such high standards. However, there are other Disney shows, such as Mu Lan, which have been much better in terms of story development and presentation.<br /><br />In conclusion, I feel that Disney movies should be better researched and better planned. A good show is not enough with just a series of martial arts moves to depend on.","finished_norm":["i","have","give","it","a","br","br","i","be","realli","realli","disappointedbr","br","the","storylin","be","poorli","develop","for","instanc","the","incid","be","too","short","and","brief","henc","the","moral","be","not","clearli","bring","out","i","think","brenda","song","do","a","fine","job","but","shin","koyamada","seem","to","have","a","difficult","time","handl","hi","role","i","can","see","the","ne","to","put","in","western","elem","in","the","show","howev","there","be","certain","part","where","chines","elem","be","ne","too","the","villain","for","exampl","hi","physic","appear","resembl","a","robot","instead","of","someth","out","of","the","chines","cultur","the","final","and","the","wrong","flaw","be","the","incorrect","and","distort","fact","place","in","the","showbr","br","other","mai","point","out","that","thi","be","a","kid","show","and","henc","there","be","no","ne","for","the","such","high","standard","howev","there","be","other","disnei","show","such","a","mu","lan","which","have","be","much","well","in","term","of","stori","develop","and","presentationbr","br","in","conclus","i","feel","that","disnei","movi","should","be","well","research","and","well","plan","a","good","show","be","not","enough","with","just","a","seri","of","martial","art","move","to","depend","on"],"filtered":["give","br","br","realli","realli","disappointedbr","br","storylin","poorli","develop","instanc","incid","short","brief","henc","moral","clearli","bring","think","brenda","song","fine","job","shin","koyamada","seem","difficult","time","handl","hi","role","see","ne","put","western","elem","show","howev","certain","part","chines","elem","ne","villain","exampl","hi","physic","appear","resembl","robot","instead","someth","chines","cultur","final","wrong","flaw","incorrect","distort","fact","place","showbr","br","mai","point","thi","kid","show","henc","ne","high","standard","howev","disnei","show","mu","lan","much","well","term","stori","develop","presentationbr","br","conclus","feel","disnei","movi","well","research","well","plan","good","show","enough","seri","martial","art","move","depend"],"filtered2":["give","realli","realli","disappointedbr","storylin","poorli","develop","instanc","incid","short","brief","henc","moral","clearli","bring","think","brenda","song","fine","job","shin","koyamada","seem","difficult","time","handl","role","see","ne","put","western","elem","show","howev","certain","part","chines","elem","ne","villain","exampl","physic","appear","resembl","robot","instead","someth","chines","cultur","final","wrong","flaw","incorrect","distort","fact","place","showbr","mai","point","kid","show","henc","ne","high","standard","howev","disnei","show","mu","lan","well","term","stori","develop","presentationbr","conclus","feel","disnei","well","research","well","plan","good","show","enough","martial","art","move","depend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,12,13,17,20,25,28,30,35,43,46,53,61,66,93,97,110,113,114,128,152,156,159,164,170,211,250,272,275,289,307,320,328,382,398,464,479,494,515,520,581,616,769,774,803,841,858,878,880,923,945,956,970,1053,1154,1179,1186,1216,1386,1672,1969,2262,2455,3251,3439,3567,3928,3982],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,12,13,17,20,25,28,30,35,43,46,53,61,66,93,97,110,113,114,128,152,156,159,164,170,211,250,272,275,289,307,320,328,382,398,464,479,494,515,520,581,616,769,774,803,841,858,878,880,923,945,956,970,1053,1154,1179,1186,1216,1386,1672,1969,2262,2455,3251,3439,3567,3928,3982],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.2770536940105968,3.4960351200691706,1.2796387880827016,6.180917677407637,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,1.7003182735607676,1.8818517047392527,1.929723173391612,2.035389827120098,2.0545557924622586,6.387143920891223,4.3043565130405606,2.4433074195966826,2.3409902041158843,2.3131195476980753,2.3451551414151686,2.300267965194495,2.3930275298746078,2.4214486257841834,2.5687161421197025,2.6812935439488212,2.8028805344481915,2.7832848715031413,2.8282659991423613,2.8767855639325206,5.87659672830711,3.1550424959247185,3.235085203598255,3.143848349181566,3.2872346624216657,6.721038771980316,3.3243163373261977,3.3956930001684253,3.5614461306151473,3.530930586689197,3.5173618574831282,4.0536665665501035,3.753391311073496,3.7636829971100436,8.60733041033498,3.8767358583910254,4.067587905068712,4.110553940952155,3.9911462095687695,3.9782428047328615,3.969732115064953,4.086456389373095,4.067587905068712,4.589376833631972,4.390138803171316,4.2574141875167335,4.280272325592784,4.715065048795469,10.258997653772786,4.8692157286227

{"value":"ALIEN LOVE ( As this movie is known in Britain ) is a very strange movie . I don`t mean that it`s an esoteric art house movie in the style of Peter Greenaway or Derek Jarman , I mean it`s a TVM with swearing , sex , some really good T&A , a bad script and a very retro feel . You can just imagine someone like John Hughes directing this ten years earlier , though of course he would have cut out the T&A <br /><br />Going back to the bad script , one of the problems is that few of the characters have any type of motivation especially Amanda . Why does she pick up Connie at the bar ? Just so she could meet an alien ? Do you see what I mean about retro ? ET , SHORT CIRCUIT and a whole lot of other movies from the mid 1980s had this type of plot with most of them being more defined and convincing than the one seen here . The storyline continues to follow an ill defined , unconvincing and illogical path <br /><br />That said I did find ALIEN LOVE watchable and not only down to the T&A on display .

So another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice.<br /><br />To conclude my story, I really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs, on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it. By doing this you won't waste 90 minutes of your life, as I did.","finished_norm":["so","the","other","night","i","decid","to","watch","tale","from","the","hollywood","hill","natica","jackson","or","power","passion","murder","a","it","be","call","in","holland","when","i","bui","the","film","i","notic","that","michel","pfeiffer","be","star","in","it","and","i","think","that","have","to","sai","someth","about","the","qualiti","unfortun","it","didntbr","br","the","plot","of","the","film","be","realli","confus","there","be","two","stori","line","run","simultan","dure","the","film","onli","thei","have","noth","in","common","throughout","the","entir","movi","i","be","wait","for","the","moment","thi","two","stori","line","would","come","togeth","so","the","plot","would","be","clear","to","me","but","it","still","hasntbr","br","the","titl","of","the","film","sai","the","film","will","be","about","natica","jackson","good","it","be","sometim","like","sai","the","film","cover","two","differ","stori","and","the","part","about","natica","jackson","be","the","short","so","anoth","titl","for","thi","movi","would","not","be","a","wrong","choicebr","br","to","conclud","my","stori","i","realli","recommend","that","you","leav","thi","movi","where","it","belong","on","the","shelf","in","the","store","on","a","place","nobodi","can","see","it","by","do","thi","you","wo","not","wast","minut","of","your","life","a","i","do"],"filtered":["night","decid","watch","tale","hollywood","hill","natica","jackson","power","passion","murder","call","holland","bui","film","notic","michel","pfeiffer","star","think","sai","someth","qualiti","unfortun","didntbr","br","plot","film","realli","confus","two","stori","line","run","simultan","dure","film","onli","thei","noth","common","throughout","entir","movi","wait","moment","thi","two","stori","line","come","togeth","plot","clear","still","hasntbr","br","titl","film","sai","film","natica","jackson","good","sometim","like","sai","film","cover","two","differ","stori","part","natica","jackson","short","anoth","titl","thi","movi","wrong","choicebr","br","conclud","stori","realli","recommend","leav","thi","movi","belong","shelf","store","place","nobodi","see","thi","wo","wast","minut","life"],"filtered2":["night","decid","watch","tale","hollywood","hill","natica","jackson","power","passion","murder","call","holland","bui","notic","michel","pfeiffer","star","think","someth","qualiti","unfortun","didntbr","plot","realli","confus","two","stori","line","run","simultan","dure","onli","noth","common","throughout","entir","wait","moment","two","stori","line","come","togeth","plot","clear","still","hasntbr","titl","natica","jackson","good","sometim","like","cover","two","differ","stori","part","natica","jackson","short","anoth","titl","wrong","choicebr","conclud","stori","realli","recommend","leav","belong","shelf","store","place","nobodi","see","wo","wast","minut","life"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,11,12,13,17,25,32,34,47,49,53,59,61,64,73,74,75,89,100,107,137,142,164,188,198,204,210,227,239,249,264,270,272,273,298,300,319,331,347,365,406,427,438,491,500,590,688,793,820,866,939,1018,1464,1540,1654,2291,2347,2477,4075,4919,6677],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,11,12,13,17,25,32,34,47,49,53,59,61,64,73,74,75,89,100,107,137,142,164,188,198,204,210,227,239,249,264,270,272,273,298,300,319,331,347,365,406,427,438,491,500,590,688,793,820,866,939,1018,1464,1540,1654,2291,2347,2477,4075,4919,6677],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,5.108214776042387,1.2796387880827016,2.742262257014735,1.3982850089458962,5.119408305932165,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,1.8950689206770979,1.9486336368009016,1.9742250248702675,1.9940046109572438,2.1405462403177813,4.287906797278791,2.2939035841256437,2.2844323215331563,2.3930275298746078,2.5378812223426954,2.5439726117360975,2.624524614047584,2.687151791517189,2.6005321873043625,2.6593400337329487,2.6754694156628323,5.51548139691143,2.731603554088023,2.8028805344481915,2.9674191958529437,2.7819920465008363,2.932274249550174,2.9056060024680126,2.932274249550174,3.0151989841543516,3.185521045582134,3.121829110937649,3.233054746047873,3.1797351085150902,3.369778711402955,3.3814747511661465,3.4986697244709752,3.6016814428070463,3.770603439954617,3.900174431363043,3.8962296530720266,3.969732115064953,4.268777946167049,4.589376833631972,4.528289141652134,15.269275494710637,5.259176650194926,5.064116067623542,5.156897801074508,5.822646007446338,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6168948300964624E-4,1.6154620178448803E-4,1.615860887

{"value":"Exactly what you would expect from a B-Movie. Deritive, gratuitous nudity, boring in parts, ridiculous gore and cheesy special-effects. Of course it could have been better, better acted (defintly) better written, directed, etc. But then I guess it wouldn't have been a B movie. The actors pretty much sucked, in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire slayer or something except with a lot of blood, profanity and nudity.<br /><br />Tiffany Shepis must be singled out. She absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium. Not that acting really matters in these movies, but she was better than any of the other actors. She's also smokin hot, in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie - wow! Her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit, I mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out. And near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely nekked.<br /><br />So if your a looser b-movie horror buff (like myself), check this out.

{"value":"This is not horror, as the first part was: This is (\"campy\") light and humorous entertainment. Like in so many sequels, the action starts right away with no explanations. But there's boobs, so I don't complain. And real boobs that is. If I understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in U.S. of A. Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela \"Bruce's sister\" Springsteen.<br /><br />This cannot be thought without the first movie, so I compare this to it. Again there is too small clothing (mainly pants) and funny hair, it's not hard to tell what decade this film is made in. Again there is really strange characters, this time even more visibly \"pathological\" ones. Especially the personnel of the camp. It's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp. People are older: Most of the actors must be at least 25, but I think they're supposed to be 16 or something. Some \"methods\" used by the Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant.

{"value":"I watched an episode. Yes I sat through the entire miserable experience, and I have to say, this brand of comedy is one of the worst you will get. Imagine Peter Griffin, of Family Guy fame. Now imagine Peter Griffin as a(admittedly slim and minus the glasses) woman, except that he now lacks the something that made him hilarious. Peter Griffin is an idiot, but he doesn't know he's an idiot. Sarah has none of the genuine character, none of the acting ability to pull her character off. Maybe its the trite, formulaic jokes that pull her comedy even lower than her character can take it by herself. Maybe it's the lack of believable foils. Her insensitive, bigoted persona may appeal to insensitive, bigoted people unlike the mass appeal that Stephen Colbert's insensitive, bigoted character has. Like Bill O'Reilly, Sarah creates an annoying, unfunny character. She lacks something that is necessary for the genre of satire, let alone for the entire world of comedy. What Sarah Silverman lacks, its noticeable.

{"value":"Beaudray Demerille(a weak Peter Fonda, who also directed), an aging gambler, wins young teen Wanda \"Nevada\"(pretty, but not talented Brooke Shields) in a poker game. Together the unlikely pair(of course)embark on a search for Indian gold in the Grand Canyon.<br /><br />That's the story and there really is no need to search for a deeper meaning in it. It just isn't there. The acting is very weak too, which was quite a surprise given the fact that Peter Fonda was in the lead.<br /><br />If you're looking for something interesting in this film, take a look at the nice scenery and some good looks of a young Brooke Shields. Her character however is so irritating(especially at the beginning)and dumb, that she never quite comes off as sexy or appealing. Too bad, but, given the story, I doubt anything more could be made of this. I wonder why Peter Fonda directed and starred in this film. He must have even talked his father(Henry Fonda)into a (useless) cameo in this ridiculous mess. Unfortunately, this was their only film together.
