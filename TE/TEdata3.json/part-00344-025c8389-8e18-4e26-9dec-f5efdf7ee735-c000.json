{"value":"The movie's premise is spooky: a woman gets pregnant when kissed by a stranger in a bar.<br /><br />But as soon as the movie begins, a horrible opening scene establishes that this is a C type Sci-Fi TV movie. It's a big Star Trek and a bit X-files, but more than anything else it's boring.<br /><br />When the movie kicks into action everything is predictable and cliche. It looked more like a 2 parter in a bad Sci-Fi TV series. No suspense and no thrills, but not for a lack of trying. Just a lot of predictable dramatic conflicts between the main characters.<br /><br />Don't waste your time.","finished_norm":["the","movi","premis","be","spooki","a","woman","get","pregnant","when","kiss","by","a","strang","in","a","barbr","br","but","a","soon","a","the","movi","begin","a","horribl","open","scene","establish","that","thi","be","a","c","typ","scifi","tv","movi","it","a","big","star","trek","and","a","bite","xfile","but","much","than","anyth","els","it","boringbr","br","when","the","movi","kick","into","action","everyth","be","predict","and","clich","it","look","much","like","a","parter","in","a","bad","scifi","tv","seri","no","suspens","and","no","thrill","but","not","for","a","lack","of","try","just","a","lot","of","predict","dramat","conflict","between","the","main","charactersbr","br","do","not","wast","your","time"],"filtered":["movi","premis","spooki","woman","get","pregnant","kiss","strang","barbr","br","soon","movi","begin","horribl","open","scene","establish","thi","c","typ","scifi","tv","movi","big","star","trek","bite","xfile","much","anyth","els","boringbr","br","movi","kick","action","everyth","predict","clich","look","much","like","parter","bad","scifi","tv","seri","suspens","thrill","lack","try","lot","predict","dramat","conflict","main","charactersbr","br","wast","time"],"filtered2":["premis","spooki","woman","get","pregnant","kiss","strang","barbr","soon","begin","horribl","open","scene","establish","c","typ","scifi","tv","big","star","trek","bite","xfile","anyth","els","boringbr","kick","action","everyth","predict","clich","look","like","parter","bad","scifi","tv","suspens","thrill","lack","try","lot","predict","dramat","conflict","main","charactersbr","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,8,9,16,19,36,70,72,82,89,100,104,129,147,154,172,179,183,193,196,230,242,337,384,417,449,484,529,756,781,869,1115,1218,1331,1461,1523,1581,1814,2304,3029,3101,3122,5652],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,8,9,16,19,36,70,72,82,89,100,104,129,147,154,172,179,183,193,196,230,242,337,384,417,449,484,529,756,781,869,1115,1218,1331,1461,1523,1581,1814,2304,3029,3101,3122,5652],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.4680183469605717,2.094675786251684,1.9209463754160525,2.020196584395323,1.9940046109572438,2.1405462403177813,2.0728240170322856,2.4106958340079214,2.2844323215331563,2.348499626138016,5.000281788719697,2.507968722980095,2.4885128563647294,2.517840471459249,2.478925055209576,2.7121382192999195,2.689504733779216,5.947318931426056,3.109204957709252,3.1932880749197934,3.2597778161886266,3.291526514503207,3.4648563601051974,3.7636829971100436,7.872791389594723,3.9161110236258554,4.2078172463773615,4.297765483040301,4.513582994262438,4.6295428753573065,4.605250182788262,4.671389985292807,4.869215728622727,5.339219357868463,5.408212229355414,5.426230734858092,5.463272006538442,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040351983E-4,2.558082347393931E-4,2.558713957686224E-4,2.5581995743348244E-4,2.558441677579872E-4,2.5580682428995955E-4,2.5588638376375974E-4,2.557687644066796E-4,2.5580828880184843E-4,2.5607263894884255E-4,2.581045008218022E-4,2.5580871133099134E-4,2.560509783460781E-4,2.5607765444043924E-4,2.559613250483811E-4,2.558209650712687E-4,2.5590897737707473E-4,2.560294090118495E-4,2.5583417200467453E-4,2.5583323664955863E-4,2.5606339753655283E-4,2.558588685280096E-4,2.558592557482336E-4,2.56023161926908E-4,2.5583426429050233E-4,2.5608071520047084E-4,2.558982858246216E-4,2.5580766142006E-4,2.559236336818261E-4,2.5600174526388257E-4,2.5586012355716955E-4,2.559971566675945E-4,2.561228448805953E-4,2.5636056659471284E-4,2.558978436251894E-4,2.5582080991179803E-4,2.5591304776099083E-4,2.5584679090401096E-4,2.5576903739242454E-4,2.5583409277699467E-4,2.5609048225741553E-4,2.5595000050774463E-4,2.559977400410072E-4,2.5578176698886625E-4,2.558341578291235E-4,2.55820713713406E-4,2.559073067055552E-4,2.5595168135239554E-4,2.5589963502432053E-4,2.5585907448005867E-4,2.5582134633837355E-4,2.5634548273227814E-4,2.558857183582286E-4,2.5583409919225936E-4,2.558843479954321E-4,2.5580792314607254E-4,0.9797817241788903,2.558478334539958E-4,2.558217054788009E-4,2.558077771243864E-4,2.560124294824374E-4,2.559096596755835E-4,2.5580767019001886E-4,2.5578166277759047E-4,2.5575594110598864E-4,2.559871849625101E-4,2.5582020202291356E-4,2.559364883717663E-4,2.5601159924283526E-4,2.558954517621165E-4,2.5583443803604876E-4,2.5578199809030594E-4,2.5584743185131737E-4,2.557818603229539E-4,2.557952833413215E-4,2.5578200532957405E-4,2.559480435940783E-4,2.5587186526541906E-4,2.558080116274144E-4,2.558327914289874E-4]}}

No wonder Left Wing critic Roger Ebert loved this movie; it's right up his political alley, too.<br /><br />Unlike the reviewers here, I am glad Judd elevated herself from this moronic fluff to better roles in movies that entertained, not preached the heavy-handed Liberal agenda.","finished_norm":["ashlei","judd","in","a","earli","role","and","i","think","her","star","role","show","her","reallif","rebelli","natur","in","thi","slowmov","feminist","soap","opu","wow","be","thi","a","vehicl","for","polit","correct","and","extrem","liber","or","whatbr","br","be","a","staunch","feminist","in","real","life","she","must","have","cherish","thi","script","no","wonder","leav","wing","critic","roger","ebert","love","thi","movi","it","right","up","hi","polit","allei","toobr","br","unlik","the","review","here","i","be","glad","judd","elev","herself","from","thi","moron","fluff","to","well","role","in","movi","that","entertain","not","preach","the","heavyhand","liber","agendum"],"filtered":["ashlei","judd","earli","role","think","star","role","show","reallif","rebelli","natur","thi","slowmov","feminist","soap","opu","wow","thi","vehicl","polit","correct","extrem","liber","whatbr","br","staunch","feminist","real","life","must","cherish","thi","script","wonder","leav","wing","critic","roger","ebert","love","thi","movi","right","hi","polit","allei","toobr","br","unlik","review","glad","judd","elev","thi","moron","fluff","well","role","movi","entertain","preach","heavyhand","liber","agendum"],"filtered2":["ashlei","judd","earli","role","think","star","role","show","reallif","rebelli","natur","slowmov","feminist","soap","opu","wow","vehicl","polit","correct","extrem","liber","whatbr","staunch","feminist","real","life","must","cherish","script","wonder","leav","wing","critic","roger","ebert","love","right","polit","allei","toobr","unlik","review","glad","judd","elev","moron","fluff","well","role","entertain","preach","heavyhand","liber","agendum"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,20,28,54,74,75,77,80,100,121,128,141,175,176,195,266,329,456,575,579,615,1003,1200,1227,1343,1387,1423,1466,1479,1887,2219,2617,2716,3216,3236,3268,3608,3683,3727,3823,3944,5111,5413,6095,6748,6828,8337],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,20,28,54,74,75,77,80,100,121,128,141,175,176,195,266,329,456,575,579,615,1003,1200,1227,1343,1387,1423,1466,1479,1887,2219,2617,2716,3216,3236,3268,3608,3683,3727,3823,3944,5111,5413,6095,6748,6828,8337],"values":[1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,1.5452294193519092,1.8113893252729412,1.9486336368009016,1.9742250248702675,1.9463902258768238,1.9951803900462557,2.1405462403177813,2.2190595059394194,7.0229706123476525,2.2657547357741192,2.3791142619576227,2.5040471493269134,2.51289241584188,2.747702973022204,2.951986790814132,3.3001658770939146,7.262891089427001,3.5642670069567886,3.5013187326425523,4.035401218572811,4.499089986959872,4.246178114249808,4.520909034354511,4.422928625994308,4.470719289830655,4.484804029712395,4.715065048795469,9.801928853874614,5.185068678041204,5.290429193699031,5.274680836730892,5.583416318380505,5.672363804397,5.649374286172302,5.878215858601149,11.756431717202299,5.770002273960917,6.032366538428407,5.850044981634453,6.437831646536572,6.2980697041614135,6.437831646536572,13.737229125258052,6.600350576034347,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125571E-4,2.273779263270827E-4,2.2743406769354602E-4,2.2738834617097757E-4,2.2740986578072433E-4,2.2737667263379285E-4,2.2744738993572328E-4,2.2734284269338738E-4,2.27377974381083E-4,2.276129448788428E-4,2.2941898734736622E-4,2.2737834995069833E-4,2.2759369161694297E-4,2.276174029529933E-4,2.275140023100702E-4,2.273892418207621E-4,2.2746747251417907E-4,2.2757451948007197E-4,2.2740098094688527E-4,2.2740014954633695E-4,0.41409900395220944,2.2742293271974017E-4,2.2742327690463971E-4,2.2756896669080763E-4,2.274010629761451E-4,2.276201235427729E-4,2.2745796921172092E-4,2.2737741672596988E-4,2.2748049992975616E-4,2.2754993025739283E-4,2.2742404826603274E-4,2.2754585163377154E-4,2.2765757096628245E-4,2.2786887249241994E-4,2.2745757615795538E-4,2.2738910390558226E-4,2.2747109051910822E-4,2.2741219739254258E-4,2.2734308533973015E-4,2.27400910524502E-4,2.2762880509736262E-4,2.27503936369194E-4,2.2754637017156215E-4,2.2735440017971115E-4,2.2740096834679289E-4,2.2738901839859728E-4,2.2746598751966326E-4,2.275054304062081E-4,2.2745916846251936E-4,2.274231157824547E-4,2.2738958071416703E-4,2.2785546503755478E-4,2.2744679848279374E-4,2.2740091622677964E-4,2.2744558042094633E-4,2.2737764936397726E-4,0.5681573668390069,2.2741312407441381E-4,2.2738989994003443E-4,2.2737751957101646E-4,2.275594270410359E-4,2.2746807898261516E-4,2.2737742452124304E-4,2.2735430755038743E-4,2.2733144456336726E-4,2.275369881754613E-4,2.273885635769485E-4,2.274919259604512E-4,2.2755868907355298E-4,2.2745545012449865E-4,2.2740121741176013E-4,2.273546055967345E-4,2.274127671055136E-4,2.273544831407281E-4,2.2736641433631524E-4,2.2735461203143652E-4,2.275021969452388E-4,2.274344850108703E-4,2.2737772

The ending is even very similar to the way \"The Omen\" ends. <br /><br />Not to mention that the acting, writing, and story are all just hackneyed.

{"value":"I am oh soooo glad I have not spent money to go to the cinema on it :-). It is nothing more than compilation of elements of few other classic titles like The Thing, Final Fantasy, The Abyss etc. framed in rather dull and meaningless scenario. I really can not figure out what was the purpose of creating this movie - it has absolutely nothing new to offer in its storyline which additionally is also senseless. Moreover there is nothing to watch - the FX'es look like there were taken from a second hand store, you generally saw all of them in other movies. But it is definitely a good lullaby.","finished_norm":["i","be","oh","soooo","glad","i","have","not","spend","monei","to","go","to","the","cinema","on","it","it","be","noth","much","than","compil","of","elem","of","few","other","classic","titl","like","the","thing","final","fantasi","the","abyss","etc","frame","in","rather","dull","and","meaningless","scenario","i","realli","can","not","figur","out","what","be","the","purpos","of","creat","thi","movi","it","have","absolut","noth","new","to","offer","in","it","storylin","which","addition","be","conjur","senseless","moreov","there","be","noth","to","watch","the","fx","e","look","like","there","be","take","from","a","hand","store","you","gener","see","all","of","them","in","other","movi","but","it","be","definit","a","good","lullabi"],"filtered":["oh","soooo","glad","spend","monei","go","cinema","noth","much","compil","elem","classic","titl","like","thing","final","fantasi","abyss","etc","frame","rather","dull","meaningless","scenario","realli","figur","purpos","creat","thi","movi","absolut","noth","new","offer","storylin","addition","conjur","senseless","moreov","noth","watch","fx","e","look","like","take","hand","store","gener","see","movi","definit","good","lullabi"],"filtered2":["oh","soooo","glad","spend","monei","go","cinema","noth","compil","elem","classic","titl","like","thing","final","fantasi","abyss","etc","frame","rather","dull","meaningless","scenario","realli","figur","purpos","creat","absolut","noth","new","offer","storylin","addition","conjur","senseless","moreov","noth","watch","fx","e","look","like","take","hand","store","gener","see","definit","good","lullabi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,7,13,16,29,31,39,49,87,126,156,160,222,225,234,235,264,283,332,362,367,392,409,415,429,479,507,515,793,794,996,1227,1401,1569,2148,2249,2397,3498,4437,5140,5405,5902],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,7,13,16,29,31,39,49,87,126,156,160,222,225,234,235,264,283,332,362,367,392,409,415,429,479,507,515,793,794,996,1227,1401,1569,2148,2249,2397,3498,4437,5140,5405,5902],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.5538940054862738,5.076090992426206,2.115024371522662,2.2391270689902285,2.3451551414151686,2.3722295531801256,2.5771019354959765,2.641219492619754,2.673149229007135,2.6457189377809835,2.757740698455715,2.7678802023081546,2.9705344631698933,3.058539100262467,3.0791938792932125,3.0670934723591254,3.2209578243390444,3.1588018988486244,3.2872346624216657,3.360519385990158,3.365138331846453,3.3956930001684253,3.770603439954617,3.7465885637507435,4.1302590120314875,4.246178114249808,4.470719289830655,4.597282013139085,5.170884043049248,5.0768550934009715,5.129498826886393,5.672363804397,5.967828017290836,6.255510089742618,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278315E-4,2.5058620691581344E-4,2.5064807858603386E-4,2.5059769030472655E-4,2.506214064035927E-4,2.5058482525906593E-4,2.5066276061866887E-4,2.5054754232407166E-4,2.505862598746466E-4,2.5084521362060545E-4,2.528355973796038E-4,2.5058667377834807E-4,2.508239951938735E-4,2.5085012672676997E-4,2.50736172064058E-4,2.5059867737275846E-4,2.5068489300962527E-4,2.5080286617253626E-4,2.5061161470196726E-4,2.5061069844103907E-4,2.508361608610077E-4,2.5063580707447954E-4,2.506361863900528E-4,2.507967466145738E-4,2.506117051038871E-4,2.5085312500494264E-4,2.5067441971279023E-4,2.505856453001282E-4,2.506992501229481E-4,2.507757671478345E-4,2.506370364836778E-4,2.50771272222407E-4,2.508943946566085E-4,2.5112726355820165E-4,2.5067398654034554E-4,2.50598525380688E-4,2.5068888030138414E-4,2.5062397600113885E-4,2.505478097371299E-4,2.506115370916284E-4,2.508626926787706E-4,2.5072507870075775E-4,2.507718436869295E-4,2.50560279473654E-4,2.5061160081579363E-4,2.505984311460744E-4,2.5068325644292324E-4,2.5072672523291853E-4,2.5067574137014535E-4,2.5063600882225693E-4,2.505990508567384E-4,2.511124876152888E-4,2.5066210879661833E-4,2.5061154337593293E-4,2.5066076640818576E-4,2.505859016833084E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.506249972686773E-4,2.505994026657313E-4,2.505857586424853E-4,2.507862332604843E-4,2.5068556137980294E-4,2.505856538910586E-4,2.5056017738973033E-4,2.5053498079616164E-4,2.507615040780933E-4,2.505979299011487E-4,2.507118423993323E-4,2.5078541996925876E-4,2.506716435043776E-4,2.506118753026202E-4,2.505605058574264E-4,2.506246038642509E-4,2.505603709024347E-4,2.505735199054819E-4,2.505605129489132E-4,2.507231617352097E-4,2.506485384985991E-4,2.505859883584065E-4,2.506102623091283E-4]}}
{"value":"One of the worst films I have ever seen. Got so bored that I switched it off midway through to watch the news. When I switched it back on, I fell asleep. The film starts with a dream, continues with a dream, and ends with a dream. Then there are a few more dreams in between. Come on, what is supposed to keep me interested in that? A film needs to have a reason to be interesting. The minute you felt the film was only a dream is when any sensible film-goer switches off. Ever had someone insist on telling you their dreams and what it means to them? This is it!!!<br /><br />Absolutely awful.","finished_norm":["on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","get","so","bore","that","i","switch","it","off","midwai","through","to","watch","the","new","when","i","switch","it","back","on","i","fall","asleep","the","film","start","with","a","dream","continu","with","a","dream","and","end","with","a","dream","then","there","be","a","few","much","dream","in","between","come","on","what","be","suppos","to","keep","me","interest","in","that","a","film","ne","to","have","a","reason","to","be","interest","the","minut","you","feel","the","film","be","onli","a","dream","be","when","ani","sensibl","filmgoer","switch","off","ever","have","someon","insist","on","tell","you","their","dream","and","what","it","mean","to","them","thi","be","itbr","br","absolut","aw"],"filtered":["wrong","film","ever","see","get","bore","switch","midwai","watch","new","switch","back","fall","asleep","film","start","dream","continu","dream","end","dream","much","dream","come","suppos","keep","interest","film","ne","reason","interest","minut","feel","film","onli","dream","ani","sensibl","filmgoer","switch","ever","someon","insist","tell","dream","mean","thi","itbr","br","absolut","aw"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","see","get","bore","switch","midwai","watch","new","switch","back","fall","asleep","start","dream","continu","dream","end","dream","dream","come","suppos","keep","interest","ne","reason","interest","minut","feel","onli","dream","ani","sensibl","filmgoer","switch","ever","someon","insist","tell","dream","mean","itbr","absolut","aw"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,11,24,25,27,34,43,44,59,60,63,71,87,88,90,95,108,110,134,138,139,149,169,222,430,433,607,1346,1579,1912,2754,7431,7906],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,11,24,25,27,34,43,44,59,60,63,71,87,88,90,95,108,110,134,138,139,149,169,222,430,433,607,1346,1579,1912,2754,7431,7906],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3982850089458962,1.6608112036218214,3.209458785004948,1.8693254449200722,3.676353282473182,1.8729627573220065,1.9214926742550966,2.115024371522662,2.0317223413467334,2.0477128419653545,2.0323326556775485,2.138507503627933,2.1290479736304078,2.2443961816702407,2.2907365189289424,2.2939035841256437,2.3253197803590226,2.4071371113909277,2.5771019354959765,3.1419947805322432,3.164467636384302,22.08594768758958,4.416284083275639,13.815750548364786,4.838444069955973,5.322690055917252,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.731092965484182E-4,2.728672805936191E-4,2.7293465363304776E-4,2.728797850372725E-4,2.72905609872101E-4,2.728657760857531E-4,2.7295064113039654E-4,2.7282517810867503E-4,2.728673382613293E-4,2.731493170874148E-4,2.7531667741558343E-4,2.728677889676106E-4,2.731262120072426E-4,2.731546670463566E-4,2.7303058001336346E-4,2.7288085987125057E-4,2.7297474144065555E-4,2.7310320428201764E-4,2.728949475334679E-4,2.7289394980246396E-4,2.7313945939443275E-4,2.72921290990196E-4,2.7292170403291776E-4,2.7309654059864806E-4,2.72895045973547E-4,2.7315793191883903E-4,2.7296333690222783E-4,2.7286666904142445E-4,2.729903751282307E-4,2.7307369572578816E-4,2.7292262971329967E-4,2.730688011304592E-4,2.7320287109470077E-4,2.734564457215512E-4,2.729628652139076E-4,2.7288069436468324E-4,2.729790832656609E-4,2.72908407947475E-4,2.7282546929897997E-4,2.728948630223435E-4,2.731683503100632E-4,2.730185002747632E-4,2.730694234072083E-4,2.728390477921338E-4,2.72894932412594E-4,2.728805917511233E-4,2.7297295935731187E-4,2.7302029320965237E-4,2.7296477607580724E-4,2.729215106765389E-4,2.728812665638583E-4,2.7344035596381686E-4,2.7294993135106526E-4,2.7289486986542197E-4,2.72948469603088E-4,2.728669482211209E-4,0.9784334310143922,2.729095200218362E-4,2.7288164965423014E-4,2.728667924617082E-4,2.7308509244124303E-4,2.729754692395039E-4,2.728666783962243E-4,2.728389366313361E-4,2.728114996624306E-4,2.7305816444375507E-4,2.728800459376028E-4,2.730040870569746E-4,2.7308420683557546E-4,2.729603138450163E-4,2.7289523130563697E-4,2.72839294305001E-4,2.729090916375395E-4,2.7283914735037787E-4,2.728534655075829E-4,2.7283930202703303E-4,2.730164128606851E-4,2.729351544391078E-4,2.728670426030049E-4,2.728934748915344E-4]}}
{"value":"I'll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments. There are enough canned plot elements in this movie that it's essentially pre-spoiled.<br /><br />This movie derives a few ideas from a Southern classic, To Kill A Mockingbird. I suppose maybe TKOM got its ideas from some source.... at any rate, after you watch this, you'll say, \"Oh yeah, that is a ripoff\".<br /><br />I think the truly entertaining thing about these McMovies is once you've identified a plot element, is to figure out whether they'll stick with the original, or try to twist it around.

{"value":"Timberlake's performance almost made attack the screen.

I don't think the cracked a smile in the whole movie, not even when proposed to his girlfriend.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman pretty much carried the whole movie.

Give you a clue to the silliness, she destroys a $10,000 wedding dress, because \"It just won't be me\" makes it into this rag, with straps and puts on a top hat, and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy, rather than ringwalding her neck.

{"value":"If you've ever seen this movie, you'd know that it! If you haven't, and want to see a classic BAD movie, I suggest you see this movie, because it ranks right down with the worst. So, if you're REALLY bored, go rent it. If you want to know what it's like, here's my little summary: Adam Sandler is hired to work on a giant cruise ship with some Ms Universe models and five other people. Adam doesn't like how one passenger is getting all the babes, and he tries to take over with the cheezy jokes. BUT WAIT! It only gets worse! You'll have to rent the movie yourself to see how bad it truly is.","finished_norm":["if","you","have","ever","see","thi","movi","you","have","know","that","it","if","you","have","not","and","want","to","see","a","classic","bad","movi","i","suggest","you","see","thi","movi","becaus","it","rank","right","down","with","the","wrong","so","if","you","re","realli","bore","go","rend","it","if","you","want","to","know","what","it","like","here","my","littl","summari","adam","sandler","be","hire","to","work","on","a","giant","cruis","ship","with","some","m","univers","model","and","five","other","peopl","adam","doe","not","like","how","on","passeng","be","get","all","the","babe","and","he","try","to","take","over","with","the","cheezi","joke","but","wait","it","onli","get","wrong","you","will","have","to","rend","the","movi","yourself","to","see","how","bad","it","truli","be"],"filtered":["ever","see","thi","movi","know","want","see","classic","bad","movi","suggest","see","thi","movi","becaus","rank","right","wrong","re","realli","bore","go","rend","want","know","like","littl","summari","adam","sandler","hire","work","giant","cruis","ship","m","univers","model","five","peopl","adam","doe","like","passeng","get","babe","try","take","cheezi","joke","wait","onli","get","wrong","rend","movi","see","bad","truli"],"filtered2":["ever","see","know","want","see","classic","bad","suggest","see","becaus","rank","right","wrong","re","realli","bore","go","rend","want","know","like","littl","summari","adam","sandler","hire","work","giant","cruis","ship","m","univers","model","five","peopl","adam","doe","like","passeng","get","babe","try","take","cheezi","joke","wait","onli","get","wrong","rend","see","bad","truli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,9,11,13,14,18,22,23,25,26,31,36,37,44,48,68,108,121,214,331,332,342,504,533,646,907,913,987,1014,1105,1221,1248,1655,1838,2456,2608,2708,3547,8229],"values":[2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,9,11,13,14,18,22,23,25,26,31,36,37,44,48,68,108,121,214,331,332,342,504,533,646,907,913,987,1014,1105,1221,1248,1655,1838,2456,2608,2708,3547,8229],"values":[1.2920765891153156,2.6228008218775787,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,2.559277576165403,2.6649848339420377,1.4070669811451506,1.4680183469605717,2.975308642954861,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,2.0064197866819473,2.138507503627933,2.2190595059394194,2.7303758068497004,2.932274249550174,2.9705344631698933,2.9705344631698933,3.3956930001684253,6.849501469295936,3.5900195030592035,4.181290492043933,4.067587905068712,4.383707912841026,4.1302590120314875,4.390138803171316,4.470719289830655,9.275546748987644,4.637773374493822,4.760735085628657,5.214056214914456,5.390512652256013,5.878215858601149,5.907203395474402,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255713E-4,2.2737792632708274E-4,2.2743406769354605E-4,2.273883461709776E-4,2.2740986578072435E-4,2.2737667263379287E-4,2.274473899357233E-4,2.273428426933874E-4,2.2737797438108302E-4,2.2761294487884284E-4,2.2941898734737696E-4,2.2737834995069836E-4,2.27593691616943E-4,2.2761740295299332E-4,2.2751400231007022E-4,2.2738924182076213E-4,2.2746747251417912E-4,2.2757451948007202E-4,2.274009809468853E-4,2.2740014954633698E-4,2.276047305492107E-4,2.274229327197402E-4,2.2742327690463974E-4,2.2756896669080766E-4,2.2740106297614512E-4,2.2762012354277293E-4,2.2745796921172095E-4,2.273774167259699E-4,2.2748049992975619E-4,2.2754993025739289E-4,2.2742404826603277E-4,2.2754585163377156E-4,2.276575709662825E-4,2.2786887249241997E-4,2.2745757615795544E-4,2.2738910390558229E-4,2.2747109051910825E-4,2.274121973925426E-4,2.2734308533973018E-4,2.2740091052450204E-4,2.2762880509736268E-4,2.2750393636919404E-4,2.2754637017156218E-4,2.2735440017971118E-4,2.274009683467929E-4,2.273890183985973E-4,2.2746598751966328E-4,2.2750543040620812E-4,2.2745916846251938E-4,2.2742311578245473E-4,2.2738958071416706E-4,2.278554650375548E-4,2.2744679848279376E-4,2.2740091622677967E-4,2.2744558042094636E-4,2.273776493639773E-4,0.9820287660606671,2.2741312407441384E-4,2.2738989994003445E-4,2.273775195710165E-4,2.2755942704103592E-4,2.274680789826152E-4,2.2737742452124307E-4,2.2735430755038745E-4,2.273314445633673E-4,2.2753698817546132E-4,2.2738856357694854E-4,2.2749192596045124E-4,2.27558689073553E-4,2.2745545012449868E-4,2.2740121741176016E-4,2.2735460559673455E-4,2.2741276710551363E-4,2.2735448314072811E-4,2.2736641433631526E-4,2.2735461203143655E-4,2.2750219694523882E-4,2.2743448501087032E-4,2.273777280115785E-4,2.273997538071992E-4]}}
{"value":"I went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the Son of Sam had on the society. I didn't expect Spike Lee to force-feed me more garbage on racial tension, mob-justice, or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers. Lee has presented an extreme opinion.<br /><br />The entire movie could have been more effective if in a 90-min format with more focus, less tangential sub-plots.<br /><br />Don't even bother renting the video unless you passionately enjoy Spike Lee; in such a case, the theatre is worth it.

{"value":"The House of the Dead was the worst movie I have ever seen, between the pathetic 'matrix' 360 camera angle attemps and the cheesy acting I fell asleep. I don't think that the director and set manager could decide whether it was raining or not, because there would be rain on one side of the boat and not the other. I would rate this movie a 1 out of 10, (10 being the best, 1 being the worst). Also jumping scenes from the movie to the game was really annoying, it makes you wonder if they were just making up for lose time. I beg anyone who reads this, NOT TO SEE IT. It's not worth the time.","finished_norm":["the","hous","of","the","dead","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","between","the","pathet","matrix","camera","angl","attemp","and","the","cheesi","act","i","fall","asleep","i","do","not","think","that","the","director","and","set","manag","can","decid","whether","it","be","rain","or","not","becaus","there","would","be","rain","on","on","side","of","the","boat","and","not","the","other","i","would","rate","thi","movi","a","out","of","be","the","well","be","the","wrong","conjur","jump","scene","from","the","movi","to","the","game","be","realli","annoi","it","make","you","wonder","if","thei","be","just","make","up","for","lose","time","i","beg","anyon","who","read","thi","not","to","see","it","it","not","worth","the","time"],"filtered":["hous","dead","wrong","movi","ever","see","pathet","matrix","camera","angl","attemp","cheesi","act","fall","asleep","think","director","set","manag","decid","whether","rain","becaus","rain","side","boat","rate","thi","movi","well","wrong","conjur","jump","scene","movi","game","realli","annoi","make","wonder","thei","make","lose","time","beg","anyon","read","thi","see","worth","time"],"filtered2":["hous","dead","wrong","ever","see","pathet","matrix","camera","angl","attemp","cheesi","act","fall","asleep","think","director","set","manag","decid","whether","rain","becaus","rain","side","boat","rate","well","wrong","conjur","jump","scene","game","realli","annoi","make","wonder","make","lose","time","beg","anyon","read","see","worth","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,8,12,13,19,20,21,22,25,39,44,58,109,145,158,169,175,202,213,219,221,228,231,249,271,345,374,425,543,597,602,674,1293,1346,1449,1858,1966,2061],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,8,12,13,19,20,21,22,25,39,44,58,109,145,158,169,175,202,213,219,221,228,231,249,271,345,374,425,543,597,602,674,1293,1346,1449,1858,1966,2061],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.3114004109387893,1.8837873718108231,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.559277576165403,1.5538940054862738,1.604729392502474,1.865701314626681,2.125691139326857,2.34599021453259,2.3106972614914807,2.4071371113909277,2.3791142619576227,2.597304642813496,2.8432628718938773,2.5792094178355414,2.6423424573643777,2.7742700004069256,2.7049353070058615,2.6754694156628323,2.757740698455715,3.0022328381570844,3.4572130107926293,3.226987993365636,3.477726550625732,3.4986697244709752,3.506637894120152,3.6405503117064195,4.409683399244287,4.416284083275639,4.679973728984199,5.170884043049248,4.85885294158718,10.153710186801943]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.73109296548418E-4,2.7286728059361886E-4,2.7293465363304755E-4,2.728797850372723E-4,2.729056098721008E-4,2.7286577608575286E-4,2.729506411303963E-4,2.728251781086748E-4,2.728673382613291E-4,2.731493170874146E-4,2.753166774160107E-4,2.7286778896761036E-4,2.731262120072424E-4,2.7315466704635636E-4,2.7303058001336325E-4,2.7288085987125035E-4,2.7297474144065534E-4,2.731032042820174E-4,2.728949475334677E-4,2.7289394980246375E-4,2.7313945939443253E-4,2.729212909901958E-4,2.7292170403291755E-4,2.7309654059864784E-4,2.728950459735468E-4,2.731579319188388E-4,2.729633369022276E-4,2.7286666904142423E-4,2.729903751282305E-4,2.7307369572578794E-4,2.7292262971329945E-4,2.7306880113045896E-4,2.7320287109470055E-4,2.7345644572155097E-4,2.729628652139074E-4,2.72880694364683E-4,2.7297908326566066E-4,2.729084079474748E-4,2.7282546929897975E-4,2.728948630223433E-4,2.73168350310063E-4,2.73018500274763E-4,2.730694234072081E-4,2.7283904779213357E-4,2.728949324125938E-4,2.7288059175112307E-4,2.7297295935731165E-4,2.7302029320965215E-4,2.729647760758071E-4,2.729215106765387E-4,2.728812665638581E-4,2.7344035596381665E-4,2.7294993135106504E-4,2.7289486986542175E-4,2.7294846960308777E-4,2.728669482211207E-4,0.9784334310143917,2.72909520021836E-4,2.728816496542299E-4,2.72866792461708E-4,2.730850924412428E-4,2.729754692395037E-4,2.728666783962241E-4,2.728389366313359E-4,2.728114996624304E-4,2.730581644437549E-4,2.728800459376026E-4,2.730040870569744E-4,2.730842068355753E-4,2.729603138450161E-4,2.7289523130563675E-4,2.7283929430500076E-4,2.729090916375393E-4,2.7283914735037765E-4,2.7285346550758266E-4,2.728393020270328E-4,2.730164128606849E-4,2.729351544391076E-4,2.7286704260300466E-4,2.728934748915342E-4]}}
{"value":"When the film started the first 4 minutes seemed like a travelogue of California, I was wondering if I got the tapes mixed up. Then I breathed a sigh of relief to see Paul Thomas in a scene with the lovely Joanna Storm and Laurie Smith. This is being spied on by Jimmy (a young Tom Byron). Jimmy's aunt (Honey Wilder) is concerned about his behavior so she hires him a private teacher (Kay Parker). I could do without the animal, robot role-playing, or the incest aspects.There's one good sex scene, between Byron and Parker, but it's not good enough to save this film.<br /><br />My Grade:

{"value":"Why do all movies on Lifetime have such anemic titles? \"An Unexpected Love\" - ooh, how provocative!! \"This Much I know\" would have been better. The film is nothing special. Real people don't really talk like these characters do and the situations are really hackneyed. The straight woman who \"turns\" lesbian seemed more butch than the lesbian character. If you wanna watch two hot women kiss in a very discreet fashion, you might enjoy this. Although it seems like it was written by someone who doesn't really get out in the world to observe people. Why am I wasting my time writing about it?","finished_norm":["why","do","all","movi","on","lifetim","have","such","anem","titl","a","unexpect","love","ooh","how","provoc","thi","much","i","know","would","have","be","well","the","film","be","noth","special","real","peopl","do","not","realli","talk","like","thi","charact","do","and","the","situat","be","realli","hacknei","the","straight","woman","who","turn","lesbian","seem","much","butch","than","the","lesbian","charact","if","you","wanna","watch","two","hot","woman","kiss","in","a","veri","discreet","fashion","you","mai","enjoi","thi","although","it","seem","like","it","be","write","by","someon","who","doe","not","realli","get","out","in","the","world","to","observ","peopl","why","be","i","wast","my","time","write","about","it"],"filtered":["movi","lifetim","anem","titl","unexpect","love","ooh","provoc","thi","much","know","well","film","noth","special","real","peopl","realli","talk","like","thi","charact","situat","realli","hacknei","straight","woman","turn","lesbian","seem","much","butch","lesbian","charact","wanna","watch","two","hot","woman","kiss","veri","discreet","fashion","mai","enjoi","thi","although","seem","like","write","someon","doe","realli","get","world","observ","peopl","wast","time","write"],"filtered2":["lifetim","anem","titl","unexpect","love","ooh","provoc","know","well","noth","special","real","peopl","realli","talk","like","charact","situat","realli","hacknei","straight","woman","turn","lesbian","seem","butch","lesbian","charact","wanna","watch","two","hot","woman","kiss","veri","discreet","fashion","mai","enjoi","although","seem","like","write","someon","doe","realli","get","world","observ","peopl","wast","time","write"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,8,10,13,15,18,20,23,26,35,46,47,49,54,65,70,80,89,96,139,165,186,200,203,237,264,473,548,666,1037,1239,1461,1852,2017,2041,2812,2844,4505,5030,7153],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,8,10,13,15,18,20,23,26,35,46,47,49,54,65,70,80,89,96,139,165,186,200,203,237,264,473,548,666,1037,1239,1461,1852,2017,2041,2812,2844,4505,5030,7153],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,3.3953824709201923,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,2.729695454751562,1.3324924169710188,2.926338025798268,1.655771293751733,1.7064694353107215,1.6920303308087352,1.8113893252729412,3.8147700134888347,4.189351572503368,1.9951803900462557,1.9940046109572438,2.0390708128715254,2.2939035841256437,2.448847599972298,2.571852579609833,2.5308211829319704,2.569760528637609,2.640097787510554,2.757740698455715,3.335489637924323,3.459754308221302,3.6621227969605474,4.062925891962901,9.147503031457783,4.6295428753573065,4.838444069955973,5.00274712124725,4.9676558014359795,5.339219357868463,5.339219357868463,6.214688095222362,6.137727054086234,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.363349508791836E-4,2.3612552253122075E-4,2.3618382374676044E-4,2.3613634324334574E-4,2.3615869074724907E-4,2.361242206063244E-4,2.3619765851711923E-4,2.3608908917345194E-4,2.3612557243393606E-4,2.363695826263905E-4,2.3824510646673115E-4,2.3612596245232132E-4,2.3634958866039754E-4,2.363742122098565E-4,2.36266833577134E-4,2.3613727335022462E-4,2.36218513704816E-4,2.3632967894044436E-4,2.3614946409949685E-4,2.3614860071362613E-4,2.3636105227822538E-4,2.361722603925213E-4,2.3617261781877006E-4,2.363239125264053E-4,2.3614954928455483E-4,2.3637703746512065E-4,2.3620864479495762E-4,2.3612499332492973E-4,2.3623204230611893E-4,2.3630414373063954E-4,2.3617341885568218E-4,2.3629990819577762E-4,2.3641592555151707E-4,2.3663535618876846E-4,2.3620823661977866E-4,2.3613713012922497E-4,2.362222709002404E-4,2.361611120599412E-4,2.3608934115479157E-4,2.361493909678507E-4,2.3638605301314237E-4,2.362563803832486E-4,2.3630044668255485E-4,2.361010912949482E-4,2.3614945101465854E-4,2.361370413326481E-4,2.362169715801618E-4,2.3625793189828055E-4,2.3620989018287192E-4,2.3617245049795425E-4,2.3613762528140638E-4,2.3662143292745198E-4,2.3619704431003985E-4,2.3614939688950418E-4,2.3619577938738517E-4,2.3612523491289714E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276126E-4,2.3613795678840868E-4,2.3612510012659143E-4,2.3631400587089345E-4,2.3621914350507268E-4,2.3612500142009964E-4,2.3610099510202473E-4,2.360772525389538E-4,2.3629070374590536E-4,2.3613656901327567E-4,2.3624390791467605E-4,2.3631323951260914E-4,2.3620602879437978E-4,2.361497096615575E-4,2.3610130461469635E-4,2.361617036906907E-4,2.361011774476095E-4,2.361135676555683E-4,2.3610131129695174E-4,2.3625457404084343E-4,2.3618425711895646E-4,2.3612531658619864E-4,2.361481897497643E-4]}}

In all fairness, the story line does have a fine twist to it, and you might nod saying, \"Well, that's not what I expected.\" But, as a film, well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element. Casting, acting, camera work, cars, costume, setting, script, no, there's nothing to congratulate. Rated R?? Oh, that scene. Did we need it?

{"value":"A terrible storyline (Amis at his worst), pointless and self-conscious 'decadence', obvious shock tactics and patchy acting make this film (rather like \"Rancid Aluminium\") embody everything that went wrong with the much-vaunted British film revival.

{"value":"I got this DVD from a friend, who got it from someone else (and that probably keeps going on..) Even the cover of the DVD looks cheap, as is the entire movie. Gunshots and fist fights with delayed sound effects, some of the worst actors I´ve seen in my life, a very simple plot, it made me laugh ´till my stomach hurt! With very few financial resources, I must admit it looked pretty professional. Seen as a movie, it was one of the 13 in a dozen wannabe gangsta flicks nobody´s waiting for. So: if you´re tired and want a cheap laugh, see this movie. If not, throw it out of the window.","finished_norm":["i","get","thi","dvd","from","a","friend","who","get","it","from","someon","els","and","that","probabl","keep","go","on","even","the","cover","of","the","dvd","look","cheap","a","be","the","entir","movi","gunshot","and","fist","fight","with","delai","sound","effect","some","of","the","wrong","actor","iv","see","in","my","life","a","veri","simpl","plot","it","make","me","laugh","till","my","stomach","hurt","with","veri","few","financi","resourc","i","must","admit","it","look","pretti","profession","see","a","a","movi","it","be","on","of","the","in","a","dozen","wannab","gangsta","flick","nobodi","wait","for","so","if","your","tire","and","want","a","cheap","laugh","see","thi","movi","if","not","throw","it","out","of","the","window"],"filtered":["get","thi","dvd","friend","get","someon","els","probabl","keep","go","even","cover","dvd","look","cheap","entir","movi","gunshot","fist","fight","delai","sound","effect","wrong","actor","iv","see","life","veri","simpl","plot","make","laugh","till","stomach","hurt","veri","financi","resourc","must","admit","look","pretti","profession","see","movi","dozen","wannab","gangsta","flick","nobodi","wait","tire","want","cheap","laugh","see","thi","movi","throw","window"],"filtered2":["get","dvd","friend","get","someon","els","probabl","keep","go","even","cover","dvd","look","cheap","entir","gunshot","fist","fight","delai","sound","effect","wrong","actor","iv","see","life","veri","simpl","plot","make","laugh","till","stomach","hurt","veri","financi","resourc","must","admit","look","pretti","profession","see","dozen","wannab","gangsta","flick","nobodi","wait","tire","want","cheap","laugh","see","throw","window"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,15,16,25,32,37,41,75,78,106,133,134,139,141,148,161,178,196,198,233,247,257,310,331,351,491,691,736,863,866,900,1160,1323,1357,1825,1920,1926,2930,2971,3043,3044,5233,5758],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,15,16,25,32,37,41,75,78,106,133,134,139,141,148,161,178,196,198,233,247,257,310,331,351,491,691,736,863,866,900,1160,1323,1357,1825,1920,1926,2930,2971,3043,3044,5233,5758],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.967100616408184,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,2.4001215597131385,2.393227744058217,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.9742250248702675,2.0064197866819473,2.159084361316692,4.642472950759303,2.2443961816702407,2.2939035841256437,2.2657547357741192,2.3018654096236517,2.4323182980210873,2.532833256045391,2.478925055209576,2.5439726117360975,2.8377834061292515,5.460751613699401,2.7602659523229094,2.854312708080462,2.932274249550174,6.027137983886841,3.369778711402955,3.5929222627171646,3.6841709341823097,3.944626193933877,3.8962296530720266,3.9201351739255808,4.2574141875167335,4.383707912841026,4.477736862489302,4.798834931860927,4.8184434032493035,4.890269137820559,5.408212229355414,5.463272006538442,5.719991853386255,5.444579873526289,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805357E-4,2.19255310437206E-4,2.1930944626706036E-4,2.192653580532819E-4,2.1928610891855602E-4,2.192541015295697E-4,2.1932229259911853E-4,2.1922148009526651E-4,2.1925535677457444E-4,2.1948193342720786E-4,2.212234586864771E-4,2.1925571892772596E-4,2.1946336794909408E-4,2.1948623224568863E-4,2.1938652538130768E-4,2.1926622170779193E-4,2.1934165776813397E-4,2.1944488069798184E-4,2.1927754147741063E-4,2.19276739776963E-4,2.1947401253786465E-4,2.192987090676411E-4,2.1929904095723224E-4,2.1943952627086742E-4,2.1927762057634127E-4,2.1948885564790862E-4,2.1933249395190827E-4,2.192548190405608E-4,2.1935421980567513E-4,2.1942116987548022E-4,2.192997847633018E-4,2.19417236952427E-4,2.195249653380588E-4,2.1972871854514223E-4,2.1933211493919245E-4,2.1926608871935258E-4,2.1934514652716488E-4,2.1928835723826446E-4,2.1922171407356015E-4,2.192774735707244E-4,2.1949722707154413E-4,2.193768190257819E-4,2.1941773696650528E-4,2.1923262471379974E-4,2.1927752932743102E-4,2.1926600626693142E-4,2.1934022582203956E-4,2.1937825969134964E-4,2.1933365036190088E-4,2.1929888559081093E-4,2.1926654849491637E-4,2.1971579004444688E-4,2.1932172227464696E-4,2.192774790692997E-4,2.1932054772559205E-4,2.1925504336804655E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630274E-4,2.192668563170862E-4,2.192549182116764E-4,2.1943032740576228E-4,2.193422425717135E-4,2.192548265573636E-4,2.19232535393471E-4,2.1921048914035575E-4,2.1940869012321298E-4,2.192655676928649E-4,2.1936523766456572E-4,2.1942961580067303E-4,2.1933006485397492E-4,2.1927776949505677E-4,2.19232822792716E-4,2.1928890659939348E-4,2.1923270471120237E-4,2.1924420968899246E-4,2.192328289975513E-4,2.1937514173922448E-4,2.1930984867656847E-4,2.192551192061215E-4,2.192763581748044

{"value":"Not much to say on this one. A plot you can pretty much peg, in the first 10 minutes. Nothing overly wrong with this film, very little action for an action film. There was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally. Whether an action film is the right genre to do that with, I'm still undecided. Sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to, as it had little twists and a straightforward plot. I was probably guilty of that, so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be better.<br /><br />4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10's)","finished_norm":["not","much","to","sai","on","thi","on","a","plot","you","can","pretti","much","peg","in","the","minut","noth","overli","wrong","with","thi","film","veri","littl","action","for","a","action","film","there","be","a","chanc","to","explor","the","charact","emot","occasion","whether","a","action","film","be","the","right","genr","to","do","that","with","i","be","still","undecid","sniper","be","on","of","the","easi","film","to","watch","without","give","full","attent","to","a","it","have","littl","twist","and","a","straightforward","plot","i","be","probabl","guilti","of","that","so","with","a","watch","or","with","undivid","attent","it","mai","be","betterbr","br","but","the","well","of","my","out","of"],"filtered":["much","sai","thi","plot","pretti","much","peg","minut","noth","overli","wrong","thi","film","veri","littl","action","action","film","chanc","explor","charact","emot","occasion","whether","action","film","right","genr","still","undecid","sniper","easi","film","watch","without","give","full","attent","littl","twist","straightforward","plot","probabl","guilti","watch","undivid","attent","mai","betterbr","br","well"],"filtered2":["plot","pretti","peg","minut","noth","overli","wrong","veri","littl","action","action","chanc","explor","charact","emot","occasion","whether","action","right","genr","still","undecid","sniper","easi","watch","without","give","full","attent","littl","twist","straightforward","plot","probabl","guilti","watch","undivid","attent","mai","betterbr","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,10,14,15,20,25,30,32,46,49,59,64,78,121,125,129,148,336,435,467,486,506,597,636,744,1099,1291,1716,2038,2169,4670,4922,7856],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,10,14,15,20,25,30,32,46,49,59,64,78,121,125,129,148,336,435,467,486,506,597,636,744,1099,1291,1716,2038,2169,4670,4922,7856],"values":[1.9218995441445863,1.1238870241028365,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,2.742262257014735,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,1.8693254449200722,1.883428577602134,2.0064197866819473,2.2190595059394194,2.2242236634876535,7.232087502023765,2.3018654096236517,2.9233055795674137,3.2829611516442836,3.342254038012865,3.3066947359763783,3.449627639403373,3.4986697244709752,7.061861173378394,3.700222643192818,4.135246553542527,4.449957298382227,4.715065048795469,4.979216623837056,4.956227105612356,6.214688095222362,6.137727054086234,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.0725958754263525E-4,3.0698730928850723E-4,3.0706310682659173E-4,3.070013773200535E-4,3.0703043135885057E-4,3.069856166530965E-4,3.0708109344185274E-4,3.0693994220023195E-4,3.069873741671368E-4,3.073046123530709E-4,3.0974298500792305E-4,3.0698788123089413E-4,3.072786181540687E-4,3.073106312846804E-4,3.0717102808896823E-4,3.0700258655404493E-4,3.0710820731707936E-4,3.0725273348352743E-4,3.070184357738886E-4,3.0701731328402603E-4,3.0729352202872807E-4,3.070480732844055E-4,3.070485379750548E-4,3.072452365559987E-4,3.0701854652316916E-4,3.0731430440524054E-4,3.0709537672574577E-4,3.069866212662486E-4,3.0712579588127993E-4,3.072195351013023E-4,3.070495794048996E-4,3.072140284731465E-4,3.073648628915839E-4,3.076501451439349E-4,3.0709484605630113E-4,3.0700240035210944E-4,3.071130920550842E-4,3.0703357931278764E-4,3.069402698017238E-4,3.070183406952752E-4,3.073260255389803E-4,3.071574378686907E-4,3.072147285609857E-4,3.069555461846907E-4,3.070184187622616E-4,3.0700228490748526E-4,3.0710620239743705E-4,3.0715945499678373E-4,3.070969958573023E-4,3.070483204408955E-4,3.0700304410054556E-4,3.07632043481386E-4,3.0708029490988286E-4,3.070183483940299E-4,3.0707865038116756E-4,3.0698693535529444E-4,0.975736691592068,3.0703483044379584E-4,3.0700347509352575E-4,3.0698676011932304E-4,3.072323568914583E-4,3.0710902612177327E-4,3.0698663179079674E-4,3.069554211240601E-4,3.069245533657821E-4,3.07202061747697E-4,3.0700167084403413E-4,3.0714122238496735E-4,3.0723136054737346E-4,3.070919756576618E-4,3.070187550296618E-4,3.069558235221627E-4,3.0703434849322156E-4,3.069556581919545E-4,3.0697176672847364E-4,3.0695583220977763E-4,3.071550894389713E-4,3.070636702547335E-4,3.069870415389327E-4,3.0701677898900873E-4]}}
{"value":"Jeff Lowell has written & directed 'Over Her Dead Body' poorly. The idea is first of all, is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake.<br /><br />Minus Eva Longoria Parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film. Eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance.<br /><br />Paul Rudd looks jaded and least interested. Lake Bell is a complete miscast. She looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance. Jason Biggs is wasted, so is Lindsay Sloane.<br /><br />I expected entertainment more from this film. Sadly, I didn't get entertained.","finished_norm":["jeff","lowel","have","write","direct","over","her","dead","bodi","poorli","the","idea","be","of","all","be","a","stale","a","my","joke","and","the","execut","be","just","a","cherri","on","the","cakebr","br","minu","eva","longoria","parker","there","be","hardli","anyth","appeal","in","thi","film","eva","look","great","a","ever","and","deliv","a","likabl","performancebr","br","paul","rudd","look","jade","and","littl","interest","lake","bell","be","a","complet","miscast","she","look","manli","and","deliv","a","strictli","averag","perform","jason","bigg","be","wast","so","be","lindsai","sloanebr","br","i","expect","entertain","much","from","thi","film","sadli","i","do","not","get","entertain"],"filtered":["jeff","lowel","write","direct","dead","bodi","poorli","idea","stale","joke","execut","cherri","cakebr","br","minu","eva","longoria","parker","hardli","anyth","appeal","thi","film","eva","look","great","ever","deliv","likabl","performancebr","br","paul","rudd","look","jade","littl","interest","lake","bell","complet","miscast","look","manli","deliv","strictli","averag","perform","jason","bigg","wast","lindsai","sloanebr","br","expect","entertain","much","thi","film","sadli","get","entertain"],"filtered2":["jeff","lowel","write","direct","dead","bodi","poorli","idea","stale","joke","execut","cherri","cakebr","minu","eva","longoria","parker","hardli","anyth","appeal","eva","look","great","ever","deliv","likabl","performancebr","paul","rudd","look","jade","littl","interest","lake","bell","complet","miscast","look","manli","deliv","strictli","averag","perform","jason","bigg","wast","lindsai","sloanebr","expect","entertain","sadli","get","entertain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,14,16,44,51,60,65,89,102,103,104,105,123,130,195,214,228,376,398,517,643,662,665,690,706,840,1339,1438,1439,1541,1869,1947,2025,2335,2877,2936,3227,3992,4423,4719,5965,6886,7157,7860,7905],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,14,16,44,51,60,65,89,102,103,104,105,123,130,195,214,228,376,398,517,643,662,665,690,706,840,1339,1438,1439,1541,1869,1947,2025,2335,2877,2936,3227,3992,4423,4719,5965,6886,7157,7860,7905],"values":[0.7966340470719924,1.1175081997259209,3.589841616087325,1.604729392502474,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,1.9940046109572438,2.087553710177271,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.1765612129984904,2.2619070973220485,2.2642139034199635,5.02578483168376,2.7303758068497004,2.7742700004069256,3.1569204307489187,3.143848349181566,6.839697528095523,3.5813614403160887,3.616452760127359,3.5929222627171646,3.634471265630037,3.6284289511740746,4.049068857301474,4.506310234933358,4.828393734102471,4.513582994262438,4.605250182788262,4.979216623837056,5.089758498236879,5.259176650194926,5.0768550934009715,5.390512652256013,11.540004547921834,5.541743621979936,6.255510089742618,6.255510089742618,6.1754673820690815,6.660975197850782,6.660975197850782,6.660975197850782,7.0356686472921925,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006071E-4,2.4075667160687809E-4,2.4081611628889936E-4,2.4076770454650997E-4,2.407904903538247E-4,2.4075534414722287E-4,2.4083022240173427E-4,2.4071952367870053E-4,2.4075672248833943E-4,2.410055184725419E-4,2.4291782711448494E-4,2.4075712015618697E-4,2.4098513236326798E-4,2.4101023885640492E-4,2.4090075419782656E-4,2.407686528956507E-4,2.408514866239233E-4,2.4096483215235828E-4,2.4078108274307977E-4,2.4078020242355175E-4,2.4099682081796454E-4,2.4080432614165316E-4,2.40804690578132E-4,2.409589526411717E-4,2.4078116959887924E-4,2.4101311952363032E-4,2.4084142415433334E-4,2.4075613202122106E-4,2.408652805627838E-4,2.4093879611840696E-4,2.4080550732584623E-4,2.4093447751165535E-4,2.410527703252277E-4,0.13884134365872014,2.408410079735814E-4,2.4076850686564593E-4,2.4085531750952713E-4,2.4079295915591955E-4,2.4071978060217065E-4,2.4078100817709672E-4,2.4102231189432859E-4,2.4089009598459943E-4,2.4093502655981753E-4,2.4073176119878174E-4,2.4078106940160748E-4,2.4076841632749457E-4,2.4084991425345288E-4,2.4089167792962186E-4,2.4084269396814205E-4,2.4080451997563943E-4,2.4076901172928733E-4,2.4126230833403916E-4,2.408295961481615E-4,2.4078101421489206E-4,2.408283064164759E-4,2.4075637834747294E-4,0.8423712850884818,2.4079394036305148E-4,2.4076934973816342E-4,2.4075624091759245E-4,2.409488516856197E-4,2.4085212877650365E-4,2.4075614027516218E-4,2.4073166311921863E-4,2.4070745489132738E-4,2.4092509253415922E-4,2.4076793474448388E-4,2.4087737889248647E-4,2.40948070296688E-4,2.4083875684592342E-4,2.4078133312136908E-4,2.4073197870238744E-4,2.4079356239037106E-4,2.407318490411622E-4,2.407444822592773E-4,2.4073198551570246E-4,2.4088825421425373E-4,2.408165581608595E-4,2.4075646162263954E-4,2.407797833994223E-4]}}

{"value":"This film concerns purportedly non-establishment types (aesthetically and sexually) who apparently cannot resist basic romantic needs. Although some excellent players take part, including Jon Tenney, Timothy Olyphant, and Cynthia Nixon, they are grounded by a puerile script which relies nearly totally upon clever dialogue; which isn't. Nixon's role possesses the best lines, but she often homes in on them too quickly, a timing flaw which must be saddled upon the director. The grotesque climax utilizes every available cliche, spent or not, and fittingly ends this drab attempt at comedy.","finished_norm":["thi","film","concern","purportedli","nonestablish","typ","aesthet","and","sexual","who","appar","cannot","resist","basic","romant","ne","although","some","excel","player","take","part","includ","jon","tennei","timothi","olyph","and","cynthia","nixon","thei","be","ground","by","a","pueril","script","which","reli","nearli","total","upon","clever","dialogu","which","be","not","nixon","role","possess","the","well","line","but","she","often","home","in","on","them","too","quickli","a","time","flaw","which","must","be","saddl","upon","the","director","the","grotesqu","climax","util","everi","avail","clich","spend","or","not","and","fittingli","end","thi","drab","attempt","at","comedi"],"filtered":["thi","film","concern","purportedli","nonestablish","typ","aesthet","sexual","appar","resist","basic","romant","ne","although","excel","player","take","part","includ","jon","tennei","timothi","olyph","cynthia","nixon","thei","ground","pueril","script","reli","nearli","total","upon","clever","dialogu","nixon","role","possess","well","line","often","home","quickli","time","flaw","must","saddl","upon","director","grotesqu","climax","util","everi","avail","clich","spend","fittingli","end","thi","drab","attempt","comedi"],"filtered2":["concern","purportedli","nonestablish","typ","aesthet","sexual","appar","resist","basic","romant","ne","although","excel","player","take","part","includ","jon","tennei","timothi","olyph","cynthia","nixon","ground","pueril","script","reli","nearli","total","upon","clever","dialogu","nixon","role","possess","well","line","often","home","quickli","time","flaw","must","saddl","upon","director","grotesqu","climax","util","everi","avail","clich","spend","fittingli","end","drab","attempt","comedi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,20,24,31,58,61,77,85,107,110,127,128,141,177,184,237,248,283,286,301,302,308,384,400,519,580,611,630,770,864,874,923,955,999,1136,1305,1426,1581,1586,2174,2567,2921,3329,3619,3689,3696,4018,4410,5290,6773,7005],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,20,24,31,58,61,77,85,107,110,127,128,141,177,184,237,248,283,286,301,302,308,384,400,519,580,611,630,770,864,874,923,955,999,1136,1305,1426,1581,1586,2174,2567,2921,3329,3619,3689,3696,4018,4410,5290,6773,7005],"values":[0.9418936859054116,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.865701314626681,1.8818517047392527,1.9463902258768238,2.011190219103739,2.1439533986393955,2.1290479736304078,2.4359679371086367,2.3409902041158843,2.2657547357741192,2.458149992634611,2.496249838866882,2.640097787510554,2.689504733779216,2.7678802023081546,2.780700890737216,2.8309760279012264,2.902686292364678,2.8753661172782943,3.109204957709252,3.130944944345658,3.5614461306151473,3.5039747767006686,3.520060914452293,7.117266378477066,3.7264536553416874,3.9782428047328615,3.872882289075035,3.9911462095687695,4.017463517886143,4.1302590120314875,4.181290492043933,4.4637506205145625,4.449957298382227,4.671389985292807,4.589376833631972,5.0768550934009715,5.444579873526289,5.408212229355414,5.583416318380505,5.695894301807195,5.7959777603641776,5.7959777603641776,5.7959777603641776,5.967828017290836,6.214688095222362,13.737229125258052,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255702E-4,2.2737792632708263E-4,2.2743406769354594E-4,2.2738834617097746E-4,2.2740986578072424E-4,2.2737667263379274E-4,2.274473899357232E-4,2.2734284269338727E-4,2.2737797438108291E-4,2.2761294487884273E-4,2.2941898734776011E-4,2.2737834995069825E-4,2.275936916169429E-4,2.2761740295299318E-4,2.2751400231007008E-4,2.2738924182076202E-4,2.2746747251417898E-4,2.275745194800719E-4,2.274009809468852E-4,2.2740014954633687E-4,2.276047305492106E-4,2.2742293271974006E-4,2.2742327690463963E-4,2.2756896669080755E-4,2.27401062976145E-4,2.2762012354277282E-4,2.2745796921172084E-4,2.2737741672596977E-4,2.2748049992975608E-4,2.2754993025739275E-4,2.2742404826603266E-4,2.2754585163377143E-4,2.2765757096628237E-4,2.2786887249241983E-4,2.274575761579553E-4,2.2738910390558218E-4,2.274710905191081E-4,2.274121973925425E-4,2.2734308533973007E-4,2.2740091052450193E-4,2.2762880509736254E-4,2.2750393636919393E-4,2.2754637017156207E-4,2.2735440017971104E-4,2.274009683467928E-4,2.2738901839859717E-4,2.2746598751966317E-4,2.2750543040620799E-4,2.2745916846251925E-4,2.274231157824546E-4,2.2738958071416693E-4,2.278554650375547E-4,2.2744679848279363E-4,2.2740091622677956E-4,2.2744558042094625E-4,2.2737764936397718E-4,0.9820287660606669,2.274131240744137E-4,2.2738989994003432E-4,2.2737751957101638E-4,2.2755942704103581E-4,2.2746807898261508E-4,2.2737742452124294E-4,2.2735430755038734E-4,2.2733144456336718E-4,2.2753698817546122E-4,2.2738856357694843E-4,2.2749192596045113E-4,2.275586890735529E-4,2.274554501

{"value":"I was thrilled to watch this movie expecting it to be the sequel to the cult classic \"Private Lessons\" which portrays the dream of any male teenager.<br /><br />\"Private Lessons II\" has NOTHING to do with the title I mention. It's just a regular soft-core Cinemax flick that won't make a change in your life. There's just one hot sex scene in a rooftop but that's it. I watched this a long time ago but believe me, this is just a regular boring soft core flick.<br /><br />The women are hot but that's not enough to rent or buy the movie. My advice is to watch this only if it airs on cable.","finished_norm":["i","be","thrill","to","watch","thi","movi","expect","it","to","be","the","sequel","to","the","cult","classic","privat","lesson","which","portrai","the","dream","of","ani","male","teenagerbr","br","privat","lesson","ii","have","noth","to","do","with","the","titl","i","mention","it","just","a","regular","softcor","cinemax","flick","that","wo","not","make","a","chang","in","your","life","there","just","on","hot","sex","scene","in","a","rooftop","but","that","it","i","watch","thi","a","long","time","ago","but","believ","me","thi","be","just","a","regular","bore","soft","core","flickbr","br","the","woman","be","hot","but","that","not","enough","to","rend","or","bui","the","movi","my","advic","be","to","watch","thi","onli","if","it","air","on","cabl"],"filtered":["thrill","watch","thi","movi","expect","sequel","cult","classic","privat","lesson","portrai","dream","ani","male","teenagerbr","br","privat","lesson","ii","noth","titl","mention","regular","softcor","cinemax","flick","wo","make","chang","life","hot","sex","scene","rooftop","watch","thi","long","time","ago","believ","thi","regular","bore","soft","core","flickbr","br","woman","hot","enough","rend","bui","movi","advic","watch","thi","onli","air","cabl"],"filtered2":["thrill","watch","expect","sequel","cult","classic","privat","lesson","portrai","dream","ani","male","teenagerbr","privat","lesson","ii","noth","titl","mention","regular","softcor","cinemax","flick","wo","make","chang","life","hot","sex","scene","rooftop","watch","long","time","ago","believ","regular","bore","soft","core","flickbr","woman","hot","enough","rend","bui","advic","watch","onli","air","cabl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,11,19,27,49,70,75,91,93,99,108,130,254,257,264,278,285,332,347,387,406,469,533,607,610,649,666,679,933,1169,1218,1272,1283,1533,1689,1759,1990,2208,3538,4537,7185],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,11,19,27,49,70,75,91,93,99,108,130,254,257,264,278,285,332,347,387,406,469,533,607,610,649,666,679,933,1169,1218,1272,1283,1533,1689,1759,1990,2208,3538,4537,7185],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.312380678011735,1.3002700588679295,1.6920303308087352,2.094675786251684,1.9742250248702675,2.0105926690411424,2.035389827120098,2.056430207256609,2.138507503627933,2.2642139034199635,2.889652074525771,2.7602659523229094,2.757740698455715,2.8336934208777267,2.808171552082607,2.9705344631698933,3.0151989841543516,3.360519385990158,3.121829110937649,3.328770687675578,3.424750734647968,3.68099128126493,3.477726550625732,3.6375061693251913,7.324245593921095,3.6715125373103863,4.091229668125752,4.528289141652134,4.297765483040301,8.832568166551278,4.3773181147422555,4.558366596889411,9.48443207572284,9.502865385932687,4.956227105612356,5.039114765418124,5.695894301807195,5.999576715605417,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815707E-4,2.4557311712357507E-4,2.4563375102320054E-4,2.455843707821273E-4,2.456076124297672E-4,2.455717631074923E-4,2.456481393351682E-4,2.4553522603438377E-4,2.455731690229429E-4,2.4582694228272693E-4,2.4777750751927874E-4,2.4557357464631465E-4,2.458061483401666E-4,2.458317570999926E-4,2.457200821515691E-4,2.4558533810341916E-4,2.4566982895768755E-4,2.4578544201440586E-4,2.455980166155375E-4,2.455971186848213E-4,2.4581807062765723E-4,2.456217250087551E-4,2.4562209673594963E-4,2.4577944488095315E-4,2.455981052089263E-4,2.4583469539626163E-4,2.4565956518386695E-4,2.4557256674326424E-4,2.4568389885049996E-4,2.457588851178834E-4,2.4562292982306926E-4,2.45754480115461E-4,2.4587513942998134E-4,2.461033496844451E-4,2.4565914067723187E-4,2.4558518915201847E-4,2.4567373648188114E-4,2.4561013062135857E-4,2.4553548809772355E-4,2.455979405578284E-4,2.4584407166447074E-4,2.457092107159919E-4,2.457550401475787E-4,2.455477083715591E-4,2.45598003007163E-4,2.455850968026107E-4,2.4566822513123857E-4,2.4571082430853615E-4,2.456608604008721E-4,2.456219227204774E-4,2.4558570411568415E-4,2.4608886934091695E-4,2.45647500553111E-4,2.455979467164125E-4,2.4564618501976283E-4,2.455728179973836E-4,0.9805906755843552,2.4561113145798053E-4,2.4558604888657985E-4,2.4557267781815653E-4,2.4576914185124154E-4,2.4567048395681914E-4,2.4557257516232917E-4,2.4554760832987024E-4,2.455229158054903E-4,2.4574490738726835E-4,2.455846055853152E-4,2.456962392127306E-4,2.457683448302728E-4,2.456568445147524E-4,2.455982720027571E-4,2.455479302264223E-4,2.4561074592378666E-4,2.455477979712659E-4,2.455606839225923E-4,2.4554793717604075E-4,2.4570733210020195E-4,2.4563420173500804E-4,2.4557290293850733E-4,2.4559669127792563E-4]}}

{"value":"Before seeing this movie, I would've said that I loved everything Kathy Bates has done. Now it's everything-minus-one. James Woods is pathetic...not his character, his acting. Someone should've told him that \"poor\" is not synonymous with dirty, nor ignorant, nor cliche. Ditto for Randy Quaid's stereotyping. The only redeeming feature is Henry Thomas, who isn't a strong enough actor to carry this sodden mess. If you enjoy the country, you'll enjoy the scenery. That's the best I can give it.<br /><br />I'm a serious fan of both independent and quirky films, but this is simply terrible.","finished_norm":["befor","see","thi","movi","i","would","have","sai","that","i","love","everyth","kathi","bate","have","do","now","it","everythingminuson","jame","wood","be","patheticnot","hi","charact","hi","act","someon","should","have","tell","him","that","poor","be","not","synonym","with","dirti","nor","ignor","nor","clich","ditto","for","randi","quaid","stereotyp","the","onli","redeem","featur","be","henri","thoma","who","be","not","a","strong","enough","actor","to","carri","thi","sodden","mess","if","you","enjoi","the","countri","you","will","enjoi","the","sceneri","that","the","well","i","can","give","itbr","br","i","be","a","seriou","fan","of","both","independ","and","quirki","film","but","thi","be","simpli","terribl"],"filtered":["befor","see","thi","movi","sai","love","everyth","kathi","bate","everythingminuson","jame","wood","patheticnot","hi","charact","hi","act","someon","tell","poor","synonym","dirti","ignor","clich","ditto","randi","quaid","stereotyp","onli","redeem","featur","henri","thoma","strong","enough","actor","carri","thi","sodden","mess","enjoi","countri","enjoi","sceneri","well","give","itbr","br","seriou","fan","independ","quirki","film","thi","simpli","terribl"],"filtered2":["befor","see","love","everyth","kathi","bate","everythingminuson","jame","wood","patheticnot","charact","act","someon","tell","poor","synonym","dirti","ignor","clich","ditto","randi","quaid","stereotyp","onli","redeem","featur","henri","thoma","strong","enough","actor","carri","sodden","mess","enjoi","countri","enjoi","sceneri","well","give","itbr","seriou","fan","independ","quirki","simpli","terribl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,10,11,20,21,30,41,54,79,90,93,139,140,146,166,193,200,201,305,407,430,493,604,608,620,621,631,634,655,762,1138,1211,1581,1612,1634,1946,2722,4532,4655,5797,5866,7725],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,10,11,20,21,30,41,54,79,90,93,139,140,146,166,193,200,201,305,407,430,493,604,608,620,621,631,634,655,762,1138,1211,1581,1612,1634,1946,2722,4532,4655,5797,5866,7725],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3364419891718522,1.5687599167621034,1.8113893252729412,1.9469506069506084,2.0477128419653545,2.035389827120098,2.2939035841256437,2.317169775997098,2.326138445979858,2.4423870329693536,2.517840471459249,5.061642365863941,2.561435818751577,2.8612813773965557,3.120015873813468,3.1419947805322432,3.342254038012865,3.5727776966246974,3.616452760127359,3.7568101178222815,3.5446859617576822,3.607563812710113,3.5119855004467477,3.7297814454343623,3.7465885637507435,4.224077767249142,4.364659717870332,4.671389985292807,5.02684467282631,4.654440426979034,5.014723312293965,5.274680836730892,6.101359409915359,6.214688095222362,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.7931824809238E-4,2.7907073007172223E-4,2.791396347907476E-4,2.7908351879528013E-4,2.791099307399218E-4,2.790691913599073E-4,2.7915598575282497E-4,2.790276704158133E-4,2.790707890504681E-4,2.793591784707359E-4,2.815758122415371E-4,2.790712500032459E-4,2.793355481124973E-4,2.7936465005730534E-4,2.7923774199117705E-4,2.7908461806486754E-4,2.791806339670202E-4,2.7931201732250355E-4,2.790990260003717E-4,2.790980055866414E-4,2.7934909666990095E-4,2.791259683574243E-4,2.791263907903876E-4,2.793052021448873E-4,2.790991266784182E-4,2.793679891544125E-4,2.7916897015427494E-4,2.7907010461631016E-4,2.791966230757027E-4,2.792818379095948E-4,2.7912733751547466E-4,2.792768320390159E-4,2.794139499914512E-4,2.7967328946259943E-4,2.79168487742446E-4,2.7908444879562255E-4,2.791850745004233E-4,2.791127924276101E-4,2.7902796822612904E-4,2.7909893956794523E-4,2.7937864440057754E-4,2.792253876280489E-4,2.792774684627978E-4,2.7904185541696215E-4,2.7909901053573525E-4,2.7908434384921405E-4,2.7917881136924045E-4,2.7922722132407647E-4,2.7917044204647334E-4,2.7912619303818476E-4,2.7908503400335134E-4,2.7965683391531715E-4,2.7915525983715E-4,2.7909894656659635E-4,2.7915376485734036E-4,2.7907039014296445E-4,0.9779431299389859,2.7911392978421516E-4,2.790854258030186E-4,2.7907023084246897E-4,2.792934937215173E-4,2.791813783118735E-4,2.7907011418378495E-4,2.790417417290004E-4,2.79013680999525E-4,2.7926595353457373E-4,2.7908378562699956E-4,2.79210646735692E-4,2.7929258798221554E-4,2.7916587836994216E-4,2.7909931622390545E-4,2.790421075341294E-4,2.7911349166089683E-4,2.7904195723859427E-4,2.790566009092307E-4,2.790421154317165E-4,2.7922325275805103E-4,2.791401469822881E-4,2.790704866705555E-4,2.7909751987893934E-4]}}

{"value":"First off I really enjoyed Zombi 2 by Lucio Fulci. This film was utter trash. I couldn't stand to watch it. The storyline was a joke, the acting was a joke, and the fact that Zombi 3 has nothing to do with Zombi 2 is even more a joke.<br /><br />We jump from Voodoo to DEATH 1 THE HARMFUL AGENT BRINING People BACK TO LIFE. Whatever, this movie isn't worth the $1.00 it cost to rent it. I really enjoyed lucio fulci movies but this one was horrible. If Zombi 3 is an indicator for how zombi 4 and 5 are going to be I think I will just skip them.<br /><br />Zombi 2 is an awesome flique tho.","finished_norm":["off","i","realli","enjoi","zombi","by","lucio","fulci","thi","film","be","utter","trash","i","can","not","stand","to","watch","it","the","storylin","be","a","joke","the","act","be","a","joke","and","the","fact","that","zombi","have","noth","to","do","with","zombi","be","even","much","a","jokebr","br","we","jump","from","voodoo","to","death","the","harm","agent","brine","peopl","back","to","life","whatev","thi","movi","be","not","worth","the","it","cost","to","rend","it","i","realli","enjoi","lucio","fulci","movi","but","thi","on","be","horribl","if","zombi","be","a","indic","for","how","zombi","and","be","go","to","be","i","think","i","will","just","skip","thembr","br","zombi","be","a","awesom","fliqu","tho"],"filtered":["realli","enjoi","zombi","lucio","fulci","thi","film","utter","trash","stand","watch","storylin","joke","act","joke","fact","zombi","noth","zombi","even","much","jokebr","br","jump","voodoo","death","harm","agent","brine","peopl","back","life","whatev","thi","movi","worth","cost","rend","realli","enjoi","lucio","fulci","movi","thi","horribl","zombi","indic","zombi","go","think","skip","thembr","br","zombi","awesom","fliqu","tho"],"filtered2":["realli","enjoi","zombi","lucio","fulci","utter","trash","stand","watch","storylin","joke","act","joke","fact","zombi","noth","zombi","even","jokebr","jump","voodoo","death","harm","agent","brine","peopl","back","life","whatev","worth","cost","rend","realli","enjoi","lucio","fulci","horribl","zombi","indic","zombi","go","think","skip","thembr","zombi","awesom","fliqu","tho"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,7,12,13,21,23,49,63,75,97,200,214,219,230,245,268,377,515,533,557,671,674,836,931,1024,1069,1369,1419,1679,2069,2806,3991,5343,5792,6261],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,7,12,13,21,23,49,63,75,97,200,214,219,230,245,268,377,515,533,557,671,674,836,931,1024,1069,1369,1419,1679,2069,2806,3991,5343,5792,6261],"values":[0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.6920303308087352,1.8729627573220065,1.9742250248702675,2.0545557924622586,5.061642365863941,5.460751613699401,2.5792094178355414,2.7121382192999195,2.7502029743242886,22.047972877279694,3.0602441305135506,3.3956930001684253,3.424750734647968,3.4471119148061256,3.6466665387238555,3.6405503117064195,3.7881170224473255,3.9241755834625858,4.072271754381138,4.2860694432771105,4.383707912841026,4.436351646326448,4.706176101378222,11.540004547921834,5.390512652256013,5.907203395474402,12.778082964734281,6.437831646536572,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6148425534859365E-4,2.6125254093050933E-4,2.6131704620099345E-4,2.612645131159259E-4,2.612892387030442E-4,2.612511004628139E-4,2.613323531820884E-4,2.6121223056003475E-4,2.6125259614356313E-4,2.615225723922477E-4,2.6359767788534385E-4,2.6125302766529386E-4,2.615004507919948E-4,2.6152769462736643E-4,2.6140888942435543E-4,2.61265542199029E-4,2.6135542764993484E-4,2.6147842240272444E-4,2.6127903021247657E-4,2.6127807495041885E-4,2.6151313429716475E-4,2.6130425234607987E-4,2.6130464780742046E-4,2.6147204236255087E-4,2.612791244624018E-4,2.615308205288303E-4,2.613445085516981E-4,2.6125195540935633E-4,2.613703958813557E-4,2.614501698937488E-4,2.613055340857288E-4,2.6144548363945055E-4,2.6157384684497806E-4,2.618166279341437E-4,2.6134405694103993E-4,2.6126538373733596E-4,2.613595846628696E-4,2.6129191767686465E-4,2.6121250935567085E-4,2.6127894929861274E-4,2.6154079545573914E-4,2.6139732386619755E-4,2.6144607942866176E-4,2.6122550987310453E-4,2.6127901573523067E-4,2.612652854915763E-4,2.6135372142190824E-4,2.613990404838679E-4,2.6134588646609537E-4,2.613044626813578E-4,2.612659315805515E-4,2.6180122304543036E-4,2.6133167361488865E-4,2.61278955850412E-4,2.6133027408698466E-4,2.6125222270562175E-4,0.979351423393872,2.612929824151944E-4,2.612662983644796E-4,2.612520735761906E-4,2.614610815020016E-4,2.613561244696415E-4,2.612519643659642E-4,2.6122540344392483E-4,2.611991343440664E-4,2.6143529970892404E-4,2.6126476291089606E-4,2.613835241546233E-4,2.614602335926062E-4,2.613416141725107E-4,2.6127930190573365E-4,2.612257458930216E-4,2.612925722653011E-4,2.6122560519359947E-4,2.6123931389089404E-4,2.6122575328636126E-4,2.6139532530400025E-4,2.613175256899795E-4,2.6125231307009113E-4,2.6127762025432346E-4]}}
