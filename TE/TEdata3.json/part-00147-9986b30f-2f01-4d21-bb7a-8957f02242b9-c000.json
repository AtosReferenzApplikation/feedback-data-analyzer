{"value":"Yes I have rated this film as one star awful. Yet, it will be in my rotation of Christmas movies henceforth. This truly is so bad it's good. This is another K.Gordon Murray production (read: buys a really cheap/bad Mexican movie, spends zero money getting it dubbed into English and releases it at kiddie matinées in the mid 1960's.) It's a shame I stumbled on this so late in life as I'm sure some \"mood enhancers\" would make this an even better experience. I'm not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said, a Christmas movie with Merlin, the Devil, mechanical wind-up reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors I have ever seen bar none. I plan on running this over the holidays back to back with Kelsey Grammar's \"A Christmas Carol\". Truly a holiday experience made in Hell. Now if I can only find \"To All A Goodnight (aka Slayride)\" on DVD I'll have a triple feature that can't be beat. You have to see this movie. It moves so slowly that I defy you not to touch the fast forward button-especially on the two dance routines! This thing reeks like an expensive bleu cheese-guess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience.

{"value":"This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen!!!! <br /><br />I can honestly say I have never seen a movie worse than this one!!!<br /><br />AND I MEAN NEVER!!!!<br /><br />I'm a BIG fan of \"B\" horror movies. As you may imagine.... I've been exposed to some of worst that the movie industry has to offer.<br /><br />I was lured to this movie by it's title. I mean c'mon... what true fan of horror wouldn't be intrigued by a title like \"Vampires vs. Zombies\"??? Images of the \"undead\" battling each other to the \"undeath\" danced in my head. I thought to myself... \"this I've got to see\"!!!!<br /><br />Well.... sorry to say.... \"this I wish I hadn't seen\"!!!!!<br /><br />This movies title is very misleading to say the least. There was no vampires fighting zombies. In fact, there is no plot!!!! If you were to ask me what this movie is all about I could honestly tell you I have no idea!!!<br /><br />There was no plot!!!! <br /><br />There was no story!!!! <br /><br />This movie absolutely makes no sense at all!!!!<br /><br />At the end of this debacle... I found myself feeling sorry for the poor souls who had invested their money into this project for they surely have no business

{"value":"9, the film I've been looking forward to for months.... was little more then a disappointment.<br /><br />I was deeply surprised by 9's lack of story and strange character development. All the awesome action sequences in the world don't make up for a single unsympathetic character. <br /><br />The strange, almost thrown in occult sequences were not only out of place, they were infuriating. The story is about robots and scientists... why does it suddenly turn into a necronomicon horror wannabe with mystical symbols and green magic ghost lines instead of giving answers to what could have been excellently scary story devices??<br /><br />How, what, when, why.... questions that bode asking only if you care and it becomes less and less likely that you will as you get away from the theater. <br /><br />A film like this is frustrating because of its lack of depth.... I would watch this film drawn in crayon if the story was good. But the filmmakers have relied on CGI wizardry and Tim Burtons name to draw in the crowd.

{"value":"A note to all of you budding film writers: Study this film. If your dialog reads like the dialog in this film, please shred your script and try again.<br /><br />I didn't have high expectations, but was intrigued by the description indicating there was a mystery at the Christmas Ornament Factory. The Mystery is resolved very early and the film becomes a straight romance. I almost stopped watching it at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and at the first break. My spouse , who is the Hallmark & Lifetime fan, gave up at the first break. <br /><br />Forest River is a company town - the main business is Aikens Ornaments, who make all manner of holiday decorations.The patriarch of the company has recently passed away, so the companies future might be in question. We soon meet Noelle, who would rather be on Wall Street than Main Street, and the mysterious Justin, who gets a date with Noelle after a large snowman she is inflating crashes into Justins car. Once we meet Alison Aikens, doing due diligence for the Board, we have our story setup.<br /><br />If you can't nail all the story arcs by the first commercial break, you haven't seen enough of this kind of Holiday film.

{"value":"Anyone who's watched a few Lifetime Movie Network movies knows that plot credibility is the first thing that gets brushed off the planning table. So, when crazed Lara moves into Patti's home and methodically begins to drive her landlady bonkers, I didn't even blink. When Lara eventually ramps up her activities to threatening poor Patti, and dares her to do anything about it, I just nodded. You see, on Planet LMN, people don't behave the way they do for any particular reason, they just do it to keep the action going. Only on Planet LMN could someone almost have the owner of a home thrown out of their own house by means of their seductive powers!! Poor Patti - she just trusted too much, and Lara went off her medicine, and then there was this big fight at the top of the stairs involving a syringe full of deadly stuff that ends up injected into someone's tummy, and a body bag going out the front door. The horror!<br /><br />But take it from me, this Planet LMN product is a classic. You need to watch it once, just for the great laughs you'll have. On the Improbability Scale, I give this film a 95/100. Make a big batch of popcorn and get some apple slices, too.

{"value":"What is this crap? My little cousin picked this out obviously for the overly girlie DVD art and title... I decided to watch it with her so she didn't get bored, and I sure was appalled at the horrible quality.<br /><br />First, the acting was terrible. They seem like amateur actresses reading off of cue cards. The delivery is sub-par and very formulaic. Scene cuts were terrible.. it looks like they took it straight from the story board, if there was one.<br /><br />Secondly, the jokes and stereotypes weren't original or well played at all- again, very formulaic. I can't count the times I was able to predict the next joke. I got a few chuckles out of the blatantly \"subtle\" sexual innuendos. The Cat, The Beaver Patch, Hung Wong?.. c'mon! Just.. stay away from this movie. It's not cute, it's not funny, it's not even stupid-funny. It's just stupid-stupid. It's like a PG kids' movie with unnecessary sexual innuendo, vulgarity, and violence to bump the MPAA rating.

{"value":"This is a typical low budget 1970's mess. It's supposed to be a docudrama about a crew hunting Bigfoot through the Pacific Northwest. Every character is a stereotype, from the Native American to the cynical cowboy. The acting and narration are a complete joke. If you're hoping to see a lot of bigfoot footage - keep hoping. There won't be much, and what there is you could do in your backyard with a cheap costume and a camcorder; it would look better than this movie.<br /><br />It's not that I don't like 1970's low budge fare; I do. It's that this is such a mess of bad acting, bad characters, lousy story and no thrills that you just can't enjoy it. It does not fit into the \"so bad it's good\" category, nor can you get a laugh out of how bad it is without the help of illicit substances. It's mostly a lot of boring footage of the people camping, hiking, riding horses, and watching wild life. There is a bigfoot attack which is completely stupid; supposedly our friend Sasquatch is throwing rocks down on the campers from above while they fire their rifles back at him. By that point you are rooting heavily for bigfoot to drops some rocks on the filmmaker's heads and stop the whole thing.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","typic","low","budget","mess","it","suppos","to","be","a","docudrama","about","a","crow","hunt","bigfoot","through","the","pacif","northwest","everi","charact","be","a","stereotyp","from","the","nativ","american","to","the","cynic","cowboi","the","act","and","narrat","be","a","complet","joke","if","you","re","hope","to","see","a","lot","of","bigfoot","footag","keep","hope","there","wo","not","be","much","and","what","there","be","you","can","do","in","your","backyard","with","a","cheap","costum","and","a","camcord","it","would","look","well","than","thi","moviebr","br","it","not","that","i","do","not","like","low","budg","fare","i","do","it","that","thi","be","such","a","mess","of","bad","act","bad","charact","lousi","stori","and","no","thrill","that","you","just","ca","not","enjoi","it","it","doe","not","fit","into","the","so","bad","it","good","categori","nor","can","you","get","a","laugh","out","of","how","bad","it","be","without","the","help","of","illicit","substanc","it","mostli","a","lot","of","bore","footag","of","the","peopl","camp","hike","ride","hors","and","watch","wild","life","there","be","a","bigfoot","attack","which","be","complet","stupid","supposedli","our","friend","sasquatch","be","throw","rock","down","on","the","camper","from","abov","while","thei","fire","their","rifl","back","at","him","by","that","point","you","be","root","heavili","for","bigfoot","to","drop","some","rock","on","the","filmmak","head","and","stop","the","whole","thing"],"filtered":["thi","typic","low","budget","mess","suppos","docudrama","crow","hunt","bigfoot","pacif","northwest","everi","charact","stereotyp","nativ","american","cynic","cowboi","act","narrat","complet","joke","re","hope","see","lot","bigfoot","footag","keep","hope","wo","much","backyard","cheap","costum","camcord","look","well","thi","moviebr","br","like","low","budg","fare","thi","mess","bad","act","bad","charact","lousi","stori","thrill","ca","enjoi","doe","fit","bad","good","categori","get","laugh","bad","without","help","illicit","substanc","mostli","lot","bore","footag","peopl","camp","hike","ride","hors","watch","wild","life","bigfoot","attack","complet","stupid","supposedli","friend","sasquatch","throw","rock","camper","abov","thei","fire","rifl","back","point","root","heavili","bigfoot","drop","rock","filmmak","head","stop","whole","thing"],"filtered2":["typic","low","budget","mess","suppos","docudrama","crow","hunt","bigfoot","pacif","northwest","everi","charact","stereotyp","nativ","american","cynic","cowboi","act","narrat","complet","joke","re","hope","see","lot","bigfoot","footag","keep","hope","wo","backyard","cheap","costum","camcord","look","well","moviebr","like","low","budg","fare","mess","bad","act","bad","charact","lousi","stori","thrill","ca","enjoi","doe","fit","bad","good","categori","get","laugh","bad","without","help","illicit","substanc","mostli","lot","bore","footag","peopl","camp","hike","ride","hors","watch","wild","life","bigfoot","attack","complet","stupid","supposedli","friend","sasquatch","throw","rock","camper","abov","fire","rifl","back","point","root","heavili","bigfoot","drop","rock","filmmak","head","stop","whole","thing"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,9,10,16,17,18,20,21,23,29,63,66,68,72,75,81,85,103,108,111,125,133,134,136,149,161,181,185,200,208,214,217,223,256,310,315,323,351,406,407,465,495,510,551,582,604,613,658,676,704,769,776,904,908,946,1002,1106,1117,1126,1214,1218,1247,1362,1364,1439,1473,1774,2099,2150,2391,2887,4406,4422,4492,4627,5115,5861,5865,6980],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,9,10,16,17,18,20,21,23,29,63,66,68,72,75,81,85,103,108,111,125,133,134,136,149,161,181,185,200,208,214,217,223,256,310,315,323,351,406,407,465,495,510,551,582,604,613,658,676,704,769,776,904,908,946,1002,1106,1117,1126,1214,1218,1247,1362,1364,1439,1473,1774,2099,2150,2391,2887,4406,4422,4492,4627,5115,5861,5865,6980],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,4.273428342688829,2.247774048205673,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,2.324031090670098,1.364847727375781,1.3195384777338066,1.8729627573220065,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,3.841892750832105,1.9742250248702675,1.949757232424728,2.011190219103739,4.197164082437498,2.138507503627933,2.1183455303375887,2.2242236634876535,2.3212364753796515,2.2443961816702407,2.346825985579986,2.3253197803590226,2.4323182980210873,4.888457308232007,2.518833027372001,2.5308211829319704,2.6289494000279396,2.7303758068497004,5.222733058940145,2.825563294

{"value":"This film was positively the worst film I have ever watched. I couldn't sit through the whole thing. I also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping... I mean what was that all about! I cant believe this was even made and am disgusted at have #ingwasted a £4 rental fee. The quality both picture and sound are terrible, the acting... well doesn't exist . It was a poor excuse for a film and the scenes of pee, crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh....... AVOID AT ALL COST! The girls looked like they had been picked off the street and only got the part cos they'd be willing to take their tops off... While these girls have nice bodies it certainly didn't make up for the fact their shrieking was awful unconvincing and a pain to my ears.<br /><br />This was like (possibly worse) than an ammateur school production without any proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car?! <br /><br />Definatey not one to buy folks. Sorry if my first comment is terribly negative but I could not find anything positive to say and I would like to think I may save someone else wasting their money like I have.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","posit","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","watch","i","can","not","sit","through","the","whole","thing","i","conjur","think","writer","must","have","some","weird","fetish","for","woman","pee","puke","and","crap","i","mean","what","be","that","all","about","i","cant","believ","thi","be","even","make","and","be","disgust","at","have","ingwast","a","rental","fee","the","qualiti","both","pictur","and","sound","be","terribl","the","act","good","doe","not","exist","it","be","a","poor","excus","for","a","film","and","the","scene","of","pee","crap","and","puke","be","reminisc","of","girl","cup","urghh","avoid","at","all","cost","the","girl","look","like","thei","have","be","pick","off","the","street","and","onli","get","the","part","co","thei","have","be","will","to","take","their","top","off","while","thi","girl","have","nice","bodi","it","certainli","do","not","make","up","for","the","fact","their","shriek","be","aw","unconvinc","and","a","pain","to","my","earsbr","br","thi","be","like","possibli","wrong","than","a","ammateur","school","product","without","ani","proper","direct","and","hei","there","be","no","ne","for","a","set","a","it","all","seem","to","revolv","around","a","car","br","br","definatei","not","on","to","bui","folk","sorri","if","my","comment","be","terribli","neg","but","i","can","not","find","anyth","posit","to","sai","and","i","would","like","to","think","i","mai","save","someon","els","wast","their","monei","like","i","have"],"filtered":["thi","film","posit","wrong","film","ever","watch","sit","whole","thing","conjur","think","writer","must","weird","fetish","woman","pee","puke","crap","mean","cant","believ","thi","even","make","disgust","ingwast","rental","fee","qualiti","pictur","sound","terribl","act","good","doe","exist","poor","excus","film","scene","pee","crap","puke","reminisc","girl","cup","urghh","avoid","cost","girl","look","like","thei","pick","street","onli","get","part","co","thei","take","top","thi","girl","nice","bodi","certainli","make","fact","shriek","aw","unconvinc","pain","earsbr","br","thi","like","possibli","wrong","ammateur","school","product","without","ani","proper","direct","hei","ne","set","seem","revolv","around","car","br","br","definatei","bui","folk","sorri","comment","terribli","neg","find","anyth","posit","sai","like","think","mai","save","someon","els","wast","monei","like"],"filtered2":["posit","wrong","ever","watch","sit","whole","thing","conjur","think","writer","must","weird","fetish","woman","pee","puke","crap","mean","cant","believ","even","make","disgust","ingwast","rental","fee","qualiti","pictur","sound","terribl","act","good","doe","exist","poor","excus","scene","pee","crap","puke","reminisc","girl","cup","urghh","avoid","cost","girl","look","like","pick","street","onli","get","part","co","take","top","girl","nice","bodi","certainli","make","fact","shriek","aw","unconvinc","pain","earsbr","like","possibli","wrong","ammateur","school","product","without","ani","proper","direct","hei","ne","set","seem","revolv","around","car","definatei","bui","folk","sorri","comment","terribli","neg","find","anyth","posit","like","think","mai","save","someon","els","wast","monei","like"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,7,11,12,16,18,19,21,25,27,29,31,35,38,39,44,46,61,70,84,88,89,91,97,98,102,104,109,110,111,125,126,138,139,141,146,166,178,189,190,196,244,262,280,284,287,296,311,313,319,335,347,364,376,389,437,446,459,509,528,558,617,625,664,837,963,974,1005,1147,1153,1398,1454,1504,1506,1620,2436,2511,2514,3101,3950,4632,4667,4953],"values":[2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,7,11,12,16,18,19,21,25,27,29,31,35,38,39,44,46,61,70,84,88,89,91,97,98,102,104,109,110,111,125,126,138,139,141,146,166,178,189,190,196,244,262,280,284,287,296,311,313,319,335,347,364,376,389,437,446,459,509,528,558,617,625,664,837,963,974,1005,1147,1153,1398,1454,1504,1506,1620,2436,2511,2514,3101,3950,4632,4667,4953],"values":[1.2399534312410465,2.5841531782306313,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.8818517047392527,2.094675786251684,6.6638083547706675,2.0317223413467334,1.9940046109572438,2.0105926690411424,2.0545557924622586,2.0881990796736947,2.087553710177271,2.0728240170322856,2.125691139326857,2.1290479736304078,2.1183455303375887,2.2242236634

{"value":"Let's face it, romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared with dramatic movies (just look at the Academy Award nominations each year). But still, the good ones are truly an art form. Look at \"When Harry Met Sally\", \"Sleepless In Seattle\", and classics like \"Roman Holiday\" and \"It Happened One Night\". I like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness.<br /><br />This movie attempts to construct something that resembles a romantic comedy. But no one believes the romance between the main characters, and there is nothing funny to make up for that major shortcoming. Modine is way past being a leading man - especially a romantic lead. I'm sure as Executive Producer, he had the means - but not the good sense - to cast himself. And Gershon...I see possibilities of some comedic talent, but she had no script and a poorly developed character. And whose idea was the English accent?

{"value":"There's a lot the matter with Helen and none of it's good. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play mothers of a pair of Leopold & Loeb like killers who move from the mid-west to Hollywood to escape their past. Reynolds, a starstruck Jean Harlow wannabe, opens a dance studio for children and Winters is her piano player. Soon Winters (as Helen) begins to crack up. It's all very slow going and although there are moments of real creepiness (nasty phone calls, a visit from wino Timothy Carey), the movie is devoid of any real horror. Nevertheless, it's still worthy entertainment. The acting divas are fine and the production values are terrific. A music score by David Raskin, cinematography by Lucien Ballard and Oscar-nominated costumes contribute mightily. With this, A PLACE IN THE SUN and LOLITA to her credit, does anyone do crazy as well as Winters? Directed by Curtis Harrington, a master at this type of not quite A-movie exploitation. In addition to Carey, the oddball supporting cast includes Dennis Weaver, Agnes Moorehead (as a very Aimee Semple McPherson like evangelist), Yvette Vickers and Micheál MacLiammóir (the Irish Orson

{"value":"Happy Go Lovely is a waste of everybody's time and talent including the audience. The lightness of the old-hat mistaken identity and faux scandal plot lines is eminently forgivable. Very few people watched these movies for their plots. But, they usually had some interesting minor characters involved in subplots -- not here. They usually had interesting choreography and breathtaking dancing and catchy songs. Not Happy Go Lovely. And Vera-Ellen as the female lead played the whole movie as a second banana looking desperately for a star to play off it -- and instead she was called upon to carry the movie, and couldn't do it. The Scottish locale was wasted. Usually automatically ubiquitous droll Scottish whimsy is absent. The photography was pedestrian. The musical numbers were pedestrian. Cesar Romero gives his usual professional performance, chewing up the scenery since no one else was doing his part, in the type of producer role essayed frequently by Walter Abel and Adolph Menjou. David Niven is just fine, and no one could do David Niven like David Niven. At the end of the day, if you adore Niven as I do, it's reason enough to waste 90 minutes on Happy Go Lovely.

{"value":"It's funny. I've seen a bunch of Fassbinder films and I have found some to be extremely creative and interesting, while others are repellent and self-indulgent messes--like this film. For me, it ranges from great to crap--without much in the middle. I know he has a lot of fans among the \"sophisticated\", but I can't help but think that a lot of his appeal is pure hype. From my point of view (and I know I will get a lot of negative ratings for this), he made too many movies too quickly and was too self-indulgent. His gay or gender-bending films (like this one) tend to be really bad--sloppily done, sometimes quite boring (such as QUERELLE and THE BITTER TEARS OF PETRA VON KANT) and sometimes just gross (like this film). Couldn't his message about acceptance of a person's gender-confusion be handled better than showing him get slapped around or watching cows being gruesomely slaughtered? Show some sensitivity for the subject matter and make your characters more human and sympathetic--then, maybe, I'd care about the films. <br /><br />I'm honestly at the point after watching this film that I might not bother with any more Fassbinder films--the bad seems to be out-weighing the good.","finished_norm":["it","funni","i","have","see","a","bunch","of","fassbind","film","and","i","have","find","some","to","be","extrem","creativ","and","interest","while","other","be","repel","and","selfindulg","messeslik","thi","film","for","me","it","rang","from","great","to","crapwithout","much","in","the","middl","i","know","he","have","a","lot","of","fan","among","the","sophist","but","i","ca","not","help","but","think","that","a","lot","of","hi","appeal","be","pure","hyp","from","my","point","of","view","and","i","know","i","will","get","a","lot","of","neg","rate","for","thi","he","make","too","mani","movi","too","quickli","and","be","too","selfindulg","hi","gai","or","genderbend","film","like","thi","on","tend","to","be","realli","badsloppili","do","sometim","quit","bore","such","a","querel","and","the","bitter","tear","of","petra","von","kant","and","sometim","just","gross","like","thi","film","can","not","hi","messag","about","accept","of","a","person","genderconfus","be","handl","well","than","show","him","get","slap","around","or","watch","cow","be","gruesom","slaughter","show","some","sensit","for","the","subject","matt","and","make","your","charact","much","human","and","sympatheticthen","mayb","i","have","care","about","the","film","br","br","i","be","honestli","at","the","point","after","watch","thi","film","that","i","mai","not","bother","with","ani","much","fassbind","filmsth","bad","seem","to","be","outweigh","the","good"],"filtered":["funni","see","bunch","fassbind","film","find","extrem","creativ","interest","repel","selfindulg","messeslik","thi","film","rang","great","crapwithout","much","middl","know","lot","fan","among","sophist","ca","help","think","lot","hi","appeal","pure","hyp","point","view","know","get","lot","neg","rate","thi","make","mani","movi","quickli","selfindulg","hi","gai","genderbend","film","like","thi","tend","realli","badsloppili","sometim","quit","bore","querel","bitter","tear","petra","von","kant","sometim","gross","like","thi","film","hi","messag","accept","person","genderconfus","handl","well","show","get","slap","around","watch","cow","gruesom","slaughter","show","sensit","subject","matt","make","charact","much","human","sympatheticthen","mayb","care","film","br","br","honestli","point","watch","thi","film","mai","bother","ani","much","fassbind","filmsth","bad","seem","outweigh","good"],"filtered2":["funni","see","bunch","fassbind","find","extrem","creativ","interest","repel","selfindulg","messeslik","rang","great","crapwithout","middl","know","lot","fan","among","sophist","ca","help","think","lot","appeal","pure","hyp","point","view","know","get","lot","neg","rate","make","mani","quickli","selfindulg","gai","genderbend","like","tend","realli","badsloppili","sometim","quit","bore","querel","bitter","tear","petra","von","kant","sometim","gross","like","messag","accept","person","genderconfus","handl","well","show","get","slap","around","watch","cow","gruesom","slaughter","show","sensit","subject","matt","make","charact","human","sympatheticthen","mayb","care","honestli","point","watch","mai","bother","ani","fassbind","filmsth","bad","seem","outweigh","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,10,12,13,20,26,27,28,35,38,46,50,51,60,62,66,72,81,98,108,120,140,153,163,185,202,205,292,312,329,408,419,496,500,550,554,569,640,689,725,742,757,771,826,945,1120,1128,1147,1491,1553,1600,1655,1709,2105,2304,2827,2886,3010,3067,3139,3766,4695,7270,7597],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,10,12,13,20,26,27,28,35,38,46,50,51,60,62,66,72,81,98,108,120,140,153,163,185,202,205,292,312,329,408,419,496,500,550,554,569,640,689,725,742,757,771,826,945,1120,1128,1147,1491,1553,1600,1655,1709,2105,2304,2827,2886,3010,3067,3139,3766,4695,7270,7597],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,2.6649848339420377,1.3002700588679295,3.0904588387038183,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.655771293751733,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,2.0226120445069267,3.859446346783224,5.762839126248157,1.949757232424728,2.0881990796736947,2.138507503627933,2.2044500422972613,2.317169775997098,2.3409902041158843,2.4000574358028657,2.518833027372001,2.597304642813496,2.571852579609833,2.9752256367457734,2.8824835850471584,2.951986790814132,3.130944944345658,3.1758963322079246,3.293679367864308,6.762949502332293,3.4751392270607813,3.439602492783994,3.6436037491933098,3.9998419165363233,3.634471265630037,3.6466665387238555,3.7165362186843414,3.7165362186843414,3.72645365534168

{"value":"\"People I Know\" is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about -- despite the game efforts of a talented cast.<br /><br />Pacino delivers his usual tour de force as Eli Wurman, a past-his-prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption. But unlike Michael Corleone, it's impossible to have an emotional investment in this character, his dilemma, or his fate.<br /><br />The film traces Eli's preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause, while distracted by a client's (Ryan O'Neal, good in an underwritten part) latest \"dirty laundry\" -- in this case, a TV actress companion who's gotten involved with the wrong people. Tea Leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role, although again, the script doesn't give her much to work with. As Eli's sister-in-law, Kim Basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics.<br /><br />This movie is strictly for those who like watching Pacino strut his stuff, and enjoy the other principals. Unfortunately, between the script and direction, \"People I Know\" is strictly amateurish. Hence its limited theatrical release, and speedy journey to DVD.

{"value":"First off, to give you some idea of my taste in movies...<br /><br />2007 Comedies I enjoyed: Superbad, Knocked Up, Hot Fuzz, Blades Of Glory <br /><br />2007 Comedies I hated: Evan Almighty, The Brothers Solomon, Good Luck Chuck<br /><br />I should have followed my first instinct and turned off \"Hot Rod\" after I got to about the 20 minute mark. I knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once. The script is absolutely brutal - I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack 6 on IMDb. Any one older than 10 years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental defective.<br /><br />This doesn't come close to anything with Will Farrell and it's clear that Andy Samberg can't carry anything longer than a 5 to 10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL. I don't know how they roped Ian McShane and Isla Fisher into doing this movie... they must have owed favors or something. I came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie, but I thought it would at least be funny. I didn't so much as smirk.<br /><br />I don't normally comment on movies at IMDb, but this was so awful, I just had to warn people. This is only the 4th movie I've seen that I've felt compelled to rate 1/10.","finished_norm":["off","to","give","you","some","idea","of","my","tast","in","moviesbr","br","comedi","i","enjoi","superbad","knock","up","hot","fuzz","blade","of","glori","br","br","comedi","i","hate","evan","almighti","the","brother","solomon","good","luck","chuckbr","br","i","should","have","follow","my","instinct","and","turn","off","hot","rod","after","i","get","to","about","the","minut","mark","i","know","by","that","point","that","thi","movi","would","not","make","me","laugh","onc","the","script","be","absolut","brutal","i","have","no","idea","how","thi","monstros","manag","to","crack","on","imdb","ani","on","old","than","year","old","who","enjoi","thi","must","be","some","kind","of","mental","defectivebr","br","thi","doe","not","come","close","to","anyth","with","will","farrel","and","it","clear","that","andi","samberg","ca","not","carri","anyth","long","than","a","to","minut","sketch","on","youtub","or","snl","i","do","not","know","how","thei","rope","ian","mcshane","and","isla","fisher","into","do","thi","movi","thei","must","have","ow","favor","or","someth","i","come","in","know","that","it","would","be","a","dumb","movi","but","i","think","it","would","at","littl","be","funni","i","do","not","so","much","a","smirkbr","br","i","do","not","normal","comment","on","movi","at","imdb","but","thi","be","so","aw","i","just","have","to","warn","peopl","thi","be","onli","the","th","movi","i","have","see","that","i","have","feel","compel","to","rate"],"filtered":["give","idea","tast","moviesbr","br","comedi","enjoi","superbad","knock","hot","fuzz","blade","glori","br","br","comedi","hate","evan","almighti","brother","solomon","good","luck","chuckbr","br","follow","instinct","turn","hot","rod","get","minut","mark","know","point","thi","movi","make","laugh","onc","script","absolut","brutal","idea","thi","monstros","manag","crack","imdb","ani","old","year","old","enjoi","thi","must","kind","mental","defectivebr","br","thi","doe","come","close","anyth","farrel","clear","andi","samberg","ca","carri","anyth","long","minut","sketch","youtub","snl","know","thei","rope","ian","mcshane","isla","fisher","thi","movi","thei","must","ow","favor","someth","come","know","dumb","movi","think","littl","funni","much","smirkbr","br","normal","comment","movi","imdb","thi","aw","warn","peopl","thi","onli","th","movi","see","feel","compel","rate"],"filtered2":["give","idea","tast","moviesbr","comedi","enjoi","superbad","knock","hot","fuzz","blade","glori","comedi","hate","evan","almighti","brother","solomon","good","luck","chuckbr","follow","instinct","turn","hot","rod","get","minut","mark","know","point","make","laugh","onc","script","absolut","brutal","idea","monstros","manag","crack","imdb","ani","old","year","old","enjoi","must","kind","mental","defectivebr","doe","come","close","anyth","farrel","clear","andi","samberg","ca","carri","anyth","long","minut","sketch","youtub","snl","know","rope","ian","mcshane","isla","fisher","must","ow","favor","someth","come","know","dumb","think","littl","funni","smirkbr","normal","comment","imdb","aw","warn","peopl","onli","th","see","feel","compel","rate"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,11,12,14,18,23,26,27,30,34,43,53,57,59,62,66,67,77,81,96,99,104,122,123,127,133,138,141,200,202,222,236,260,280,295,339,345,381,420,527,590,592,621,666,700,717,853,872,911,1115,1191,1254,1410,1648,1794,1926,2531,2620,2628,2673,2920,2949,3003,3098,3526,3591,3924,3940,4688,5263,6120,6818,7443],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,11,12,14,18,23,26,27,30,34,43,53,57,59,62,66,67,77,81,96,99,104,122,123,127,133,138,141,200,202,222,236,260,280,295,339,345,381,420,527,590,592,621,666,700,717,853,872,911,1115,1191,1254,1410,1648,1794,1926,2531,2620,2628,2673,2920,2949,3003,3098,3526,3591,3924,3940,4688,5263,6120,6818,7443],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.364847727375781,3.9974772509130565,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,2.7965700178917925,1.6608112036218214,1.7003182735607676,1.834162586674748,3.7386508898401445,2.0226120445069267,1.929723173391612,3.9141830778533158,1.9463902258768238,1.949757232424728,2.0390708128715254,2.056430207256609,4.145648034064571,2.2489347673732487,4.523814194644097,4.871935874217273,2.3212364753796515,2.2907365189289424,4.5315094715482385,5.061642365863941,2.597304642813496,2.5771019354959765,2.617923930016232,2.6754694156628323,2.8028805344481915,2.7910771187233068,3.003844442051426,3.0022328381570844,3.24941502915308,3.3023374306074227,3.439602492783994,3.4986697244709752,7.018616245352062,3.54

{"value":"I was disgusted by this movie. No it wasn't because of the graphic sex scenes, it was because it ruined the image of Artemisia Gentileschi. This movie does not hold much truth about her and her art. It shows one piece of art work that she did (Judith Beheading Holofernese) but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first Judith for a year after the trial.<br /><br />I don't know if you understood this from the movie, probably not, Tassi was not a noble character. He RAPED Artemisia. It was not love, it was rape. He did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured. According to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew Artemisia (aka had sex with) while she states over and over again \"It's true\".<br /><br />I encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real Artemisia and see what she is really about. Don't base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie.

{"value":"\"Private Practice\" is being spun off the fairly successful and well written \"Grey's Anatomy\". The cast is fabulous. The premise might even work. But the writing is just terrible.<br /><br />The pre-pilot disguised as a Grey's Anatomy episode should have been my first warning. The plot was just blah. I thought maybe it was a fluke. So I set the DVR to tape the pilot and all other episodes.<br /><br />As I was watching the pilot, I just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot. The pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more. There's supposed to be excitement, flash, great writing, intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. Amazingly, this show had none of that.<br /><br />Thinking it was a fluke, I just watched the second episode hoping for the best. And although marginally better, it doesn't come close to what it needs to be interesting can't miss TV.<br /><br />I just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch. Not worth the effort IMO, and I would be very surprised if this show even makes it through mid season.

{"value":"Pathetic. This is what happens when director comes to work just because someone is paying him to. <br /><br />The intentions were good, great locations and settings for a film of epic proportions. But the performance, damn! I swear, in some shots you can see extras on the background staring in the camera, or looking at the actors because no one told them what they should do when they hear \"Action!\". The battle scenes are so bad you wonder - are these people for real? They could've done more damage just by hugging each other. In the slow-mo scenes you can see people on battle field walking around or just standing, waving their hands. <br /><br />Only action in the foreground is somehow emphasized. But for what? The story is so illogical and discontinuous, it seems like random situations in chronological order, sometimes not even that. The dialogs are dumb, the love plot is more embarrassing and ridiculous than in Hong Kong action movies. <br /><br />With a budget of 40 million, and you can see every dollar invested on the screen,

{"value":"You know this is gonna be a cheesy movie when:<br /><br />1. It was made it the 50's 2. It's in black and white. 3. It has no name actors! 4. Screaming makes up for the lack of special effects!<br /><br />Well not to be outdone - this movie brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic blunder.<br /><br />Okay - shhhhh but I am gonna discuss special effects here - or lack of them - <br /><br />Did you catch the underwater scenes? It looks like it was poorly filmed through an aquarium - note the cape flapping in the breeze.<br /><br />And the repeated re-use of Stock Footage, (exterior house shots, the bridges scenes -- great enhanced the K-R-A-F-Tiness of this film - not since \"PLAN 9\" - have I seen such creative usage of stock footage.<br /><br />And hey where there was a lack of special effects - not to worry - screaming DOES take the place of special effects in this movie as well.

{"value":"One scene demonstrates the mentality of \"Terminator Woman\" pretty well: Karen Sheperd and another woman are trying to escape from the villain's camp. Karen runs across an armed guard, who points his gun at her, but after a few seconds throws it away and challenges her to a fight. Karen kicks him in the balls, picks up the gun and runs away! Then again, when a film is directed by a martial artist and written / produced by another member of his family, you know you shouldn't expect too much. Karen Sheperd and Jerry Trimble do get some amusing banter going early on, and the film might have turned out better if it had focused more on their love-hate relationship. But after about 20 minutes they get separated, and the film slows to a crawl, and even with the occasional fight scene to liven things up, it lacks excitement. The finale has Trimble fighting Qissi inside a cave and Sheperd going womano-a-womano against the beautiful Ashley Hayden on a speedboat, but the fights are intercut in a way that breaks their flow and diminishes their value.

{"value":"I saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie. The only thing I did see was Quentin Tarantino's seeming insane obsession for it... There were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality. Overall however, I found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous. The hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks I found clumsy and dizzying, even sickening. Overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the U.S. military against various malcontents.<br /><br />The various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and \"conclusions.\" A depressing movie (not a true _film_, a term I reserve for true art) that left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a \"romantic comedy\" though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content, form, and conclusion any

{"value":"OK, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give it a little credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the CIA director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world, is prescient. That's it. That's the good stuff. The acting...fair. The plot...silly. The \"twist\"... unnecessary. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated. Don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for \"plagues\" and how to contain them? Proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. It isn't to send them off to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, why was the plane door open and the \"shooters' standing there with no protection? In fact, did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs? That would stop her. But not as dramatic. I'm a sucker. I always watch a movie to see the end, once I started it. But this was a waste of time, and for the most part, predictable. I saw it using a recorder so I didn't have to watch all the ads, that was a plus. It's a good example of why I watch so little network TV.

{"value":"Maybe television will be as brutal one day. Maybe Big Brother` was only the first step in the direction Stephen Richard Bachmann` King described the end point of. But enough about that. If I spend too much words talking about the serious background topic of this movie I do exactly what the producers hoped by choosing this material. It's the same with The 6th Day`. No matter, how primitive the film is, it provokes a discussion about its topic, which serves the producers as publicity. Let's NOT be taken in by that. The social criticism that is suggested by that plot summary is only an alibi to make it possible to produce a speculative, violent movie, more for video sale than for cinema. <br /><br />I didn't read the book. I don't dare criticising Stephen King without having read him, but when I saw the film I thought they couldn't make such a terrible film out of a good book: In a typical 1980s set with 1980s music and some minor actors Arnold Schwarzenegger finds himself as a policeman running away from killers within a cruel TV show.

{"value":"I cannot believe that the Indian film industry still puts out such third-rate dross as Waqt. For starters, the storyline is totally implausible  spoilt son gets thrown out of family home so as to teach him some self-sufficiency. So what does he do? He promptly goes on to win some national talent contest by doing some star jumps in front of a panel of judges (I honestly am not joking here). In the meantime, his dad is dying of lung cancer, but keeps it a secret from the son, but he survives long enough to see his son become famous, to see his new grandson and also make a new toy giraffe with his own hands.<br /><br />The acting is cringe worthy in its hamminess  no effort was made to try and act in any convincing manner by any of the main players in this film. As usual for Indian films, the family lived in a huge mansion and seemed relatively untouched by the concerns of the real world.<br /><br />To be honest, the main losers when such dire films are made are the intelligent viewers who made the mistake of seeing such a film. The actors, such as Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, will still be revered as Gods by those people who have nothing but blind faith in

{"value":"Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is probably the worst film ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood(without the heart). The lightning is terrible. The music is very bad(piano and orgue... come on!). The acting is... well there is no acting!<br /><br />There's a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger.<br /><br />The killer is a fat, unscary clown who couldn't outrun a turtle!<br /><br />Every members of the cast is stupid and the director put every clichés of slashers movies in the film without effort.<br /><br />The end is so far the most stupid ever made. Think about it: The guy(ken hebert) who's acting skill is about the same as his writing(he's the brain behind this flop) invite a co-worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week-end and kills them...

{"value":"Yes, I was lucky enough to see the long-running original production of Michael Bennett's hit musical. It was an amazing experience and I paid to see the movie when it hit theatres back in 1985. It is awful. Almost everything fails. First off, Attenborough (a fine actor, a good director with the right material) is a sorry choice - almost as bad as when John Huston was hired to mangle ANNIE. The camera is always in the wrong place - they chop up the songs and the CASTING!!! They are awful - the power of the play was these dancers - these hungry, talented performers just wanted a chance to show what they could do and when they got their chance - you couldn't take your eyes off of them. But this cast just gets by dancing, does a \"nice\" job singing but none of them spark one bit. In fact, look up the cast on IMDb - none of them really went on to do anything much. (OK, OK, Janet Jones married Gretzky - sheesh). So this cinema trainwreck does not capture for one second the magic, the desperation, the passion of the stage musical. A total strike-out!

{"value":"It really was that bad. On a par with the (mercifully!) short-lived \"Dirty Dozen\" TV series that starred Ben Murphy and was made at around the same time (also on the cheap in Yugoslavia).<br /><br />I was embarrassed for the cast members of this film - and for Telly Savalas in particular. He was waaaaaay too old and fat for the role (pushing 70 when he made this garbage), and the reviewer who draws parallels with Telly the Greek in this and John Wayne in \"The Green Berets\" pretty much sums it up.<br /><br />Other reviewers have pointed out some of the many laughable howlers that this crime against celluloid contains, so I won't repeat them here. But I will add that I'm amazed that no-one's yet mentioned the ridiculously tiny-looking helmet that Savalas wears on his big, bloated head. <br /><br />I'm also astonished that this trainwreck of a film has a rating as high as 4.7 here at IMDb.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, it's a \"1\" right across the board.

{"value":"Spirit of a murdered high school geek animates a scarecrow which then takes revenge on everyone.<br /><br />This movie really annoyed me. It has a great looking monster, has some good low budget effects, some atmosphere but manages to short circuit the good stuff with bad. Half way in I started to fast forward and then step through the chapters on the DVD.<br /><br />The problems with this movie are many. First off the cast looks about thirty and yet they are suppose to be in high school. You don't believe anything from the get go as a result. The scarecrow, while looking great isn't much beyond that. He says stupid one liners and moves in a manner more designed to be funny then scary. Is this a comedy or a horror movie? Its a problem that goes beyond the one liners to much of the dialog and set up. It seems more send up of every cliché than heartfelt horror film. I some how expect that the film was made for a very narrow audience in mind, horror fans who want to mock the genre rather than embrace it.<br /><br />Despite the good looking monster this is a film to avoid.

{"value":"What a sad sight these TV stalwarts make, running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate. The whole production feels cheap and shabby, and it's not helped by a \"big name\" star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he's given in a credible fashion.<br /><br />At no time do the supporting cast rise above the material; they're clearly watching the clock here. Bang out the scenes, get the pay cheque, go home, and try to forget all about it.<br /><br />It's not particularly badly scripted or filmed; there are no real clangers, it's just utterly anodyne, and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras. The pacing is a little bizarre; an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub-plot is only begun after the main action starts, which makes it feel irrelevant.<br /><br />Maiden Voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored, and for being a fun game of \"spot the Kiwi bit parters\"; most of the cast are graduates of Shortland Street or Xena: Warrior Princess.

{"value":"I've never been impressed by JD anyway, and Final Justice (which I hadn't seen prior to its MST3k airing) proves to be no exception. It's not that the character is any less likeable than Mitchell: it's just that there's less that Geronimo (\"Call me 'Heronimo') to dislike.<br /><br />In fact, one suspects that Mitchell and Final Justice were all schemes of a revenge-seeking agent of Joe Don's trying to get the \"star\" killed by inducing a heart attack.<br /><br />Joe Don must have found a new agent, since he's now graduated to \"comic relief\" in James Bond movies. The problem is, it's hard to tell the difference between his comedy characters there, and his \"serious\" characters in his action-movies like this one.<br /><br />As for the plot...umm, what plot? They repeat the same set pieces so repeatedly you'll think you were watching Groundhog's Day 2. Presumably, the fact they keep using the same scene of Geronimo getting out of jail is supposed to be comic relief of some sort. Ummm, yeah, whatever.<br /><br />On the plus side, the Malta scenery is pretty gorgeous, so that kicked it up to a 2 for me.

{"value":"watch a team of bomb disposal experts in Iraq count down their time before they can go home.<br /><br />That in itself sounds boring. Every time that little caption came up telling us how long they had left, it just caused this film with no plot to drag on and on. hurry up and finish your time there so we can all go home.<br /><br />I must be missing something. I'm a great fan of war films if they are done well. This had \"jarhead\" syndrome. A film that at times was beautifully shot, but cinematography doesn't stop it from being totally dull and pointless.<br /><br />And get over the slow mo \"cartridges coming out of the gun\" shot already. they could have saved money and just got stock footage from any other film with a gun in it.<br /><br />I didn't have any empathy for the main guy in it, i was constantly hoping that his recklessness would cause him to die. In fact the film would have worked much better if he had.<br /><br />I read some reviews and seemed to get the feeling that those who had been in the armed forces disliked it, and everyone else loved it. I have never been in the forces, and I'm with them.

{"value":"I doubt Jigsaw was hip even at the time, the whole LSD theme married to a murder mystery being a patently obvious attempt to grab a young audience of the era without in the least truly showing any understanding of the sixties counterculture. The dated aspect aside, Jigsaw suffers from many problems, including overwrought acting, silly and stilted dialogue, LSD flashbacks that go on interminably long even after the point has been hammered home in the first 60 seconds, a failure to create any true suspense even though the actual plot is, on paper, a great vehicle to do just that, and an ending that is so trite and predictable (not to mention reminiscent of a lot of bad television shows) that the climax is actually an anti-climax. If it was a better movie, we might be able to suspend disbelief on a few things where it would help enjoyment, but the weaknesses are so glaring they only serve to highlight the improbabilities viewers might otherwise overlook. I saw Jigsaw on television and it is definitely late night TV fare meant to fill airspace and pass the time to kill somebody's insomnia rather than anything anybody ought to actively seek out.
