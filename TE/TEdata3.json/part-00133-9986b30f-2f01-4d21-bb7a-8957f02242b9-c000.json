{"value":"As there was nothing wrong with the acting etc etc the writing for the episode is way off for this series phantom or no phantom. It was a waste of 42 minutes to see the martian man hunter. You have to know that in the middle of the 6th series no matter what happens it is not true what is going on and really brings nothing to the story of the series except meeting the martian man hunter again and to waste 30 minutes to do this is by far another case of bad writing in the soap opera of smallville. I really like the show but mainly due to the cast and the 3 or so good episodes each year but who ever is on the writing cast that works or used to work on the soaps needs to be canned. This was by far one of the worst. With in the first 4 minutes you know that what is going on is bogus and anything happening is a dream based on Clark's infliction obviously caused by a phantom zone character and when he wakes up he will win and blah blah blah so the writers don't have to really create a villain that will progress the story line any this week. May as well have added another villain to die in the last episode the martian man hunter was in and made him fly away again or come back and tell Clark he forgot his sunglasses to get a closer look like in this episode and call it a day.","finished_norm":["a","there","be","noth","wrong","with","the","act","etc","etc","the","write","for","the","episod","be","wai","off","for","thi","seri","phantom","or","no","phantom","it","be","a","wast","of","minut","to","see","the","martian","man","hunter","you","have","to","know","that","in","the","middl","of","the","th","seri","no","matt","what","happen","it","be","not","true","what","be","go","on","and","realli","bring","noth","to","the","stori","of","the","seri","except","meet","the","martian","man","hunter","again","and","to","wast","minut","to","do","thi","be","by","far","anoth","case","of","bad","write","in","the","soap","opu","of","smallvil","i","realli","like","the","show","but","mainli","due","to","the","cast","and","the","or","so","good","episod","each","year","but","who","ever","be","on","the","write","cast","that","work","or","us","to","work","on","the","soap","ne","to","be","can","thi","be","by","far","on","of","the","wrong","with","in","the","minut","you","know","that","what","be","go","on","be","bogu","and","anyth","happen","be","a","dream","base","on","clark","inflict","obvious","caus","by","a","phantom","zone","charact","and","when","he","wake","up","he","will","win","and","blah","blah","blah","so","the","writer","do","not","have","to","realli","creat","a","villain","that","will","progress","the","stori","line","ani","thi","week","mai","a","good","have","add","anoth","villain","to","die","in","the","last","episod","the","martian","man","hunter","be","in","and","make","him","fly","awai","again","or","come","back","and","tell","clark","he","forget","hi","sunglass","to","get","a","close","look","like","in","thi","episod","and","call","it","a","dai"],"filtered":["noth","wrong","act","etc","etc","write","episod","wai","thi","seri","phantom","phantom","wast","minut","see","martian","man","hunter","know","middl","th","seri","matt","happen","true","go","realli","bring","noth","stori","seri","except","meet","martian","man","hunter","wast","minut","thi","far","anoth","case","bad","write","soap","opu","smallvil","realli","like","show","mainli","due","cast","good","episod","year","ever","write","cast","work","us","work","soap","ne","thi","far","wrong","minut","know","go","bogu","anyth","happen","dream","base","clark","inflict","obvious","caus","phantom","zone","charact","wake","win","blah","blah","blah","writer","realli","creat","villain","progress","stori","line","ani","thi","week","mai","good","add","anoth","villain","die","last","episod","martian","man","hunter","make","fly","awai","come","back","tell","clark","forget","hi","sunglass","get","close","look","like","thi","episod","call","dai"],"filtered2":["noth","wrong","act","etc","etc","write","wai","phantom","phantom","wast","minut","see","martian","man","hunter","know","middl","th","matt","happen","true","go","realli","bring","noth","stori","except","meet","martian","man","hunter","wast","minut","far","anoth","case","bad","write","soap","opu","smallvil","realli","like","show","mainli","due","cast","good","year","ever","write","cast","work","us","work","soap","ne","far","wrong","minut","know","go","bogu","anyth","happen","dream","base","clark","inflict","obvious","caus","phantom","zone","charact","wake","win","blah","blah","blah","writer","realli","creat","villain","progress","stori","line","ani","week","mai","good","add","anoth","villain","die","last","martian","man","hunter","make","fly","awai","come","back","tell","clark","forget","sunglass","get","close","look","like","call","dai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,9,10,13,16,17,21,25,26,27,28,33,34,44,45,46,48,49,56,57,59,63,65,73,89,90,92,94,101,104,107,110,132,142,144,155,233,250,287,288,293,295,299,304,334,341,350,362,373,408,429,453,489,520,554,568,607,652,853,857,1200,1211,1260,1343,1354,1375,1502,1773,2680,3631,3638,3764,5793,8462],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,9,10,13,16,17,21,25,26,27,28,33,34,44,45,46,48,49,56,57,59,63,65,73,89,90,92,94,101,104,107,110,132,142,144,155,233,250,287,288,293,295,299,304,334,341,350,362,373,408,429,453,489,520,554,568,607,652,853,857,1200,1211,1260,1343,1354,1375,1502,1773,2680,3631,3638,3764,5793,8462],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,3.3953824709201923,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,2.559277576165403,2.6649848339420377,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.604729392502474,5.44888831938665,1.655771293751733,3.3910232448024944,3.3840606616174704,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,5.6079

Masala film with loads of comedy, romance, action everything jumbled<br /><br />The ease at which the kids kidnap the family, is one of the funniest parts ever, Imagine kids kidnapping Dawood's family<br /><br />The end is a complete jumble mumble with sudden change of characterization<br /><br />RKS gives his weakest film till date, except some Bachchan scenes the film is a bore<br /><br />Music is boring<br /><br />Amitabh tries to give the role his all, he does his part well, though not his best though he contorts his face too much when pulling a trigger and does a weird look while

{"value":"If Ashanti had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery, still prevalent in third world countries the film might have been better received. Instead it turns into a star studded disaster of a movie where the stars came in, said their lines, and picked up their paychecks without much conviction.<br /><br />Michael Caine and his wife Beverly Johnson work for the United Nations World Health Organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in East Africa. Along comes Peter Ustinov who can barely summon enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a Moslem slave dealer. As Johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well.<br /><br />Of course Caine doesn't take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt. The rest of the cast has such folks as William Holden, Rex Harrison, Omar Sharif and Indian film star Kebir Bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing.<br /><br />Usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just overact outrageously and feast on a diet of scenery. But Ashanti doesn't even have that going for it.<br /><br />What an incredible waste of time.

{"value":"Despite the mysteriously positive reviews and high rating, this is an awful movie. Awful enough, that l feel obligated to warn you how bad it is. <br /><br />The movie is set in the final period of the Raj, during the time of India's fight for independence. What follows in the ridiculous plot just fills me with disbelief. What the characters do and how they behave just does not persuade me that the characters exist in that era. <br /><br />For instance, would the young married Hindu housemaid from the local village have an affair with her married Englishman Master, knowing full well that discovery of the affair would likely mean utter social ostracization and shame if not mortal punishment? Unlikely, but still maybe. However, would the same young Hindu housemaid, in the conservative society of India of that era carry on like a half naked Britney Spears in heat, partake in hot outdoor sex during daylight in open view where they might be discovered at any moment? That is not only bloody unlikely, that is a retarded plot line.<br /><br />Such idiocies combined with the poor acting, drove me to leave the cinema an hour into the movie, so i did not watch the second half of the movie. One could only hope the ending is of more intelligence than what i saw in the first half.","finished_norm":["despit","the","mysteri","posit","review","and","high","rate","thi","be","a","aw","movi","aw","enough","that","l","feel","oblig","to","warn","you","how","bad","it","be","br","br","the","movi","be","set","in","the","final","period","of","the","raj","dure","the","time","of","india","fight","for","independ","what","follow","in","the","ridicul","plot","just","fill","me","with","disbelief","what","the","charact","do","and","how","thei","behav","just","doe","not","persuad","me","that","the","charact","exist","in","that","era","br","br","for","instanc","would","the","young","marri","hindu","housemaid","from","the","local","villag","have","a","affair","with","her","marri","englishman","master","know","full","good","that","discoveri","of","the","affair","would","like","mean","utter","social","ostrac","and","shame","if","not","mortal","punish","unlik","but","still","mayb","howev","would","the","same","young","hindu","housemaid","in","the","conserv","societi","of","india","of","that","era","carri","on","like","a","half","nake","britnei","spear","in","heat","partak","in","hot","outdoor","sex","dure","daylight","in","open","view","where","thei","mai","be","discov","at","ani","moment","that","be","not","onli","bloodi","unlik","that","be","a","retard","plot","linebr","br","such","idioci","combin","with","the","poor","act","drive","me","to","leav","the","cinema","a","hour","into","the","movi","so","i","do","not","watch","the","half","of","the","movi","on","can","onli","hope","the","end","be","of","much","intellig","than","what","i","see","in","the","half"],"filtered":["despit","mysteri","posit","review","high","rate","thi","aw","movi","aw","enough","l","feel","oblig","warn","bad","br","br","movi","set","final","period","raj","dure","time","india","fight","independ","follow","ridicul","plot","fill","disbelief","charact","thei","behav","doe","persuad","charact","exist","era","br","br","instanc","young","marri","hindu","housemaid","local","villag","affair","marri","englishman","master","know","full","good","discoveri","affair","like","mean","utter","social","ostrac","shame","mortal","punish","unlik","still","mayb","howev","young","hindu","housemaid","conserv","societi","india","era","carri","like","half","nake","britnei","spear","heat","partak","hot","outdoor","sex","dure","daylight","open","view","thei","mai","discov","ani","moment","onli","bloodi","unlik","retard","plot","linebr","br","idioci","combin","poor","act","drive","leav","cinema","hour","movi","watch","half","movi","onli","hope","end","much","intellig","see","half"],"filtered2":["despit","mysteri","posit","review","high","rate","aw","aw","enough","l","feel","oblig","warn","bad","set","final","period","raj","dure","time","india","fight","independ","follow","ridicul","plot","fill","disbelief","charact","behav","doe","persuad","charact","exist","era","instanc","young","marri","hindu","housemaid","local","villag","affair","marri","englishman","master","know","full","good","discoveri","affair","like","mean","utter","social","ostrac","shame","mortal","punish","unlik","still","mayb","howev","young","hindu","housemaid","conserv","societi","india","era","carri","like","half","nake","britnei","spear","heat","partak","hot","outdoor","sex","dure","daylight","open","view","mai","discov","ani","moment","onli","bloodi","unlik","retard","plot","linebr","idioci","combin","poor","act","drive","leav","cinema","hour","watch","half","onli","hope","end","intellig","see","half"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,8,9,10,11,18,21,24,26,27,32,43,46,64,74,88,93,109,113,135,138,146,156,163,174,176,181,188,202,206,211,232,239,242,254,260,274,312,336,391,403,409,461,475,509,527,528,553,574,603,615,621,666,733,743,782,893,968,975,1024,1049,1059,1179,1201,1204,1210,1216,1574,1649,1689,1782,2140,2427,2879,2993,3375,3416,3577,3966,4414,4494,4608,4926,5368,5378,5535,5807,7778,8060],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,8,9,10,11,18,21,24,26,27,32,43,46,64,74,88,93,109,113,135,138,146,156,163,174,176,181,188,202,206,211,232,239,242,254,260,274,312,336,391,403,409,461,475,509,527,528,553,574,603,615,621,666,733,743,782,893,968,975,1024,1049,1059,1179,1201,1204,1210,1216,1574,1649,1689,1782,2140,2427,2879,2993,3375,3416,3577,3966,4414,4494,4608,4926,5368,5378,5535,5807,7778,8060],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,1.982619630677639,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,2.742262257014735,1.6608112036218214,1.6557

{"value":"Dark Wolf (Quick Review) Let's get right to it: This is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh*t on it. It's just an awful movie. It's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80's high school drama film. What's worse is that poor Kane Hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf. Kane f*cking Hodder. Someone's trying to ensure that playing Jason Voorhees is the height of his film career...<br /><br />Anyway, former Playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf, too. It's kind of a crappy cop drama with the world's worst looking werewolf in it. But it does have moments of near-rampant nudity. But that's about all. Want to know more? Okay, the werewolf is generally an ugly-looking black blur zipping around the screen. And when we're privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence, we're presented with something that resembles a full-motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the Playstation. The first Playstation. The CG animation is really that primitive. Only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit. 2/10<br /><br

{"value":"Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings, but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role. Leigh, playing bar-band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood, constantly leans on older sis Georgia, an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold. Perhaps due to her double duties as co-producer on the film, Leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner: she isn't credible as a singer and, even if this is intentional, gives herself far too much screen-time at the microphone. Probably hoping for a tour-de-force, Leigh is wire-drawn and nervous and jagged; however, we simply do not see any talent within this character (Leigh is obviously a solid actress, but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her). If Sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal, we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the (small) breaks that she does. As it is, the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim. Director Ulu Grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences, and the editing at the finale juxtaposes Sadie's bar performance with Georgia's sold-out arena show--both singing the same song--and it's a sadly nuanced moment...but really, what's the point? *1/2 from

{"value":"No, it's not the horror movie...This one is actually a love story.<br /><br />The Ring is a silent film from 1927 that stars two boxers and the woman that comes between them. She loves the boxer known as \"One Round\" Jack. She loves him until the champion comes along, that is. Even though she marries One Round, she starts overtly flirting with the champion until the climactic final boxing fight between One Round and the champion. She comes back to One Round's corner, just when things look their bleakest, and he miraculously finds the inner strength to win the fight and win his wife love back.<br /><br />This film was very early in Hitch's career, but the limitations of the time must not have made him make a lasting film. Although there are special film tricks, and some comedy relief, this film just does not hold up to any of his later work. It must have been extremely risqué for the time period though, with the shameless adulterous wife. That may have been the draw back in 1927. While looking through all of these old films, it is amazing how I think that they could be redone on today's screen and really come off.

{"value":"Gayniggers from Outer Space is pretty much summed up by its name. Running only 27 minutes long, it describes a spaceship of gay blacks that come to Earth to free the men from women. While I see a little significance to the plot, it also is really illogical. Granted, its meant to be a comedy/spoof on society and science fiction. I found myself laughing several times, so it succeeds there.<br /><br />The special effects are horrible. When the spaceship is floating above the Earth, you can see stars zoom by for no apparent reason. The asteroids shown in the beginning look fake, the equipment on the ship is illogical, there are several misspellings in the text, the actors are unconvincing, the characters are messed up; in general, the whole thing doesn't take itself seriously. If you get past all the aspects that make it a bad movie, its very accessible and easy to see through to the end. Some parts are hilarious. But overall, the only thing that you are left remembering is that it was one of the most ridiculous concepts ever.<br /><br />Seeing that its a short film and has some funny aspects, its not the worst thing to see. But its illogical and holds little long-term value.

{"value":"I read reviews on this movie and decided to give it a shot. I'm an open minded guy after all and I’ve given good reviews to some pretty bad flicks. As the end credits rolled on this one I searched for meaning and something nice to say. Here goes: \"This film was mercifully short.\" That's all I got.<br /><br />Okay, Okay. The sets and visuals were well done and the music helped lend to the mood of asylum life but the film was painful to watch and the endless dialogue took away from the good bits. I did find myself laughing at this film but the way you laugh at your best friend who just embarrassed himself in front of a large crowd.<br /><br />By the time of the \"chicken dance\" at the finale I had just decided to tuck and roll with the film and let the bodies fall where they fall. I don't know what could have salvaged this film. The acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget but there just wasn't any way to make it watchable; not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts. Maybe I should have sparked a doobie or drank a LOT of beer to get the full experience of the film. Either way, I'm not watching this film again unless I'm really depressed. Then I can tell myself “At least I wasn’t in ‘Dr. Tarr's Torture Dungeon.’ I’m better than those

{"value":"Apparently most viewer knows nothing about the history of Europe, including Germany, Hungary and the whole Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Hitler and Stalin Era. Nuremberg (and a lot of forgotten trials all over Europe) was a revenge and injustice of the winners. What do you think, why were not any American, British, French or Soviet defendants after the WWII? There were no American, British etc. war crimes? There were no Hiroshima, no Nagasaki, no Tokyo, no Dresden, no Hamburg, no Berlin, no Katyn and so on? The Germans had war crimes too, but in Nuremberg the justice was not a real consideration. The main point was: Vae victis! Germany must perish! (That was also a book title in America, 1941.)<br /><br />This film is an awful, ignoble American brainwashing instrument, full of error, lie, propaganda, prejudice and injustice. And first of all: full of hypocrisy. But not surprisingly... Why wasn't enough the Nuremberg process itself? This film is a nightmare. Total darkness after 60 years! This darkness (and hate and narcissism and lack of self-criticism) is the real cause of the massacres in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Serbia, Iraq and so forth.

{"value":"I like monster movies, generally. Even if they are implausible and silly. But its hard to like this movie when its so implausible and silly AND tries to take itself seriously all at the same time. Like in a really posh kind of way.<br /><br />While the idea is somewhat factual, like Orcas are known for killing Great White Sharks, its really hard to find it scary when I can't help but just see an angry Shamoo destroying stuff. Especially that one scene where some building exploded cause of the Orca's doing...and while it explodes, the thing jumps out of the water and it felt like I was watching a show at Sea World with fireworks. Plus they kill a lot of the scary moments before they even hint that they're going to happen. On top of that, it takes a few jabs at JAWS. Its like \"hey look, we're being factual and we can come up with BETTER reasons why the Orca is attacking\".<br /><br />Yes you are, ignoring your outrageous **** ups in logic of course. But JAWS had one thing your movie doesn't. Its scary. Yes its implausible. Yes its somewhat outrageous. But quite frankly, factual or not, a Killer Shark is not close to being as scary as a Great White. And the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts it more.

{"value":"For all its visual delights, how much better Renaissance would have been in live action. The animation is fantastic in the big picture, yes, but the characters are cold and hollow, much like the story and the style of this film. With real actors, perhaps the world of the film would not have felt so lifeless. There is much to admire here, but at the end I found that all I could do was admire. I did not enjoy the movie that much, and it clarifies something that I did not see before: that the visual elements can be the defining positive aspect of a film, but without a good story and strong characters, it can all be for nothing. I will not go so far as to say that this movie comes to nothing, but sometimes it comes dangerously close. I love Dark sci-fi thrillers. Blade Runner and Dark City are two films I thought were wonderful. But Blade Runner had its tragic villain and Dark City had its thought-provoking story arc. Renaissance has shadow and light, but little else. I wish I could have liked this movie more, but the weak story and the empty characters stood in the way of that. The Renaissance was a historical and artistic burst of color and life. How ironic, then, that one of the most bleak and lifeless movies I've seen this year takes its title from the

{"value":"I saw this recently and I must say, I was moved by the factual basis of the story. However, \"Holly\" as a movie did not quite work. I am however, looking forward to watching the documentary which the producers who organised this project had made because I think that would be a much more compelling work than this film.<br /><br />The international cast was composed of B-class actors but their acting was appropriate, and I must give a special mention for the young actress who played Holly. This was her first movie role and she did a very nice job, considering hers is the most challenging part. <br /><br />Ron Livingston was adequate but bland as Patrick, the American whose quest is to \"save\" Holly, but Chris Penn was good in this, his final role. Unfortunately, despite my mostly favourable opinion of Virginie Ledoyen and Udo Kier, both of these actors were very much forgettable and did not do their best work in this film.<br /><br />I believe in the film's message and intention, but I have to be fair, so I rate \"Holly\" 3 stars based on its shortcomings as a movie. But I think the subject matter deserves serious consideration and I am pleased that the people behind this movie have made a documentary as well which I hope will have its debut on BBC and other TV networks.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","recent","and","i","must","sai","i","be","move","by","the","factual","basi","of","the","stori","howev","holli","a","a","movi","do","not","quit","work","i","be","howev","look","forward","to","watch","the","documentari","which","the","produc","who","organis","thi","project","have","make","becaus","i","think","that","would","be","a","much","much","compel","work","than","thi","filmbr","br","the","intern","cast","be","compos","of","bclass","actor","but","their","act","be","appropri","and","i","must","give","a","special","mention","for","the","young","actress","who","plai","holli","thi","be","her","movi","role","and","she","do","a","veri","nice","job","consid","her","be","the","much","challeng","part","br","br","ron","livingston","be","adequ","but","bland","a","patrick","the","american","whose","quest","be","to","save","holli","but","chri","penn","be","good","in","thi","hi","final","role","unfortun","despit","my","mostli","favour","opinion","of","virgini","ledoyen","and","udo","kier","both","of","thi","actor","be","veri","much","forgett","and","do","not","do","their","well","work","in","thi","filmbr","br","i","believ","in","the","film","messag","and","intent","but","i","have","to","be","fair","so","i","rate","holli","star","base","on","it","shortcom","a","a","movi","but","i","think","the","subject","matt","deserv","seriou","consider","and","i","be","pleas","that","the","peopl","behind","thi","movi","have","make","a","documentari","a","good","which","i","hope","will","have","it","debut","on","bbc","and","other","tv","network"],"filtered":["see","thi","recent","must","sai","move","factual","basi","stori","howev","holli","movi","quit","work","howev","look","forward","watch","documentari","produc","organis","thi","project","make","becaus","think","much","much","compel","work","thi","filmbr","br","intern","cast","compos","bclass","actor","act","appropri","must","give","special","mention","young","actress","plai","holli","thi","movi","role","veri","nice","job","consid","much","challeng","part","br","br","ron","livingston","adequ","bland","patrick","american","whose","quest","save","holli","chri","penn","good","thi","hi","final","role","unfortun","despit","mostli","favour","opinion","virgini","ledoyen","udo","kier","thi","actor","veri","much","forgett","well","work","thi","filmbr","br","believ","film","messag","intent","fair","rate","holli","star","base","shortcom","movi","think","subject","matt","deserv","seriou","consider","pleas","peopl","behind","thi","movi","make","documentari","good","hope","debut","bbc","tv","network"],"filtered2":["see","recent","must","move","factual","basi","stori","howev","holli","quit","work","howev","look","forward","watch","documentari","produc","organis","project","make","becaus","think","compel","work","filmbr","intern","cast","compos","bclass","actor","act","appropri","must","give","special","mention","young","actress","plai","holli","role","veri","nice","job","consid","challeng","part","ron","livingston","adequ","bland","patrick","american","whose","quest","save","holli","chri","penn","good","final","role","unfortun","despit","mostli","favour","opinion","virgini","ledoyen","udo","kier","actor","veri","forgett","well","work","filmbr","believ","messag","intent","fair","rate","holli","star","base","shortcom","think","subject","matt","deserv","seriou","consider","pleas","peopl","behind","make","documentari","good","hope","debut","bbc","tv","network"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,12,15,16,17,20,21,22,23,30,40,41,48,61,91,92,100,113,120,128,135,141,156,172,181,189,202,203,223,227,261,262,275,285,289,317,334,346,354,391,393,408,423,493,510,538,550,562,566,569,598,624,660,699,811,877,1028,1140,1254,1382,1391,1463,1750,1792,1859,1943,1981,2034,2212,2255,2406,2410,2505,2518,3679,4258,5090,5391,5892,6615],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,12,15,16,17,20,21,22,23,30,40,41,48,61,91,92,100,113,120,128,135,141,156,172,181,189,202,203,223,227,261,262,275,285,289,317,334,346,354,391,393,408,423,493,510,538,550,562,566,569,598,624,660,699,811,877,1028,1140,1254,1382,1391,1463,1750,1792,1859,1943,1981,2034,2212,2255,2406,2410,2505,2518,3679,4258,5090,5391,5892,6615],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,2.133457220525776,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3364419891718522,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,5.086534867203742,1.8818517047392527,2.0105926690411424,2.0489535369135887,2.1405462403177813,4.3043565130405606,2.2044500422972613,

{"value":"This cowardly and offensive film had me intrigued to begin with. The characters are the familiar dispossessed young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a sea side town. Robert is an outsider but he has his music which could have been his soul. Instead Clay makes Robert into a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in \"reefer madness\" and Robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist. One wonders how much experience of real life this young director has. No one can save poor Robert. Clay leaves us with the message that young British men are out of control. A very unsubtle link is made to the Iraqi insurgents; during the needlessly graphic rape we are subjected to explosions and images of war. The film shows male peer group extremism pushed to it's limits. The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's hateful depiction of modern male. Clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves from inflicting terrible acts of violence. It is a wonder the British film industry allows money to be invested in films which advocate such divisive propaganda, when in London we are still reeling from the recent attacks.

{"value":"I rated this movie a 1 since the plot is so unbelievable unbelievable. Judge for yourself. Be warned, the following will not only give away the plot, but will also spoil your appetite for watching the movie.<br /><br />A computer virus, designed by a frustrated nerd, sends out a code through television screens and computer monitors. When the code - in the form of light - enters the eye it can access the 'electrical system' of your body. What it does is forcing the body cells into excretion of calcium. Within seconds after infection the patient reaches for his neck, develops tunnel vision, his skin will turn white of the calcium, after which he falls and his hand and scull will crack in a cloud of chalk. <br /><br />This virus is very intelligent. When it finds out that a blind computer expert is trying to disassemble the code with a braille output device - operated by hands - the device is set on a very high voltage, which causes severe burning wounds on the skin of the expert's head.

{"value":"A horribly pointless and, worse, boring film. Stranger Than Fiction has nothing new to say about anything, no characters beyond the most unimaginative stereotypes, and relies on a clunky central concept that is neither particularly original nor dealt with in a vaguely innovative way. <br /><br />Will Ferrell is totally wasted in what he presumably hoped to be his answer to Jim Carey's Truman Show, and substitutes his usual shouting routine (admittedly very funny if you discount Talledega Nights) for, well, pretty much nothing. <br /><br />Emma Thompson is no more than mildly irritating (that some reviews I've read here are talking her up for an Oscar nomination is laughable) whilst Maggie Gyllenhaal does a passable job with a very weak script that allows nothing beyond establishing her character as a former law student who dropped out of Harvard to become a baker because she liked making people happy. Please. That she ended up falling for Ferrell's 'character' is utterly ludicrous.<br /><br />Marc Forster's attempts to jazz up the film using computer graphics only serve to highlight the uninspired the material he has to work with.<br /><br />I had the choice of either going to watch The Prestige for the third time or seeing this. I wish I'd opted for The Prestige.","finished_norm":["a","horribli","pointless","and","wrong","bore","film","strang","than","fiction","have","noth","new","to","sai","about","anyth","no","charact","beyond","the","much","unimagin","stereotyp","and","reli","on","a","clunki","central","concept","that","be","neither","particularli","origin","nor","deal","with","in","a","vagu","innov","wai","br","br","will","ferrel","be","total","wast","in","what","he","presum","hope","to","be","hi","answer","to","jim","carei","truman","show","and","substitut","hi","usual","shout","routin","admittedli","veri","funni","if","you","discount","talledega","night","for","good","pretti","much","noth","br","br","emma","thompson","be","no","much","than","mildli","irrit","that","some","review","i","have","read","here","be","talk","her","up","for","a","oscar","nomin","be","laughabl","whilst","maggi","gyllenha","doe","a","passabl","job","with","a","veri","weak","script","that","allow","noth","beyond","establish","her","charact","a","a","former","law","student","who","drop","out","of","harvard","to","becom","a","baker","becaus","she","like","make","peopl","happi","pleas","that","she","end","up","fall","for","ferrel","charact","be","utterli","ludicrousbr","br","marc","forster","attempt","to","jazz","up","the","film","us","comput","graphic","onli","serv","to","highlight","the","uninspir","the","materi","he","have","to","work","withbr","br","i","have","the","choic","of","either","go","to","watch","the","prestig","for","the","time","or","see","thi","i","wish","i","have","opt","for","the","prestig"],"filtered":["horribli","pointless","wrong","bore","film","strang","fiction","noth","new","sai","anyth","charact","beyond","much","unimagin","stereotyp","reli","clunki","central","concept","neither","particularli","origin","deal","vagu","innov","wai","br","br","ferrel","total","wast","presum","hope","hi","answer","jim","carei","truman","show","substitut","hi","usual","shout","routin","admittedli","veri","funni","discount","talledega","night","good","pretti","much","noth","br","br","emma","thompson","much","mildli","irrit","review","read","talk","oscar","nomin","laughabl","whilst","maggi","gyllenha","doe","passabl","job","veri","weak","script","allow","noth","beyond","establish","charact","former","law","student","drop","harvard","becom","baker","becaus","like","make","peopl","happi","pleas","end","fall","ferrel","charact","utterli","ludicrousbr","br","marc","forster","attempt","jazz","film","us","comput","graphic","onli","serv","highlight","uninspir","materi","work","withbr","br","choic","either","go","watch","prestig","time","see","thi","wish","opt","prestig"],"filtered2":["horribli","pointless","wrong","bore","strang","fiction","noth","new","anyth","charact","beyond","unimagin","stereotyp","reli","clunki","central","concept","neither","particularli","origin","deal","vagu","innov","wai","ferrel","total","wast","presum","hope","answer","jim","carei","truman","show","substitut","usual","shout","routin","admittedli","veri","funni","discount","talledega","night","good","pretti","noth","emma","thompson","mildli","irrit","review","read","talk","oscar","nomin","laughabl","whilst","maggi","gyllenha","doe","passabl","job","veri","weak","script","allow","noth","beyond","establish","charact","former","law","student","drop","harvard","becom","baker","becaus","like","make","peopl","happi","pleas","end","fall","ferrel","charact","utterli","ludicrousbr","marc","forster","attempt","jazz","us","comput","graphic","onli","serv","highlight","uninspir","materi","work","withbr","choic","either","go","watch","prestig","time","see","wish","opt","prestig"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,8,10,11,15,18,22,23,24,25,28,33,48,49,56,62,69,77,78,87,89,104,108,115,145,170,176,177,181,184,186,207,210,265,289,346,379,399,417,468,497,502,521,534,537,552,604,605,626,718,726,765,800,808,815,816,904,916,959,979,1029,1040,1146,1263,1277,1358,1385,1428,1507,1524,1533,1549,1560,1573,1607,1795,1969,2426,2554,2634,2729,3063,3222,3233,3367,3746,3804,3897,4036,4337,4573,5946,6058,8530],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,8,10,11,15,18,22,23,24,25,28,33,48,49,56,62,69,77,78,87,89,104,108,115,145,170,176,177,181,184,186,207,210,265,289,346,379,399,417,468,497,502,521,534,537,552,604,605,626,718,726,765,800,808,815,816,904,916,959,979,1029,1040,1146,1263,1277,1358,1385,1428,1507,1524,1533,1549,1560,1573,1607,1795,1969,2426,2554,2634,2729,3063,3222,3233,3367,3746,3804,3897,4036,4337,4573,5946,6058,8530],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144

{"value":"Recap: Ron is about to marry Mel. They are deeply and love and certain they are perfect for each other even though they met just a few months ago. Todd, Ron's brother in law to be is not so happy. He is afraid the marriage is a threat to his cushy job in the family business and decides to arrange Ron's bachelor party. But his real plan is to put Ron in a compromising situation, get evidence and break Ron and Mel up.<br /><br />Comments: Supposed to be a sequel to a comedy classic but it isn't funny at all. It is mostly a pubertal show and a juvenile excuse to show scantily clad women. Actually, in a way, it is almost impressive have many you can put in there, because they are everywhere. Unfortunately that is also one of the signs of a movie that can't support itself. It simply isn't good enough.<br /><br />It has three redeeming points though, or actually three actors that is worth a better script than this. It is lead actor Josh Cooke who actually manages to give an impression of some common sense. Sara Foster I know has more talent than to do movies like this, and Emanuelle Vaugier seem to have a lot more talent than this movie.<br /><br />What is suspiciously absent are good jokes.

{"value":"I wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie \"Bachelor Party\", starring Tom Hanks. Is this movie even an official sequel? This movie is lacking in every department and you're obviously better off not watching it.<br /><br />For a comedy this movie simply isn't good or funny enough. It relies mostly on the character's their stereotypical assessments, rather then the movie actually features some good, original and funny moments.<br /><br />Of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages. You just keep waiting for things to finally start off. There is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it's something non-existent. I guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out.<br /><br />It's basically a typical teenage comedy, with lots of sex jokes and nudity, only without the teenage main characters, which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless. The movie makes some really wrong jokes, that are misplaced for any type of movie.<br /><br />I regret ever watching this.<br /><br

{"value":"I loved the Batman tv series and was really looking forward to this. But they tried to do too much.<br /><br />Why they had the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me. I don't want to knock Burt or Adam for the way they look now.....It's been 35 years since they appeared at Batman and Robin, but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting 'badguys' was kinda sad. I would rather of just seen the ex-stars do commentary. The batmobile side story was stupid.<br /><br />As for the flashback movie, I think it was too short and left out way too much. It was really just a quick overview in my opinion. I'd like more background. They showed the Penguin and Joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff I already knew. The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex-smoker. That was it on those 2.<br /><br />I'd love to read the book. I am sure it has more in it that this showed. Like why was there 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freezes.

{"value":"First, let me state that I am a big fan of Ashley Judd; that's why I was curious to check out this, her debut role. No argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent. I guess I can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. However, I like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails.<br /><br />By the halfway point, I found myself thinking, \"How much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl, idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise?\" It seemed to go on forever!<br /><br />Then, I thought, maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event. No such luck. The movie continues it's bland, boring, uneventful story all the way to the end.<br /><br />I'm not saying this because I'm an action-junkie. I like all kinds of movies, especially romantic-comedies. But I expect to be entertained.<br /><br />Add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home movies. Depressing!<br /><br />I just don't get how anyone could like this movie. Zero-entertainment value.

{"value":"As has been noted, this formula has been filmed several times, most recently as \"You've Got Mail\", with Tom Hanks and Meg\"Trout Pout\" Ryan. Of the several versions, this is my least favorite. The problem i think is that the studio coasted on the Stars charisma, which doesn't quite cut it here.<br /><br />The chemistry betwixt the two leads never comes to a boil in this movie. There are no real sparks. Van Johnson and Judy Garland remind me of day old donuts, pleasant but bland. And when the leads are boring the rest of the movie can only follow. Judy in particular is disappointing. She looks like she has no neck! I don't know if she was having trouble with pain or something but she looks like a turtle trying to pull it's head into it's shell, all hunched up and everything. I couldn't figure out what Van Johnson was getting so hot about. I would have made a bee line for that cute violin player. And Van wasn't great either. I've always thought of him as a rather generic Hollywood leading man and he doesn't do anything to dispel that image here.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the stars or the early 1900's then you might like this movie. But there are a lot more entertaining romantic comedies out there, and they offer you much more than a mouthful of stale

{"value":"Hanna-Barbera sucks the life out of another famous property. The violence is watered down, the stories are formulaic, the animation is bad, the music is obnoxious and repetitive, and frankly, the show just isn't funny.<br /><br />At the time, H-B put every one of its series through the same clichéd situations, regardless if it fit the world of the cartoon or not. Thus, Popeye and Bluto appear in a recurring segment as cavemen (\"Hey! Popeye is popular, and the Flinstones are popular. Put 'em together, and you can't miss!\"). Also, in an apparent ripoff of \"Private Benjamin,\" Olive Oyl and the Goon have a regular segment that features them as new army recruits. Seriously! Why? <br /><br />Adding to the annoyance factor are the public service announcements in every episode (standard practice at the time for cartoons, but still annoying). Popeye lectures his nephews on crossing the street safely, recycling, and - are you ready for this? - the dangers of smoking! (I swear I'm not making that up.)<br /><br />The only charm remaining from the original cartoons is that Jack Mercer, the voice of Popeye from the early days, continues the role here.<br /><br />Worth checking out once just to get a new appreciation for the old Fleischer shorts.

{"value":"I usually read reviews before I watch a movie. Guess what, I didn't do that before watching TLB, and I have to say I was very surprised to see the above average rating at IMDb. I found it to have a total lack of story. You just get dropped into it (and, sadly, not in the way Saving Private Ryan dropped us into the movie), and it also has a sudden end, which was very unsatisfying for me.<br /><br />I have to admit, the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me, especially with the low budget in mind. But prepare yourself to have a laugh... Some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are Olympic gymnasts. A mid-air corkscrew or somersault during WW I is a bit too much for me, especially when it's performed countless times during the movie...<br /><br />But the parts that really got me laughing until I almost cried were the scenes containing close combat. The screaming and shouting German voices...unbelievably funny. It seems as if they are spoken by one single actor / voice performer, because they all sound exactly the same, and it just sounds like a 'typical' German voice.<br /><br />I would absolutely NOT recommend this movie to anyone, except to people who just want to have some laughs because of the sad and corny quality of it.","finished_norm":["i","usual","read","review","befor","i","watch","a","movi","guess","what","i","do","not","do","that","befor","watch","tlb","and","i","have","to","sai","i","be","veri","surpris","to","see","the","abov","averag","rate","at","imdb","i","find","it","to","have","a","total","lack","of","stori","you","just","get","drop","into","it","and","sadli","not","in","the","wai","save","privat","ryan","drop","u","into","the","movi","and","it","conjur","have","a","sudden","end","which","be","veri","unsatisfi","for","mebr","br","i","have","to","admit","the","wound","soldier","look","pretti","realist","to","me","especi","with","the","low","budget","in","mind","but","prepar","yourself","to","have","a","laugh","some","gui","be","be","toss","through","the","air","after","a","explos","a","if","thei","be","olymp","gymnast","a","midair","corkscrew","or","somersault","dure","ww","i","be","a","bite","too","much","for","me","especi","when","it","perform","countless","time","dure","the","moviebr","br","but","the","part","that","realli","get","me","laugh","until","i","almost","cry","be","the","scene","contain","close","combat","the","scream","and","shout","german","voicesunbeliev","funni","it","seem","a","if","thei","be","speak","by","on","singl","actor","voic","perform","becaus","thei","all","sound","exactli","the","same","and","it","just","sound","like","a","typic","german","voicebr","br","i","would","absolut","not","recommend","thi","movi","to","anyon","except","to","peopl","who","just","want","to","have","some","laugh","becaus","of","the","sad","and","corni","qualiti","of","it"],"filtered":["usual","read","review","befor","watch","movi","guess","befor","watch","tlb","sai","veri","surpris","see","abov","averag","rate","imdb","find","total","lack","stori","get","drop","sadli","wai","save","privat","ryan","drop","u","movi","conjur","sudden","end","veri","unsatisfi","mebr","br","admit","wound","soldier","look","pretti","realist","especi","low","budget","mind","prepar","laugh","gui","toss","air","explos","thei","olymp","gymnast","midair","corkscrew","somersault","dure","ww","bite","much","especi","perform","countless","time","dure","moviebr","br","part","realli","get","laugh","almost","cry","scene","contain","close","combat","scream","shout","german","voicesunbeliev","funni","seem","thei","speak","singl","actor","voic","perform","becaus","thei","sound","exactli","sound","like","typic","german","voicebr","br","absolut","recommend","thi","movi","anyon","except","peopl","want","laugh","becaus","sad","corni","qualiti"],"filtered2":["usual","read","review","befor","watch","guess","befor","watch","tlb","veri","surpris","see","abov","averag","rate","imdb","find","total","lack","stori","get","drop","sadli","wai","save","privat","ryan","drop","u","conjur","sudden","end","veri","unsatisfi","mebr","admit","wound","soldier","look","pretti","realist","especi","low","budget","mind","prepar","laugh","gui","toss","air","explos","olymp","gymnast","midair","corkscrew","somersault","dure","ww","bite","especi","perform","countless","time","dure","moviebr","part","realli","get","laugh","almost","cry","scene","contain","close","combat","scream","shout","german","voicesunbeliev","funni","seem","speak","singl","actor","voic","perform","becaus","sound","exactli","sound","like","typic","german","voicebr","absolut","recommend","anyon","except","peopl","want","laugh","becaus","sad","corni","qualiti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,7,8,13,15,16,17,19,22,23,24,33,35,37,38,39,41,55,61,62,78,79,105,112,131,133,145,154,158,176,178,183,184,189,202,217,222,233,238,239,243,256,265,267,295,298,319,326,344,428,443,455,462,465,526,592,613,643,657,679,691,704,705,711,856,904,925,958,1295,1486,1616,1690,1696,1786,1969,2199,2232,2516,2527,2974,3111,4053,4261,6051],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,7,8,13,15,16,17,19,22,23,24,33,35,37,38,39,41,55,61,62,78,79,105,112,131,133,145,154,158,176,178,183,184,189,202,217,222,233,238,239,243,256,265,267,295,298,319,326,344,428,443,455,462,465,526,592,613,643,657,679,691,704,705,711,856,904,925,958,1295,1486,1616,1690,1696,1786,1969,2199,2232,2516,2527,2974,3111,4053,4261,6051],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.1317941569733974,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,2.5958480334723544,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.9536997889255368,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,3.893901213901217,4.3

{"value":"From a poorly contrived plot line that makes almost no sense to bad dialogue and disjointed scenes to the ultimate downer, bad acting (even Peter Falk can't find his way) \"Finding John Christmas\" is better left lost. Ms. Bertinelli's performance is without depth or emotion as are her co-stars, William Russ as brother Hank and David Cubitt as love interest Noah. Jennifer Pisana as Soccoro, the daughter of single dad Noah is almost unbearable to watch let alone listen to singing. But who can blame them with material like this. Michael J. Murray's script is juvenile at best. <br /><br />Each year at this time I search the TV guides and wait anxiously for some of the really classic Christmas and inspirational holiday films to appear on the small screen. Films like \"Miracle on 34th Street\", Ernst Lubitsch's delightful \"The shop around the corner\" and, of course the 1951 version of \"Scrooge\". There's Frank Capra's classics \"It's a wonderful life\" and \"Meet John Doe\". Hey, forget the classics. What about \"Home Alone\" or \" Home for the Holidays\" with Holly Hunter and a great performance by Robert Downey Jr.? <br /><br />My present to you is by way of advice. Your time would be better spent searching out these films than finding \"Finding John Christmas\".

{"value":"My first question after seeing this film was, \"Why is the title LIAM?\" If the intent was to tell a story from the boy's perspective, it was not carried out well. Of course there was the formulaic use of camera angles in the boy's scenes, but much of the crucial action took place outside of his field of view. Having a \"main\" character unable to speak (obviously suggesting the mute, powerless position of a child) makes it difficult to give that character much depth.<br /><br />Melodrama is defined as: \"dramatic or other literary work characterized by the use of stereotyped characters, exaggerated emotions and language, simplistic morality, and conflict\" LIAM fits this definition to a T. The viewer is hit over the head with the typical stereotypes of the fire and brimstone Catholic Church in the stern school marm and the well-fed priest squeezing money from parishioners. (A stereotype which is becoming very tiresome.) What's more--the Jewish characters are money lenders and factory owners!<br /><br />Much of the film was predictable...Who didn't think that we'd see Theresa scrubbing the toilet after her mother had told her \"No daughter of mine will scrub another woman's toilet!\" I'm a fan of British realism if it's done well.

{"value":"College student Alex Gardner (Nicholas Celozzi) is plagued by nightmares of a cellar-dwelling ghoul at Alcatraz. He dreams of cutting off his own hand, spitting up a worm, a ghoul ripping open his chest and being roasted over an open fire. After his friends see him levitating \"6 feet\" over his bed, a helpful, occult-obsessed teacher (Donna Denton) suggests that they sneak into Alcatraz to face his fears. Of course they go in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when things get out of hand!<br /><br />The group become stranded, Alex's brother Richard (Tom Reilly) becomes possessed and starts killing everyone. Toni Basil of \"Mickey\" fame shows up as the helpful ghost of Sammy Mitchell, lead singer of the group \"Bodybag\". She teaches Alex how to levitate out of his body and does a rock music dance intercut with repeat nightmare footage to pad out the running time. All of the victims show up as wisecracking ghosts a la the Griffin Dunne character in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON. The script is full of plot holes, cheesy dialogue and lame attempts at comedy. Good FX work and cool opening credits (both by Ernest D. Farino) are the only things gaining any merit.

{"value":"OK..this movie could have been soooo good! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had some of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie. The craft themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was, simply, fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracey being, was solid enough...but then the adults were taken out of the equation and we were asked to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines.<br /><br />It's not so much the fact that the movie was centred around the children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was slapping me with a wet fish and laughing at my hard earned money spent on the film, it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so obnoxious in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers...who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case.<br /><br />The film didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical. It tried to pay homage whilst satirising and it just generally fell flat on its face. 3/10 (2 for the machines, 1 for Lady

{"value":"The film was written 10 years back and a different director was planning it with SRK and Aamir in lead roles<br /><br />The film finally was made now with Vipul Shah directing it And Ajay and Salman starring together after a decade HUM DIL DE CHUKE SANAM(1999)<br /><br />The movie however falls short due to it's 90's handling and worst it's loopholes<br /><br />The film tries to pack in too many commercial ingredients and we also hav the love triangle<br /><br />Everything is predictable and filmy and too clichéd<br /><br />There are loopholes like how Ajay runs away from London Airport and makes a place for himself with no one? even the way he starts his band is not convincing The second half gets better with the twist in the tale of Ajay destroying Salman but sadly the climax falls short and the film ends on a bad note<br /><br />Direction by Vipul Shah is ordinary to below average Music is the worst point, most songs are mediocre<br /><br />Amongst actors Ajay gives his best shot though he isn't convincing as a Rock singer yet he does superb as the negative role Salman however irritates with his punjabi and talking nonsense he only impresses when he gets

{"value":"First of all, let me say the I am LDS or rather, I am a Mormon. So when I watched this film, I automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt. I can usually find something redeeming in every movie I watch. And this one was no exception. It does have its redeeming moments. But they are few and far between.<br /><br />One of the first things I noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though Halestorm was ashamed of our Church! In the LDS Church, congregations are called \"wards\" and the basketball court is in the \"cultural hall\". NEVER ONCE are either of these two names mentioned. The Church is never referred to by name and \"the standards\" is as far as it goes in mentioning what our Church believes.<br /><br />It makes me wonder if the directors are really LDS or LDS wannabes? This film had so much potential! It could have really shown our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer, but also what we believe. Instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired.

{"value":"Oh dear. This movie could have been sub-titled \"When writers go on strike!\" What a stinker. I had really high hopes for this, mostly after reading IMDb reviews, which makes me wonder about the whole IMDb rating system, but that's a separate matter. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchorman, Bruce Almighty, The Office, etc so I was expecting great things. To say I was disappointed is the understatement of the year. There are so many things wrong with this movie, but I'll confine myself to (a) the implausibility of ANY family behaving like these people do (A mass aerobics workout? What planet is THAT real life on?), the clunky script (a murderer of love? Please), and the fact that the character of Dan is so unlikable, you find yourself wondering what the girl saw in him to make her fall in love with him? This movie was filled to bursting with clunky dialogue, creaking direction, ridiculous set-scenes and it was slow, slow, slow. We would have walked out after half an hour if we'd not been with my parents, who don't get out much and don't like to waste money. Unlike the makers of this movie, who would have been better off throwing all the cash spent making this movie into a bonfire - that would have been more entertaining.

{"value":"Right away, this film was ridiculous. Not that it didn't have redeeming aspects For example, the best thing about this film was the beautiful background scenery. Anyone not living on the East Coast should know the South doesn't have beautiful mountains like those found in the West. I knew it was Utah right off the bat, but perhaps Dalton couldn't suppress his English accent, so they had to excuse it by saying this was a southern town. Subverting his accent into a Southern one was easier. Sure the film has plot twists, but its phony sense of place was something I couldn't get past. It's not like Utah doesn't have meth labs... so why the writers thought it necessary to pretend it was in the South is beyond me. <br /><br />One other thing in action pictures always puzzles me. Why do they always make the \"cocking\" sound effect when the character pulls out an automatic handgun? It seemed every other sound effect in this movie was a \"chuk-chich\" signifying a 9mm was loaded and ready to fire. Of course, the weapons already had rounds chambered so this was unnecessary. <br /><br />Lastly, the pyrotechnics were WAY over the top. But hey, this film was targeted to a certain 'market segment' I suppose... It's too bad.

{"value":"I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school & college. I am still a practicing Catholic but would not be considered a \"good Catholic\" in the church's eyes because I don't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to.<br /><br />So back to the movie...its bad because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead. There is no comedy in that and the satire is not done well by the over acting of Diane Keaton. I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be good.<br /><br />At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith. But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy...the tragedy of loss of life (besides the two former students...the lives of the aborted babies, the life of the student's mom), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God.
