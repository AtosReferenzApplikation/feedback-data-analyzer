{"value":"Not as bad, as it's credited to being (Hooper's done far worse) more so disappointing for me. Such an imaginative concept, which is never really tapped in to by Hooper with his economical direction and even less so in the smoky (excuse the pun) writing. It goes so sinister and over-the-top in a dead serious tone, becoming ridiculous and unfocused letting the whole pessimistic mystery / conspiracy-laced narrative being easily telegraphed to end on something completely abrupt. Because of that, the pacing goes on to be rather sluggish and Brad Dourif (cool to see him in a leading role) seems to struggle with an off-balanced performance, despite etching out a bemusedly quirky intensity to his off-colour character. Even though it's cheaply done, there's a competent technical attitude to it. However it doesn't seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster in nasty jolts (which some do work) and strikingly steaming special effects (flames, flames everywhere) instead. Hooper does display some stylishly frenetic imagery (more so towards the latter end), and the camera-work is swiftly manoeuvred and the beaming score is titillating. The performances are bit all over the shop with the appearances of William Prince, Cynthia Bain, Dey Young, Jon Cypher and Melinda Dillon. Also Geroge Buck Flower and John Landis have small, but amusing cameos especially Landis. Nothing surprises, but it's passably engaging.","finished_norm":["not","a","bad","a","it","credit","to","be","hooper","do","far","wrong","much","so","disappoint","for","me","such","a","imagin","concept","which","be","never","realli","tap","in","to","by","hooper","with","hi","econom","direct","and","even","littl","so","in","the","smoki","excus","the","pun","write","it","go","so","sinist","and","overthetop","in","a","dead","seriou","tone","becom","ridicul","and","unfocus","let","the","whole","pessimist","mysteri","conspiracylac","narr","be","easili","telegraph","to","end","on","someth","complet","abrupt","becaus","of","that","the","pace","go","on","to","be","rather","sluggish","and","brad","dourif","cool","to","see","him","in","a","lead","role","seem","to","struggl","with","a","offbalanc","perform","despit","etch","out","a","bemusedli","quirki","intens","to","hi","offcolour","charact","even","though","it","cheapli","do","there","a","compet","technic","attitud","to","it","howev","it","doe","not","seem","to","go","anywher","out","of","the","ordinari","with","it","idea","and","want","to","plaster","in","nasti","jolt","which","some","do","work","and","strikingli","steam","special","effect","flame","flame","everywher","instead","hooper","doe","displai","some","stylishli","frenet","imageri","much","so","toward","the","latter","end","and","the","camerawork","be","swiftli","manoeuvr","and","the","beam","score","be","titil","the","perform","be","bite","all","over","the","shop","with","the","appear","of","william","princ","cynthia","bain","dei","young","jon","cypher","and","melinda","dillon","conjur","gerog","buck","flower","and","john","landi","have","small","but","amus","cameo","especi","landi","noth","surpris","but","it","passabl","engag"],"filtered":["bad","credit","hooper","far","wrong","much","disappoint","imagin","concept","never","realli","tap","hooper","hi","econom","direct","even","littl","smoki","excus","pun","write","go","sinist","overthetop","dead","seriou","tone","becom","ridicul","unfocus","let","whole","pessimist","mysteri","conspiracylac","narr","easili","telegraph","end","someth","complet","abrupt","becaus","pace","go","rather","sluggish","brad","dourif","cool","see","lead","role","seem","struggl","offbalanc","perform","despit","etch","bemusedli","quirki","intens","hi","offcolour","charact","even","though","cheapli","compet","technic","attitud","howev","doe","seem","go","anywher","ordinari","idea","want","plaster","nasti","jolt","work","strikingli","steam","special","effect","flame","flame","everywher","instead","hooper","doe","displai","stylishli","frenet","imageri","much","toward","latter","end","camerawork","swiftli","manoeuvr","beam","score","titil","perform","bite","shop","appear","william","princ","cynthia","bain","dei","young","jon","cypher","melinda","dillon","conjur","gerog","buck","flower","john","landi","small","amus","cameo","especi","landi","noth","surpris","passabl","engag"],"filtered2":["bad","credit","hooper","far","wrong","disappoint","imagin","concept","never","realli","tap","hooper","econom","direct","even","littl","smoki","excus","pun","write","go","sinist","overthetop","dead","seriou","tone","becom","ridicul","unfocus","let","whole","pessimist","mysteri","conspiracylac","narr","easili","telegraph","end","someth","complet","abrupt","becaus","pace","go","rather","sluggish","brad","dourif","cool","see","lead","role","seem","struggl","offbalanc","perform","despit","etch","bemusedli","quirki","intens","offcolour","charact","even","though","cheapli","compet","technic","attitud","howev","doe","seem","go","anywher","ordinari","idea","want","plaster","nasti","jolt","work","strikingli","steam","special","effect","flame","flame","everywher","instead","hooper","doe","displai","stylishli","frenet","imageri","toward","latter","end","camerawork","swiftli","manoeuvr","beam","score","titil","perform","bite","shop","appear","william","princ","cynthia","bain","dei","young","jon","cypher","melinda","dillon","conjur","gerog","buck","flower","john","landi","small","amus","cameo","especi","landi","noth","surpris","passabl","engag"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,9,10,13,14,18,22,24,25,35,37,39,42,48,49,53,65,86,101,102,103,105,106,111,113,115,123,124,128,135,152,154,157,160,170,187,203,228,267,274,291,326,340,356,363,391,403,481,493,518,546,563,583,617,708,720,725,842,943,944,967,1052,1063,1198,1199,1292,1350,1361,1407,1433,1460,1822,1921,1957,2115,2386,2567,2578,2586,2670,2722,2827,2890,2942,3007,3062,3064,3070,3337,3935,4356,4520,4689,4783,4926,5551,6155,6650,6807,7005,7292,7397,7536,7582],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"

{"value":"OK this movie had a terrible premise. Be serious according to the movie they had just been through an apocalyptic war yet they have money to buy huge robots and pit them against each other. Each country decides instead of investing into rebuilding their country they would rather fight with robots no one could afford. Here's a better idea, lets rely on our most inept resource,jocks, to fight our battles. <br /><br />Everyone says what about the director, what about him. He makes a good movie, he makes a bad movie. There is no reason to give this movie some credit just because of the director, maybe he was asleep? I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, because it was so cheesy and ridiculous I had to laugh. I actually had a good time watching it, well except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be an assassin(trust me no one would see this guy as an assassin, so it is a surprise, however lame) What kind of training exercise is a jungle jim anyway. I was sad to see Mst3k had not done this one. I am giving a two star rating however because nothing could be as bad as \"manos the hands of fate.\"<br /><br />The budget does not matter either, I have seen plenty of reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like cube. The storyline was not even plausible and I have seen better acting in school plays. Surly they could have afforded an eleven year old from any middle school play.<br /><br />Anyway pick it up, it is a fun movie to watch.","finished_norm":["okai","thi","movi","have","a","terribl","premis","be","seriou","accord","to","the","movi","thei","have","just","be","through","a","apocalypt","war","yet","thei","have","monei","to","bui","huge","robot","and","pit","them","against","each","other","each","countri","decid","instead","of","invest","into","rebuild","their","countri","thei","would","rather","fight","with","robot","no","on","can","afford","here","a","well","idea","let","reli","on","our","much","inept","resourcejock","to","fight","our","battl","br","br","everyon","sai","what","about","the","director","what","about","him","he","make","a","good","movi","he","make","a","bad","movi","there","be","no","reason","to","give","thi","movi","some","credit","just","becaus","of","the","director","mayb","he","be","asleep","i","thoroughli","enjoi","thi","movi","becaus","it","be","so","cheesi","and","ridicul","i","have","to","laugh","i","actual","have","a","good","time","watch","it","good","except","for","the","cowboi","mentor","who","turn","out","to","be","a","assassintrust","me","no","on","would","see","thi","gui","a","a","assassin","so","it","be","a","surpris","howev","lame","what","kind","of","train","exercis","be","a","jungl","jim","anywai","i","be","sad","to","see","mstk","have","not","do","thi","on","i","be","give","a","two","star","rate","howev","becaus","noth","can","be","a","bad","a","mano","the","hand","of","fatebr","br","the","budget","doe","not","matt","either","i","have","see","plenti","of","reason","movi","that","have","noth","for","budget","like","cube","the","storylin","be","not","even","plausibl","and","i","have","see","well","act","in","school","plai","surli","thei","can","have","afford","a","eleven","year","old","from","ani","middl","school","playbr","br","anywai","pick","it","up","it","be","a","fun","movi","to","watch"],"filtered":["okai","thi","movi","terribl","premis","seriou","accord","movi","thei","apocalypt","war","yet","thei","monei","bui","huge","robot","pit","countri","decid","instead","invest","rebuild","countri","thei","rather","fight","robot","afford","well","idea","let","reli","much","inept","resourcejock","fight","battl","br","br","everyon","sai","director","make","good","movi","make","bad","movi","reason","give","thi","movi","credit","becaus","director","mayb","asleep","thoroughli","enjoi","thi","movi","becaus","cheesi","ridicul","laugh","actual","good","time","watch","good","except","cowboi","mentor","turn","assassintrust","see","thi","gui","assassin","surpris","howev","lame","kind","train","exercis","jungl","jim","anywai","sad","see","mstk","thi","give","two","star","rate","howev","becaus","noth","bad","mano","hand","fatebr","br","budget","doe","matt","either","see","plenti","reason","movi","noth","budget","like","cube","storylin","even","plausibl","see","well","act","school","plai","surli","thei","afford","eleven","year","old","ani","middl","school","playbr","br","anywai","pick","fun","movi","watch"],"filtered2":["okai","terribl","premis","seriou","accord","apocalypt","war","yet","monei","bui","huge","robot","pit","countri","decid","instead","invest","rebuild","countri","rather","fight","robot","afford","well","idea","let","reli","inept","resourcejock","fight","battl","everyon","director","make","good","make","bad","reason","give","credit","becaus","director","mayb","asleep","thoroughli","enjoi","becaus","cheesi","ridicul","laugh","actual","good","time","watch","good","except","cowboi","mentor","turn","assassintrust","see","gui","assassin","surpris","howev","lame","kind","train","exercis","jungl","jim","anywai","sad","see","mstk","give","two","star","rate","howev","becaus","noth","bad","mano","hand","fatebr","budget","doe","matt","either","see","plenti","reason","noth","budget","like","cube","storylin","even","plausibl","see","well","act","school","plai","surli","afford","eleven","year","old","ani","middl","school","playbr","anywai","pick","fun","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,8,9,18,20,21,22,27,30,40,47,49,52,55,57,58,67,95,96,100,113,122,123,124,126,133,152,160,163,166,191,194,200,202,207,232,233,235,246,249,256,259,274,296,314,326,347,356,373,386,408,444,446,455,484,493,515,543,554,608,713,786,888,1154,1346,1358,1379,1413,1426,1548,1590,1809,1936,2082,2156,2360,2406,2663,2705,3033,4442,5522,6952,7776,7925,8064],"values":[2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,8,9,18,20,21,22,27,30,40,47,49,52,55,57,58,67,95,96,100,113,122,123,124,126,133,152,160,163,166,191,194,200,202,207,232,233,235,246,249,256,259,274,296,314,326,347,356,373,386,408,444,446,455,484,493,515,543,554,608,713,786,888,1154

{"value":"warning:It contains spoilers. If a movie starts with a sex scene then it's a bad movie. (see for example 300). This one confirms the above lemma. The second scene constitutes the spinning center of all the action. The fact that we know the end makes the movie boring. Even more, other plots are revealed as the story goes back and forth several times. And this made more frustrated. To compensate the consequent lack of suspense, we learn more and more about how unbalanced are the characters. And oh yes, they have lots to show. Andy (P.Hoffman), for example, is a drug addict, more?, he is cheating his wife, more?, he plans to rob his father, more?, his wife is cheating with his brother, more?, he doesn't regret his complicity to his mother's death, more?, he is a serial killer, more? etc etc it's not enough space to write here... I wonder how could he have a top job. And why his wife didn't leave him before. On the other hand I enjoy much the performances of the actor Hoffman.<br /><br />Even here PSH saves what is left from my 7$ spent for this absurdity. Why absurdity? Because it doesn't have sense, why should I care for the despicable characters? Another broken lemma is that a movie should have a sympathetic( at least pleasant) character. <br /><br />Also it's a lot of sentimentality, for example we are supposed to care for the sufferance of the widowed father without knowing anything about the parents'lives before the crime.","finished_norm":["warningit","contain","spoiler","if","a","movi","start","with","a","sex","scene","then","it","a","bad","movi","see","for","exampl","thi","on","confirm","the","abov","lemma","the","scene","constitut","the","spin","center","of","all","the","action","the","fact","that","we","know","the","end","make","the","movi","bore","even","much","other","plot","be","reveal","a","the","stori","go","back","and","forth","sever","time","and","thi","make","much","frustrat","to","compens","the","consequ","lack","of","suspens","we","learn","much","and","much","about","how","unbal","be","the","charact","and","oh","ye","thei","have","lot","to","show","andi","phoffman","for","exampl","be","a","drug","addict","much","he","be","cheat","hi","wife","much","he","plan","to","rob","hi","father","much","hi","wife","be","cheat","with","hi","brother","much","he","doe","not","regret","hi","complic","to","hi","mother","death","much","he","be","a","serial","killer","much","etc","etc","it","not","enough","space","to","write","here","i","wonder","how","can","he","have","a","top","job","and","why","hi","wife","do","not","leav","him","befor","on","the","other","hand","i","enjoi","much","the","perform","of","the","actor","hoffmanbr","br","even","here","psh","save","what","be","leav","from","my","spend","for","thi","absurd","why","absurd","becaus","it","doe","not","have","sens","why","should","i","care","for","the","despic","charact","anoth","break","lemma","be","that","a","movi","should","have","a","sympathet","at","littl","pleasant","charact","br","br","conjur","it","a","lot","of","sentiment","for","exampl","we","be","suppos","to","care","for","the","suffer","of","the","widow","father","without","know","anyth","about","the","parent","live","befor","the","crime"],"filtered":["warningit","contain","spoiler","movi","start","sex","scene","bad","movi","see","exampl","thi","confirm","abov","lemma","scene","constitut","spin","center","action","fact","know","end","make","movi","bore","even","much","plot","reveal","stori","go","back","forth","sever","time","thi","make","much","frustrat","compens","consequ","lack","suspens","learn","much","much","unbal","charact","oh","ye","thei","lot","show","andi","phoffman","exampl","drug","addict","much","cheat","hi","wife","much","plan","rob","hi","father","much","hi","wife","cheat","hi","brother","much","doe","regret","hi","complic","hi","mother","death","much","serial","killer","much","etc","etc","enough","space","write","wonder","top","job","hi","wife","leav","befor","hand","enjoi","much","perform","actor","hoffmanbr","br","even","psh","save","leav","spend","thi","absurd","absurd","becaus","doe","sens","care","despic","charact","anoth","break","lemma","movi","sympathet","littl","pleasant","charact","br","br","conjur","lot","sentiment","exampl","suppos","care","suffer","widow","father","without","know","anyth","parent","live","befor","crime"],"filtered2":["warningit","contain","spoiler","start","sex","scene","bad","see","exampl","confirm","abov","lemma","scene","constitut","spin","center","action","fact","know","end","make","bore","even","plot","reveal","stori","go","back","forth","sever","time","make","frustrat","compens","consequ","lack","suspens","learn","unbal","charact","oh","ye","lot","show","andi","phoffman","exampl","drug","addict","cheat","wife","plan","rob","father","wife","cheat","brother","doe","regret","complic","mother","death","serial","killer","etc","etc","enough","space","write","wonder","top","job","wife","leav","befor","hand","enjoi","perform","actor","hoffmanbr","even","psh","save","leav","spend","absurd","absurd","becaus","doe","sens","care","despic","charact","anoth","break","lemma","sympathet","littl","pleasant","charact","conjur","lot","sentiment","exampl","suppos","care","suffer","widow","father","without","know","anyth","parent","live","befor","crime"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,6,8,9,10,14,17,18,19,22,24,26,28,32,39,41,63,65,71,72,73,74,79,93,97,104,105,108,116,125,129,149,173,175,183,189,200,205,209,234,235,245,252,254,263,283,289,307,316,343,360,364,381,397,429,431,490,529,581,633,637,670,697,704,711,753,833,928,1134,1314,1366,1405,1553,1647,1678,1808,2064,2101,2211,2278,2306,2311,2642,2988,3089,3169,4275,5023,6954],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,6,8,9,10,14,17,18,19,22,24,26,28,32,39,41,63,65,71,72,73,74,79,93,97,104,105,108,116,125,129,149,173,175,183,189,200,205,209,234,235,245,252,254,263,283,289,307,316,343,360,364,381,397,429,431,490,529,581,633,637,670,697,704,711,753,833,928,1134,1314,1366,1405,1553,1647,1678,1808,2064,2101,2211,2278,2306,2311,2

{"value":"A doctor who is trying to complete the medical dream of transplantation is experimenting secretly on corpses from the hospital with varying success. His final best chance comes when he lovingly wraps his girlfriend's head in his jacket as he rescues it from a burning vehicle.<br /><br />I was looking for cheese and with this premise I believed I found it. It has everything everything that bad movie hunters look for - chest and brain surgery with the surgeons leaving with pristine white scrubs, unique camera angles (I always love watching the rear passenger wheels of cars), cheesy clarinet stripper music, and one of the longest death scenes in movie history. But unfortunately these so-bad-they-are-good moments can't overcome the too-bad-they-stink stretches.<br /><br />Jan in the Pan annoyed me, with her droning monologues in a hoarse whisper, the somewhat less than evil laughter, and the fact she was kept alive with some Columbian home brew coffee and 2 DD batteries.<br /><br />I couldn't even entertain myself with Dr Bill's horrid overacting and moral self righteousness. Usually such ham makes these movies a must see in my opinion, in this case I was bored with it.<br /><br />The best part of the movie in my opinion was the 1960's version of \"body shopping\" and I even found myself nodding off during that.<br /><br />Don't spend money on this one - there are better bad movies out there to entertain your sick sense of humor.","finished_norm":["a","doctor","who","be","try","to","complet","the","medic","dream","of","transplant","be","experi","secretli","on","corps","from","the","hospit","with","vari","success","hi","final","well","chanc","come","when","he","lovingli","wrap","hi","girlfriend","head","in","hi","jacket","a","he","rescu","it","from","a","burn","vehiclebr","br","i","be","look","for","chees","and","with","thi","premis","i","believ","i","find","it","it","have","everyth","everyth","that","bad","movi","hunter","look","for","chest","and","brain","surgeri","with","the","surgeon","leav","with","pristin","white","scrub","uniqu","camera","angl","i","alwai","love","watch","the","rear","passeng","wheel","of","car","cheesi","clarinet","stripper","music","and","on","of","the","long","death","scene","in","movi","histori","but","unfortun","thi","sobadtheyaregood","moment","ca","not","overcom","the","toobadtheystink","stretchesbr","br","jan","in","the","pan","annoi","me","with","her","drone","monologu","in","a","hoars","whisper","the","somewhat","littl","than","evil","laughter","and","the","fact","she","be","keep","aliv","with","some","columbian","home","brew","coffe","and","dd","batteriesbr","br","i","can","not","even","entertain","myself","with","dr","bill","horrid","overact","and","moral","self","righteous","usual","such","ham","make","thi","movi","a","must","see","in","my","opinion","in","thi","case","i","be","bore","with","itbr","br","the","well","part","of","the","movi","in","my","opinion","be","the","version","of","bodi","shop","and","i","even","find","myself","nod","off","dure","thatbr","br","do","not","spend","monei","on","thi","on","there","be","well","bad","movi","out","there","to","entertain","your","sick","sens","of","humor"],"filtered":["doctor","try","complet","medic","dream","transplant","experi","secretli","corps","hospit","vari","success","hi","final","well","chanc","come","lovingli","wrap","hi","girlfriend","head","hi","jacket","rescu","burn","vehiclebr","br","look","chees","thi","premis","believ","find","everyth","everyth","bad","movi","hunter","look","chest","brain","surgeri","surgeon","leav","pristin","white","scrub","uniqu","camera","angl","alwai","love","watch","rear","passeng","wheel","car","cheesi","clarinet","stripper","music","long","death","scene","movi","histori","unfortun","thi","sobadtheyaregood","moment","ca","overcom","toobadtheystink","stretchesbr","br","jan","pan","annoi","drone","monologu","hoars","whisper","somewhat","littl","evil","laughter","fact","keep","aliv","columbian","home","brew","coffe","dd","batteriesbr","br","even","entertain","dr","bill","horrid","overact","moral","self","righteous","usual","ham","make","thi","movi","must","see","opinion","thi","case","bore","itbr","br","well","part","movi","opinion","version","bodi","shop","even","find","nod","dure","thatbr","br","spend","monei","thi","well","bad","movi","entertain","sick","sens","humor"],"filtered2":["doctor","try","complet","medic","dream","transplant","experi","secretli","corps","hospit","vari","success","final","well","chanc","come","lovingli","wrap","girlfriend","head","jacket","rescu","burn","vehiclebr","look","chees","premis","believ","find","everyth","everyth","bad","hunter","look","chest","brain","surgeri","surgeon","leav","pristin","white","scrub","uniqu","camera","angl","alwai","love","watch","rear","passeng","wheel","car","cheesi","clarinet","stripper","music","long","death","scene","histori","unfortun","sobadtheyaregood","moment","ca","overcom","toobadtheystink","stretchesbr","jan","pan","annoi","drone","monologu","hoars","whisper","somewhat","littl","evil","laughter","fact","keep","aliv","columbian","home","brew","coffe","dd","batteriesbr","even","entertain","dr","bill","horrid","overact","moral","self","righteous","usual","ham","make","must","see","opinion","case","bore","itbr","well","part","opinion","version","bodi","shop","even","find","nod","dure","thatbr","spend","monei","well","bad","entertain","sick","sens","humor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,9,14,16,19,20,34,36,38,54,61,74,81,91,97,99,103,108,118,126,134,141,156,173,188,193,195,197,208,220,227,231,239,245,265,271,283,284,288,302,321,333,359,369,376,430,484,486,499,532,538,543,596,607,673,692,722,730,739,778,862,878,1048,1108,1143,1190,1260,1293,1300,1415,1433,1571,1600,1733,1810,1861,1898,1989,2198,2364,2604,2613,2797,2904,2955,3200,3208,3310,3385,3547,3615,3674,3837,4251,4391,4401,4898,5514,5948,6753,7991],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,9,14,16,19,20,34,36,38,54,61,74,81,91,97,99,103,

{"value":"I was very excited about this film when I first saw the previews. Normally I see a preview this good and I buy the film outright. Something told me to... you know watch it first. I'm glad I did. Keira Knightley ruined all future films for me with this role. In the 2nd Pirates movie when it came out I went to see it. All I saw was Domino Harvey and I hated her more for it. I think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for Domino.<br /><br />Domino who? Who is Domino Harvey? I still don't really know or care. I don't know who she was in real life or who she was in this film. I didn't care about her character and even Keira getting partically naked didn't make it worth the movie. The direction was definitely lacking. The writing was trite and shallow. The editing was horrible. I don't mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it. There's a place for it. Good examples of choppy, MTV style, colorful editing (not sure if there's an official name) would be Fight Club; just off the top of my head. Even Enemy of the State had a semi similar editing style at parts. It was used tastefully and wasn't used as a crutch. I mean this is the same guy who directed Top Gun and Crimson Tide. Tony Scott please give me my time back.<br /><br />I understand there are many people who liked this movie. I guess the idea that you'll either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment. Frankly, I hate it.","finished_norm":["i","be","veri","excit","about","thi","film","when","i","see","the","preview","normal","i","see","a","preview","thi","good","and","i","bui","the","film","outright","someth","tell","me","to","you","know","watch","it","i","be","glad","i","do","keira","knightlei","ruin","all","futur","film","for","me","with","thi","role","in","the","nd","pirat","movi","when","it","come","out","i","go","to","see","it","all","i","see","be","domino","harvei","and","i","hate","her","much","for","it","i","think","that","have","to","do","with","her","hair","and","have","to","cut","it","short","for","dominobr","br","domino","who","who","be","domino","harvei","i","still","do","not","realli","know","or","care","i","do","not","know","who","she","be","in","real","life","or","who","she","be","in","thi","film","i","do","not","care","about","her","charact","and","even","keira","get","partic","nake","do","not","make","it","worth","the","movi","the","direct","be","definit","lack","the","write","be","trite","and","shallow","the","edit","be","horribl","i","do","not","mind","the","styl","so","much","a","the","poor","overus","of","it","there","a","place","for","it","good","exampl","of","choppi","mtv","styl","color","edit","not","sure","if","there","a","offici","name","would","be","fight","club","just","off","the","top","of","my","head","even","enemi","of","the","state","have","a","semi","similar","edit","styl","at","part","it","be","us","tastefulli","and","be","not","us","a","a","crutch","i","mean","thi","be","the","same","gui","who","direct","top","gun","and","crimson","tide","toni","scott","pleas","give","me","my","time","backbr","br","i","understand","there","be","mani","peopl","who","like","thi","movi","i","guess","the","idea","that","you","will","either","complet","love","thi","movi","or","complet","hate","it","be","a","fair","assess","frankli","i","hate","it"],"filtered":["veri","excit","thi","film","see","preview","normal","see","preview","thi","good","bui","film","outright","someth","tell","know","watch","glad","keira","knightlei","ruin","futur","film","thi","role","nd","pirat","movi","come","go","see","see","domino","harvei","hate","much","think","hair","cut","short","dominobr","br","domino","domino","harvei","still","realli","know","care","know","real","life","thi","film","care","charact","even","keira","get","partic","nake","make","worth","movi","direct","definit","lack","write","trite","shallow","edit","horribl","mind","styl","much","poor","overus","place","good","exampl","choppi","mtv","styl","color","edit","sure","offici","name","fight","club","top","head","even","enemi","state","semi","similar","edit","styl","part","us","tastefulli","us","crutch","mean","thi","gui","direct","top","gun","crimson","tide","toni","scott","pleas","give","time","backbr","br","understand","mani","peopl","like","thi","movi","guess","idea","either","complet","love","thi","movi","complet","hate","fair","assess","frankli","hate"],"filtered2":["veri","excit","see","preview","normal","see","preview","good","bui","outright","someth","tell","know","watch","glad","keira","knightlei","ruin","futur","role","nd","pirat","come","go","see","see","domino","harvei","hate","think","hair","cut","short","dominobr","domino","domino","harvei","still","realli","know","care","know","real","life","care","charact","even","keira","get","partic","nake","make","worth","direct","definit","lack","write","trite","shallow","edit","horribl","mind","styl","poor","overus","place","good","exampl","choppi","mtv","styl","color","edit","sure","offici","name","fight","club","top","head","even","enemi","state","semi","similar","edit","styl","part","us","tastefulli","us","crutch","mean","gui","direct","top","gun","crimson","tide","toni","scott","pleas","give","time","backbr","understand","mani","peopl","like","guess","idea","either","complet","love","complet","hate","fair","assess","frankli","hate"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,13,15,23,26,30,34,50,53,54,55,56,61,64,65,75,80,88,90,102,103,119,123,128,143,146,164,183,205,207,208,212,219,230,233,238,243,272,303,307,339,346,347,348,364,380,392,498,501,524,589,700,710,813,844,875,877,893,930,1035,1150,1227,1333,1456,1564,1752,1974,2556,2909,2915,3111,3213,3528,3611,3876,4072,4340,4567,6030,7701,8345],"values":[1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,13,15,23,26,30,34,50,53,54,55,56,61,64,65,75,80,88,90,102,103,119,123,128,143,146,164,183,205,207,208,212,219,230,233,238,243,272,303,307,339,346,347,348,364,380,392,498,501,524,589,700,710,813,844,875,877,893,930,1035,1150,1227,1333,1456,1564,1752,1974,25

{"value":"My dear Lord,what a movie! Let's talk about the \"special effects\" first. Don't get me wrong here, I am not one of those effect fanatics but I was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past, mainly the 60's. So for some time I thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it. But as far as I know they did not have cell phones in the 60's...<br /><br />What I am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message. Acting is secondary, effects are secondary, I do not even mind a few little inconsistencies. However, in a movies like this bad acting, incredibility, etc. add up to make a bad movie even worse - that's what happened for me with the Celestine Prophecy.<br /><br />My wife said the book was actually really good and even though I am not into all that spiritual stuff I can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way - the movie failed to do so.<br /><br />There could be one single reason to watch this one though. If you really love cheesy movies it'll be the right one for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality I MUST have rated this movie ten stars.<br /><br />By the way, three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there, like \"Critical Mass\" (look up the comments on that one - hilarious). The Celestine Prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree.","finished_norm":["my","dear","lordwhat","a","movi","let","talk","about","the","special","effect","do","not","get","me","wrong","here","i","be","not","on","of","that","effect","fanat","but","i","be","truli","think","that","superimposit","be","a","practic","of","the","long","go","past","mainli","the","so","for","some","time","i","think","thei","mai","have","record","thi","movi","a","long","time","ago","and","it","take","them","forev","to","cut","and","releas","it","but","a","far","a","i","know","thei","do","not","have","cell","phone","in","the","sbr","br","what","i","be","look","for","in","movi","be","mainli","a","good","stori","with","a","realli","good","messag","act","be","secondari","effect","be","secondari","i","do","not","even","mind","a","few","littl","inconsist","howev","in","a","movi","like","thi","bad","act","incred","etc","add","up","to","make","a","bad","movi","even","wrong","that","what","happen","for","me","with","the","celestin","prophecybr","br","my","wife","sai","the","book","be","actual","realli","good","and","even","though","i","be","not","into","all","that","spiritu","stuff","i","can","somehow","see","that","it","can","be","bring","across","in","a","believ","wai","the","movi","fail","to","do","sobr","br","there","can","be","on","singl","reason","to","watch","thi","on","though","if","you","realli","love","cheesi","movi","it","will","be","the","right","on","for","you","if","the","imdb","star","be","for","cheesi","instead","of","qualiti","i","must","have","rate","thi","movi","ten","starsbr","br","by","the","wai","three","star","be","for","the","fact","that","there","be","wrong","movi","out","there","like","critic","mass","look","up","the","comment","on","that","on","hilari","the","celestin","propheci","be","at","littl","entertain","to","a","certain","degre"],"filtered":["dear","lordwhat","movi","let","talk","special","effect","get","wrong","effect","fanat","truli","think","superimposit","practic","long","go","past","mainli","time","think","thei","mai","record","thi","movi","long","time","ago","take","forev","cut","releas","far","know","thei","cell","phone","sbr","br","look","movi","mainli","good","stori","realli","good","messag","act","secondari","effect","secondari","even","mind","littl","inconsist","howev","movi","like","thi","bad","act","incred","etc","add","make","bad","movi","even","wrong","happen","celestin","prophecybr","br","wife","sai","book","actual","realli","good","even","though","spiritu","stuff","somehow","see","bring","across","believ","wai","movi","fail","sobr","br","singl","reason","watch","thi","though","realli","love","cheesi","movi","right","imdb","star","cheesi","instead","qualiti","must","rate","thi","movi","ten","starsbr","br","wai","three","star","fact","wrong","movi","like","critic","mass","look","comment","hilari","celestin","propheci","littl","entertain","certain","degre"],"filtered2":["dear","lordwhat","let","talk","special","effect","get","wrong","effect","fanat","truli","think","superimposit","practic","long","go","past","mainli","time","think","mai","record","long","time","ago","take","forev","cut","releas","far","know","cell","phone","sbr","look","mainli","good","stori","realli","good","messag","act","secondari","effect","secondari","even","mind","littl","inconsist","howev","like","bad","act","incred","etc","add","make","bad","even","wrong","happen","celestin","prophecybr","wife","book","actual","realli","good","even","though","spiritu","stuff","somehow","see","bring","across","believ","wai","fail","sobr","singl","reason","watch","though","realli","love","cheesi","right","imdb","star","cheesi","instead","qualiti","must","rate","ten","starsbr","wai","three","star","fact","wrong","like","critic","mass","look","comment","hilari","celestin","propheci","littl","entertain","certain","degre"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,16,17,21,25,26,31,33,46,52,54,86,91,94,95,97,99,100,101,106,113,121,124,141,151,152,186,195,202,203,215,224,238,250,263,280,299,303,319,327,342,361,429,440,443,503,543,545,549,569,579,591,610,632,774,917,983,1020,1210,1324,1418,1624,1731,1830,1983,2157,2444,3152,3473,3828,3994,4281,5648],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,16,17,21,25,26,31,33,46,52,54,86,91,94,95,97,99,100,101,106,113,121,124,141,151,152,186,195,202,203,215,224,238,250,263,280,299,303,319,327,342,361,429,440,443,503,543,545,549,569,579,591,610,632,774,917,983,1020,1210,1324,1418,1624,1731,1830,1983,2157,2444,3152,3473,3828,3994,4281,5648],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,2.7780

{"value":"Yes, about the only thing this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood. Here though is not a movie that is going to showcase his talents much at all and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat entertaining about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through. Yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, an after school type special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the makers of this film thought that nerds should not have fun of any sort unless they were going to go out and do underage drinking, drugs, having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing. No, these bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain, heaven's no! Not that, if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there. Yes, I think this movie is utterly stupid and a waste of time.

{"value":"End of the World is an uneventful movie, which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth. The main character is some kind of scientist, I'm not exactly sure what kind. He has two jobs at a government(?) facility guarded by four security men. His first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space (although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job #2). Job #2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark room...at least that's the best I can figure. Apparently the \"plant\" is not exactly top-secret, as the scientist brings his wife there. She hangs out (they're on their way to a dinner) while he discovers a message from space: Major Earth Disruption, repeated over and over. He says something about it being the first message from space he's ever been able to decipher; his wife tells him they're going to be late for the dinner party. So they leave and go to the party (!?!). Moments later he finds out that China has suffered a major earthquake. From there, the movie goes... nowhere! Yes, Christopher Lee is in it, but that really doesn't help much. Besides, Lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in Howling II. This movie is boring, but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like Christopher Lee or Z-grade sci-fi. Plus, there's lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed.","finished_norm":["end","of","the","world","be","a","unev","movi","which","be","odd","sinc","it","be","suppos","to","be","about","the","total","destruct","of","the","earth","the","main","charact","be","some","kind","of","scientist","i","be","not","exactli","sure","what","kind","he","have","two","job","at","a","govern","facil","guard","by","four","secur","man","hi","job","be","monitor","transmiss","to","and","from","space","although","thi","actual","seem","much","like","a","hobbi","he","doe","when","not","work","on","job","job","requir","him","to","put","on","a","protect","suit","and","go","into","a","dark","roomat","littl","that","the","well","i","can","figur","appar","the","plant","be","not","exactli","topsecret","a","the","scientist","bring","hi","wife","there","she","hang","out","thei","re","on","their","wai","to","a","dinner","while","he","discov","a","messag","from","space","major","earth","disrupt","repeat","over","and","over","he","sai","someth","about","it","be","the","messag","from","space","he","ever","be","abl","to","deciph","hi","wife","tell","him","thei","re","go","to","be","late","for","the","dinner","parti","so","thei","leav","and","go","to","the","parti","moment","late","he","find","out","that","china","have","suffer","a","major","earthquak","from","there","the","movi","go","nowher","ye","christoph","lee","be","in","it","but","that","realli","doe","not","help","much","besid","lee","give","a","lacklust","perform","along","the","line","of","hi","appear","in","howl","ii","thi","movi","be","bore","but","it","have","enough","stupid","elem","that","you","mai","want","to","suffer","through","it","onc","if","you","like","christoph","lee","or","zgrade","scifi","plu","there","lot","of","stock","footag","of","the","earth","be","destroi"],"filtered":["end","world","unev","movi","odd","sinc","suppos","total","destruct","earth","main","charact","kind","scientist","exactli","sure","kind","two","job","govern","facil","guard","four","secur","man","hi","job","monitor","transmiss","space","although","thi","actual","seem","much","like","hobbi","doe","work","job","job","requir","put","protect","suit","go","dark","roomat","littl","well","figur","appar","plant","exactli","topsecret","scientist","bring","hi","wife","hang","thei","re","wai","dinner","discov","messag","space","major","earth","disrupt","repeat","sai","someth","messag","space","ever","abl","deciph","hi","wife","tell","thei","re","go","late","dinner","parti","thei","leav","go","parti","moment","late","find","china","suffer","major","earthquak","movi","go","nowher","ye","christoph","lee","realli","doe","help","much","besid","lee","give","lacklust","perform","along","line","hi","appear","howl","ii","thi","movi","bore","enough","stupid","elem","mai","want","suffer","onc","like","christoph","lee","zgrade","scifi","plu","lot","stock","footag","earth","destroi"],"filtered2":["end","world","unev","odd","sinc","suppos","total","destruct","earth","main","charact","kind","scientist","exactli","sure","kind","two","job","govern","facil","guard","four","secur","man","job","monitor","transmiss","space","although","actual","seem","like","hobbi","doe","work","job","job","requir","put","protect","suit","go","dark","roomat","littl","well","figur","appar","plant","exactli","topsecret","scientist","bring","wife","hang","re","wai","dinner","discov","messag","space","major","earth","disrupt","repeat","someth","messag","space","ever","abl","deciph","wife","tell","re","go","late","dinner","parti","leav","go","parti","moment","late","find","china","suffer","major","earthquak","go","nowher","ye","christoph","lee","realli","doe","help","besid","lee","give","lacklust","perform","along","line","appear","howl","ii","bore","enough","stupid","elem","mai","want","suffer","onc","like","christoph","lee","zgrade","scifi","plu","lot","stock","footag","earth","destroi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,10,13,14,18,20,24,30,33,35,37,38,44,45,46,47,48,52,53,68,72,74,90,93,105,107,108,119,122,136,149,150,159,162,165,170,179,184,185,188,209,236,237,250,263,289,308,324,368,404,415,454,462,479,522,569,570,606,633,637,658,738,749,772,781,783,799,805,848,850,884,972,986,989,1103,1162,1169,1232,1310,1570,1592,2132,2424,2582,2741,2882,3591,4190,4304,5280,6333,6451,7807,8286],"values":[2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,10,13,14,18,20,24,30,33,35,37,38,44,45,46,47,48,52,53,68,72,74,90,93,105,107,108,119,122,136,149,150,159,162,165,170,179,184,185,188,209,236,237,250,263,289,308,324,368,404,415,454,462,479,522,569,570,606,633,637,658,738,749,772,781,783,799,805,848,850,884,972,986,989,1

{"value":"I thought it was a New-York located movie: wrong! It's a little British countryside setting.<br /><br />I thought it was a comedy: wrong! It's a drama.... Well, up to the last third, because after the story becomes totally \"abracadabrantesque\", the symbolic word for a French presidential mandate. It means, close to nonsense even it the motives would like to bring a sincere feeling.<br /><br />What Do I have left? Maybe, a good duo of actress: Yes, I know, they are 3 friends, but the redhead policewoman is a bit invisible for me. The tall doctoress surprises by her punch, and McDowell delivers a fine acting as usual, all in delicate, soft and almost mute attitude. This gentleness puzzles me, because as other fine artists or directors, the same pattern is repeating over and over. In her case, it's like, whatever the movie, it's always the same character defined by her feelings, her values, who lives infinite different stories. I still don't know how to set the limit (or the fusion) between the artists and the works.<br /><br />Another positive side of this movie is its feminine touch & the interesting different points of view. The women have each their own way of living, even if they are all single. It brings a lot of tolerance and learning to witness how a same and unique reality can be perceived in as many ways as people.<br /><br />Finally, the movie is quite viewable, but the great final cuts the desire of a next

{"value":"Basically a typical propaganda film for the last good war. But there were a couple things that struck me. First was the use of mouthed epithets. In two cases the Scott character mouths one, once at the beginning when he drops his bomb off target during the bomb-off (\"dammit\") and once when he is trying to sway a bombardier into being a pilot (\"s*%t\"). I could be wrong about the second instance but I replayed it several times and that's what it looks like to me. The third case is when the Anne Shirley character wishes the O'Brien character goodbye and good luck (\"Give 'em hell\") over the roar of the engines. She must have thought that was too unladylike because she clearly says \"heck\". I also found interesting the character that has moral problems with bombing, specifically bombing civilians. The avuncular superior officer assures him that only military targets will be hit due to the precision of the bombsight used. Given what we know about the LeMay's later strategy of firebombing Japanese cities into oblivion this scene plays with not a little irony. I remember McNamara's quoting of LeMay in \"The Fog of War\", something to the effect that if the US did not win the conflict he would be tried as a war criminal. The ending is way overwrought, in keeping with the movie. It reminded me a bit of the end of White Heat (I'm not comparing the films, just the ending!). Maybe it's just 'cause he gets blowed up.

{"value":"Another weak third-season entry, 'Is There In Truth No Beauty?' nonetheless has at least one key plot element that is very different and as Spock would say, fascinating. The main character is an alien who must be carried around in a black box because his appearance is so horrendous that it drives humans insane. It's too bad the episode cannot live up to this incredible premise. Obviously, I think, it was a mistake to ever 'show' the alien, as its actual visage in no way even approximates such a daunting build-up; all we get is the standard Star Trek psychedelic light display used for any number of things in different episodes, usually when the ship is passing through a magnetic storm or something similar. In any event, Kollos' appearance can at least be tolerated by Mr. Spock, and then only if Spock is wearing a special visor. (For the longest time, I thought the alien's name was 'Carlos,' which I found humorous, but I digress.) Spock is required to mind-meld with Kollos at one point so that the alien can pilot the Enterprise back to safety. This is accomplished, but when Spock/Kollos go back to end the mind-meld, by golly, Spock forgets his visor. Uh oh. He goes crazy but eventually recovers with the help of Kollos' assistant, a blind woman with psychic powers. This might have been a really bizarre, excellent episode but it is poorly directed and comes across as yet one more badly executed show of the series' last season.","finished_norm":["anoth","weak","thirdseason","entri","be","there","in","truth","no","beauti","nonetheless","have","at","littl","on","kei","plot","elem","that","be","veri","differ","and","a","spock","would","sai","fascin","the","main","charact","be","a","alien","who","must","be","carri","around","in","a","black","box","becaus","hi","appear","be","so","horrend","that","it","drive","human","insan","it","too","bad","the","episod","cannot","live","up","to","thi","incred","premis","obvious","i","think","it","be","a","mistak","to","ever","show","the","alien","a","it","actual","visag","in","no","wai","even","approxim","such","a","daunt","buildup","all","we","get","be","the","standard","star","trek","psychedel","light","displai","us","for","ani","numb","of","thing","in","differ","episod","usual","when","the","ship","be","pass","through","a","magnet","storm","or","someth","similar","in","ani","event","kollo","appear","can","at","littl","be","toler","by","mr","spock","and","then","onli","if","spock","be","wear","a","special","visor","for","the","long","time","i","think","the","alien","name","be","carlo","which","i","find","humor","but","i","digress","spock","be","requir","to","mindmeld","with","kollo","at","on","point","so","that","the","alien","can","pilot","the","enterpris","back","to","safeti","thi","be","accomplish","but","when","spockkollo","go","back","to","end","the","mindmeld","by","golli","spock","forget","hi","visor","uh","oh","he","go","crazi","but","eventu","recov","with","the","help","of","kollo","assist","a","blind","woman","with","psychic","power","thi","mai","have","be","a","realli","bizarr","excel","episod","but","it","be","poorli","direct","and","come","across","a","yet","on","much","badli","execut","show","of","the","seri","last","season"],"filtered":["anoth","weak","thirdseason","entri","truth","beauti","nonetheless","littl","kei","plot","elem","veri","differ","spock","sai","fascin","main","charact","alien","must","carri","around","black","box","becaus","hi","appear","horrend","drive","human","insan","bad","episod","live","thi","incred","premis","obvious","think","mistak","ever","show","alien","actual","visag","wai","even","approxim","daunt","buildup","get","standard","star","trek","psychedel","light","displai","us","ani","numb","thing","differ","episod","usual","ship","pass","magnet","storm","someth","similar","ani","event","kollo","appear","littl","toler","mr","spock","onli","spock","wear","special","visor","long","time","think","alien","name","carlo","find","humor","digress","spock","requir","mindmeld","kollo","point","alien","pilot","enterpris","back","safeti","thi","accomplish","spockkollo","go","back","end","mindmeld","golli","spock","forget","hi","visor","uh","oh","go","crazi","eventu","recov","help","kollo","assist","blind","woman","psychic","power","thi","mai","realli","bizarr","excel","episod","poorli","direct","come","across","yet","much","badli","execut","show","seri","last","season"],"filtered2":["anoth","weak","thirdseason","entri","truth","beauti","nonetheless","littl","kei","plot","elem","veri","differ","spock","fascin","main","charact","alien","must","carri","around","black","box","becaus","appear","horrend","drive","human","insan","bad","live","incred","premis","obvious","think","mistak","ever","show","alien","actual","visag","wai","even","approxim","daunt","buildup","get","standard","star","trek","psychedel","light","displai","us","ani","numb","thing","differ","usual","ship","pass","magnet","storm","someth","similar","ani","event","kollo","appear","littl","toler","mr","spock","onli","spock","wear","special","visor","long","time","think","alien","name","carlo","find","humor","digress","spock","requir","mindmeld","kollo","point","alien","pilot","enterpris","back","safeti","accomplish","spockkollo","go","back","end","mindmeld","golli","spock","forget","visor","uh","oh","go","crazi","eventu","recov","help","kollo","assist","blind","woman","psychic","power","mai","realli","bizarr","excel","poorli","direct","come","across","yet","badli","execut","show","last","season"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,22,24,27,28,29,32,33,34,38,44,46,52,53,56,63,66,70,73,98,99,100,102,116,141,143,144,170,179,185,194,203,204,229,234,265,292,325,341,353,357,365,369,372,379,398,448,461,470,479,484,487,503,514,516,565,580,589,592,616,621,654,662,712,716,758,817,823,987,989,1063,1236,1257,1285,1418,1430,1493,1621,1675,1681,2000,2303,2304,2402,2568,2702,2880,3711,3840,4584,4614,4835,5400,5657,5745,5975],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size

{"value":"Perhaps I missed the meeting when the meaning of \"B-movie\" was explained, but what I just saw was ridiculous. You want a good synopsis of this movie? Take Aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires, then remove everything that was good about it, and that's pretty much it.<br /><br />5 minutes into the movie, the \"V-SAN squad\" (that's the dumbest acronym I've ever heard) checks out a \"base\" thats been massacred by vampires and then they climb down (DOWN? What?) a ladder obviously attached to a billboard with an obvious present day train in the background. When is this supposed to take place? 2210. Okay...(hold on, I'll get back to that)<br /><br />Yeah. the characters. Wow, well there's the token lesbian Asian chick, the redneck cowboy wannabe, the weathered captain, the goth vampire/Hot Topic part-time cashier, and the wussy noob second in command. All of them are played by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition. It almost pained me to see Micheal Ironside in this flick. Isn't he getting enough money being the voice of Sam Fisher in Splinter Cell? Pretty much the only thing original about Vampire Wars is about how bad it is.<br /><br />Watching this afterbirth of a film, the only amusement I got was from the feeble attempts at set-making. Since when does taping PCI computer cards on a wall count as a ready room on a starship? The money required to do this film could have been put to much more better

{"value":"I have to confess that I am severely disappointed.<br /><br />This version can in no way compete with the version of 1995. The reason why I watched it was that I wasn't entirely happy with Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth and thought that Rupert Penry-Jones looked much more like the Captain I had imagined when I read the book. And he was too.<br /><br />Unfortunately that is the only redeeming quality of the film. The rest is as un-Austen-like as possible.<br /><br />Miss Elliot would NEVER have run through the streets of Bath like this. It wasn't in her character and it just wasn't done by a lady of the those times. The Anne Elliot of the book was a lady and she had dignity. There are other painful anachronisms but this was the worst.<br /><br />Although there are 3 important quotes from the book, they are at entirely inappropriate moments, warning those who know the book that yet another important part of the book will either be missing or completely changed.<br /><br />And although this version is not much shorter than the other one, it feels like everything is rushed. Very little care was taken to introduce the characters, show their dispositions and motives. Important scenes were omitted. How could they possibly have butchered the final scenes in this way ?

{"value":"In his brief 40 years on Earth, author Jack London managed to cram as much adventure and incident as would seem possible. This 90-minute film, purportedly a biography of the man's life but patently fictionalized, doesn't even scratch the surface, and remains a story very ripe for a modern-day retelling. Here, Michael O'Shea, in one of his first roles, portrays London, and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic. He is not the problem here. Nor is a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, playing his future wife, Charmian, whose biography on London is the \"basis\" for this film. London's life has here been broken down into a series of episodes, which the film skips lightly through. So we have brief incidents with London as an oyster pirate, a sealer in the Bering Sea, a gold prospector in the Yukon and a correspondent during the Russo-Japanese War...colorful events, for sure, but hardly given anything like in-depth treatment. And Alfred Santell's direction (he also directed one of Susan's first films, \"Our Leading Citizen,\" in 1939) is lackadaisical at best. Making things rougher here is a very poor-quality DVD, with a crummy-looking print source and hissy sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, was one of the DVD's extras: a catalog of all the Alpha Video films, featuring hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters.

{"value":"This was god awful. The story was all over the place and more often than not I was confused because of horrible editing. I felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough. They were extremely superficial people with no dimension. Cheesy, cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere. The stripper chick was just a distraction, even if she was decent looking. I don't know what this was attempting to be, but how shocked was I when they showed this trash on Sundance? I almost cancelled my subscription. You'd think a channel like that would show more quality films. There are much, much better gay and lesbian themed films out there. \"The Celluloid Closet\" is an excellent documentary. I thoroughly enjoyed \"Wigstock: The Movie\". I'm sure there are others that have slipped my mind at the moment, but what I'm trying to say is that this just wasn't worth it. If you catch it on TV, ok, but otherwise don't bother.<br /><br />There were maybe three or four shots that looked really nice (sad I can count them on one hand), otherwise the cinematography was pretty crappy as well. The lighting was way off in a lot of places. I think some of the effects were used to try and add to something that just had practically nothing going for it.<br /><br />I can't deny Johnny Rebel is pretty hot (without the blond hair of course).

{"value":"A well-intentioned movie about Sonja Horowitz (Renée Zellweger), the wife of devout Talmudic scholar Mendel (Glenn Fitzgerald). who is deeply unhappy. Mendel's brother Sender (Christopher Eccleston) sees this and hires her to work in the field in which she's already an expertjewelry. He also starts an affair with her, and then when she spends time with a Puerto Rican artist, he dumps her and betrays her to the family, which shuts her out. There's a subplot in which Sonja's dead brother talks to her, and apparently takes the form of a magical beggar woman, but why is not clear. Much is not clear, unfortunately, including what is going on with Sonja, why she tells the Rebbe there's a fire inside her and maybe it's not from god, and what this means, and what the magical beggar woman tells her means. To an extent the story touches on the plight of women in the ultra-orthodox community, and yet Sonja is not exactly liberated. Nor is the notion of being redeemed by the love of a man of another race very well-thought-out. The title comes from the biblical definition of the worth of a good womanand yet it's the bastard Sender who quotes it to Sonja. Zellweger struggles with the part; she's supposed to be a Jew from the mid-west and sometimes her accent is flat, and at other times it's taken on the characteristic sounds of Brooklyn. She's at her best when she's being tough and taking charge, but ultimately the movie's a mess.","finished_norm":["a","wellintent","movi","about","sonja","horowitz","rené","zellweg","the","wife","of","devout","talmud","scholar","mendel","glenn","fitzgerald","who","be","deepli","unhappi","mendel","brother","sender","christoph","eccleston","see","thi","and","hire","her","to","work","in","the","field","in","which","she","alreadi","a","expertjewelri","he","conjur","start","a","affair","with","her","and","then","when","she","spend","time","with","a","puerto","rican","artist","he","dump","her","and","betrai","her","to","the","famili","which","shut","her","out","there","a","subplot","in","which","sonja","dead","brother","talk","to","her","and","appar","take","the","form","of","a","magic","beggar","woman","but","why","be","not","clear","much","be","not","clear","unfortun","includ","what","be","go","on","with","sonja","why","she","tell","the","rebb","there","a","fire","insid","her","and","mayb","it","not","from","god","and","what","thi","mean","and","what","the","magic","beggar","woman","tell","her","mean","to","a","extent","the","stori","touch","on","the","plight","of","woman","in","the","ultraorthodox","commun","and","yet","sonja","be","not","exactli","liber","nor","be","the","notion","of","be","redeem","by","the","love","of","a","man","of","anoth","race","veri","wellthoughtout","the","titl","come","from","the","biblic","definit","of","the","worth","of","a","good","womanand","yet","it","the","bastard","sender","who","quot","it","to","sonja","zellweg","struggl","with","the","part","she","suppos","to","be","a","jew","from","the","midwest","and","sometim","her","accent","be","flat","and","at","other","time","it","take","on","the","characterist","sound","of","brooklyn","she","at","her","well","when","she","be","tough","and","take","charg","but","ultim","the","movi","a","mess"],"filtered":["wellintent","movi","sonja","horowitz","rené","zellweg","wife","devout","talmud","scholar","mendel","glenn","fitzgerald","deepli","unhappi","mendel","brother","sender","christoph","eccleston","see","thi","hire","work","field","alreadi","expertjewelri","conjur","start","affair","spend","time","puerto","rican","artist","dump","betrai","famili","shut","subplot","sonja","dead","brother","talk","appar","take","form","magic","beggar","woman","clear","much","clear","unfortun","includ","go","sonja","tell","rebb","fire","insid","mayb","god","thi","mean","magic","beggar","woman","tell","mean","extent","stori","touch","plight","woman","ultraorthodox","commun","yet","sonja","exactli","liber","notion","redeem","love","man","anoth","race","veri","wellthoughtout","titl","come","biblic","definit","worth","good","womanand","yet","bastard","sender","quot","sonja","zellweg","struggl","part","suppos","jew","midwest","sometim","accent","flat","time","take","characterist","sound","brooklyn","well","tough","take","charg","ultim","movi","mess"],"filtered2":["wellintent","sonja","horowitz","rené","zellweg","wife","devout","talmud","scholar","mendel","glenn","fitzgerald","deepli","unhappi","mendel","brother","sender","christoph","eccleston","see","hire","work","field","alreadi","expertjewelri","conjur","start","affair","spend","time","puerto","rican","artist","dump","betrai","famili","shut","subplot","sonja","dead","brother","talk","appar","take","form","magic","beggar","woman","clear","clear","unfortun","includ","go","sonja","tell","rebb","fire","insid","mayb","god","mean","magic","beggar","woman","tell","mean","extent","stori","touch","plight","woman","ultraorthodox","commun","yet","sonja","exactli","liber","notion","redeem","love","man","anoth","race","veri","wellthoughtout","titl","come","biblic","definit","worth","good","womanand","yet","bastard","sender","quot","sonja","zellweg","struggl","part","suppos","jew","midwest","sometim","accent","flat","time","take","characterist","sound","brooklyn","well","tough","take","charg","ultim","mess"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,8,15,17,20,31,34,39,45,48,54,61,70,71,73,88,90,149,163,178,182,186,194,219,227,228,263,264,283,301,308,330,352,381,392,407,462,500,551,559,590,593,634,689,724,735,745,842,890,1014,1022,1061,1109,1123,1162,1201,1282,1408,1522,1605,1699,1887,2165,2258,2353,2639,2727,3376,3379,3457,3633,3900,4199,4652,4813,4910,5599,5752,6208,6395,7781],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,8,15,17,20,31,34,39,45,48,54,61,70,71,73,88,90,149,163,178,182,186,194,219,227,228,263,264,283,301,308,330,352,381,392,407,462,500,551,559,590,593,634,689,724,735,745,842,890,1014,1022,1061,1109,1123,1162,1201,1282,1408,1522,1605,1699,1887,2165,2258,2353,2639,2727,3376,3379,3457,3633,3900,4199,4652,4813,4910,5599,5752,6208,6395,7781],"value

{"value":"What is happening to ITV Drama. First, \"Losing Gemma\" quite simply the worst TV drama I have seen in years, and now \"Perfect Parents\" a complete shambles from start to finish. Whoever is responsible for commissioning this drivel should be receiving there P45 by special delivery.<br /><br />In most Drama/Thrillers, a requirement to suspend certain levels of belief is necessary so that the the plot line can develop, but \"Perfect Parents\" took this to a new level,I suspended so much belief by the end of this nonsense I felt I had been force fed on a lorry load of \"Magic mushrooms\", it was like the scriptwriters had decided to try and create a \"Drama by numbers\" involving some serious issues - Religion, Education,Greed,Fear,Murder,Paedophillia the only trouble was as The great Eric Morecambe once said when playing a piano, \"I'm playing all the right Notes, just not necessarily in the correct order\". For your next Script guys, I suggest you try reading a few more books on script development than \"Script writing For Dummies\".<br /><br />Due to the ridiculous Script and the utter lack of Tension in the Direction, the acting was suitably low key, not the fault of the actors as the cast was top notch. But I suggest that all of the actors involved in this sorry piece of drama should instruct their agents the next time the Postman attempts to deliver a script from ITV drama Department, make sure the

{"value":"Cut to the chase, this is one of the five worst films that I've ever seen.<br /><br />Not that they didn't try. There was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there, a good cast, some good acting. I'm not sure where it went wrong, but it went horribly wrong.<br /><br />Some of the elements may have been bad structure and no substantive story, a lot of overacting by the lead (who probably is much better when restrained), some bad directing and editing. I had enough at about an hour, tearing my hair out at about a hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it ran. There was also an insincerity about it all, being that I went with someone who used to be a heroin addict. He was agitated that it glamorized something that had nothing good to it. That was bolstered by the pretty 17 year-old girl who was in love with the 30 year-old junkie.<br /><br />And the frantic nature of the lead was a turn-off enough. There were clunky plot points that were an attempt at a structure, but the end result was listless and unending (with uneven time lines). The characters were colorful but to no end, which made me feel bad for the quality actors who you've just not seen enough.<br /><br />Skip it. I assumed that this was a first-time director who was enamored by his own turds, but he has done this before. I'm puzzled how this and many other really bad ideas find someone who will actually give them money.","finished_norm":["cut","to","the","chase","thi","be","on","of","the","five","wrong","film","that","i","have","ever","seenbr","br","not","that","thei","do","not","try","there","be","some","decent","write","with","some","elem","of","structur","in","there","a","good","cast","some","good","act","i","be","not","sure","where","it","go","wrong","but","it","go","horribli","wrongbr","br","some","of","the","elem","mai","have","be","bad","structur","and","no","substant","stori","a","lot","of","overact","by","the","lead","who","probabl","be","much","well","when","restrain","some","bad","direct","and","edit","i","have","enough","at","about","a","hour","tear","my","hair","out","at","about","a","hour","and","a","half","and","veri","agit","at","the","hour","and","fifti","minut","it","run","there","be","conjur","a","insincer","about","it","all","be","that","i","go","with","someon","who","us","to","be","a","heroin","addict","he","be","agit","that","it","glamor","someth","that","have","noth","good","to","it","that","be","bolster","by","the","pretti","yearold","girl","who","be","in","love","with","the","yearold","junkiebr","br","and","the","frantic","natur","of","the","lead","be","a","turnoff","enough","there","be","clunki","plot","point","that","be","a","attempt","at","a","structur","but","the","end","result","be","listless","and","unend","with","uneven","time","line","the","charact","be","color","but","to","no","end","which","make","me","feel","bad","for","the","qualiti","actor","who","you","have","just","not","see","enoughbr","br","skip","it","i","assum","that","thi","be","a","firsttim","director","who","be","enamor","by","hi","own","turd","but","he","have","do","thi","befor","i","be","puzzl","how","thi","and","mani","other","realli","bad","idea","find","someon","who","will","actual","give","them","monei"],"filtered":["cut","chase","thi","five","wrong","film","ever","seenbr","br","thei","try","decent","write","elem","structur","good","cast","good","act","sure","go","wrong","go","horribli","wrongbr","br","elem","mai","bad","structur","substant","stori","lot","overact","lead","probabl","much","well","restrain","bad","direct","edit","enough","hour","tear","hair","hour","half","veri","agit","hour","fifti","minut","run","conjur","insincer","go","someon","us","heroin","addict","agit","glamor","someth","noth","good","bolster","pretti","yearold","girl","love","yearold","junkiebr","br","frantic","natur","lead","turnoff","enough","clunki","plot","point","attempt","structur","end","result","listless","unend","uneven","time","line","charact","color","end","make","feel","bad","qualiti","actor","see","enoughbr","br","skip","assum","thi","firsttim","director","enamor","hi","turd","thi","befor","puzzl","thi","mani","realli","bad","idea","find","someon","actual","give","monei"],"filtered2":["cut","chase","five","wrong","ever","seenbr","try","decent","write","elem","structur","good","cast","good","act","sure","go","wrong","go","horribli","wrongbr","elem","mai","bad","structur","substant","stori","lot","overact","lead","probabl","well","restrain","bad","direct","edit","enough","hour","tear","hair","hour","half","veri","agit","hour","fifti","minut","run","conjur","insincer","go","someon","us","heroin","addict","agit","glamor","someth","noth","good","bolster","pretti","yearold","girl","love","yearold","junkiebr","frantic","natur","lead","turnoff","enough","clunki","plot","point","attempt","structur","end","result","listless","unend","uneven","time","line","charact","color","end","make","feel","bad","qualiti","actor","see","enoughbr","skip","assum","firsttim","director","enamor","turd","befor","puzzl","mani","realli","bad","idea","find","someon","actual","give","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,8,9,10,13,15,17,20,21,24,25,30,32,36,38,39,41,43,44,46,49,50,52,53,54,56,58,59,65,66,72,78,79,84,92,93,102,107,119,123,126,137,139,148,157,174,177,206,303,309,319,348,447,456,479,504,530,813,875,920,931,1120,1276,1308,1415,1614,1645,2211,2800,2933,2973,2999,3075,3118,4038,4276,4855,5356,5403,5956,6627],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,8,9,10,13,15,17,20,21,24,25,30,32,36,38,39,41,43,44,46,49,50,52,53,54,56,58,59,65,66,72,78,79,84,92,93,102,107,119,123,126,137,139,148,157,174,177,206,303,309,319,348,447,456,479,504,530,813,875,920,931,1120,1276,1308,1415,1614,1645,2211,2800,2933,2973,2999,3075,3118,4038,4276,4855,5356,5403,5956,6627],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,2.912480743411154,0.9418936859054116,4.273428342688829,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.16201554533

{"value":"I have watched this movie a few times and never really thought it was that funny, but it's still fun to watch and good for a few laughs.<br /><br />Its about women that work at a company and their boss is a jerk and they end up giving him a taste of his own medicine, and try to get the respect they deserve.<br /><br />The acting is really good. Dabney Coleman is one of those 80's stars that plays a good bad guy, not really evil, just unlikeable. Dolly Partin is lovable and fun to watch in comedies and her down south wit really shines here. Jane Fonda is so-so and does little for me. Lily Tomlin is the best thing about this movie, she has the funniest lines and made me laugh out loud several times, gotta love her.<br /><br />I could recommend this to anyone that likes 80's comedy. I like the movie but it has things about it that I don't like. It starts off great and has a nice flow and then everything starts coming together all at once and made me care less about the characters. They all have little fantasies about what they would like to do the boss and although 'cute' I just thought it slowed down the flow of the movie. As the movie goes on it once again picks up and the funniest things happen and then once again it slows down, only to wrap up in a quick manner thats too good to be true.<br /><br />4 out of 10 stars, but give it a try if you haven't seen it.

{"value":"Given the history of the director of this movie, it is hard to believe that this was such a painfully bad movie to sit through. I was at the European premiere last night and one of the Executive Producers was there. He was yet to see the movie and, boy, was he in for a surprise. I have not read the book that this is based upon, nor do I know if it highly rated or appreciated, but I have read \"Captain Correlli's Mandolin\" and given how poorly that was adapted for screen and how bad this movie was, I can only presume that something similar has happened here. The acting wasn't bad albeit that there were a couple-too-many raised eyebrows from Farrell. Honestly, I can't believed how little I cared for any character in this movie. Situations play out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness. Donald Sutherland's part comprises a few scenes where he opens a door, says something and closes it again. I kept looking at my watch when I wasn't cringing at the dialogue on the screen. I have never walked out on a movie but I was tempted to start during this. I gave this movie a score of '2' for reasons which seem horrendously shallow to me but these are the best things that I can say about this movie. The first is that I really enjoyed the all-too-short earthquake scene and the second is that Salma Hayek got naked and looked beautiful. I can say little else positive about this movie.

{"value":"I registered for IMDb just to comment on this movie. <br /><br />I just got done sitting through this movie, and the only thing that impressed me, was that I somehow had the will power to not stop it.<br /><br />I've seen a pretty decent number of action movies and what not, but Princess Blade has some of the worst fights I've ever seen in a movie. Most of the sword fighting involves mindlessly swinging the swords back and fourth and hoping the opponent isn't doing the same. I've seen a good many student films with better action and stronger plots.<br /><br />So now we have a \"futuristic\" action movie with poor action, and virtually no sign of the future. <br /><br />Most of the movie doesn't even have any action and shows the developing relationship with the Princess and the farmboy/terrorist and his disturbed sister. The movie has multiple plot lines, and none of them really pan out to be worth anything. <br /><br />Part of the problem may have been that I watched the dub, which was quite bad. The entire cast mumbled all their lines so it was hard to follow what was going on. But I got the general idea. (Knowing exactly what was said would not have saved the movie in my eyes)<br /><br />If you've heard about this being a futuristic action/ninja flick, then you've heard wrong.

{"value":"If derivative and predictable rape-revenge thrillers are your thing, then you're in for a rare treat... They don't really appeal to me, so I couldn't find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale. It seems like something straight out of the 1980s, a different age when this would have gone straight to video. Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario. But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year? The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near-rape and by his work on documentaries, but even that's not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer. I don't think I was the only person in the cinema laughing. What I can't understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film - FilmFour and Verve Pictures. Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years. Verve distributed Bullet Boy, Code 46 and Red Road - Straightheads doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. FilmFour and Verve take note: is this really the best you can do? What are independent British filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement? It's a big blot on both of your reputations.

{"value":"This movie has a few things going for it right off the bat. Having Dani Filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie. Admittedly, I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before I watched it. Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead. The independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor. There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie. For being low budget, the special effects weren't bad either. The ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish.<br /><br />Now on to the cons. There is VERY little talking throughout this whole movie, thus making for very little as far as character development. It's hard to fear for the lives of limp, static characters. When there was a little talking, the F bomb was abundant, popping up in random places. Yes, I understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language. The storyline, what I could make out of it, was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what's happening.<br /><br />In the end, Cradle of Fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence, but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline, it just doesn't work too well. Rent it though, if you're a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","have","a","few","thing","go","for","it","right","off","the","bat","have","dani","filth","a","a","lead","actor","be","automat","go","to","make","some","peopl","like","thi","movi","admittedli","i","love","cradl","of","filth","and","listen","to","the","soundtrack","to","thi","movi","long","befor","i","watch","it","dani","filth","be","a","veri","recogniz","charact","and","make","for","a","great","lead","the","independ","film","styl","of","the","movi","be","great","for","the","creepi","factor","there","be","some","gorgeou","actress","in","thi","movi","for","be","low","budget","the","special","effect","be","not","bad","either","the","wai","that","peopl","die","be","veri","creativ","and","nightmarishbr","br","now","on","to","the","con","there","be","veri","littl","talk","throughout","thi","whole","movi","thu","make","for","veri","littl","a","far","a","charact","develop","it","hard","to","fear","for","the","live","of","limp","static","charact","when","there","be","a","littl","talk","the","f","bomb","be","abund","pop","up","in","random","place","ye","i","understand","peopl","swear","but","it","seem","like","a","preteen","boi","script","thi","and","think","himself","cool","for","includ","all","the","languag","the","storylin","what","i","can","make","out","of","it","be","pretti","good","although","mani","part","be","leav","dangl","and","the","lack","of","convers","leav","on","often","wonder","what","happeningbr","br","in","the","end","cradl","of","fear","be","like","a","porno","for","peopl","who","love","sex","and","violenc","but","like","a","porno","try","to","pull","of","a","storylin","it","just","doe","not","work","too","good","rend","it","though","if","you","re","a","morbid","person","look","to","sate","your","blood","and","flesh","appetit"],"filtered":["thi","movi","thing","go","right","bat","dani","filth","lead","actor","automat","go","make","peopl","like","thi","movi","admittedli","love","cradl","filth","listen","soundtrack","thi","movi","long","befor","watch","dani","filth","veri","recogniz","charact","make","great","lead","independ","film","styl","movi","great","creepi","factor","gorgeou","actress","thi","movi","low","budget","special","effect","bad","either","wai","peopl","die","veri","creativ","nightmarishbr","br","con","veri","littl","talk","throughout","thi","whole","movi","thu","make","veri","littl","far","charact","develop","hard","fear","live","limp","static","charact","littl","talk","f","bomb","abund","pop","random","place","ye","understand","peopl","swear","seem","like","preteen","boi","script","thi","think","cool","includ","languag","storylin","make","pretti","good","although","mani","part","leav","dangl","lack","convers","leav","often","wonder","happeningbr","br","end","cradl","fear","like","porno","peopl","love","sex","violenc","like","porno","try","pull","storylin","doe","work","good","rend","though","re","morbid","person","look","sate","blood","flesh","appetit"],"filtered2":["thing","go","right","bat","dani","filth","lead","actor","automat","go","make","peopl","like","admittedli","love","cradl","filth","listen","soundtrack","long","befor","watch","dani","filth","veri","recogniz","charact","make","great","lead","independ","styl","great","creepi","factor","gorgeou","actress","low","budget","special","effect","bad","either","wai","peopl","die","veri","creativ","nightmarishbr","con","veri","littl","talk","throughout","whole","thu","make","veri","littl","far","charact","develop","hard","fear","live","limp","static","charact","littl","talk","f","bomb","abund","pop","random","place","ye","understand","peopl","swear","seem","like","preteen","boi","script","think","cool","includ","languag","storylin","make","pretti","good","although","mani","part","leav","dangl","lack","convers","leav","often","wonder","happeningbr","end","cradl","fear","like","porno","peopl","love","sex","violenc","like","porno","try","pull","storylin","doe","work","good","rend","though","re","morbid","person","look","sate","blood","flesh","appetit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,7,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,23,24,29,33,35,36,41,48,50,51,54,61,68,74,77,78,79,86,99,101,106,111,116,121,153,157,164,171,175,183,186,203,207,209,212,217,237,254,256,282,293,301,320,354,355,380,400,438,453,481,515,533,544,755,796,812,845,859,952,1079,1094,1096,1125,1192,1211,1304,1344,1474,1572,1597,1867,2263,2279,2313,2419,2943,4031,4089,4091,4176,4420,4440,5748,5796,6167,7060,8579],"values":[4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,7,9,10,12,14,15,16,18,23,24,29,33,35,36,41,48,50,51,54,61,68,74,77,7

{"value":"Movie had some good acting and good moments (though obviously pretty low budget), but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed. The main point of conflict between the two leads doesn't play out in a realistic manner at all. There are a few scenes where they disagree because of it, but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently, especially since the employment of Glenn is so wound up in this part of his life (and Adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money.) Also, several times Glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is (apologizing to Adam for his past) while Adam is shown to be upstanding and \"traditional,\" which the film proclaims to be the \"good\" way in the end. I don't like being preached to like that. I attended a discussion session with the director after viewing LTR, and he said that he presented this conflict between them because, if he was in Glenn's shoes (and he said he does in real life relate to Glenn's view) that he could never date someone with Adam's views. Well, then, I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the film. Also, director said he directed this, his first movie, only after reading (Directing For Dummies.) Directing was not that bad, but far from a top notch effort. I've seen worse, but I rarely leave films feeling this

{"value":"First off, I agree with quite a bit that escapes Mr. Chomsky's mouth. His matter-of-fact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus. He comes across likable, unassuming, pragmatic. He doesn't cater to the current political style (obnoxious bi-partisanship) and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right, chastising both, and for good reason.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film itself is a dud. In fact, I would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches. Watching \"Rebel Without a Pause\" is no different from watching a speaker on a 3am taped segment on CSPAN. There are no camera movements, no edits, no stylistic touches. There is no story, no narrative.<br /><br />Technically speaking, the production is strictly amateurish. Audio is terrible and inconsistent; sometimes we cannot hear Noam speak, other times we cannot hear the questions that are being posited by those in attendance. When Noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride

{"value":"Imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater only because you are in Washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the Museums. You think you might go see the Sarah Marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain. It's sold out. Options? - The Bank Job, In Bruges, The Leatherheads or Prom night. You've seen the Bank Job (suprisingly decent heist movie that) and In Bruges (again, pretty good) so you're down to two. You don't fancy watching Clooney or the nice one from the Office run around in 1930 football uniforms, so you go see Prom Night right? Wrong. You take the $8.50, walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $8.50. It would be money better spent.<br /><br />It actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. If I was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut I wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry. Probably both. An insult to anyone's intelligence... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie, as for the acting, they might as well have cast robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles, they would have been more realistic.

{"value":"How can you tell that a horror movie is terrible? when you can't stop laughing about it of course! The plot has been well covered by other reviewers, so I'll just add a few things on the hilarity of it all.<br /><br />Some reviews have placed the location in South America, others in Africa, I thought it was in some random island in the Pacific. Where exactly does this take place, seems to be a mystery. The cannibal tribe is conformed by a couple of black women some black men, and a man who looks like a young Frank Zappa banging the drums... the Devil God is a large black man with a terrible case of pink eyes.<br /><br />One of the \"freakiest\" moments in the film is when, \"Pablito\" find his partner hanging from a tree covered in what seems to be an orange substance that I assume is blood, starts screaming for minutes on and on (that's actually funny), and then the head of his partner falls in the ground and \"Pablito\" kicks it a bit for what I assume is \"shits n' giggles\" and the eyes actually move...<br /><br />But, of course, then the \"freak\" is gone when you realize the eyes moved because the movie is just bad...<br /><br />I hadn't laughed like this in a loooong while, and I definitely recommend this film for a Sunday afternoon with your friends and you have nothing to do... grab a case of beers and start watching this film, you'll love it! If you are looking for a real horror or gore movie, though... don't' bother.","finished_norm":["how","can","you","tell","that","a","horror","movi","be","terribl","when","you","ca","not","stop","laugh","about","it","of","cours","the","plot","have","be","good","cover","by","other","review","so","i","will","just","add","a","few","thing","on","the","hilar","of","it","allbr","br","some","review","have","place","the","locat","in","south","america","other","in","africa","i","think","it","be","in","some","random","island","in","the","pacif","where","exactli","doe","thi","take","place","seem","to","be","a","mysteri","the","cannib","tribe","be","conform","by","a","coupl","of","black","woman","some","black","man","and","a","man","who","look","like","a","young","frank","zappa","bang","the","drum","the","devil","god","be","a","larg","black","man","with","a","terribl","case","of","pink","eyesbr","br","on","of","the","freaki","moment","in","the","film","be","when","pablito","find","hi","partner","hang","from","a","tree","cover","in","what","seem","to","be","a","orang","substanc","that","i","assum","be","blood","start","scream","for","minut","on","and","on","that","actual","funni","and","then","the","head","of","hi","partner","fall","in","the","grind","and","pablito","kick","it","a","bite","for","what","i","assum","be","shit","n","giggl","and","the","ey","actual","movebr","br","but","of","cours","then","the","freak","be","go","when","you","realiz","the","ey","move","becaus","the","movi","be","just","badbr","br","i","have","not","laugh","like","thi","in","a","loooong","while","and","i","definit","recommend","thi","film","for","a","sundai","afternoon","with","your","friend","and","you","have","noth","to","do","grab","a","case","of","beer","and","start","watch","thi","film","you","will","love","it","if","you","be","look","for","a","real","horror","or","gore","movi","though","do","not","bother"],"filtered":["tell","horror","movi","terribl","ca","stop","laugh","cours","plot","good","cover","review","add","thing","hilar","allbr","br","review","place","locat","south","america","africa","think","random","island","pacif","exactli","doe","thi","take","place","seem","mysteri","cannib","tribe","conform","coupl","black","woman","black","man","man","look","like","young","frank","zappa","bang","drum","devil","god","larg","black","man","terribl","case","pink","eyesbr","br","freaki","moment","film","pablito","find","hi","partner","hang","tree","cover","seem","orang","substanc","assum","blood","start","scream","minut","actual","funni","head","hi","partner","fall","grind","pablito","kick","bite","assum","shit","n","giggl","ey","actual","movebr","br","cours","freak","go","realiz","ey","move","becaus","movi","badbr","br","laugh","like","thi","loooong","definit","recommend","thi","film","sundai","afternoon","friend","noth","grab","case","beer","start","watch","thi","film","love","look","real","horror","gore","movi","though","bother"],"filtered2":["tell","horror","terribl","ca","stop","laugh","cours","plot","good","cover","review","add","thing","hilar","allbr","review","place","locat","south","america","africa","think","random","island","pacif","exactli","doe","take","place","seem","mysteri","cannib","tribe","conform","coupl","black","woman","black","man","man","look","like","young","frank","zappa","bang","drum","devil","god","larg","black","man","terribl","case","pink","eyesbr","freaki","moment","pablito","find","partner","hang","tree","cover","seem","orang","substanc","assum","blood","start","scream","minut","actual","funni","head","partner","fall","grind","pablito","kick","bite","assum","shit","n","giggl","ey","actual","movebr","cours","freak","go","realiz","ey","move","becaus","badbr","laugh","like","loooong","definit","recommend","sundai","afternoon","friend","noth","grab","case","beer","start","watch","love","look","real","horror","gore","though","bother"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,7,12,16,18,22,29,31,32,35,38,45,49,52,54,59,62,70,71,80,81,83,86,90,133,135,154,161,164,166,169,176,188,199,208,229,253,275,281,288,298,299,315,352,354,358,392,403,405,462,491,496,526,564,719,775,808,848,859,869,920,1064,1299,1313,1353,1411,1425,1434,1435,1514,1550,1629,1729,2035,2345,2411,2413,2430,2730,2891,3071,3245,3419,4293,4376,4429,4430,6718,6950],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,7,12,16,18,22,29,31,32,35,38,45,49,52,54,59,62,70,71,80,81,83,86,90,133,135,154,161,164,166,169,176,188,199,208,229,253,275,281,288,298,299,315,352,354,358,392,403,405,462,491,496,526,564,719,775,808,848,859,869,920,1064,1299,1313,1353,1411,1425,1434,1435,1514,1550,1629,1729,2035,2345,2411,2413,2430,2730,2891,3071,3245,3419,4293,4376,4

{"value":"Before the Internet this movie could never have been made but the idea that the Web is full of evil is the idea behind it.Unfortunately thats all it was-the generally opinion that nowadays the Web in the wring hands can create as much chaos as anything in real life. Since the late 90s somebody found out that you could create a virus which would disable a computer.The point? Just to do something plain evil by remote control so its the cyber equivalent of robbery with violence.Which is basically what spam is without the violence-its conning you into parting with your money and has been going so long its a wonder anybody takes any notice of it nowadays so they get cleverer and use real names as doing something illegal isn't a priority, We see the Internet get worse by the week-the social networking sites or chat room which lead to evil and the child porn sites which ARE illegal. So the idea of a movie which invites people to click a name is just the same old thing-there actually IS a site called Horrorvision which is a porn site-but this one KILLS the people who enter its portals. The story though is so disjointed its boring with it and comes to no conclusion. The definitive movie on this theme of destroying an Internet Service Provider has yet to be made but clearly many DO need destroying as they won't be shut down when there's money to be made.

{"value":"Thank you Hollywood. Yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect-heavy and redundant remake. The original \"Planet of the Apes\" was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting. <br /><br />This movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues. Instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. Dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on. Instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations. <br /><br />The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The make-up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. However, this does not distract from the fact that \"Planet of the Apes (2001)\" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly non-existent plot.

{"value":"Quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well. What is it? What is it about Will Smith that I just can't stand any longer? I guess he just seems too hellbent on being taken seriously and obtaining an Oscar. I understand how bias this is, but unless he undergoes some new acting lessons I can't ever see him winning one. He's a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor. He's just not. I give him credit for trying so hard, and being able to cry at the drop of a hat. That's about it.<br /><br />Seven pounds was kind of an eyeroller for me, right from the start. The suicide 911 call didn't intrigue me in any way. I wasn't curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide. There were absolutely no surprises. The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had some decent on screen chemistry. Also, I don't know her name, but the hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife. Woody Harrelson had very limited screen time, but I'd say he stole the show whenever he was on.<br /><br />All in all, just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot. I couldn't help asking myself the whole way through why I cared about any of these people. Never once felt sorry for 'Tim/Ben'. He killed himself with a jellyfish?

{"value":"OK, this has got 2 be one of the worst excuses 4 a movie that i have ever had the misfortune of watching. Like all other Olsen twins movies with the possible exception of new york minute , this film had no story, gaping plot holes,disgustingly putrid acting and bad filming even!!!!!!!!! in case you haven't guessed yet I HATE MARY KATE AND ASHLEY!!!!!! The only reason i watched this was because i was really bored and nothing else was on. I wonder if the twins will EVER stop making the same stereotypical movies where they have an unbelievably stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day meanwhile getting the help of two cute guys who drool over them immediately. The least they could would be to have a guy 4 1 of them or have them both falling 4 the same guy. The plot in this story was so imbecilic and just plain dumb. even a toddler could see the flaws in it.Maybe they should split up and start making films individually or maybe films with a different kind of story. Anyone who liked this movie was no offense-either really stupid, really artificial or has not seen any really good movie. or maybe they are really smart and just have bad cinematic choices. either way i would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good movie experience.. the only thing it is good 4 is some rib splitting laughter at the pathetic attempts to be cool. if you watch for laughs it's hilarious. basically i give it 0 or less.","finished_norm":["okai","thi","have","get","be","on","of","the","wrong","excus","a","movi","that","i","have","ever","have","the","misfortun","of","watch","like","all","other","olsen","twin","movi","with","the","possibl","except","of","new","york","minut","thi","film","have","no","stori","gape","plot","holesdisgustingli","putrid","act","and","bad","film","even","in","case","you","have","not","guess","yet","i","hate","mari","kate","and","ashlei","the","onli","reason","i","watch","thi","be","becaus","i","be","realli","bore","and","noth","els","be","on","i","wonder","if","the","twin","will","ever","stop","make","the","same","stereotyp","movi","where","thei","have","a","unbeliev","stupid","adventur","in","a","exot","locat","and","save","the","dai","meanwhil","get","the","help","of","two","cute","gui","who","drool","over","them","immedi","the","littl","thei","can","would","be","to","have","a","gui","of","them","or","have","them","both","fall","the","same","gui","the","plot","in","thi","stori","be","so","imbecil","and","just","plain","dumb","even","a","toddler","can","see","the","flaw","in","itmayb","thei","should","split","up","and","start","make","film","individu","or","mayb","film","with","a","differ","kind","of","stori","anyon","who","like","thi","movi","be","no","offenseeith","realli","stupid","realli","artifici","or","have","not","see","ani","realli","good","movi","or","mayb","thei","be","realli","smart","and","just","have","bad","cinemat","choic","either","wai","i","would","not","recommend","thi","movi","to","my","wrong","nemesi","for","a","good","movi","experi","the","onli","thing","it","be","good","be","some","rib","split","laughter","at","the","pathet","attempt","to","be","cool","if","you","watch","for","laugh","it","hilari","basic","i","give","it","or","littl"],"filtered":["okai","thi","get","wrong","excus","movi","ever","misfortun","watch","like","olsen","twin","movi","possibl","except","new","york","minut","thi","film","stori","gape","plot","holesdisgustingli","putrid","act","bad","film","even","case","guess","yet","hate","mari","kate","ashlei","onli","reason","watch","thi","becaus","realli","bore","noth","els","wonder","twin","ever","stop","make","stereotyp","movi","thei","unbeliev","stupid","adventur","exot","locat","save","dai","meanwhil","get","help","two","cute","gui","drool","immedi","littl","thei","gui","fall","gui","plot","thi","stori","imbecil","plain","dumb","even","toddler","see","flaw","itmayb","thei","split","start","make","film","individu","mayb","film","differ","kind","stori","anyon","like","thi","movi","offenseeith","realli","stupid","realli","artifici","see","ani","realli","good","movi","mayb","thei","realli","smart","bad","cinemat","choic","either","wai","recommend","thi","movi","wrong","nemesi","good","movi","experi","onli","thing","good","rib","split","laughter","pathet","attempt","cool","watch","laugh","hilari","basic","give","littl"],"filtered2":["okai","get","wrong","excus","ever","misfortun","watch","like","olsen","twin","possibl","except","new","york","minut","stori","gape","plot","holesdisgustingli","putrid","act","bad","even","case","guess","yet","hate","mari","kate","ashlei","onli","reason","watch","becaus","realli","bore","noth","els","wonder","twin","ever","stop","make","stereotyp","unbeliev","stupid","adventur","exot","locat","save","dai","meanwhil","get","help","two","cute","gui","drool","immedi","littl","gui","fall","gui","plot","stori","imbecil","plain","dumb","even","toddler","see","flaw","itmayb","split","start","make","individu","mayb","differ","kind","stori","anyon","like","offenseeith","realli","stupid","realli","artifici","see","ani","realli","good","mayb","realli","smart","bad","cinemat","choic","either","wai","recommend","wrong","nemesi","good","experi","onli","thing","good","rib","split","laughter","pathet","attempt","cool","watch","laugh","hilari","basic","give","littl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,9,11,13,14,17,21,22,25,27,29,30,32,33,44,47,49,55,59,71,87,95,108,122,132,133,136,158,163,169,175,177,185,189,191,194,196,204,207,232,243,286,288,298,315,333,339,402,420,481,571,586,602,604,617,632,775,809,827,855,921,923,988,1076,1093,1119,1537,1594,1718,1728,1733,2226,2631,3051,3698,3823,4080,5042,5634,5864,6086,6335,6592,7608],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,9,11,13,14,17,21,22,25,27,29,30,32,33,44,47,49,55,59,71,87,95,108,122,132,133,136,158,163,169,175,177,185,189,191,194,196,204,207,232,243,286,288,298,315,333,339,402,420,481,571,586,602,604,617,632,775,809,827,855,921,923,988,1076,1093,1119,1537,1594,1718,1728,1733,2226,2631,30

{"value":"This is just a butchering of a wonderful story by Edwin Torres. This movie doesn't follow the storyline in the book. And, there are so many inconsistencies with the original movie that you have to wonder if the screenwriter had even seen the first movie.<br /><br />Al Pacino (the original and still the best Carlito) gets out of prison at the start of the original one. Here, Carlito retires with his woman in paradise. <br /><br />What happened to Gail from Lorain, Ohio? In this installment, she isn't mentioned, and Carlito retires with and presumably will marry some other girl.<br /><br />Also, where is Kleinfeld? I think he was in the first book.<br /><br />I also like how Mr. Guzman plays a totally different character in this film. He was Pachanga back in the Pacino days. Now, he is Nacho Reyes, a killer from Cuba. I remember that Nacho Reyes had a much bigger role in the book. <br /><br />It's been a while since I read the book, but where did Sean Comb's character come from? Also, I think this movie really glosses over the racial tensions in Harlem that Torres was writing about. And, the mob doesn't get the treatment that they did in the book. They are also wiped out in this movie. But, magically the Pleasant Avenue bunch is around for the second movie.<br /><br />The book told a great story. This movie could have told a great story.
