{"value":"With a Bo Derek movie, the audience get just what they expect. A paper thin plot and a few shots of Mrs. Derek in no clothes. 'Ghosts can't do it' is just that. The first fifteen minutes is ordinary TV drama, as long as Scott [Anthony Quinn] is still alive. He is a very good actor with long experience in a lot of different roles, but it seems as even a famous actor need to work just for money sometimes. Bo Derek is the opposite, always playing a strikingly handsome young woman with or without clothes. The movie is a complete waste of time. If you want to see Quinn, rent Lawrence of Arabia or La Strada. If you want to see nude women or bad acting, rent any porno movie.","finished_norm":["with","a","bo","derek","movi","the","audienc","get","just","what","thei","expect","a","paper","thin","plot","and","a","few","shot","of","mr","derek","in","no","cloth","ghost","ca","not","do","it","be","just","that","the","fifteen","minut","be","ordinari","tv","drama","a","long","a","scott","anthoni","quinn","be","still","aliv","he","be","a","veri","good","actor","with","long","experi","in","a","lot","of","differ","role","but","it","seem","a","even","a","famou","actor","ne","to","work","just","for","monei","sometim","bo","derek","be","the","opposit","alwai","plai","a","strikingli","handsom","young","woman","with","or","without","cloth","the","movi","be","a","complet","wast","of","time","if","you","want","to","see","quinn","rend","lawrenc","of","arabia","or","la","strada","if","you","want","to","see","nude","woman","or","bad","act","rend","ani","porno","movi"],"filtered":["bo","derek","movi","audienc","get","thei","expect","paper","thin","plot","shot","mr","derek","cloth","ghost","ca","fifteen","minut","ordinari","tv","drama","long","scott","anthoni","quinn","still","aliv","veri","good","actor","long","experi","lot","differ","role","seem","even","famou","actor","ne","work","monei","sometim","bo","derek","opposit","alwai","plai","strikingli","handsom","young","woman","without","cloth","movi","complet","wast","time","want","see","quinn","rend","lawrenc","arabia","la","strada","want","see","nude","woman","bad","act","rend","ani","porno","movi"],"filtered2":["bo","derek","audienc","get","expect","paper","thin","plot","shot","mr","derek","cloth","ghost","ca","fifteen","minut","ordinari","tv","drama","long","scott","anthoni","quinn","still","aliv","veri","good","actor","long","experi","lot","differ","role","seem","even","famou","actor","ne","work","monei","sometim","bo","derek","opposit","alwai","plai","strikingli","handsom","young","woman","without","cloth","complet","wast","time","want","see","quinn","rend","lawrenc","arabia","la","strada","want","see","nude","woman","bad","act","rend","ani","porno"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,8,9,15,21,27,32,35,37,40,41,48,59,64,70,72,81,89,99,103,110,125,126,128,130,135,168,172,197,204,333,357,441,463,500,531,727,766,865,879,930,980,1048,1399,1652,1678,1710,1867,1948,1959,2282,2315,2521,2942,3820,7890],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,8,9,15,21,27,32,35,37,40,41,48,59,64,70,72,81,89,99,103,110,125,126,128,130,135,168,172,197,204,333,357,441,463,500,531,727,766,865,879,930,980,1048,1399,1652,1678,1710,1867,1948,1959,2282,2315,2521,2942,3820,7890],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,2.975308642954861,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,1.6955116224012472,1.8693254449200722,1.883428577602134,4.189351572503368,1.9209463754160525,1.949757232424728,1.9940046109572438,4.112860414513218,2.098582041218749,2.1290479736304078,2.2242236634876535,2.2391270689902285,2.3409902041158843,2.2642139034199635,2.366244071437088,2.4894767118610357,2.5001408943598484,2.558331832813986,2.624524614047584,2.948928684455311,3.2829611516442836,3.293679367864308,3.3467891931782563,3.3814747511661465,6.849501469295936,4.096025840389245,3.9825254665248626,3.9201351739255808,7.792459306144053,4.3095999406873045,4.081705786614497,4.160564361526816,4.436351646326448,4.646072177308517,10.712052952369687,4.85885294158718,4.8184434032493035,16.50521486209871,4.911775343041523,5.116075806554253,5.214056214914456,5.214056214914456,5.672363804397,12.064733076856815,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.803501592058164E-5,5.764367224075E-5,5.8091796826347434E-5,0.18062738145551857,5.775708807476949E-5,5.767635520771252E-5,5.784789276930548E-5,5.765197255289764E-5,5.778159520383324E-5,6.410552570565134E-5,0.6020581347613243,5.755890955834133E-5,5.8633218061952934E-5,5.946963380143718E-5,5.7600880914742496E-5,5.744169693233418E-5,5.887450820864406E-5,5.785331268020376E-5,5.767382300298417E-5,5.772162434802252E-5,5.828011491800299E-5,5.791063067343283E-5,5.7976570711869455E-5,5.8039033964210714E-5,5.848445373251251E-5,5.817859650412525E-5,6.0624314178070076E-5,5.757602129439747E-5,5.7577561587803083E-5,5.7723434014483765E-5,5.895033209125946E-5,5.784996057475859E-5,0.03401473050063978,5.8012683977133916E-5,5.763869020431475E-5,5.7904730755423444E-5,5.758093479634968E-5,5.761496089231505E-5,5.7441408340604434E-5,5.745631129203339E-5,5.758563846591373E-5,5.819304493128503E-5,5.7897341615430854E-5,5.766843171125001E-5,5.836916362558519E-5,5.769056517046847E-5,5.9607336170912403E-5,5.873079291797733E-5,5.747

{"value":"I thought that Zombie Flesh Eaters 2 was quite a good horror film When a terrorist's body, infected with a stolen chemical, is recovered by the US military, the corpse is then cremated, releasing the virus into the atmosphere over a small island. Soon the infected locals turn into flesh-hungry zombies, and a group of soldiers on leave must team up with a group of tourists and board themselves up in a abandoned hotel as they try to fight off the aggressive living dead. I did not find this film to be as good as the original film, Zombie Flesh Eaters. But it was still an OK horror film with some good action. I did not think that it was one of the best in the series.

{"value":"Production line collection of fart jokes that pretends 'Babe' was never made; the writers clearly hoped that the gimmick of seeing animals talk would be enough to keep the movie going. It's not. Eddie Murphy sells out yet again as a doctor who rediscovers his forgotten childhood gift for understanding the incessant and witless chatter of guinea pigs, tigers, rats, dogs and pigeons. The voice cast is impressive (Albert Brooks, Julie Kavner, Reni Santoni, John Leguizamo, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Paul Reubens, Brian Doyle-Murray) but the script is so unimaginative, charmless and depressingly unfunny that the whole thing rattles down the bin chute pretty

{"value":"As others have noted, this should have been an excellent Hammer-style film, and it seems to me that that's how most of the actors were instructed to play it... but the screenplay is so leaden, poorly paced, and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies (poor Timothy Dalton is saddled with most of them) that it's all too overblown and self-important. This is an uncharacteristically weak performance from Dalton, although he quietly nails the climactic scene where Dr. Rock finally realizes what he's done. The only actor who comes off really well is Patrick Stewart who is a most welcome sight. Freddie Francis may have been a great cinematographer, but he was a lousy director.","finished_norm":["a","other","have","note","thi","should","have","be","a","excel","hammerstyl","film","and","it","seem","to","me","that","that","how","much","of","the","actor","be","instruct","to","plai","it","but","the","screenplai","be","so","leaden","poorli","pace","and","fill","with","a","lot","of","dull","soliloqui","poor","timothi","dalton","be","saddl","with","much","of","them","that","it","all","too","overblown","and","selfimport","thi","be","a","uncharacterist","weak","perform","from","dalton","although","he","quietli","nail","the","climact","scene","where","dr","rock","final","realiz","what","he","do","the","onli","actor","who","come","off","realli","good","be","patrick","stewart","who","be","a","much","welcom","sight","freddi","franci","mai","have","be","a","great","cinematograph","but","he","be","a","lousi","director"],"filtered":["note","thi","excel","hammerstyl","film","seem","much","actor","instruct","plai","screenplai","leaden","poorli","pace","fill","lot","dull","soliloqui","poor","timothi","dalton","saddl","much","overblown","selfimport","thi","uncharacterist","weak","perform","dalton","although","quietli","nail","climact","scene","dr","rock","final","realiz","onli","actor","come","realli","good","patrick","stewart","much","welcom","sight","freddi","franci","mai","great","cinematograph","lousi","director"],"filtered2":["note","excel","hammerstyl","seem","actor","instruct","plai","screenplai","leaden","poorli","pace","fill","lot","dull","soliloqui","poor","timothi","dalton","saddl","overblown","selfimport","uncharacterist","weak","perform","dalton","although","quietli","nail","climact","scene","dr","rock","final","realiz","onli","actor","come","realli","good","patrick","stewart","welcom","sight","freddi","franci","mai","great","cinematograph","lousi","director"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,11,13,19,34,35,40,41,46,51,58,72,105,146,156,237,367,379,398,405,546,553,560,580,582,703,739,1117,1136,1280,2012,2265,2471,2505,3102,3351,3689,3696,4018,4442,4511,4736,5939,6055,7923,8235],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,11,13,19,34,35,40,41,46,51,58,72,105,146,156,237,367,379,398,405,546,553,560,580,582,703,739,1117,1136,1280,2012,2265,2471,2505,3102,3351,3689,3696,4018,4442,4511,4736,5939,6055,7923,8235],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,1.865701314626681,1.9209463754160525,2.1765612129984904,2.326138445979858,2.3451551414151686,2.640097787510554,3.0791938792932125,3.1272886331425473,3.143848349181566,3.109204957709252,3.4572130107926293,3.454678155189441,3.4623020803001006,3.5039747767006686,3.7099788181381825,3.6746621462132825,4.004218291136122,4.224077767249142,5.0768550934009715,4.364659717870332,4.8796870284900224,5.051537285416681,5.583416318380505,5.339219357868463,5.482320201509136,5.878215858601149,5.7959777603641776,5.7959777603641776,5.850044981634453,5.999576715605417,5.999576715605417,6.032366538428407,13.200701152068694,6.389041482367141,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.796019892590971E-5,6.750192741675478E-5,6.802669053601485E-5,6.763363159338514E-5,6.763473969429184E-5,6.754019984420273E-5,6.774107386179715E-5,6.751164725323198E-5,6.766343804717168E-5,0.1831366101585166,0.28011650392162807,6.740266856989118E-5,6.866070595396207E-5,6.964016601162619E-5,6.745181789267446E-5,6.726541017073825E-5,0.03290210545327381,6.774742068908693E-5,0.1960172499436233,6.759321093986406E-5,6.824721489992254E-5,6.781454123967336E-5,6.789175838277654E-5,6.796490413775455E-5,6.84864998602533E-5,6.812833474640943E-5,7.099232051433542E-5,6.742270676524438E-5,6.742451048054608E-5,6.759533009656187E-5,6.903205301352625E-5,6.774349530457104E-5,7.27169035413812E-5,6.793404776018614E-5,6.74960933494796E-5,6.780763231417029E-5,6.742846057722838E-5,0.01779246028840456,6.726507222387891E-5,6.728252388694179E-5,6.743396867116414E-5,6.814525415219178E-5,6.779897947905304E-5,6.753092126665366E-5,6.835149277053885E-5,6.75568400032568E-5,6.980141832238478E-5,6.877496812000781E-5,6.7299247272325E-5,6.744798272442826E-5,6.742458922290518E-5,6.932217061551388E-5,6.744898622182736E-5,6.72765507363001E-5,6.801500716079266E-5,6.746635929014755E-5,0.16710812050325521,6.741075824368468E-5,6.729846899513864E-5,6.761979943249015E-5,6.829053101250267E-5,6.761532599812991E-5,6.728601862792046E-5,6.744268381695011E-5,6.726588580683447E-5,6.882227898298649E-5,0.05690106049674152,6.770082930848166E-5,0.06113452625339392,6.788818633745508E-5,6.726343184063997E-5,6.76430399483963E-5,6.874016515189221E-5,6.738397164670713E-5,6.905168983568681E-5,6.756212802188E-5,6.80909031135378E-5,6.76747614679

{"value":"I am a huge Charlton Heston fan. He is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time, but what was he thinking when he made this movie. Normally if he made a bad movie I could blame it on the screenwriter or director, but in this case it's all him. The suckiness of this movie is all his fault. It proves that not even Heston can make a Shakespeare story interesting. I wasted 2 and a half hours of my life on this snooze fest and I'll never get that time back. This is by far THE WORST Heston movie that I've ever seen. If you are a Shakespeare fan maybe you'll find this movie entertaining, but if you're not don't waste your time, you'll regret it in the long run.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","huge","charlton","heston","fan","he","be","without","a","doubt","on","of","the","great","actor","of","all","time","but","what","be","he","think","when","he","make","thi","movi","normal","if","he","make","a","bad","movi","i","can","blame","it","on","the","screenwrit","or","director","but","in","thi","case","it","all","him","the","sucki","of","thi","movi","be","all","hi","fault","it","prove","that","not","even","heston","can","make","a","shakespear","stori","interest","i","wast","and","a","half","hour","of","my","life","on","thi","snooz","fest","and","i","will","never","get","that","time","back","thi","be","by","far","the","wrong","heston","movi","that","i","have","ever","see","if","you","be","a","shakespear","fan","mayb","you","will","find","thi","movi","entertain","but","if","you","re","not","do","not","wast","your","time","you","will","regret","it","in","the","long","run"],"filtered":["huge","charlton","heston","fan","without","doubt","great","actor","time","think","make","thi","movi","normal","make","bad","movi","blame","screenwrit","director","thi","case","sucki","thi","movi","hi","fault","prove","even","heston","make","shakespear","stori","interest","wast","half","hour","life","thi","snooz","fest","never","get","time","back","thi","far","wrong","heston","movi","ever","see","shakespear","fan","mayb","find","thi","movi","entertain","re","wast","time","regret","long","run"],"filtered2":["huge","charlton","heston","fan","without","doubt","great","actor","time","think","make","normal","make","bad","blame","screenwrit","director","case","sucki","fault","prove","even","heston","make","shakespear","stori","interest","wast","half","hour","life","snooz","fest","never","get","time","back","far","wrong","heston","ever","see","shakespear","fan","mayb","find","entertain","re","wast","time","regret","long","run"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,8,9,12,17,25,38,41,42,44,51,58,60,63,68,75,89,99,101,125,137,140,163,174,195,206,288,444,540,567,700,898,1298,1503,1677,1837,2807,2832,4867,6835],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,8,9,12,17,25,38,41,42,44,51,58,60,63,68,75,89,99,101,125,137,140,163,174,195,206,288,444,540,567,700,898,1298,1503,1677,1837,2807,2832,4867,6835],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,2.825681057716235,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,1.2796387880827016,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.7139899308309823,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,1.8729627573220065,2.0064197866819473,1.9742250248702675,3.9880092219144876,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.2242236634876535,2.2939035841256437,4.634339551994196,2.4000574358028657,2.456282578459816,2.51289241584188,2.597304642813496,2.8015621426949333,3.2535472664379905,3.432149042129413,3.454678155189441,3.616452760127359,3.892300374932137,4.3521595551061,4.605250182788262,4.679973728984199,10.128232135247083,17.63464757580345,5.3560264761848435,6.214688095222362,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.977089163305956E-5,8.91655455240566E-5,0.043213268958285415,8.933951796019965E-5,8.934098168761636E-5,8.921610084895655E-5,8.94814420332139E-5,8.917838477998694E-5,8.93788902983494E-5,9.916099978463941E-5,0.6745737775616574,8.903443120528998E-5,0.2752889737987494,9.199001614391298E-5,8.909935418372663E-5,8.88531220115144E-5,9.106945199395564E-5,8.948982576889816E-5,8.921218393306267E-5,8.928612497188696E-5,9.015002059835514E-5,8.95784875410571E-5,8.968048623875497E-5,8.977710690419339E-5,9.04661000769731E-5,8.999298784172681E-5,9.377612208904415E-5,8.906090032533385E-5,8.906328291298728E-5,8.928892423659306E-5,9.118673941847845E-5,8.948464059767201E-5,9.605418128369017E-5,8.973634768672991E-5,8.915783911016411E-5,8.956936131111018E-5,8.906850072733761E-5,8.912113365808037E-5,8.885267560624534E-5,8.887572808958699E-5,8.907577655218255E-5,9.001533724868835E-5,8.955793149283557E-5,8.920384446664997E-5,9.028776471286294E-5,8.923808138960842E-5,9.220301969516027E-5,9.084714741490441E-5,8.889781856667065E-5,8.90942881821777E-5,8.90633869263936E-5,9.156996542753218E-5,8.909561373533515E-5,8.88678379558405E-5,8.984328965708007E-5,8.911856240026191E-5,9.58372194781338E-5,8.90451171250039E-5,8.889679051439798E-5,8.93212465978967E-5,9.020723829503428E-5,8.93153374893666E-5,8.888034440941299E-5,8.908728867869606E-5,8.885375029508516E-5,9.090964191051581E-5,8.961918364409668E-5,8.942828166153158E-5,8.935007258746472E-5,8.967576780504628E-5,8.885050876935689E-5,8.93519457698809E-5,9.08011750144613E-5,8.90097338163542E-5,9.121267835129581E-5,8.924506650963867E-5,8.994354315040341E-5,8.939384778218452E-5,8.882265151800428E-5,8.893275329495225E-5]}}
{"value":"Have I ever seen a film more shockingly inept? I can think of plenty that equal this one, but none which manage to outdo it. The cast are all horrible stereotypes lumbered with flat dialogue. I am ashamed for all of the people involved in making this. Each one wears an expression of fear not generated by the plot, but by the realisation that this project could easily nix their career. Even the many charms of Ms. Diaz don't provide an adequate reason to subject yourself to this. Avoid, it's obviously a style of film that Americans haven't really got a grasp of. Watch the final result if you must, and you'll see what I'm talking about, but DON'T say I didn't warn

{"value":"i should love this movie . the acting is very good and Barbara Stanwyck is great but the the movie has always seemed very trite to me . the movie makes working class people look low and cheap .the fact that the daughter is ashamed of her mother and that the daughter does not rise above it has always made me a bit uneasy .

{"value":"On Steve Irwin's show, he's hillarious. He doesn't even try to be funny and he just is but his movie wasn't even what I would call a movie-I mean when that guy on his car is trying to kill him he's just saying 'Oh, this is one nasty bloke!' and looking straight into the camera. He put his face in the camera too much! And then when the guy falls off the car wouldn't you expect him to be dead? And Terri had the worst acting I'd ever seen! Like when the crocodile almost ate Steve she just says 'Steve'. She didn't sound scared or anything, it was just 'Steve'. I mean I hate to sound mean but that was not worth seeing.

{"value":"1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray. First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT. Then they hyped up THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA which is by far the worst movie of the year. What is it about? Who the heck knows. Its full of self-indulgence and loaded with bad acting. I always like to stay and watch the credits, but when this thing was over I couldn't get out of the movie theatre fast enough. Most of the audience that attended the showing that I was at, felt pretty much the same way. Dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers. It's an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and

{"value":"\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" (an amazingly incovenient title) is simply a bad movie; it has no heart, no deep ideas, nothing very special about it. Yes, the CGI backgrounds look interesting, but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus. Additionally, the movie uses music the same way as, say, \"Gilligan's Island\" or the Scooby-Doo cartoons-- IT NEVER STOPS. Terribly, simply terrible. There are no fresh ideas, either, just gobs and gobs and gobs and... etc., of bits taken from older movies and serials. There is no gatekeeper here, the movie just seems to exist because it can. Save your money and your time. Not entertaining at all.","finished_norm":["sky","captain","and","the","world","of","tomorrow","a","amazingli","incoveni","titl","be","simpli","a","bad","movi","it","have","no","heart","no","deep","idea","noth","veri","special","about","it","ye","the","cgi","background","look","interest","but","the","result","be","that","the","whole","thing","be","shoot","in","a","annoi","soft","focu","addition","the","movi","us","music","the","same","wai","a","sai","gilligan","island","or","the","scoobydoo","cartoon","it","never","stop","terribli","simpli","terribl","there","be","no","fresh","idea","either","just","gob","and","gob","and","gob","and","etc","of","bit","take","from","old","movi","and","serial","there","be","no","gatekeep","here","the","movi","just","seem","to","exist","becaus","it","can","save","your","monei","and","your","time","not","entertain","at","all"],"filtered":["sky","captain","world","tomorrow","amazingli","incoveni","titl","simpli","bad","movi","heart","deep","idea","noth","veri","special","ye","cgi","background","look","interest","result","whole","thing","shoot","annoi","soft","focu","addition","movi","us","music","wai","sai","gilligan","island","scoobydoo","cartoon","never","stop","terribli","simpli","terribl","fresh","idea","either","gob","gob","gob","etc","bit","take","old","movi","serial","gatekeep","movi","seem","exist","becaus","save","monei","time","entertain"],"filtered2":["sky","captain","world","tomorrow","amazingli","incoveni","titl","simpli","bad","heart","deep","idea","noth","veri","special","ye","cgi","background","look","interest","result","whole","thing","shoot","annoi","soft","focu","addition","us","music","wai","gilligan","island","scoobydoo","cartoon","never","stop","terribli","simpli","terribl","fresh","idea","either","gob","gob","gob","etc","bit","take","old","serial","gatekeep","seem","exist","becaus","save","monei","time","entertain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,9,15,16,22,29,31,33,35,42,49,56,60,67,111,117,118,123,126,165,166,189,195,201,203,207,209,264,271,315,429,447,528,614,619,653,720,801,834,1012,1133,1153,1381,1392,1658,1761,1989,2235,4348,4430,4444,5955],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,9,15,16,22,29,31,33,35,42,49,56,60,67,111,117,118,123,126,165,166,189,195,201,203,207,209,264,271,315,429,447,528,614,619,653,720,801,834,1012,1133,1153,1381,1392,1658,1761,1989,2235,4348,4430,4444,5955],"values":[0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.6219954307453837,1.6920303308087352,1.8610609350701788,1.838176641236591,1.9570915389266579,2.1183455303375887,2.2797301185117202,2.354379525480895,4.523814194644097,2.2391270689902285,2.448847599972298,2.4423870329693536,2.498193474075453,2.51289241584188,5.122871637503154,2.569760528637609,2.5531798379045583,2.6026896854443837,2.757740698455715,2.757740698455715,2.854312708080462,3.2872346624216657,3.2070272508030975,3.4198487640477615,3.553030933689863,3.5929222627171646,3.9911462095687695,4.072271754381138,3.7881170224473255,3.8240921249056035,4.297765483040301,4.403125998698128,4.213208095012239,4.449957298382227,4.760735085628657,4.637773374493822,5.00274712124725,4.956227105612356,5.039114765418124,5.999576715605417,5.967828017290836,6.948657270302562,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.1979187568395035,7.40887161842552E-5,7.466468530535579E-5,7.423327195823191E-5,7.423448818681562E-5,7.413072320721571E-5,7.435119836470951E-5,7.409938447527556E-5,7.426598690400547E-5,8.239405844950526E-5,0.709144275328453,7.397977173162276E-5,7.536056748464116E-5,7.643560253924138E-5,7.40337170094199E-5,7.382911975814707E-5,7.567069479786285E-5,7.43581645107699E-5,7.412746859504153E-5,7.418890708686733E-5,7.490672827560163E-5,7.443183463565132E-5,7.451658657117176E-5,7.459686983548791E-5,0.05054354272139443,7.477624788355009E-5,7.791969929058275E-5,7.400176523944073E-5,7.400374495996396E-5,7.419123302932768E-5,7.576815031901041E-5,7.435385609010043E-5,7.981256586960822E-5,7.45630025151368E-5,7.408231283295709E-5,7.44242515422446E-5,7.4008080504195E-5,7.405181383465159E-5,7.382874883468007E-5,7.384790341827626E-5,7.401412607391338E-5,7.479481827258913E-5,7.441475436979746E-5,7.412053923284735E-5,7.50211815046582E-5,7.414898710083473E-5,7.661258973268978E-5,7.54859792693817E-5,7.386625865938882E-5,7.402950760825781E-5,7.400383138594493E-5,0.03671603013143552,7.403060902620004E-5,7.384134741195832E-5,7.465186187491408E-5,7.404967734583599E-5,7.9632289715403E-5,7.398865078987557E-5,7.386540443848315E-5,7.421809006518112E-5,7.495427114280512E-5,7.421318011636383E-5,7.385173917352674E-5,7.402369163725876E-5,7.382964180646611E-5,7.553790669180947E-5,7.446564951347419E

I bet kids dint understand the jokes.<br /><br />Despite that I dint like this flick.<br /><br />I am completely disappointed. 4/10","finished_norm":["from","the","creator","of","shrek","okai","that","grab","my","attentionbr","br","good","the","creator","of","shrek","conjur","make","madagascar","madagascar","be","half","a","good","a","shrekbr","br","and","now","flush","awai","be","half","a","good","a","madagascarbr","br","that","mean","flush","awai","be","not","good","the","anim","and","all","that","special","effect","be","extrem","good","but","the","movi","wasntbr","br","the","stori","of","thi","movi","be","onli","mean","for","kid","it","serious","not","possibl","for","adult","to","actual","love","thi","flickbr","br","but","there","be","mani","joke","mean","for","adult","i","bet","kid","dint","understand","the","jokesbr","br","despit","that","i","dint","like","thi","flickbr","br","i","be","complet","disappoint"],"filtered":["creator","shrek","okai","grab","attentionbr","br","good","creator","shrek","conjur","make","madagascar","madagascar","half","good","shrekbr","br","flush","awai","half","good","madagascarbr","br","mean","flush","awai","good","anim","special","effect","extrem","good","movi","wasntbr","br","stori","thi","movi","onli","mean","kid","serious","possibl","adult","actual","love","thi","flickbr","br","mani","joke","mean","adult","bet","kid","dint","understand","jokesbr","br","despit","dint","like","thi","flickbr","br","complet","disappoint"],"filtered2":["creator","shrek","okai","grab","attentionbr","good","creator","shrek","conjur","make","madagascar","madagascar","half","good","shrekbr","flush","awai","half","good","madagascarbr","mean","flush","awai","good","anim","special","effect","extrem","good","wasntbr","stori","onli","mean","kid","serious","possibl","adult","actual","love","flickbr","mani","joke","mean","adult","bet","kid","dint","understand","jokesbr","despit","dint","like","flickbr","complet","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,11,17,39,50,52,54,88,103,106,114,155,187,191,203,206,212,214,277,329,371,391,402,734,1451,1550,2080,4183,4474,6465,8212],"values":[1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,11,17,39,50,52,54,88,103,106,114,155,187,191,203,206,212,214,277,329,371,391,402,734,1451,1550,2080,4183,4474,6465,8212],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,3.3930723249613526,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.5538940054862738,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,1.8113893252729412,6.0951670240402,2.098582041218749,2.159084361316692,4.886614839193365,4.614953293582877,2.4732161909892554,2.5460113484259455,2.569760528637609,5.194609285626992,2.5983793339432615,2.7303758068497004,3.1163992333432793,2.951986790814132,3.0466846007279185,3.109204957709252,3.084424928710765,7.5833136983049,4.499089986959872,4.558366596889411,10.0054942424945,11.874112717248165,11.999153431210834,13.589013180950609,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.8887113299534E-5,8.828772671444451E-5,8.897407960296297E-5,8.845998642314443E-5,8.846143574042716E-5,8.833778433123465E-5,8.860051327910476E-5,8.830043957020211E-5,8.849897114768399E-5,9.818477751986997E-5,0.7165668730540786,8.81579031926393E-5,8.980332673848366E-5,9.108439092743449E-5,8.822218701599295E-5,8.797837895537034E-5,9.017288956648985E-5,8.86088144784143E-5,8.83339059766755E-5,8.840711907922911E-5,8.926250980813851E-5,8.869660339132207E-5,8.879759793012797E-5,8.889326738243782E-5,8.957547754095788E-5,8.910702301084551E-5,9.28529129797584E-5,8.818411172894185E-5,8.818647086044699E-5,8.840989078567604E-5,9.028902231734615E-5,8.860368035426924E-5,9.510854509005566E-5,8.885290943216274E-5,8.828009616881515E-5,8.868756700747279E-5,8.819163730635052E-5,8.824375207532643E-5,8.797793694488112E-5,8.800076248065724E-5,8.819884150200431E-5,8.912915239190243E-5,8.867624971370989E-5,8.832564861081449E-5,8.939889785653447E-5,0.06627392049048675,9.129529749690816E-5,8.995277353616344E-5,8.802263548095451E-5,8.821717088832102E-5,8.818657384985998E-5,9.066847553504754E-5,8.821848339164529E-5,8.79929500238629E-5,8.895879857798793E-5,8.824120613108019E-5,9.489371923457694E-5,8.816848391138945E-5,8.802161754967216E-5,8.844189493912758E-5,0.21030229341906415,8.843604400471153E-5,8.80053333536422E-5,8.821024029369623E-5,8.7979001053602E-5,9.001465278466989E-5,8.873689884852346E-5,8.854787626175079E-5,8.847043714199636E-5,8.87929259485532E-5,8.797579144011335E-5,8.84722918832675E-5,8.990725372576051E-5,8.813344894506968E-5,9.031470588602039E-5,8.836646483018048E-5,8.905806509364349E-5,8.85137813777724E-5,8.794820843840592E-5,8.805722628309946E-5]}}
{"value":"A Cinderella story made for adults who live in dreamland. The romance is very unrealistic, fluttery, lovey dovey, perfect etc. The Cinderella plot till the very end and Shahid Kapoor is the only reason for my stars. If you're looking for a dreamy romance with a twist, this is definitely you're movie, but for the rest of us real world people, I'd highly recommend saving your three hour watch time. Wake up people!<br /><br />Four out of the five people that saw the film with me would not recommend the film. We had a great time bashing majority of the unrealistic scenes. Maybe I'm missing something.. I just can't believe a movie like this can beat a classic like

{"value":"A bum gives a Secret Serviceman a tip about a Secret Service man in the presidential detail who plans to kill the president. Baloney. How did the bum know? The script then turns to a most detailed examination of how the Secret Service works, but who cares. Most of this just slows down the movie. All the chases that follow are this film's version of the tiresome car chases of many movies. Then, after a lot of impossible athleticism in which our hero outruns and out-guns all his buddies, we have a shootout in the Toronto City Hall. The Canadians are clearly marked with maple leafs, but how did they get into this? Finally, all is worked out.

{"value":"So, I know that I voted 1 out of 10 but really this deserves no more than half of a star. I hated it. It was so stupid and unrealistic, I can't believe any of the stars signed on to make this ridiculously absurd project.<br /><br />James G. and Cathrine O'Hara were excellent in their characters and Ben Affleck and Christina Applegate were just as good too, but the story sucked and I encourage anyone who sees this in the video store to not even bother picking it up and reading the back cover, but to just walk away...I don't even want to get into what the movie is about, because it is too stupid to pontificate about.<br /><br />Don't rent this!

Or how about the woman in her underwear, holding a knife and jumping up and down on the bed?<br /><br />Someone should do a 'What's Up Tiger Lily' on this bomb.

This show is like a bad pie in which a child would have put only sugar and butter thinking that because these ingredients are the best, they are sufficient. Unfortunately for this show, the only two ingredients of this show are finally vacuity and a total lack of credibility.","finished_norm":["befor","start","to","watch","the","show","i","have","hear","it","be","great","and","aesthet","veri","interest","what","a","decept","the","script","be","so","dumb","that","i","be","quit","sure","the","author","be","son","and","grandson","of","scoobidoo","writer","and","what","about","the","sfx","and","color","thei","be","so","extrem","that","it","be","pain","to","watch","color","be","not","satur","thei","be","over","satur","like","script","be","overwrit","and","show","be","overr","thi","show","be","like","a","bad","pie","in","which","a","child","would","have","put","onli","sugar","and","butter","think","that","becaus","thi","ingredi","be","the","well","thei","be","suffici","unfortun","for","thi","show","the","onli","two","ingredi","of","thi","show","be","final","vacuiti","and","a","total","lack","of","credibl"],"filtered":["befor","start","watch","show","hear","great","aesthet","veri","interest","decept","script","dumb","quit","sure","author","son","grandson","scoobidoo","writer","sfx","color","thei","extrem","pain","watch","color","satur","thei","satur","like","script","overwrit","show","overr","thi","show","like","bad","pie","child","put","onli","sugar","butter","think","becaus","thi","ingredi","well","thei","suffici","unfortun","thi","show","onli","two","ingredi","thi","show","final","vacuiti","total","lack","credibl"],"filtered2":["befor","start","watch","show","hear","great","aesthet","veri","interest","decept","script","dumb","quit","sure","author","son","grandson","scoobidoo","writer","sfx","color","extrem","pain","watch","color","satur","satur","like","script","overwrit","show","overr","show","like","bad","pie","child","put","onli","sugar","butter","think","becaus","ingredi","well","suffici","unfortun","show","onli","two","ingredi","show","final","vacuiti","total","lack","credibl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,9,11,12,15,20,22,28,47,51,60,71,77,79,119,120,156,159,180,183,184,216,227,287,329,420,434,459,875,1112,1208,2092,2111,3137,4142,4173,4413,4692,6651,6931,7346,8366],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,9,11,12,15,20,22,28,47,51,60,71,77,79,119,120,156,159,180,183,184,216,227,287,329,420,434,459,875,1112,1208,2092,2111,3137,4142,4173,4413,4692,6651,6931,7346,8366],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,7.726147096759545,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,1.9214926742550966,3.8927804517536475,1.9469506069506084,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.3451551414151686,2.300267965194495,2.7097314792693545,2.4885128563647294,2.496249838866882,2.6070186965339692,2.6005321873043625,2.841890188081905,2.951986790814132,3.3023374306074227,3.4101163271295305,3.2829611516442836,7.856464768316401,4.2574141875167335,4.297765483040301,5.259176650194926,4.9909126636002465,11.124725818365345,5.9370563586240825,5.850044981634453,5.967828017290836,6.0662680901040895,6.543192162194399,13.321950395701563,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.453756377014878E-5,7.403493955218676E-5,7.461049061125168E-5,7.417939040164769E-5,7.418060574744275E-5,7.407691608472532E-5,7.429723121229776E-5,7.40456000997235E-5,7.421208160157042E-5,0.0938953344562012,0.44672940443173487,7.392607417591097E-5,0.32253545727001265,7.638012244070032E-5,7.397998029801064E-5,7.377553155182295E-5,7.561576990076533E-5,7.430419230204332E-5,7.407366383488228E-5,7.413505773212822E-5,7.485235789677215E-5,7.437780895412342E-5,7.446249937320942E-5,7.454272436463612E-5,7.511480147804147E-5,0.09125863622118136,0.03999243504749444,7.394805171993797E-5,7.395003000349876E-5,7.413738198632404E-5,7.57131546846944E-5,7.429988700860246E-5,7.975463463243393E-5,7.450888162657662E-5,7.40285408487039E-5,7.437023136483725E-5,7.39543624008138E-5,7.399806398782359E-5,7.377516089758743E-5,7.379430157800042E-5,7.396040358240947E-5,7.474052912263452E-5,7.43607410858278E-5,7.406673950230368E-5,7.496672805097597E-5,7.409516672166049E-5,7.655698116957715E-5,7.543118844639861E-5,7.381264349612537E-5,7.397577395220476E-5,7.395011636674822E-5,7.603135062291657E-5,7.397687457069262E-5,7.378775033030103E-5,7.459767648858226E-5,7.399592904975928E-5,7.957448933006304E-5,7.393494678937875E-5,7.38117898952483E-5,7.416421952823819E-5,7.489986625541065E-5,7.415931314326333E-5,7.379813454910225E-5,7.396996220267623E-5,7.377605322121789E-5,7.54830781777712E-5,7.441159928771963E-5,7.42530916864199E-5,7.418815400183621E-5,7.44585816160494E-5,7.377336175379132E-5,7.418970932173178E-5,7.539301715649206E-5,7.390556771586285E-5,7.573469200958703E-5,7.410096652848234E-5,7.46809178490704E-5,7.4224500932435E-5,7.375023163208503E-5,7.384165010940182E-5]}}
{"value":"I think Phillip Kaufman read the cliff's Notes version of the Kundera novel and then set about making this film. Okay, of course it won't have the punch of the original. Kundera's novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept, his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs. This film does not even try! The one dream sequence of Tereza's, so vital to the atmosphere of the book, is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever. Also, and this is perhaps a lesser point, Daniel Day-Lewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this (I know it's not really a valid complaint, but hey). A perfect example of the Hollywood-izing of otherwise fine literature.","finished_norm":["i","think","phillip","kaufman","read","the","cliff","note","version","of","the","kundera","novel","and","then","set","about","make","thi","film","okai","of","cours","it","wo","not","have","the","punch","of","the","origin","kundera","novel","be","great","becaus","of","hi","manipul","of","the","narr","concept","hi","abil","to","step","in","and","out","of","stori","he","construct","thi","film","doe","not","even","try","the","on","dream","sequenc","of","tereza","so","vital","to","the","atmospher","of","the","book","be","rework","and","make","no","sens","whatsoev","conjur","and","thi","be","perhap","a","lesser","point","daniel","daylewi","look","a","lot","like","ben","still","in","thi","i","know","it","not","realli","a","valid","complaint","but","hei","a","perfect","exampl","of","the","hollywood","of","otherwis","fine","literatur"],"filtered":["think","phillip","kaufman","read","cliff","note","version","kundera","novel","set","make","thi","film","okai","cours","wo","punch","origin","kundera","novel","great","becaus","hi","manipul","narr","concept","hi","abil","step","stori","construct","thi","film","doe","even","try","dream","sequenc","tereza","vital","atmospher","book","rework","make","sens","whatsoev","conjur","thi","perhap","lesser","point","daniel","daylewi","look","lot","like","ben","still","thi","know","realli","valid","complaint","hei","perfect","exampl","hollywood","otherwis","fine","literatur"],"filtered2":["think","phillip","kaufman","read","cliff","note","version","kundera","novel","set","make","okai","cours","wo","punch","origin","kundera","novel","great","becaus","manipul","narr","concept","abil","step","stori","construct","doe","even","try","dream","sequenc","tereza","vital","atmospher","book","rework","make","sens","whatsoev","conjur","perhap","lesser","point","daniel","daylewi","look","lot","like","ben","still","know","realli","valid","complaint","hei","perfect","exampl","hollywood","otherwis","fine","literatur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,12,13,16,17,18,22,26,36,39,51,64,66,69,72,109,145,151,173,191,199,220,300,307,318,349,406,464,474,560,607,627,677,726,835,847,854,974,992,1060,1198,1542,1754,1799,1877,2561,2707,2739,2874,3846,4290,4369,4374,5079],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,12,13,16,17,18,22,26,36,39,51,64,66,69,72,109,145,151,173,191,199,220,300,307,318,349,406,464,474,560,607,627,677,726,835,847,854,974,992,1060,1198,1542,1754,1799,1877,2561,2707,2739,2874,3846,4290,4369,4374,5079],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.7139899308309823,1.883428577602134,1.929723173391612,2.127032521151058,1.9209463754160525,2.125691139326857,2.34599021453259,2.8002454868101863,2.4368824319140248,2.5460113484259455,2.558331832813986,2.8336934208777267,2.932274249550174,2.8767855639325206,2.902686292364678,3.0568369721919364,3.121829110937649,3.2872346624216657,7.293333077447711,3.4623020803001006,3.68099128126493,3.477726550625732,3.6559115968679063,3.7034641371169887,3.8614098879127985,3.900174431363043,4.291900363587903,4.030886538218284,4.004218291136122,4.160564361526816,4.34596758485818,4.597282013139085,4.6973654716960676,4.8085911068062925,5.00274712124725,5.290429193699031,5.583416318380505,5.390512652256013,5.373120909544144,5.7959777603641776,5.907203395474402,5.9370563586240825,6.389041482367141,6.137727054086234]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.662031301323374E-5,6.617107666802772E-5,6.668549369174803E-5,6.630018419877276E-5,6.630127045264518E-5,6.620859452607782E-5,6.640550816288097E-5,6.618060487069316E-5,6.63294029961344E-5,0.45532594256394565,0.4310196307763739,6.60737747832202E-5,6.730700902375742E-5,6.826715829725618E-5,6.612195509051713E-5,6.59392225355843E-5,0.07875024634394737,6.641172985774603E-5,0.029839178108724725,6.626056046852574E-5,6.69016702536588E-5,6.647752707671185E-5,6.655322182635686E-5,6.66249254583244E-5,6.71362375328684E-5,6.678513391086884E-5,6.959265406737522E-5,6.609341791063521E-5,6.6095186064347E-5,6.626263784447171E-5,6.767103469960454E-5,6.6407881865108E-5,7.128323565623072E-5,6.659467743720981E-5,6.616535762373187E-5,6.647075436581822E-5,6.60990582819327E-5,6.613811796215977E-5,6.593889125159887E-5,6.595599884213312E-5,6.610445777969619E-5,6.680171973797106E-5,6.646227212778663E-5,6.619949888259228E-5,6.700389220842949E-5,6.622490661200889E-5,6.842523139866891E-5,6.741901842614066E-5,6.59723925135243E-5,6.611819553546788E-5,6.609526325424187E-5,6.795543241709998E-5,6.611917924816871E-5,6.595014345660286E-5,6.667404066296568E-5,6.613620979351414E-5,7

The story line wasn't that great and I think they should have gotten two other people to play Taylor and Courtney.

{"value":"Spend your time any other way, even housework is better than this movie. The jokes aren't funny, the fun rhymes that are Dr. Seus aren't there. A very lousy way to waste an evening. My kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored with it and left to play Barbies and the older ones left to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and did dishes. So I finished it alone. It was the worst \"kids\" movie I have seen. If you want to watch a fun kids movie watch Shrek 2, that movie is fun for kids and their parents. AVOID THIS MOVIE. It isn't funny, isn't cute, the cat's makeup is about the only good thing in it and you can see that on the disc

{"value":"I rented this flick for one reason Tom Savini, I respect his work but this was a real let down, I had horrible clichés, half of the film was naked women so called \"fallen angels\" running around trying to act scary, oh and then there was the occasional \"Blair Witch\" black and white motion sicken camera scenes. Tom's character was really awful, Horrible script. And you got to love these lines they use. \"Is anyone there, who is out there, this isn't funny\" No but your acting was.

I was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn't make me satisfy. So I can't be judging on how the film was made, but anyway... it still sucks.

{"value":"After Life is a Miracle, I did not expect much. It's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as Do You Remember Dolly Bell, for instance. Zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story. The wild and unbridled humor of Underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here. It appears that Kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies, beginning with Black Cat, White Cat, which I think was great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. I liked his early films so much, and this is why it's especially disappointing to see something like this. Let's hope his next one will be

{"value":"I find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that I didn't. This movie has a VERY hard time following and/or staying to a plot. If someone tells you it's a comedy, don't be fooled, it's about 98% percent odd-drama and 2% comedy. All actors turn in a great performance, that cannot be denied, however it seems like it really lost something somewhere. Don't know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what. This had potential, and instead it was really a flop. I would really like the hour and a half I invested in this movie back, but the video rental place doesn't do returns on time.

And he was not funny!! I thought the talking suit was really dumb!!! In the original television series the suit doesn't talk and move around!!

{"value":"They're showing this on some off-network. It's well crap. While it is not as bad as the B-movies they show on the Sci-fi network on Saturdays but still a fairly large pile of crap. The acting is passable. The plot and writing are fairly sub-standard and the pacing is entirely too slow. Every minute of the movie feels like the part of the movie where they're wrapping things up before the credits - not the peak of the movie, the denouement. Also, large portions of the cast look way to old for the age range they're playing. The whole thing is predictable, boring and not worthy of being watched. Save your time. It's not even worth the time it takes to watch it for
