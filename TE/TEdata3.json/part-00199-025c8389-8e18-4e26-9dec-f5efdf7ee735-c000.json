{"value":"Nu Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with budgets of roughly $2 million. Some feature extensive effects work, others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both -- for $2 million.<br /><br />Mr. Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $20 million dollars but it's painfully obvious that this was probably produced for $750,000 if not considerably less than that. Few sets are utilized, a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurish.<br /><br />It's painful to watch. Not so much because it is poorly directed, poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget.<br /><br />Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by P.T. Barnum.","finished_norm":["nu","imag","ufo","and","other","produc","film","for","the","sci","fi","channel","that","come","in","with","budget","of","roughli","million","some","featur","extens","effect","work","other","featur","recogniz","cast","and","still","other","featur","both","for","millionbr","br","mr","hine","initi","claim","that","thi","film","be","budget","at","million","dollar","but","it","painfulli","obviou","that","thi","be","probabl","produc","for","if","not","consider","littl","than","that","few","set","be","util","a","numb","of","scene","be","shoot","against","green","screen","and","much","effect","seem","incomplet","and","amateurishbr","br","it","pain","to","watch","not","so","much","becaus","it","be","poorli","direct","poorli","execut","and","misguid","but","becaus","mani","of","u","have","be","follow","the","progress","of","thi","product","for","quit","some","time","and","have","high","hope","for","thi","film","despit","it","rel","modest","budgetbr","br","that","of","u","who","believ","in","thi","movi","when","it","be","origin","announc","have","join","the","legion","of","that","speak","of","by","pt","barnum"],"filtered":["nu","imag","ufo","produc","film","sci","fi","channel","come","budget","roughli","million","featur","extens","effect","work","featur","recogniz","cast","still","featur","millionbr","br","mr","hine","initi","claim","thi","film","budget","million","dollar","painfulli","obviou","thi","probabl","produc","consider","littl","set","util","numb","scene","shoot","green","screen","much","effect","seem","incomplet","amateurishbr","br","pain","watch","much","becaus","poorli","direct","poorli","execut","misguid","becaus","mani","u","follow","progress","thi","product","quit","time","high","hope","thi","film","despit","rel","modest","budgetbr","br","u","believ","thi","movi","origin","announc","join","legion","speak","pt","barnum"],"filtered2":["nu","imag","ufo","produc","sci","fi","channel","come","budget","roughli","million","featur","extens","effect","work","featur","recogniz","cast","still","featur","millionbr","mr","hine","initi","claim","budget","million","dollar","painfulli","obviou","probabl","produc","consider","littl","set","util","numb","scene","shoot","green","screen","effect","seem","incomplet","amateurishbr","pain","watch","becaus","poorli","direct","poorli","execut","misguid","becaus","mani","u","follow","progress","product","quit","time","high","hope","despit","rel","modest","budgetbr","u","believ","origin","announc","join","legion","speak","pt","barnum"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,8,14,19,22,34,35,48,50,64,69,91,92,102,106,109,112,117,120,148,181,190,192,211,256,260,261,305,344,357,383,391,398,458,516,662,728,742,751,807,1038,1165,1172,1226,1241,1319,1504,1981,2493,2921,3175,3786,4386,4420,4471,4663,4993,5287,5685,6933,6969,7620],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,8,14,19,22,34,35,48,50,64,69,91,92,102,106,109,112,117,120,148,181,190,192,211,256,260,261,305,344,357,383,391,398,458,516,662,728,742,751,807,1038,1165,1172,1226,1241,1319,1504,1981,2493,2921,3175,3786,4386,4420,4471,4663,4993,5287,5685,6933,6969,7620],"values":[0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1175081997259209,1.312380678011735,2.5958480334723544,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.883428577602134,2.127032521151058,2.0105926690411424,2.0489535369135887,2.087553710177271,4.318168722633384,2.125691139326857,4.493325799357863,2.2797301185117202,2.2044500422972613,2.3018654096236517,2.4442286541160034,2.558331832813986,2.5318267134339894,2.5687161421197025,5.497904384845272,2.6754694156628323,5.417060555847441,8.583844132189668,2.983093497946387,3.2829611516442836,3.0433232530252132,3.109204957709252,6.287696698363132,3.2829611516442836,3.442099372982581,3.616452760127359,3.7740817043309423,3.7740817043309423,3.8023521382691974,7.800348862726086,4.145296889396028,4.246178114249808,4.327618446189983,4.3095999406873045,4.3095999406873045,4.403125998698128,4.566029469634981,4.838444069955973,5.2288713006995975,5.408212229355414,5.541743621979936,5.7446844659766265,6.214688095222362,5.9370563586240825,6.868614562629026,6.255510089742618,6.101359409915359,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141,6.948657270302562,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.706739317338049E-4,1.7052268893442052E-4,1.705647923035752E-4,1.7053050332444477E-4,1.705466420137983E-4,1.705217487237574E-4,1.7057478335501716E-4,1.7049637786873371E-4,1.7052272497264758E-4,1.7069894173100006E-4,0.03432875806684206,1.7052300663209326E-4,1.7068450269532517E-4,1.7070228507572963E-4,1.7062473948476742E-4,1.7053117501941565E-4,1.7058984433887932E-4,1.706701244995844E-4,1.7053997880870424E

{"value":"I had a video of the thing. And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep. It's slow-moving, and the idea of a mid-Atlantic platform, which may have been revolutionary at the time, is now just a great big yawnaroony. Apart from Conrad Veidt, the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable, and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting. When the water started to spill big-time it even, on one occasion, woke me up.<br /><br />But give the man his due. No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt. He doesn't wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals. He holds it in his fingers, while showing us the old pearly-browns. There are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background,and looks very artistically done.

{"value":"Normally I would have given this movie a 6. It tackles a very important topic and it does it relatively well - despite Katie Wright which is an accomplishment in and of itself.<br /><br />I have no idea if she was actually instructed to play the character like this or is naturally irritating, but she did an awesome job at making it impossible for me to care for Lexi. There's no dimension to her other than how confused, helpless and clueless she is, and how good she is at whimpering. I can understand how a young girl who blames herself for the loss of her friend and whose eating disorder has spiraled out of control would be distraught, scared and in pain. However, Wright's entire performance is based on incessant wailing and sniveling, the rest being whining. I couldn't help but feel this particular girl's problem was caused not by the demon that is Bulimia, but by her not having a backbone.

{"value":"If you want to see a movie about two utterly unsympathetic characters, this is the one. The acting is superb, both from John Cassavetes as the insane paranoid whom, as the saying goes, they REALLY ARE out to get, and from Peter Falk as his lifelong best friend to whom he turns for rescue. Big mistake, but since they're both amoral mobsters, and misogynistic bastards to boot, it's hard to decide whom to root for LESS. Only writer/director Elaine May could have gotten away with this one. I thought it interesting that in a lengthy interview with producer Michael Hausman included on the DVD, he disclosed that the two stars had \"very different ideas\" about the script, that the director was nearly impossible to work with, that the director of photography had impossible demands made of him, that the crew was constantly angry about being made to sit around waiting, and so on.

{"value":"It's funny, when you stop and think about it: fright film fans tend to a deep and abiding affection toward those who scare the daylights out of them. THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE may give us nightmares, but who among us (the Faithful) didn't feel a very real twinge of love for Gunnar Hansen in BRUTAL MASSACRE- or for Ken Foree, forever and ever the resolute hero of the original DAWN OF THE DEAD? His cameo in the remake made me want to stand up and cheer (as did Tom Savini's cameo); I kid you not. And Brian Halloran and... Well, you get my drift (if not, just stand downwind...). These are some of the Heroes of Horror. To see this many of them gathered together in a single movie is almost unheard of (at least to this degree, to my knowledge). If only the writer(s) had been up to such a monumental task. Maybe someone else, somewhere along the line, will try again.

{"value":"Wanda Nevada is a pubescent fantasy movie using circa 1979 ideas of what constitutes illicit romance for 13 year old girls. Script, pacing, and direction are uniformly awful. Action sequences defy belief. Characters speak with the simplified diction one usually finds in films aimed at the under 10 set, but also includes multiple sexual references involving Shields' character as well as graphic deaths. <br /><br />The movie wants to be a comedy on some level but is never funny, an adventure picture but plot and action are insipid, and a children's movie but introduces pedophilia and child rape as real possibilities. It also wants to be a buddy picture, a coming of age picture, a ghost movie, an Indian spiritual movie, a travelogue, and a western. The overall affect is of massive stupidity with a nasty twist. Wanda Nevada is a complete waste of time unless you want to see a good many terrific shots of the Grand Canyon.

{"value":"My wife and I watch a film every night with no distractions, and mostly artsy films that require thought. I have tons of patience for films that are slow to blossom. My wife has double the attention span that I do. All that being said-- this film is just plain empty and BORING! It went nowhere. Never blossomed. It started fairly strong with a promising plot...then she bakes cookies...goes to Spain....she sulks, she stares....the credits roll. Uneven, full of holes, false starts & dead ends. We FF'd through several extended sequences of her just staring off into space. Artificial depth was implied when she played with the mud and cried. Zzzz...... It's like a beautifully shot chick-flick that's pretending to be deep or artsy. You never get to know nor understand Morvern at all. About halfway through you just don't care anymore.

{"value":"As far as Spaghetti Westerns go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the dull side of the genre. It's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the on-screen charisma necessary to pull it off. With one notable exception, the rest of the cast isn't particularly good. The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that I haven't seen before. There's just not much to get very excited about.<br /><br />The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for This Man Can't Die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is the character Melin.

{"value":"I don't know who Sue Kramer, the director of this film is, but I have a strong suspicion that A) she is a lesbian and B) she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic.<br /><br />I can imagine everyone thinking, \"My God, this is horrible. Not funny. Pedestrian. Totally lame.\" But keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti-gay or they \"don't get\" the gay lifestyle. (This is probably why Kramer did NOT cast gay people to play gay people too.) Anyway, it's not even worth reviewing. The actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do. It's full of clichés and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing - much less funny.<br /><br />I hated it and I'm not afraid to say so.

{"value":"I'll be short and to the point. This movie was an insult to any one with a room temperature IQ. Sorry liberals, feminists, etc. No women will ever be a Seal. They can forget about the draft or being in combat too. Ain't going to happen. You see, hard as it is to understand or accept, men and women are physically different.Regardless of the fact it is 2007,reality cannot change things in order for people to avoid having their feelings hurt. Men can't give birth or breast feed babies( Oh-I forgot about San Franfreako ).<br /><br />Women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in a combat or other physically challenging situations. How many women play in the NFL or NHL? Lastly, I couldn't give a bloody hoot in hell if what I just wrote upsets you.Come to think of it - if this does upset you that only warms my heart more. I didn't write one thing that wasn't the truth.

{"value":"Some unrealistic movie spoilers included.<br /><br />From real life experiences, this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning. I'm currently deployed on my second tour to Iraq as an infantry man. This film has nothing near what would happen in real life occurrences. From the very start to name a few: the bomb cart, the EOD elements rolling out solo with no escorts, the EOD staff sergeant sneaking of VBC, having sleeves rolled the entire time in ACUs, to where i had to call it quits on my 2 dollar haji copy, the sniper scene. The list would continue, however, it is unnecessary to list things wrong happening with a time span of 2 minutes before more things were incorrect; and the point was made.<br /><br />This movie is for people and critics to watch that have no understanding or experience with deployments or the military.<br /><br />People with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with

{"value":"We had to go to an appointment, so we turned on the DVR to record the ending. After it was over, I looked at my husband and said, \"Do you have a clue?\". He shook his head no. I said, \"So you made me watch the end of this movie and I have no clue what just happened\". He didn't \"make\" me, but you know.<br /><br />The movie body itself was quite good. There was a lot of suspense. It kept you wondering. Then came the ending. The ending was... well it just ENDED. You weren't let in on what happened or why. Right up until the credits I kept thinking something would happen to explain it, but it never did. So I came here expecting someone figured it out and I just wasn't paying attention. Nope. Here four years later, I'm just as clueless as tom sawyer was.<br /><br />I still have no clue what went on.

{"value":"Sadly IMDb does not allow me to rate Judges lower than 1. What a shame. This ghastly movie is so bad that I actually turned the damned thing off well before the ending. The script had a few bright moments, but the directing, editing, acting, audio quality, and especially timing on line delivery was so abhorrent as make Judges utterly unbearable.<br /><br />Judges was advertised as being like a modern day comic book style western, but in reality was nothing of the sort. What it is most like is dog poop on the bottom of your shoe. You can try to pretend it is okay, but it just keeps on stinking.<br /><br />Why video stores think it is okay to carry this kind of crap with constant gaps in the audio and worse than high school drama class acting is beyond me. We rent movies in order to see something better that what is on television. But Judges is worse than the most pathetic SciFi Channel original.

Though an Italian production, most of the filming appears to have been done in Germany. Douglas is fine, not just slumming it in an Giallo quickie. The striking Bolkan gives a terrific performance. The music is by Ennio Morricone and the cinematography is by the great Tonino Delli Colli, who managed to work with everyone in Italy (from Wertmuller and Fellini to Pasolini and Leone).","finished_norm":["a","not","bad","but","conjur","not","so","great","heist","film","kirk","dougla","be","a","recent","releas","from","prison","safecrack","who","after","turn","down","a","offer","from","the","mob","decid","to","pull","the","job","himself","he","recruit","circu","gymnast","giuliano","gemma","mayhem","ensu","dougla","and","gemma","soon","find","themselv","pursu","by","mafia","goon","romano","puppo","a","good","a","entangl","in","a","realli","goofi","love","triangl","with","dougla","infinit","patient","girlfriend","florinda","bolkan","director","michel","lupo","keep","the","pace","move","quickli","and","there","at","littl","on","excel","and","creativ","car","chase","sequenc","involv","puppo","gemma","though","a","italian","product","much","of","the","film","appear","to","have","be","do","in","germani","dougla","be","fine","not","just","slum","it","in","a","giallo","quicki","the","strike","bolkan","give","a","terrif","perform","the","music","be","by","ennio","morricon","and","the","cinematographi","be","by","the","great","tonino","delli","colli","who","manag","to","work","with","everyon","in","itali","from","wertmul","and","fellini","to","pasolini","and","leon"],"filtered":["bad","conjur","great","heist","film","kirk","dougla","recent","releas","prison","safecrack","turn","offer","mob","decid","pull","job","recruit","circu","gymnast","giuliano","gemma","mayhem","ensu","dougla","gemma","soon","find","themselv","pursu","mafia","goon","romano","puppo","good","entangl","realli","goofi","love","triangl","dougla","infinit","patient","girlfriend","florinda","bolkan","director","michel","lupo","keep","pace","move","quickli","littl","excel","creativ","car","chase","sequenc","involv","puppo","gemma","though","italian","product","much","film","appear","germani","dougla","fine","slum","giallo","quicki","strike","bolkan","give","terrif","perform","music","ennio","morricon","cinematographi","great","tonino","delli","colli","manag","work","everyon","itali","wertmul","fellini","pasolini","leon"],"filtered2":["bad","conjur","great","heist","kirk","dougla","recent","releas","prison","safecrack","turn","offer","mob","decid","pull","job","recruit","circu","gymnast","giuliano","gemma","mayhem","ensu","dougla","gemma","soon","find","themselv","pursu","mafia","goon","romano","puppo","good","entangl","realli","goofi","love","triangl","dougla","infinit","patient","girlfriend","florinda","bolkan","director","michel","lupo","keep","pace","move","quickli","littl","excel","creativ","car","chase","sequenc","involv","puppo","gemma","though","italian","product","appear","germani","dougla","fine","slum","giallo","quicki","strike","bolkan","give","terrif","perform","music","ennio","morricon","cinematographi","great","tonino","delli","colli","manag","work","everyon","itali","wertmul","fellini","pasolini","leon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,13,14,30,38,39,48,51,54,58,86,96,105,118,134,170,190,241,246,249,275,284,289,327,345,349,436,449,464,507,530,544,546,562,580,629,730,770,852,1030,1056,1125,1904,1914,1988,2291,2359,2468,2589,2669,2774,2923,3411,3725,3790,3819,3838,4056,4296,4303,4815,4831,4958,5165,5694,5765,5798,6023],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,13,14,30,38,39,48,51,54,58,86,96,105,118,134,170,190,241,246,249,275,284,289,327,345,349,436,449,464,507,530,544,546,562,580,629,730,770,852,1030,1056,1125,1904,1914,1988,2291,2359,2468,2589,2669,2774,2923,3411,3725,3790,3819,3838,4056,4296,4303,4815,4831,4958,5165,5694,5765,5798,6023],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.3364419891718522,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.6955116224012472,3.4279798616619646,1.8113893252729412,1.865701314626681,2.031112399272319,2.0390708128715254,2.1765612129984904,2.354379525480895,2.2443961816702407,2.4214486257841834,2.558331832813986,2.6627744961815836,2.673149229007135,2.6754694156628323,2.7832848715031413,3.110998680163279,2.8282659991423613,2.9674191958529437,3.0022328381570844,3.0568369721919364,3.2070272508030975,3.2597778161886266,3.2872346624216657,3.365138331846453,3.5784919978881358,3.4222967456864013,3.4572130107926293,3.432149042129413,3.5039747767006686,3.488143311483988,3.767137231978131,3.7264536553416874,4.2078172463773615,4.297765483040301,4.100845126825194,4.251780369798478,21.036706600779706,5.039114765418124,4.869215728622727,5.259176650194926,5.129498826886393,5.185068678041204,5.482320201509136,5.444579873526289,5.626901430320244,5.3560264761848435,5.695894301807195,6.255510089742618,5.9370563586240825,5.7959777603641776,5.9370563586240825,6.342521466732247,5.967828017290836,5.9370563586240825,6.543192162194399,6.0662680901040895,6.25551008

{"value":"Horrible acting, Bad story line, cheesy makeup, and this is just the tip of the iceberg. I have never seen a worse movie in my life, 5 minutes in I decided to fast forward to see if anything redeeming would happen... It didn't. (Aside from a nice breast shot) The movie apparently was filmed in some furniture warehouse, and the same warehouse was used for at least 90% of the sets. You even see this same red chair in several different \"locations\" If you are going to make a film at least rent an office building and an apartment, not some warehouse which will echo all your actor's dialog.. (Note to producers) Renting a small office space and an apartment for a month is much cheaper than an entire warehouse, and both are quite a bit more versatile and believable) If you spend your money to rent this people I hope you got it with a return guarantee...

{"value":"Rarely have I witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent. There is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film. What few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings. Actors of stature - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are deployed in roles which go nowhere; a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee-stained camera lens; a writer (John Grisham) who has never produced anything of merit, discovers new depths of under-motivated incoherence. The film has a cheap, lecherous feel about it - but barely at the level of commentary - its really part of the aesthetic. Normally, I come on to the IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. This egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless, bilious rant.

{"value":"The acronymic \"F.P.1\" stands for \"Floating Platform #1\". The film portends the building of an \"F.P.1\" in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, to be used as an \"air station\" for transatlantic plane flights. Based a contemporary Curt Siodmark novel; it was filmed in German as \"F.P.1 antwortet nicht\" (1932), in French as \"I.F.1 ne répond plus\" (1933), and in English as \"F.P.1\" (1933). Soon, technology made non-stop oceanic travel much more preferable.<br /><br />Stars Conrad Veidt (as Ellissen), Jill Esmond (as Droste), and Leslie Fenton (as Claire) find love and sabotage on and off the Atlantic platform. Karl Hartl directed. Mr. Veidt is most fun to watch; but, he is not convincing in the \"love triangle\" with Ms. Esmond and Mr. Fenton.

{"value":"Set in Providence, Rhode Island, Feeding the Masses tries to be a satiric look at the role of the media in government. At best, it could be applied to how the US try to control media during the Iraq War, but it ends up feeling hollow. There's never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good. Worst, the direction of the movie is atrocious, focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond \"Isn't this an odd way to hold the camera.\" Special effects are pretty bad...at one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city, and it's laughable at best.<br /><br />The film does have a couple bright spots...namely the advertisements for post-zombie services (including a reclamation service and a party bus). But it's far too little to make the film worthwhile.<br /><br />For a better zombie film, try Hide and Creep.

I can not believe that no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap knock off of RE.

Despite the fact that there are no zombies, the \"Rook\", the movie's nemesis, is some sort of bio-creature, very pail in color suggesting necrotic tissue, with a lot of cyborg components just like a super mutant of RE. So, a wag-of-the-finger to Mr. Richard Taylor for claiming any credit for this story.<br /><br />They are not the same movie obviously, but the writer got the idea watching Resident Evil I think.","finished_norm":["if","you","realli","enjoi","the","resid","evil","movi","then","you","should","just","see","it","instead","of","waist","hour","you","will","never","get","back","i","can","not","believ","that","no","on","have","comment","that","thi","movi","be","just","a","cheap","knock","off","of","re","a","special","commando","forc","be","the","uniqu","defens","for","a","facil","with","a","comput","matrix","that","have","a","have","and","holograph","project","and","thi","hive","ripoff","have","a","seri","of","trap","that","inevit","kill","off","on","member","of","the","squad","at","a","time","there","even","a","chess","refer","in","the","code","name","which","be","in","the","dialog","of","re","despit","the","fact","that","there","be","no","zombi","the","rook","the","movi","nemesi","be","some","sort","of","biocreatur","veri","pail","in","color","suggest","necrot","tissu","with","a","lot","of","cyborg","compon","just","like","a","super","mutant","of","re","so","a","wagofthefing","to","mr","richard","taylor","for","claim","ani","credit","for","thi","storybr","br","thei","be","not","the","same","movi","obvious","but","the","writer","get","the","idea","watch","resid","evil","i","think"],"filtered":["realli","enjoi","resid","evil","movi","see","instead","waist","hour","never","get","back","believ","comment","thi","movi","cheap","knock","re","special","commando","forc","uniqu","defens","facil","comput","matrix","holograph","project","thi","hive","ripoff","seri","trap","inevit","kill","member","squad","time","even","chess","refer","code","name","dialog","re","despit","fact","zombi","rook","movi","nemesi","sort","biocreatur","veri","pail","color","suggest","necrot","tissu","lot","cyborg","compon","like","super","mutant","re","wagofthefing","mr","richard","taylor","claim","ani","credit","thi","storybr","br","thei","movi","obvious","writer","get","idea","watch","resid","evil","think"],"filtered2":["realli","enjoi","resid","evil","see","instead","waist","hour","never","get","back","believ","comment","cheap","knock","re","special","commando","forc","uniqu","defens","facil","comput","matrix","holograph","project","hive","ripoff","trap","inevit","kill","member","squad","time","even","chess","refer","code","name","dialog","re","despit","fact","zombi","rook","nemesi","sort","biocreatur","veri","pail","color","suggest","necrot","tissu","lot","cyborg","compon","like","super","mutant","re","wagofthefing","mr","richard","taylor","claim","ani","credit","storybr","obvious","writer","get","idea","watch","resid","evil","think"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,7,8,12,13,15,27,42,63,68,72,76,91,97,123,143,152,174,200,203,268,269,280,287,321,338,341,351,356,357,391,432,618,641,646,659,715,751,765,875,1155,1300,1342,1410,1414,1615,1824,1858,1930,1963,2252,2307,2897,3015,3536,4080,4190,4290,5637,6117,7391],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,7,8,12,13,15,27,42,63,68,72,76,91,97,123,143,152,174,200,203,268,269,280,287,321,338,341,351,356,357,391,432,618,641,646,659,715,751,765,875,1155,1300,1342,1410,1414,1615,1824,1858,1930,1963,2252,2307,2897,3015,3536,4080,4190,4290,5637,6117,7391],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.3002700588679295,1.6219954307453837,1.8729627573220065,6.019259360045842,1.9209463754160525,2.1337665533324026,2.0105926690411424,2.0545557924622586,2.2619070973220485,2.3409902041158843,2.3131195476980753,2.456282578459816,2.5308211829319704,2.569760528637609,3.6746621462132825,2.76533567167316,2.8028805344481915,2.841890188081905,6.18993968377476,2.9720957437368454,2.933776879434709,3.0135689919434205,3.028335462059722,3.2829611516442836,3.109204957709252,3.235085203598255,3.5642670069567886,3.7034641371169887,3.5900195030592035,3.6405503117064195,3.68099128126493,3.8023521382691974,3.965503778955432,3.9282323841582003,4.291900363587903,4.3773181147422555,4.484804029712395,4.443131333311827,4.484804029712395,5.1994574154933035,4.979216623837056,5.170884043049248,4.848596441419991,9.823550686083045,5.014723312293965,5.3064295350454715,6.255510089742618,5.444579873526289,5.907203395474402,5.967828017290836,5.967828017290836,5.999576715605417,6.389041482367141,6.489124940924123,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.7555127883707352E-4,1.753957139738451E-4,1.7543902053052525E-4,1.7540375167560867E-4,1.7542035156011348E-4,1.7539474689479202E-4,1.7544929709613634E-4,1.7536865101711843E-4,1.753957510419362E-4,1.7557700354468834E-4,1.7697015596432152E-4,1.7539604075036082E-4,1.7556215188484697E-4,1.7558044243214414E-4,1.7550068082166677E-4,1.7540444256

{"value":"...for one of the worst Swedish movies ever...forgive me for being dull.<br /><br />First of all i haven't seen the first one (i was bored that's my reason for watching the 2nd before the 1st one), well i hope the first one is better than this, it was filled with weird cut scenes and very strange plot changes, For the people that have seen this and think 4/10 is high (belive me so do i), but it made me laugh a few times, because it was so bizarre so bad and i still laugh thinking of the punk that came up with this idea, what's next \"Det sjunde inseglet II\". Sequels not based on novel or book doesn't turning out great to often, and this is a perfect example of one.<br /><br />OK i'm gonna be honest with you: i did laugh a bit, it got a few decent jokes in it and slapstick humor. But don't buy it, rent it.

{"value":"Another of my delves into the bargain bin, this movie gave me exactly what I expected - a load of trashy horror complete with screaming ladies.<br /><br />It all started so well - I liked the little intro with the \"newsreel\" about the young couple being exposed to a nuclear blast, and was totally absorbed right up until the first person caught fire...<br /><br />From then onwards the film descended into outright silliness, and at times became almost embarrassing to watch. When the heroine turned out to have been afflicted with the same condition as the main character (the ability to light one's own farts without the aid of a match) it seemed almost as if someone had thrown the idea in at the last moment (\"that'll be good!\" you can almost hear them say...)

{"value":"God, I was bored out of my head as I watched this pilot. I had been expecting a lot from it, as I'm a huge fan of James Cameron (and not just since \"Titanic\", I might add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (Then again, he also wrote the leaden Strange Days..). But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration. In all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere. On top of that, I don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular \"A-Team\" episode. As for Alba, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie (pouty and surly), makes me also get bored of her \"gal wit an attitude\" schtick pretty soon.

{"value":"I'm a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K, so I waited anxiously to see this episode. I'll comment on the movie first, then the MST3K episode. The recipe for this movie: take talented actors, rich and beautiful Shakespeare material, and a $1.25 budget. Mix well, then drain of all life and movement, until dull and lifeless. Serve cold in a big, plain stone cauldron. Movie, I give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit. Okay, now the MST3K episode. I'll admit it, the first time I saw it, I fell asleep halfway through. I understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well. However, when I watched it a second time, I realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines I missed the first time around. The trick with this episode is: listen carefully! It takes a couple of viewings to catch each line. Give it a second chance, and You'll see what I mean.

{"value":"When i got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar movies.. I watched then with very low expectations. Now this movie isn't bad per se. You get what you pay for. It is a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it is not that bad. I would probably never watch this movie again. In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time. Despite the bad acting, cliché lines, and sub par camera work. I didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my DVD player. The story has been done many times in many movies.

{"value":"When i got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar movies.. I watched then with very low expectations. Now this movie isn't bad per se. You get what you pay for. It is a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it is not that bad. I would probably never watch this movie again. In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time. Despite the bad acting, cliché lines, and sub par camera work. I didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my DVD player. The story has been done many times in many movies.

{"value":"When i got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar movies.. I watched then with very low expectations. Now this movie isn't bad per se. You get what you pay for. It is a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it is not that bad. I would probably never watch this movie again. In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time. Despite the bad acting, cliché lines, and sub par camera work. I didn't have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my DVD player. The story has been done many times in many movies.

{"value":"This horrendously bad piece of trash manages to be racist, sexist and homophobic all at once, while pretending to be terribly chic and sophisticated. Atrocious performances, a cliche ridden screenplay, and boring direction make this movie one to steer clear of. Two scenes were especially offensive - the one in which Schaech scrubs his tongue after being kissed by another man (could it really have been that gross), and the scene where Eastwood is kissed by Schaech's best friend, who is pretending to be Russian. After he leaves the room she exclaims \"f**king foreigners\"! So much for her being a cultured artist who dreams of living in Paris!?!<br /><br />Jonathon Schaech can be a likeable actor on screen, and is astonishingly good-looking. It's a shame he didn't learn more from working with cutting edge gay director Gregg Araki on an earlier film, and try to salvage this film from descending into a string of gay stereotypes and a mire

{"value":"God, I was bored out of my head as I watched this pilot. I had been expecting a lot from it, as I'm a huge fan of James Cameron (and not just since \"Titanic\", I might add), and his name in the credits I thought would be a guarantee of quality (Then again, he also wrote the leaden Strange Days..). But the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration. In all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and I would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere. On top of that, I don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular \"A-Team\" episode. As for Alba, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie (pouty and surly), makes me also get bored of her \"gal wit an attitude\" schtick pretty soon.

{"value":"This is a really dumb movie. It could be fun with the cool looking aliens and the country setting, but it just isn't.<br /><br />Some aliens hear the broadcast of War of the Worlds when a small country radio station plays it on Halloween. They come to Earth to kill humans, but instead of killing, they make people their slaves and act goofy. The front cover of the film shows these aliens riding surfboards in space...not really what they do. These aren't party aliens, they are stupid cartoonish idiots with annoying high pitched modulated voices. The alien with the most tolerable voice also happens to be the Jack Nicholson rip-off alien who always wears his sunglasses. Other than the aliens, the acting is terrible. The writing is obviously meant for children, because every character is written like a kid.<br /><br />This is a dumb movie, that only children will appreciate, maybe.<br /><br />My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 100 mins.

{"value":"This is by far the worst film I have seen in my entire life. The acting is poor and the storyline is almost incomprehensible. Whether or not you like lightships or any ships for that matter is irrelevant. As for special effects the film has none. The whole film crew were probably on the boat out in rough seas rather than in a studio and when some of the men are \"stabbed\" (if you can even call it that) their reactions are totally unreal. The guns are more quiet than a mute. How this film could have one two awards puts serious questions to the state of the human mind. Well thats about it. This review is probably more fun to read than the film is to watch. If anyone is considering watching it or buying it I would seriously advise you against it for obvious reasons. I have said that it includes a spoiler. If the fact that some people get stabbed and a gun gets fired is a plot giveaway.
