{"value":"This was probably the worst movie ever, seriously. I could actually do better myself, it wasn't even set up properly. It's like this movie had a $5 budget and left with change. Don't watch it. I didn't even get all the way through this movie, had to turn it off. I've give this a 1/10 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie, but actually turned into a really bad comedy. Basically, a bunch of girls crashed into a car, broke a headlight, and the owner of that car went after them. The bit that i saw was a women with a gun telling a load of girls to take all their clothes off, what the hell? it must be some kind of cheesy porn movie as well.","finished_norm":["thi","be","probabl","the","wrong","movi","ever","serious","i","can","actual","do","well","myself","it","be","not","even","set","up","properli","it","like","thi","movi","have","a","budget","and","leav","with","chang","do","not","watch","it","i","do","not","even","get","all","the","wai","through","thi","movi","have","to","turn","it","off","i","have","give","thi","a","becaus","it","be","hilari","how","the","produc","of","thi","movi","want","it","to","be","a","horror","movi","but","actual","turn","into","a","realli","bad","comedi","basic","a","bunch","of","girl","crash","into","a","car","break","a","headlight","and","the","owner","of","that","car","go","after","them","the","bite","that","i","see","be","a","woman","with","a","gun","tell","a","load","of","girl","to","take","all","their","cloth","off","what","the","hell","it","must","be","some","kind","of","cheesi","porn","movi","a","good"],"filtered":["thi","probabl","wrong","movi","ever","serious","actual","well","even","set","properli","like","thi","movi","budget","leav","chang","watch","even","get","wai","thi","movi","turn","give","thi","becaus","hilari","produc","thi","movi","want","horror","movi","actual","turn","realli","bad","comedi","basic","bunch","girl","crash","car","break","headlight","owner","car","go","bite","see","woman","gun","tell","load","girl","take","cloth","hell","must","kind","cheesi","porn","movi","good"],"filtered2":["probabl","wrong","ever","serious","actual","well","even","set","properli","like","budget","leav","chang","watch","even","get","wai","turn","give","becaus","hilari","produc","want","horror","actual","turn","realli","bad","comedi","basic","bunch","girl","crash","car","break","headlight","owner","car","go","bite","see","woman","gun","tell","load","girl","take","cloth","hell","must","kind","cheesi","porn","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,13,20,22,25,30,31,33,37,44,52,70,74,83,84,90,96,109,122,127,141,148,154,256,261,278,284,286,360,371,394,419,501,543,632,879,971,1183,1296,1774,2079,5687],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,13,20,22,25,30,31,33,37,44,52,70,74,83,84,90,96,109,122,127,141,148,154,256,261,278,284,286,360,371,394,419,501,543,632,879,971,1183,1296,1774,2079,5687],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.604729392502474,3.4244306149452273,2.094675786251684,1.9486336368009016,2.292318797740072,4.442538903180445,2.0477128419653545,4.078141625743051,2.125691139326857,2.2489347673732487,2.4359679371086367,2.2657547357741192,2.3018654096236517,2.348499626138016,2.748952192422636,2.7085302779237206,2.8336934208777267,6.221997360326558,2.780700890737216,3.028335462059722,3.0466846007279185,3.0967381889441223,3.1758963322079246,3.5119855004467477,3.477726550625732,3.541919708264792,3.8962296530720266,4.181290492043933,4.315570107673808,4.370968887063596,4.828393734102471,4.944927550358424,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.234407602816465E-4,2.2324275812784204E-4,2.2329787848933354E-4,2.2325298847309993E-4,2.2327411672029308E-4,2.2324152723462212E-4,2.233109584489239E-4,2.232083125364084E-4,2.232428053079168E-4,2.23473502556528E-4,2.2524669975505112E-4,2.2324317404730215E-4,2.234545994406499E-4,2.2347787955470614E-4,2.2337635938917723E-4,2.2325386783430903E-4,2.2333067579913995E-4,2.2343577597443476E-4,2.2326539346890372E-4,2.2326457718847354E-4,2.2346543761534013E-4,2.2328694601974751E-4,2.2328728394518965E-4,2.2343032416998436E-4,2.2326547400635302E-4,2.2348055066696382E-4,2.23321345326801E-4,2.2324225779449917E-4,2.2334346629394164E-4,2.2341163393927867E-4,2.2328804127835596E-4,2.2340762949082013E-4,2.2351731705956885E-4,2.237247757880986E-4,2.2332095942123785E-4,2.2325373242729907E-4,2.233342280058662E-4,2.2327640592866786E-4,2.2320855076990665E-4,2.232653243272446E-4,2.2348907433600575E-4,2.2336647651074375E-4,2.2340813859831547E-4,2.2321965983456357E-4,2.2326538109796067E-4,2.2325364847537163E-4,2.2332921781121267E-4,2.2336794337671952E-4,2.2332252276763818E-4,2.2328712575322456E-4,2.2325420056448935E-4,2.2371161216552574E-4,2.233103777523478E-4,2.2326532992581879E-4,2.233091818425655E-4,2.2324248620167683E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760412E-4,2.232545139848123E-4,2.2324235876917262E-4,2.234209580113558E-4,2.2333127123814572E-4,2.2324226544800498E-4,2.2321956888982658E-4,2.2319712169645178E-4,2.2339892722621736E-4,2.2325320192525587E-4,2.233546845271625E-4,2.234202334647872E-4,2.2331887205251027E-4,2.232656256333522E-4,2.2321986151

{"value":"This movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school. I have to give it credit on its campiness though. Many times throughout the movie I found myself laughing hysterically. It was so bad at times that it was comical, which made it a fun watch.<br /><br />If you're looking for a low-grade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness, then pop a bowl of popcorn, invite some friends over, and have some fun.<br /><br />I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad. Dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the time and the soundtrack is kind of just there.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","have","mani","problem","associ","with","it","that","make","it","come","off","like","a","low","budget","class","project","from","someon","in","film","school","i","have","to","give","it","credit","on","it","campi","though","mani","time","throughout","the","movi","i","find","myself","laugh","hyster","it","be","so","bad","at","time","that","it","be","comic","which","make","it","a","fun","watchbr","br","if","you","re","look","for","a","lowgrad","slasher","movi","with","a","twist","of","psycholog","horror","and","a","dash","of","campi","ridicul","then","pop","a","bowl","of","popcorn","invit","some","friend","over","and","have","some","funbr","br","i","agre","with","other","comment","that","the","sound","be","veri","bad","dialog","be","next","to","imposs","to","follow","much","of","the","time","and","the","soundtrack","be","kind","of","just","there"],"filtered":["thi","movi","mani","problem","associ","make","come","like","low","budget","class","project","someon","film","school","give","credit","campi","though","mani","time","throughout","movi","find","laugh","hyster","bad","time","comic","make","fun","watchbr","br","re","look","lowgrad","slasher","movi","twist","psycholog","horror","dash","campi","ridicul","pop","bowl","popcorn","invit","friend","funbr","br","agre","comment","sound","veri","bad","dialog","next","imposs","follow","much","time","soundtrack","kind"],"filtered2":["mani","problem","associ","make","come","like","low","budget","class","project","someon","school","give","credit","campi","though","mani","time","throughout","find","laugh","hyster","bad","time","comic","make","fun","watchbr","re","look","lowgrad","slasher","twist","psycholog","horror","dash","campi","ridicul","pop","bowl","popcorn","invit","friend","funbr","agre","comment","sound","veri","bad","dialog","next","imposs","follow","time","soundtrack","kind"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,8,9,15,16,30,34,38,50,68,83,86,122,133,139,161,167,178,217,256,259,260,274,280,296,297,356,432,435,438,480,622,628,659,731,796,901,952,1734,1742,1851,1916,2097,2755,3204,3205,3225,4504,7534],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,8,9,15,16,30,34,38,50,68,83,86,122,133,139,161,167,178,217,256,259,260,274,280,296,297,356,432,435,438,480,622,628,659,731,796,901,952,1734,1742,1851,1916,2097,2755,3204,3205,3225,4504,7534],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,2.825681057716235,2.1367141713444147,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,3.43598877114071,2.0064197866819473,2.292318797740072,2.031112399272319,2.2489347673732487,2.3212364753796515,2.2939035841256437,2.4323182980210873,2.4609576687888097,2.532833256045391,2.6113665294700725,2.748952192422636,2.7464553122240485,2.6754694156628323,2.748952192422636,2.8028805344481915,2.9504565686333644,2.813490713560207,3.028335462059722,3.235085203598255,3.2829611516442836,3.1797351085150902,3.43462735814388,3.4933926673701317,3.607563812710113,3.6405503117064195,4.096025840389245,3.850067611308864,3.8962296530720266,3.9868265484242533,9.597669863721855,4.724033718778229,4.900964426937307,4.869215728622727,4.9676558014359795,5.3560264761848435,5.583416318380505,5.482320201509136,5.541743621979936,6.032366538428407,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247362E-4,2.154078066332399E-4,2.154609924846838E-4,2.1541767793321656E-4,2.1543806466120744E-4,2.1540661893957883E-4,2.154736133886264E-4,2.1537456994793312E-4,2.1540785215747773E-4,2.1563045283100644E-4,2.1734141771275804E-4,2.1540820795554655E-4,2.1561221314088622E-4,2.1563467621359272E-4,2.1553671901055054E-4,2.154185264322715E-4,2.1549263873662996E-4,2.1559405030503596E-4,2.1542964756197317E-4,2.1542885992980747E-4,2.1562267093784906E-4,2.154504437022088E-4,2.154507697677838E-4,2.1558878983769222E-4,2.154297252728716E-4,2.1563725358021157E-4,2.154836357275369E-4,2.1540732385964904E-4,2.1550498033487078E-4,2.1557075556130384E-4,2.1545150052150504E-4,2.155668916533927E-4,2.1567272961560587E-4,2.158729073506163E-4,2.1548326336575627E-4,2.154183957775203E-4,2.1549606627473255E-4,2.154402735272825E-4,2.153747998203633E-4,2.1542958084691706E-4,2.156454781016616E-4,2.1552718298266577E-4,2.1556738289319746E-4,2.1538551900010988E-4,2.1542963562520205E-4,2.154183147719786E-4,2.1549123191840145E-4,2.1552859836735782E-4,2.1548477184478568E-4,2.1545061712774068E-4,2.1541884748491814E-4,2.158602057199361E-4,2.1547305307223887E-4,2.1542958624900306E-4,2.1547189913423298E-4,2.154075442506242E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476604E-4,2.1541914990540824E-4,2.1540742129050466E-4,2.1557975239475932E-4,2.154932132780453E-4,2.154073312445466E-4,2.15385431247179E-4,2.1536377186288146E-4,2.1555849480439057E-4,2.1541788389

{"value":"Unbelievably awful film. I watched part of this on T.V. recently. My jaw dropped as I watched a horrendously conceived plot and listened to mind-numbing drivel. Not a single line from the master of one-liners could come close to producing anything resembling a chuckle. It was so bad it made me want to exhume Rodney Dangerfield's body, slap him around and scream, \"How could you?\" I know many films are done in haste, hoping to cash in on the popularity of a given actor or theme. But please, Hollywood, show a little respect for your audience. It's sad and scary that people were expected to pay to see such tripe.

{"value":"Now for the truth, its very very weak storyline - for a Walt Disney film its total rubbish. When the robinson appear, the films all over the place, I was shocked how poor it was. It like \"alice in wonderland\" gone wrong!. It feels like they were short on ideas some mashed some crazy rubbish together to try and get away with it - and they don't. After that, I sat there wishing for the end. My younger brother lost interest half way through and was confused by the story. The characters are weak and after the robinsons appear you don't care about the ending, you just want the film to finish. Its a film to forget, and forget quickly. If you've got some spare time, don't waste it on

{"value":"This movie was so terrible it was almost good... almost. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who can't sing or dance, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too. <br /><br />The plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music. Admittadly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a good way).<br /><br />Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful!

{"value":"This piece of filth is virtually impossible to follow. The sound is crap the picture quality goes from bad to worse to good to bad again! Things happen for no apparent reason characters appear and disappear. Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during its production?<br /><br />Poor film making aside, the story is vile just sick evil sh*t If you like rape, murder and self harm this is right up your alley. And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough you can enjoy clips of actual people being executed. I watched almost all of it but had to turn off after I seen someones brains blown out.

{"value":"The only reason I DVRd this movie was because 1. I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2. I've always heard how awful it was. The movie did not disappoint. The best parts were Shaq's outfits. The worst parts were, well, just about everything else. My 12 year old son and I just squirmed and couldn't look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why Max didn't wish for Kazzam to fix that front tooth of his! But for all it's terribleness we just couldn't stop watching it, the story sucked you in, like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit, it was hypnotic.

{"value":"This really is the worst film I have ever seen. Ever. Period. I actually paid £3.50 to watch this steaming turd of a movie.

I would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again.<br /><br />This should be cast into IMDb's bottom 100.

{"value":"Weak Bobby \"Pineapple Salsa\" Flay and Mario Batali bring this down.<br /><br />Flay being the worst. Definitely a one trick pony, I think they could have gotten other American chefs to come to the table on this one as the Iron Chefs. The kind of dishes this duo come up with really...don't reflect on the creativity of the original Iron Chef Series. I don't think Batali even went to chef school, actually. There are a lot of great chefs in America, I just wonder why they don't appear on the Food Network.<br /><br />It would also help to have more regional ingredients and perhaps co-hosts who can handle the pressure. I like Alton Brown, but he is a bit too flippant/funny for this role.","finished_norm":["weak","bobbi","pineappl","salsa","flai","and","mario","batali","bring","thi","downbr","br","flai","be","the","wrong","definit","a","on","trick","poni","i","think","thei","can","have","get","other","american","chef","to","come","to","the","tabl","on","thi","on","a","the","iron","chef","the","kind","of","dish","thi","duo","come","up","with","reallydont","reflect","on","the","creativ","of","the","origin","iron","chef","seri","i","do","not","think","batali","even","go","to","chef","school","actual","there","be","a","lot","of","great","chef","in","america","i","just","wonder","why","thei","do","not","appear","on","the","food","networkbr","br","it","would","conjur","help","to","have","much","region","ingredi","and","perhap","cohost","who","can","handl","the","pressur","i","like","alton","brown","but","he","be","a","bite","too","flippantfunni","for","thi","role"],"filtered":["weak","bobbi","pineappl","salsa","flai","mario","batali","bring","thi","downbr","br","flai","wrong","definit","trick","poni","think","thei","get","american","chef","come","tabl","thi","iron","chef","kind","dish","thi","duo","come","reallydont","reflect","creativ","origin","iron","chef","seri","think","batali","even","go","chef","school","actual","lot","great","chef","america","wonder","thei","appear","food","networkbr","br","conjur","help","much","region","ingredi","perhap","cohost","handl","pressur","like","alton","brown","bite","flippantfunni","thi","role"],"filtered2":["weak","bobbi","pineappl","salsa","flai","mario","batali","bring","downbr","flai","wrong","definit","trick","poni","think","get","american","chef","come","tabl","iron","chef","kind","dish","duo","come","reallydont","reflect","creativ","origin","iron","chef","think","batali","even","go","chef","school","actual","lot","great","chef","america","wonder","appear","food","networkbr","conjur","help","region","ingredi","perhap","cohost","handl","pressur","like","alton","brown","bite","flippantfunni","role"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,6,12,25,34,39,51,52,69,72,122,128,154,170,175,185,223,250,296,318,379,392,808,945,1125,1246,1390,1437,1842,1953,2005,2770,3138,3387,3569,3871,3909,3975,4065,5122,7872],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,6,12,25,34,39,51,52,69,72,122,128,154,170,175,185,223,250,296,318,379,392,808,945,1125,1246,1390,1437,1842,1953,2005,2770,3138,3387,3569,3871,3909,3975,4065,5122,7872],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,2.133457220525776,1.2796387880827016,2.7965700178917925,1.5538940054862738,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,2.127032521151058,1.9209463754160525,2.2489347673732487,2.3409902041158843,2.348499626138016,2.4214486257841834,2.3791142619576227,2.518833027372001,2.825563294794476,2.6812935439488212,2.9504565686333644,2.902686292364678,3.1272886331425473,3.0670934723591254,3.90413483257914,3.9782428047328615,4.251780369798478,8.631140215347616,4.456830177669989,4.4919214974812585,4.828393734102471,5.014723312293965,4.9227044135737135,5.626901430320244,5.5623629091826725,5.5623629091826725,5.719991853386255,5.878215858601149,5.770002273960917,6.101359409915359,5.878215858601149,32.18915823268286,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006066E-4,2.4075667160687803E-4,2.4081611628889928E-4,2.407677045465099E-4,2.4079049035382463E-4,2.407553441472228E-4,2.408302224017342E-4,2.4071952367870044E-4,2.4075672248833935E-4,2.4100551847254184E-4,2.429178271189801E-4,2.4075712015618692E-4,2.409851323632679E-4,2.4101023885640487E-4,2.409007541978265E-4,2.407686528956506E-4,2.4085148662392325E-4,2.409648321523582E-4,2.407810827430797E-4,2.407802024235517E-4,2.4099682081796445E-4,2.408043261416531E-4,2.4080469057813193E-4,2.4095895264117164E-4,2.4078116959887915E-4,2.4101311952363027E-4,2.4084142415433326E-4,2.4075613202122098E-4,2.4086528056278372E-4,2.409387961184069E-4,2.4080550732584615E-4,2.409344775116553E-4,2.4105277032522763E-4,2.4127650467341201E-4,2.4084100797358134E-4,2.4076850686564587E-4,2.4085531750952708E-4,2.407929591559195E-4,2.407197806021706E-4,2.4078100817709667E-4,2.410223118943285E-4,2.4089009598459934E-4,2.4093502655981748E-4,2.4073176119878166E-4,2.407810694016074E-4,2.4076841632749452E-4,2.4084991425345282E-4,2.408916779296218E-4,2.40842693968142E-4,2.4080451997563935E-4,2.4076901172928727E-4,2.4126230833403908E-4,2.4082959614816143E-4,2.4078101421489198E-4,2.4082830641647583E-4,2.4075637834747286E-4,0.9809713522425241,2.4079394036305142E-4,2.4076934973816337E-4,2.4075624091759236E-4,2.4094885168561962E-4,2.408521287765036E-4,2.4075614027516213E-4,2.4073166311921858E-4,2.4070745489132732E-4,2.4092509253415917E-4,2.4076793474448382E-4,2.4087737889248641E-4,2.4094807029668796E-4,2.4083875684592336E-4,2.4078133312136903E-4,

{"value":"I think it's time John Rambo move on with his life and try to put Vietnam behind him. This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer. Ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies. Vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly I am tired of Hollywood making it seem like it was. This is not the worst of the films concerning Vietnam, that honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets. In any case John Rambo carrying around a 50 cal Machine Gun taking on what seems to be half of the Viet Cong army plus a good many Russians is an insult to watch.

{"value":"If I could give it a zero, I'd change my mind and give it a -10 instead. Absolutely horrible movie with no movie plot, doesn't make sense of what is happening. Just PLAIN BORING. Please don't waste your money on this one. Pleaseee!!! This movie could have done so well if it truly depicted the real zodiac killer's story, but nopes, I didn't feel anything but disgust while watching it. Do yourself a favor and rent some classic movies instead, its better to watch a movie you've already seen like 3-4 times than watch this crap! I don't understand why people even bother to make such movies when they know its not going to do well.

{"value":"The plot was quite interesting, with the Russian revolution background. I also enjoyed seeing Budapest as the movie was partly filmed there. Sadly, there was zero chemistry between the 2 main characters so it was hard to believe the love story between them. The love scenes were forced and mechanical. Jordan kirckland was really stiff, almost icy. Rob Stewart was quite charming and boyish, so she looked like his older sister rather than his girlfriend. The ending, when we finally figure out who was actually after them, was quite weak and made no sense whatsoever. I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot better if the relationship between the 2 actors was slightly more

{"value":"As a fan of the Sookie Stackhouse books, I find this series to be a totally crass representation of them. Vampire Bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book. I found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar. One of the things I loved about the books is that despite all the crap that she is going through Sookie is always a lady, and yet in the TV series she doesn't seem like that at all. Not only that but the prejudices displayed in the TV series are not nearly as wide spread in the books. I didn't expect an exact replica of the books but I at least expected the feel of them to be used for the series.","finished_norm":["a","a","fan","of","the","sooki","stackhous","book","i","find","thi","seri","to","be","a","total","crass","represent","of","them","vampir","bill","be","not","veri","good","look","and","look","much","old","than","describ","in","the","book","i","find","that","thei","have","make","alreadi","wonderfulli","colour","charact","seem","veri","cours","and","vulgar","on","of","the","thing","i","love","about","the","book","be","that","despit","all","the","crap","that","she","be","go","through","sooki","be","alwai","a","ladi","and","yet","in","the","tv","seri","she","doe","not","seem","like","that","at","all","not","onli","that","but","the","prejudic","displai","in","the","tv","seri","be","not","nearli","a","wide","spread","in","the","book","i","do","not","expect","a","exact","replica","of","the","book","but","i","at","littl","expect","the","feel","of","them","to","be","us","for","the","seri"],"filtered":["fan","sooki","stackhous","book","find","thi","seri","total","crass","represent","vampir","bill","veri","good","look","look","much","old","describ","book","find","thei","make","alreadi","wonderfulli","colour","charact","seem","veri","cours","vulgar","thing","love","book","despit","crap","go","sooki","alwai","ladi","yet","tv","seri","doe","seem","like","onli","prejudic","displai","tv","seri","nearli","wide","spread","book","expect","exact","replica","book","littl","expect","feel","us","seri"],"filtered2":["fan","sooki","stackhous","book","find","total","crass","represent","vampir","bill","veri","good","look","look","old","describ","book","find","make","alreadi","wonderfulli","colour","charact","seem","veri","cours","vulgar","thing","love","book","despit","crap","go","sooki","alwai","ladi","yet","tv","doe","seem","like","onli","prejudic","displai","tv","nearli","wide","spread","book","expect","exact","replica","book","littl","expect","feel","us"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,10,11,14,15,16,18,29,35,38,43,54,56,67,130,140,151,172,184,194,197,199,313,330,391,472,485,611,668,722,1063,1582,1721,2334,2764,2838,3760,4230,4343,5173],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,10,11,14,15,16,18,29,35,38,43,54,56,67,130,140,151,172,184,194,197,199,313,330,391,472,485,611,668,722,1063,1582,1721,2334,2764,2838,3760,4230,4343,5173],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,2.393227744058217,1.2153159934048174,1.3195384777338066,2.926338025798268,3.038623282696244,1.6608112036218214,1.8113893252729412,1.8610609350701788,1.9570915389266579,4.528427806839927,2.317169775997098,14.001227434050932,5.000281788719697,2.496249838866882,2.5378812223426954,2.558331832813986,2.558331832813986,2.907069060519773,2.9292757465539174,3.109204957709252,3.4222967456864013,4.160564361526816,3.520060914452293,3.5813614403160887,3.850067611308864,4.100845126825194,4.621379564718146,4.760735085628657,5.214056214914456,5.390512652256013,5.373120909544144,5.7446844659766265,5.907203395474402,6.0662680901040895,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255694E-4,2.2737792632708252E-4,2.2743406769354583E-4,2.2738834617097738E-4,2.2740986578072416E-4,2.2737667263379266E-4,2.274473899357231E-4,2.273428426933872E-4,2.273779743810828E-4,2.2761294487884262E-4,2.2941898734736603E-4,2.2737834995069814E-4,2.2759369161694278E-4,2.276174029529931E-4,2.2751400231007E-4,2.2738924182076192E-4,2.274674725141789E-4,2.275745194800718E-4,2.2740098094688508E-4,2.274001495463368E-4,2.2760473054921052E-4,2.2742293271973998E-4,2.2742327690463955E-4,2.2756896669080747E-4,2.274010629761449E-4,2.276201235427727E-4,2.2745796921172076E-4,2.273774167259697E-4,2.27480499929756E-4,2.2754993025739267E-4,2.2742404826603258E-4,2.2754585163377135E-4,2.276575709662823E-4,2.2786887249241975E-4,2.2745757615795522E-4,2.2738910390558207E-4,2.2747109051910803E-4,2.274121973925424E-4,2.2734308533973E-4,2.2740091052450182E-4,2.2762880509736246E-4,2.2750393636919382E-4,2.2754637017156196E-4,2.2735440017971096E-4,2.274009683467927E-4,2.2738901839859709E-4,2.274659875196631E-4,2.275054304062079E-4,2.2745916846251917E-4,2.2742311578245451E-4,2.2738958071416685E-4,2.278554650375546E-4,2.2744679848279355E-4,2.2740091622677948E-4,2.2744558042094617E-4,2.273776493639771E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441363E-4,2.2738989994003424E-4,2.273775195710163E-4,2.275594270410357E-4,2.2746807898261497E-4,2.2737742452124285E-4,2.2735430755038724E-4,2.2733144456336707E-4,2.2753698817546113E-4,2.2738856357694832E-4,2.2749192596045102E-4,2.2755868907355282E-4,2.274554501244985E-4,2.2740121741175994E-4,2.2735460559673433E-4,2.274127671055134E-4,2.273544831407279E-4,2.2736641433631505E-4,2.2735461203143633E-4,2.275021969452386E-4,2.2

{"value":"This is the best film the Derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven't seen any of the others. There are the usual ingredients: it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts, we can watch Bo disrobing or auditioning for wet T-shirt contests quite frequently, the story is just laughably idiotic, and the film takes itself much too seriously. And then: Orang Utans in Africa?<br /><br />But it has a few things going for it. Bo looks great, the production values (sets, costumes, etc.) are quite good, and this greatly enhances its camp value. In a strange way it is actually quite funny, simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","well","film","the","derek","coupl","have","ever","make","and","if","you","think","thi","be","a","recommend","then","you","have","not","see","ani","of","the","other","there","be","the","usual","ingredi","it","be","just","a","poorli","act","a","their","other","effort","we","can","watch","bo","disrob","or","audit","for","wet","tshirt","contest","quit","frequent","the","stori","be","just","laughabl","idiot","and","the","film","take","itself","much","too","serious","and","then","orang","utan","in","africabr","br","but","it","have","a","few","thing","go","for","it","bo","look","great","the","product","valu","set","costum","etc","be","quit","good","and","thi","greatli","enhanc","it","camp","valu","in","a","strang","wai","it","be","actual","quit","funni","simpli","becaus","it","try","to","be","seriou","and","fail","so","badli"],"filtered":["thi","well","film","derek","coupl","ever","make","think","thi","recommend","see","ani","usual","ingredi","poorli","act","effort","watch","bo","disrob","audit","wet","tshirt","contest","quit","frequent","stori","laughabl","idiot","film","take","much","serious","orang","utan","africabr","br","thing","go","bo","look","great","product","valu","set","costum","etc","quit","good","thi","greatli","enhanc","camp","valu","strang","wai","actual","quit","funni","simpli","becaus","try","seriou","fail","badli"],"filtered2":["well","derek","coupl","ever","make","think","recommend","see","ani","usual","ingredi","poorli","act","effort","watch","bo","disrob","audit","wet","tshirt","contest","quit","frequent","stori","laughabl","idiot","take","serious","orang","utan","africabr","thing","go","bo","look","great","product","valu","set","costum","etc","quit","good","greatli","enhanc","camp","valu","strang","wai","actual","quit","funni","simpli","becaus","try","seriou","fail","badli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,12,16,17,20,21,22,27,29,31,33,36,44,51,52,62,109,120,190,201,215,253,265,298,371,398,401,417,429,448,451,493,552,705,776,908,1671,1763,1908,1937,2735,3090,3138,3245,3266,3275,6250,8172],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,12,16,17,20,21,22,27,29,31,33,36,44,51,52,62,109,120,190,201,215,253,265,298,371,398,401,417,429,448,451,493,552,705,776,908,1671,1763,1908,1937,2735,3090,3138,3245,3266,3275,6250,8172],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.604729392502474,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,2.0226120445069267,2.125691139326857,6.613350126891784,2.558331832813986,2.561435818751577,2.605934685587711,2.7073305177318163,2.73529586597515,2.7819920465008363,3.0466846007279185,3.143848349181566,3.0879275592619675,3.1932880749197934,3.2872346624216657,3.2681460658591432,6.433915638011396,3.342254038012865,3.424750734647968,3.6590123745461547,3.770603439954617,4.081705786614497,10.712052952369687,4.74221603786142,5.390512652256013,5.501738287366237,5.5623629091826725,5.426230734858092,5.5623629091826725,5.719991853386255,5.541743621979936,5.5623629091826725,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247395E-4,2.1540780663324022E-4,2.1546099248468412E-4,2.154176779332169E-4,2.1543806466120774E-4,2.1540661893957916E-4,2.1547361338862672E-4,2.1537456994793344E-4,2.1540785215747805E-4,2.1563045283100674E-4,2.173414177127582E-4,2.1540820795554687E-4,2.1561221314088654E-4,2.1563467621359304E-4,2.1553671901055086E-4,2.1541852643227181E-4,2.1549263873663028E-4,2.1559405030503628E-4,2.154296475619735E-4,2.154288599298078E-4,2.156226709378494E-4,2.1545044370220912E-4,2.1545076976778413E-4,2.1558878983769255E-4,2.1542972527287193E-4,2.156372535802119E-4,2.1548363572753722E-4,2.1540732385964936E-4,2.155049803348711E-4,2.1557075556130417E-4,2.1545150052150537E-4,2.1556689165339304E-4,2.156727296156062E-4,2.1587290735061663E-4,2.154832633657566E-4,2.1541839577752064E-4,2.1549606627473285E-4,2.1544027352728284E-4,2.153747998203636E-4,2.1542958084691739E-4,2.1564547810166192E-4,2.155271829826661E-4,2.1556738289319778E-4,2.153855190001102E-4,2.1542963562520237E-4,2.1541831477197893E-4,2.1549123191840177E-4,2.1552859836735814E-4,2.15484771844786E-4,2.15450617127741E-4,2.1541884748491847E-4,2.1586020571993643E-4,2.154730530722392E-4,2.154295862490034E-4,2.154718991342333E-4,2.1540754425062453E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476633E-4,2.1541914990540857E-4,2.1540742129050498E-4,2.1557975239475965E-4,2.1549321327804562E-4,2.154073312445469E-4,2.153854312471793E-4,2.153637718628818E-4,2.155584948043

{"value":"This was a cute movie until the ending. The ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense. The girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive/aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who ultimately yielded his power and control over the relationship to her. It is not by chance that she was sitting behind the driver's wheel in the car as they drove away at the end after he had to beg her and plead with her to take him back. This movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them. It was a despicable movie for that reason.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","cute","movi","until","the","end","the","end","be","mere","on","much","despic","effort","to","emascul","man","and","empow","woman","at","their","expens","the","girl","refus","to","listen","to","reason","and","logic","and","us","her","passiveaggress","natur","to","control","and","impos","her","will","on","the","gui","who","ultim","yield","hi","power","and","control","over","the","relationship","to","her","it","be","not","by","chanc","that","she","be","sit","behind","the","driver","wheel","in","the","car","a","thei","drive","awai","at","the","end","after","he","have","to","beg","her","and","plead","with","her","to","take","him","back","thi","movi","be","a","victori","for","all","woman","who","think","thei","should","be","in","charg","of","all","man","and","in","control","of","their","relationship","with","them","it","be","a","despic","movi","for","that","reason"],"filtered":["thi","cute","movi","end","end","mere","much","despic","effort","emascul","man","empow","woman","expens","girl","refus","listen","reason","logic","us","passiveaggress","natur","control","impos","gui","ultim","yield","hi","power","control","relationship","chanc","sit","behind","driver","wheel","car","thei","drive","awai","end","beg","plead","take","back","thi","movi","victori","woman","think","thei","charg","man","control","relationship","despic","movi","reason"],"filtered2":["cute","end","end","mere","despic","effort","emascul","man","empow","woman","expens","girl","refus","listen","reason","logic","us","passiveaggress","natur","control","impos","gui","ultim","yield","power","control","relationship","chanc","sit","behind","driver","wheel","car","drive","awai","end","beg","plead","take","back","victori","woman","think","charg","man","control","relationship","despic","reason"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,24,31,45,55,56,63,70,84,95,155,244,284,365,393,401,456,461,486,577,735,824,837,845,855,973,1522,1545,1735,1743,1966,2904,4275,4901,4959,5492],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,24,31,45,55,56,63,70,84,95,155,244,284,365,393,401,456,461,486,577,735,824,837,845,855,973,1522,1545,1735,1743,1966,2904,4275,4901,4959,5492],"values":[1.066728610262888,3.9631084698357775,1.4070669811451506,3.632592212924433,1.9536997889255368,1.8610609350701788,1.8729627573220065,4.189351572503368,2.2212694515902225,4.064665311355097,2.3074766467914385,2.634508058031767,3.110998680163279,3.185521045582134,3.120015873813468,3.0879275592619675,3.3001658770939146,3.358217889001879,3.3066947359763783,7.209236604960712,3.7132521434831514,11.724332942876337,3.8463152616903136,3.831445099210862,3.9201351739255808,4.072271754381138,4.550761997504193,4.581533656170946,4.911775343041523,4.724033718778229,4.85885294158718,5.5623629091826725,11.874112717248165,6.1754673820690815,6.137727054086234,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6717037937823456E-4,2.6693362619818376E-4,2.6699953417250584E-4,2.6694585872558954E-4,2.6697112198467926E-4,2.6693215440669804E-4,2.6701517401262094E-4,2.6689243925574925E-4,2.669336826118768E-4,2.672095296478217E-4,2.693297594915465E-4,2.669341235172933E-4,2.6718692700077463E-4,2.672147632688599E-4,2.6709337457905813E-4,2.669469101866907E-4,2.6703875024790995E-4,2.67164419591636E-4,2.669606915046712E-4,2.669597154698961E-4,2.671998863159869E-4,2.66986462107932E-4,2.669868661688046E-4,2.671579008138558E-4,2.669607878041147E-4,2.672179571448311E-4,2.6702759370766444E-4,2.6693302794453987E-4,2.670540439720465E-4,2.6713555271576475E-4,2.6698777171973943E-4,2.671307645561984E-4,2.67261919092724E-4,2.6750997959492046E-4,2.6702713227647534E-4,2.6694674827915793E-4,2.670429976574582E-4,2.669738592143109E-4,2.6689272411395523E-4,2.669606088312893E-4,2.672281489822056E-4,2.670815575212523E-4,2.671313733011852E-4,2.669060073350434E-4,2.6696067671260935E-4,2.669466478969883E-4,2.670370069169834E-4,2.670833114677514E-4,2.670290015855949E-4,2.6698667701707026E-4,2.6694730803553617E-4,2.6749423971813007E-4,2.6701447966784547E-4,2.6696061552556114E-4,2.670130497064103E-4,2.6693330105331483E-4,0.9789024083376443,2.669749471059819E-4,2.6694768279538964E-4,2.6693314868097927E-4,2.671467016031524E-4,2.670394622203579E-4,2.6693303709591425E-4,2.6690589859150053E-4,2.668790582551073E-4,2.671203591703035E-4,2.669461139524936E-4,2.670674577270919E-4,2.6714583525548445E-4,2.6702463638855344E-4,2.6696096910605284E-4,2.669062484873479E-4,2.6697452803714565E-4,2.6690610472833676E-4,2.6692011152906016E-4,2.6690625604146E-4,2.67079515499182E-4,2.670000240882529E-4,2.66933393382811E-4,2.669592508861751E-4]}}

{"value":"Bad. Bad. Bad. Those three lines sum up this crappy little film that can only attract idiot children and their parents to the cinema. and its... #1 Movie in America! What is this country thinking? Mike Myers looking more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chineese lady that falls asleep within 3 minutes. A lame plot with dirty jokes. It's grotesuque and awful. When Green-Eggs and Ham comes out in 2005 I'll be so happy! (not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan will probably play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham. They'll try to chase Sam-I-Am and that mean guy who are running away with it. (I hope they don't ruin the classic book.)

As I recall, the film's producers and director were in attendance, presumably to gage our reaction.<br /><br />Many scenes evoked gales of laughter from the audience, which would have been fine if it had been a comedy, but it was supposed to be a horror film.<br /><br />If the audience wasn't scared, it seems the filmmakers were. They delayed release for over a year. Out of curiosity I saw it again to see if they'd re-cut it; as far as I can tell, they hadn't. It was the same lousy movie, just a year older.<br /><br />It almost qualifies as \"so bad, it's good,\" but it's slow-paced and boring.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","film","at","a","prereleas","screen","at","the","writer","guild","theater","in","beverli","hill","a","i","recal","the","film","produc","and","director","be","in","attend","presum","to","gage","our","reactionbr","br","mani","scene","evok","gale","of","laughter","from","the","audienc","which","would","have","be","fine","if","it","have","be","a","comedi","but","it","be","suppos","to","be","a","horror","filmbr","br","if","the","audienc","be","not","scare","it","seem","the","filmmak","be","thei","delai","releas","for","over","a","year","out","of","curios","i","see","it","again","to","see","if","thei","have","recut","it","a","far","a","i","can","tell","thei","have","not","it","be","the","same","lousi","movi","just","a","year","olderbr","br","it","almost","qualifi","a","so","bad","it","good","but","it","slowpac","and","bore"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","prereleas","screen","writer","guild","theater","beverli","hill","recal","film","produc","director","attend","presum","gage","reactionbr","br","mani","scene","evok","gale","laughter","audienc","fine","comedi","suppos","horror","filmbr","br","audienc","scare","seem","filmmak","thei","delai","releas","year","curios","see","see","thei","recut","far","tell","thei","lousi","movi","year","olderbr","br","almost","qualifi","bad","good","slowpac","bore"],"filtered2":["see","prereleas","screen","writer","guild","theater","beverli","hill","recal","produc","director","attend","presum","gage","reactionbr","mani","scene","evok","gale","laughter","audienc","fine","comedi","suppos","horror","filmbr","audienc","scare","seem","filmmak","delai","releas","year","curios","see","see","recut","far","tell","lousi","year","olderbr","almost","qualifi","bad","good","slowpac","bore"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,9,19,35,50,57,58,83,90,101,108,127,131,149,168,192,261,287,323,327,424,464,566,623,1018,1116,1607,1703,1733,1871,2465,2524,3195,3788,5233,6479,7663],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,9,19,35,50,57,58,83,90,101,108,127,131,149,168,192,261,287,323,327,424,464,566,623,1018,1116,1607,1703,1733,1871,2465,2524,3195,3788,5233,6479,7663],"values":[1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,1.0683570856722073,1.312380678011735,1.463169012899134,1.717994385570355,3.668325173349496,1.865701314626681,2.292318797740072,2.0477128419653545,2.098582041218749,2.138507503627933,2.4359679371086367,2.2512118082053005,2.3253197803590226,4.978953423722071,2.5318267134339894,2.7085302779237206,2.841890188081905,3.0433232530252132,2.9674191958529437,3.212973749990824,3.2872346624216657,3.439602492783994,3.607563812710113,4.268777946167049,4.224077767249142,4.597282013139085,4.6973654716960676,4.760735085628657,4.890269137820559,5.129498826886393,5.170884043049248,5.521540914662417,5.7959777603641776,6.255510089742618,6.868614562629026,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.8581607958720596E-4,2.855628035095607E-4,2.8563331117166795E-4,2.855758897395339E-4,2.856029161100747E-4,2.8556122900241137E-4,2.856500425091668E-4,2.855187421490004E-4,2.855628638603399E-4,2.8585796213644E-4,2.8812616186412354E-4,2.855633355363465E-4,2.8583378206085557E-4,2.858635610095286E-4,2.8573370065784553E-4,2.855770145816308E-4,2.856752641192772E-4,2.8580970386979024E-4,2.855917576915739E-4,2.855907135397723E-4,2.858476458008282E-4,2.856193268136066E-4,2.8561975907370513E-4,2.8580273014945054E-4,2.8559186071171216E-4,2.8586697778466255E-4,2.856633289691227E-4,2.85562163504065E-4,2.8569162518551954E-4,2.857788223876789E-4,2.856207278226311E-4,2.8577370006461713E-4,2.8591400781705984E-4,2.861793803497606E-4,2.856628353348591E-4,2.8557684137464433E-4,2.8567980795362105E-4,2.856058443697271E-4,2.85519046887332E-4,2.8559166924845404E-4,2.8587788090576806E-4,2.857210588929082E-4,2.857743512936419E-4,2.855332571384255E-4,2.855917418671807E-4,2.855767339868484E-4,2.85673399122072E-4,2.857229352465419E-4,2.8566483510221853E-4,2.856195567211567E-4,2.855774401961676E-4,2.861625419940721E-4,2.856492997063828E-4,2.855916764099161E-4,2.8564776994858437E-4,2.855624556729781E-4,0.9774300169363854,2.856070081848669E-4,2.8557784111034215E-4,2.85562292666646E-4,2.857907493508861E-4,2.85676025779961E-4,2.8556217329410964E-4,2.8553314080571987E-4,2.8550442729436223E-4,2.857625684915364E-4,2.8557616277860836E-4,2.8570597508047624E-4,2.8578982254120534E-4,2.856601652600455E-4,2.8559205466663075E-4,2.8553351512064057E-4,2.856065598694057E-4,2.8553336132875287E-4,2.855483456577778E-4,2.855335232019507E-4,2.8571887435903913E-4,2.856338352784139E-4,2.855625544461081E-4,2.8559021653296317E-4]}}

Goldberg was cool, he does his famous move-forgot what its called cause i don't watch wrestling-sucks. VD & Goldberg had some good fights. It was the ending like the 1st but just not that good. VD does his best move in his career, like always-the HELICOPTER KICK. Even though, the final ending should've been longer.

{"value":"Watch the 1936 version. As personally annoying I find Charles Boyer's voice, he's more of a match to pay cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf--I mean Omar Sharif tries but, no--too cute and vibrant.

She looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion.<br /><br />The only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they're playing is Ava Gardner whose

It will not only make you bang your head on the table as why can't bollywood even make a good remake; but also annoy you with the so called funny moments in it. The charm of the movie is missing. Ranee looks terrible. Saif tries to act like he is one hell of an actor. The plots that have been picked up from the original, don't look effective either. The part where both of them bring their friends along and they hit a note, it just doesn't look appealing. What can be more disastrous? you wanna waste some money, this is what you can get. Otherwise, put some more bucks, and watch the original.

{"value":"this movie was horrible. I could barely stay awake through it. I would never see this movie again if I were payed to. The so-called horror scenes in it were increadably predictable and over played. There was really nothing about this movie that would have made it original or worth the $7.50 I payed to see it. Don't go see it, don't rent it, don't read about it online because any of these things would be a complete waste of your time. Sarah Michelle Geller gave a lackluster performance and really should be ashamed of herself for sullying her good name with this movie. Shame on you Sarah for being associated with this horrible, horrible movie.

{"value":"Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. However, I feel that he sold out in order to gain his first big budget lead role. Foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents wasted by stereotyping producers who think black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (See: Money Talks, Blue Streak).<br /><br />Okay I laughed a few times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, but I would love to see these guys branch out ala Marlon Wayans portrayal in Requiem to a Dream.

Bamboozled.","finished_norm":["jami","foxx","be","my","favorit","comedian","howev","i","feel","that","he","sell","out","in","order","to","gain","hi","big","budget","lead","role","foxx","follow","in","the","footstep","of","the","like","of","chri","tucker","martin","lawrenc","and","dave","chappl","who","have","all","see","their","talent","wast","by","stereotyp","produc","who","think","black","male","who","commit","pretti","crime","be","a","funni","concept","see","monei","talk","blue","streakbr","br","okai","i","laugh","a","few","time","and","grant","all","of","thi","comedian","continu","to","pick","up","hilari","role","but","i","would","love","to","see","thi","gui","branch","out","ala","marlon","wayan","portray","in","requiem","to","a","dream","or","in","live","color","tommi","davidson","and","damon","wayan","move","perform","in","spike","lee","satir","bamboozl"],"filtered":["jami","foxx","favorit","comedian","howev","feel","sell","order","gain","hi","big","budget","lead","role","foxx","follow","footstep","like","chri","tucker","martin","lawrenc","dave","chappl","see","talent","wast","stereotyp","produc","think","black","male","commit","pretti","crime","funni","concept","see","monei","talk","blue","streakbr","br","okai","laugh","time","grant","thi","comedian","continu","pick","hilari","role","love","see","thi","gui","branch","ala","marlon","wayan","portray","requiem","dream","live","color","tommi","davidson","damon","wayan","move","perform","spike","lee","satir","bamboozl"],"filtered2":["jami","foxx","favorit","comedian","howev","feel","sell","order","gain","big","budget","lead","role","foxx","follow","footstep","like","chri","tucker","martin","lawrenc","dave","chappl","see","talent","wast","stereotyp","produc","think","black","male","commit","pretti","crime","funni","concept","see","monei","talk","blue","streakbr","okai","laugh","time","grant","comedian","continu","pick","hilari","role","love","see","gui","branch","ala","marlon","wayan","portray","requiem","dream","live","color","tommi","davidson","damon","wayan","move","perform","spike","lee","satir","bamboozl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,12,43,54,55,62,78,82,89,105,113,116,126,128,133,157,186,191,229,256,260,261,275,276,433,439,446,570,604,607,632,649,725,753,822,861,875,969,1040,1066,1140,1233,1278,1422,1559,1633,1755,2591,2818,2968,3085,3260,3517,4032,4625,5458,5882,6003,7833],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,12,43,54,55,62,78,82,89,105,113,116,126,128,133,157,186,191,229,256,260,261,275,276,433,439,446,570,604,607,632,649,725,753,822,861,875,969,1040,1066,1140,1233,1278,1422,1559,1633,1755,2591,2818,2968,3085,3260,3517,4032,4625,5458,5882,6003,7833],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.6608112036218214,1.8113893252729412,1.9536997889255368,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,2.020196584395323,1.9940046109572438,2.1765612129984904,2.1521782565202803,2.2466628996789315,2.2391270689902285,4.681980408231769,2.3212364753796515,2.3360150694757706,2.571852579609833,2.5460113484259455,2.8432628718938773,2.748952192422636,2.6754694156628323,2.7085302779237206,2.7832848715031413,2.7884729505849193,3.164467636384302,3.2872346624216657,3.233054746047873,3.944626193933877,3.5727776966246974,3.68099128126493,3.541919708264792,3.6375061693251913,3.7034641371169887,3.8690435127678695,3.813163054373413,3.892300374932137,3.9282323841582003,4.0536665665501035,4.240607069200353,4.3095999406873045,4.558366596889411,4.470719289830655,4.535724120139652,4.484804029712395,4.573751515728891,9.656787468204943,4.715065048795469,5.501738287366237,5.672363804397,5.672363804397,12.064733076856815,5.719991853386255,12.978249881848246,6.137727054086234,6.214688095222362,6.389041482367141,6.489124940924123,6.437831646536572,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.807155861912872E-4,1.80555444974229E-4,1.8060002550835115E-4,1.805637191263483E-4,1.805808073405662E-4,1.805544494459758E-4,1.806106043864473E-4,1.8052758588871663E-4,1.8055548313277654E-4,1.8074206765953402E-4,1.8217620335957344E-4,1.805557813637443E-4,1.8072677909865354E-4,1.8074560771100238E-4,1.8066349970080465E-4,1.8056443034070407E-4,1.8062655148803227E-4,1.8071155495724383E-4,1.8057375210370463E-4,1.80573091908151E-4,1.8073554485423867E-4,1.8059118348844725E-4,1.8059145679755293E-4,1.807071456183398E-4,1.805738172412039E-4,1.8074776806713803E-4,1.8061900513983666E-4,1.8055504031201235E-4,1.806368962512834E-4,1.8069202923584195E-4,1.805920693174303E-4,1.8068879049708343E-4,1.8077750418235433E-4,1.8094529373735539E-4,1.8061869302511788E-4,1.8056432082551467E-4,1.8062942446035835E-4,1.8058265881848296E-4,1.8052777856845077E-4,1.8057369618295211E-4,1.807546618

{"value":"I have given this show (I have only watched seven episodes) four stars because most of her jokes/set-ups appear to fail.

Silverman throws out what she's got, including the kitchen sink, while she prays that a few things stick to the wall in her effort to be funny but different.<br /><br />However what she's \"got\"

{"value":"I read the reviews before i watched this movie, and i didn't believe them. I love crap movies and i expected this one to be average. It wasn't. This film makes Camp Blood 1 and 2 look like greats. The film contains bad acting, poor sound, poor confusing storyline, bad makeup- and it bored me so much i turned it off. even the nudity was rubbish! Did they even have a budget for this film? I don't think they did. You can tell if your gonna like this film or not in the first 5 minutes. if u want a good cheesy gory film go watch toxic avenger 4 or even camp blood.

{"value":"The animation was good, the imagery was good, although not totally original, however, the story was too long, way too confusing, and over the top dramatic. After about an hour I couldn't wait to get it over with. With so many characters that have nothing to contribute and plot elements that either come from nowhere or go nowhere this movie really wasn't one movie at all and would have been better of as a short series or possibly two movies. If you like this kind of typical story maybe you will like it, but frankly, I've been spoiled by much more creative stories that actually have some sort message to tell. Go rent a Miyazaki film and watch it twice, you'll get way more out of it.","finished_norm":["the","anim","be","good","the","imageri","be","good","although","not","total","origin","howev","the","stori","be","too","long","wai","too","confus","and","over","the","top","dramat","after","about","a","hour","i","can","not","wait","to","get","it","over","with","with","so","mani","charact","that","have","noth","to","contribut","and","plot","elem","that","either","come","from","nowher","or","go","nowher","thi","movi","realli","be","not","on","movi","at","all","and","would","have","be","well","of","a","a","short","seri","or","possibli","two","movi","if","you","like","thi","kind","of","typic","stori","mayb","you","will","like","it","but","frankli","i","have","be","spoil","by","much","much","creativ","stori","that","actual","have","some","sort","messag","to","tell","go","rend","a","miyazaki","film","and","watch","it","twice","you","will","get","wai","much","out","of","it"],"filtered":["anim","good","imageri","good","although","total","origin","howev","stori","long","wai","confus","top","dramat","hour","wait","get","mani","charact","noth","contribut","plot","elem","either","come","nowher","go","nowher","thi","movi","realli","movi","well","short","seri","possibli","two","movi","like","thi","kind","typic","stori","mayb","like","frankli","spoil","much","much","creativ","stori","actual","sort","messag","tell","go","rend","miyazaki","film","watch","twice","get","wai","much"],"filtered2":["anim","good","imageri","good","although","total","origin","howev","stori","long","wai","confus","top","dramat","hour","wait","get","mani","charact","noth","contribut","plot","elem","either","come","nowher","go","nowher","realli","well","short","possibli","two","like","kind","typic","stori","mayb","like","frankli","spoil","creativ","stori","actual","sort","messag","tell","go","rend","miyazaki","watch","twice","get","wai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,7,10,13,17,20,32,33,34,47,49,50,52,69,90,99,113,122,163,174,184,207,237,269,272,277,331,364,427,479,533,558,569,613,756,799,1125,1193,1255,1333,1894,2578],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,7,10,13,17,20,32,33,34,47,49,50,52,69,90,99,113,122,163,174,184,207,237,269,272,277,331,364,427,479,533,558,569,613,756,799,1125,1193,1255,1333,1894,2578],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,3.83116108203179,1.165345040023057,1.3711311285073675,2.803707089537043,1.3982850089458962,1.7064694353107215,1.6920303308087352,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,2.127032521151058,2.0477128419653545,2.056430207256609,2.1521782565202803,2.2489347673732487,2.4000574358028657,2.456282578459816,2.496249838866882,2.5531798379045583,2.640097787510554,2.76533567167316,2.8028805344481915,3.1163992333432793,2.932274249550174,2.9878441007049847,3.233054746047873,3.360519385990158,3.424750734647968,3.4572130107926293,3.6436037491933098,3.5364100524538222,3.7636829971100436,7.527365994220087,4.251780369798478,4.240607069200353,4.291900363587903,4.383707912841026,4.848596441419991,5.373120909544144]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125574E-4,2.27377926327083E-4,2.2743406769354632E-4,2.2738834617097787E-4,2.2740986578072462E-4,2.2737667263379315E-4,2.2744738993572358E-4,2.2734284269338768E-4,2.273779743810833E-4,2.276129448788431E-4,2.2941898734736652E-4,2.2737834995069863E-4,2.2759369161694327E-4,2.276174029529936E-4,2.275140023100705E-4,2.273892418207624E-4,2.2746747251417936E-4,2.275745194800723E-4,2.2740098094688557E-4,2.2740014954633725E-4,2.2760473054921098E-4,2.2742293271974046E-4,2.2742327690464E-4,2.2756896669080793E-4,2.274010629761454E-4,2.276201235427732E-4,2.2745796921172122E-4,2.2737741672597018E-4,2.2748049992975646E-4,2.2754993025739316E-4,2.2742404826603304E-4,2.2754585163377184E-4,2.2765757096628278E-4,2.2786887249242024E-4,2.274575761579557E-4,2.2738910390558256E-4,2.2747109051910852E-4,2.2741219739254287E-4,2.2734308533973045E-4,2.274009105245023E-4,2.2762880509736295E-4,2.275039363691943E-4,2.2754637017156245E-4,2.2735440017971145E-4,2.2740096834679318E-4,2.2738901839859757E-4,2.2746598751966355E-4,2.275054304062084E-4,2.2745916846251966E-4,2.27423115782455E-4,2.2738958071416733E-4,2.2785546503755507E-4,2.2744679848279403E-4,2.2740091622677994E-4,2.2744558042094663E-4,2.2737764936397756E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.274131240744141E-4,2.2738989994003473E-4,2.2737751957101676E-4,2.275594270410362E-4,2.2746807898261546E-4,2.2737742452124334E-4,2.2735430755038772E-4,2.2733144456336756E-4,2.275369881754616E-4,2.273885635769488E-4,2.274919259604515E-4,2.2755868907355328E-4,2.2745545012449895E-4,2.2740121741176043E-4,2.273546055967348E-4,2.274127671055139E-4,2.2735448314072838E-4,2.2736641433631553E-4,2.2735461203143682E-4,2.275021969452391
