{"value":"The Good Earth is not a great film by any means, it is way to ordinary. Maybe it was different in the 1930's but who would want to see the life of a farmer. It is not very interesting to me. Yes, Luis Rainer and Paul Muni do an excellent job acting but the film dragged on way too long. I could have told you the ending of this movie by the first act. In short Wang Lung (Muni) a small time farmer who does not want to be like his own father turns out exactly like him. Both falling in love with their wives just as they are on their death beds. The film does a complete 360 going from one generation to the next. Also this film did not have any good character actors or funny moments, it just was depressing stuff about lasting as a farmer during a time of crisis.","finished_norm":["the","good","earth","be","not","a","great","film","by","ani","mean","it","be","wai","to","ordinari","mayb","it","be","differ","in","the","but","who","would","want","to","see","the","life","of","a","farmer","it","be","not","veri","interest","to","me","ye","lui","rainer","and","paul","muni","do","a","excel","job","act","but","the","film","drag","on","wai","too","long","i","can","have","tell","you","the","end","of","thi","movi","by","the","act","in","short","wang","lung","muni","a","small","time","farmer","who","doe","not","want","to","be","like","hi","own","father","turn","out","exactli","like","him","both","fall","in","love","with","their","wife","just","a","thei","be","on","their","death","bed","the","film","doe","a","complet","go","from","on","gener","to","the","next","conjur","thi","film","do","not","have","ani","good","charact","actor","or","funni","moment","it","just","be","depress","stuff","about","last","a","a","farmer","dure","a","time","of","crisi"],"filtered":["good","earth","great","film","ani","mean","wai","ordinari","mayb","differ","want","see","life","farmer","veri","interest","ye","lui","rainer","paul","muni","excel","job","act","film","drag","wai","long","tell","end","thi","movi","act","short","wang","lung","muni","small","time","farmer","doe","want","like","hi","father","turn","exactli","like","fall","love","wife","thei","death","bed","film","doe","complet","go","gener","next","conjur","thi","film","ani","good","charact","actor","funni","moment","depress","stuff","last","farmer","dure","time","crisi"],"filtered2":["good","earth","great","ani","mean","wai","ordinari","mayb","differ","want","see","life","farmer","veri","interest","ye","lui","rainer","paul","muni","excel","job","act","drag","wai","long","tell","end","act","short","wang","lung","muni","small","time","farmer","doe","want","like","father","turn","exactli","like","fall","love","wife","death","bed","doe","complet","go","gener","next","conjur","ani","good","charact","actor","funni","moment","depress","stuff","last","farmer","dure","time","crisi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,8,10,15,18,21,24,27,33,37,39,41,51,54,60,62,75,88,90,96,99,103,144,163,170,188,204,209,225,239,245,263,272,289,297,342,361,363,462,522,580,764,840,1065,1075,1959,2951,3472,5271,5731],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,8,10,15,18,21,24,27,33,37,39,41,51,54,60,62,75,88,90,96,99,103,144,163,170,188,204,209,225,239,245,263,272,289,297,342,361,363,462,522,580,764,840,1065,1075,1959,2951,3472,5271,5731],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,2.430631986809635,2.324031090670098,1.3210361566119257,2.600540117735859,2.803707089537043,2.975308642954861,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,2.0226120445069267,1.9742250248702675,2.0317223413467334,2.0477128419653545,2.0390708128715254,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.2931108769894046,2.4000574358028657,2.4071371113909277,2.5378812223426954,2.624524614047584,2.6026896854443837,2.641219492619754,2.6593400337329487,2.7502029743242886,2.902686292364678,2.8028805344481915,2.8282659991423613,2.813490713560207,3.112795625839981,3.0399731661399314,3.0349689855553557,3.2639531875991072,3.604618302480356,3.5039747767006686,3.7465885637507435,4.049068857301474,4.1302590120314875,4.202455303235976,4.911775343041523,5.521540914662417,17.90348405187251,6.342521466732247,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.836996019284464E-5,7.784149322986323E-5,7.844663661403608E-5,7.799337111196017E-5,7.799464894553511E-5,7.78856280126182E-5,7.811727078311412E-5,7.785270189625679E-5,7.802774315079552E-5,8.656752165913635E-5,0.6029026690151601,7.772703047077142E-5,0.03378175459458045,8.03072551936498E-5,7.778370821055012E-5,7.756874760156622E-5,7.95036029799455E-5,7.81245897817326E-5,7.78822085462734E-5,7.794675904993737E-5,7.870093966043886E-5,7.8201991480973E-5,7.829103631201888E-5,7.837538612259185E-5,7.897687694597142E-5,7.856385011323642E-5,8.186652512261844E-5,7.775013800425407E-5,7.775221800252697E-5,7.794920280714636E-5,7.960599486470638E-5,7.812006312888118E-5,0.03960685025694025,7.833980333855132E-5,7.783476553295617E-5,7.819402428509647E-5,7.775677315281558E-5,7.78027216848186E-5,7.756835788990658E-5,7.758848270062157E-5,7.77631249456194E-5,7.858336113849246E-5,7.818404605733357E-5,7.787492819471508E-5,0.0515258061719911,7.790481701770178E-5,8.049320722697054E-5,7.930953115227396E-5,7.760776768017556E-5,7.777928559278948E-5,7.775230880619803E-5,0.21437351730142204,7.778044280027948E-5,7.758159461633969E-5,7.843316364506966E-5,7.780047697755089E-5,8.366586249577033E-5,7.

{"value":"To be honest, I didn't like \"Executive Decision\" - which was obvious the template - very much, but compared to this piece of crap, it looks like a masterpiece of art.<br /><br />Not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult for all other actors) should attend more acting classes, the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen an aircraft from afar. It is so ridiculous, that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The film is full of illogicalness (e.g.: use sleeping-gas, then don't use it, then use it anyway), which dropped my rating finally to the bottom.<br /><br />You can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk.","finished_norm":["to","be","honest","i","do","not","like","execut","decis","which","be","obviou","the","templat","veri","much","but","compar","to","thi","piec","of","crap","it","look","like","a","masterpiec","of","artbr","br","not","onli","that","the","peopl","move","in","the","film","the","term","actor","would","be","a","insult","for","all","other","actor","should","attend","much","act","class","the","gui","who","build","the","set","have","not","even","see","a","aircraft","from","afar","it","be","so","ridicul","that","on","a","onli","flight","attend","be","aboard","but","thi","be","onli","the","tip","of","the","iceberg","the","film","be","full","of","illogic","eg","us","sleepingga","then","do","not","us","it","then","us","it","anywai","which","drop","my","rate","final","to","the","bottombr","br","you","can","have","much","fun","in","rearrang","you","sock","drawer","or","in","drill","a","hole","in","your","knee","and","fill","it","with","milk"],"filtered":["honest","like","execut","decis","obviou","templat","veri","much","compar","thi","piec","crap","look","like","masterpiec","artbr","br","onli","peopl","move","film","term","actor","insult","actor","attend","much","act","class","gui","build","set","even","see","aircraft","afar","ridicul","onli","flight","attend","aboard","thi","onli","tip","iceberg","film","full","illogic","eg","us","sleepingga","us","us","anywai","drop","rate","final","bottombr","br","much","fun","rearrang","sock","drawer","drill","hole","knee","fill","milk"],"filtered2":["honest","like","execut","decis","obviou","templat","veri","compar","piec","crap","look","like","masterpiec","artbr","onli","peopl","move","term","actor","insult","actor","attend","act","class","gui","build","set","even","see","aircraft","afar","ridicul","onli","flight","attend","aboard","onli","tip","iceberg","full","illogic","eg","us","sleepingga","us","us","anywai","drop","rate","final","bottombr","fun","rearrang","sock","drawer","drill","hole","knee","fill","milk"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,11,15,16,21,23,41,55,56,109,156,202,218,259,274,275,313,336,383,386,477,482,553,628,662,709,810,858,904,1103,1174,1483,1876,2131,2240,3016,3049,4313,4742,5498,5782,6628,7234,8003,8510,8525],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,11,15,16,21,23,41,55,56,109,156,202,218,259,274,275,313,336,383,386,477,482,553,628,662,709,810,858,904,1103,1174,1483,1876,2131,2240,3016,3049,4313,4742,5498,5782,6628,7234,8003,8510,8525],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,2.9739294460164585,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,3.1375198335242067,1.9536997889255368,5.583182805210536,2.125691139326857,2.3451551414151686,2.597304642813496,2.5940874818617203,2.7464553122240485,2.748952192422636,2.7832848715031413,2.907069060519773,2.9233055795674137,3.0433232530252132,3.0433232530252132,3.351345009714117,3.3154667220492153,3.454678155189441,3.607563812710113,3.616452760127359,3.6497387377608255,3.8425769395797067,3.8767358583910254,3.9121030022283168,4.160564361526816,4.235066888824737,4.5432147918688095,9.780538275641119,5.2288713006995975,5.089758498236879,5.501738287366237,5.426230734858092,5.999576715605417,6.2980697041614135,6.543192162194399,6.342521466732247,6.543192162194399,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.559476735427276E-5,6.515244650319813E-5,6.565894464870082E-5,6.527956656703246E-5,6.528063609923408E-5,6.518938681553108E-5,6.538326918579884E-5,6.516182802977576E-5,6.530833557349041E-5,7.245603327721822E-5,0.5370039535163551,6.505664247273953E-5,6.627089244309456E-5,6.721626128589802E-5,6.510408109776627E-5,6.492416150737813E-5,6.654361350271729E-5,6.538939510458793E-5,6.51865247610039E-5,6.524055280006403E-5,6.58717934127582E-5,6.545417944851264E-5,6.552870896163453E-5,6.559930879589878E-5,0.18046492182190513,6.57570510174154E-5,0.16112465398912687,6.507598321604467E-5,6.507772415099569E-5,6.524259819711667E-5,6.662931434833885E-5,6.538560634751886E-5,7.018590948681723E-5,6.55695264094434E-5,6.514681549723153E-5,6.544751099597417E-5,6.508153676009627E-5,6.511999515996778E-5,6.492383532314139E-5,6.494067956133736E-5,6.508685313859417E-5,6.577338152414737E-5,6.543915933256763E-5,6.518043118936562E-5,6.59724417741724E-5,6.520544779503292E-5,6.73719010276398E-5,6.638117758524573E-5,6.495682087038185E-5,6.510037941688762E-5,6.507780015263794E-5,6.690933407913017E-5,6.5101347986425E-5,6.493491431295808E-5,6.564766792656457E-5,6.51181163654572E-5,7.002737748494737E-5,6.5064450576289E-5,6.495606968201303E-5,6.526621585013855E-5,6.5913601859059E-5,0.057578415034849735,6.49440526639045E-5,6.509526494387614E-5,6.49246205884222E-5,6.642684174014027E-5,6.54839157

The \"hero\" was throwing the expected \"fit\" at seeing something so tragic and people were trying to hold him back from running into the burning car.<br /><br />In the middle of his fit and his uncontrollable rage/emotional break down he says \"I am so sad\" - he said that right?

{"value":"It's interesting at first. A naive park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a pretty, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) he's only known for a short time. They seem to be happy, then she disappears without warning. He searches for her and, after a few dead ends, stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past, which may include criminal activity. And then, it seems the filmmakers didn't know what to do with the story. The beginning, while not as suspenseful as it sounds, is at least watchable. Then it ceases to be interesting or even make much sense. And the ending is so lame, so dull, and so devoid of any excitement or intelligence, you'll think the screenwriters didn't know what to do with it and got bored trying.

{"value":"It's frequently said that movies can never equal the original book. Well, in this case, not only the movie is not \"as good\" as the book, but is an insult to the book. I'd rather see Milan Kundera's novel turned on fire than into this \"something,\" which the director probably calls \"adaptation.\"<br /><br />All the beautiful philosophy that asks \"is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders, or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?\" is put aside, and instead, all the movie deals with is Daniel Day Lewis' (I cannot say Tomas) sexual adventures with his dumb wife, his mistress, and his other mistresses. François Truffaut already said it: bad directors make bad movies. Don't waste your time and money.

{"value":"I rented this movie because it falls under the genres of \"romance\" and \"western\" with some Grand Canyon scenery thrown in. But if you're expecting a typical wholesome romantic western, forget it. This movie is pure trash! The romance is between a YOUNG GIRL who has not even gone through puberty and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN! The child is also lusted after by other leering men. It's sickening.<br /><br />Peter Fonda is portrayed as being virtuous by trying to resist his attraction to Brooke Shields, and her character is mostly the one that pursues the relationship. He tries to shoo her off at first but eventually he gives in and they drive off as a happy, loving couple. It's revolting.<br /><br />I don't see how this movie could appeal to anyone except pedophiles.","finished_norm":["i","rent","thi","movi","becaus","it","fall","under","the","genr","of","romanc","and","western","with","some","grand","canyon","sceneri","throw","in","but","if","you","re","expect","a","typic","wholesom","romant","western","forget","it","thi","movi","be","pure","trash","the","romanc","be","between","a","young","girl","who","have","not","even","go","through","puberti","and","a","middleag","man","the","child","be","conjur","lust","after","by","other","leer","man","it","sickeningbr","br","peter","fonda","be","portrai","a","be","virtuou","by","try","to","resist","hi","attract","to","brook","shield","and","her","charact","be","mostli","the","on","that","pursu","the","relationship","he","try","to","shoo","her","off","at","but","eventu","he","give","in","and","thei","drive","off","a","a","happi","love","coupl","it","revoltingbr","br","i","do","not","see","how","thi","movi","can","appeal","to","anyon","except","pedophil"],"filtered":["rent","thi","movi","becaus","fall","genr","romanc","western","grand","canyon","sceneri","throw","re","expect","typic","wholesom","romant","western","forget","thi","movi","pure","trash","romanc","young","girl","even","go","puberti","middleag","man","child","conjur","lust","leer","man","sickeningbr","br","peter","fonda","portrai","virtuou","try","resist","hi","attract","brook","shield","charact","mostli","pursu","relationship","try","shoo","eventu","give","thei","drive","happi","love","coupl","revoltingbr","br","see","thi","movi","appeal","anyon","except","pedophil"],"filtered2":["rent","becaus","fall","genr","romanc","western","grand","canyon","sceneri","throw","re","expect","typic","wholesom","romant","western","forget","pure","trash","romanc","young","girl","even","go","puberti","middleag","man","child","conjur","lust","leer","man","sickeningbr","peter","fonda","portrai","virtuou","try","resist","attract","brook","shield","charact","mostli","pursu","relationship","try","shoo","eventu","give","drive","happi","love","coupl","revoltingbr","see","appeal","anyon","except","pedophil"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,10,22,30,36,39,45,54,68,84,130,135,158,170,180,233,253,310,373,461,467,469,510,577,605,613,648,661,671,689,716,725,760,770,864,892,1138,1744,2175,2359,2463,3093,3667,4119,4375,4477,5730,6027,6154],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,10,22,30,36,39,45,54,68,84,130,135,158,170,180,233,253,310,373,461,467,469,510,577,605,613,648,661,671,689,716,725,760,770,864,892,1138,1744,2175,2359,2463,3093,3667,4119,4375,4477,5730,6027,6154],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.2979240167361772,1.3364419891718522,2.9360366939211433,1.5538940054862738,3.632592212924433,1.8113893252729412,2.0064197866819473,2.2212694515902225,2.2642139034199635,2.366244071437088,2.3106972614914807,2.4071371113909277,2.7097314792693545,2.6102777977348763,2.7073305177318163,2.854312708080462,3.0316467233633775,3.358217889001879,3.342254038012865,3.328770687675578,3.374440724508766,3.604618302480356,3.5474598886404074,3.5364100524538222,3.6105180246075443,3.5727776966246974,3.6466665387238555,3.634471265630037,3.6746621462132825,3.6466665387238555,3.850067611308864,8.107333133100207,3.9782428047328615,7.965050933049725,4.224077767249142,4.869215728622727,5.0768550934009715,5.390512652256013,5.185068678041204,5.482320201509136,5.672363804397,6.101359409915359,6.101359409915359,6.2980697041614135,6.342521466732247,6.543192162194399,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.564448835989882E-5,6.520183222845943E-5,6.570871430088431E-5,6.532904864963542E-5,6.533011899254525E-5,6.523880054164597E-5,6.54328298752587E-5,6.52112208662588E-5,6.535783946307569E-5,7.251095514040223E-5,0.5510155335195361,6.510595557829456E-5,6.632112595331056E-5,6.726721138817536E-5,6.515343016192346E-5,6.49733741920141E-5,6.659405373621148E-5,6.54389604375103E-5,6.523593631767397E-5,6.529000531012935E-5,6.592172440486289E-5,0.0361539286210244,6.557837989482578E-5,6.56490332439495E-5,6.615285584710977E-5,6.58068950344836E-5,0.08529984018184907,6.512531098193385E-5,6.512705323651811E-5,6.529205225759832E-5,6.66798195432987E-5,6.543516880855344E-5,0.09967949726521869,6.561922828236711E-5,6.519619695417553E-5,6.549712038089458E-5,6.51308687355864E-5,6.516935628702583E-5,6.497304776052884E-5,6.498990476670154E-5,6.513618914391313E-5,6.582323791978248E-5,6.548876238690528E-5,6.522983812709241E-5,6.60224490579989E-5,6.525487369541237E-5,6.742296910524944E-5,6.643149469188862E-5,6.50060583109006E-5,6.514972567516099E-5,6.512712929576981E-5,6.69600515297801E-5,6.515069497887661E-5,6.498413514824887E-5,6.569742903096312E-5,6.516747606838408E-5,7.008045842067357E-5,6.511376960040701E-5,6.500530655312902E-5,6.5

{"value":"Saw this on TV. I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema to see this or spend the money on rental. The movie is totally predictable - from the corrupt owner and planner, to the snaking electric cables. The plot is really weak and unbelievable - the avalanche expert guy gets hit by a 20 foot wave of bone breaking avalanche (using actual footage) and all he has to do is get up and shake himself down. The avalanche thunders down at a million miles an hour and stops dead at the side of the road.<br /><br />Some of the actual avalanche material is impressive and shows its devastating power. But the contract between the real avalanche and the staged stuff makes this film look even flimsier.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour, don't bother with this one not even on

{"value":"They played this on the July 4th Twilight Zone marathon and this is, hands down, the worst Twilight Zone episode I've ever seen. It's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. Even though Twilight Zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable, this one was completely out of place. Compare this to legendary episodes like \"A Stop at Willoughby\" or \"Midnight Sun\", and you realize there is no comparison.<br /><br />Buster Keaton did what he could with such terrible material, and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode. Even though he seemed to be giving it some effort, he MUST have needed the money... there's no other

{"value":"It is such a strange movie, you can call it awful or if you sit with friends it can give you a killer laugh-athon. Strange comes to mind again and again. Shot amateurishly, acted even worse and the directions, maybe none. The special effects are funny but the music accompanying a flying demon baby will surely be the biggest hit. See it if you got time to kill. But don't, don't even try to take it seriously. Supposed to be a tribute to 'Porno holocaust ',. Since I haven't seen it, from the tribute I can assume it to be as bad. Should have given it 1/10, but it did give me a good laugh or two, so it gets a 3. Excessive gore, the only thing somebody worked on. Stay away if you are squeamish, more gore than laughs.

{"value":"What else can you say about this movie,except that it's plain awful.Tina Louise and Adam West are the reasons why to see this,but,that's it,but their talents are wasted in this junk.I think that they used a double in some of Adam's scenes,like when he's running because you can't see his face.If Adam was embarrassed in being in Zombie Nightmare,just think what he must've felt about appearing in this??? If it was before or after,I'm not sure,but,still,Zombie Nightmare is a classic(check out the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version first and last)compared to this.The gang is very annoying and over-acting by some of the actors.A rip-off of The Wild One starring Marlon Brando,of course.Tina looks stunning though.I hope her and Adam got a good paycheck!!

Along with that, the stories on this were no where near as strong as The Big Valley.<br /><br />This is a show that I would not want DVDs of, & frankly hope they are never released. Think since CBS was running out of lots, they re-used many familiar settings. This was one the last western series CBS produced as westerns were not real popular in the 1970's.","finished_norm":["thi","seri","be","cb","network","answer","to","the","success","of","the","big","vallei","it","be","a","minut","western","just","like","the","abc","program","be","while","it","be","a","answer","it","do","not","have","the","stuff","to","make","it","past","season","br","br","the","problem","realli","becom","realiti","get","lose","on","thi","show","for","exampl","in","on","episod","johnni","get","hi","ey","poke","out","by","a","stick","amazingli","by","the","end","of","the","show","johnni","have","heal","entir","along","with","that","the","stori","on","thi","be","no","where","near","a","strong","a","the","big","valleybr","br","thi","be","a","show","that","i","would","not","want","dvd","of","frankli","hope","thei","be","never","releas","think","sinc","cb","be","run","out","of","lot","thei","reus","mani","familiar","set","thi","be","on","the","last","western","seri","cb","produc","a","western","be","not","real","popular","in","the"],"filtered":["thi","seri","cb","network","answer","success","big","vallei","minut","western","like","abc","program","answer","stuff","make","past","season","br","br","problem","realli","becom","realiti","get","lose","thi","show","exampl","episod","johnni","get","hi","ey","poke","stick","amazingli","end","show","johnni","heal","entir","along","stori","thi","near","strong","big","valleybr","br","thi","show","want","dvd","frankli","hope","thei","never","releas","think","sinc","cb","run","lot","thei","reus","mani","familiar","set","thi","last","western","seri","cb","produc","western","real","popular"],"filtered2":["cb","network","answer","success","big","vallei","minut","western","like","abc","program","answer","stuff","make","past","season","problem","realli","becom","realiti","get","lose","show","exampl","johnni","get","ey","poke","stick","amazingli","end","show","johnni","heal","entir","along","stori","near","strong","big","valleybr","show","want","dvd","frankli","hope","never","releas","think","sinc","cb","run","lot","reus","mani","familiar","set","last","western","cb","produc","western","real","popular"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,12,13,17,24,28,37,42,50,59,72,80,82,109,115,137,144,162,167,181,198,221,247,261,281,307,324,327,361,416,440,532,555,631,656,770,800,817,951,1095,1332,1422,1672,1792,2235,3045,3800,3875,4152,5467,6115],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,12,13,17,24,28,37,42,50,59,72,80,82,109,115,137,144,162,167,181,198,221,247,261,281,307,324,327,361,416,440,532,555,631,656,770,800,817,951,1095,1332,1422,1672,1792,2235,3045,3800,3875,4152,5467,6115],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.5932680941439847,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,4.635688258055728,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,1.717994385570355,1.8693254449200722,1.9209463754160525,1.9951803900462557,4.040393168790646,2.125691139326857,2.201553588425805,2.2939035841256437,2.2931108769894046,2.3586007221245198,2.4609576687888097,2.4442286541160034,2.5439726117360975,2.6423424573643777,2.7303758068497004,2.7085302779237206,2.832333801361687,2.8767855639325206,2.8753661172782943,2.9674191958529437,3.0399731661399314,3.1401446412440817,3.212973749990824,3.4446025032006995,3.432149042129413,3.607563812710113,3.68099128126493,12.160999699650311,7.8242060044566335,4.197121957260614,4.004218291136122,4.1554492608600455,4.383707912841026,4.671389985292807,9.981825327200493,4.8184434032493035,5.039114765418124,5.463272006538442,5.770002273960917,5.907203395474402,6.032366538428407,19.313494939609715,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.17944887929259E-5,6.137779410862303E-5,6.185494793107448E-5,6.149754938296589E-5,6.149855695107402E-5,6.141259425821633E-5,6.159524391824102E-5,6.138663210992016E-5,6.152465163698484E-5,6.825824249283318E-5,0.6409074509295197,6.128754055143734E-5,0.04830745084482441,6.332204034356172E-5,6.133223078666197E-5,6.116273496313355E-5,6.268836287848505E-5,0.048282546998056126,6.140989801881283E-5,6.146079590577648E-5,6.205546515364642E-5,6.166204594546531E-5,6.173225753930295E-5,6.179876712296627E-5,6.227304091171028E-5,6.194737043894473E-5,6.455152020949122E-5,6.130576077530004E-5,6.130740084797137E-5,6.146272280132539E-5,6.276909858588842E-5,6.159744567486797E-5,6.611963990633661E-5,6.17707101998263E-5,6.13724893389115E-5,6.165576383437209E-5,6.131099257090662E-5,6.134722285657891E-5,6.116242767660788E-5,6.11782960321248E-5,6.131600094131111E-5,6.196275482638803E-5,6.164789603040549E-5,6.140415748249418E-5,6.215028238209766E-5,6.142772473367742E-5,6.346866298839636E-5,0.2577986575723556,6.119350218318049E-5,6.132874356524481E-5,6.130747244640551E-5,6.30328951784234E-5,6.132965602003102E-5,6.117286479742832E-5,6.184432453369422E-5,

{"value":"This film makes you really appreciate the invention of the fast forward button on your remote control. It's exquisite boredom in beautiful pictures. For once Hamilton goes relatively easy on soft focus shots. However, what I found hard to take about the film was that although Anja Schüte was about 19 when it was shot the girls are portrayed as much younger than they actually are. This whole Lolita thing especially as there is an older man involved leaves me rather uneasy. The heroine is actually shaved in the pubic area in order to make her look even younger than she is. Come on, sex is a nice past time- between consenting adults. Another thing I found odd was that neither Beart nor Schüte have a nude scene in the film, well, not a proper one at

{"value":"This a fascinatingly awful movie. It make so little sense that it starts to make a kind of weird internal logic of its own. Well, it would if it didn't keep darting off up side-alleys until eventually floundering under the weight of its own indecisiveness. The movie can't make up its mind whether it is a straight forward 'Man Turns Into Monster' flick (like all those 1950s 'THE INCREDIBLE insert verb ING MAN' movies), or a ghastly big business conspiracy theory movie, or a mystical afterlife contact story, or... or what? Take your pick. It's just a mess. Grotesquely over the top and firing off in all directions, leaving loose ends flapping all over the place. It was as if Tobe Hooper had been taking David Lynch pills.

{"value":"This is another of the many B minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it. All aspects of the film - script, acting, direction - are mediocre. The acting by the three leads is wooden. I guess John Dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing TV work. Lee J Cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction. Jane Wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers. The movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that I have ever seen, the one in which John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly strange. The DVD transfer is typical

{"value":"I think I found the most misogynistic film of all time: Darklight.<br /><br />The gist of the film- Lilith was Adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam's equal and refused to submit to him. See, I took those words straight from the script. Then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film, the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do! She ends the film under the control of The Faith- an all male group!<br /><br />Other than that the script was predictable and the FX were awful. Apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film, there was nothing original about

{"value":"I can't figure out how anyone can get a budget for a movie this bad. It's like the TV station are desperate for anything, anything at all. They're buried underneath a bunch of snow, the electricity constantly flashes on and off, yet magically there is a background light that stays constant. Where does all this (fake) light come from? That, and all that stupid bickering between the characters. They seem to be more interested in complaining to each other than trying to invent ways to survive. It tries to create that feel of emergency and people helping. But because it's such bad directing and acting, you will not your Florence Nightingale fix with this flick, sorry. I'm joining the negative feedback, and I concur that this is one of the worst movies

{"value":"Oh dear.

Such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: Oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand over there ... hmm this is a bit puzzling ...<br /><br />For many years fans of British cult TV shows campaigned to have this serial released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC always said no.

{"value":"This film is in no way entertainment but more of a look deep into the depths of the darkest side of human behaviour. Loosely linking a half a dozen stories of the worst kind of depravities, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. All the action is played out over a few very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in Vienna and the heat is maybe responsible for some of the anger and hate in the film. For me the treatment of the retarded girl by the security equipment salesman was about the worst episode, closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the 'slags' flat. You will be gripped and I hope horrified by this film.

{"value":"I'll say one thing about this film: there are no lulls. You can't get bored watching this. The problem is that it is TOO intense. There is too much action and it NEEDS lulls! That is the risk you take in modern action films. You want it interesting but not overdone. This is way overdone.<br /><br />Even though the acting is fine and features a couple of \"names\" in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider, it still has the feel of a \"B\" film. The best part of it is Scheider's dialog: the only \"A\" part of this \"B\" film.<br /><br />The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes. One in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines. That was memorable.

{"value":"This movie is really goofy! I saw it as an 11 year old, and even then I thought it was pretty ridiculous! I would only recommend this film to kids under the age of 12. I really didn't care for it, but I do think that it answers some very good questions that kids need to be aware of, such as: 1)Does money buy happiness? 2)Should I lie (to my parents) about things I think they wouldn't approve of? 3)Does money buy friendships? 4)Is money everything? 5)Shouldn't I tell my parents when someone is trying to hurt me? Granted, these are very unrealistic situations, but I do think that if parents discussed these issues with their children, maybe they should watch this video as well, in order to show/scare their kids that lies have the potential to get you hurt.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","realli","goofi","i","see","it","a","a","year","old","and","even","then","i","think","it","be","pretti","ridicul","i","would","onli","recommend","thi","film","to","kid","under","the","ag","of","i","realli","do","not","care","for","it","but","i","do","think","that","it","answer","some","veri","good","question","that","kid","ne","to","be","awar","of","such","a","doe","monei","bui","happi","should","i","lie","to","my","parent","about","thing","i","think","thei","would","not","approv","of","doe","monei","bui","friendship","be","monei","everyth","shouldnt","i","tell","my","parent","when","someon","be","try","to","hurt","me","grant","thi","be","veri","unrealist","situat","but","i","do","think","that","if","parent","discuss","thi","issu","with","their","child","mayb","thei","should","watch","thi","video","a","good","in","order","to","showscar","their","kid","that","lie","have","the","potenti","to","get","you","hurt"],"filtered":["thi","movi","realli","goofi","see","year","old","even","think","pretti","ridicul","onli","recommend","thi","film","kid","ag","realli","care","think","answer","veri","good","question","kid","ne","awar","doe","monei","bui","happi","lie","parent","thing","think","thei","approv","doe","monei","bui","friendship","monei","everyth","shouldnt","tell","parent","someon","try","hurt","grant","thi","veri","unrealist","situat","think","parent","discuss","thi","issu","child","mayb","thei","watch","thi","video","good","order","showscar","kid","lie","potenti","get","hurt"],"filtered2":["realli","goofi","see","year","old","even","think","pretti","ridicul","onli","recommend","kid","ag","realli","care","think","answer","veri","good","question","kid","ne","awar","doe","monei","bui","happi","lie","parent","thing","think","approv","doe","monei","bui","friendship","monei","everyth","shouldnt","tell","parent","someon","try","hurt","grant","veri","unrealist","situat","think","parent","discuss","issu","child","mayb","watch","video","good","order","showscar","kid","lie","potenti","get","hurt"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,7,11,12,13,15,18,29,36,57,67,78,90,110,114,126,139,163,180,193,205,240,274,298,347,378,439,442,473,547,605,650,670,800,806,863,1066,1264,1326,1625,1987,3182,4251],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,7,11,12,13,15,18,29,36,57,67,78,90,110,114,126,139,163,180,193,205,240,274,298,347,378,439,442,473,547,605,650,670,800,806,863,1066,1264,1326,1625,1987,3182,4251],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,4.266914441051552,2.2635883139467947,2.4001215597131385,2.430631986809635,1.3195384777338066,1.4680183469605717,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,2.0064197866819473,2.0477128419653545,2.1290479736304078,7.329922258790048,6.7173812069706855,2.2939035841256437,2.4000574358028657,2.7097314792693545,2.517840471459249,2.571852579609833,2.7666071276613566,2.748952192422636,2.7819920465008363,6.030397968308703,3.130944944345658,3.2872346624216657,3.257696649984802,3.335489637924323,3.432149042129413,3.5474598886404074,7.324245593921095,11.179360966025062,3.9121030022283168,3.880604335168946,7.889252387867754,4.3095999406873045,4.327618446189983,4.456830177669989,4.671389985292807,4.869215728622727,5.583416318380505,5.9370563586240825]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.724563443875285E-5,7.672474906717719E-5,7.73212108303556E-5,7.687444805044735E-5,7.68757075517277E-5,7.676825067527213E-5,7.699657020900772E-5,7.673579692970834E-5,7.690832697472214E-5,8.532559051830426E-5,0.821540328938653,7.661192843508934E-5,7.804185208769914E-5,7.91551362563368E-5,7.666779305409625E-5,7.645591635313274E-5,7.836301354805751E-5,7.700378420644182E-5,7.676488026591379E-5,7.682850470309093E-5,7.757186554691732E-5,7.708007547097416E-5,7.716784283044078E-5,7.725098252601374E-5,7.784384412944844E-5,7.74367427393707E-5,0.03302227410379724,7.66347044589611E-5,7.663675461677447E-5,7.683091340121401E-5,7.846393647924532E-5,7.699932249470263E-5,8.265224995293662E-5,7.721591022635269E-5,7.671811788841152E-5,7.707222257557053E-5,7.664124441711558E-5,7.668653375371049E-5,7.645553223242726E-5,7.64753683248256E-5,7.664750508464364E-5,7.745597385191363E-5,7.706238749932165E-5,7.675770436109419E-5,7.769039095444975E-5,7.67871643874685E-5,7.933842054988107E-5,7.817172594987208E-5,7.649437663460553E-5,7.666343388492019E-5,7.663684411774095E-5,7.879369299234522E-5,7.666457449066406E-5,7.64685790596644E-5,7.730793114981188E-5,7.668432124988124E-5,8.246555967934903E-5,7.662112340500493E-5,7.649349202102318E-5,7.685872599458409E-5,7.762109996133273E-5,7.685364135267987E-5,7.647934055398858E-5,7.665741098509865E-5,7.645645697562348E-5,7.822550091940413E-5,7.711509346223269E-5,7.6950827

{"value":"There is one good thing in this movie: Lola Glaudini's ass! Sorry to be so blunt but it's the truth. Too bad she didn't do a nude. It would at least have made this mess tolerable. We see another chick's boobs but she's nowhere near Lola. And man, is Armand Assante old or what? The man looks like crap! \"Consequence\" is the usual B-Movie you would expect. The story had potential. It's like they had good ideas but didn't know how to execute them. The cinematography is just plain awful. Ugly! The directing is uninspired and the end result is a bland thriller with lame twists and washed up actors. Lola Gaudini is great as the vixen in a cheap, slutty way but not even she saves \"Consequence\" from being trash and not funny trash, just plain old stinking trash.","finished_norm":["there","be","on","good","thing","in","thi","movi","lola","glaudini","ass","sorri","to","be","so","blunt","but","it","the","truth","too","bad","she","do","not","do","a","nude","it","would","at","littl","have","make","thi","mess","toler","we","see","anoth","chick","boob","but","she","nowher","near","lola","and","man","be","armand","assant","old","or","what","the","man","look","like","crap","consequ","be","the","usual","bmovi","you","would","expect","the","stori","have","potenti","it","like","thei","have","good","idea","but","do","not","know","how","to","execut","them","the","cinematographi","be","just","plain","aw","ugli","the","direct","be","uninspir","and","the","end","result","be","a","bland","thriller","with","lame","twist","and","wash","up","actor","lola","gaudini","be","great","a","the","vixen","in","a","cheap","slutti","wai","but","not","even","she","save","consequ","from","be","trash","and","not","funni","trash","just","plain","old","stink","trash"],"filtered":["good","thing","thi","movi","lola","glaudini","ass","sorri","blunt","truth","bad","nude","littl","make","thi","mess","toler","see","anoth","chick","boob","nowher","near","lola","man","armand","assant","old","man","look","like","crap","consequ","usual","bmovi","expect","stori","potenti","like","thei","good","idea","know","execut","cinematographi","plain","aw","ugli","direct","uninspir","end","result","bland","thriller","lame","twist","wash","actor","lola","gaudini","great","vixen","cheap","slutti","wai","even","save","consequ","trash","funni","trash","plain","old","stink","trash"],"filtered2":["good","thing","lola","glaudini","ass","sorri","blunt","truth","bad","nude","littl","make","mess","toler","see","anoth","chick","boob","nowher","near","lola","man","armand","assant","old","man","look","like","crap","consequ","usual","bmovi","expect","stori","potenti","like","good","idea","know","execut","cinematographi","plain","aw","ugli","direct","uninspir","end","result","bland","thriller","lame","twist","wash","actor","lola","gaudini","great","vixen","cheap","slutti","wai","even","save","consequ","trash","funni","trash","plain","old","stink","trash"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,9,14,16,17,24,26,29,33,41,45,51,62,67,73,102,123,130,138,189,265,313,351,372,407,435,437,447,547,555,586,629,662,671,714,758,799,895,1028,1042,1287,1408,1549,1661,1673,1867,2307,2672,3543,5158,7127,7140,7565],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,9,14,16,17,24,26,29,33,41,45,51,62,67,73,102,123,130,138,189,265,313,351,372,407,435,437,447,547,555,586,629,662,671,714,758,799,895,1028,1042,1287,1408,1549,1661,1673,1867,2307,2672,3543,5158,7127,7140,7565],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.5687599167621034,3.632592212924433,1.7139899308309823,2.0226120445069267,3.9141830778533158,1.8950689206770979,2.087553710177271,2.2619070973220485,2.2642139034199635,2.2907365189289424,2.498193474075453,2.73529586597515,2.907069060519773,3.0135689919434205,3.070535816550098,3.120015873813468,3.2829611516442836,3.1952392950510555,3.2070272508030975,3.432149042129413,3.432149042129413,6.914426021585259,3.488143311483988,3.616452760127359,10.939999616171566,3.7297814454343623,3.8240921249056035,3.7636829971100436,3.9954846111673676,4.086456389373095,4.176068548062782,4.499089986959872,4.477736862489302,4.528289141652134,4.688631791727313,4.654440426979034,4.8184434032493035,10.153710186801943,5.259176650194926,5.770002273960917,6.1754673820690815,6.948657270302562,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.256718902443053E-5,6.214528384182405E-5,6.262840416511195E-5,6.226653657864319E-5,6.226755674574074E-5,6.218051914484562E-5,6.236545272107939E-5,6.215423235662784E-5,6.229397772887058E-5,6.911176779592377E-5,0.8554239974386507,6.205390172210966E-5,6.321210702540455E-5,6.41138416220993E-5,6.209915077990534E-5,6.192753552041041E-5,6.34722404289762E-5,6.237129589324517E-5,6.217778919070717E-5,6.22293235229236E-5,6.283142872623996E-5,6.243309006457394E-5,6.250417960911353E-5,6.257152085222899E-5,6.305172512884525E-5,6.272198235684047E-5,6.535869534086894E-5,6.207234977812167E-5,6.207401035884407E-5,6.22312745130587E-5,6.355398568433472E-5,6.236768200925306E-5,6.694642336325353E-5,6.254311309535887E-5,6.213991273938828E-5,6.242672939973278E-5,6.207764699395835E-5,6.21143303159883E-5,6.192722439146491E-5,6.194329117053418E-5,6.208271799080489E-5,6.273755911612747E-5,6.241876321395148E-5,6.217197687268388E-5,6.292743158298597E-5,6.21958388171448

{"value":"Yes, it can be done. John De Bello and Costa Dillon cleaned out the garbage of their minds and come up with the worst comedic, horror , Sc-Fi musical. If there is any acting, it is terrible or way over the top. Special effects; take your pick...very low budget or kindergarten. Every cheap cliché thought of is used. No doubt a fun movie to watch. Worth a cold six-pack or two. Point the finger at radiation if you need an excuse. Mutant tomatoes grow to almost the size of a tow truck and begin attacking mankind. San Diego is a good place as any to start. Scientists and an absent minded military must find the way to stop this red rolling menace.

{"value":"Well, basically, the movie blows! It's Blair Witch meets Sean Penn's ill conceived fantasy about going to Iraq to show the world what the \"War on Terror\" is really about. The script sounds like it was written by 8th grader (no offense to 8th graders); the two main actors over-act the entire film; they used the wrong kind of camera and the wrong type of film(not that i know anything about those things--but it just didn't look like real documentaries I've watched), and worst of all Christian Johnson took a great idea and made it suck. It reminded me of the time I tried to draw a picture of my dog and ended up with a really bad stick figure looking thing that looked more like a giant turd.

{"value":"I don't think I've ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap. NOTHING in it makes any sense. none of it is clever or well thought out. out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total cop-out trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothing's there. thats OK to do once, maybe, but i counted three times. there are things thrown in for no apparent reason, characters, half-formed story lines.... the characters weren't well developed at ALL. the ending was.. bad. bad, bad, bad, everything, every component, of this film is terrible. and I'm just here to

{"value":"This movie was bizarre, completely inexplicable, and hysterical to watch with friends while drinking in a big empty house. I really love the opening stuff with Lisa wandering about lost in a gorgeous city. I want to be a beautiful stranger lost in some exotic European locale, though maybe not in a low budget horror flick. Definitely get the ending where there are the strangely non-sexual sex scenes that were cut out (in my DVD copy anyway). Don't attempt to understand it, just go along and watch out for the weird bits...which is everything. Don't watch this if you actually want plot or characterization or anything at all to make sense.

{"value":"Cheap and manipulative. This film has no heart.<br /><br />It's also got dire dialogue, unconvincing characters and a preposterous, or rather non-existent, story. It just lurches from bad to worse in a cynical effort to wrench some kind of emotion from an insincere and unengaging hysterion-afest!<br /><br />And the HEDGEHOG!!!!How many cheap shots can a film take? The hedgehog, by the way, gave the most convincing and watchable performance in this ninety-minute cringe-athon.<br /><br />If you have considered watching this film, don't. I'm sorry but I cannot find a single redeeming feature to this movie. It scores a big, fat ZERO with me. Strictly for sub-Dogma knicker-wetters.

{"value":"Yes, MTV there really is a way to market Daria. What started as a clever teenage angst-\"comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life\" sitcom now mutated into a \"how you should deal with your problems\"-charade. I used to watch Daria all the time and loved it. Now, sitting here after watching the so called \"movie\" I can only wonder what the point of this all was. Daria tells us how to lead out life in college? Excuse me? didn't the point Daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok, as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it? This entire thing reminded me of the scene in \"Reality Bites\" the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time.","finished_norm":["ye","mtv","there","realli","be","a","wai","to","market","daria","what","start","a","a","clever","teenag","angstcom","on","everyth","that","suck","and","make","the","viewer","feel","well","about","their","sucki","teenag","life","sitcom","now","mutat","into","a","how","you","should","deal","with","your","problemscharad","i","us","to","watch","daria","all","the","time","and","love","it","now","sit","here","after","watch","the","so","call","movi","i","can","onli","wonder","what","the","point","of","thi","all","be","daria","tell","u","how","to","lead","out","life","in","colleg","excus","me","do","not","the","point","daria","make","everi","episod","that","what","you","like","to","do","be","okai","a","long","a","it","be","okai","with","yourself","no","matt","what","the","rest","of","the","sick","sad","world","think","of","it","thi","entir","thing","remind","me","of","the","scene","in","realiti","bite","the","movi","channel","show","the","documentri","for","the","time"],"filtered":["ye","mtv","realli","wai","market","daria","start","clever","teenag","angstcom","everyth","suck","make","viewer","feel","well","sucki","teenag","life","sitcom","mutat","deal","problemscharad","us","watch","daria","time","love","sit","watch","call","movi","onli","wonder","point","thi","daria","tell","u","lead","life","colleg","excus","point","daria","make","everi","episod","like","okai","long","okai","matt","rest","sick","sad","world","think","thi","entir","thing","remind","scene","realiti","bite","movi","channel","show","documentri","time"],"filtered2":["ye","mtv","realli","wai","market","daria","start","clever","teenag","angstcom","everyth","suck","make","viewer","feel","well","sucki","teenag","life","sitcom","mutat","deal","problemscharad","us","watch","daria","time","love","sit","watch","call","onli","wonder","point","daria","tell","u","lead","life","colleg","excus","point","daria","make","everi","like","okai","long","okai","matt","rest","sick","sad","world","think","entir","thing","remind","scene","realiti","bite","channel","show","documentri","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,8,11,12,13,19,20,28,29,33,43,54,56,66,71,75,85,90,99,112,142,154,157,165,175,191,193,198,209,226,244,279,408,421,455,468,617,644,656,692,728,778,814,955,1241,1869,3188,3626],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,8,11,12,13,19,20,28,29,33,43,54,56,66,71,75,85,90,99,112,142,154,157,165,175,191,193,198,209,226,244,279,408,421,455,468,617,644,656,692,728,778,814,955,1241,1869,3188,3626],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.9218995441445863,1.8837873718108231,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.6608112036218214,1.8113893252729412,1.8610609350701788,3.859446346783224,1.9214926742550966,3.948450049740535,2.011190219103739,2.0477128419653545,2.056430207256609,2.2466628996789315,2.2844323215331563,2.348499626138016,2.3360150694757706,2.448847599972298,2.3791142619576227,5.092022696851891,2.517840471459249,2.5439726117360975,2.6026896854443837,2.5940874818617203,2.634508058031767,2.7910771187233068,3.130944944345658,3.2597778161886266,3.2787058260741455,3.304513710030018,3.5119855004467477,3.5670958631572662,3.68099128126493,7.506782622146992,3.7740817043309423,3.8059428063999263,3.9363956947973615,4.017463517886143,4.3215761317340196,5.00274712124725,5.5623629091826725,5.822646007446338]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.821965841273577E-5,8.762477263198617E-5,8.83059716846728E-5,8.779573883952375E-5,8.779717727385766E-5,8.767445436525723E-5,8.793521047686738E-5,8.763739002668776E-5,8.78344308270856E-5,9.744750630999282E-5,0.9930182311158384,8.749592395727445E-5,8.91289919889643E-5,9.04004441030214E-5,8.755972507227538E-5,8.731774777063979E-5,8.949577976323801E-5,8.794344934232627E-5,8.767060513333021E-5,8.774326847741757E-5,8.859223606239823E-5,8.803057904675318E-5,8.813081521580262E-5,8.822576628452354E-5,8.890285371504371E-5,8.843791681818277E-5,9.215567883387106E-5,8.752193569321999E-5,8.752427710996544E-5,8.774601937107237E-5,8.961104047123905E-5,8.793835377040912E-5,9.439437336324179E-5,8.818571138280219E-5,8.761719938425726E-5,8.802161051726809E-5,8.752940476093642E-5,8.758112819920154E-5,8.731730907921505E-5,8.733996321764422E-5,8.753655486015917E-5,8.84598800293307E-5,8.80103782052618E-5,8.766240977217373E-5,8.872759997055583E-5,8.769605508407331E-5,9.060975951289614E-5,8.927731658802917E-5,8.73616719732001E-5,8.755474661079377E-5,8.752437932602914E-5,8.998764436809894E-5,8.755604925850766E-5,8.733220942472447E-5,8.829080540518129E-5,8.757860137249513E-5,9.418116063886529E-5,8.750642522522264E-5,8.736066168558153E-5,8.777778320477647E-5,8.864846504224206E-

{"value":"this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic American) to write a story of a moon trip. Absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities Maybe it held some fascination in the 3D dept. but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while. Save your time and money and watch BOLT instead<br /><br />Damn. Not enough lines, yet I feel that sums it up... well, I agree with an above review - this is like a cold-war propaganda story. Maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies had died in the first minute.

{"value":"I tried twice to get through this film, succeeding the first time - and it was like pulling teeth - and failing the second time despite a great DVD transfer. The problem? It's simply too boring.<br /><br />If you can get to the dramatic courtroom scene, which takes up most of the second half of the film, you have it made, but it's tough getting to that point. There are some interesting talks by \"Abraham Lincoln\" (Henry Fonda) during the trial. The ending is touching as Lincoln walks off and they superimpose his Memoral statue over the screen.<br /><br />It's a nice story, well-acted and such....but it lacks spark in the first half and discourages the viewer from hanging in there. I suspect the real Abe Lincoln was a lot more interesting than this film.","finished_norm":["i","try","twice","to","get","through","thi","film","succ","the","time","and","it","be","like","pull","tooth","and","fail","the","time","despit","a","great","dvd","transfer","the","problem","it","simpli","too","boringbr","br","if","you","can","get","to","the","dramat","courtroom","scene","which","take","up","much","of","the","half","of","the","film","you","have","it","make","but","it","tough","get","to","that","point","there","be","some","interest","talk","by","abraham","lincoln","henri","fonda","dure","the","trial","the","end","be","touch","a","lincoln","walk","off","and","thei","superimpos","hi","memor","statu","over","the","screenbr","br","it","a","nice","stori","wellact","and","suchbut","it","lack","spark","in","the","half","and","discourag","the","viewer","from","hang","in","there","i","suspect","the","real","ab","lincoln","be","a","lot","much","interest","than","thi","film"],"filtered":["try","twice","get","thi","film","succ","time","like","pull","tooth","fail","time","despit","great","dvd","transfer","problem","simpli","boringbr","br","get","dramat","courtroom","scene","take","much","half","film","make","tough","get","point","interest","talk","abraham","lincoln","henri","fonda","dure","trial","end","touch","lincoln","walk","thei","superimpos","hi","memor","statu","screenbr","br","nice","stori","wellact","suchbut","lack","spark","half","discourag","viewer","hang","suspect","real","ab","lincoln","lot","much","interest","thi","film"],"filtered2":["try","twice","get","succ","time","like","pull","tooth","fail","time","despit","great","dvd","transfer","problem","simpli","boringbr","get","dramat","courtroom","scene","take","half","make","tough","get","point","interest","talk","abraham","lincoln","henri","fonda","dure","trial","end","touch","lincoln","walk","superimpos","memor","statu","screenbr","nice","stori","wellact","suchbut","lack","spark","half","discourag","viewer","hang","suspect","real","ab","lincoln","lot","interest"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,8,17,19,24,31,36,51,60,66,72,80,167,183,186,201,206,215,239,247,262,279,294,391,544,745,756,848,977,1074,1108,1139,1212,1256,1612,1681,2190,2470,2573,3047,3996,4477,4559,5602,6558,6706,6856,7078,7230],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,8,17,19,24,31,36,51,60,66,72,80,167,183,186,201,206,215,239,247,262,279,294,391,544,745,756,848,977,1074,1108,1139,1212,1256,1612,1681,2190,2470,2573,3047,3996,4477,4559,5602,6558,6706,6856,7078,7230],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,2.389902141215977,1.8837873718108231,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.4680183469605717,1.7139899308309823,3.676353282473182,1.929723173391612,1.9209463754160525,1.9951803900462557,2.4609576687888097,2.4885128563647294,2.571852579609833,2.561435818751577,5.194609285626992,2.605934685587711,2.6593400337329487,2.7303758068497004,2.726701583487816,2.7910771187233068,2.886778509330039,3.109204957709252,3.4222967456864013,3.6969916226113715,3.7636829971100436,3.827761853794566,4.035401218572811,4.110553940952155,4.263079925052412,4.186539847930077,4.550761997504193,4.291900363587903,5.02684467282631,4.74221603786142,5.064116067623542,5.156897801074508,5.243909178064138,5.408212229355414,5.7959777603641776,6.2980697041614135,6.101359409915359,20.383519771425913,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.11755635029019E-5,6.076304237652259E-5,6.123541709045292E-5,6.088159819814154E-5,6.088259567458299E-5,6.0797493972497246E-5,6.0978314238088687E-5,6.0771791857587196E-5,6.090842899962877E-5,6.757457711495497E-5,0.4660176981095162,6.067369278682894E-5,6.180613717478838E-5,0.1746366798797131,6.0717935410667213E-5,6.055013723451454E-5,6.206048466582253E-5,6.098402744584917E-5,6.079482473826504E-5,6.0845212838837284E-5,6.143392595948787E-5,0.030177018990619385,6.111395554914678E-5,6.11797989817639E-5,6.164932250801714E-5,6.132691390691274E-5,6.390498086354677E-5,6.069173051937957E-5,6.069335416530357E-5,6.084712043485949E-5,6.214041173523736E-5,6.098049394221734E-5,6.545739448437922E-5,6.115202307299318E-5,6.075779073867112E-5,6.103822799487811E-5,6.069690991402488E-5,6.07327773220279E-5,6.054983302572939E-5,6.0565542445931327E-5,6.07018681212649E-5,0.046081241969091885,6.103043899377803E-5,6.07891416983862E-5,6.152779351132934E-5,6.081247290315076E-5,0.04151265780852154,6.190899226505278E-5,6.058059629422288E-5,6.071448311679084E-5,6.069342504661742E-5,6.240156617657519E-5,6.07153864325526E-5,6.056016560975121E-5,6.122490009559227E-5,6.073102510432019E-5,6.530954298739544E-5,6.068097484839871E-5,6.057989571438072E-5,6.0869146936217835E-5,6.147291771698306E-5,6.086512009591856E-5,6.0568
