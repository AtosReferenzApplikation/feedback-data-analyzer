{"value":"'Metamoprhis' is the story of a dashing young scientist, revered at the local college, is brought under investigation by financial providers for the college. This forces him to take shortcuts in typical bad-Hollywood melodramatic fashion.<br /><br />My first thought after this movies conclusion was this. \"Not good, but not bad, for early-to-mid eighties.\" Of course, I then realized that it was made in 1990, which almost propelled it down to a '4', but decided to keep it at the mediocre '5' that it is.<br /><br />'Metamorphis' does on a few occasions, seem like a good movie desperately trying to get out. The acting, while not stellar, is mostly competent. You can even see the occasional glisten of a modest quality. Pacing is a large problem with the movie. After thinking I had been watching for ninety minutes, I realized I'd only been watching an hour. Special effects aren't stellar, but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness.<br /><br />The lead, a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me mostly of Matt Dillon's character in 'Wild Things'. The female heroine does an OK job, but does not distinguish herself in anyway. There's a 'naughty girl' role in here, and the actress does what she can with it, but it doesn't seem like much. There is a child actor that the director can't decide if he's morose, cheerful or just weird. <br /><br />Pacing, as I said, is the worst problem with this movie, until a final battle with the bad guy that would make a Power Ranger blush. It is bizarre and inexplicable, until the final scene which is supposed to be dramatic but simply hilarious, saturated with every bad camera trick and overacting that can be compressed in about thirty seconds.<br /><br />A decent one-time watch on the 'Mill Creek 50 Chilling Movie Pack'. Nothing that is going to bring you back, and nothing to buy on its own.","finished_norm":["metamoprhi","be","the","stori","of","a","dash","young","scientist","rever","at","the","local","colleg","be","bring","under","investig","by","financi","provid","for","the","colleg","thi","forc","him","to","take","shortcut","in","typic","badhollywood","melodramat","fashionbr","br","my","think","after","thi","movi","conclus","be","thi","not","good","but","not","bad","for","earlytomid","eighti","of","cours","i","then","realiz","that","it","be","make","in","which","almost","propel","it","down","to","a","but","decid","to","keep","it","at","the","mediocr","that","it","isbr","br","metamorphi","doe","on","a","few","occas","seem","like","a","good","movi","desper","try","to","get","out","the","act","while","not","stellar","be","mostli","compet","you","can","even","see","the","occasion","glisten","of","a","modest","qualiti","pace","be","a","larg","problem","with","the","movi","after","think","i","have","be","watch","for","nineti","minut","i","realiz","i","have","onli","be","watch","a","hour","special","effect","be","not","stellar","but","the","director","seem","to","be","mostli","compet","enough","to","work","around","that","weaknessbr","br","the","lead","a","mildli","charismat","male","that","seem","to","be","attempt","a","blend","channel","of","tom","cruis","and","christoph","reev","remind","me","mostli","of","matt","dillon","charact","in","wild","thing","the","femal","heroin","doe","a","okai","job","but","doe","not","distinguish","herself","in","anywai","there","a","naughti","girl","role","in","here","and","the","actress","doe","what","she","can","with","it","but","it","doe","not","seem","like","much","there","be","a","child","actor","that","the","director","ca","not","decid","if","he","moros","cheer","or","just","weird","br","br","pace","a","i","sai","be","the","wrong","problem","with","thi","movi","until","a","final","battl","with","the","bad","gui","that","would","make","a","power","ranger","blush","it","be","bizarr","and","inexplic","until","the","final","scene","which","be","suppos","to","be","dramat","but","simpli","hilari","satur","with","everi","bad","camera","trick","and","overact","that","can","be","compress","in","about","thirti","secondsbr","br","a","decent","onetim","watch","on","the","mill","creek","chill","movi","pack","noth","that","be","go","to","bring","you","back","and","noth","to","bui","on","it","own"],"filtered":["metamoprhi","stori","dash","young","scientist","rever","local","colleg","bring","investig","financi","provid","colleg","thi","forc","take","shortcut","typic","badhollywood","melodramat","fashionbr","br","think","thi","movi","conclus","thi","good","bad","earlytomid","eighti","cours","realiz","make","almost","propel","decid","keep","mediocr","isbr","br","metamorphi","doe","occas","seem","like","good","movi","desper","try","get","act","stellar","mostli","compet","even","see","occasion","glisten","modest","qualiti","pace","larg","problem","movi","think","watch","nineti","minut","realiz","onli","watch","hour","special","effect","stellar","director","seem","mostli","compet","enough","work","around","weaknessbr","br","lead","mildli","charismat","male","seem","attempt","blend","channel","tom","cruis","christoph","reev","remind","mostli","matt","dillon","charact","wild","thing","femal","heroin","doe","okai","job","doe","distinguish","anywai","naughti","girl","role","actress","doe","doe","seem","like","much","child","actor","director","ca","decid","moros","cheer","weird","br","br","pace","sai","wrong","problem","thi","movi","final","battl","bad","gui","make","power","ranger","blush","bizarr","inexplic","final","scene","suppos","dramat","simpli","hilari","satur","everi","bad","camera","trick","overact","compress","thirti","secondsbr","br","decent","onetim","watch","mill","creek","chill","movi","pack","noth","go","bring","back","noth","bui"],"filtered2":["metamoprhi","stori","dash","young","scientist","rever","local","colleg","bring","investig","financi","provid","colleg","forc","take","shortcut","typic","badhollywood","melodramat","fashionbr","think","conclus","good","bad","earlytomid","eighti","cours","realiz","make","almost","propel","decid","keep","mediocr","isbr","metamorphi","doe","occas","seem","like","good","desper","try","get","act","stellar","mostli","compet","even","see","occasion","glisten","modest","qualiti","pace","larg","problem","think","watch","nineti","minut","realiz","onli","watch","hour","special","effect","stellar","director","seem","mostli","compet","enough","work","around","weaknessbr","lead","mildli","charismat","male","seem","attempt","blend","channel","tom","cruis","christoph","reev","remind","mostli","matt","dillon","charact","wild","thing","femal","heroin","doe","okai","job","doe","distinguish","anywai","naughti","girl","role","actress","doe","doe","seem","like","child","actor","director","ca","decid","moros","cheer","weird","pace","wrong","problem","final","battl","bad","gui","make","power","ranger","blush","bizarr","inexplic","final","scene","

{"value":"I had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school. As figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new. Though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through. It had an interesting side to it but it just doesn't live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original. We have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him, we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust, then we have the father who is always gone. Then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does. On to the story like I said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling. Everything about this fell into cliché the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl, they get together, have sex and then boom we have a little kid. Perhaps it could've been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved I've seriously gotten more emotion out of Leatherface and his chainsaw than I did out of any actor in this film and that's pretty bad seeing as the Leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted. So far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie I've seen was Juno. So far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message. Like I said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity. I really hope someone decides to either re-make this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted

{"value":"I've seen plenty of Sci-Fi Channel Original movies ever since I started watching them back in 2002 (My first one was Sabretooth - which actually is one of the more entertaining Sci-Fi Channel features in my opinion). Their quality varies. Some of them are average but decent (Sabretooth, Dragon Fighter, Never Cry Werewolf, Swamp Devil), some are laughably bad, and then there are some that are truly terrible. Raptor Planet lies in the latter. <br /><br />Raptor Planet, a loose sequel to the 2004 Sci-Fi Channel Original Raptor Island, is a barely watchable mess of a film with truly horrid acting and lazy scriptwriting. The effects that bring the dinosaurs to life (a combination of puppetry and animatronics as well as CGI and stock footage from Raptor Planet) are some of the worst looking effects I've seen in a low budget film. The gore effects are even unconvincing. <br /><br />The plot involves a bunch of commandos who for some reason (I forget why) travel to a planet of alien dinosaurs. That's right folks, the dinosaurs are aliens. Dinosaurs in outer space. What's next, sharks in space?!? The rest of the plot is simple. The human cast are picked off and eaten. By now, we've come to expect this in the numerous dinosaurs movies and novels that are released, but this is the first killer dinosaur movie I've seen where I actually became bored with all the dinosaur attacks.<br /><br />There are a few chuckles in it though. There's one scene that stands out in which a man is being munched by a Carnotaur (brought to life by stock footage from the original film) that seconds later becomes a giant raptor. Also, a bit of trivia, this is the scene where Steven Baur is shooting at his own death scene from the first movie. <br /><br />While Raptor Island wasn't a good film to begin with, its a masterpiece compared to its sequel.<br /><br />Believe me when I say, this is quite possibly the worst movie Syfy has ever aired. It's darn near unwatchable.","finished_norm":["i","have","see","plenti","of","scifi","channel","origin","movi","ever","sinc","i","start","watch","them","back","in","my","on","be","sabretooth","which","actual","be","on","of","the","much","entertain","scifi","channel","featur","in","my","opinion","their","qualiti","vari","some","of","them","be","averag","but","decent","sabretooth","dragon","fighter","never","cry","werewolf","swamp","devil","some","be","laughabl","bad","and","then","there","be","some","that","be","truli","terribl","raptor","planet","lie","in","the","latter","br","br","raptor","planet","a","loos","sequel","to","the","scifi","channel","origin","raptor","island","be","a","bare","watchabl","mess","of","a","film","with","truli","horrid","act","and","lazi","scriptwrit","the","effect","that","bring","the","dinosaur","to","life","a","combin","of","puppetri","and","animatron","a","good","a","cgi","and","stock","footag","from","raptor","planet","be","some","of","the","wrong","look","effect","i","have","see","in","a","low","budget","film","the","gore","effect","be","even","unconvinc","br","br","the","plot","involv","a","bunch","of","commando","who","for","some","reason","i","forget","why","travel","to","a","planet","of","alien","dinosaur","that","right","folk","the","dinosaur","be","alien","dinosaur","in","outer","space","what","next","shark","in","space","the","rest","of","the","plot","be","simpl","the","human","cast","be","pick","off","and","eat","by","now","we","have","come","to","expect","thi","in","the","numer","dinosaur","movi","and","novel","that","be","releas","but","thi","be","the","killer","dinosaur","movi","i","have","see","where","i","actual","becom","bore","with","all","the","dinosaur","attacksbr","br","there","be","a","few","chuckl","in","it","though","there","on","scene","that","stand","out","in","which","a","man","be","be","munch","by","a","carnotaur","bring","to","life","by","stock","footag","from","the","origin","film","that","second","late","becom","a","giant","raptor","conjur","a","bite","of","trivium","thi","be","the","scene","where","steven","baur","be","shoot","at","hi","own","death","scene","from","the","movi","br","br","while","raptor","island","be","not","a","good","film","to","begin","with","it","a","masterpiec","compar","to","it","sequelbr","br","believ","me","when","i","sai","thi","be","quit","possibli","the","wrong","movi","syfi","have","ever","air","it","darn","near","unwatch"],"filtered":["see","plenti","scifi","channel","origin","movi","ever","sinc","start","watch","back","sabretooth","actual","much","entertain","scifi","channel","featur","opinion","qualiti","vari","averag","decent","sabretooth","dragon","fighter","never","cry","werewolf","swamp","devil","laughabl","bad","truli","terribl","raptor","planet","lie","latter","br","br","raptor","planet","loos","sequel","scifi","channel","origin","raptor","island","bare","watchabl","mess","film","truli","horrid","act","lazi","scriptwrit","effect","bring","dinosaur","life","combin","puppetri","animatron","good","cgi","stock","footag","raptor","planet","wrong","look","effect","see","low","budget","film","gore","effect","even","unconvinc","br","br","plot","involv","bunch","commando","reason","forget","travel","planet","alien","dinosaur","right","folk","dinosaur","alien","dinosaur","outer","space","next","shark","space","rest","plot","simpl","human","cast","pick","eat","come","expect","thi","numer","dinosaur","movi","novel","releas","thi","killer","dinosaur","movi","see","actual","becom","bore","dinosaur","attacksbr","br","chuckl","though","scene","stand","man","munch","carnotaur","bring","life","stock","footag","origin","film","second","late","becom","giant","raptor","conjur","bite","trivium","thi","scene","steven","baur","shoot","hi","death","scene","movi","br","br","raptor","island","good","film","begin","masterpiec","compar","sequelbr","br","believ","sai","thi","quit","possibli","wrong","movi","syfi","ever","air","darn","near","unwatch"],"filtered2":["see","plenti","scifi","channel","origin","ever","sinc","start","watch","back","sabretooth","actual","entertain","scifi","channel","featur","opinion","qualiti","vari","averag","decent","sabretooth","dragon","fighter","never","cry","werewolf","swamp","devil","laughabl","bad","truli","terribl","raptor","planet","lie","latter","raptor","planet","loos","sequel","scifi","channel","origin","raptor","island","bare","watchabl","mess","truli","horrid","act","lazi","scriptwrit","effect","bring","dinosaur","life","combin","puppetri","animatron","good","cgi","stock","footag","raptor","planet","wrong","look","effect","see","low","budget","gore","effect","even","unconvinc","plot","involv","bunch","commando","reason","forget","travel","planet","alien","dinosaur","right","folk","dinosaur","alien","dinosaur","outer","space","next","shark","space","rest","plot","simpl","human","cast","pick","eat","come","expect","numer","dinosaur","novel","releas","killer","dinosaur","see","actual","becom","bore","dinosaur","attac

{"value":"This utterly dull, senseless, pointless, spiritless, and dumb movie isn't the final proof that the world can forget about Danny Boyle and his post-\"Trainspotting\" movies: \"The Beach\" already took care of that. What this low-budget oddity does is merely to secure his place among those who started very well but got completely lost in drugs, booze, ego, self-delusion, bad management or whatever it was that lead to this once-promising director's quick demise.<br /><br />The premise is absurd: two losers (Ecclestone and some bimbo Jenna G - a rapper, likely) meet by chance and spontaneously start singing with fervour more akin to lunatic asylum inhabitants than a potential hit-making duo - which they become. A friend of theirs - an even bigger illiterate loser - becomes their manager by smashing a store window and stealing a video-camera by which he films them in \"action\", and then shows the tape to some music people who actually show interest in this garbage. Now, I know that the UK in recent years has put out incredible junk, but this is ridiculous; the music makes Oasis seem like The Beatles. During the studio recordings, the duo - Strumpet - change lyrics in every take and Ecclestone quite arrogantly tells the music biz guys to take it or leave it, and quite absurdly they do take it. Not only is the music total and utter trash, but its \"performers\" are anti-social; these NEWCOMERS are supposed to be calling the shots. It's just too dumb. It's plain awful.<br /><br />The dialog is unfunny and goes nowhere, and this rags-to-bitches story has no point and makes no sense. It often feels improvised - under the influence of drugs. Danny Boyle is a complete idiot. This little piece of trash is so bad it's embarrassing to watch. Ecclestone's I.Q. also has to be questioned for agreeing to be part of this nonsense. Whoever financed this £1000 joke should leave the movie business before they end up selling their own underwear on street corners.","finished_norm":["thi","utterli","dull","senseless","pointless","spiritless","and","dumb","movi","be","not","the","final","proof","that","the","world","can","forget","about","danni","boyl","and","hi","posttrainspot","movi","the","beach","alreadi","take","care","of","that","what","thi","lowbudget","odditi","doe","be","mere","to","secur","hi","place","among","that","who","start","veri","good","but","get","complet","lose","in","drug","booz","ego","selfdelus","bad","manag","or","whatev","it","be","that","lead","to","thi","oncepromis","director","quick","demisebr","br","the","premis","be","absurd","two","loser","eccleston","and","some","bimbo","jenna","g","a","rapper","like","meet","by","chanc","and","spontan","start","sing","with","fervour","much","akin","to","lunat","asylum","inhabit","than","a","potenti","hitmak","duo","which","thei","becom","a","friend","of","their","a","even","big","illiter","loser","becom","their","manag","by","smash","a","store","window","and","steal","a","videocamera","by","which","he","film","them","in","action","and","then","show","the","tape","to","some","music","peopl","who","actual","show","interest","in","thi","garbag","now","i","know","that","the","uk","in","recent","year","have","put","out","incred","junk","but","thi","be","ridicul","the","music","make","oasi","seem","like","the","beatl","dure","the","studio","record","the","duo","strumpet","chang","lyric","in","everi","take","and","eccleston","quit","arrogantli","tell","the","music","biz","gui","to","take","it","or","leav","it","and","quit","absurdli","thei","do","take","it","not","onli","be","the","music","total","and","utter","trash","but","it","perform","be","antisoci","thi","newcom","be","suppos","to","be","call","the","shot","it","just","too","dumb","it","plain","awfulbr","br","the","dialog","be","unfunni","and","go","nowher","and","thi","ragstobitch","stori","have","no","point","and","make","no","sens","it","often","feel","improvis","under","the","influenc","of","drug","danni","boyl","be","a","complet","idiot","thi","littl","piec","of","trash","be","so","bad","it","embarrass","to","watch","eccleston","iq","conjur","have","to","be","question","for","agre","to","be","part","of","thi","nonsens","whoever","financ","thi","joke","should","leav","the","movi","busi","befor","thei","end","up","sell","their","own","underwear","on","street","corner"],"filtered":["thi","utterli","dull","senseless","pointless","spiritless","dumb","movi","final","proof","world","forget","danni","boyl","hi","posttrainspot","movi","beach","alreadi","take","care","thi","lowbudget","odditi","doe","mere","secur","hi","place","among","start","veri","good","get","complet","lose","drug","booz","ego","selfdelus","bad","manag","whatev","lead","thi","oncepromis","director","quick","demisebr","br","premis","absurd","two","loser","eccleston","bimbo","jenna","g","rapper","like","meet","chanc","spontan","start","sing","fervour","much","akin","lunat","asylum","inhabit","potenti","hitmak","duo","thei","becom","friend","even","big","illiter","loser","becom","manag","smash","store","window","steal","videocamera","film","action","show","tape","music","peopl","actual","show","interest","thi","garbag","know","uk","recent","year","put","incred","junk","thi","ridicul","music","make","oasi","seem","like","beatl","dure","studio","record","duo","strumpet","chang","lyric","everi","take","eccleston","quit","arrogantli","tell","music","biz","gui","take","leav","quit","absurdli","thei","take","onli","music","total","utter","trash","perform","antisoci","thi","newcom","suppos","call","shot","dumb","plain","awfulbr","br","dialog","unfunni","go","nowher","thi","ragstobitch","stori","point","make","sens","often","feel","improvis","influenc","drug","danni","boyl","complet","idiot","thi","littl","piec","trash","bad","embarrass","watch","eccleston","iq","conjur","question","agre","part","thi","nonsens","whoever","financ","thi","joke","leav","movi","busi","befor","thei","end","sell","underwear","street","corner"],"filtered2":["utterli","dull","senseless","pointless","spiritless","dumb","final","proof","world","forget","danni","boyl","posttrainspot","beach","alreadi","take","care","lowbudget","odditi","doe","mere","secur","place","among","start","veri","good","get","complet","lose","drug","booz","ego","selfdelus","bad","manag","whatev","lead","oncepromis","director","quick","demisebr","premis","absurd","two","loser","eccleston","bimbo","jenna","g","rapper","like","meet","chanc","spontan","start","sing","fervour","akin","lunat","asylum","inhabit","potenti","hitmak","duo","becom","friend","even","big","illiter","loser","becom","manag","smash","store","window","steal","videocamera","action","show","tape","music","peopl","actual","show","interest","garbag","know","uk","recent","year","put","incred","junk","ridicul","music","make","oasi","seem","like","beatl","dure","studio","record","duo","strumpet","chang","lyric","everi","take","eccleston","quit","arrogantli","tell","music","biz","gui"

{"value":"This is a film that had a lot to live down to . on the year of its release legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and I'd heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated <br /><br />To be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word \" plot \" is used because as far as I can see there is no plot as such . There's something involving Russian gangsters , a character called Pete Thompson who's trying to get his wife Sarah pregnant , and an Irish bloke called Sean . How they all fit into something called a \" plot \" I'm not sure . It's difficult to explain the plots of Guy Ritchie films but if you watch any of his films I'm sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing . Likewise a James Bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes . You will have a serious problem believing RANCID ALUMINIUM has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained <br /><br />Taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you'll be watching . Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and she's doing nothing to become inconsistent . Steven Berkoff gives acting a bad name ( and he plays a character called Kant which sums up the wit of this movie ) while one of the supporting characters is played by a TV presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this <br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's utterly forgettable . I saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching I was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching , but by now I've mainly forgotten why . But this doesn't alter the fact that I remember disliking this piece of crap

{"value":"No wonder that the historian Ian Kershaw, author of the groundbreaking Hitler biography, who originally was the scientific consultant for this TV film, dissociated himself from it. The film is historically just too incorrect. The mistakes start right away when Hitler`s father Alois dies at home, while in reality he died in a pub. In the film, Hitler moves from Vienna to Munich in 1914, while in reality he actually moved to Munich in 1913. I could go on endlessly. Hitler`s childhood and youth are portrayed way too short, which makes it quite difficult for historically uninformed people to understand the character of this frustrated neurotic man. Important persons of the early time of the party, like Hitler`s fatherly friend Dietrich Eckart or the party \"philosopher\" Alfred Rosenberg are totally missing. The characterization of Ernst Hanfstaengl is very problematic. In the film he is portrayed as a noble character who almost despises Hitler. The script obviously follows Hanfstaengl`s own gloss over view of himself which he gave in his biography after the war. In fact, Hanfstaengl was an anti-semite and was crazy about his \"Fuehrer\". But the biggest problem of the film is the portrayal of Hitler himself. He is characterized as someone who is constantly unfriendly,has neither charisma nor charm and constantly orders everybody around. After watching the film, one wonders, how such a disgusting person ever was able to get any followers. Since we all know, what an evil criminal Hitler was, naturally every scriptwriter is tempted to portray Hitler as totally disgusting and uncharismatic. But facts is, that in private he could be quite charming and entertaining. His comrades didn`t follow him because he constantly yelled at them, but because they liked this strange man. Beyond all those historical mistakes, the film is well made, the actors are first class, the location shots and the production design give a believable impression of the era.","finished_norm":["no","wonder","that","the","historian","ian","kershaw","author","of","the","groundbreak","hitler","biographi","who","origin","be","the","scientif","consult","for","thi","tv","film","dissoci","himself","from","it","the","film","be","histor","just","too","incorrect","the","mistak","start","right","awai","when","hitler","father","aloi","die","at","home","while","in","realiti","he","die","in","a","pub","in","the","film","hitler","move","from","vienna","to","munich","in","while","in","realiti","he","actual","move","to","munich","in","i","can","go","on","endlessli","hitler","childhood","and","youth","be","portrai","wai","too","short","which","make","it","quit","difficult","for","histor","uninform","peopl","to","understand","the","charact","of","thi","frustrat","neurot","man","import","person","of","the","earli","time","of","the","parti","like","hitler","fatherli","friend","dietrich","eckart","or","the","parti","philosoph","alfr","rosenberg","be","total","miss","the","character","of","ernst","hanfstaengl","be","veri","problemat","in","the","film","he","be","portrai","a","a","nobl","charact","who","almost","despis","hitler","the","script","obvious","follow","hanfstaengl","own","gloss","over","view","of","himself","which","he","give","in","hi","biographi","after","the","war","in","fact","hanfstaengl","be","a","antisemit","and","be","crazi","about","hi","fuehrer","but","the","big","problem","of","the","film","be","the","portray","of","hitler","himself","he","be","character","a","someon","who","be","constantli","unfriendlyha","neither","charisma","nor","charm","and","constantli","order","everybodi","around","after","watch","the","film","on","wonder","how","such","a","disgust","person","ever","be","abl","to","get","ani","follow","sinc","we","all","know","what","a","evil","crimin","hitler","be","natur","everi","scriptwrit","be","tempt","to","portrai","hitler","a","total","disgust","and","uncharismat","but","fact","be","that","in","privat","he","can","be","quit","charm","and","entertain","hi","comrad","didnt","follow","him","becaus","he","constantli","yell","at","them","but","becaus","thei","like","thi","strang","man","beyond","all","that","histor","mistak","the","film","be","good","make","the","actor","be","class","the","locat","shot","and","the","product","design","give","a","believ","impress","of","the","era"],"filtered":["wonder","historian","ian","kershaw","author","groundbreak","hitler","biographi","origin","scientif","consult","thi","tv","film","dissoci","film","histor","incorrect","mistak","start","right","awai","hitler","father","aloi","die","home","realiti","die","pub","film","hitler","move","vienna","munich","realiti","actual","move","munich","go","endlessli","hitler","childhood","youth","portrai","wai","short","make","quit","difficult","histor","uninform","peopl","understand","charact","thi","frustrat","neurot","man","import","person","earli","time","parti","like","hitler","fatherli","friend","dietrich","eckart","parti","philosoph","alfr","rosenberg","total","miss","character","ernst","hanfstaengl","veri","problemat","film","portrai","nobl","charact","almost","despis","hitler","script","obvious","follow","hanfstaengl","gloss","view","give","hi","biographi","war","fact","hanfstaengl","antisemit","crazi","hi","fuehrer","big","problem","film","portray","hitler","character","someon","constantli","unfriendlyha","neither","charisma","charm","constantli","order","everybodi","around","watch","film","wonder","disgust","person","ever","abl","get","ani","follow","sinc","know","evil","crimin","hitler","natur","everi","scriptwrit","tempt","portrai","hitler","total","disgust","uncharismat","fact","privat","quit","charm","entertain","hi","comrad","didnt","follow","becaus","constantli","yell","becaus","thei","like","thi","strang","man","beyond","histor","mistak","film","good","make","actor","class","locat","shot","product","design","give","believ","impress","era"],"filtered2":["wonder","historian","ian","kershaw","author","groundbreak","hitler","biographi","origin","scientif","consult","tv","dissoci","histor","incorrect","mistak","start","right","awai","hitler","father","aloi","die","home","realiti","die","pub","hitler","move","vienna","munich","realiti","actual","move","munich","go","endlessli","hitler","childhood","youth","portrai","wai","short","make","quit","difficult","histor","uninform","peopl","understand","charact","frustrat","neurot","man","import","person","earli","time","parti","like","hitler","fatherli","friend","dietrich","eckart","parti","philosoph","alfr","rosenberg","total","miss","character","ernst","hanfstaengl","veri","problemat","portrai","nobl","charact","almost","despis","hitler","script","obvious","follow","hanfstaengl","gloss","view","give","biographi","war","fact","hanfstaengl","antisemit","crazi","fuehrer","big","problem","portray","hitler","character","someon","constantli","unfriendlyha","neither","charisma","charm","constantli","order","everybodi","around","watch","wonder","

{"value":"This movie is possibly the cheapest, cheesiest, and poorest sequel ever made.<br /><br />Yet, it is the funniest and most idiotic movie by Disney, and will guarantee laughs at the sappy stories and lame plots from start to finish.<br /><br />It's a group of short stories that seem like bad fanfictions.<br /><br />*SPOILER ALERT* The first one's all about Beast and Belle being petty over a pathetic argument. Then, three loser new characters decide to patch things up by forging a letter of forgiveness to give to Belle. Part way through this little episode, Belle has wall eyes, which made my siblings and I laugh so hard. Then, she and the Beast fight more over the letter... and later learn the meaning of forgiveness. How old are they??? Certainly old enough to know the meaning of forgiveness.<br /><br />Then, the next one's all about Lumiere being the world's biggest dope when it comes to romance. This coming from the man who could woo anything female. And they make FiFi a psychotic villainess who tries to kill Belle, and winds up getting off scotch-free by the end of it. What a message to send the kids!<br /><br />Then, the next one's all about Mrs. Potts being angsty. And the next one after that's all about Beast becoming overly possessive of a bird, to the point where he just seems downright silly.<br /><br />The animation's so ugly, it kills. There are at least 100 mistakes you can plainly see... and the coloring is awful.<br /><br />Belle's a simpering sap who blubbers whenever something goes wrong. Plus, she's petty and very different from the usual Belle.<br /><br />And the side characters are annoying... (I mean, Cogsworth and Lumiere fight almost all the time. I know they did that in the movie, but it was overdone in this.)<br /><br />But the worst character is Mrs. Potts. She's ruined in this. I can't even describe it.

{"value":"I wanted to give Drawing Blood the benefit of the initial doubt. The opening moments, with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter, Diana, about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art, give the impression that this could be a kick-ass artsy-vampire flick. Turns out this initial impression turns out false. Oh, Troma, the mark of some kind of lack of quality: sometimes they'll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junk-food craft (or, sometimes not). This is a case where it's not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor (i.e. the protagonist's father is an old vaudevillian who does Jimmy Durante impressions?) are weak at best, and any unintentional laughs are undercut by Sergio Lapel's bargain basement direction.<br /><br />And it's not without him trying, oh Lord no. He does try a lot, which is a big part of the problem. He and his producers had money for lights, sure, but the way they're used in the movie made I, a former student filmmaker and aspiring director, sulking in my seat: if I saw this in a theater I would have to blind my eyes in many instances, and would wonder whether or not his DP understood really the basic 3-point lighting set-up. While this, along with a very lackluster sound design (or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene), shouldn't be something that comes to attention during a Troma release, it should be something *basic* that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script isn't very funny or scary (and it isn't) or if Lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments.<br /><br />It's not a good movie by any stretch, and perhaps if you're a vampire die-hard (or just a vampire period) it might have some appeal as a low-rent bargain basement alternative to Near Dark, or as a slight improvement over, say, 1972's Blood Freak. You have better ways to waste your time,

{"value":"This Film was done in really poor taste. The script was really bad. I feel really sad for the late Gregory Peck who took on the title role of this B-movie adaptation of one of history's greatest generals. The movie was politically incorrect and downright insensitive to the others who fought the Japanese in World War 2. There was a scene where I almost vomited, it showed Macarthur in a bunker in Corregidor island talking to the troops like a seasoned politician when he comes across a wounded, one legged Filipino soldier. The soldier bleeding and dying manages to sit up straight upon seeing the general and says : `no papa, no mama, no uncle sam' and Macarthur gives his little pep talk that Americans `would never abandon' the Philippines. The scene ends with the soldier being invigorated by Macarthur's words and gives him a smart salute. I mean if there was a more condescending scene portraying the U.S. as the great white savior of the world please tell me because this one takes the cake. It showed that Filipinos are damsels in distress incapable of honor and have to rely on the great Americans solely for redemption. It blatantly and purposely overshadowed the contributions of the members of the USAFFE (United States Armed Forces of The Far East), these are Filipino volunteers that were integrated in the US military during world war 2, who died side by side with the Americans fighting the Japanese, who walked side by side with Americans in the death march of Bataan and defended Corregidor island by launching a guerilla offensive after Macarthur left for Australia with his famous `I shall return' speech. My late grandfather, a Filipino world war 2 veteran and USAFFE soldier was one of the many who fought the Japanese with honor and love for the home country. I think this movie does not give honor to them and to the thousands of others that Macarthur relied on for intelligence preparations for his famous return in the Leyte gulf landing.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","do","in","realli","poor","tast","the","script","be","realli","bad","i","feel","realli","sad","for","the","late","gregori","peck","who","take","on","the","titl","role","of","thi","bmovi","adapt","of","on","of","histori","great","gener","the","movi","be","polit","incorrect","and","downright","insensit","to","the","other","who","fight","the","japanes","in","world","war","there","be","a","scene","where","i","almost","vomit","it","show","macarthur","in","a","bunker","in","corregidor","island","talk","to","the","troop","like","a","season","politician","when","he","come","across","a","wound","on","leg","filipino","soldier","the","soldier","ble","and","dye","manag","to","sit","up","straight","upon","see","the","gener","and","sai","no","papa","no","mama","no","uncl","sam","and","macarthur","give","hi","littl","pep","talk","that","american","would","never","abandon","the","philippin","the","scene","end","with","the","soldier","be","invigor","by","macarthur","word","and","give","him","a","smart","salut","i","mean","if","there","be","a","much","condescend","scene","portrai","the","u","a","the","great","white","savior","of","the","world","pleas","tell","me","becaus","thi","on","take","the","cake","it","show","that","filipino","be","damsel","in","distress","incap","of","honor","and","have","to","reli","on","the","great","american","sole","for","redempt","it","blatantli","and","purpos","overshadow","the","contribut","of","the","member","of","the","usaff","unit","state","arm","forc","of","the","far","east","thi","be","filipino","volunt","that","be","integr","in","the","u","militari","dure","world","war","who","die","side","by","side","with","the","american","fight","the","japanes","who","walk","side","by","side","with","american","in","the","death","march","of","bataan","and","defend","corregidor","island","by","launch","a","guerilla","offens","after","macarthur","leav","for","australia","with","hi","famou","i","shall","return","speech","my","late","grandfath","a","filipino","world","war","veteran","and","usaff","soldier","be","on","of","the","mani","who","fight","the","japanes","with","honor","and","love","for","the","home","countri","i","think","thi","movi","doe","not","give","honor","to","them","and","to","the","thousand","of","other","that","macarthur","reli","on","for","intellig","prepar","for","hi","famou","return","in","the","leyt","gulf","land"],"filtered":["thi","film","realli","poor","tast","script","realli","bad","feel","realli","sad","late","gregori","peck","take","titl","role","thi","bmovi","adapt","histori","great","gener","movi","polit","incorrect","downright","insensit","fight","japanes","world","war","scene","almost","vomit","show","macarthur","bunker","corregidor","island","talk","troop","like","season","politician","come","across","wound","leg","filipino","soldier","soldier","ble","dye","manag","sit","straight","upon","see","gener","sai","papa","mama","uncl","sam","macarthur","give","hi","littl","pep","talk","american","never","abandon","philippin","scene","end","soldier","invigor","macarthur","word","give","smart","salut","mean","much","condescend","scene","portrai","u","great","white","savior","world","pleas","tell","becaus","thi","take","cake","show","filipino","damsel","distress","incap","honor","reli","great","american","sole","redempt","blatantli","purpos","overshadow","contribut","member","usaff","unit","state","arm","forc","far","east","thi","filipino","volunt","integr","u","militari","dure","world","war","die","side","side","american","fight","japanes","walk","side","side","american","death","march","bataan","defend","corregidor","island","launch","guerilla","offens","macarthur","leav","australia","hi","famou","shall","return","speech","late","grandfath","filipino","world","war","veteran","usaff","soldier","mani","fight","japanes","honor","love","home","countri","think","thi","movi","doe","give","honor","thousand","macarthur","reli","intellig","prepar","hi","famou","return","leyt","gulf","land"],"filtered2":["realli","poor","tast","script","realli","bad","feel","realli","sad","late","gregori","peck","take","titl","role","bmovi","adapt","histori","great","gener","polit","incorrect","downright","insensit","fight","japanes","world","war","scene","almost","vomit","show","macarthur","bunker","corregidor","island","talk","troop","like","season","politician","come","across","wound","leg","filipino","soldier","soldier","ble","dye","manag","sit","straight","upon","see","gener","papa","mama","uncl","sam","macarthur","give","littl","pep","talk","american","never","abandon","philippin","scene","end","soldier","invigor","macarthur","word","give","smart","salut","mean","condescend","scene","portrai","u","great","white","savior","world","pleas","tell","becaus","take","cake","show","filipino","damsel","distress","incap","honor","reli","great","american","sole","redempt","blatantli","purpos","overshadow","contribut","member","usaff","unit","state","arm","forc","far",

{"value":"Wow...I can't believe just how bad ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH!T 3) really is. I'd heard the rumors, read the reviews - but had to make my mind up for myself. Well, let me tell ya - IT BLOWS!!! The worst acting of any film ever made, dubbing that must have been done while everyone involved was completely wasted, inept and laughable gore FX, no discernible plot, \"cinematography\" that looks like my grandma filmed it with her camcorder, weapons props that are no joke - made out of tin-foil - the list goes on and on...<br /><br />Three guys get stranded on an island where a bunch of weirdos run around with plastic and tin-foil swords. Two of the captives are freed along with a rebel of the island freaks, and are given a day's head start before they are hunted down by the rest of the \"tribe\"...that's pretty much it...<br /><br />Honestly - this is one of THE WORST films I've ever had the misfortune to subject myself too. The budget had to be about $200 and was spent entirely on the gore FX (which actually may not have been a bad idea...). There is NOTHING to ZOMBIE DOOM other than strung-together ridiculous looking gore scenes with lots of HORRIBLY dubbed dialog. This film makes other no-budget outings like PREMUTOS: LORD OF THE LIVING DEAD look like TITANIC. Some may rank ZD in the \"so-bad-it's-good\" category - and I guess if you're REALLY drunk or high and watching it with a few friends MST3K-style - I guess it could be looked at that way. But not by me. I hated pretty much everything about it. If ZOMBIE DOOM or ZOMBIE 90 (which is equally appalling and is included as a \"bonus\" on the Shock-O-Rama release of ZD) is indicative of Andreas Schnaas' other works - then he should be banned from ever having anything to do with making a film ever again under penalty of death. There is one amusing kung-fu battle in the latter half of the film, and a lot of blood - so I'll grant this one a VERY generous 3/10 - Do yourself a favor and skip this.","finished_norm":["wowi","ca","not","believ","just","how","bad","zombi","doom","aka","violent","sht","realli","be","i","have","hear","the","rumor","read","the","review","but","have","to","make","my","mind","up","for","myself","good","let","me","tell","you","it","blow","the","wrong","act","of","ani","film","ever","make","dub","that","must","have","be","do","while","everyon","involv","be","complet","wast","inept","and","laughabl","gore","fx","no","discern","plot","cinematographi","that","look","like","my","grandma","film","it","with","her","camcord","weapon","prop","that","be","no","joke","make","out","of","tinfoil","the","list","go","on","and","onbr","br","three","gui","get","strand","on","a","island","where","a","bunch","of","weirdo","run","around","with","plastic","and","tinfoil","sword","two","of","the","captiv","be","free","along","with","a","rebel","of","the","island","freak","and","be","give","a","dai","head","start","befor","thei","be","hunt","down","by","the","rest","of","the","tribethat","pretti","much","itbr","br","honestli","thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","have","the","misfortun","to","subject","myself","too","the","budget","have","to","be","about","and","be","spend","entir","on","the","gore","fx","which","actual","mai","not","have","be","a","bad","idea","there","be","noth","to","zombi","doom","other","than","strungtogeth","ridicul","look","gore","scene","with","lot","of","horribli","dub","dialog","thi","film","make","other","nobudget","out","like","premuto","lord","of","the","live","dead","look","like","titan","some","mai","rank","zd","in","the","sobaditsgood","categori","and","i","guess","if","you","re","realli","drink","or","high","and","watch","it","with","a","few","friend","mstkstyl","i","guess","it","can","be","look","at","that","wai","but","not","by","me","i","hate","pretti","much","everyth","about","it","if","zombi","doom","or","zombi","which","be","equal","appal","and","be","includ","a","a","bonu","on","the","shockorama","releas","of","zd","be","indic","of","andrea","schnaa","other","work","then","he","should","be","ban","from","ever","have","anyth","to","do","with","make","a","film","ever","again","under","penalti","of","death","there","be","on","amus","kungfu","battl","in","the","latter","half","of","the","film","and","a","lot","of","blood","so","i","will","grant","thi","on","a","veri","gener","do","yourself","a","favor","and","skip","thi"],"filtered":["wowi","ca","believ","bad","zombi","doom","aka","violent","sht","realli","hear","rumor","read","review","make","mind","good","let","tell","blow","wrong","act","ani","film","ever","make","dub","must","everyon","involv","complet","wast","inept","laughabl","gore","fx","discern","plot","cinematographi","look","like","grandma","film","camcord","weapon","prop","joke","make","tinfoil","list","go","onbr","br","three","gui","get","strand","island","bunch","weirdo","run","around","plastic","tinfoil","sword","two","captiv","free","along","rebel","island","freak","give","dai","head","start","befor","thei","hunt","rest","tribethat","pretti","much","itbr","br","honestli","thi","wrong","film","ever","misfortun","subject","budget","spend","entir","gore","fx","actual","mai","bad","idea","noth","zombi","doom","strungtogeth","ridicul","look","gore","scene","lot","horribli","dub","dialog","thi","film","make","nobudget","like","premuto","lord","live","dead","look","like","titan","mai","rank","zd","sobaditsgood","categori","guess","re","realli","drink","high","watch","friend","mstkstyl","guess","look","wai","hate","pretti","much","everyth","zombi","doom","zombi","equal","appal","includ","bonu","shockorama","releas","zd","indic","andrea","schnaa","work","ban","ever","anyth","make","film","ever","penalti","death","amus","kungfu","battl","latter","half","film","lot","blood","grant","thi","veri","gener","favor","skip","thi"],"filtered2":["wowi","ca","believ","bad","zombi","doom","aka","violent","sht","realli","hear","rumor","read","review","make","mind","good","let","tell","blow","wrong","act","ani","ever","make","dub","must","everyon","involv","complet","wast","inept","laughabl","gore","fx","discern","plot","cinematographi","look","like","grandma","camcord","weapon","prop","joke","make","tinfoil","list","go","onbr","three","gui","get","strand","island","bunch","weirdo","run","around","plastic","tinfoil","sword","two","captiv","free","along","rebel","island","freak","give","dai","head","start","befor","hunt","rest","tribethat","pretti","itbr","honestli","wrong","ever","misfortun","subject","budget","spend","entir","gore","fx","actual","mai","bad","idea","noth","zombi","doom","strungtogeth","ridicul","look","gore","scene","lot","horribli","dub","dialog","make","nobudget","like","premuto","lord","live","dead","look","like","titan","mai","rank","zd","sobaditsgood","categori","guess","re","realli","drink","high","watch","friend","mstkstyl","guess","look","wai","hate","pretti","everyth","zombi","doom","zombi","equal","appal","includ","

{"value":"This may have been based on historical events, and we know that the makers of this TV docu-drama took liberties to make it more dramatic - I can live with that - but it was just so badly done! I was amazed in the event of an unfolding mid-air crisis how calm everyone seemed, surely someone would have panicked, and what a smooth flight, no passenger discomfort apparent - come on! Not sure about the regulations, nowadays some of the airline security stuff seems OTT nonsense, but why take your shoes off before the emergency landing, common sense tells me this is not a good idea! The shots of this massive airliner coming down on this remote airstrip were unconvincing and fake. In reality it would have been an awesome sight viewed from the ground nearby, in this movie it was out of proportion and looked like the model it probably was. Escape slides appeared at the front and mid emergency doors, yet nobody appeared to exit from the front, even though the drop was much less. The Captain went back into the plane after the landing - why? this was never explained. We know the emergency landing was due to being out of fuel, but even so there must have been some fuel sloshing around at the bottom of the tanks, and the risk of explosion must have been a very real danger, yet the evacuation seemed almost leisurely, and everyone stands around at the foot of the escape slides instead of getting as far away as possible, as I am sure I would have done. There were just too many inconsistencies, errors and faked action in this. I would have preferred to have seen a representation of the drama in real time, and with realistic motion of the plane portrayed. It had the potential to be quite thrilling, but doubtless due to the budget restrictions failed, and made one feel that a plane losing all engines was no big deal really, and you would safely glide down to a bit of a bumpy landing, but no real danger! - the reality of course being somewhat

{"value":"Well, on the endless quest for horror, we will come across this film, apparently re-released on DVD recently for some ungodly reason. The transfer is awful and the quality just sucks. I don't think this is due to a bad remaster or anything, I just think the film is poorly done.<br /><br />Obviously filmed at an abandoned school with a budget that was no doubt wasted on cheap beer and no talent hacks, \"Slaughter High\" starts out slow and doesn't pick up pace until about an hour in. First, we get to see a 'nerd' as he is picked on by a group of...I actually don't even know what they were supposed to be...jocks? The ringleader, with his ultra hooknose is so ugly he should have definitely been cast as the nerd. Then, there is a 'big guy' and a couple of dumb losers and chicks who are supposed to be 'hot' but aren't. It's a mystery why this group of rejects is picking on one of their own, but I guess the viewer is to assume these are 'cool kids' picking on a dweeb. The casting choices are horrendous as most of the high schoolers are played by thirty-somethings. As other reviewers on here have pointed out, the actors (if you can call them that,) are a bunch of Brits whose accents slip out numerous times throughout this piece of crap. We are left to assume that this group of 'children' were the only students at this school, as their 'reunion' is only them at the school, which is now shown to be abandoned, is just them.<br /><br />The kills are lame, the gore is not great and the script is like Scooby Doo with real people; lines like: 'This place gives me the creeps...' and 'Someone gimme a beer' are highlights...It's just not good. Skip this one unless you are getting wasted with some friends and wanna laugh at a real lame attempt at a slasher. If you wanna see good, get Bava's \"Bay Of Blood,\" done 14 years earlier and a heck of a lot better. If you wanna see a good BAD slasher, see \"Just Before Dawn\" or \"The Burning.\" 2 out of 10,

{"value":"I couldn't agree more with another reviewer that mentioned Jodorowsky.<br /><br />Barney seems to be utterly boring and uninspired \"content-wise\". He can produce eye-candy (and I like candy), but its pretentiousness and fundamental artistic emptiness just diminishes all the joy. <br /><br />I am afraid that many people don't distinguish between similar (but really only on the surface) works of Jodorowsky or even more linear film-makers like Tarkovski or Kubrick (I love 2001 Odyssey and was never bored through the ending scenes...) That kind of art as M.Barney's makes adds confusion and fends off the viewers that could otherwise start to appreciate experimental cinema. Typical empty post-modern \"conceptual\" art. And check his interviews. I just don't buy it, sorry. And so boring. <br /><br />I was never bored seeing Alejandro Jodorowsky's movies, while Drawing Restraint 9 was an utter disappointment. Especially while it offered the possibilities to be something, to actually tell something in a non-linear unorthodox way (like the beginning and the great choreographed dance and preparations for the ship to sail out. Ships \"meeting\" on the sea... Ideas of feces as an object of value(if it was feces). Those \"pearl\" divers... Everything could construct a great surreal movie with some content. But it didn't. ANd those horrible pretentious scenes of dressing up and fake tea ceremony... How vain and fake and philosophically pretentious but empty can it get?<br /><br />I has some great picturesque scenes, but the whole movie became so boring and pretentious and utterly empty and fake that it made me physically sick.<br /><br />And it doesn't have good tempo. I like slow pace movies, but this was just boring in some scenes - because it was pretentious and fake - so I was just forced to witnessed prolonged scenes of artistic vanity...<br /><br />That kind of movies just kill the art and spirit in my view. <br /><br />I want more

{"value":"CQ was the worst film I saw this year. Nearly every film I choose to see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say. This film looked like like it was directed by a film student for his Intro. to Filmmaking class. His father makes great films. His sister made a good one. But brother Roman? NO! One critic had the audacity to compare this film to Godard's Le Mépris (Contempt). While Coppola, Jr. did take the same idea, a film about film, he tried too hard to make himself seem European, artsy, and witty, when it's all really just kitsch. The lead actor carries the same expression through the whole film, like he's either in awe or in shock of this film being made around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to pull off his role as a flamboyant director. Depardieu is alright. The one scene that has any real film spoof humor at all is, surprisingly, not the B-movie scenes, but rather one which takes place in Italy; a montage of shots of several various characters inside a very small car, driving around picking up and dropping off random people. This was the only thing that reminded me of the cinema I am guessing he was trying to spoof. Or rip-off. Or both. The documentary with the lead talking into the camera and filming various objects has been played out, the ending was tagged on for the sake of a \"twist\" or artistic value... I suppose the funniest thing about this film was the film itself, and not in the way it intended. No wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re-edited or re-shot or whatever, which makes me curious as to just how bad it was before. I can't believe it could have been worse than this. If you want to see a good parody of film check out the Austin Powers films. Any of them. The opening to the third is more entertaining and more genius than this entire film. Lil' Romy, for the sake of cinema, PLEASE go back to directing your cousin's music videos.

{"value":"With all the excessive violence in this film, it could've been NC-17. But the gore could've been pg-13 and there were quite a lot of swears when the mum had the original jackass bad-hairdewed boy friend. There was a lot of character development which made the film better to watch, then after the kid came back to life as the scarecrow, there was a mindless hour and ten minutes of him killing people. The violence was overly excessive and i think the bodycount was higher than twelve which is a large number for movies like this. ALmost every character in the film is stabbed or gets their head chopped off, but the teacher who called him \"white trash\" and \"hoodlum\" (though the character lester is anything but a hoodlum, not even close, i know hoods and am part hood, they don't draw in class, they sit there and throw stuff at the teacher). The teacher deserved a more gruesome death than anyone of the characters, but was just stabbed in the back. There were two suspenseful scenes in the film, but didn't last long enough to be scary at all. As i said, the killings were excessive and sometimes people who have nothing to do with the story line get their heads chopped off. If the gore was actually fun to see, then it would've been nc-17. Two kids describe a body they find in the cornfields, they describe it as a lot gorier than it actually was, they explained to the cop that there were maggots crawling around in the guys intestines. His stomach had not even been cut open so there was no way maggots were in his stomach, though i would've liked to see that. The acting was pathetic, characters were losers, and the scarecrow could do a lot of gymnastix stunts. I suggest renting this movie for the death scenes, i wont see it again anytime soon, but i enjoyed the excessive violence. Also, don't bother with the sequel, i watched five minutes of it and was bored to death, it sounds good but isn't. The original scarecrow actually kept me

{"value":"I cannot say that Aag is the worst Bollywood film ever made, because I haven't seen every Bollywood film, but my imagination tells me that it could well be.<br /><br />This film seems like an attempt at artistic suicide on behalf of the director, and I for one be believe he has been successful in his mission. No A-list actor outside of this film would risk sharing the same billing as him for all the humiliation this film is bound to carry with it.<br /><br />But lets not just blame the director here, there is the cinematographer, who looks like he's rehearsing for the amateur home movie maker of the year award. There is the over dramatic score, that hopes to carry you to the next scene. The lighting man, who must have been holding a cigarette in one hand and light bulb on pole in the other, and hoping that the flame burning off the cigarette would add to that much needed light in every scene. And, of course the actors! Some of them are by no means newcomers, else all could be forgiven here. The ensemble of actors in Aag were put together to promote a new beginning and dimension to the re-make of India's most loved movie of all time, 'Sholay'. One must not forget that these actors were not forced in to this film, they are A-list and willing participants to something that, let's face it would surely have had high and eager public expectation??? So it begs the question, Amitabh aside (for now), did the other actors really believe their performances even attempted to better the original? Did Amitabh Bachchan read the script and believe that people would remember his dialogue in this farcical abomination of a film? Don't be stupid, of course he didn't, this was a demonstration to the public of how much money talks hence can make actors walk.<br /><br />I truly hope everyone involved is satisfied with what is truly a vulgar attempt to remake a classic film, which only succeeds in polluting everyone's mind when they watch the original.","finished_norm":["i","cannot","sai","that","aag","be","the","wrong","bollywood","film","ever","make","becaus","i","have","not","see","everi","bollywood","film","but","my","imagin","tell","me","that","it","can","good","bebr","br","thi","film","seem","like","a","attempt","at","artist","suicid","on","behalf","of","the","director","and","i","for","on","be","believ","he","have","be","success","in","hi","mission","no","alist","actor","outsid","of","thi","film","would","risk","share","the","same","bill","a","him","for","all","the","humili","thi","film","be","bind","to","carri","with","itbr","br","but","let","not","just","blame","the","director","here","there","be","the","cinematograph","who","look","like","he","rehears","for","the","amateur","home","movi","maker","of","the","year","award","there","be","the","over","dramat","score","that","hope","to","carri","you","to","the","next","scene","the","light","man","who","must","have","be","hold","a","cigarett","in","on","hand","and","light","bulb","on","pole","in","the","other","and","hope","that","the","flame","burn","off","the","cigarett","would","add","to","that","much","ne","light","in","everi","scene","and","of","cours","the","actor","some","of","them","be","by","no","mean","newcom","els","all","can","be","forgiv","here","the","ensembl","of","actor","in","aag","be","put","togeth","to","promot","a","new","begin","and","dimens","to","the","remak","of","india","much","love","movi","of","all","time","sholai","on","must","not","forget","that","thi","actor","be","not","forc","in","to","thi","film","thei","be","alist","and","will","particip","to","someth","that","let","face","it","would","sure","have","have","high","and","eager","public","expect","so","it","beg","the","question","amitabh","asid","for","now","do","the","other","actor","realli","believ","their","perform","even","attempt","to","well","the","origin","do","amitabh","bachchan","read","the","script","and","believ","that","peopl","would","rememb","hi","dialogu","in","thi","farcic","abomin","of","a","film","do","not","be","stupid","of","cours","he","do","not","thi","be","a","demonstr","to","the","public","of","how","much","monei","talk","henc","can","make","actor","walkbr","br","i","truli","hope","everyon","involv","be","satisfi","with","what","be","truli","a","vulgar","attempt","to","remak","a","classic","film","which","onli","succ","in","pollut","everyon","mind","when","thei","watch","the","origin"],"filtered":["sai","aag","wrong","bollywood","film","ever","make","becaus","see","everi","bollywood","film","imagin","tell","good","bebr","br","thi","film","seem","like","attempt","artist","suicid","behalf","director","believ","success","hi","mission","alist","actor","outsid","thi","film","risk","share","bill","humili","thi","film","bind","carri","itbr","br","let","blame","director","cinematograph","look","like","rehears","amateur","home","movi","maker","year","award","dramat","score","hope","carri","next","scene","light","man","must","hold","cigarett","hand","light","bulb","pole","hope","flame","burn","cigarett","add","much","ne","light","everi","scene","cours","actor","mean","newcom","els","forgiv","ensembl","actor","aag","put","togeth","promot","new","begin","dimens","remak","india","much","love","movi","time","sholai","must","forget","thi","actor","forc","thi","film","thei","alist","particip","someth","let","face","sure","high","eager","public","expect","beg","question","amitabh","asid","actor","realli","believ","perform","even","attempt","well","origin","amitabh","bachchan","read","script","believ","peopl","rememb","hi","dialogu","thi","farcic","abomin","film","stupid","cours","thi","demonstr","public","much","monei","talk","henc","make","actor","walkbr","br","truli","hope","everyon","involv","satisfi","truli","vulgar","attempt","remak","classic","film","onli","succ","pollut","everyon","mind","thei","watch","origin"],"filtered2":["aag","wrong","bollywood","ever","make","becaus","see","everi","bollywood","imagin","tell","good","bebr","seem","like","attempt","artist","suicid","behalf","director","believ","success","mission","alist","actor","outsid","risk","share","bill","humili","bind","carri","itbr","let","blame","director","cinematograph","look","like","rehears","amateur","home","maker","year","award","dramat","score","hope","carri","next","scene","light","man","must","hold","cigarett","hand","light","bulb","pole","hope","flame","burn","cigarett","add","ne","light","everi","scene","cours","actor","mean","newcom","els","forgiv","ensembl","actor","aag","put","togeth","promot","new","begin","dimens","remak","india","love","time","sholai","must","forget","actor","forc","alist","particip","someth","let","face","sure","high","eager","public","expect","beg","question","amitabh","asid","actor","realli","believ","perform","even","attempt","well","origin","amitabh","bachchan","read","script","believ","peopl","rememb","dialogu","farcic","abomin","stupid","cours","demonstr","public","monei","talk","henc","make","a

{"value":"This movie was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Here are the things that immediately jump out at me: 1. The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles with a couple trees and brush. Not scary whatsoever. News flash, if you are filming in the Southern California area, big bear is only an hour away. They actually have trees there.<br /><br />2. The writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue I have ever experienced. Every possible line in the movie was unoriginal, cliché, or just plain stupid. For instance the name of the camp is \"camp blood\" (lame), the name of the clown is \"the killer clown\" (lame). What is a clown doing in a forest anyway? Was that the only mask they could find? 3. The last but certainly the least was the acting. Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled. A virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting. Worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph. It's a really long scene and I guess she was supposed to be sexy, but she was NOT. Also, and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me, was this tool who is supposed to be \"athletic.\" For instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them. Then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very \"girl like\" run, that he is quite far from athletic. Oh and to the girl who played Kat, good Lord stop singing. That song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself.<br /><br />If for some reason you do see this movie, I would at least recommend watching the special features. The group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story. In fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending.

{"value":"Before this made for TV movie began, I had relatively low expectations. That's because it was made after the final episode of the series had aired and many of the series originals were gone. There is no President Sheridan, Delenn, Lennier, Londo, Vir, G'kar or Lyta. If you remember, on the second to last episode of the series, all the regulars except Zack, Vir and Captain Lockley left B-5 permanently. Now for this film they did bring back Garibaldi (who was not in the last B-5 movie) to join Zack and the Captain and the Doctor makes a brief and irrelevant appearance. But because so much is gone of the old chemistry, this film already is severely handicapped.<br /><br />The movie is about a Soul Hunter (Martin Sheen) who is led to Babylon 5 in search of a globe filled with souls that had been stolen from a hidden repository by an archaeologist (Ian McShane). A lot of spooky mumbo-jumbo stuff occurs but frankly it was all pretty silly and pointless. Yeah, yeah, the station nearly blew up but was saved and all, but frankly I felt like it was a case of \"been there done that--and done that a lot better in the past\".<br /><br />The secondary plot, provided more for comic relief, was much more interesting, as an entrepreneur installed a holo-brothel and those in command weren't sure what to do about it and when they tried to pressure them to close, they were slapped with a lawsuit. This was fluff, but it did provide a few laughs--something the other dreary plot was surely lacking.<br /><br />By the way, Sheen at first did a good job playing the Should Hunter--with his wild eyes and bizarre delivery. However, repeatedly throughout the episode he fell out of character. This should have been spotted and corrected.<br /><br />So the final verdict is this is only for total die-hard B-5 nuts (like myself). Others seeing it might assume the series sucked--which is a great injustice.

{"value":"{rant start} I didn't want to believe them at first, but I guess this is what people are talking about when they say South Korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill. After the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie \"Gwoemul\" (aka \"The Host\") of 2006-- which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a B-movie genre-- successive Korean blockbusters have become more and more generic, even though their budgets (mainly spent on special effects) have become more and more fantastic. Do South Korean movie-makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill, which their industry has built up since the 1999 break-out film \"Shiri/Swiri\", by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland China did? {rant end}<br /><br />The only \"reason\" I can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a Korean/ East Asian-styled dragon I have seen to date, for the final scenes. Now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the 1996 \"Dragonheart\", the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons. Remember \"Dungeons & Dragons\" in 2000? Hasn't anyone learnt that the trick is not how MUCH special effects you use, but how WELL you use it? I hope there are more (and better) Korean legends they can use, because they have just killed a lot of international interest in Korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one.<br /><br />In short, I agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how Koreans felt about having their folk anthem \"Arirang\" being played at the very end. As a creature feature, I would have given it at least 5 stars out of 10 if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it, but I've seen many video games with better camera work and scripting (just less dragons).","finished_norm":["rant","start","i","do","not","want","to","believ","them","at","but","i","guess","thi","be","what","peopl","be","talk","about","when","thei","sai","south","korean","cinema","have","peak","and","mai","even","be","go","downhil","after","the","surprisingli","fun","and","move","monster","movi","gwoemul","aka","the","host","of","which","actual","succ","in","make","a","sharp","satir","out","of","a","bmovi","genr","success","korean","blockbust","have","becom","much","and","much","gener","even","though","their","budget","mainli","spend","on","special","effect","have","becom","much","and","much","fantast","do","south","korean","moviemak","realli","want","to","squander","all","the","audienc","and","investor","goodwil","which","their","industri","have","build","up","sinc","the","breakout","film","shiriswiri","by","make","a","whole","seri","of","big","budget","mediocr","movi","like","mainland","china","do","rant","endbr","br","the","onli","reason","i","can","fathom","for","make","thi","movi","be","to","dupe","the","investor","into","financ","the","much","detail","and","fluid","digit","anim","of","a","korean","east","asianstyl","dragon","i","have","see","to","date","for","the","final","scene","now","if","thei","have","introduc","that","dragon","at","the","begin","and","give","it","much","person","and","purpos","like","in","the","dragonheart","the","movi","mai","have","have","a","few","much","redeem","qualiti","other","than","have","lot","of","digit","anim","dragon","rememb","dungeon","dragon","in","have","not","anyon","learn","that","the","trick","be","not","how","much","special","effect","you","us","but","how","good","you","us","it","i","hope","there","be","much","and","well","korean","legend","thei","can","us","becaus","thei","have","just","kill","a","lot","of","intern","interest","in","korean","dragon","legend","with","the","wai","thei","film","thi","onebr","br","in","short","i","agre","with","all","the","neg","review","go","befor","and","wonder","how","korean","feel","about","have","their","folk","anthem","arirang","be","plai","at","the","veri","end","a","a","creatur","featur","i","would","have","give","it","at","littl","star","out","of","if","the","special","effect","or","action","sequenc","have","be","worth","it","but","i","have","see","mani","video","game","with","well","camera","work","and","script","just","littl","dragon"],"filtered":["rant","start","want","believ","guess","thi","peopl","talk","thei","sai","south","korean","cinema","peak","mai","even","go","downhil","surprisingli","fun","move","monster","movi","gwoemul","aka","host","actual","succ","make","sharp","satir","bmovi","genr","success","korean","blockbust","becom","much","much","gener","even","though","budget","mainli","spend","special","effect","becom","much","much","fantast","south","korean","moviemak","realli","want","squander","audienc","investor","goodwil","industri","build","sinc","breakout","film","shiriswiri","make","whole","seri","big","budget","mediocr","movi","like","mainland","china","rant","endbr","br","onli","reason","fathom","make","thi","movi","dupe","investor","financ","much","detail","fluid","digit","anim","korean","east","asianstyl","dragon","see","date","final","scene","thei","introduc","dragon","begin","give","much","person","purpos","like","dragonheart","movi","mai","much","redeem","qualiti","lot","digit","anim","dragon","rememb","dungeon","dragon","anyon","learn","trick","much","special","effect","us","good","us","hope","much","well","korean","legend","thei","us","becaus","thei","kill","lot","intern","interest","korean","dragon","legend","wai","thei","film","thi","onebr","br","short","agre","neg","review","go","befor","wonder","korean","feel","folk","anthem","arirang","plai","veri","end","creatur","featur","give","littl","star","special","effect","action","sequenc","worth","see","mani","video","game","well","camera","work","script","littl","dragon"],"filtered2":["rant","start","want","believ","guess","peopl","talk","south","korean","cinema","peak","mai","even","go","downhil","surprisingli","fun","move","monster","gwoemul","aka","host","actual","succ","make","sharp","satir","bmovi","genr","success","korean","blockbust","becom","gener","even","though","budget","mainli","spend","special","effect","becom","fantast","south","korean","moviemak","realli","want","squander","audienc","investor","goodwil","industri","build","sinc","breakout","shiriswiri","make","whole","big","budget","mediocr","like","mainland","china","rant","endbr","onli","reason","fathom","make","dupe","investor","financ","detail","fluid","digit","anim","korean","east","asianstyl","dragon","see","date","final","scene","introduc","dragon","begin","give","person","purpos","like","dragonheart","mai","redeem","qualiti","lot","digit","anim","dragon","rememb","dungeon","dragon","anyon","learn","trick","special","effect","us","good","us","hope","well","korean","legend","us","becaus","kill","lot","intern","interest","korean","dragon","legend","wai",

{"value":"Because that's all she does through out this whole movie,is get naked for no good reason.When Tarzan is bitten by a snake,she suddenly removes her clothes.Since when is a boa constrictor poisonous?How did Tarzan get poisoned by the way ? This whole movie is screwed up.They couldn't get the species of animals for this movie right.Whats an Orangutang doing hanging around those chimpanzees?He must have wandered off the set of a much better film.The group of cannibal tribe's men look caucasin.Why?And why was Bo and her dad painted,if they were going to be eaten later?It was probably just a lame excuse to show her breasts and curves again.Her dad while hunting, approaches and acts stupidly around a bull elephant while standing too close to it.Any real African bull elephant that wasn't from the circus,would've stomped this moron's butt.Any smart hunter would've started shooting the minute he saw it.And I can't help but wonder if the camera was on LSD,because it kept showing various scenes that went in slow motion, for no good reason.It didn't make good sense at all.The boa constrictor that Tarzan wrestled with in the water,looks like one of those 12 Ft rubber snakes you can buy at a local Spencer Gifts.Tarzan was strangly speechless in this film,maybe from Bo flashing herself so much.I'm sorry,but this is a rip off of a classic Black and White Tarzan movie,with a similar but better story.Not To mention plotting .There's one scene in that I saw that everyone forgot to mention.*(SPOILERS ALERT)*The scene where he is trying to rescue Jane and her dad,has him standing too close to a running water

{"value":"I'm only rating this film as a 3 out of pity because it attempts to be worthwhile. I love to praise a great movie and I'm not biased toward \"male\" movies. Legally blonde was an excellent film. Georgia Rule on the other hand, was a disorganized, weak, poorly written, unrealistic example of movie making at its worst. by the end of the film I didn't care who was lying or if anything was resolved. <br /><br />The most important thing in a film is a good STORY. This story is weak and never develops (just because the subject matter is deep, doesn't mean the story is good). A good story has dynamic characters. A dynamic character is one that experiences a major character change, and is primed for that change over the course of the movie. In Georgia Rule, the character changes were abrupt and undeveloped. Secondly, there were too many ATTEMPTED dynamic characters. Pulling off a really good dynamic character is a tough job and takes time (you've only got a couple hours in a movie). That means that too many attempted dynamic characters will get too little attention to their personal change. Even if I ignore the poorly written story, and the litter of weak dynamic characters, I can't even say I liked anyone. Every character was a mess. That's fine if your're writing American Beauty but not when you're attempting a dramatic comedy. Georgia was a horrible mother, her daughter was a horrible mother and daughter, and Lohan was a horrible excuse for a human being (no I'm not cutting her any slack because she was molested, crap happens to everyone and we're all responsible for our own actions). The \"Dudley Do Right\" Mormon kid should have had the guts not to compromise his religion and commitments...and Simon, I mean seriously, what kind of guy lets a 17 year old girl who's been molested just stay over occasionally (unless he's an actor or a politician).

{"value":"Thanks for killing the franchise with this turkey, John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace. This movie sucks on so many levels it's pathetic. The first VAMPIRES was fun, but this low budget retread makes me yawn.<br /><br />Jon Bon Jovi (the poor man's Kevin Bacon) drives around Mexico with a surfboard housing a hidden compartment holding his vampire killing gear ala Antonio Banderas's guitar case in DESPERADO. He picks up some lame \"hunters\" along the way (including an annoyingly feminist infected girl who takes pills to keep from turning into a vampire), and they set out to stop some female master vampire who is given no backstory and so we could care less about her or her quest (to walk in the sunlight by stealing the Black Cross and performing a ritual to allow her to do so). If you've seen the first VAMPIRES, you've already seen this, and done much better.<br /><br />John Carpenter has been responsible for a lot of bad movies lately. Frankly, I think he's past his prime and incapable of making another horror classic. The only decent film he's done since THEY LIVE (1987) is VAMPIRES. Everything else is complete crap, right up until the unbelievably cheap looking and retarded GHOSTS OF MARS... and now this waste of celluloid. Where are more greats like ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, HALLOWEEN (1), ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING?<br /><br />Carpenter crony Wallace proves he can't write his way out of a paper bag with his paper-thin script packed with yawns, groans and recycled gags from the original. Did I mention I hated every character in the movie? There was not a single memorable character in the whole film. How does that happen? This film has nothing to recommend it. Not even the DVD presentation is good; the menu looks awful.<br /><br />By comparison, JASON X: \"FRIDAY THE 13th IN SPACE\" was a masterpiece. Now that is how you make a sequel and (re)energize a franchise, ladies and germs, as well as create an exciting DVD

When our hero, Gaston, is given the grand show by Dr. Maillard, head of the asylum, we see all kinds of things which are suppose to be horrific, such as men hanging around long in a dungeon, and comedic, such as our hero being joked upon by soldiers as he climbs down a ladder hanging over the side of a building. Then there is one sight which might have been meant to be both: a human man dressed as a chicken, yes, that's right a chicken, that pecks around the ground for chicken feed. The scene was to be a comedic highlight of the film, but, at least for me, it was the film's low point and really most revolting when you considered that grown men and women thought this might even be remotely entertaining. Ah! That is indeed the real horror that is Dr. Tarr and his Legion of Name Changes. And that brings me to this salient fact about the film which is most films that undergo multiple title changes usually have some kind of serious problem. Yes, this is obvious, but some have distribution problems and others, of which this is one, have numerous title changes so that someone might unsuspectingly buy the same garbage more than once. This is definitely garbage. It has very little going for it. The only performer worth having a look at is Claudio Brook as the head of the asylum. He is one huge slab of ham as he laughs maniacally, bellows orders, sashays with sword in hand, and praises the chicken. I got so tired of hearing him talk about the \"soothing system\" as his means to cure the mentally sick. What a bunch of ludicrosity(Hey, a film like this with a script like this deserves this kind of word). It won't take you long to figure out what is going on in the asylum nor will it be any more interesting.

{"value":"I rented this movie because it sounded pretty interesting but to my Horror this movie was the worst movie I had ever seen! I read the comment from Gumby-8 and he has to be a part of the cast or the crew. Unless Gumby-8 is a 4 year old child or some demented cult member no one in their right mind would think that this movie had any potential at all.<br /><br />I couldn't believe Gumby-8's comments. <br /><br />Quoting: \"From the \"Dune\" inspired opening animation to the quick pace...this film keeps the eye moving and works so well that repeat viewing is not unexpected.\"<br /><br />The Animation is the only aspect of the movie that was interesting and the fact of that the film keeps the eye moving, well that's because you keep looking for any type of suspense. I mean give me a break Halloween was shot with a budget of $100,000.00 and a painted mask and also by the way became a cult classic. As far as \"repeat viewing is not unexpected\" I think he made a typo.<br /><br />Another quote from Gumby-8 the only Fan: \"The acting is also a strong aspect of the film.\"<br /><br />With all due respect for the actors, their performance is nothing more than the respective talent of Robert Napton.<br /><br />The catchy Tagline: \"Beware the hour between dusk and darkness\"<br /><br />That's because there is no dusk or darkness in this movie.<br /><br />MPAA rating \"Rated R for some violence/gore\"<br /><br />The only gore you see is some red paint on a sheet over a dead body you never see. As far as I know it might be a clump of grass.<br /><br />In summation, I have seen horror flicks from the 50's, 60's and 70's. I have seen what I thought to be the absolutely worst and some that were very good. The director of this film either did not make any attempt, was asleep, or took a hit of acid. Whatever the case I think the actors deserve applause for trying to salvage a very poor job of direction. I would give this film a rating of .5 for a 'B' movie.","finished_norm":["i","rent","thi","movi","becaus","it","sound","pretti","interest","but","to","my","horror","thi","movi","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","i","read","the","comment","from","gumbi","and","he","have","to","be","a","part","of","the","cast","or","the","crow","unless","gumbi","be","a","year","old","child","or","some","dement","cult","member","no","on","in","their","right","mind","would","think","that","thi","movi","have","ani","potenti","at","allbr","br","i","can","not","believ","gumbi","comment","br","br","quot","from","the","dune","inspir","open","anim","to","the","quick","pacethi","film","keep","the","ey","move","and","work","so","good","that","repeat","view","be","not","unexpectedbr","br","the","anim","be","the","onli","aspect","of","the","movi","that","be","interest","and","the","fact","of","that","the","film","keep","the","ey","move","good","that","becaus","you","keep","look","for","ani","typ","of","suspens","i","mean","give","me","a","break","halloween","be","shoot","with","a","budget","of","and","a","paint","mask","and","conjur","by","the","wai","becom","a","cult","classic","a","far","a","repeat","view","be","not","unexpect","i","think","he","make","a","typobr","br","anoth","quot","from","gumbi","the","onli","fan","the","act","be","conjur","a","strong","aspect","of","the","filmbr","br","with","all","due","respect","for","the","actor","their","perform","be","noth","much","than","the","respect","talent","of","robert","naptonbr","br","the","catchi","taglin","bewar","the","hour","between","dusk","and","darknessbr","br","that","becaus","there","be","no","dusk","or","dark","in","thi","moviebr","br","mpaa","rate","rate","r","for","some","violencegorebr","br","the","onli","gore","you","see","be","some","red","paint","on","a","sheet","over","a","dead","bodi","you","never","see","a","far","a","i","know","it","mai","be","a","clump","of","grassbr","br","in","summat","i","have","see","horror","flick","from","the","and","i","have","see","what","i","think","to","be","the","absolut","wrong","and","some","that","be","veri","good","the","director","of","thi","film","either","do","not","make","ani","attempt","be","asleep","or","take","a","hit","of","acid","whatev","the","case","i","think","the","actor","deserv","applaus","for","try","to","salvag","a","veri","poor","job","of","direct","i","would","give","thi","film","a","rate","of","for","a","b","movi"],"filtered":["rent","thi","movi","becaus","sound","pretti","interest","horror","thi","movi","wrong","movi","ever","see","read","comment","gumbi","part","cast","crow","unless","gumbi","year","old","child","dement","cult","member","right","mind","think","thi","movi","ani","potenti","allbr","br","believ","gumbi","comment","br","br","quot","dune","inspir","open","anim","quick","pacethi","film","keep","ey","move","work","good","repeat","view","unexpectedbr","br","anim","onli","aspect","movi","interest","fact","film","keep","ey","move","good","becaus","keep","look","ani","typ","suspens","mean","give","break","halloween","shoot","budget","paint","mask","conjur","wai","becom","cult","classic","far","repeat","view","unexpect","think","make","typobr","br","anoth","quot","gumbi","onli","fan","act","conjur","strong","aspect","filmbr","br","due","respect","actor","perform","noth","much","respect","talent","robert","naptonbr","br","catchi","taglin","bewar","hour","dusk","darknessbr","br","becaus","dusk","dark","thi","moviebr","br","mpaa","rate","rate","r","violencegorebr","br","onli","gore","see","red","paint","sheet","dead","bodi","never","see","far","know","mai","clump","grassbr","br","summat","see","horror","flick","see","think","absolut","wrong","veri","good","director","thi","film","either","make","ani","attempt","asleep","take","hit","acid","whatev","case","think","actor","deserv","applaus","try","salvag","veri","poor","job","direct","give","thi","film","rate","b","movi"],"filtered2":["rent","becaus","sound","pretti","interest","horror","wrong","ever","see","read","comment","gumbi","part","cast","crow","unless","gumbi","year","old","child","dement","cult","member","right","mind","think","ani","potenti","allbr","believ","gumbi","comment","quot","dune","inspir","open","anim","quick","pacethi","keep","ey","move","work","good","repeat","view","unexpectedbr","anim","onli","aspect","interest","fact","keep","ey","move","good","becaus","keep","look","ani","typ","suspens","mean","give","break","halloween","shoot","budget","paint","mask","conjur","wai","becom","cult","classic","far","repeat","view","unexpect","think","make","typobr","anoth","quot","gumbi","onli","fan","act","conjur","strong","aspect","filmbr","due","respect","actor","perform","noth","respect","talent","robert","naptonbr","catchi","taglin","bewar","hour","dusk","darknessbr","becaus","dusk","dark","moviebr","mpaa","rate","rate","r","violencegorebr","onli","gore","see","red","paint","sheet","dead","bodi","never","see","far","know","mai","clump","grassbr","summat","see","horror","flick","se

{"value":"My comments on this movie have been deleted twice, which i find pretty offending, since i am making an effort to judge this movie for other people. Please be tolerant of other people's opinion. Obviously writing in the spirit of Nietzsches works is not understood, so ill change my comment completely.<br /><br />I think this is a really bad movie for several reasons.<br /><br />Subject: one should be very careful in making a movie about a philosopher that is even today not understood by the masses and amongst peers brings out passionate discussions. One thing philosophers do agree on is that Nietzsche was a great thinker. So making a movie about his life, which obviously includes his 'ideas' is a thing one should be extremely careful with, or preferably, don't do at all. Wisdom starts with knowing what you don't know. One might think this is not a review of the movie itself, but the movie is not about an imaginary character, it is about the life of someone who actually lived and had/has great influence on the world of yesterday, today and tomorrow. If someone tells a story about a tomato, i can express my thoughts about the story itself, but also about the chosen subject, the tomato. There is a responsibility for producers when they make a movie about actual facts. Specially in a case like this and this responsibility was not taken.<br /><br />Screenplay: One of the first things i noticed were the ridiculous accents. Why? It distracts from what it should be about; Nietzsche and the truths he found. It doesn't help putting things in a right geographical perspective or time! Come on, make it proper English or better yet; German! Even Mel Gibson got that part right... letting his characters speak some gibberish Aramaic in the Passion.<br /><br />Secondly, it is well over-acted.<br /><br />3d, Assante is not an actor to depict Nietzsche.

{"value":"Before I comment on this movie I just watched on YouTube, I have to admit that the reason I checked this out was to rewatch something I first saw on the TV ads in 1980: Barbara Bach's cleavage. And since the movie received an R rating, I expected to see her nude. Alas, no dice for her or of the other gorgeous actress that appeared here: Stacey Nelkin who's supposed to be a teen but was actually 20 when she made this. Seeing her in a bra and panty and later in a belly dancer outfit was just as arousing as Ms. Bach. They provide some of the scattered laughs this movie provides. In fact, I don't blame Ron Leibman for having his name removed from the credits since his role as the tight-fisted Liceman is pretty embarrassing though I did like the \"seduction\" scene he did with Ms. Nelkin. This also happens to be the debut of Ralph Macchio who's the loner among the misfits sent to an academy school. The others are a black kid who really loves his stepmother and Ms. Bach, an Arab who worships motor oil, and a politician's son who loves his girlfriend Candy (Nelkin's character) so much, he risks sneaking in the middle of the night see her in the girls academy. Among the supporting cast, Tom Poston plays a swishy character named Sisson who I found partly amusing. With a screenplay by Tom Patchett and Jay Tarses and direction by Robert Downey Sr. (whose son Robert Downey Jr. has a cameo early on in a soccer scene), Up the Academy is uneven with the politically incorrect humor but unless you're really offended at the scatological and sexual content, this is actually a pretty harmless comedy that Mad Magazine and its trademark cover boy-Alfred E. Newman-shouldn't be ashamed of even though they once had their name and character taken off the picture...P.S. Another one of the \"misfits\" was Harry Teinowitz who was born in my birth town of Chicago, Ill. He played Rodney Ververgaert.

{"value":"Wow. I have seen some really bad movies in my time, but this one truly takes the cake. It's the worst movie I've seen in the past decade - no exaggeration.<br /><br />As a US Army veteran of the war in Afghanistan, I found it nearly impossible to even finish watching this ridiculous film, not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt at \"authenticity\" to be found anywhere in the film. Not so much as the tiniest little shred. It seemed like it had been written by an 8 year-old child who got all his notions of war (and soldierly behavior) straight out of comic books. The film was made in Honduras, which should have been a clue, but even that can't fully explain the atrocious production values of this cliché-ridden piece of trash.<br /><br />I could try to list all the endless technical flaws, but it would take virtually forever. From the ancient unit shoulder patches which have not been seen or worn since WWII, and the character's name tags, like \"ColCollins\" (worn by the character \"Colonel Collins\"), which was actually spelled using the reversed, mirror-image \"N\" of the Russian alphabet (not the US alphabet) the list just goes on and on. The uniforms, the equipment, the plot, and most especially the behavior of the characters themselves -- every single scene was just chock-full of ridiculous flaws, inaccuracies and utterly mindless clichés.<br /><br />Neither the storyline itself nor the characters were the least bit credible or believable. It was all laughably childish, in the extreme. This was obviously a movie that was meant to appeal strictly to pre-pubescent boys, and I have little doubt that even they would find this film utterly absurd.<br /><br />In short, this film has absolutely NO redeeming qualities at all.

{"value":"I honestly had somewhat high expectations when I first began to watch this movie, but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films I have ever seen!<br /><br />First of all, the pace is incredibly slow, so it seems much longer than it is (and it's not short).I'm sure when Jane Austen wrote the book, she made it several pages long, filled it with description, and didn't intend for people to read in in one day, or it might drag and lose it's appeal, which \"Emma\" most certainly did. Now \"Sense and Sensibility\" had this flaw of a slow pace, but at least it had lively lines to make up for it, as well as some good performances!<br /><br />That brings me to flaw #2, which is of course, the acting. While I don't happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film, I am sure they are capable of good work, but I didn't see much of it in this movie. It was like people were trying too hard to be witty, too hard to be \"upper-class\", too hard to be British (well, some of them), so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people.<br /><br />#3. The cast, as I said, seemed only like actors, and not actually like the people they were playing. Maybe that's a good thing, because the people they played really weren't all that nice. Why did everybody like Emma, for example? Sure, she was nice to the rich, handsome people in front of them, but she was an awful gossip behind their backs. If her friends were \"ugly\", then she didn't even bother to go behind their backs. So, why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, \"just to make her laugh?\" Of course the snob couldn't even do that right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her \"Emma\" did not exactly change my opinion.<br /><br />Well, it's easy to see that I did not care for this one. I'm sure it's a lovely book and all, but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen, and \"Emma\" is one of them.","finished_norm":["i","honestli","have","somewhat","high","expect","when","i","begin","to","watch","thi","movi","but","it","turn","out","to","be","probabl","on","of","the","much","bore","film","i","have","ever","seenbr","br","of","all","the","pace","be","incredibli","slow","so","it","seem","much","long","than","it","be","and","it","not","shortim","sure","when","jane","austen","write","the","book","she","make","it","sever","page","long","fill","it","with","descript","and","do","not","intend","for","peopl","to","read","in","in","on","dai","or","it","mai","drag","and","lose","it","appeal","which","emma","much","certainli","do","now","sens","and","sensibl","have","thi","flaw","of","a","slow","pace","but","at","littl","it","have","live","line","to","make","up","for","it","a","good","a","some","good","performancesbr","br","that","bring","me","to","flaw","which","be","of","cours","the","act","while","i","do","not","happen","to","care","for","basic","anybodi","involv","in","thi","film","i","be","sure","thei","be","capabl","of","good","work","but","i","do","not","see","much","of","it","in","thi","movi","it","be","like","peopl","be","try","too","hard","to","be","witti","too","hard","to","be","upperclass","too","hard","to","be","british","good","some","of","them","so","thei","all","just","come","off","a","a","bunch","of","actor","and","not","a","peoplebr","br","the","cast","a","i","sai","seem","onli","like","actor","and","not","actual","like","the","peopl","thei","be","plai","mayb","that","a","good","thing","becaus","the","peopl","thei","plai","realli","be","not","all","that","nice","why","do","everybodi","like","emma","for","exampl","sure","she","be","nice","to","the","rich","handsom","peopl","in","front","of","them","but","she","be","a","aw","gossip","behind","their","back","if","her","friend","be","ugli","then","she","do","not","even","bother","to","go","behind","their","back","so","why","be","thi","girl","so","great","why","do","peopl","have","to","tell","stori","just","to","make","her","laugh","of","cours","the","snob","can","not","even","do","that","right","i","have","enough","problem","with","gwyneth","paltrow","a","gwyneth","paltrow","and","her","emma","do","not","exactli","chang","my","opinionbr","br","good","it","easi","to","see","that","i","do","not","care","for","thi","on","i","be","sure","it","a","love","book","and","all","but","some","book","be","realli","not","mean","to","be","make","for","the","big","screen","and","emma","be","on","of","them"],"filtered":["honestli","somewhat","high","expect","begin","watch","thi","movi","turn","probabl","much","bore","film","ever","seenbr","br","pace","incredibli","slow","seem","much","long","shortim","sure","jane","austen","write","book","make","sever","page","long","fill","descript","intend","peopl","read","dai","mai","drag","lose","appeal","emma","much","certainli","sens","sensibl","thi","flaw","slow","pace","littl","live","line","make","good","good","performancesbr","br","bring","flaw","cours","act","happen","care","basic","anybodi","involv","thi","film","sure","thei","capabl","good","work","see","much","thi","movi","like","peopl","try","hard","witti","hard","upperclass","hard","british","good","thei","come","bunch","actor","peoplebr","br","cast","sai","seem","onli","like","actor","actual","like","peopl","thei","plai","mayb","good","thing","becaus","peopl","thei","plai","realli","nice","everybodi","like","emma","exampl","sure","nice","rich","handsom","peopl","front","aw","gossip","behind","back","friend","ugli","even","bother","go","behind","back","thi","girl","great","peopl","tell","stori","make","laugh","cours","snob","even","right","enough","problem","gwyneth","paltrow","gwyneth","paltrow","emma","exactli","chang","opinionbr","br","good","easi","see","care","thi","sure","love","book","book","realli","mean","make","big","screen","emma"],"filtered2":["honestli","somewhat","high","expect","begin","watch","turn","probabl","bore","ever","seenbr","pace","incredibli","slow","seem","long","shortim","sure","jane","austen","write","book","make","sever","page","long","fill","descript","intend","peopl","read","dai","mai","drag","lose","appeal","emma","certainli","sens","sensibl","flaw","slow","pace","littl","live","line","make","good","good","performancesbr","bring","flaw","cours","act","happen","care","basic","anybodi","involv","sure","capabl","good","work","see","like","peopl","try","hard","witti","hard","upperclass","hard","british","good","come","bunch","actor","peoplebr","cast","seem","onli","like","actor","actual","like","peopl","plai","mayb","good","thing","becaus","peopl","plai","realli","nice","everybodi","like","emma","exampl","sure","nice","rich","handsom","peopl","front","aw","gossip","behind","back","friend","ugli","even","bother","go","behind","back","girl","great","peopl","tell","stori","make","laugh","cours","snob","even","right","enough","problem","gwyneth","paltrow","gwyneth","paltrow","emma","exactli","chang","opinionbr","good","easi","see","care",

{"value":"Pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion/philosophy. The two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about Quantum Physics in this mess is just plain wrong.<br /><br />Examples? Quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion. How? Well, in the world of the subatomic, you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time. You can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time. Also, the act of observation seems to affect the event. Solid particles can pass through barriers. All of this, so far, is accurate. But then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall, you could indeed do it. This is complete poppycock. Instead, the theory asserts that at our level, it is possible for you to walk through a wall, but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief. Also you'd have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall, the odds are so astronomically against it.<br /><br />This is but one example of how they misrepresent the science. But much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer, played by Marlee Maitlan. About halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible. Something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self-hate. There may be some truth to that, but Quantum physics has nothing to do with it.<br /><br />Plus, string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays. Instead of wasting your time with this dreck, I suggest you rent The Elegant Universe, an amazing series done for NOVA on PBS that gives you a history of physics from Newton and gravity to Ed Witten and M Theory in only 3 hour-long episodes. Quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation.","finished_norm":["pathet","attempt","to","us","scienc","to","justifi","new","ag","religionphilosophi","the","two","have","noth","to","do","with","each","other","and","much","of","what","be","sai","about","quantum","physic","in","thi","mess","be","just","plain","wrongbr","br","exampl","quantum","theori","support","the","idea","in","eastern","religion","that","realiti","be","a","illus","how","good","in","the","world","of","the","subatom","you","can","never","definit","predict","a","particl","locat","at","a","specif","time","you","can","onli","give","the","odd","of","it","be","precis","at","on","spot","at","on","time","conjur","the","act","of","observ","seem","to","affect","the","event","solid","particl","can","pass","through","barrier","all","of","thi","so","far","be","accur","but","then","thei","assert","that","that","mean","that","if","you","believ","sincer","enough","that","you","can","walk","through","a","wall","you","can","ind","do","it","thi","be","complet","poppycock","instead","the","theori","assert","that","at","our","level","it","be","possibl","for","you","to","walk","through","a","wall","but","it","be","mere","by","chanc","and","have","noth","to","do","with","belief","conjur","you","have","have","to","keep","walk","into","the","wall","for","etern","to","ever","have","even","the","remot","chanc","of","pass","through","the","wall","the","odd","be","so","astronom","against","itbr","br","thi","be","but","on","exampl","of","how","thei","misrepres","the","scienc","but","much","much","annoi","be","the","narr","involv","a","unhappi","photograph","plai","by","marle","maitlan","about","halfwai","through","the","pictur","it","becom","so","confus","a","to","be","incomprehens","someth","to","do","with","neg","thought","lead","to","addict","and","selfhat","there","mai","be","some","truth","to","that","but","quantum","physic","have","noth","to","do","with","itbr","br","plu","string","theori","be","the","hot","new","thing","in","physic","nowadai","instead","of","wast","your","time","with","thi","dreck","i","suggest","you","rend","the","eleg","univers","a","amaz","seri","do","for","nova","on","pb","that","give","you","a","histori","of","physic","from","newton","and","graviti","to","ed","witten","and","be","theori","in","onli","hourlong","episod","quantum","mechan","be","explain","there","quit","good","if","you","want","to","know","it","without","the","fog","of","metaphys","appropri"],"filtered":["pathet","attempt","us","scienc","justifi","new","ag","religionphilosophi","two","noth","much","sai","quantum","physic","thi","mess","plain","wrongbr","br","exampl","quantum","theori","support","idea","eastern","religion","realiti","illus","good","world","subatom","never","definit","predict","particl","locat","specif","time","onli","give","odd","precis","spot","time","conjur","act","observ","seem","affect","event","solid","particl","pass","barrier","thi","far","accur","thei","assert","mean","believ","sincer","enough","walk","wall","ind","thi","complet","poppycock","instead","theori","assert","level","possibl","walk","wall","mere","chanc","noth","belief","conjur","keep","walk","wall","etern","ever","even","remot","chanc","pass","wall","odd","astronom","itbr","br","thi","exampl","thei","misrepres","scienc","much","much","annoi","narr","involv","unhappi","photograph","plai","marle","maitlan","halfwai","pictur","becom","confus","incomprehens","someth","neg","thought","lead","addict","selfhat","mai","truth","quantum","physic","noth","itbr","br","plu","string","theori","hot","new","thing","physic","nowadai","instead","wast","time","thi","dreck","suggest","rend","eleg","univers","amaz","seri","nova","pb","give","histori","physic","newton","graviti","ed","witten","theori","onli","hourlong","episod","quantum","mechan","explain","quit","good","want","know","without","fog","metaphys","appropri"],"filtered2":["pathet","attempt","us","scienc","justifi","new","ag","religionphilosophi","two","noth","quantum","physic","mess","plain","wrongbr","exampl","quantum","theori","support","idea","eastern","religion","realiti","illus","good","world","subatom","never","definit","predict","particl","locat","specif","time","onli","give","odd","precis","spot","time","conjur","act","observ","seem","affect","event","solid","particl","pass","barrier","far","accur","assert","mean","believ","sincer","enough","walk","wall","ind","complet","poppycock","instead","theori","assert","level","possibl","walk","wall","mere","chanc","noth","belief","conjur","keep","walk","wall","etern","ever","even","remot","chanc","pass","wall","odd","astronom","itbr","exampl","misrepres","scienc","annoi","narr","involv","unhappi","photograph","plai","marle","maitlan","halfwai","pictur","becom","confus","incomprehens","someth","neg","thought","lead","addict","selfhat","mai","truth","quantum","physic","noth","itbr","plu","string","theori","hot","new","thing","physic","nowadai","instead","wast","time","dreck","suggest","rend","eleg","univers","amaz","nova","pb","give","

{"value":"All of the X-Men movies were great. And I mean all of them, including the long hated X-Men 3. They had solid characters (Magneto and Xavier were the best ones, in my opinion), and a good story arch.<br /><br />I was all excited when I heard this movie was on production, and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until I saw the movie. I was so disappointed.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is The Fountain, although you won't hear about this movie when they talk about the actor), and his acting is not what screws the movie up.<br /><br />The whole film is plagued with lots of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot (like Blob or Gambit), which were tossed there to make fans believe that the film makers had read the original comics.<br /><br />I am a fan of XMen, I have read many, many of their stories and this movie respected none of them. None. Not even the continuity. It doesn't respect Weapon X project, or the relationship between Wolverine and Sabretooth, or Emma Frost, the motivations for wolverine are plain stupid and seen in millions of movies: Revenge for the death of a loved one.<br /><br />Oh. What I was expecting the whole darn movie was a Berseker moment for Wolverine similar to the one he has in X2 in the school when Stryker men come in and he alone decimates the enemy forces, but hey, this is Fox, this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome Marvel hero.<br /><br />Besides, I had a feeling of constant dejá vù with this movie because Wolverine's Origins are already explained in X2, we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something we already know.<br /><br />I personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid back-story because mystery is the nature of the character. Do we really want to know how the Joker got his scars?","finished_norm":["all","of","the","xmen","movi","be","great","and","i","mean","all","of","them","includ","the","long","hate","xmen","thei","have","solid","charact","magneto","and","xavier","be","the","well","on","in","my","opinion","and","a","good","stori","archbr","br","i","be","all","excit","when","i","hear","thi","movi","be","on","product","and","my","expect","grow","big","and","big","until","i","see","the","movi","i","be","so","disappointedbr","br","hugh","jackman","be","not","a","bad","actor","hi","well","movi","be","the","fountain","although","you","wo","not","hear","about","thi","movi","when","thei","talk","about","the","actor","and","hi","act","be","not","what","screw","the","movi","upbr","br","the","whole","film","be","plagu","with","lot","of","meaningless","charact","that","add","noth","to","the","plot","like","blob","or","gambit","which","be","toss","there","to","make","fan","believ","that","the","film","maker","have","read","the","origin","comicsbr","br","i","be","a","fan","of","xmen","i","have","read","mani","mani","of","their","stori","and","thi","movi","respect","none","of","them","none","not","even","the","continu","it","doe","not","respect","weapon","x","project","or","the","relationship","between","wolverin","and","sabretooth","or","emma","frost","the","motiv","for","wolverin","be","plain","stupid","and","see","in","million","of","movi","reveng","for","the","death","of","a","love","onebr","br","oh","what","i","be","expect","the","whole","darn","movi","be","a","bersek","moment","for","wolverin","similar","to","the","on","he","have","in","x","in","the","school","when","stryker","man","come","in","and","he","alon","decim","the","enemi","forc","but","hei","thi","be","fox","thi","a","famili","flick","and","you","will","not","see","explicit","violenc","from","the","much","violent","and","gruesom","marvel","herobr","br","besid","i","have","a","feel","of","constant","dejá","vù","with","thi","movi","becaus","wolverin","origin","be","alreadi","explain","in","x","we","alreadi","know","how","he","get","hi","adamantium","skeleton","so","it","kind","of","doe","not","make","sens","to","make","a","movi","of","someth","we","alreadi","knowbr","br","i","person","believ","that","wolverin","be","on","of","that","few","charact","that","doe","not","ne","a","solid","backstori","becaus","mysteri","be","the","natur","of","the","charact","do","we","realli","want","to","know","how","the","joker","get","hi","scar"],"filtered":["xmen","movi","great","mean","includ","long","hate","xmen","thei","solid","charact","magneto","xavier","well","opinion","good","stori","archbr","br","excit","hear","thi","movi","product","expect","grow","big","big","see","movi","disappointedbr","br","hugh","jackman","bad","actor","hi","well","movi","fountain","although","wo","hear","thi","movi","thei","talk","actor","hi","act","screw","movi","upbr","br","whole","film","plagu","lot","meaningless","charact","add","noth","plot","like","blob","gambit","toss","make","fan","believ","film","maker","read","origin","comicsbr","br","fan","xmen","read","mani","mani","stori","thi","movi","respect","none","none","even","continu","doe","respect","weapon","x","project","relationship","wolverin","sabretooth","emma","frost","motiv","wolverin","plain","stupid","see","million","movi","reveng","death","love","onebr","br","oh","expect","whole","darn","movi","bersek","moment","wolverin","similar","x","school","stryker","man","come","alon","decim","enemi","forc","hei","thi","fox","thi","famili","flick","see","explicit","violenc","much","violent","gruesom","marvel","herobr","br","besid","feel","constant","dejá","vù","thi","movi","becaus","wolverin","origin","alreadi","explain","x","alreadi","know","get","hi","adamantium","skeleton","kind","doe","make","sens","make","movi","someth","alreadi","knowbr","br","person","believ","wolverin","charact","doe","ne","solid","backstori","becaus","mysteri","natur","charact","realli","want","know","joker","get","hi","scar"],"filtered2":["xmen","great","mean","includ","long","hate","xmen","solid","charact","magneto","xavier","well","opinion","good","stori","archbr","excit","hear","product","expect","grow","big","big","see","disappointedbr","hugh","jackman","bad","actor","well","fountain","although","wo","hear","talk","actor","act","screw","upbr","whole","plagu","lot","meaningless","charact","add","noth","plot","like","blob","gambit","toss","make","fan","believ","maker","read","origin","comicsbr","fan","xmen","read","mani","mani","stori","respect","none","none","even","continu","doe","respect","weapon","x","project","relationship","wolverin","sabretooth","emma","frost","motiv","wolverin","plain","stupid","see","million","reveng","death","love","onebr","oh","expect","whole","darn","bersek","moment","wolverin","similar","x","school","stryker","man","come","alon","decim","enemi","forc","hei","fox","famili","flick","see","explicit","violenc","violent","gruesom","marvel","herobr","besid","feel","constant","dejá","vù","becaus","wolver

{"value":"Many King fans hate this because it departed from the book, but film is a different medium and books should change when they make the jump. That notwithstanding, the movie does fail completely, but it fails entirely on film terms. I'd like to smack the people who tell me it's the scariest movie ever made. I always follow up with the question \"Really... exactly what scene scared you?\" Every fan I've asked, goes silent. Occasionally someone, at a loss for a decent scare (There are none...), names the \"Grape-juice-shooting-out-of-elevators\" shtick. If you're afraid of that, I don't know what to tell you, except maybe that you're easily scared. I just rolled my eyes watching these z-grade horror ideas play out in this schlocky, incoherent movie.<br /><br />One place it diverts from the book and really is insipid is the tedious work the movie does to get Mr Halloran up to the Overlook only to kill him; with the dumbest member of the audience knowing that Jack is waiting behind one of the columns in the corridor that it takes Halloran FOREVER to walk down. Really one of the stupidest sequences ever put on film. <br /><br />Oh, and nice choice for Mr. Halloran's artwork Stanley! Black light afro-nymphomaniacs really add to the mood and character development of a horror movie. Has there ever been a more \"off,\" out-of-place shot in any movie ever made?<br /><br />I consider it a miracle that I was eventually able to bypass this turd, and agree that Kubricks 2001 is a truly important film, given the immense 'bad will' generated by both this stupid, stupid movie, and the cult of fawning but inarticulate Kubrick fan-boys, who couldn't describe an idea at work in it with

{"value":"Although I am generally a proponent of the well-made film, I do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries, and more often than not I do enjoy and admire films that successfully \"break the rules.\" And it is quite true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema. But it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point.<br /><br />Pasolini's work is visually jarring, but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed, and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography. This is true of DECAMERON. Pasolini often preferred to use non-actors, and while many directors have done so with remarkable result, under Pasolini's direction his non-actors tend to remain non-actors. This is also true of DECAMERON. Pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock, offend, or otherwise disconcert the audience. Such elements can often be used with startling effect, but in Pasolini's hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film. This is also true of DECAMERON.<br /><br />I have been given to understand there are many people who like, even admire Pasolini's films. Even so, I have never actually met any of them, and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me. Judging him from his works alone, I am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not \"break the rules\" so much by choice as by lack of skill--and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for \" existential boldness,\" thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker. I find his work tedious, unimpressive, and pretentious. And this, too, is true of DECAMERON. It is also, sadly, true of virtually every Pasolini film it has been my misfortune to
