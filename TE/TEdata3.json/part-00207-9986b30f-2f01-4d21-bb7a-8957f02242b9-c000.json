{"value":"This is one of the worst movies i have ever seen it's EXTREMELY boring with lots of boring dialog and has some VERY annoying characters and a laughable looking creature. The only reason i watched this piece of garbage is because it was on that 8 disc horror set i got. The plot is preposterous and totally stupid as is the finale. No blood what so ever except a few bloody marks on the creature, and a couple of bloody gunshot wounds. The acting is TERRIBLE!!. Richard Cardella is terrible as the sheriff and was quite laughable plus his character is annoying. Glen Roberts is the comic relief and was not funny at all!. Mark Siegel is extremely annoying and was also NOT FUNNY!. Bob Hyman is decent but not much more then that. Richard Garrison is annoying and had no chemistry with Kacey Cobb what so ever. Kacey Cobb is so so here and had no chemistry with Richard. Overall Avoid this piece of garbage at all costs! BOMB out of 5.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","it","extrem","bore","with","lot","of","bore","dialog","and","have","some","veri","annoi","charact","and","a","laughabl","look","creatur","the","onli","reason","i","watch","thi","piec","of","garbag","be","becaus","it","be","on","that","disc","horror","set","i","get","the","plot","be","preposter","and","total","stupid","a","be","the","final","no","blood","what","so","ever","except","a","few","bloodi","mark","on","the","creatur","and","a","coupl","of","bloodi","gunshot","wound","the","act","be","terribl","richard","cardella","be","terribl","a","the","sheriff","and","be","quit","laughabl","plu","hi","charact","be","annoi","glen","robert","be","the","comic","relief","and","be","not","funni","at","all","mark","siegel","be","extrem","annoi","and","be","conjur","not","funni","bob","hyman","be","decent","but","not","much","much","then","that","richard","garrison","be","annoi","and","have","no","chemistri","with","kacei","cobb","what","so","ever","kacei","cobb","be","so","so","here","and","have","no","chemistri","with","richard","overal","avoid","thi","piec","of","garbag","at","all","cost","bomb","out","of"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","movi","ever","see","extrem","bore","lot","bore","dialog","veri","annoi","charact","laughabl","look","creatur","onli","reason","watch","thi","piec","garbag","becaus","disc","horror","set","get","plot","preposter","total","stupid","final","blood","ever","except","bloodi","mark","creatur","coupl","bloodi","gunshot","wound","act","terribl","richard","cardella","terribl","sheriff","quit","laughabl","plu","hi","charact","annoi","glen","robert","comic","relief","funni","mark","siegel","extrem","annoi","conjur","funni","bob","hyman","decent","much","much","richard","garrison","annoi","chemistri","kacei","cobb","ever","kacei","cobb","chemistri","richard","overal","avoid","thi","piec","garbag","cost","bomb"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","see","extrem","bore","lot","bore","dialog","veri","annoi","charact","laughabl","look","creatur","onli","reason","watch","piec","garbag","becaus","disc","horror","set","get","plot","preposter","total","stupid","final","blood","ever","except","bloodi","mark","creatur","coupl","bloodi","gunshot","wound","act","terribl","richard","cardella","terribl","sheriff","quit","laughabl","plu","charact","annoi","glen","robert","comic","relief","funni","mark","siegel","extrem","annoi","conjur","funni","bob","hyman","decent","richard","garrison","annoi","chemistri","kacei","cobb","ever","kacei","cobb","chemistri","richard","overal","avoid","piec","garbag","cost","bomb"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,10,11,15,16,21,22,25,32,39,44,62,72,83,95,108,109,120,136,156,166,184,218,233,253,271,309,329,335,355,412,432,480,539,552,641,702,717,749,761,837,1078,1132,1179,1644,1688,1748,2527,2748,3444,5752,7000],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,10,11,15,16,21,22,25,32,39,44,62,72,83,95,108,109,120,136,156,166,184,218,233,253,271,309,329,335,355,412,432,480,539,552,641,702,717,749,761,837,1078,1132,1179,1644,1688,1748,2527,2748,3444,5752,7000],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,4.814188177507422,4.045224089013853,1.9209463754160525,2.292318797740072,2.0323326556775485,4.277015007255866,2.125691139326857,2.2044500422972613,2.346825985579986,2.3451551414151686,4.884774065938707,2.496249838866882,5.188174963723441,2.6102777977348763,2.7073305177318163,11.03096279382286,2.848772527704847,5.903973581628264,2.908534262247101,3.185521045582134,3.107414446935464,3.235085203598255,3.43462735814388,3.6105180246075443,6.849501469295936,11.110392411350967,7.293333077447711,7.479663562575727,3.7165362186843414,7.881004953500029,3.7881170224473255,4.280272325592784,8.437256324963155,8.549017241752068,4.890269137820559,4.770124825978496,4.751432692966343,5.243909178064138,5.290429193699031,5.719991853386255,6.389041482367141,13.589013180950609]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.5852203971704097E-5,5.547557950314351E-5,5.590684923508903E-5,5.558381886461308E-5,5.558472954290478E-5,5.550703319895518E-5,5.567211889294395E-5,5.5483567624103676E-5,5.5608314910282E-5,6.169438985465303E-5,0.6340318961982341,5.5394004913182916E-5,5.6427906545162526E-5,5.7232863031273355E-5,5.5434397643700904E-5,5.528120088630423E-5,5.66601212913047E-5,5.567733495025344E-5,5.5504596235464385E-5,5.555059967719442E-5,5.6088084310153045E-5,5.573249710017789E-5,5.57959570031045E-5,5.585607088875027E-5,5.628473753693841E-5,5.5990384204986494E-5,5.83441135908679E-5,5.5410473042937984E-5

{"value":"1 is being pretty generous here. I really enjoyed BOOGEYMAN, even though it is not really the BOOGEYMAN promoted on the DVD cover and we all know it! It creeped me out. But this film, it is something else. For being directed by a guy who has been around a long time and directed a lot of movies, it looks like it was shot on a VHS camcorder by a 10 year old! The story and acting are atrocious! David Hess, you have let me down too. After playing one of the most menacing villains in film history, you have resorted to this? The story and acting may have been able to be forgiven however, if anyone had taken the time to make the video look somewhat professional. There are a LOT of shot on video films out there that don't look like it, or at least aren't so obvious that it detracts your attention from the film.

{"value":"Normally I would never rent a movie like this, because you know it's going to be bad just by looking at the box. I rented seven movies at the same time, including Nightmare on Elm Street 5, 6 and Wes Craven's New Nightmare. Unfortunately, when I got home I found out the videostore-guy gave me the wrong tape. In the box of Wes Craven's New Nightmare I found this lame movie.<br /><br />This movie is incredibly boring, the acting is bad and the plot doesn't make any sense. It's hard to write a good review, because I have no idea what the movie was really about. At the end of the movie you have more questions then answers.<br /><br />On 'Max Power's Scale of 1 to 10' I rate this movie: 1<br /><br />PS I would like to correct Corinthian's review (right below mine).

{"value":"I stumbled upon Nine Dead recently and read the current reviews thinking I could deal with an average movie. This movie however was slightly below average, yet watchable. The script was poorly written and the acting was at average for a B-level movie with a couple standing out as pretty good. The plot borders on that of Saw, teach people what they did wrong in a situation and try to make them appreciate life more, but that is really where the comparison ends. Nine dead tries to have heart and purpose behind simple ideas that are not new. The main fault that I found in Nine dead, was the slap in the face to the viewer of flashbacks that occurred 3 minutes before in the film and were completely unnecessary and a completely inadequate ending that people won't see coming, in a bad way. Barring any spoilers I have seen the worse of bad movies and even they didn't end this poorly.

{"value":"This movie is like the thousand \"cat and mouse\" movies that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies) There is the passionate, wise main character, his goofy but well-meaning sidekick with his ill-placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable \"unlikely\" love story, the loved ones taken hostage, and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions. Everybody has seen tons of these movies already, and \"National Treasure\" is like any one of them, with only a slightly modified wrapping. Every turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you I am not the sharpest tool in the shed). I am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a Hollywood movie, and if you have ever felt that way too, heed my warning; stay miles away from this

{"value":"Honestly, my expectations for Little Bush were low. I was expecting a little cartoon series with lots of fun (but rehashed and overdone) Bush jokes. Apparently I should have lowered my expectations even more.<br /><br />The writing was absolutely pathetic. Aside from the Cheney-Chicken-Eating joke, and some giggly-little swipes, it was really boring and unfunny.<br /><br />The animation was about as sophisticated as a thirteen-year old's Flash Project. It's disgraceful that they used Macromedia's product for this, because it's capable of so much more.<br /><br />I don't like Bush that much, and I enjoy a Bush-joke as much as the next guy, but this was just a half-hour swipe at the President with several painfully un-funny moments. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did so much more with That's My Bush.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, skip \"Lil' Bush\" and go buy a copy of the short-lived comedy \"That's My Bush\".

{"value":"Being born in the 1960's I grew up watching the TV \"Movies of the Week\" in the early 70's and loved the creepy movies that were routinely shown including \"Crowhaven Farm\", \"Bad Ronald\", \"Satan's School for Girls\", \"Kolchak the Night Stalker\", etc, but this one is just plain dumb.This is obviously the writer's trying to capitalize on the horrific Manson murders from a few years earlier. The movie stars Dennis Weaver of \"McCloud\" and \"Duel\" fame as a father who takes his family camping on a beach. The family encounters some hippies who for some reason decide to terrorize the family. The reason for this is never explained, and Weaver's pacifistic stance is hard to swallow. For God's sake, call the police, beat the hell of them or something, just don't sit there and whine about it. The acting is pretty lame, the story unbelievable, etc. Susan Dey looks cute in a bikini but that's about it.

{"value":"This movie is one of the most wildly distorted portrayals of history. Horribly inaccurate, this movie does nothing to honor the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built \"over the bodies of the white man\" as stated by the head Japanese engineer. It is disgusting that such unspeakable horrors committed by the Japanese captors is the source of a movie, where the bridge itself, isn't even close to accurate to the actual bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, not wood. What of the survivors who are still alive today? They hate the movie and all that it is supposed to represent. Their friends were starved, tortured, and murdered by cruel sadists.

{"value":"I go to UCSB and take some classes with the executive producer, Alison Anders. She's a superb teacher and director so anything she put her name on, I thought must be pretty good. This film as a selection at the Santa Barbara film festival seemed like a good choice.<br /><br />While this movie included some nice shots and cinematography, the lack of story and coherence really took away from anything the it was attempting to accomplish. My main problem was that this was someone's first film and you could obviously tell. Bad acting and an even worse screenplay stopped this film from getting off the ground. The soundtrack had some nice music that gave a sense of the main characters struggle to cope with the sadness that lead to his leaving and now returning the place he grew up. I just have to say that despite some of the better craft of the film, it's lack of story and performance really prevented it from being some

{"value":"The cast of this film contain some of New Zealander's better actors, many of who I have seen in fabulous roles, this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them. The fake American accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. As another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry, decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot. Most of the cast appear to be from the (great) long running New Zealand soap Shortland Street. It's as if this movie was dreamt up at a Shortland Street cast Christmas party, the result of too many gins, and possibly a bit of salmonella. Imagine \"Under Siege\" meets \"The Love Boat\", staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea.<br /><br />If you are an actor, I recommend you see this film, as

{"value":"I watched the film recently and it poorly resembles the book is based on. I blame this on poor screenplay and direction. Some parts were forcibly introduced (the gay rape scene) for no apparent reason. I actually read the book after watching the movie and some 20 years or so after reading it for the first time. I found it hard to read and somewhat clumsy. Too many disparate ideas introduced for no benefit at all... other than sensational parts for the time. As it covers stuff that was deemed 'sensitive', to say the least, during communism, I can see the fascination it produced at the time. That isn't the case anymore though or maybe I see things differently now or a bit of both. The film tries too much to cover many aspects from the book, the result being a concoction of scenes that may make some sense to someone who read the book.

{"value":"How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget and without being completely retooled is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are beyond amateurish. Characters say things no real person would ever say and almost never react to things that were said before. No one seems to be grounded in the real world. The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a dud...but several actors in supporting roles really drag the production down. The hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention- grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly boring. What a shame! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far better movie around them.

{"value":"The super sexy B movie actress has another bit part as future \"Goodfellas\" star Ray Liotta's girlfriend in this box office bomb. She plays Marion, has only one line of dialog, well, one WORD of dialog actually. She shouts out \"Joe!\" as Ray's character is violating poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This movie is so bad though it becomes funny, hilarious at times. The guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love this! Check out the hysterical scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the cheesy editing and effects they do to try and show how badly Pia's character is freaking out. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this. Pia Zadora as a screenwriter? Yeah, right. Pia can barely talk, let alone write! Pia is utterly and absolutely miscast in this dumb role. But who cares? The real star is the hot and fresh Glory Annen in her bit part in this cat's opinion!

{"value":"I generally LIKE watching Burt Lancaster's films--especially when he is needed to go nuts with his imposing screen presence like in Elmer Gantry. However, his greatest strength, his magnetism, was occasionally also his greatest weakness as he rarely, if ever, underplayed ANYTHING. And it is this lack of subtlety that really hinders The Rainmaker. Now I understand that his character was meant to be a sort of showman but how Katherine Hepburn could fall under his spell is completely inexplicable. She is supposed to be smart but doesn't seem so when Lancaster's blarney is being thrown about the screen! In addition to this, the story is perhaps one of the most stagy looking films I have ever seen and it is way too obvious that this is a movie based on a play. It just looks like it was mostly filmed in a sound stage instead of in the great wide open West like it was supposed to be.<br /><br />Overall, a very overrated film.","finished_norm":["i","gener","like","watch","burt","lancast","filmsespeci","when","he","be","ne","to","go","nut","with","hi","impos","screen","presenc","like","in","elmer","gantri","howev","hi","great","strength","hi","magnet","be","occasion","conjur","hi","great","weak","a","he","rare","if","ever","underplai","anyth","and","it","be","thi","lack","of","subtleti","that","realli","hinder","the","rainmak","now","i","understand","that","hi","charact","be","mean","to","be","a","sort","of","showman","but","how","katherin","hepburn","can","fall","under","hi","spell","be","complet","inexplic","she","be","suppos","to","be","smart","but","doe","not","seem","so","when","lancast","blarnei","be","be","throw","about","the","screen","in","addit","to","thi","the","stori","be","perhap","on","of","the","much","stagi","look","film","i","have","ever","see","and","it","be","wai","too","obviou","that","thi","be","a","movi","base","on","a","plai","it","just","look","like","it","be","mostli","film","in","a","sound","stage","instead","of","in","the","great","wide","open","west","like","it","be","suppos","to","bebr","br","overal","a","veri","overr","film"],"filtered":["gener","like","watch","burt","lancast","filmsespeci","ne","go","nut","hi","impos","screen","presenc","like","elmer","gantri","howev","hi","great","strength","hi","magnet","occasion","conjur","hi","great","weak","rare","ever","underplai","anyth","thi","lack","subtleti","realli","hinder","rainmak","understand","hi","charact","mean","sort","showman","katherin","hepburn","fall","hi","spell","complet","inexplic","suppos","smart","doe","seem","lancast","blarnei","throw","screen","addit","thi","stori","perhap","much","stagi","look","film","ever","see","wai","obviou","thi","movi","base","plai","look","like","mostli","film","sound","stage","instead","great","wide","open","west","like","suppos","bebr","br","overal","veri","overr","film"],"filtered2":["gener","like","watch","burt","lancast","filmsespeci","ne","go","nut","impos","screen","presenc","like","elmer","gantri","howev","great","strength","magnet","occasion","conjur","great","weak","rare","ever","underplai","anyth","lack","subtleti","realli","hinder","rainmak","understand","charact","mean","sort","showman","katherin","hepburn","fall","spell","complet","inexplic","suppos","smart","doe","seem","lancast","blarnei","throw","screen","addit","stori","perhap","stagi","look","ever","see","wai","obviou","base","plai","look","like","mostli","sound","stage","instead","great","wide","open","west","like","suppos","bebr","overal","veri","overr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,10,13,15,16,17,18,33,35,39,40,44,51,88,103,104,110,113,149,152,170,178,183,192,212,225,242,269,310,318,334,379,383,412,510,669,1013,1090,1099,1119,1159,1185,1582,1783,1872,2111,2116,2221,2361,3131,3430,3655,4906,5918,5992,7614],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,10,13,15,16,17,18,33,35,39,40,44,51,88,103,104,110,113,149,152,170,178,183,192,212,225,242,269,310,318,334,379,383,412,510,669,1013,1090,1099,1119,1159,1185,1582,1783,1872,2111,2116,2221,2361,3131,3430,3655,4906,5918,5992,7614],"values":[2.5841531782306313,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,3.209458785004948,5.141969792492947,2.0317223413467334,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.1290479736304078,2.1521782565202803,4.650639560718045,2.3131195476980753,2.4071371113909277,2.532833256045391,2.4885128563647294,5.063653426867979,2.5983793339432615,2.641219492619754,2.689504733779216,2.76533567167316,2.854312708080462,2.902686292364678,2.942840385588056,3.1272886331425473,3.0433232530252132,3.107414446935464,3.374440724508766,3.7099788181381825,4.039936373738201,4.339813719283801,4.135246553542527,4.235066888824737,4.224077767249142,4.235066888824737,4.621379564718146,4.838444069955973,4.789173020949191,4.9909126636002465,5.039114765418124,5.02684467282631,5.339219357868463,5.482320201509136,5.604922523601468,6.2980697041614135,6.137727054086234,6.389041482367141,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.249730860425139E-5,6.207587464165488E-5,6.255845537459654E-5,6.219699195298458E-5,6.219801098067174E-5,6.211107059085829E-5,6.229579761736185E-5,6.208481316198737E-5,6.222440245457428E-5,0.15445714673480432,0.6555463912206607,6.198459458535459E-5,6.314150630531115E-5,6.404223376722024E-5,6.202979310510916E-5,6.185836952030235E-5,6.340134916951501E-5,6.230163426337019E-5,6.21083436857675E-5,6.215982046000754E-5,6.276125318042582E-5,6.236335941765146E-5,6.243436956327094E-5,6.

{"value":"This one is a real bomb. We are supposed to believe that Merle Oberon is the sequestered daughter of an ambitious politician who must prove to the Tom DeLay of the 1930s that he is worth supporting as a presidential candidate. Poor Merle can't go anywhere, but is surrounded by politicians and their quacking, quaking wives and supported only by kindly uncle Harry Davenport. She joins her two maids on a blind date and Gary Cooper happens to show up. Some shots of rodeo might have enlivened things, a la \"Misfits,\" but no such luck with this one. Gary later breaks in to a formal dinner, at which Merle is presiding, and, though invited to sit down and join the group, reads them a lecture on their snobbery. Where did this diffident cowboy's sudden eloquence come from? The most excruciating scene in the film is a phantom party that Gary holds in his unfinished house for his absent wife, Merle. Will it never end?

{"value":"Doris Day never lets a bad script get her down. Even in the most trying of circumstances, Day gives 100% and usually comes out unscathed. This comedy, perhaps inspired by a real-life New York City black-out in 1965 but actually adapted from a late-'50s French play by Claude Magnier, gives Doris little to do but spoof her own goody-goody image and, in the second-half, be comically sedated (which is amusing because of the spin Day gives to the situation). There are some funny lines here, yet the staginess of the material has obviously been carried over from the play...and instead of conjuring up some amusing incidents within the Big Apple, we get stuck in the suburbs. Doris' co-stars (Patrick O'Neal, Robert Morse, and Terry-Thomas) are not well-suited to her, and neither is the shapeless hairdo they've got her wearing.

{"value":"Not a very good movie but according to the info it's pretty accurate in depicting torture techniques. The purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the NK POW camps and that's done effectively enough, with surprising frankness for the time. Whatever technical flaws exist (and there are plenty) by watching this you'll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff - again, nasty because it's being done north of the DMZ and not in Guantanamo Bay.<br /><br />I don't think any of the Korean veterans brought up his torture when running for office, and if you watch the movies like this one and Pork Chop Hill in comparison to the Vietnam films. I don't know if it was the people in '54 being trapped in the WWII concepts (the boys tend to wisecrack a lot) or the war or what, but it's interesting to see this from the same system that 16 years

{"value":"I've waited a long time to see DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON and after I watched it, I was really disappointed by it. It's not the Baroque film I expected it to be. The trailer (which I saw on a Something Weird DVD) is much better than the entire film, which is remarkably forgettable. There are almost no stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is interesting but it doesn't even come close to other Baroque styled movies out there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are dull and there's almost nothing dramatic going on, even though we see rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc.<br /><br />The main problem with DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk-a-thon more than anything else. It was almost like watching a book.

{"value":"I don't know what it is about Donald Sutherland's acting style, or vocal style, but he always seems to be acting from behind a massive wad of soggy Kleenex. He's just...I don't know, THICK? Somnambulistic? On meds? Weird.<br /><br />That said, I just saw the flick again for the first time since its original release, and frankly, I don't remember it ending anything LIKE that. A bad ending, too, because nothing gets tied off. What about the dead husband? The annoying child (and was the kid dubbed?)? The Scotland Yard and military pursuers? I would have liked something wrapping things up and giving some dramatic closure to it all, not just the big panoramic pull-away.<br /><br />And what woman sleeps with the man she knows just killed her husband? Even if she was trying to allay Needle's suspicions to protect her kid, she could always have had a headache.

{"value":"It's a ghost story. It's a cannibalism story. It's a revenge story. It's a very poorly done film with a lot of violence. I suppose it follows cheaply along the lines of every slasher movie you've ever seen. It has the usual isolated place, the cocky campers, heading off to the wilderness. Granted, there are some pretty intense scenes. It's just so dull. Bad editing and the whole works. There are ghost children who sound like they are talking into a wastebasket. I'm not really sure what rules the ghosts and the psycho with the seed cap are playing by. It also has the gross out scene where a man eats a piece of meat which is actually what's left of his wife. A friend of mine once asked me why it is necessary to show this kind of gratuitous, sick violence. I fear that it's just another step in our desensitized evolution. Three is no cleverness here, no tongue in cheek, only a sad waste of time.

{"value":"Jean Luc Godard's Marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film as you're likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker. Bits of political theater, mind-numbingly boring and interminable, are interspersed with the making of \"Sympathy for the Devil\", featuring the Rolling Stones in the studio.<br /><br />The process of the song's development, from Mick Jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar, to the backing vocals being recorded towards the end, is fascinating, and it's worth renting this film just to see the bits with the Stones. Almost half the movie is devoted to this, so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops, you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the Stones put a song together.<br /><br />When I had this on laserdisc, I valiantly attempted to watch it all, but I don't see how anyone could get through it. I finally gave up and just chapter-skipped my way to the Stones segments.","finished_norm":["jean","luc","godard","marxist","polem","be","a","close","to","unwatch","a","film","a","you","re","like","to","see","from","a","internation","respect","filmmak","bit","of","polit","theater","mindnumbingli","bore","and","intermin","be","interspers","with","the","make","of","sympathi","for","the","devil","featur","the","roll","stone","in","the","studiobr","br","the","process","of","the","song","develop","from","mick","jagger","plai","a","demo","on","acoust","guitar","to","the","back","vocal","be","record","toward","the","end","be","fascin","and","it","worth","rent","thi","film","just","to","see","the","bit","with","the","stone","almost","half","the","movi","be","devot","to","thi","so","thank","to","the","miracl","of","chapter","stop","you","can","skip","all","the","bizarr","polit","skit","and","just","watch","the","stone","put","a","song","togetherbr","br","when","i","have","thi","on","laserdisc","i","valiantli","attempt","to","watch","it","all","but","i","do","not","see","how","anyon","can","get","through","it","i","final","give","up","and","just","chapterskip","my","wai","to","the","stone","segment"],"filtered":["jean","luc","godard","marxist","polem","close","unwatch","film","re","like","see","internation","respect","filmmak","bit","polit","theater","mindnumbingli","bore","intermin","interspers","make","sympathi","devil","featur","roll","stone","studiobr","br","process","song","develop","mick","jagger","plai","demo","acoust","guitar","back","vocal","record","toward","end","fascin","worth","rent","thi","film","see","bit","stone","almost","half","movi","devot","thi","thank","miracl","chapter","stop","skip","bizarr","polit","skit","watch","stone","put","song","togetherbr","br","thi","laserdisc","valiantli","attempt","watch","see","anyon","get","final","give","chapterskip","wai","stone","segment"],"filtered2":["jean","luc","godard","marxist","polem","close","unwatch","re","like","see","internation","respect","filmmak","bit","polit","theater","mindnumbingli","bore","intermin","interspers","make","sympathi","devil","featur","roll","stone","studiobr","process","song","develop","mick","jagger","plai","demo","acoust","guitar","back","vocal","record","toward","end","fascin","worth","rent","see","bit","stone","almost","half","devot","thank","miracl","chapter","stop","skip","bizarr","polit","skit","watch","stone","put","song","togetherbr","laserdisc","valiantli","attempt","watch","see","anyon","get","final","give","chapterskip","wai","stone","segment"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,24,30,33,40,63,68,108,131,156,158,159,177,206,219,295,305,315,320,323,328,424,563,575,651,661,695,795,825,931,1020,1100,1258,1381,1411,1492,1532,1675,1836,2046,2301,2840,3167,3556,4221,4235,4680,4686,4753,4774,4964,5269,6279,6424,7572,7907],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,24,30,33,40,63,68,108,131,156,158,159,177,206,219,295,305,315,320,323,328,424,563,575,651,661,695,795,825,931,1020,1100,1258,1381,1411,1492,1532,1675,1836,2046,2301,2840,3167,3556,4221,4235,4680,4686,4753,4774,4964,5269,6279,6424,7572,7907],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.6284968758320737,1.8729627573220065,2.0064197866819473,2.138507503627933,2.2512118082053005,2.3451551414151686,2.3106972614914807,2.300267965194495,2.458149992634611,2.597304642813496,2.5792094178355414,2.7910771187233068,2.8612813773965557,2.854312708080462,2.938298364153555,3.0433232530252132,6.310084991849437,3.212973749990824,3.459754308221302,7.262891089427001,3.5474598886404074,3.5727776966246974,3.6284289511740746,3.784589681929357,3.850067611308864,3.9241755834625858,4.100845126825194,17.996359947839487,4.34596758485818,8.899914596764454,4.715065048795469,4.499089986959872,4.869215728622727,4.706176101378222,4.77960356993304,4.979216623837056,5.322690055917252,5.3560264761848435,5.5623629091826725,5.695894301807195,6.032366538428407,5.999576715605417,6.543192162194399,6.032366538428407,6.2980697041614135,6.0662680901040895,6.101359409915359,6.868614562629026,6.489124940924123,6.543192162194399,7.0356686472921925,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.840841050757759E-5,4.8081981278562464E-5,0.09890280382831992,4.817579486281693E-5,4.817658416897586E-5,4.8109242931828696E-5,4.82523265610367E-5,4.8088904769689505E-5,4.819702615809677E-5,5.3471969550415806E-5,6.227573451479348E-5,4.8011278674958846E-5,4.890738538277434E-5,0.14730352863253424,4.804628799851978E-5,4.7913508788513226E-5,4.910865133036091E-5,0.22200050074331165,4.81071307586168E-5,4.81470030167135E-5,4.861285350968523E-5,4.8304657764349156E-5,4.835965994534095E-5,

{"value":"I know nothing of the Iliad so can not comment on it's accuracy to that story. However, as a stand alone film I found this very boring. The battle scenes tried to be large and spectacular but they were just obvious CGI.<br /><br />The acting is poor and no doubt Brad Pitt was cast just to attract the ladies. But he does not make a good warrior, too pretty i am afraid.<br /><br />Good points are is the design. This film does look good with the landscape and castle buildings/walls impressive. I do like a film that at least tries to get the characters accents true but this film just seems to ignore it completely. we hear American, Scottish English anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilisation.<br /><br />All in all, I do not recommend this film for a family sit down.

{"value":"To compare this squalor with an old, low budget porno flick would be an insult to the old, low budget porno flick. The animal scenes have no meaning nor do they represent this man and his crimes even in the broadest sense of abstractions. The synopsis on the back of the DVD case says in part, \"gripping retelling of the BTK Killer's reign of terror.\" This is NOT a retelling. A retelling would suggest that you are being told the truth of what happened or how or why. None of these things are true. I'm an enthusiastic studier of serial killers and have seen some pretty crappy movies about them and honestly, this IS NOT one of them. This isn't even about the BTK killer. Save yourself some time and a few bucks and rent Dahmer instead. THAT serial killer movie is accurate and true.

{"value":"This show is dull, lame, and basically rips off all sorts of various things in order to make it \"original.\" First off: The animation is so ugly... Johnny's hideous... and everyone's annoying. The twins look like teen female Dexters from \"Dexter's Lab,\" and Johnny is almost like a more intelligent male Dee Dee (also from \"Dexter's Lab.\") Secondly: The plots... are painfully lame, making them hard to follow. The gags are corny, and nothing really makes me feel compelled to laugh a little bit... especially when it tries to be funny. I only saw two episodes, but those alone turned me off.<br /><br />Third off: The whole theme song starts off by ripping off the tune to Green Day's \"American Idiot.\" And, while I am not a big fan of that band, I find it really dumb that they would take the same opening melody, and then subtly change it, in order to make it their own.<br /><br />Case in point... it's a big fat ugly bore.

{"value":"This movie had what sounded like a good premise: 9 people facing their fears to win one million dollars. Unfortunately, it did not turn out to be a good movie. There are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene. A few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts. The acting is bad, but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness. What's really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into like a 5 minute western, and at the end, the twists, of which their were several, don't make sense with the rest of the movie. It seemed as though the director just added stuff on because he thought it would look cool, while conveniently ignoring the plot of the movie up to that point. It just didn't make a lot of sense. The only creepy thing was the old people dancing down the hall, but that doesn't even come close to making up for the rest of this mess.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","have","what","sound","like","a","good","premis","peopl","face","their","fear","to","win","on","million","dollar","unfortun","it","do","not","turn","out","to","be","a","good","movi","there","be","sever","scene","that","be","wai","too","long","and","realli","pointless","like","the","danc","scene","a","few","scene","be","just","a","excus","to","point","the","camera","at","femal","bodi","part","the","act","be","bad","but","some","of","the","line","be","amus","in","their","aw","what","realli","strang","be","that","toward","the","end","of","the","movi","it","turn","into","like","a","minut","western","and","at","the","end","the","twist","of","which","their","be","sever","do","not","make","sens","with","the","rest","of","the","movi","it","seem","a","though","the","director","just","add","stuff","on","becaus","he","think","it","would","look","cool","while","conveni","ignor","the","plot","of","the","movi","up","to","that","point","it","just","do","not","make","a","lot","of","sens","the","onli","creepi","thing","be","the","old","peopl","danc","down","the","hall","but","that","doe","not","even","come","close","to","make","up","for","the","rest","of","thi","mess"],"filtered":["thi","movi","sound","like","good","premis","peopl","face","fear","win","million","dollar","unfortun","turn","good","movi","sever","scene","wai","long","realli","pointless","like","danc","scene","scene","excus","point","camera","femal","bodi","part","act","bad","line","amus","aw","realli","strang","toward","end","movi","turn","like","minut","western","end","twist","sever","make","sens","rest","movi","seem","though","director","add","stuff","becaus","think","look","cool","conveni","ignor","plot","movi","point","make","lot","sens","onli","creepi","thing","old","peopl","danc","hall","doe","even","come","close","make","rest","thi","mess"],"filtered2":["sound","like","good","premis","peopl","face","fear","win","million","dollar","unfortun","turn","good","sever","scene","wai","long","realli","pointless","like","danc","scene","scene","excus","point","camera","femal","bodi","part","act","bad","line","amus","aw","realli","strang","toward","end","turn","like","minut","western","end","twist","sever","make","sens","rest","seem","though","director","add","stuff","becaus","think","look","cool","conveni","ignor","plot","point","make","lot","sens","onli","creepi","thing","old","peopl","danc","hall","doe","even","come","close","make","rest","mess"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,9,11,12,13,16,18,19,21,22,23,24,29,32,33,34,35,58,59,61,66,67,72,86,96,99,107,138,173,178,226,227,231,251,295,299,316,361,376,407,417,422,435,481,484,489,492,534,563,617,708,755,763,770,807,812,1039,2181,2473],"values":[3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,9,11,12,13,16,18,19,21,22,23,24,29,32,33,34,35,58,59,61,66,67,72,86,96,99,107,138,173,178,226,227,231,251,295,299,316,361,376,407,417,422,435,481,484,489,492,534,563,617,708,755,763,770,807,812,1039,2181,2473],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.9381148836729736,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,3.9371420340352055,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,2.6420723132238515,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.865701314626681,1.8693254449200722,1.8818517047392527,3.859446346783224,1.9570915389266579,1.9209463754160525,2.031112399272319,4.078141625743051,2.056430207256609,2.1439533986393955,2.2907365189289424,4.8737648638280495,2.532833256045391,5.188174963723441,2.6005321873043625,2.7049353070058615,2.6942272927333892,2.7910771187233068,2.7949961309240425,5.756414056559796,3.0399731661399314,3.1569204307489187,3.120015873813468,3.1932880749197934,3.2090054908152035,3.2829611516442836,3.353630724994973,3.291526514503207,3.3956930001684253,7.2033628856140925,3.4272107604888307,3.459754308221302,3.5119855004467477,3.6683728173057184,3.79165684915245,3.7465885637507435,4.0536665665501035,3.900174431363043,3.952924996748572,4.145296889396028,5.00274712124725,5.1994574154933035]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.038646809558669E-5,6.991183568620519E-5,7.045533354429428E-5,7.004824187648953E-5,7.004938953806717E-5,6.99514744900357E-5,7.015951997627767E-5,6.99219025337264E-5,7.00791124601789E-5,7.774894980655016E-5,0.9944295629632622,6.980903316696028E-5,7.111198415292631E-5,7.212641563155805E-5,6.98599371857048E-5,6.966687446104828E-5,7.14046274983696E-5,7.016609339371318E-5,6.994840336229504E-5,7.000637815206803E-5,7.068373092025561E-5,7.023561023691077E-5,7.031558413435904E-5,7.039134128973023E-5,7.093155867079584E-5,7.056060658770958E

{"value":"I can not believe such slanted, jingoistic material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material. Early on, from such telling lines like \"we want to make sure they are playing for the right team\" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows it's true face. The crass manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden, is as poor a representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the Irish Catholics in the story; a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent, so far from attempting art.

{"value":"I know I've already added a comment but I just wanted to clarify something...<br /><br />I'm not some old fogey from the Baby Boom generation that grew up glued to a flickering b/w picture of Phil Silvers, Jackie Gleason etc.<br /><br />Bilko was already 20 years old before I was born but I had the pleasure of discovering Phil Silver's Bilko courtesy of BBC2. I wonder if I would have enjoyed Steve Martin's travesty if I hadn't seen or heard of Phil Silvers - I don't know - maybe I would have.<br /><br />Some of the other reviewers who think this movie is worthy of a '10' admit that they haven't seen the original. I can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode. If after watching the original Ernie, Colonel Hall, Ritzig & Emma, Duane Doberman, Henshaw, Dino, Flashman, Zimmerman, Mullin et al you still think that Steve Martin's film is woth anything above a

{"value":"can any movie become more naive than this? you cant believe a piece of this script. and its ssooooo predictable that you can tell the plot and the ending from the first 10 minutes. the leading actress seems like she wants to be Barbie (but she doesn't make it, the doll has MORE acting skills).<br /><br />the easiness that the character passes and remains in a a music school makes the phantom of the opera novel seem like a historical biography. i wont even comment on the shallowness of the characters but the ONE good thing of the film is Madsen's performance which manages to bring life to a melo-like one-dimensional character.<br /><br />The movie is so cheesy that it sticks to your teeth. i can think some 13 year old Britney-obsessed girls shouting \"O, do give us a break! If we want fairy tales there is always the Brothers Grimm book hidden somewhere in the attic\".

{"value":"Even though an animated film it really bored everyone under at least 6.<br /><br />As a grown up who grew up in an area with wild horses and native americans, it felt this was a combination of PC mixed in with too many fantasy films created by people who never lived in the area they filmed about. Talk to those who have lived on horse back, most treat their animals like family members, regardless of background. Regardless of background we have dealt with good and bad breakers of wild horses. I had to explain that was a real life issues to us vs the movie makers views to children who were surprised to see how PC showed a world different than what they knew in reality.<br /><br />This dreamworks break from the normal disney or dreamworks fare of cute talking animals burning up the screen was nice from the older viewer point of view.

{"value":"I used to LOVE this movie as a kid but, seeing it again 20+ years later, it actually sucks. Up The Academy might have been ahead of it's time back in 1980, but it has almost nothing to offer today! Movies like Caddyshack and Stripes hold-up much better today than this steaming dogpile. No T&A. No great jokes except for the one-liners we've all heard a million times by now.<br /><br />I recently bought the DVD in hopes that it would be the gem I remembered it being. Well, I was WAY off! The soundtrack had only 2-3 widely-recognizable hits (not the smash compilation others had mentioned) and the frequent voice-overs were terrible. The only thing that was interesting, to me, was predicting what the character's lines were before they said them. Yep, I watched this movie that much back then! <br /><br />The only reason I am writing this review is to give my two cents on why this movie should be forgotten, sorry to say.

{"value":"\"After the atomic bombs carried by a shot-down Soviet bomber explode in the Arctic, the creature 'Gammera' is released from his hibernation. The giant prehistoric turtle proceeds on a path to Tokyo and destroys anything in his path. The military and the scientific community rush to find a means to stop this monster before Tokyo is laid to waste,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. <br /><br />The re-produced for American audiences version of this, the first film in the \"Gamera\" series, adds English language material that is even funnier than the regularly dubbed Japanese fare. Clearly, the monster is following in the footsteps of \"Godzilla\". Taking his cue from ABC's faddish \"Batman!\" TV series, musician Wes Farrell's ludicrous theme song heightens the US version's camp appeal.<br /><br />*** Gammera the Invincible (12/15/66) Sandy

{"value":"This had to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I'm 64 years old and a football fan. I went expecting to see a football movie. About 10 minutes into it, I began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie (particularly the acting) could have gotten into a theater. About half way through, I whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie. Although I was a little offended (and can see how some could be VERY offended if they were not Christian) at being preached to in a movie theater, it wasn't that big a deal. It was, however, a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and unrealistic behavior and, above all, the quality of the acting. It is an appropriate movie for a church outing but to be shown in a church auditorium and not in a theater. Do I go to church? Yes. Do I want to go to church when I attend a movie?
