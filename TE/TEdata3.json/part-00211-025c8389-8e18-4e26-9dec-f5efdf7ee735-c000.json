{"value":"I feel blessed to own what is known as the worst Steven Seagal movie ever made. I knew I was on to something special when Steven opened his mouth and someone else's voice came out. By the middle of the film my eyes were beginning to hurt and I was almost falling out of my chair with uncontrollable laughter.<br /><br />Steven is Steven (with an ever changing voice) and totally unbelievable in his role (as always). Who the hell lets people with bad nappy-hair pony tail mullets into the Forces anyway? He also always writes himself into totally unbelievable love interests with women at least 20 years his junior. The supporting actors all look like they've been shot in the dark - btw, did they shoot this movie in the dark with just a penlight torch for lighting? <br /><br />This is truly abominable in every way possible. Invite all your friends around and make a social event out of it - this one's truly special.","finished_norm":["i","feel","bless","to","own","what","be","know","a","the","wrong","steven","seagal","movi","ever","make","i","know","i","be","on","to","someth","special","when","steven","open","hi","mouth","and","someon","els","voic","come","out","by","the","middl","of","the","film","my","ey","be","begin","to","hurt","and","i","be","almost","fall","out","of","my","chair","with","uncontrol","laughterbr","br","steven","be","steven","with","a","ever","chang","voic","and","total","unbeliev","in","hi","role","a","alwai","who","the","hell","let","peopl","with","bad","nappyhair","poni","tail","mullet","into","the","forc","anywai","he","conjur","alwai","write","himself","into","total","unbeliev","love","interest","with","woman","at","littl","year","hi","junior","the","support","actor","all","look","like","thei","have","be","shoot","in","the","dark","btw","do","thei","shoot","thi","movi","in","the","dark","with","just","a","penlight","torch","for","light","br","br","thi","be","truli","abomin","in","everi","wai","possibl","invit","all","your","friend","around","and","make","a","social","event","out","of","it","thi","on","truli","special"],"filtered":["feel","bless","know","wrong","steven","seagal","movi","ever","make","know","someth","special","steven","open","hi","mouth","someon","els","voic","come","middl","film","ey","begin","hurt","almost","fall","chair","uncontrol","laughterbr","br","steven","steven","ever","chang","voic","total","unbeliev","hi","role","alwai","hell","let","peopl","bad","nappyhair","poni","tail","mullet","forc","anywai","conjur","alwai","write","total","unbeliev","love","interest","woman","littl","year","hi","junior","support","actor","look","like","thei","shoot","dark","btw","thei","shoot","thi","movi","dark","penlight","torch","light","br","br","thi","truli","abomin","everi","wai","possibl","invit","friend","around","make","social","event","thi","truli","special"],"filtered2":["feel","bless","know","wrong","steven","seagal","ever","make","know","someth","special","steven","open","mouth","someon","els","voic","come","middl","ey","begin","hurt","almost","fall","chair","uncontrol","laughterbr","steven","steven","ever","chang","voic","total","unbeliev","role","alwai","hell","let","peopl","bad","nappyhair","poni","tail","mullet","forc","anywai","conjur","alwai","write","total","unbeliev","love","interest","woman","littl","year","junior","support","actor","look","like","shoot","dark","btw","shoot","dark","penlight","torch","light","truli","abomin","everi","wai","possibl","invit","friend","around","make","social","event","truli","special"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,9,14,16,23,25,26,33,34,39,41,43,44,53,54,57,60,65,70,85,98,117,124,128,131,139,147,161,169,184,196,197,203,242,278,281,338,342,353,368,386,394,402,428,459,470,554,571,863,941,975,1194,1402,1916,2034,2616,3359,3374,3459,3634,4025,5860,7025,7872],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,9,14,16,23,25,26,33,34,39,41,43,44,53,54,57,60,65,70,85,98,117,124,128,131,139,147,161,169,184,196,197,203,242,278,281,338,342,353,368,386,394,402,428,459,470,554,571,863,941,975,1194,1402,1916,2034,2616,3359,3374,3459,3634,4025,5860,7025,7872],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,3.209458785004948,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,2.094675786251684,2.011190219103739,2.0881990796736947,4.5594602370234405,2.2323930368088845,2.3409902041158843,2.2512118082053005,2.2939035841256437,2.2844323215331563,2.4323182980210873,2.4071371113909277,4.992499677733764,2.478925055209576,5.116663665627972,5.139521057275218,2.689504733779216,2.8336934208777267,2.832333801361687,2.9720957437368454,5.941068926339787,3.0266839340212486,6.269229346469241,3.0433232530252132,3.0967381889441223,3.084424928710765,6.7442140023250925,3.2850956241729166,3.3814747511661465,3.439602492783994,6.934834361933742,3.944626193933877,3.9612932464190886,4.086456389373095,17.996359947839487,5.583416318380505,4.869215728622727,4.956227105612356,5.2288713006995975,5.719991853386255,5.626901430320244,5.719991853386255,5.719991853386255,5.907203395474402,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.53603632154079E-4,1.5346751621014666E-4,1.535054085254076E-4,1.5347454902809725E-4,1.5348907357368966E-4,1.534666700365607E-4,1.5351440030156777E-4,1.5344383669907966E-4,1.5346754864393734E-4,1.5362614072565942E-4,1.5484511943784812E-4,1.5346780213264206E-4,1.53613145839434

{"value":"I've never understood the appeal of Garbo. She always comes across in her films as stuck up, not all that alluring, and that annoying voice that could have drowned out the tuba section. She was also a very limited actress, like Gloria Swanson far better off left in the silent era. In this her last film, her performance is very average and even unassured. She tries hard but it all comes to nothing because the script is even worse than her acting.<br /><br />A would be screwball romcom that is never once believable and never gets off the ground (even though Melvyn Douglas manages to get airborne in the skiing scenes, which are really the only amusing thing here).<br /><br />There was potential but the script fails in almost every department, wasting every actor in it. Douglas and Garbo had good enough chemistry together but this one isn't even a spot on Ninotchka, which I also found to be extremely

{"value":"I am an actor,producer, director and what i am about to say are facts. This project was the worst film in movie making history. From producer to director and the edit of this so called film is a joke and i mean a BIG joke. Why would Blockbuster released such crap? I take my work very serious and this film is an insult to my profession. Was the director trying to make a bad movie? I don't think so. I seen bad Zombie movies, but this takes the cake the Coffie and everything on the damn table. THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!! I really hate to talk bad about other filmmakers because i am one myself, but please consider in taking up a different profession. I respect the fact that you completed a movie, but i have to ask you \" WERE YOU SMOKING CRACK \", I mean the makeup on your girls, the scary Zombies, what were you thinking.

{"value":"Worse than the rating it has been given. This is a typical SciFi movie nowadays: bad to awful acting, a script that is poorly written, and shoddy direction. From the opening scene where DeMille is burying his set to the end, this movie is terrible. In the beginning scenes this movie has Moses (which was Charlton Heston in the DeMille film), Pharoah (Yul Brynner) and Nefretiri (Anne Baxtor) overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand. The characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to \"supposedly\" be. The fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance. The screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert. I was sorely disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to do a film of such low

{"value":"Scary Movie 2 was a grave disappointment. Simply referencing movies, like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy. The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter. The movie plummets from there unfortunately. The acting is awful. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place. The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced. Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, werent funny to anyone in my theater. The movie, thankfully, comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor) I dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make Miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers.

{"value":"The direction had clearly stated that this film's idea and plot is totally original....however, as to those who have read 'slam dunk' comic, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar and even some jokes...<br /><br />Another note is Jay Chow himself DO NOT know Kung Fu, it just won't impress anyone if he tries to act like he can, many people today can see the differences.. Luckily the movie do not contain much of KunG Fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects...<br /><br />I think that Jay's acting is still a pain to watch, especially when almost everyone else in the film is so much better. The only reason I think why Jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity.<br /><br />Despite how hard I wish to stop anyone from watching this thus making this \"orginal\" movie getting what

{"value":"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie has nothing positive about it. Some of you people actually like this movie! I've seen a lot of Dracula movies and I've liked everyone that I've seen, but when I saw this movie I said to myself, \"What the hell is this?\" What a stupid movie. Now they have Dracula becoming who he is because he is Judas. For those of you who don't know who Judas is, he betrayed Jesus Christ and then felt so guilty he hung himself. You have to be kidding me. That's the dumbest reason I've ever heard for why Dracula became evil. Who asked for a reason anyway? What a piece of sh** this movie is. Who ever came up with this sorry excuse for a movie should be beaten. Even the Dracula is horrible. If you ever saw this movie you wouldn't even think it was Dracula. Wow, Dracula 2000! Is that title supposed to impress me? Don't waste your time or your money on this

{"value":"I absolutely adore the book written by Robin Klein, so I was very excited when I heard that a movie based on the book was in the making.<br /><br />But I was severely disappointed with the movie when I did see it because it didn't capture what I loved about the book - the absolutely ridiculously funny Erica and the interesting way in which she views the world.<br /><br />From the start of the movie, I realised that things weren't the same as I had imagined in the book. So, I just went along for the ride. It wasn't all that bad, I guess. Miss Belmont was totally different to what I had imagined her to be! I didn't think she would be one to smoke and drink - Jean Kittson, who plays her, is hilarious!<br /><br />On it's own, I thought the movie and it's actors/actresses in it did a good job, but alas, I'm such a fan of the book (one of my all time favourite books) that I couldn't help but feel disappointed

This is potentially a very good story, but it fails to hit the mark. The script is very weak - the plot has so many holes that it would make a great dip net for the fishing scenes. The characters were not well developed and the storyline jumps around so much that I found myself asking the question \"How did we get here?\" at least a half dozen times during the movie.<br /><br />There was a lack of any chemistry between the cast members. This is probably related to Lindsay Lohan's antics during the filming. It was pretty clear that everyone showed up and did their job, but didn't commit to their roles.<br /><br />This is not a movie worth seeing...go for a walk, play a board game, take a nice warm bath and save your money for something that's worth it!","finished_norm":["i","just","come","from","see","thi","movi","and","decid","to","see","what","other","think","of","it","i","be","leav","wonder","if","thi","peopl","who","give","glow","review","see","the","same","film","thi","be","potenti","a","veri","good","stori","but","it","fail","to","hit","the","mark","the","script","be","veri","weak","the","plot","have","so","mani","hole","that","it","would","make","a","great","dip","net","for","the","fish","scene","the","charact","be","not","good","develop","and","the","storylin","jump","around","so","much","that","i","find","myself","ask","the","question","how","do","we","get","here","at","littl","a","half","dozen","time","dure","the","moviebr","br","there","be","a","lack","of","ani","chemistri","between","the","cast","member","thi","be","probabl","relat","to","lindsai","lohan","antic","dure","the","film","it","be","pretti","clear","that","everyon","show","up","and","do","their","job","but","do","not","commit","to","their","rolesbr","br","thi","be","not","a","movi","worth","seeinggo","for","a","walk","plai","a","board","game","take","a","nice","warm","bath","and","save","your","monei","for","someth","that","worth","it"],"filtered":["come","see","thi","movi","decid","see","think","leav","wonder","thi","peopl","give","glow","review","see","film","thi","potenti","veri","good","stori","fail","hit","mark","script","veri","weak","plot","mani","hole","make","great","dip","net","fish","scene","charact","good","develop","storylin","jump","around","much","find","ask","question","get","littl","half","dozen","time","dure","moviebr","br","lack","ani","chemistri","cast","member","thi","probabl","relat","lindsai","lohan","antic","dure","film","pretti","clear","everyon","show","job","commit","rolesbr","br","thi","movi","worth","seeinggo","walk","plai","board","game","take","nice","warm","bath","save","monei","someth","worth"],"filtered2":["come","see","decid","see","think","leav","wonder","peopl","give","glow","review","see","potenti","veri","good","stori","fail","hit","mark","script","veri","weak","plot","mani","hole","make","great","dip","net","fish","scene","charact","good","develop","storylin","jump","around","find","ask","question","get","littl","half","dozen","time","dure","moviebr","lack","ani","chemistri","cast","member","probabl","relat","lindsai","lohan","antic","dure","pretti","clear","everyon","show","job","commit","rolesbr","worth","seeinggo","walk","plai","board","game","take","nice","warm","bath","save","monei","someth","worth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,8,10,12,14,15,17,19,23,27,28,30,31,32,34,38,40,50,51,53,74,77,78,92,98,126,148,175,176,183,189,206,215,219,239,246,249,262,289,294,306,320,374,378,379,388,465,515,547,590,618,674,717,810,903,969,1132,1323,1332,1922,2021,2520,2566,3442,3992,4915,5971,7143,7327],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,8,10,12,14,15,17,19,23,27,28,30,31,32,34,38,40,50,51,53,74,77,78,92,98,126,148,175,176,183,189,206,215,219,239,246,249,262,289,294,306,320,374,378,379,388,465,515,547,590,618,674,717,810,903,969,1132,1323,1332,1922,2021,2520,2566,3442,3992,4915,5971,7143,7327],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.967100616408184,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.364847727375781,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,1.9486336368009016,1.9463902258768238,2.0064197866819473,2.0489535369135887,2.0881990796736947,2.2391270689902285,2.3018654096236517,2.3791142619576227,2.5040471493269134,2.4885128563647294,2.498193474075453,2.597304642813496,2.605934685587711,5.158418835671083,5.318680067465897,2.673149229007135,2.6754694156628323,2.726701583487816,2.8282659991423613,2.886778509330039,2.8739486825973213,2.938298364153555,3.4572130107926293,3.130944944345658,3.1272886331425473,3.0914425013694116,3.2681460658591432,3.3956930001684253,3.432149042129413,3.4986697244709752,3.5642670069567886,3.6405503117064195,3.7398317812878634,3.8425769395797067,3.948766986599908,4.0536665665501035,4.218628162481577,4.383707912841026,4.436351646326448,5.064116067623542,5.089758498236879,5.2288713006995975,5.3064295350454715,5.583416318380505,6.255510089742618,6.137727054086234,6.600350576034347,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.5554831722340402E-4,1.5541047799571756E-4,1.554488500432524E-4,1.5541759985203185E-4,1.5543230828433683E-4,1.5540962110922649E-4,1.5545795565899176E-4,1.55386498

{"value":"Full marks for the content of this film, as a Brit I was not aware that there was segregation in the US Navy during WWII. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the movie is pathetic, direction is non existent, the acting is wooden and the script is just one cliché after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I sat and cringed from the start until the end at the very poor way that this had been put together. This could have been a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the US was new, unique and also interesting. The sad fact of the matter is the way that it was put together. It is unfortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been squandered on a low budget, badly directed movie. I only hope that some time in the future, one of the major studios will take this theme and do it justice.","finished_norm":["full","mark","for","the","content","of","thi","film","a","a","brit","i","be","not","awar","that","there","be","segreg","in","the","u","navi","dure","wwii","a","veri","brave","attempt","to","bring","thi","fact","to","the","world","howev","the","movi","be","pathet","direct","be","non","exist","the","act","be","wooden","and","the","script","be","just","on","cliché","after","anoth","i","can","honestli","sai","that","thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","i","sit","and","cring","from","the","start","until","the","end","at","the","veri","poor","wai","that","thi","have","be","put","togeth","thi","can","have","be","a","great","movi","the","stori","for","mani","of","u","outsid","of","the","u","be","new","uniqu","and","conjur","interest","the","sad","fact","of","the","matt","be","the","wai","that","it","be","put","togeth","it","be","unfortun","that","a","true","stori","like","thi","which","can","have","chang","peopl","attitud","have","be","squander","on","a","low","budget","badli","direct","movi","i","onli","hope","that","some","time","in","the","futur","on","of","the","major","studio","will","take","thi","theme","and","do","it","justic"],"filtered":["full","mark","content","thi","film","brit","awar","segreg","u","navi","dure","wwii","veri","brave","attempt","bring","thi","fact","world","howev","movi","pathet","direct","non","exist","act","wooden","script","cliché","anoth","honestli","sai","thi","wrong","movi","ever","see","sit","cring","start","end","veri","poor","wai","thi","put","togeth","thi","great","movi","stori","mani","u","outsid","u","new","uniqu","conjur","interest","sad","fact","matt","wai","put","togeth","unfortun","true","stori","like","thi","chang","peopl","attitud","squander","low","budget","badli","direct","movi","onli","hope","time","futur","major","studio","take","thi","theme","justic"],"filtered2":["full","mark","content","brit","awar","segreg","u","navi","dure","wwii","veri","brave","attempt","bring","fact","world","howev","pathet","direct","non","exist","act","wooden","script","cliché","anoth","honestli","wrong","ever","see","sit","cring","start","end","veri","poor","wai","put","togeth","great","stori","mani","u","outsid","u","new","uniqu","conjur","interest","sad","fact","matt","wai","put","togeth","unfortun","true","stori","like","chang","peopl","attitud","squander","low","budget","badli","direct","onli","hope","time","futur","major","studio","take","theme","justic"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,11,15,17,21,23,24,25,31,33,39,44,50,51,60,71,73,77,87,97,102,112,113,146,159,165,177,181,217,227,239,244,250,256,270,278,304,336,404,408,448,455,523,528,534,602,717,757,791,844,891,932,1142,1300,1424,1625,1822,1828,2348,2606,3172,3617,4166,4422],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,11,15,17,21,23,24,25,31,33,39,44,50,51,60,71,73,77,87,97,102,112,113,146,159,165,177,181,217,227,239,244,250,256,270,278,304,336,404,408,448,455,523,528,534,602,717,757,791,844,891,932,1142,1300,1424,1625,1822,1828,2348,2606,3172,3617,4166,4422],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,2.4001215597131385,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.4070669811451506,2.803707089537043,1.5538940054862738,1.604729392502474,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,1.9214926742550966,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,2.115024371522662,4.109111584924517,4.175107420354542,6.739988699036795,2.1521782565202803,2.326138445979858,4.60053593038899,2.448847599972298,2.458149992634611,2.4442286541160034,2.6113665294700725,2.6005321873043625,2.6593400337329487,2.634508058031767,2.6812935439488212,2.748952192422636,5.463207108176046,2.8336934208777267,2.871119826396843,2.9233055795674137,3.1419947805322432,3.130944944345658,3.2681460658591432,3.2787058260741455,3.4986697244709752,3.4198487640477615,3.4933926673701317,3.506637894120152,3.7398317812878634,3.7165362186843414,3.8240921249056035,3.8690435127678695,3.8767358583910254,4.058285512406398,4.263079925052412,4.3773181147422555,4.5432147918688095,4.671389985292807,4.789173020949191,4.770124825978496,5.102830579804232,5.243909178064138,5.626901430320244,5.822646007446338,5.907203395474402,5.9370563586240825]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.616894830096464E-4,1.6154620178448817E-4,1.6158608878962381E-4,1.615536048171026E-4,1.6156889394949392E-4,1.6154531106746717E-4,1.6159555390199312E-4,1.6152127575996226E-4,1.6154623592562646E-4,1.6171317645524456E-4,1.6299632344213256E-4,1.615465027582335E-4,1.6169949750503983E-4,1.617163438029195E-4,1.6164288029044875E-4,1.6155424115336952E-4,1.6160982206040226E-4,1.6168

{"value":"Contrary to another reviewer, I think that this is WELL-written, especially the more fictional it is, because greater imagination would be required; and well acted, because there were no other characters with whom to share the focus of these dozen-minutes-plus, well-done monologues. But I'm just not entertained by such solemn, pious rememberances. Everybody has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others. Everybody has problems and some are more intense than others. These are just ten, not-very-atypical stories and problems, exemplifying how anybody's life (or part of it) is fodder for film. Then again, I think poorly of TV's reality shows, too. So, if that's your bag, you may like this. It's the kind of stuff that would make for good 'phone and/or internet gossip; but absolutely without other-than-verbal action.

{"value":"I enjoyed the feel of the opening few minutes, but 20-minutes in I was liberally applying the fast-forward button. Far too many shots of Stewart (Michael Zelniker) walking from room to room, down hallways, through doors and down the street, and as many shots of him looking pensive and confused. Gave me the impression that the story had originally been meant as a short (20-30 minutes), and then stretched into a feature as a labour of love between director Grieve and star Zelniker (they co-wrote the screenplay).<br /><br />It might have been more entertaining if any of the characters had anything to say that I hadn't heard said in many other films before, or if the ending wasn't - disappointingly - the one I had predicted three minutes into the film (atypical for an independent/smaller studio film).

{"value":"It's 1982, Two years after the Iranian Embassy Siege which involved the dramatic SAS Rescue from the Balconys, and with a War with Argentina over the Falkland Islands currently taking place, what better film to make than a Gung-Ho \"SAS\" Film that re-creates the Iranian Hostage siege, whilst using Britains Number one action hero of the day, Lewis Collins. throw in Edward Woodward and a few other Well known actors and you've got a winner on your hands?...Well maybe not! The film itself doesn't make the situation serious enough, whilst the acting is quite second rate. it's like a Movie long episode of \"The Professionals\", but without the formula. This film goes nowhere fast and is quite predictable. Maybe Cubby Brocoli watched this film and decided to ditch Lewis Collins as a Touted James Bond Replacement for Roger Moore.

{"value":"Yesterday I saw the movie Flyboys and my girlfriend told me it was the worst movie she's ever seen... Since I thought it was pretty awful as well it got me thinking - which film was the worst film I had ever seen and this was the only film that came to mind.<br /><br />Unfortunately it was a couple of years since I've seen it but I remember the horribly miscast Dean Cain as cocky military man (pretty boy Cain doesn't do cocky very well). The strange deal with the CGI-helicopter when it would probably be cheaper to rent a chopper than to hire some CGI-guys to make it, but my guess is that they found the chopper as a free sample for some CGI program or the producer's son liked to play with his new computer. And how did it look?? Awful. And when the dragon charges through the corridors of the complex then reuse the same shots over and over - looks VERY cheap.<br /><br />Avoid this movie - it is truly

{"value":"This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. Pure drivel. How anyone could develop a connection with the heroine, or have empathy for her, is beyond me. I felt I was watching a case history of a schizoid individual with borderline personality disorder. Just terrible.<br /><br />In its most generous light, this can be seen as an attempt at producing and \"art\" film - except I could not, for the life of me, find any art in it at all.<br /><br />If this woman had lived in todays' world, she would have been whisked off to a mental institution and given a couple of days treatment with anti-psychotic medications. That, or simply allowed to roam the streets and become a bag woman. Why other characters in this movie found anything redeeming in her - and tried to aid her in her quest to become an actress - speaks more to their pathology than any convincing characteristics she had

{"value":"A patient escapes from a mental hospital, killing one of his keepers and then a University professor after he makes his way to the local college. Next semester, the late prof's replacement and a new group of students have to deal with a new batch of killings. The dialogue is so clichéd it is hard to believe that I was able to predict lines in quotes. This is one of those cheap movies that was thrown together in the middle of the slasher era of the '80's. Despite killing the heroine off, this is just substandard junk. Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible effects, horrible horrible horrible!! \"Splatter University\" is just gunk to put in your VCR when you have nothing better to do, although I suggest watching your head cleaner tape, that would be more entertaining.

{"value":"\"Tapeheads\", a scrappy, intermittently funny spoof of the music video business, might have been the perfect comedic short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one deathbed star. It's too bad the filmmakers had to invent a dim side-plot to pad the running time (shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which doesn't do much except take away from the movie's primary strength, sending-up the music culture of the late-'80s). Still, Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here: nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down.

{"value":"Went to watch this movie expecting a 'nothing really much' action flick, still got very disappointed. The opening scene promised a little action with a tinge of comedy. It keeps you hooked for the first half coz till then you are expecting that now its time for the action to kick in. Well, nothing of that sort happens. The movie drags and the ending just thumps you down to a point that you get annoyed.Wonder what was the director thinking. Made no sense watsoever. The movie lacked in all aspects, had no real storyline and it seemed very hollow, even if \"Rambo\" was in it, I don't think he could have helped the rating at all. There is simply no logic to the movie. A perfect way to waste your time and money. By far the most irritating movie i have ever seen and i am sure there will b others who'll have the same viewpoint after enduring it.

{"value":"One Stinko of a movie featuring a shopworn plot and, to be kind, acting of less than Oscar caliber. But to me the single worst flaw was the total misrepresentation of a jet aircraft, and especially a 747. Some of the major blunders:<br /><br />1. No Flight Engineer (or even a flight engineer station. 2. Mis-identifying the F-16 interceptors as F-15's (no resmblance whatsoever). 3. Loading passengers into an \"aft baggage compartment\" supposedly accesible from the cabin - Even if such a compartment existed, placing that much weight that far aft would make the aircraft unflyable. 4. Hollow point bullets that \"won't damage the aircraft\". 5. The entire landing procedure was so bad I wanted to puke. 6. An SR-71 (of all planes) with a pressure seal hatch 7. Opening a cabin door outward - into the wind - in flight!!<br /><br />Ah nuts, it was just a truly lousy movie.

{"value":"30 seconds into the opening credits, I had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie, but I didn't know just how bad. Then the actor playing the evil Nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and I decide that in order to survive this movie, we'll have to turn the volume down, make up our own dialogue and double the speed on the DVD. But that didn't help. About half way through we turned it off. Now, I've lived through some very bad movies before, both with and without the aide of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" and \"Svengoolie,\" but there are just some movies which I doubt even the Bots can save. The biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people hypnotized into believing they're zombies had rotting green skin. I guess they were all hypnotized into death, then hypnotized into rotting themselves.

{"value":"Christopher Guest need not worry, his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is not in trouble of being upstaged in the least especially not by this extremely unfunny jab at RPG-gamers. The jokes are beyond lame. Not enough substance to last the typical length of a (particularly rancid) SNL skit, much less the 87 atrocious minutes I waisted watching this drivel. The great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) deserves much MUCH better. One thing and one thing alone makes the fact that I saw this worth it in my mind and that's posting about it on here so hopefully just hopefully I'll save someone such a bad experience.<br /><br />My

{"value":"The movie itself is not too bad; many comments have pointed out the obvious flaws of the script, but it is watchable. What really gives me the creeps though is that people like Justin Timberlake even get cast for movies, and on top of that for movies like this one. I have to admit I had never heard the man's name before watching this, but the very instant he appeared I was just plain annoyed. The voice is crap, the face is a bad rip-off of Legolas, the posture is horrible, and he cannot even properly coordinate all three of them. Said to say, I was delighted when he got jumped after leaving the disco, because I was hoping from then on it would be Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey only. Too bad I was wrong. These two and also LL Cool J give a very decent performance, and they are the main reason I give this a 4. <br /><br />I see many upcoming movies with the little Timberlake cast... and cannot believe

{"value":"Quite simply this shouldn't have been made. It's predictable and clichéd. The on screen chemistry which made the first \"My Girl\" so captivating is nowhere to be found here, and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced. The writing also leaves much to be desired, some of the 'memorable' lines such as \"earpeircing a barbaric custom\" are just shocking. Where \"My Girl\" provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments, like so many sequels \"My Girl 2\" tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience, and fails miserably. Maybe i'm being hard on this film because of how great the first one was, but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up. Surely this has to come close to \"Son of the mask\" as being one of the worst sequels of all time.

{"value":"A Vietnam vet decides to take over a backwater town run amok, and anyone who steps in his path is eliminated (including women). Released to theaters just prior to \"A Star Is Born\", which turned his career around, this action-drama mishmash starring Kris Kristofferson is wildly off-kilter, thoughtless and mean-spirited. Filmed in Simi Valley, CA, the results are truly unseemly, with redneck clichés and mindless violence making up most of director George Armitage's script. Armitage has gathered a most curious '70s cast for his film, including Jan-Michael Vincent, Victoria Principal, Bernadette Peters, and, in a bit, Loni Anderson; however, the center of the whole thing is Kristofferson, who is gruff and rude throughout. It deserves points I suppose for being a completely unsympathetic drive-in thriller, but the bad vibes (and the ridiculous climax) coat the whole project like an ugly stain. *1/2 from

{"value":"I watched this film because I'm a big fan of River Phoenix and Joaquin Phoenix. I thought I would give their sister a try, Rain Phoenix. I regret checking it out. She was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it. Sissy was just weird and Jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? I have never been so unsatisfied in my life. It was just total rubbish. I can't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. Have Sissy being 'beautiful' didnt get to me. I thought she was everything but that. Those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? WHATS THE POINT??? 0 out of 10, shame the poll doesnt have a 0, doesnt even deserve a 1. Hopefully, Rain is better in other films, I forgive her for this one performance, I mean I wouldnt do much better with that

{"value":"Somewhere inside this movie is a half-hour episode from The Twilight Zone trying to get out. Whereas Cube was taut, well-made, claustrophobic and mind-engaging, I'm afraid Cypher is a bloated, tedious rehash of several well-worn themes which just don't add up to much, especially if you have seen almost any other half-way decent sci-fi film before.<br /><br />Cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending. None of the characters spark off each other, and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy. It is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of Cube. It's not a bad movie, but it is most definitely not a good one.<br /><br />When you've watched the grass grow and paint dry and are bored of your stick insects then by all means watch this film, but

{"value":"A vampire's's henchman wants to call her after falling in love with a five-dollar hooker in this extremely low-budget horror-comedy. I can't explain all the positive comments on this movie. I'll chalk it up to mass hallucination, but it's disconcerting none the less. The one redeeming factor (and this is me being extremely generous here) might be the Grandfather who's the only semi-likable character in this whole mess. Don't waste your money, or time. In fact here's a word of advice, If Troma puts it out on DVD, but does NOT make it themselves, in all likelihood it's crap.<br /><br />Troma DVD Extras:Commentary with Omar and Kirk; second commentary with cast and crew deleted scenes; bloopers; troma interactivity; radiation march; Clip from \"Terror Firmer\"; Theatrical trailer ;Trailers for \"the Rowdy Girls\", \"Teenage Catgirls in Heat\",

{"value":"When you look at this now and hear all the language in here, it's amazing this was rated \"PG,\" but that's the 1970s rating system for you. Peter Falk spews out the Lord's name in vain six times in the first ten minutes alone in this movie! Yet, few people consider that offensive, and certainly not the scumbags who make movies nor the people who \"rate\" them.<br /><br />The cast is a clue to how profane this film can be: Falk, Peter Boyle, Allen Garfield, Warren Oates, Gena Rowlands and Paul Sorvino aren't exactly actors you wouldn't find in \"The Sound Of Music.\"<br /><br />I like heist movies, and a lot of films by director William Friedkin, but this script doesn't deliver and it just has way too much of the \"Sleazy '70s\" feel to it, visually and audibly. For those who loved Falk in TV's \"Columbo\" it must come as a shock to hear him use as much profanity as he did in films.

{"value":"Steve Carpenter cannot make horror movies. First of all, the casting was very wrong for this movie. The only decent part was the hot brown haired girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. This movies has no gore(usually a key ingredient to a horror movie), no action, no acting, and no suspense(also a key ingredient). Wes Bentley is a good actor but he is so dry and plain in this that it's sad. There were a few parts that were supposed to be funny(continuing the teen horror/comedy movies) and no one laughed in the audience. I thought that this movie was rated R, and I didn't pay attention and realized it had been changed to PG-13. Anyway, see this movie if you liked I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. That's the only type of person who would find this movie even remotely scary. And seriously, this is to you Steve Carpenter, stop making horror movies.

{"value":"I laughed all the way through this rotten movie. It's so unbelievable. A woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage, has a breakdown in front of a real estate office. What happens? The office manager comes outside and offers her a job!!! Hilarious! Next thing you know the two women are going at it. Yep, they're lesbians! Nothing rings true in this \"Lifetime for Women with nothing better to do\" movie. Clunky dialogue like \"I don't want to spend the rest of my life feeling like I had a chance to be happy and didn't take it\" doesn't help. There's a wealthy, distant mother who disapproves of her daughter's new relationship. A sassy black maid - unbelievable that in the year 2003, a film gets made in which there's a sassy black maid. Hattie McDaniel must be turning in her grave. The woman has a husband who freaks out and wants custody of the snotty teenage kids. Sheesh!

And I have to say, the first fifteen minutes or so were nostalgic in a way. Then it went all down hill. I didn't expect it to be a dump of politically correct civil rights mumbo jumbo.
