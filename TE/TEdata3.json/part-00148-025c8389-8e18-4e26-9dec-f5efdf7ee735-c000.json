{"value":"For romantic comedies, I often judge the quality of the film based upon the mistiness of my eyes by the end of the experience. Unfortunately for \"The Wedding Date,\" I can only rate the film with 4 out of 10 possible tears.<br /><br />My apologies to fans of Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney, but I did not see much chemistry between their two characters. The premise of the film is a reverse \"Pretty Woman,\" with Dermot playing the role of Nick, a high-priced male escort hired by Debra's character Kat to accompany her to England for her sister's wedding. A romantic relationship presumably develops between patron and client. But the dialogue seemed forced and artificial. And there weren't enough romantic sparks flying in the relationship of Nick and Kat.<br /><br />In a supporting role, Amy Adams was a standout as Kat's sister. Whenever Amy came on screen, she served as a spark plug and catalyst for the film's energy. Perhaps if Amy Adams had been cast in the role of Kat, the film might have had more dynamism. But as it turned out, instead of reaching for Kleenex, I was looking for the Visine in attempt to at least pretend that this film had some genuine sentiment and romance.","finished_norm":["for","romant","comedi","i","often","judg","the","qualiti","of","the","film","base","upon","the","misti","of","my","ey","by","the","end","of","the","experi","unfortun","for","the","wed","date","i","can","onli","rate","the","film","with","out","of","possibl","tearsbr","br","my","apologi","to","fan","of","debra","mess","and","dermot","mulronei","but","i","do","not","see","much","chemistri","between","their","two","charact","the","premis","of","the","film","be","a","revers","pretti","woman","with","dermot","plai","the","role","of","nick","a","highpric","male","escort","hire","by","debra","charact","kat","to","accompani","her","to","england","for","her","sister","wed","a","romant","relationship","presum","develop","between","patron","and","client","but","the","dialogu","seem","forc","and","artifici","and","there","be","not","enough","romant","spark","fly","in","the","relationship","of","nick","and","katbr","br","in","a","support","role","ami","adam","be","a","standout","a","kat","sister","whenev","ami","come","on","screen","she","serv","a","a","spark","plug","and","catalyst","for","the","film","energi","perhap","if","ami","adam","have","be","cast","in","the","role","of","kat","the","film","mai","have","have","much","dynam","but","a","it","turn","out","instead","of","reach","for","kleenex","i","be","look","for","the","visin","in","attempt","to","at","littl","pretend","that","thi","film","have","some","genuin","sentim","and","romanc"],"filtered":["romant","comedi","often","judg","qualiti","film","base","upon","misti","ey","end","experi","unfortun","wed","date","onli","rate","film","possibl","tearsbr","br","apologi","fan","debra","mess","dermot","mulronei","see","much","chemistri","two","charact","premis","film","revers","pretti","woman","dermot","plai","role","nick","highpric","male","escort","hire","debra","charact","kat","accompani","england","sister","wed","romant","relationship","presum","develop","patron","client","dialogu","seem","forc","artifici","enough","romant","spark","fly","relationship","nick","katbr","br","support","role","ami","adam","standout","kat","sister","whenev","ami","come","screen","serv","spark","plug","catalyst","film","energi","perhap","ami","adam","cast","role","kat","film","mai","much","dynam","turn","instead","reach","kleenex","look","visin","attempt","littl","pretend","thi","film","genuin","sentim","romanc"],"filtered2":["romant","comedi","often","judg","qualiti","base","upon","misti","ey","end","experi","unfortun","wed","date","onli","rate","possibl","tearsbr","apologi","fan","debra","mess","dermot","mulronei","see","chemistri","two","charact","premis","revers","pretti","woman","dermot","plai","role","nick","highpric","male","escort","hire","debra","charact","kat","accompani","england","sister","wed","romant","relationship","presum","develop","patron","client","dialogu","seem","forc","artifici","enough","romant","spark","fly","relationship","nick","katbr","support","role","ami","adam","standout","kat","sister","whenev","ami","come","screen","serv","spark","plug","catalyst","energi","perhap","ami","adam","cast","role","kat","mai","dynam","turn","instead","reach","kleenex","look","visin","attempt","littl","pretend","genuin","sentim","romanc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,10,11,14,16,24,34,35,40,46,47,70,78,92,93,96,127,128,140,152,177,192,202,227,248,281,318,319,320,333,334,338,400,402,407,459,484,577,585,630,647,649,652,815,864,892,934,1014,1023,1132,1166,1248,1371,1374,1443,1497,1498,1607,1998,2314,2450,2466,2631,2782,2960,3074,4216,4329,4598,4790,4805,5034,5960,7118],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,10,11,14,16,24,34,35,40,46,47,70,78,92,93,96,127,128,140,152,177,192,202,227,248,281,318,319,320,333,334,338,400,402,407,459,484,577,585,630,647,649,652,815,864,892,934,1014,1023,1132,1166,1248,1371,1374,1443,1497,1498,1607,1998,2314,2450,2466,2631,2782,2960,3074,4216,4329,4598,4790,4805,5034,5960,7118],"values":[0.6557002054693947,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.3210361566119257,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.6284968758320737,1.655771293751733,1.7064694353107215,2.094675786251684,2.0064197866819473,2.0489535369135887,2.035389827120098,2.0390708128715254,2.4359679371086367,7.0229706123476525,2.317169775997098,2.3131195476980753,2.458149992634611,2.5318267134339894,2.597304642813496,2.6005321873043625,2.689504733779216,2.832333801361687,2.902686292364678,2.9056060024680126,2.938298364153555,2.948928684455311,2.942840385588056,2.9720957437368454,3.130944944345658,3.084424928710765,3.120015873813468,3.2850956241729166,3.291526514503207,7.209236604960712,7.433072437368683,3.558

{"value":"We can start with the wooden acting but this film is a disaster. Having grown up in NY I can tell you that this film is an insult to anyone who is familiar with the community or the people. I'm not even a defender of the culture in any way and found this to be a Hollywoodized piece of trash to fit its own fictional, ridiculous culture presentation and language that anyone who watches Seinfeld knows is inaccurate. This is a colossal waste of time and, even worse, is not exactly interesting since the outcome is obvious and the scenes of confrontation are laughably bad. Who acts this way? Nobody.<br /><br />The writer's name sounds Israeli or something of that nature but it is clear he doesn't have a clue about the subject he is writing about. Looking at his bio, it is shocking he lived in New York and wonder how much real connection he had with the community. Even mediocre films like \"A Stranger Among Us\" are better and more closer to the truth than this dreck. Reading this guy's credits it's no wonder he has written scripts on all C grade films that somehow feature stars. shocking. Perhaps he knows someone because this script is even below par for a bad Dolph Lundgren film.","finished_norm":["we","can","start","with","the","wooden","act","but","thi","film","be","a","disast","have","grow","up","in","ny","i","can","tell","you","that","thi","film","be","a","insult","to","anyon","who","be","familiar","with","the","commun","or","the","peopl","i","be","not","even","a","defend","of","the","cultur","in","ani","wai","and","find","thi","to","be","a","hollywood","piec","of","trash","to","fit","it","own","fiction","ridicul","cultur","present","and","languag","that","anyon","who","watch","seinfeld","know","be","inaccur","thi","be","a","coloss","wast","of","time","and","even","wrong","be","not","exactli","interest","sinc","the","outcom","be","obviou","and","the","scene","of","confront","be","laughabl","bad","who","act","thi","wai","nobodybr","br","the","writer","name","sound","isra","or","someth","of","that","natur","but","it","be","clear","he","doe","not","have","a","clue","about","the","subject","he","be","write","about","look","at","hi","bio","it","be","shock","he","live","in","new","york","and","wonder","how","much","real","connect","he","have","with","the","commun","even","mediocr","film","like","a","strang","among","u","be","well","and","much","close","to","the","truth","than","thi","dreck","read","thi","gui","credit","it","no","wonder","he","have","write","script","on","all","c","grade","film","that","somehow","featur","star","shock","perhap","he","know","someon","becaus","thi","script","be","even","below","par","for","a","bad","dolph","lundgren","film"],"filtered":["start","wooden","act","thi","film","disast","grow","ny","tell","thi","film","insult","anyon","familiar","commun","peopl","even","defend","cultur","ani","wai","find","thi","hollywood","piec","trash","fit","fiction","ridicul","cultur","present","languag","anyon","watch","seinfeld","know","inaccur","thi","coloss","wast","time","even","wrong","exactli","interest","sinc","outcom","obviou","scene","confront","laughabl","bad","act","thi","wai","nobodybr","br","writer","name","sound","isra","someth","natur","clear","doe","clue","subject","write","look","hi","bio","shock","live","new","york","wonder","much","real","connect","commun","even","mediocr","film","like","strang","among","u","well","much","close","truth","thi","dreck","read","thi","gui","credit","wonder","write","script","c","grade","film","somehow","featur","star","shock","perhap","know","someon","becaus","thi","script","even","par","bad","dolph","lundgren","film"],"filtered2":["start","wooden","act","disast","grow","ny","tell","insult","anyon","familiar","commun","peopl","even","defend","cultur","ani","wai","find","hollywood","piec","trash","fit","fiction","ridicul","cultur","present","languag","anyon","watch","seinfeld","know","inaccur","coloss","wast","time","even","wrong","exactli","interest","sinc","outcom","obviou","scene","confront","laughabl","bad","act","wai","nobodybr","writer","name","sound","isra","someth","natur","clear","doe","clue","subject","write","look","bio","shock","live","new","york","wonder","real","connect","commun","even","mediocr","like","strang","among","u","well","close","truth","dreck","read","gui","credit","wonder","write","script","c","grade","somehow","featur","star","shock","perhap","know","someon","becaus","script","even","par","bad","dolph","lundgren"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,8,9,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,25,26,27,33,38,53,55,60,65,71,77,80,87,89,90,100,112,116,139,143,145,158,162,175,178,218,274,287,295,300,305,318,356,383,411,417,456,462,508,549,550,552,561,590,671,676,709,758,767,787,826,827,880,891,916,938,1034,1045,1061,1094,1095,1115,1834,2135,2160,2325,2505,2813,3237,3262,4209,4582,6442,6468,8401],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,8,9,16,18,19,20,21,22,23,25,26,27,33,38,53,55,60,65,71,77,80,87,89,90,100,112,116,139,143,145,158,162,175,178,218,274,287,295,300,305,318,356,383,411,417,456,462,508,549,550,552,561,590,671,676,709,758,767,787,826,827,880,891,916,938,1034,1045,1061,1094,1095,1115,1834,2135,2160,2325,2505,2813,3237,3262,4209,4582,6442,6468,8401],"values":[0.6460382945576578,3.704068422904524,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,2.324031090670098,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,1.3002700588679295,2.803707089537043,1.519311641348122,1.7003182735607676,1.9536997889255368,1.838176641236591,3.8147700134888347,1.9214926742550966,3.8927804517536475,1.9951803900462557,2.115024371522662,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,2.1405462403177813,2.2466628996789315,2.2466628996789315,2.293903584125643

{"value":"Well...now that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his \"House of 1,000 Corpses\" crapfest, I can now rest in peace. Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in \"The House of Seven Corpses,\" but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot (ha!) anyway, to kill the bloody amateurs making a low-rent horror flick in his former abode! In Hell House (sorry, I don't remember the actual name of the residence), a bunch of mysterious, unexplained deaths took place long ago; some, like arthritic Lurch stand-in John Carradine (whose small role provides the film's only worthwhile moments), attribute it to the supernatural; bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum. The result comes across like \"Satan's School for Girls\" (catchy title; made-for-TV production values; intriguing plot) crossed with \"Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things\" (low-rent movie about low-rent movie makers who wake the dead); trouble is, it's nowhere near as entertaining or fun. \"The House of Seven Corpses\" is dead at frame one, and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through

{"value":"Much like Orson Welles thirty years earlier,Mike Sarne was given \"the biggest train set in the world\"to play with,but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe. Despite post - modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract,the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today.How anyone given the resources at Mr Sarne's disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely - guarded secret.Only Michael Cimino ever came close with the political and artistic Armageddon that constitutes \"Heaven's Gate\".Both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least Mr Cimino had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before squandering the studio's largesse,whereas Mr Sarne had only the rather fey \"Joanna\" in his locker.

{"value":"OK, I taped this off TV and missed the very start. The film was about 10 or so seconds into the titles (I assume) so if anything happened before that I missed it.<br /><br />Lots of people say Mark Hammill is in this, I didn't see him. I did recognise Clive Barker, John Landis and obviously Stephen King doing some really awful acting as the graveyard attendant.<br /><br />Alice Krige looks lovely apart from the scenes where she has the cat face or is in full alien make-up.<br /><br />Even with the opening titles it's never really explained very well exactly what Sleepwalkers are or where they come from. From the title sequence I assume they are catlike bipeds who live by extracting life-force from humans. I assume they live a long time and these particular 2 are possibly the last of their kind.<br /><br />Add to this a very large dose of incest (Yes!

{"value":"Take your basic Frankenstein flick, inject some Reanimator (but not the good parts), and you have Doctor Hackenstein. Certainly, this was obviously inspired by aforementioned films but it never materializes as anything special on its own.<br /><br />A scientist accidentally kills his wife, so the whole movie takes place over the course of one night as he attempts to revive his wife. To revive his wife, he decides to chop off body parts from some women that have become stranded and, coincidentally, decide to stay the night at his place.<br /><br />I can't really say the acting is bad, nor is the directing. Everything here is just way too standard. What little attempts there are at humor actually work (check out the scene when Hackenstein keeps hiding behind his deaf assistant because she would undoubtedly be very upset if she saw him clutching a woman and a needle), but that's hardly enough to recommend this film. The music is decent, what blood that's there is decent, and the cast looks quite good. And for half of the time, I was even entertained by this film. But I never felt like this was anything more than a time waster.

{"value":"What could have been an engaging-and emotionally charged character study is totally undermined by the predictable factor. Fox is OK as Nathaniel Ayers, the Julliard trained musician who dreams of playing with the Walt Disney orchestra until his bouts with schizophrenia drive him into the street and ultimately skid row. Looking for a good story to boost his flagging career, reporter Steve Lopez {Robert \"rehab\" Downey } gets to know him and tells his story. Taking every element of the classic \"how we hit the skids\" movies, borrowing very liberally from \"A Beautiful Mind\", taking the bogus \"feel good\" attitude of films like \"Rocky\"-you pick the sequel number-and whipping up too much 1930s style melodrama all that is left on the screen is a burnt out shell of a movie. It is corny, trite, utterly predictable and plays way too often on our sentiments. I hate to say it, but this is the kind of movie that, if you say you hated it, people will give you bad looks. I really wish I could say something positive about this film, but I really can't. The acting redeems it somewhat, but not enough for me to give it more than one star. Strictly made for TV movie stuff.

{"value":"Marvin(Rob Schneider)does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream. But his luck changes when he has a car crush(a very bad one)and is found by a doctor. The doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him. After this moment, he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be. By the time, he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side. In the mean time, he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised. I am not a big fun of Rob Schneider. In fact, this is the his first film I have seen. However, I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser.(See his part in Ally Mcbeal, quite funny actually).There are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat. In such movies, the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent. I am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously.

{"value":"As a South African, it's an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense!<br /><br />Despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original Shaka Zulu mini, this \"addition\" to the series is appalling! The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist, leader and warrior. A man who played a large role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa.<br /><br />The plot of this film, however, is nothing but hogwash, scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer that has failed to impress since the mid-nineties.<br /><br />While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors, what is David Hasselhoff doing here, rescuing drowning slaves with his red buoy and bleached smile?<br /><br />I kept expecting blond, busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits, for no apparent reason. Not that this would've been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line that was probably dreamed up after 10 pints of beer at a fancy dress party, where someone's caveman costume inspired the

{"value":"Evil Breed is a very strange slasher flick that is unfortunately no good.The beginning of the film seems promising but overall it's a disaster.The dialogue is pretty bad but not near as bad as the acting.The acting is brutal and unbearable.Most of the characters deliver there lines horribly and even if that is on purpose the method doesn't work because the characters become annoying.Some of the kills are innovative but it took far too long to get to them.After about a half hour through the movie we get the first death (other than in the beginning)and then almost every other character is smoked within the next five minutes.The movie then turned into sort of a spoof with ridiculous looking characters,unrealistic karate like fights,and a scene in which a man gets his intestines pulled out of his a*sscrack.None of it is funny it's just plain ridiculous.The film then becomes ultra gory and ultra pointless.Most of the characters are clichéd even for slasher standards and are as

{"value":"... and how they bore you right out of your mind! The Crater Lake Monster is one of the classic BAD films from the 70's made with no actors of any note, an embarrassing script, woeful direction, and a tireless desire to fuse \"horror\" with light comedy. This movie introduces a paleontologist who finds drawings of an aquatic dinosaur underneath Crater Lake...a meteor falls from the sky, and an aquatic dinosaur of the claymation variety begins to terrorize and eat the inhabitants surrounding Crater Lake. The whole matter is taken care of by Steve our local sheriff. Much of the film - when not showing pools of blood left behind from what we imagine must have been the beast dining - is spent following the bumbling antic of two guys named Arnie and Mitch who run a boat rental place. They try so bad to be funny, that we get lines like, looking at a business sign, Mitch saying to Arnie \"You spelled bait wrong, it's spelled B-A-T-E.\" The laughs were rather scarce here. We then see them get drunk together and imagine a tree trunk to be the dinosaur. Laurel and Hardy watch out! The dinosaur looks fake, but the movie is fun in a bad way.

{"value":"After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. But there was actually no need for a second one. First of all, if Cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again. Just make her break away from jail and that's a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It's supposed to have only one original puppy returning. I'd expected that it should be Lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too. However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that thinks he's a dog (clever). Gerard Depardieu's part was pointless. At the end, Cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be true. She gets baked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. That just didn't work. It was too much over the top, and not too funny.

{"value":"Here's the good news first. \"Spirit\" is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release. The artwork and effects are revolutionary, and I recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone.<br /><br />And now for the bad news. I really mean it when I say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it. You may remember that \"Spirit\" got badly trounced by \"Lilo and Stitch\" last summer. The first person who argues that it was because Disney is more well-established and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled \"Why 'Lilo and Stitch''s Script Didn't Stink\".<br /><br />For all the incredible new animation technology on display in \"Spirit\", the story is almost *astonishingly* dull. There is a lesson here, and (needless to say) it doesn't just apply to animated movies. You can have the most mind-blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we don't care about your characters, it's bad film-making. Simple as that.

{"value":"Yes there are worse movies out there. Most of them made for fun, on a shoe string budget, or as a t.v. movie of the week, but even if this was the 'movie of the week' it would rate no more than two stars. It is a poor movie about a serious subject featuring an abused woman who flees the king of the slime people in to the protective arms of the king of the wussy people. ( If this is an attempt to show that she doesn't need a man to protect her than wuss man is superfluouse to the film and ought not to be in it at all). It has no suspense, no character development, and an heroine that could be outsmarted by a rotton onion. ( I think she flushes her wedding ring on a boat with a self contained tank rather than just dropping it overboard in the ocean (where her body should be anyway) and after the husband finds her, demonstrating that she is a moron, she still makes childish assumptions that lead to almost getting her killed.) I am always amazed when I see the sort of generally high rating a movie like this gets and it makes me realize that Dr. Seuss still has a huge untapped market of people who would be challenged by his work.

{"value":"\"After World War I, an expedition representing the Allied countries is sent to Cambodia to stop the efforts of Count Mazovia in creating a zombie like army of soldiers and laborers. Hoping to prevent a possible outbreak of war due to Mazovia's actions, the group presses through the jungle to Angkor Wat in spite of the perils. The group includes Armand who has his own agenda contrary to the group's wishes,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. <br /><br />Heads up! the zombie make-up department revolted before the cameras started to roll. <br /><br />Also, this \"Revolt of the Zombies\" has little to do with its supposed predecessor \"White Zombie\" (1932) *****, which starred Bela Lugosi. If that film's zombies didn't thrill you, this one's certainly won't. A younger-than-usual Dean Jagger (as Armand Louque) stars as a man obsessive with blonde Dorothy Stone (as Claire Duval). A couple supporting performances are good: devilish Roy D'Arcy (as Mazovia) and subservient Teru Shimada (as Buna); however, neither are given enough material to really pull this one out of the

{"value":"Garson Kanin wrote and directed this look at \"modern day\" Las Vegas and the gap between generations, his first directorial effort since the 1940s! David Janssen is somewhat miscast as a big-shot casino owner who reunites with his son (Robert Drivas, who looks disconcertingly like an older Jason Bateman). Janssen approaches every scene the same way: defensively, with a chip on his shoulder. Playing this role cool and laid-back is asking too much from Janssen, who barks at everyone like a grouchy put-upon husband (he even chews out Don Rickles and makes him cry!). His son, a ne'er-do-well in search of his own identity, makes hip comments about how young people look down on Vegas (give them another ten years), and his disapproval of Dad's lifestyle causes friction. Brenda Vaccaro is cute as a self-conscious secretary and Edy Willaims has a fun bit as a showgirl at an audition. Unfortunately, \"Where It's At\" doesn't have much else going for it other than the now-dated ruminations on ethics between adults and their kids, some quick T&A shots and amusingly jaded satirical bits on the high-stakes world of gambling--most of which has been covered by now, ad nauseum. ** from

{"value":"Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE- Guess what? It worked, I'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this. Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true. Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us! It was by far the worst movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the crappy ones, but got sucked into this one. We have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been revoked. There is nothing remotely funny about this movie...even the \"adventures of dickman\" scene was sophomoric at best.. Color me p***ed. Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason...no..it just sucked. NEVER WATCH THIS! for any reason whatsoever. Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny. That's saying ALOT. Please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity- never view this movie. It's many things- stupid, pointless, and worthless to name a few. But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it failed miserably.

{"value":"Okay first of all, I didn't sit down to watch the premier of a \"Star Trek\" Series to see a cowboy flying around in space. this is how a normal Enterprise episode works<br /><br />1 Archer finds a nebula or something aloung the lines of that and wants to take a closer look but it might destroy the ship.<br /><br />2 he sends a shuttle into the nebula and and the shuttle get damaged...<br /><br />in all of the episodes I have seen, all of the problems are happening because of Archer's stupid mistakes. Oh and did you see the preview of one episode showing Archer and T'pol kissing?!?!?!?!?!?!? I was planning to watch that episode but after that I totally gave up on Enterprise and turned to TV right off. Come on!!!! This is star trek!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Also what was with the banana slug?? In one episode, Hoshi had a banana slug but had to leave it behind for some stupid reason.

{"value":"**** SPOILER WARNING ****<br /><br />Absolutely without a doubt, one of the funniest comedies ever created for the screen. Totally impossible to take any of this seriously. It would take a major novel to list all of the comedy routines in it. During the glory days of her program, Carol Burnett and company, who often did take-offs on films, skewered this one in ways that were hard to imagine. Carol played Jenny who suddenly became ill with only a slight cough and immediately the treacly music came up and everyone looked around wondering where it was coming from. Harvey Korman played Oliver with flowing locks and almost look liked Ryan O'Neal. The only thing funnier than this bit, is the real film.<br /><br />What a death scene at the end. Jenny really looks like she's dying alright...dying for her make-up artist to come in and give her a little color. And of course, we all know how often hospitals encourage a loved one to get in bed with them during the patient's final moments. The ending scene with Ryan O'Neal sitting on a bench in the snow contemplating his future in the movie business is an instant classic. He had plenty to worry about.

{"value":"I've read comments that you shouldn't watch this film if you're looking for stirring Shakespearian dialogue. This is true, unfortunately, because all the stirring dialogue, this wonderful play contains, has been cut, and replaced with songs. I've read this play, and recently was lucky enough to see it performed, at it remains one of my favourite Shakespearian Comedies, but this movie seems to take all that I like about it away. The Princess, though no doubt doing what she was directed to do, had no regal bearing, and all the girls seemed to lose the cleverness of their characters - also affected by unwise cuts, which not only took away the female characters already sparse dialogue, but took comments out of context - it was a little unnerving to hear the Princess proclaim; \"We are wise girls to mock our lovers so!\", when mocking had not taken place at all. The news reels throughout the film also disrupted the flow, and took away many excellent scenes, as they showed the information in the scenes after them, and were in modern phrasing. In conclusion, an excellent play, ruined by an odd concept, and unwise cuts. Kenneth, I usually love what you do.

{"value":"you must be seeing my comments over many films under Evren Buyruk ..I am off to make another comment over a movie that is not even worth a minute of talking though..This film is basically two hours of Dafoe's character drinking himself - nearly literally - to death. The only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised. It was just a grim, sad waste of time.<br /><br />Willem Dafoe is excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this film just sucked. Slow doesn't make the movie bad, it was just bad. The sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren't cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives, finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, it put me to sleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to re-watch the film - which was even more disappointing.) I generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others, even when they suck, but this film warranted one.

{"value":"The stranger Jack (Matthew Lillard) arrives in the studio of the crook collector of antiques Max (Vincent D'Onofrio) and tells his ambitious companion and specialist in poisons Jamie (Valeria Golino) that he is Jack's brother. Jamie does not buy his story, dominates Jack and ties him up to a chair. When Max arrives, Jack proposes US$ 100,000.00 for each one to protect him in a negotiation of the antiques \"Spanish Judges\" with a wealthy and dangerous collector. Max invites his stupid acquaintance Piece (Mark Boone Junior), who comes with his retarded girlfriend that believes she is from Mars, to compose the backup team. However, Jack double-crosses the collector and then he intrigues Jack, Jamie and Piece.<br /><br />The low budget \"Spanish Judges\" is a movie with a reasonable screenplay with an awful conclusion that wastes a good cast. Valeria Golino is astonishingly beautiful but together with the good actor Vincent D'Onofrio, they are not able to save the stupid story. Further, the scenes that are supposed to be funny unfortunately do not work, and actually they are silly and not funny.

{"value":"OK, I bought this film from Woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday, because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it.<br /><br />But we decided it to watch it anyway. Just for hilarity purposes.<br /><br />And I'm sorry, but this has got to be, one of THE worst films in history.<br /><br />It began off alright, and we thought \"Ok this might actually be OK\". But after about 10 minutes, we were sadly mistaken.<br /><br />It began when the \"mysterious paint baller\" turned out to be the most obvious character, the Scouser/Australian (I say that because he had an accent which couldn't be identified), who's acting might I just say, was abysmal.<br /><br />Then it got to the end, and by that time, we had all lost the will to live. The paint ball finals.<br /><br />The only thing I did like about this plot is that they didn't actually win, but annoyingly enough they won by default.<br /><br />And I know this has nothing to do with it, but the name the team were given was just awful. Critical Damage. I mean they could of picked a more awesome name, like \"The Destroyers of the Anti-Christ\" or something.

{"value":"If you watched this movie you know why I said \"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus\". Hehehe!!! Every time they said \"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus\"... I laughed thinking \"Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why did I rent this movie\"? I cannot believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. WTF is Timberlake? Dreaful acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson could have done a much better job! This job was perfect for Joshua Jackson and believe me I am not a big fun of him... but I really prefer an actor, not this android called Timberlake. And his girlfriend was shallow, hollow and annoying as hell. I was happy when they both were popped in the street.<br /><br />The story was OK and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role very well. The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake ruined it all. It would have been much enjoyable without him.<br /><br />By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes, low motion and things like that. Something misplaced for this cops movie I thought.

{"value":"Alone In The Dark is one BAD movie and tied with Deuce Bigalow for worst movie of the year. I wish that was ALL I had to say but of course the IMDb stipulates a word count and all that.<br /><br />I'm in two minds about what kind of bad movie is a worse kind of bad movie. A low budget dreck like Red Zone Cuba, Monster A Go Go and Manos. Or a huge budget disgrace like Gigli, Superbabies or this guff. You see movies like Monster A Go Go and Manos happen because the director hasn't a clue. Movies like this happen because the director is a stupid, money grabbing idiot who simply doesn't care about his audience.<br /><br />It's more shocking when you consider that Uwe Boll (The mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt) has created something that only happens once in a blue moon. The really terribly bad horror film. Everything about it is a mess. Cheesy CGI, bad plot, insane random camera cuts and appalling soundtrack.<br /><br />Alone In The Dark is a dreadful movie that should be watched by absolutely nobody. Woo hoo! Review over.

{"value":"Patrick Channing (Jeff Kober) is a disciple of Satan / serial killer who possesses the \"First Power\": even after being captured by detective Russell Logan (Lou Diamond Phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will. With the help of attractive psychic Tess Seaton (Tracy Griffith, Melanie G.'s half-sister) he attempts to stop Channing.<br /><br />This concept probably had some possibilities, I think, but ultimately \"The First Power\" suffers from routine scripting and film-making. This is nothing we haven't seen before, sometimes done better. There is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers. More to the point, it's not very thrilling and it certainly isn't scary. Phillips is a hard sell as a tough-as-nails, cynical cop stereotype, and Griffith doesn't seem to be trying very hard; best cast member is probably the distinctively featured Kober, doing his best to be supremely creepy.<br /><br />The climax is rather silly and the ending very weak.<br /><br />Not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind, therefore:<br /><br

{"value":"The actors did a really good job playing their roles--particularly the mom. However, as the movie progressed I found I was watching it more for their acting and not because I cared in the least for the people. And, at times, I felt irritated by the irresponsible and hands-off approach to parenting displayed again and again. The daughter is a 17 year-old shallow skank whose main ambition in life is bedding famous men and becoming a dancing nyphette (complete with lots of \"booty shaking\"). The son is a guy with low self-esteem that seems very desperate for a relationship and friends--so much that he throws a drug party late in the film. The husband and wife are both bored, but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners (though the wife picks poorly, as the man she \"throws herself at\" happens to be gay---OOPS!). I just felt that ALL the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow jerks. I think the author's attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and hollowness of the capitalist system. However, given that these characters are NOT typical of the average western family, it seems disingenuous.","finished_norm":["the","actor","do","a","realli","good","job","plai","their","rolesparticularli","the","mom","howev","a","the","movi","progress","i","find","i","be","watch","it","much","for","their","act","and","not","becaus","i","care","in","the","littl","for","the","peopl","and","at","time","i","feel","irrit","by","the","irrespons","and","handsoff","approach","to","parent","displai","again","and","again","the","daughter","be","a","yearold","shallow","skank","whose","main","ambit","in","life","be","bed","famou","man","and","becom","a","danc","nyphett","complet","with","lot","of","booti","shake","the","son","be","a","gui","with","low","selfesteem","that","seem","veri","desper","for","a","relationship","and","friendsso","much","that","he","throw","a","drug","parti","late","in","the","film","the","husband","and","wife","be","both","bore","but","rather","than","put","energi","into","their","stale","relationship","would","rather","seek","out","new","partner","though","the","wife","pick","poorli","a","the","man","she","throw","herself","at","happen","to","be","gayoop","i","just","feel","that","all","the","charact","ne","to","grow","up","and","have","a","hard","time","care","for","such","shallow","jerk","i","think","the","author","attempt","be","to","demonstr","the","utter","banal","and","hollow","of","the","capitalist","system","howev","give","that","thi","charact","be","not","typic","of","the","averag","western","famili","it","seem","disingenu"],"filtered":["actor","realli","good","job","plai","rolesparticularli","mom","howev","movi","progress","find","watch","much","act","becaus","care","littl","peopl","time","feel","irrit","irrespons","handsoff","approach","parent","displai","daughter","yearold","shallow","skank","whose","main","ambit","life","bed","famou","man","becom","danc","nyphett","complet","lot","booti","shake","son","gui","low","selfesteem","seem","veri","desper","relationship","friendsso","much","throw","drug","parti","late","film","husband","wife","bore","rather","put","energi","stale","relationship","rather","seek","new","partner","though","wife","pick","poorli","man","throw","happen","gayoop","feel","charact","ne","grow","hard","time","care","shallow","jerk","think","author","attempt","demonstr","utter","banal","hollow","capitalist","system","howev","give","thi","charact","typic","averag","western","famili","seem","disingenu"],"filtered2":["actor","realli","good","job","plai","rolesparticularli","mom","howev","progress","find","watch","act","becaus","care","littl","peopl","time","feel","irrit","irrespons","handsoff","approach","parent","displai","daughter","yearold","shallow","skank","whose","main","ambit","life","bed","famou","man","becom","danc","nyphett","complet","lot","booti","shake","son","gui","low","selfesteem","seem","veri","desper","relationship","friendsso","throw","drug","parti","late","husband","wife","bore","rather","put","energi","stale","relationship","rather","seek","new","partner","though","wife","pick","poorli","man","throw","happen","gayoop","feel","charact","ne","grow","hard","time","care","shallow","jerk","think","author","attempt","demonstr","utter","banal","hollow","capitalist","system","howev","give","charact","typic","averag","western","famili","seem","disingenu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,8,10,12,13,14,15,21,22,23,30,35,38,40,41,43,45,55,72,75,86,87,94,103,108,110,113,115,150,159,160,171,177,179,182,205,217,263,289,310,398,426,434,446,492,536,561,577,598,613,643,670,697,769,788,850,865,958,1024,1063,1065,1078,1111,1121,1150,1238,1354,1374,1504,1514,1642,1645,1817,1918,2316,2675,2877,3293,5044,5154,7789],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,8,10,12,13,14,15,21,22,23,30,35,38,40,41,43,45,55,72,75,86,87,94,103,108,110,113,115,150,159,160,171,177,179,182,205,217,263,289,310,398,426,434,446,492,536,561,577,598,613,643,670,697,769,788,850,865,958,1024,1063,1065,1078,1111,1121,1150,1238,1354,1374,1504,1514,1642,1645,1817,1918,2316,2675,2877,3293,5044,5154,7789],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,2.247774048205673,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3364419891718522,2.926338025798268,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,3.321622407243643,3.632592212924433,1.9536997889255368,1.9209463754160525,1.9742250248702675,2.031112399272319,2.115024371522662,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,2.138507503627933,2.1290479736304078,4.3043565130405606,2.201553588425805,2.332712011146513,2.300267965194495,4.744459106360251,2.373087554090762,2.458149992634611,2.5079687

{"value":"speaking solely as a movie, i didn't really liked it. not because there were no FX or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole film, actually that was what kept me watching it.<br /><br />i didn't like it because the acting was shady, his \"friends\" are all happy and then they're mad, but you have no idea why; then they take distinct roles, one is the believer, other is the antagonist, but they never really make the point! also, the lighting was terrible and i'm just mentioning technical issues.<br /><br />in a few words, i thing the movie could have just had a \"ok i'm outta here!\" from some characters. like the lady who doesn't want to hear his version of the bible.<br /><br />about the story itself, everyone is free to write about what they want, and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination. i credit the book author for that, hence, my 4/10.<br /><br />so, in the end, hear the man's story believe it or not, just don't spend the

{"value":"Genie (Zoe Trilling) arrives in Egypt to visit her hypocritical, bible-quoting archeologist father (William Finley) and attracts the attention of a group of cultists led by a descendant of the Marquis de Sade (Robert Englund). Englund also plays de Sade in flashbacks, ranting in his cell. Genie is led astray by Mohammed (Juliano Merr), who rides around naked on a horse and Sabina (Alona Kamhi), a bisexual who introduces her to opium smoking, which leads to a wild hallucination featuring topless harem dancers, a woman simulating oral sex on a snake, an orgy and her father preaching in the background! Meanwhile, black hooded cult members decapitate, gouge out eyeballs and slit throats. When Genie is slipped drugs in her tea, she imagines de Sade hanging from a cross, a gold-painted woman in a leafy g-string and herself bloody on a bed covered in snakes. It's all because she's the reincarnation of de Sade's lost love.<br /><br />This typically sleazy Harry Alan Towers production is redundant, seedy and pretty senseless, but the sets, costumes,

{"value":"You probably heard this phrase when it come to this movie  \"Herbie: Fully Loaded with crap\" and yes it is true. This movie is really dreadful and totally lame.<br /><br />This got to be the second worst movie Lindsey is ever in since Confession of the Teenage Drama Queen. The only good thing about this movie seem to be the over talent cast which by far is better than the movie million times and is the only selling point of the movie. I don't see how such a respected actor like Matt Dillon could be a part of this movie, isn't he read that horrible screenplay before he sign on to be in it? <br /><br />What I didn't like about this movie is also base on how Herbie is surreal and fantasy like extraordinary ability and climb on wall and go faster than a racer car after all it just a Beatle. I know it is a kids movie but they have gone overboard with it and it just turn out more silly than entertaining. Little realism is needed plus the story is way too predictable.<br /><br />Final Words: Unless the kids are actually 5 -12 years I highly doubt that any one could enjoy this senseless movie.

{"value":"Ok, first of all, I am a huge zombie movie fan. I loved all of Romero's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re-make of Dawn of the Dead. So when I had heard every single critic railing this movie I was still optimistic. I mean, critics hated Resident Evil, and while it may not be a particularly great film, I enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em up with a half decent plot. This however, is pure crap. Terrible dialogue, half-assed plot, and video game scenes inserted into the film. Who in their right mind thought that was a good idea. The only thing about this movie (I use the term loosely) that I enjoyed was Jurgen Prochnow as Captain Kirk (Ugh). While his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it. Everyone else acts as if they're doing Shakespeare. And very badly I might add. Basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a.)
