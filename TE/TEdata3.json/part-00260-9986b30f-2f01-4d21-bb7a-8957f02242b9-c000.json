{"value":"This film seems to be a rip off of many movies that have dealt with the same subject in the past. Let the future viewer be forewarned that \"Art Heist\" doesn't add anything to the genre. Director Bryan Goeres has no clue what to do with the film.<br /><br />William Baldwin keeps reappearing in films, and frankly, one wonders if he has a great agent, or is it that directors and producers love his unusual goofy looks, complimented by that strange hairdo he sports in most of his movies. The only good movie in which he has appeared, is \"The Squid and the Whale\", in which he only speaks two, or three lines. Ellen Pompeo, his leading lady, doesn't fare much better; there is no chemistry between Ms. Pompeo and Mr. Baldwin.<br /><br />A movie to be seen at the viewer's own risk.","finished_norm":["thi","film","seem","to","be","a","rip","off","of","mani","movi","that","have","deal","with","the","same","subject","in","the","past","let","the","futur","viewer","be","forewarn","that","art","heist","doe","not","add","anyth","to","the","genr","director","bryan","goer","have","no","clue","what","to","do","with","the","filmbr","br","william","baldwin","keep","reappear","in","film","and","frankli","on","wonder","if","he","have","a","great","agent","or","be","it","that","director","and","produc","love","hi","unusu","goofi","look","complim","by","that","strang","hairdo","he","sport","in","much","of","hi","movi","the","onli","good","movi","in","which","he","have","appear","be","the","squid","and","the","whale","in","which","he","onli","speak","two","or","three","line","ellen","pompeo","hi","lead","ladi","doe","not","fare","much","well","there","be","no","chemistri","between","m","pompeo","and","mr","baldwinbr","br","a","movi","to","be","see","at","the","viewer","own","risk"],"filtered":["thi","film","seem","rip","mani","movi","deal","subject","past","let","futur","viewer","forewarn","art","heist","doe","add","anyth","genr","director","bryan","goer","clue","filmbr","br","william","baldwin","keep","reappear","film","frankli","wonder","great","agent","director","produc","love","hi","unusu","goofi","look","complim","strang","hairdo","sport","much","hi","movi","onli","good","movi","appear","squid","whale","onli","speak","two","three","line","ellen","pompeo","hi","lead","ladi","doe","fare","much","well","chemistri","m","pompeo","mr","baldwinbr","br","movi","see","viewer","risk"],"filtered2":["seem","rip","mani","deal","subject","past","let","futur","viewer","forewarn","art","heist","doe","add","anyth","genr","director","bryan","goer","clue","filmbr","william","baldwin","keep","reappear","frankli","wonder","great","agent","director","produc","love","unusu","goofi","look","complim","strang","hairdo","sport","onli","good","appear","squid","whale","onli","speak","two","three","line","ellen","pompeo","lead","ladi","doe","fare","well","chemistri","m","pompeo","mr","baldwinbr","see","viewer","risk"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,11,16,18,20,35,47,50,51,54,58,104,107,124,134,157,169,175,224,261,279,299,344,357,382,417,440,467,468,472,550,566,719,824,844,1038,1069,1132,1221,1332,1676,1774,1928,1987,1993,2060,2528,3324,3837,4362,5725,5938,6564,6620,8200],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,11,16,18,20,35,47,50,51,54,58,104,107,124,134,157,169,175,224,261,279,299,344,357,382,417,440,467,468,472,550,566,719,824,844,1038,1069,1132,1221,1332,1676,1774,1928,1987,1993,2060,2528,3324,3837,4362,5725,5938,6564,6620,8200],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.982619630677639,1.1966138720291084,2.430631986809635,1.165345040023057,1.463169012899134,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,3.731402629253362,2.0728240170322856,2.1439533986393955,2.2323930368088845,2.2443961816702407,2.3360150694757706,2.4214486257841834,2.3791142619576227,2.689504733779216,2.7085302779237206,5.5821542374466135,2.7949961309240425,2.983093497946387,3.2829611516442836,3.235085203598255,3.1932880749197934,3.212973749990824,3.342254038012865,3.304513710030018,3.4222967456864013,3.4751392270607813,3.439602492783994,3.857614816944247,3.8767358583910254,3.8690435127678695,4.165705761027235,4.2860694432771105,4.218628162481577,4.470719289830655,4.383707912841026,4.770124825978496,4.760735085628657,4.848596441419991,4.869215728622727,6.032366538428407,4.979216623837056,5.501738287366237,5.999576715605417,5.9370563586240825,5.9370563586240825,6.389041482367141,6.489124940924123,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.0723970715468207E-5,6.031449478482833E-5,6.078338246894542E-5,6.0432175437492794E-5,6.04331655506483E-5,6.0348692062062516E-5,6.052817752788936E-5,6.0323179677970634E-5,6.0458808176293895E-5,6.707574735529861E-5,0.5925675555920799,6.022580476617834E-5,6.13498895463387E-5,6.22250592014983E-5,6.026972079474428E-5,6.010316129040362E-5,0.04686495807308825,6.0533848561237876E-5,6.034604253188955E-5,6.0396058671804823E-5,6.098042596245516E-5,6.0593822287222106E-5,6.066281754636845E-5,6.072817492838682E-5,0.025692691649436973,6.0874203863716897E-5,0.07283490292289516,6.024370934572711E-5,6.024532100603549E-5,6.0397952186116044E-5,6.16816965205183E-5,0.054612444489768715,6.497419358616526E-5,6.070060405900351E-5,6.030928191411917E-5,6.0587649006440794E-5,6.024885050652329E-5,6.02844531443823E-5,6.0102859327261755E-5,6.011845278186482E-5,6.025377211270072E-5,0.08700135152775841,6.0579917503081916E-5,6.034040144372596E-5,6.107360059204209E-5,6.036356041952865E-5,6.236914177852

{"value":"I watched this film because I noticed that it had Kari Wuhrer in the cast. I have long had a theory about her, that she is a talented actress, but never seems to get to prove that, because she is always in this sort of low-budget B movie. She is still beautiful, and she is still trying to act over the unfortunate material I always see her in. This is no different. The film is often ugly and disturbing, but that doesn't make it good. George Wendt played against type, and that was so jarring that he gets recognition for his role. Another note about Ms. Wuhrer. Her breasts seem to have shrunk markedly since I saw her last. Perhaps reduction surgery, or (more likely) removal of implants. This NOT a bad thing. She still looks great.

{"value":"And so the great rewriting of history continues Hollywood style.<br /><br />This was senseless ridiculous rubbish.<br /><br />Its shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most contrived, poorly acted inaccurate film I have ever seen. It is appalling.<br /><br />Nic Cage's brief flirtation with serious acting appears to be over. I can only assume that Leaving Las Vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of dreadful films.<br /><br />Diane Kruger proves that her performance in Troy was no fluke, she really can't act.<br /><br

{"value":"This movie is a bad memory from my childhood. This is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you can't go out for recess, and you'd rather be watching anything, ANYTHING else. At least that's what it was like when I was in elementary school. I just remember HATING this movie. Granted, I haven't seen it in 15 years or so, and they probably don't use it on rainy days anymore but I just want to warn everyone: You'd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them. Trust me, pick anything else. Even though the topic is kind of controversial, the plot is so tame and slow that I can't remember anything about it except that I disliked it so strongly that here, 15 years later, I felt the need to warn all of you against it.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","a","bad","memori","from","my","childhood","thi","be","on","of","that","movi","that","thei","show","kid","on","a","raini","dai","at","school","when","you","ca","not","go","out","for","recess","and","you","have","rather","be","watch","anyth","anyth","els","at","littl","that","what","it","be","like","when","i","be","in","elementari","school","i","just","rememb","hate","thi","movi","grant","i","have","not","see","it","in","year","or","so","and","thei","probabl","do","not","us","it","on","raini","dai","anymor","but","i","just","want","to","warn","everyon","you","have","be","well","off","us","thi","to","put","your","kid","to","sleep","than","entertain","them","trust","me","pick","anyth","els","even","though","the","topic","be","kind","of","controversi","the","plot","be","so","tame","and","slow","that","i","ca","not","rememb","anyth","about","it","except","that","i","dislik","it","so","strongli","that","here","year","late","i","feel","the","ne","to","warn","all","of","you","against","it"],"filtered":["thi","movi","bad","memori","childhood","thi","movi","thei","show","kid","raini","dai","school","ca","go","recess","rather","watch","anyth","anyth","els","littl","like","elementari","school","rememb","hate","thi","movi","grant","see","year","thei","probabl","us","raini","dai","anymor","want","warn","everyon","well","us","thi","put","kid","sleep","entertain","trust","pick","anyth","els","even","though","topic","kind","controversi","plot","tame","slow","ca","rememb","anyth","except","dislik","strongli","year","late","feel","ne","warn"],"filtered2":["bad","memori","childhood","show","kid","raini","dai","school","ca","go","recess","rather","watch","anyth","anyth","els","littl","like","elementari","school","rememb","hate","grant","see","year","probabl","us","raini","dai","anymor","want","warn","everyon","well","us","put","kid","sleep","entertain","trust","pick","anyth","els","even","though","topic","kind","controversi","plot","tame","slow","ca","rememb","anyth","except","dislik","strongli","year","late","feel","ne","warn"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,7,9,14,20,28,32,37,43,56,57,81,86,104,110,114,122,132,148,150,159,160,195,196,233,246,290,296,339,390,446,527,732,1066,1068,1290,1352,1515,1870,1885,2225,2253,2294,4332,6280],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,7,9,14,20,28,32,37,43,56,57,81,86,104,110,114,122,132,148,150,159,160,195,196,233,246,290,296,339,390,446,527,732,1066,1068,1290,1352,1515,1870,1885,2225,2253,2294,4332,6280],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.6608112036218214,3.7221218701403576,3.668325173349496,3.899514464849456,2.031112399272319,8.291296068129142,2.1290479736304078,4.886614839193365,2.2489347673732487,4.506988091575534,2.3018654096236517,2.332712011146513,2.300267965194495,2.3722295531801256,2.51289241584188,4.957850110419152,2.6102777977348763,2.673149229007135,5.7225627547931115,5.900913137266729,3.003844442051426,3.132778125427319,3.233054746047873,6.879204985567988,3.7099788181381825,4.3095999406873045,4.1554492608600455,4.3336974922663645,4.436351646326448,4.605250182788262,4.848596441419991,4.85885294158718,5.00274712124725,5.185068678041204,5.116075806554253,11.874112717248165,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.323811472675002E-5,7.274425299747402E-5,7.330977019930911E-5,7.288618556610237E-5,7.288737972419219E-5,7.278549773301933E-5,7.300197200146933E-5,0.03561427801231068,7.291830684468183E-5,0.0503474867943205,0.8616699654793676,7.263728552343579E-5,7.399302443711337E-5,7.504855118964212E-5,7.26902518742946E-5,7.248936738100462E-5,7.429752397356531E-5,7.300881173520388E-5,7.278230218120522E-5,7.284262576924047E-5,7.354742089661685E-5,7.308114499293507E-5,7.3164358963389E-5,7.32431853541224E-5,7.380528917325618E-5,0.04679922417860754,7.650571653292888E-5,7.265887992241327E-5,7.266082371760939E-5,7.284490950359986E-5,7.439321100192099E-5,7.300458149800526E-5,7.836423389436691E-5,7.320993261272194E-5,7.273796584565318E-5,7.307369950739164E-5,7.266508058616736E-5,7.27080203024832E-5,7.24890031885619E-5,7.250781018032726E-5,7.26710164489513E-5,7.343754168705081E-5,7.306437467696081E-5,7.277549856383236E-5,7.36597971811534E-5,7.280343019786102E-5,7.522232665560517E-5,7.411616041608407E-5,7.252583233501004E-5,7.268611885972945E-5,7.266090857524697E-5,7.470585967797598E-5,7.268720029060816E-5,7.250137314366624E-5,7.329717947137658E-5,7.270592258381654E-5,7.818722915131935E-5,7.264600345638411E-5,7.252499361536583E-5,7.287127917379397E-5,7.359410101928864E-5,7.286645832417793E-5,7.251157632940835E-5,7.268040842

It was even hard sometimes to understand what they were saying. They just talk to fast and don't open their enough for us to understand. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny \" what, what did he say\", and i'm french. I hate to say that, given the fact that i think good films are made here, but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who will go see the film ( if ever shown outside of France ).<br /><br />We're deeply sorry for that cr@p.

{"value":"I watched this with a growing sense of unease. Why would God, in the shape of Ian Hunter, help these particular people in their attempted escape from Devils Island ? And what was he doing there in the first place ? I mean, I know God works in mysterious ways, but helping thieves and murderers and prostitutes find redemption, forgiveness and changes-of-heart in such a godforsaken location.... In any event it is hardly a likeable movie. Whatever Gable had by way of charm is missing in this portrait of a thoroughly selfish man, Crawford is as endearing as ever she was i.e. to me, not at all, and the whole look of the film makes it seem as if it was made 10 years before.Compared to contemperaneous films like \"Stagecoach\" and \"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\", this looks

{"value":"This is a pretty bad movie. The plot is sentimental mush. I suppose the production values are OK, decent photography, unobtrusive direction and all that. Mark Hamill was terrible. I've never cared much for him, and this movie validates that perception. It's no wonder that he never really had any sort of career aside from his \"Star Wars\" films. I'll just say \"Buh-bye, Mark\" as he sinks into well-deserved obscurity. On the other hand, a very young Annie Potts utterly stole the show. She showed charm, beauty, and acting chops all in one performance. I remember seeing her in \"Texasville\" recently and taking note of her beauty. It's interesting seeing her from ten years earlier. Anyway, unless you are interested in Miss Potts, run away from this film screaming for the hills.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","pretti","bad","movi","the","plot","be","sentiment","mush","i","suppos","the","product","valu","be","okai","decent","photographi","unobtrus","direct","and","all","that","mark","hamil","be","terribl","i","have","never","care","much","for","him","and","thi","movi","valid","that","percept","it","no","wonder","that","he","never","realli","have","ani","sort","of","career","asid","from","hi","star","war","film","i","will","just","sai","buhby","mark","a","he","sink","into","welldeserv","obscur","on","the","other","hand","a","veri","young","anni","pott","utterli","steal","the","show","she","show","charm","beauti","and","act","chop","all","in","on","perform","i","rememb","see","her","in","texasvil","recent","and","take","note","of","her","beauti","it","interest","see","her","from","ten","year","earli","anywai","unless","you","be","interest","in","miss","pott","run","awai","from","thi","film","scream","for","the","hill"],"filtered":["thi","pretti","bad","movi","plot","sentiment","mush","suppos","product","valu","okai","decent","photographi","unobtrus","direct","mark","hamil","terribl","never","care","much","thi","movi","valid","percept","wonder","never","realli","ani","sort","career","asid","hi","star","war","film","sai","buhby","mark","sink","welldeserv","obscur","hand","veri","young","anni","pott","utterli","steal","show","show","charm","beauti","act","chop","perform","rememb","see","texasvil","recent","take","note","beauti","interest","see","ten","year","earli","anywai","unless","interest","miss","pott","run","awai","thi","film","scream","hill"],"filtered2":["pretti","bad","plot","sentiment","mush","suppos","product","valu","okai","decent","photographi","unobtrus","direct","mark","hamil","terribl","never","care","valid","percept","wonder","never","realli","ani","sort","career","asid","star","war","buhby","mark","sink","welldeserv","obscur","hand","veri","young","anni","pott","utterli","steal","show","show","charm","beauti","act","chop","perform","rememb","see","texasvil","recent","take","note","beauti","interest","see","ten","year","earli","anywai","unless","interest","miss","pott","run","awai","scream","hill"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,9,13,15,21,27,28,31,32,42,57,60,78,100,102,105,135,137,149,155,166,175,190,191,205,235,255,266,269,290,309,314,325,386,451,460,511,526,545,560,562,578,717,797,816,936,1018,1357,1371,1863,2085,2482,2633,3846,4776,8382],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,9,13,15,21,27,28,31,32,42,57,60,78,100,102,105,135,137,149,155,166,175,190,191,205,235,255,266,269,290,309,314,325,386,451,460,511,526,545,560,562,578,717,797,816,936,1018,1357,1371,1863,2085,2482,2633,3846,4776,8382],"values":[1.3114004109387893,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,3.0904588387038183,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,3.2439908614907673,1.834162586674748,3.676353282473182,2.0064197866819473,2.1405462403177813,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.366244071437088,2.2939035841256437,2.3253197803590226,2.3074766467914385,2.4423870329693536,2.3791142619576227,2.558331832813986,2.5460113484259455,2.571852579609833,2.6457189377809835,2.6754694156628323,2.747702973022204,2.76533567167316,2.8612813773965557,2.848772527704847,3.189397019426827,5.947318931426056,3.0433232530252132,3.216957819005698,3.216957819005698,3.3909310864081816,3.5119855004467477,3.442099372982581,3.4623020803001006,3.432149042129413,3.575630765607104,7.479663562575727,3.7987743169213135,3.7881170224473255,3.965503778955432,4.268777946167049,4.456830177669989,4.403125998698128,4.8184434032493035,4.944927550358424,5.501738287366237,5.3064295350454715,5.7959777603641776,6.137727054086234,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.844425286163544E-5,6.798271726362932E-5,6.851121806549209E-5,6.811535951763523E-5,6.81164755111116E-5,6.802126229061978E-5,6.822356705533293E-5,6.79925063307029E-5,6.814537827114267E-5,0.2598957614327217,0.7046959247811152,6.788275143479335E-5,6.914974932746595E-5,0.030137324862856293,6.793225082899355E-5,6.774451539770862E-5,6.943431759286883E-5,6.822995908859294E-5,6.801827590631411E-5,6.807465096359692E-5,6.873331313825527E-5,6.829755771262813E-5,6.837532484326249E-5,6.844899158686528E-5,6.897430243183753E-5,6.861358624787121E-5,7.149797106707629E-5,6.790293235438043E-5,6.790474891684125E-5,6.807678521421964E-5,6.952374134699999E-5,6.822600574509732E-5,7.323483762499632E-5,6.84179154313792E-5,6.797684164257311E-5,6.829059957754896E-5,6.79087271485184E-5,6.794885620989981E-5,6.77441750437859E-5,6.776175100822405E-5,6.79142744744545E-5,6.863062616396825E-5,6.8281885111669E-5,6.801191762538922E-5,6.883833373938852E-5,6.803802097102325E-5,7.029858

{"value":"This movie was heavily marred by the presence of Steven Seagal. Or as I should say Steven So-dull! Like before Seagal is either too good or too stupid to re-dub his own lines, leaving someone to impersonate his voice for the shots where the sound needed to be looped. A few films before this was he has done this too, but I don't think to this extent! To be honest the film looks pretty good, the script could use some work but parts of this film looked like a real movie! Of course, all told, this film is pretty bad.<br /><br />It would have been much better without Seagal who has become a cartoon of himself. Don't bother. Anything over a buck for this one is too much! I honestly think this is the last time for me and a Seagal film.

{"value":"I found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible.<br /><br />The only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was Lacy Chabert's performance who I thought played the multiple personalities really well. For me she was definitely the highlight of this movie.<br /><br />Dina Meyer was pretty as always but I found her role pretty bland so I don't think one can say that her acting was great.<br /><br />As for the male lead, Armand Assante, his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital series.<br /><br />All of that I could have lived with. However the terrible, terrible, terrible end/solution, the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing I have seen in a long

{"value":"This Paramount version/ripoff of OKLAHOMA!/ANNIE GET YOUR GUN/CALAMITY JANE isn't all that unusual or innovative. The marketing and intro comments may be there to salvage what is really a pretty bad movie musical western shot on a soundstage and like a live TV show. I don't find the use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or....all that innovative. As noted, it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a TV budget: All soundstage, with minimal sets backed by the lighted cycs! (Compare to NEW FACES (OF 1952). The actors come off reasonably well, though. And this style was much better realized when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959.

{"value":"This was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn't that great. Sure, \"CHAOS\" and \"INSIDE MAN\" are literally the same movie, just with variations in suspense. But I found \"CHAOS\" more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film \"Swordfish.\" The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and \"Chaos\" was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A. <br /><br />It's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, but that doesn't mean that it is a pleasant film to watch. <br /><br />Watch it if nothing else is on T.V., but you'll probably get bored with

{"value":"It begins on a nice note only to falter quickly and let down expectations.<br /><br />Mac (Akshay Kumar) and Sam's (John Abraham) characters are not properly built before Mac's boss decides to hitch him with three air hostess. Rest of the drama is about how Mac, Sam and Uncle Mambo (Paresh Rawal) deal with situations which at times seem forced.<br /><br />About the cast, Paresh Rawal is a very talented actor, I thought was wasted in the role of a moody cook. Akshay Kumar is tolerable, John Abraham is very bad keeps stumbling over furniture & Rajpal Yadav is the only saving grace in the movie. <br /><br />The second half of the movie is funny at times, but

{"value":"Why did the histories of Mary and Rhoda have to be so dour? Divorced women with indifferent daughters. And why very little reference to the original show and characters? The daughter characters were silly and uninteresting. Why can't there ever be daughters who like their mother's on TV? It makes sense that Mary would leave Minneapolis, and Rhoda would return to NYC, but why couldn't Phyllis or Sue Ann Nivens be guest stars? It just seems a pitiful way to remember such wonderful characters. It was good to see Mary and Rhoda together of course, but it could have been better, much better. Well, there has been a Mary Tyler Moore Show Reunion, a Dick Van Dyke Show Reunion, hopefully Mary will do better next time if she revisits her old Mary Richards stomping grounds

{"value":"I don't want to go off on a rant here, but.....this is the worst \"film\" I've ever seen. Worse than The Avengers. Incompetent directing, disjointed writing, and awful acting are the only consistent elements throughout. Shot on very cheap video, it looks like a high school project, but without the emotion. The lighting frequently looks like a single Sun-Gun. The sound is slightly better than a single mic on the camera, but everything else about this thing is just awful. The plot heads off in strange directions with no foundation or later resolution, the techie elements are patently absurd, and the editing looks worse than a rough cut. It's not even bad enough to be funny. It's just bad.

And most important for the action fans: The shoot out is boring. It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. Nothing more. Play Counter Strike, then you will at least have something to do. The only moral of this film is: The LAPD is good now. No more bad cops in it. If you like uncritical, euphemistic commercials for police and military service, watch this movie. It's the longest commercial I've ever seen. (2 Points for camera and editing).","finished_norm":["ye","madsen","charact","whilst","talk","to","the","woman","from","the","tv","station","be","right","the","lapd","be","a","corrupt","violent","and","racist","polic","and","thi","movi","chang","noth","about","it","okai","here","be","the","good","cop","the","moral","cop","even","a","black","on","whow","a","christian","a","martyr","but","thi","be","a","fairi","tale","admit","it","realiti","be","not","like","that","and","much","import","for","the","action","fan","the","shoot","out","be","bore","it","just","shoot","and","shoot","and","shoot","noth","much","plai","counter","strike","then","you","will","at","littl","have","someth","to","do","the","onli","moral","of","thi","film","be","the","lapd","be","good","now","no","much","bad","cop","in","it","if","you","like","uncrit","euphemist","commerci","for","polic","and","militari","servic","watch","thi","movi","it","the","long","commerci","i","have","ever","see","point","for","camera","and","edit"],"filtered":["ye","madsen","charact","whilst","talk","woman","tv","station","right","lapd","corrupt","violent","racist","polic","thi","movi","chang","noth","okai","good","cop","moral","cop","even","black","whow","christian","martyr","thi","fairi","tale","admit","realiti","like","much","import","action","fan","shoot","bore","shoot","shoot","shoot","noth","much","plai","counter","strike","littl","someth","onli","moral","thi","film","lapd","good","much","bad","cop","like","uncrit","euphemist","commerci","polic","militari","servic","watch","thi","movi","long","commerci","ever","see","point","camera","edit"],"filtered2":["ye","madsen","charact","whilst","talk","woman","tv","station","right","lapd","corrupt","violent","racist","polic","chang","noth","okai","good","cop","moral","cop","even","black","whow","christian","martyr","fairi","tale","admit","realiti","like","import","action","fan","shoot","bore","shoot","shoot","shoot","noth","plai","counter","strike","littl","someth","onli","moral","lapd","good","bad","cop","like","uncrit","euphemist","commerci","polic","militari","servic","watch","long","commerci","ever","see","point","camera","edit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,9,10,11,14,40,44,49,53,66,70,99,108,117,121,129,140,172,186,191,209,229,231,278,348,471,476,600,656,684,691,820,878,966,984,1056,1125,1259,1533,1632,1780,1878,2288,3514,5089,7022],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,9,10,11,14,40,44,49,53,66,70,99,108,117,121,129,140,172,186,191,209,229,231,278,348,471,476,600,656,684,691,820,878,966,984,1056,1125,1259,1533,1632,1780,1878,2288,3514,5089,7022],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,3.3840606616174704,1.7003182735607676,1.929723173391612,2.094675786251684,2.056430207256609,2.138507503627933,9.118920474046881,2.2190595059394194,2.4106958340079214,2.317169775997098,2.5001408943598484,2.571852579609833,2.5460113484259455,2.6026896854443837,2.8432628718938773,2.7049353070058615,2.8336934208777267,3.0103169565570433,6.992055430016274,10.831554073822634,3.558633189238533,3.68099128126493,4.1302590120314875,3.5929222627171646,3.900174431363043,8.135175810137424,4.026392148630444,4.263079925052412,4.100845126825194,8.481214138400706,4.390138803171316,4.646072177308517,4.6973654716960676,4.869215728622727,4.9676558014359795,5.5623629091826725,6.101359409915359,6.1754673820690815,13.897314540605125]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.655638580735987E-5,6.610758053824803E-5,6.662150394010598E-5,6.62365641805974E-5,6.623764939212746E-5,6.614506239508878E-5,6.63417870784327E-5,6.611709959788566E-5,6.626575494032322E-5,7.351823780125526E-5,0.7252883105565279,6.601037202192439E-5,6.724242288136327E-5,6.820165081934887E-5,6.60585060965892E-5,6.587594888729991E-5,6.751914202824289E-5,6.634800280311312E-5,6.614215838287874E-5,6.619697847230264E-5,6.683747306433065E-5,6.641373688469377E-5,6.648935899952778E-5,6.656099382646222E-5,6.707181525857637E-5,6.672104854693508E-5,6.9525874676486E-5,6.60299963002798E-5,6.6031762757315E-5,6.619905385484999E-5,6.760609924716859E-5,6.634415850291373E-5,7.121483402503085E-5,6.653077483060113E-5,6.610186698180573E-5,6.640697067272613E-5,6.60356312592164E-5,6.607465345873967E-5,6.587561792120642E-5,6.589270909571959E-5,6.604102557575527E-5,6.673761845868752E-5,6.639849657404052E-5,6.613597547955793E-5,6.693959692943992E-5,0.01910505646891117,6.83595722377202E-5,6.735432480229225E-5,6.590908703614886E-5,6.605475014911606E-5,6.603183987314035E-5,6.789022406364309E-5,6.60557329178705E-5,6.588685932887257E-5,0.060576189883336296,6.60727471211255E-5,7.105397794603483E-5,6.601829459217236E-5,6

{"value":"The idea behind this film was a good one. Too bad it wasn't written well. Casting Sidney Poitier as the FBI agent was a good idea, and he did an outstanding job. Tom Berenger, on the other hand, only knows one emotion in most of his movies, anger. Kirstie Alley's character could have been a great one, and even showed some possibilities once, but the writer really let us down by making her role mostly a helpless female. This was completely inconsistent with the strongly independent character she was supposed to be. I don't care for Alley's acting anyway. The movie should have ended about fifteen minutes sooner than it did. The director milked the cow dry before the unbelievable final action.

{"value":"A lot of horror fans seem to love Scarecrows, so I won't be very popular in saying that I found it to be rather boring. The idea behind it was interesting, but it seems to drag so much. I think the main problem is that it is all set in darkness. Sometimes horror films set in darkness can work (such as Humongous), but Scarecrows is in darkness for the whole film. A lot of the time it's hard to figure out what's actually happening, and although some shots of the scarecrows were creepy, most were hard to even see. If a little more lighting had been used, perhaps it could've been better.<br /><br />There's not many films involving killer scarecrows to my knowledge, apart from Dark Night Of The Scarecrow, which is much better. I would recommend that over Scarecrows any day.","finished_norm":["a","lot","of","horror","fan","seem","to","love","scarecrow","so","i","wo","not","be","veri","popular","in","sai","that","i","find","it","to","be","rather","bore","the","idea","behind","it","be","interest","but","it","seem","to","drag","so","much","i","think","the","main","problem","be","that","it","be","all","set","in","dark","sometim","horror","film","set","in","dark","can","work","such","a","humong","but","scarecrow","be","in","dark","for","the","whole","film","a","lot","of","the","time","it","hard","to","figur","out","what","actual","happen","and","although","some","shot","of","the","scarecrow","be","creepi","much","be","hard","to","even","see","if","a","littl","much","light","have","be","us","perhap","it","can","have","be","betterbr","br","there","not","mani","film","involv","killer","scarecrow","to","my","knowledg","apart","from","dark","night","of","the","scarecrow","which","be","much","well","i","would","recommend","that","over","scarecrow","ani","dai"],"filtered":["lot","horror","fan","seem","love","scarecrow","wo","veri","popular","sai","find","rather","bore","idea","behind","interest","seem","drag","much","think","main","problem","set","dark","sometim","horror","film","set","dark","work","humong","scarecrow","dark","whole","film","lot","time","hard","figur","actual","happen","although","shot","scarecrow","creepi","much","hard","even","see","littl","much","light","us","perhap","betterbr","br","mani","film","involv","killer","scarecrow","knowledg","apart","dark","night","scarecrow","much","well","recommend","scarecrow","ani","dai"],"filtered2":["lot","horror","fan","seem","love","scarecrow","wo","veri","popular","find","rather","bore","idea","behind","interest","seem","drag","think","main","problem","set","dark","sometim","horror","set","dark","work","humong","scarecrow","dark","whole","lot","time","hard","figur","actual","happen","although","shot","scarecrow","creepi","hard","even","see","littl","light","us","perhap","betterbr","mani","involv","killer","scarecrow","knowledg","apart","dark","night","scarecrow","well","recommend","scarecrow","ani","dai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,8,12,14,15,20,27,35,38,48,50,52,54,56,60,72,83,94,108,109,111,123,132,140,160,167,171,179,210,237,241,252,298,318,353,368,393,406,415,441,500,572,755,764,951,1631,1713,2173],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,8,12,14,15,20,27,35,38,48,50,52,54,56,60,72,83,94,108,109,111,123,132,140,160,167,171,179,210,237,241,252,298,318,353,368,393,406,415,441,500,572,755,764,951,1631,1713,2173],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.3002700588679295,2.926338025798268,1.519311641348122,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,1.8113893252729412,1.8610609350701788,1.838176641236591,3.841892750832105,4.584637595480144,2.08112281984698,2.138507503627933,4.251382278653714,2.1183455303375887,2.2619070973220485,2.253494045787767,2.317169775997098,2.3722295531801256,2.4609576687888097,4.746175108181524,2.507968722980095,2.687151791517189,2.640097787510554,2.6627744961815836,3.0433232530252132,2.7819920465008363,2.902686292364678,3.0266839340212486,12.538458692938482,3.120015873813468,3.121829110937649,3.1588018988486244,3.293679367864308,3.3814747511661465,3.4933926673701317,3.79165684915245,3.7465885637507435,4.004218291136122,4.646072177308517,35.9974602936325,4.956227105612356]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.211883469802575E-5,7.163252053564976E-5,7.21893950776857E-5,7.177228398386744E-5,7.177345989193396E-5,7.167313493808287E-5,7.188630088372429E-5,7.164283515054598E-5,7.180391436087544E-5,7.966252336214703E-5,0.619327106344659,7.152718781911259E-5,7.286220730963317E-5,7.390160270735716E-5,7.157934469830584E-5,7.138153027313898E-5,7.316205325483448E-5,7.189303608749653E-5,7.166998822309833E-5,7.172938990062835E-5,7.242341381804996E-5,7.19642638939051E-5,7.204620612578974E-5,7.212382783225167E-5,7.267734115747154E-5,7.229725912345535E-5,7.533649855240009E-5,7.154845219622102E-5,7.155036628487498E-5,7.173163873323927E-5,7.32562779219559E-5,7.188887049996881E-5,7.716661265177359E-5,7.209108328428967E-5,7.162632946881822E-5,7.195693219587933E-5,7.155455809676157E-5,7.159684157599251E-5,7.138117164655945E-5,7.139969121571212E-5,7.156040324321983E-5,7.23152138653203E-5,7.194774987453018E-5,7.166328858373031E-5,7.253407268356974E-5,7.169079334549097E-5,7.407272240576993E-5,7.298346143183307E-5,7.141743794225361E-5,7.157527484758206E-5,7.155044984565422E-5,0.06384212112460641,7.157633975121961E-5,7.139335255469342E-5,7.217699677074016E-5,7.159477591624242E-5,7.699231302852085E-5,7.153577251804366E-5,7.14166120405547E-5,7.17576054022731E-5,7.246938053992982E-5

There is much worse acting as far as B movie go, but don't think for a second this was anything stellar, hell no. It actually did have a plot with substance, but was still pretty stupid. Basically its just a bad low budget horror movie. But at least its not as bad as titanic, that movie sucks balls, this one just sucks. The blood looks really fake in this movie. Thats one complaint I have about all the horror of the new millinium, low grade gore, looks stupid. A good gruesome death scene with really fake blood is so stupid.

{"value":"This could have been the gay counterpart to Gone With The Wind given its epic lenght, but instead it satisfied itself by being a huge chain of empty episodes in which absolutely nothing occurs. The characters are uni-dimensional and have no other development in the story (there's actually no story either) than looking for each other and kissing. It's a shame that an interesting aesthetic proposition like having almost no dialog is completely wasted in a film than makes no effort in examining the psychology of its characters with some dignity, and achieving true emotional resonance. On top of that, it pretends to be an \"art\" film by using the worst naive clichés of the cinematic snobbery.

{"value":"I just saw this movie last night and, being someone who had very low expectations to begin with, was still disappointed. The most glaring error in this abomination of a movie is that the main plot point (the guy being awake during the surgery), had NOTHING to do with the outcome. It would have ended the same way regardless. So, what was the point of this? Who knows. Also, this surgeon had 4 malpractice suits against him and he didn't think people would ask questions if a patient died on his table? Give me a break. Jessica Alba is completely talentless and Christiansen is almost as bad. The whole thing was just laughable from start to finish.

I hate it how they create low budget sequels featuring D-Lister actors and a storyline so similar to the 1st one.<br /><br />I found this movie in the bargain bin sitting right next to Wild Things 2 and Death To The Supermodels for $2.99 what a fool i was to actually think that this could be good instead i watched in disgust as poor acting stereotypes ripped of the storyline and script from the 1st one.<br /><br />Whoever thought that this straight-to-video production was actually even a half decent film you must be on crackd or something because I think what pretty much most of the people

{"value":"Many people here say that this show is for kids only. Hm, when I was a kid (approximately 7-9 years old) I watched this show first. It was disgusting for me. I talked with other kids about this and, sure, other shows and know what? This was the measure of disguise, whenever we wanted to emphasize something's silliness (either on TV or anything else) we said \"Uh, just like Power Rangers\" and laughed. <br /><br />And before visiting this site I could not imagine that there actually are fans of MMPR. It was so strange for me that I decided to watch it again and try to understand why people like it. I did not enjoy that viewing. But it dawned upon me: maybe I have not enough imagination? It may be. However this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star.","finished_norm":["mani","peopl","here","sai","that","thi","show","be","for","kid","onli","hm","when","i","be","a","kid","approxim","year","old","i","watch","thi","show","it","be","disgust","for","me","i","talk","with","other","kid","about","thi","and","sure","other","show","and","know","what","thi","be","the","measur","of","disguis","whenev","we","want","to","emphas","someth","silli","either","on","tv","or","anyth","els","we","sai","uh","just","like","power","ranger","and","laugh","br","br","and","befor","visit","thi","site","i","can","not","imagin","that","there","actual","be","fan","of","mmpr","it","be","so","strang","for","me","that","i","decid","to","watch","it","again","and","try","to","understand","why","peopl","like","it","i","do","not","enjoi","that","view","but","it","dawn","upon","me","mayb","i","have","not","enough","imagin","it","mai","be","howev","thi","argum","be","not","suffici","for","me","to","rate","it","much","than","star"],"filtered":["mani","peopl","sai","thi","show","kid","onli","hm","kid","approxim","year","old","watch","thi","show","disgust","talk","kid","thi","sure","show","know","thi","measur","disguis","whenev","want","emphas","someth","silli","either","tv","anyth","els","sai","uh","like","power","ranger","laugh","br","br","befor","visit","thi","site","imagin","actual","fan","mmpr","strang","decid","watch","try","understand","peopl","like","enjoi","view","dawn","upon","mayb","enough","imagin","mai","howev","thi","argum","suffici","rate","much","star"],"filtered2":["mani","peopl","show","kid","onli","hm","kid","approxim","year","old","watch","show","disgust","talk","kid","sure","show","know","measur","disguis","whenev","want","emphas","someth","silli","either","tv","anyth","els","uh","like","power","ranger","laugh","befor","visit","site","imagin","actual","fan","mmpr","strang","decid","watch","try","understand","peopl","like","enjoi","view","dawn","upon","mayb","enough","imagin","mai","howev","argum","suffici","rate","star"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,11,23,26,28,36,37,46,50,52,53,57,67,79,93,100,104,113,114,119,133,140,163,172,186,196,200,202,207,212,249,312,340,366,385,417,630,963,1167,1498,1510,1992,2029,2276,2459,2539,3716,4125,4173,4586],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,11,23,26,28,36,37,46,50,52,53,57,67,79,93,100,104,113,114,119,133,140,163,172,186,196,200,202,207,212,249,312,340,366,385,417,630,963,1167,1498,1510,1992,2029,2276,2459,2539,3716,4125,4173,4586],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.9218995441445863,0.9913098153388195,2.729695454751562,1.3324924169710188,4.635688258055728,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.655771293751733,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,1.9469506069506084,2.035389827120098,2.1405462403177813,2.0728240170322856,2.1521782565202803,7.329922258790048,2.1653408989309972,2.3212364753796515,2.317169775997098,2.4000574358028657,2.5001408943598484,2.571852579609833,2.478925055209576,2.5308211829319704,2.597304642813496,2.5531798379045583,2.5983793339432615,2.6754694156628323,2.8824835850471584,5.897857368910622,3.185521045582134,3.09496984188738,3.1932880749197934,3.558633189238533,4.035401218572811,4.2574141875167335,4.506310234933358,4.581533656170946,4.979216623837056,5.322690055917252,5.064116067623542,5.102830579804232,5.259176650194926,5.7959777603641776,5.822646007446338,5.850044981634453,5.999576715605417]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.572996477223059E-5,7.521929991555093E-5,7.58040582470952E-5,7.53660615909758E-5,7.536729637904226E-5,7.526194795996795E-5,7.54857875383757E-5,7.523013100324116E-5,7.539927576237191E-5,8.36513805740616E-5,0.8721500932717818,7.510869298539014E-5,7.651055949378135E-5,7.760199943708664E-5,7.516346146078873E-5,7.495574208329114E-5,7.682541930761876E-5,7.549285998687742E-5,7.525864368285469E-5,7.532101971770878E-5,7.604979476014388E-5,7.556765430784379E-5,7.565369954637218E-5,7.573520792238152E-5,7.631643673445784E-5,7.591732325505781E-5,7.910874330298407E-5,0.031934794146359344,7.513303204193493E-5,7.53233811537347E-5,7.692436198676295E-5,7.548848582029456E-5,8.103049476853445E-5,7.570082379132854E-5,7.5212798849983E-5,7.555995549746315E-5,7.513743374598121E-5,7.51818344411119E-5,7.49553654995825E-5,7.497481237951894E-5,7.514357157027117E-5,7.593617702570761E-5,7.555031339945628E-5,7.525160857953597E-5,7.616599452990773E-5,7.528049055811931E-5,7.778168743103295E-5,7.663788504529831E-5,7.499344771911415E-5,7.515918782473748E-5,7.513311978676463E-5,7.724764820613201E-5,7.516030605016769E-5,7.496815632943634E-5,7.57910391328492E-5,7.517966534976757E-5,8.084746762473754E-5,7.511770753686413E-5,7.499258046291366E-5,0.03932944667732055,7.609806312503404E-5,7.534566315033374E-5,7.497870666787278E-5

His brother Derek is a rival for Ms. Bennett's affections. When Mr. Barrymore loses his leg in a whaling accident, Bennett rejects him. He must slay the whale and win Bennett back...<br /><br />There are several scenes which may have thrilled 1930 theater audiences; particularly the scenes involving Barrymore losing his leg. The film hasn't aged well, however; there are much better films from the time, both 1920s silents and 1930s talkies. The two name attractions, John Barrymore and Joan Bennett aren't at their best. <br /><br />**** Moby Dick (8/14/30) Lloyd Bacon ~ John Barrymore, Joan Bennett, Lloyd

{"value":"This can be one of the most enjoyable movies ever if you don't take it seriously. It is a bit dated and the effects are lame, but it is so enjoyable. There are giant crabs that attack a girl. oh, and the crabs sing Japanese. It is amazingly bad. And the ending, which has been telegraphed throughout the entire film is hideously awesome. Predictable, but seeing the final fight will leave you rolling in your seat. Don't even give this film a chance and you will love it. Susan George is fun to watch and yes, she does appear naked. Her daughter isn't quite worth putting up with, but she does get attacked by giant crabs. They are the size of large cats. This is a 2, but I love it. As a movie, my God, but for entertainment, I give it a 7.

{"value":"The Underground Comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies I've ever seen. I should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase \"guaranteed to offend\" written on it... meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh.<br /><br />This movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits, bad characters, and worse jokes... from the pathetic Bat-Man sketch to the painfully unfunny Arnold Shvollenpecker skit, they just aren't funny. The few skits that are a little funny are few and far between - watching Micheal Clark Duncan play a gay virgin, for example - but even they go on too long and get ruined from Vince Offer's ineptness at comedy.<br /><br />Keep The Underground Comedy Movie underground... bury

{"value":"Where to start...Oh yea, Message to the bad guys: When you first find the person you have been tracking (in order to kill) that witnessed a crime you committed, don't spend time talking to her so that she has yet another opportunity to get away. Message to the victim: When the thugs are talking amongst themselves and arguing, take that opportunity to \"RUN AWAY\", don't sit there and watch them until you make a noise they hear. Message to the Director: if someone has a 5 or 10 minute head start in a vehicle or on foot, you can't have the bad guys on their heels or bumper right away! time and motion doesn't work that way.

{"value":"I can clearly see now why Robin Hood flopped quickly. The first episode of it is probably the worst ever thing BBC has aired. The opening scenes were about as intense, meaningful and intelligent as two monkeys fighting, Robin Hood had no character, and the sword fight was just laughable. The worst part of the episode was Robin Hood snogging some cow clad in make-up at the beginning of the episode - how many people wore eyeliner in the 12th century? Nobody. The series may have improved drastically since then, but this first episode quickly put people's hopes down, and is essentially a pile of cr*p. A great hero of England has been disgraced.<br /><br />\"Will You Tolerate This?\" I won't, that's for sure, unless the BBC start to understand what is a wise investment.

{"value":"the first Scanners may not have been a great movie,but at least it was original.there is no such novelty to this one.the acting is worse,in my opinion,and the story is slower and nothing special.i also didn't like the dialogue.and the special effects are no better than in the original.this is movie is inferior to the first one in all ways.the only thing different about it,is that it is loud and chaotic at times.but that doesn't make a good movie.if they had done something better with the story and made it interesting,this could have been a decent movie.i actually couldn't get through it all without fast forwarding through it.to me,this is a forgettable movie,and not much more.despite all that,there are worse movies.being in a generous mood,i'll give Scanners 2 a

{"value":"I could not believe how awful this film was; I rarely watch commercial TV, but thought \"Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching\". I stand corrected. Everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame.<br /><br />I realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age, but the script to this was so inept, clichéd and baffling that I am surprised it ever got into development or that Ms. Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. None of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly unlikeable. The acting looked like exercises in a BEGINNING class - I stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering \"What were they thinking?\". Very, very sad that it has come to this.
