{"value":"I felt like I was watching the Fast and the Furious again, but with different actors and a little bit different plot. I will say the cars in the film are very cool. So, if you like fast cars, then you will probably find this movie mildly entertaining. I also liked Nadia Bjorlin because I've seen her from Days of our Lives. She is a really good singer, but too bad they gave her such lousy songs to sing in this movie. I mean songs about cars; not exactly what you would here on the radio. Since it is a Hollywood film, you have to give this story a little lee way, but in real life I don't think any average joe would come across such a hot girl as Nadia Bjorlin who can drive a race car, fix a car engine, and be a lead singer. It's just all very silly.<br /><br />Another side note, any one willing to wager 25 million on a car race is a nut. But it was kinda of cool at the end when Natasha stops right before the finish line and screws Michael over. Priceless.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: This movie is for car freaks. So, if you like fast cars, then I'd recommend this.","finished_norm":["i","feel","like","i","be","watch","the","fast","and","the","furiou","again","but","with","differ","actor","and","a","littl","bite","differ","plot","i","will","sai","the","car","in","the","film","be","veri","cool","so","if","you","like","fast","car","then","you","will","probabl","find","thi","movi","mildli","entertain","i","conjur","like","nadia","bjorlin","becaus","i","have","see","her","from","dai","of","our","live","she","be","a","realli","good","singer","but","too","bad","thei","give","her","such","lousi","song","to","sing","in","thi","movi","i","mean","song","about","car","not","exactli","what","you","would","here","on","the","radio","sinc","it","be","a","hollywood","film","you","have","to","give","thi","stori","a","littl","lee","wai","but","in","real","life","i","do","not","think","ani","averag","joe","would","come","across","such","a","hot","girl","a","nadia","bjorlin","who","can","drive","a","race","car","fix","a","car","engin","and","be","a","lead","singer","it","just","all","veri","sillybr","br","anoth","side","note","ani","on","will","to","wager","million","on","a","car","race","be","a","nut","but","it","be","kinda","of","cool","at","the","end","when","natasha","stop","right","befor","the","finish","line","and","screw","michael","over","pricelessbr","br","final","verdict","thi","movi","be","for","car","freak","so","if","you","like","fast","car","then","i","have","recommend","thi"],"filtered":["feel","like","watch","fast","furiou","differ","actor","littl","bite","differ","plot","sai","car","film","veri","cool","like","fast","car","probabl","find","thi","movi","mildli","entertain","conjur","like","nadia","bjorlin","becaus","see","dai","live","realli","good","singer","bad","thei","give","lousi","song","sing","thi","movi","mean","song","car","exactli","radio","sinc","hollywood","film","give","thi","stori","littl","lee","wai","real","life","think","ani","averag","joe","come","across","hot","girl","nadia","bjorlin","drive","race","car","fix","car","engin","lead","singer","veri","sillybr","br","anoth","side","note","ani","wager","million","car","race","nut","kinda","cool","end","natasha","stop","right","befor","finish","line","screw","michael","pricelessbr","br","final","verdict","thi","movi","car","freak","like","fast","car","recommend","thi"],"filtered2":["feel","like","watch","fast","furiou","differ","actor","littl","bite","differ","plot","car","veri","cool","like","fast","car","probabl","find","mildli","entertain","conjur","like","nadia","bjorlin","becaus","see","dai","live","realli","good","singer","bad","give","lousi","song","sing","mean","song","car","exactli","radio","sinc","hollywood","give","stori","littl","lee","wai","real","life","think","ani","averag","joe","come","across","hot","girl","nadia","bjorlin","drive","race","car","fix","car","engin","lead","singer","veri","sillybr","anoth","side","note","ani","wager","million","car","race","nut","kinda","cool","end","natasha","stop","right","befor","finish","line","screw","michael","pricelessbr","final","verdict","car","freak","like","fast","car","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,9,12,13,14,15,17,22,24,27,30,32,33,34,38,39,41,43,73,75,79,80,84,88,107,116,121,132,148,154,156,157,162,195,204,284,298,300,315,328,425,461,462,466,481,503,542,560,570,573,643,659,666,807,821,1117,1123,1314,1397,1452,1560,1703,1765,2116,2186,2716,4357,4480,6361,6512],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,9,12,13,14,15,17,22,24,27,30,32,33,34,38,39,41,43,73,75,79,80,84,88,107,116,121,132,148,154,156,157,162,195,204,284,298,300,315,328,425,461,462,466,481,503,542,560,570,573,643,659,666,807,821,1117,1123,1314,1397,1452,1560,1703,1765,2116,2186,2716,4357,4480,6361,6512],"values":[2.5841531782306313,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.2350163994518417,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,2.600540117735859,2.6728839783437044,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.8950689206770979,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,1.9951803900462557,2.2212694515902225,2.0317223413467334,2.1439533986393955,2.2466628996789315,2.2190595059394194,2.253494045787767,2.3018654096236517,2.348499626138016,2.3451551414151686,2.3360150694757706,2.3586007221245198,2.51289241584188,5.249049228095168,24.88798944130623,2.7819920465008363,2.932274249550174,2.854312708080462,6.310084991849437,3.226987993365636,3.358217889001879,3.2639531875991072,3.4446025032006995,6.707261449989946,3.3490645070153917,10.341335744418377,3.462302

{"value":"I liked it, i really did. Please don't think that i'm an idiot but i have to admit that i enjoyed this film. I expected it to be crap, it was crap, but sometimes its OK to relax and watch a crappy film that you don't have to concentrate too much on isn't it? I didn't expect any hidden meanings or morales, and there wasn't any, but that doesn't matter because i only watched it for entertainment, and it did entertain me throughout. Films like this are why the Ben Stillers (excusing 'there's something about Mary') and the Vince Vaughns (however you spell his last name, i couldn't be bothered checking)have jobs. It's OK to watch a crap film as long as you don't expect too much from it, and i for one shall take a stand, jog, perhaps run, but not drive because i don't have a car, to Blockbuster Video, or even Choices, and rent a bunch of these toilet humoured films and stay in one night watching them.

{"value":"had to see this cos it looked like a great scary premise- prisoners finding magic book,oo err! claustrophobic terror ensues, etc. <br /><br />but there didn't seem to be a story to go along with the great idea. rather than chilling/physcological horror, it relied on effects out in the open- fire and OTT body horror- , which didn't scare at all if your over 12. <br /><br />The logic at the end is ridiculous, with characters being killed off for nothing other than bodycount. waste of good characters- which were the best thing about this film.<br /><br />obviously low budget, which doesn't spoil it, the film really goes nowhere, and- icant believe im going to say this- it needs a Hollywood remake. you simply loose interest in this version. definitely not in the same league as other french films coming out in the last few years like crimson rivers which were at least watchable/entertaining, malefique isn't watchable to the end to be honest. and i bet you can guess the

{"value":"Don't get the impression from other reviewers that this film stinks cos it's ambivalent about the Japanese whaling industry (which, morally, is no worse than the US meat trade or the Scottish haggis cull), it stinks cos it's pretentious tosh, the sort of up-its-own-behind guff that gets modern art a bad name. That said, there are some stunning images, but there are stunning images in the average bus ride if you use your imagination, so that's no reason to go and see this nonsense. What happens in the film happens very slowly and often accompanied by a soundtrack that sounds like a cat being gutted, and then, just when you thinks it's finished, it starts again. I saw it it in a porn cinema in Rome which had been hired for the weekend to show Barney's film works, which is an admirable and clever way to reclaim what had once been a local fleapit from the

{"value":"T. Rama Rao made some extremely beautiful films in the 1980s, but he seems to be a filmmaker who cannot mature with the changing times, styles and fashions. He's like stuck with the same old-fashioned film-making style.<br /><br />Actors are not bad, not good either. Anil Kapoor generally acts convincingly his two roles of a father and his son, but the flawed script often makes him look funny and pathetic. Rekha is good, but then - she's always good, and here she's nothing more than such. She makes the best of what she is given, but she always does that. In conclusion, nothing great at all. Raveena is OK, which means ordinary, not bad, not good, nothing.<br /><br />This film is melodramatic, occasionally stupid. Maybe it's a delayed film? Well, even then it still would be below standard. The script is terrible, the film is overdone, and the story goes nowhere. It feels like a film made in the early 1990s, but the script makes it look even older, the style is like from the 1950s.<br /><br />Don't recommend, unless you're a big fan one of the starring

{"value":"I used to have a fascination with the cartoon back in college when it was being made. It had much the charm of \"Get Smart\". While it admittedly had its faults, it was rather enjoyable.<br /><br />Naturally I was very interested in seeing the film version. That was before I saw it. Afterwords I wished it had never been made.<br /><br />Besides being miscast all around (who on Earth though Broderick was even close to the role?) it just didn't make the grade.<br /><br />The effects were reasonable and perhaps the ONLY thing I liked about the movie; seeing a live-action version of the gadgets in action! What was missing was a story and treatment which made it funny or charming or interesting.<br /><br />The original was a wacky cartoon with a very lighthearted attitude. It was FUN. The motion picture became murky and took itself FAR too seriously. If it had seriously had a great plot or went crazy enough to make it seem like a \"cartoon on film\" it might have been enjoyable.<br /><br />As it exists it doesn't deserve to be considered part of

{"value":"I love Westerns. I could watch them all day. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is my all time favorite. I watched \"Silverado\" for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on CMT. However, this movie, Shiloh Falls is without a doubt the worst Western I have ever watched. The acting was terrible all around. They explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing. The only good part I can think of is the good-looking cantina girl. The very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length. This movie wasn't even worth the new rental fee I paid at our local movie rental store. I felt like I was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing. Only reason I finished it was because I hate to not see a movie through to the end. I turned it off half way through because it was so bad. To the director, please do a better job if you decide to make another.

{"value":"This is the only film I've seen that is made by Uwe Boll, I knew that he is probably the worst director ever who always makes films based on video games also that \"House of the Dead\" is one of IMDb bottom 100. But I still wanted to watch it because I'm a huge fan of the game and I wanted to see what doe's the film have that makes it so bad. After watching it I do agree that it is crap, the movie had no story. In the first 15-20 minutes there was nothing but topless teenage girls with no brains running about (for a moment there I was wondering are the zombies brain-dead? or the girls are?) then at night time the zombies popped out of nowhere & started attacking people later a woman started shooting them I mean it takes you one place then the other every 5 minutes. Is it supposed to be a comedy?, or horror? or both? Before I knew it I fell asleep at the second half & woke up during the end credits so I did not manage to watch all of it, which is a good thing! The film is a true insult to the classic game, Uwe Boll please do not make any more films.

{"value":"It was probably just my DVD---but I would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a DVD.<br /><br />I had to turn up the volume on my TV to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. Some of the talking still remained sub-audible. If you're from Scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a slim one.<br /><br />Peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, footsteps, even puffing on a cigarette. <br /><br />With the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard, I can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment, such as a disco. And that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down.<br /><br />There is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing.

{"value":"Jack Black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing, but in this movie...<br /><br />Besides the direction, writing, lack of plot, constant mugging (aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots), and a .050 joke batting average, it was still an utter waste of time. The idea sounds promising, but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction I've seen this side of you-tube.<br /><br />I kept hearing that this film portrayed Mexicans very negatively. While that's no doubt true, I really don't think this movie is meant to be racist. I think that's it's more a result of a \"creative\" team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess. You can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera: \"Hey look, it's an ugly Mexican! Laugh, people! Please, for the love of all things tenacious, LAUGH!\"<br /><br />But put the racism charges aside.

{"value":"I have to admit, I don't remember much about the characters or the story, though I'm not sure there was one, I was soooo irritated by this movie that I had a bit of a hard time focusing on it. How can you name a movie \"Keys to Tulsa\" and then film it in Texas? The flat desert country around Arlington ( I think that was the location) in no way resembles the green rolling hills around Tulsa, and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in. Obviously no one in the movie has EVER BEEN to Tulsa or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even resembled it. Hadn't anyone at least seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders? I know this sounds picky but I can't help it. I watched this because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting. But even these two intriguing actors could not liven up this meandering,and mean story of self-involved people who are NOT IN TULSA!! I'm sorry, it can't be more expensive to film in Oklahoma.

{"value":"If you want to checkout a good Jason Scott Lee film, I recommend the following:<br /><br />Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story<br /><br />Rapa Nui<br /><br />\"Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision\" is an awful film. Awful production values. Awful acting. Awful script. I would not recommend this film to be watched by anyone who seriously believes that tripe like this is quality entertainment or advances Asian American awareness in Hollywood (This film does neither.).<br /><br />I would at the very least say that this film is passable entertainment on a rainy day if you ever come across it while channel surfing. If you are curious, perhaps a rental from Netflix, but this film is definitely not for keeps.<br /><br />If you are one of the few people who watched this film as a means to raise your Asian American film awareness, and came away disappointed, then I recommend the following films for your personal viewing.

{"value":"Sorry, but I will spoil both the plot line and the ending for you in hopes of avoiding a holiday fiasco like the one that I now face. The father dies and the mother asks Santa in a letter to bring him back to the family for Christmas,...and Santa does. Dad is peachy, happy healthy and totally unaware of the fact that he had died. All ends syrupy sweet.<br /><br />But as a parent who recently watched my five year-old lose his best canine friend, it was a horror flick. Now my son is convinced that all he has to do to bring his buddy back is to ask Santa! Do not underestimate the willpower of a young heart- no amount of persuasion will convince him that it was only a movie and that his dog is NOT coming back for Christmas. It has been heart breaking to watch his joy only to know that Christmas Eve he will have to face his loss afresh.<br /><br />Shame on you on behalf of all the believers that have lost a loved one recently. It is hard enough to deal with the loss one time for a child, but there are some wishes that we shouldn't even portray as a

{"value":"Turn your backs away or you're gonna get in big trouble out of MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK! Only a happy ending can bloom your innocence that is full of gloom and doom at the very moment you're watching this. It's safe to say that the entire movie falls apart, with a sarcastic approach and tribute to zombie shows that defy nonsense to the max. We get a name like \"Johnny\" every so often, and this \"Johnny\" has nowhere to go. There isn't a specific reason to why our \"dead corpse\" crawls out of his grave just to survive until prom night, so that renders the movie totally useless. Without a feeling of sorrow, his mother is convinced to tell the doctor that he's dead. Johnny takes a bite out of Eddie's arm afterwards. The viewer is asked a tough question: Why does the movie have to be this cornball? There is an answer. Any resemblance to all persons living or dead is purely coincidental. \"Living\" is a coincidence. \"Dead\" has nothing in common with the movie.

{"value":"...let me count the ways.<br /><br />1. A title-only 'remake' that pulls out every cliché in the slasher handbook.<br /><br />2. A plot so predictable that it becomes quite pathetic.<br /><br />3. A completely weak execution of all attempts at suspense or thrills.<br /><br />4. A PG-13 rating that insures no gore, violence, or sex.<br /><br />5. A villain that is not frightening or even mysterious.<br /><br />6. A cast of characters that are so thinly written and stereotyped that we couldn't possibly care about them.<br /><br />7. A lack of any effectively creepy atmosphere (much unlike the original Prom Night).<br /><br />8. A script of dialog that's beyond poor - it's mind numbing. <br /><br />9. A series of cardboard performances (not sure whether to blame the actors or the lousy aforementioned script for that).<br /><br />10. A completely inept teen-targeted slasher remake that's not brave enough to attempt to have an imagination - or even to show a puddle of blood.<br /><br />It's a no-brainer horror fans, save your

{"value":"Words can't describe how bad this movie is. I can't explain it by writing only. You have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how horrible a movie really can be. Not that I recommend you to do that. There are so many clichés, mistakes (and all other negative things you can imagine) here that will just make you cry. To start with the technical first, there are a LOT of mistakes regarding the airplane. I won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They didn't even manage to show an airliner in the colors of a fictional airline, but instead used a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery. Very bad. The plot is stupid and has been done many times before, only much, much better. There are so many ridiculous moments here that i lost count of it really early. Also, I was on the bad guys' side all the time in the movie, because the good guys were so stupid. \"Executive Decision\" should without a doubt be you're choice over this one, even the \"Turbulence\"-movies are better.

{"value":"The Underground Comedy Movie, is possibly the worst train wrecks I've ever seen. Luckily I didn't pay for this movie, and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was. I love off color comedy. I figured at the least it would have that and I would be entertained. No, instead the acting was so awful, the \"jokes\" were extremely cheesy, and the plot was no where to be found. Maybe there wasn't supposed to be a plot so I can't hold that against this movie. It's pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat.....by Batman...A man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat. Hilarious. Simply genius. I got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it. Perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didn't understand. Or perhaps it's the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the Arctic Ocean.<br /><br />P.S.

{"value":"Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction. This is the case with \"The Mummy's Tomb.\"<br /><br />The script is leftover ideas from older, better Universal horror flicks like \"Dracula\" and \"Frankenstein.\" The direction is trite and stale. The acting is mediocre. Even Chaney's Kharis is feeble compared to Tom Tyler's in \"The Mummy's Hand,\" and the producers are foolish enough to add footage from Christy Cabanne's vastly better prequel and point up the weakness of their own film!<br /><br />Universal realized how bad this movie was, and essentially remade it from scratch two years later as \"The Mummy's Ghost\" with a much better script and better director. The result was likely the best film in their four film \"Mummy\" cycle, although not anywhere near as good as Karl Freund's 1932 original.<br /><br />Cabanne's footage raises this film to a 3. The \"new\" stuff is a 2 at best.

{"value":"Considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the late 1980's, Personal Best could have done better to play the same-sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as a more than experimental phase of Cahill's life.<br /><br />It seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same-sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole. This random scene had VERY LITTLE relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie. I suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie (the 1980 Oregon Track and Field Competition).<br /><br />This review may seem harsh, but it is the truth. The exploitation of young Muriel Hemingway's body and the same-sex relationship ruined any credit that I would have given to this film.<br /><br />Pepper

{"value":"I do not even want to call this thing a film - it is a movie that should not have won any awards. The acting was horrible as were the silly scenarios. This is exactly the sort of film that so many folks think caters to an NRI audience but is in fact loathed abroad for its awkwardness and the overwhelming sense of \"trying\" throughout the movie. <br /><br />I find it strange that so many actors conversant with the English language have such a hard time doing so convincingly in front of the camera. I'm sure many readers know what I am talking about - all those token English phrases thrown into a movie, in Hindi and in regional cinema for cool points. There are few Indian movies in which the English seems completely genuine - Being Cyrus was a recent one. Although not a great film, it was a good film and the language did not seem \"put on\". <br /><br />I feel ashamed that P3 was awarded the NFA in 2005. The only semi-enjoyable parts of this rubbish were Konkana and a somewhat catchy background score.

{"value":"1st watched 12/7/2002 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Steve Purcell): Typical Mary Kate & Ashley fare with a few more kisses. It looks to me like the girls are getting pretty tired of this stuff and it will be interesting what happens to them if they ever decide to split up and go there own ways. In this episode of their adventures they are interns in Rome for a `fashion' designer who puts them right into the mailroom to learn what working hard is all about(I guess..). Besides the typical flirtations with boys there is nothing much else except the Rome scenario until about ¾ way into the movie when it's finally revealed why they are getting fired, then re-hired, then fired again, then re-hired again. This is definetly made by people who don't understand the corporate world and it shows in their interpretation of it. Maybe the real world will be their next adventure(if there is one.). Even my kids didn't seem to care for this boring `adventure' in the make-believe. Let's see they probably only have a couple of years till their legal adults.

{"value":"I rarely make these comments but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I endured in watching this movie. It's so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply can't suspend disbelief. The problem starts early, when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new Porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle, overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. That kind of life on a government salary? Hah! It only gets worse. Toward the end, when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys, the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die, in order to cleanse the gene pool. The special effects are pretty good - any producer's money can buy that - and the lead actors have been great in other films, but the screenplay and direction here are moronic. Many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhoeven's previous, facially stupid movies (Showgirls, Starship Troopers), but this movie should stop the wondering.

{"value":"I loved the first \"Azumi\" movie. I've seen Ms. Ueto in a variety of her TV appearances and I've seen my fair share of samurai and ninja flicks. I have to say that this movie was much weaker than I'd expected.<br /><br />Given the movie's cast and set up in \"Azumi\", they should have been able to do a much better job with this movie, but instead it was slow, plodding in parts, and sprinkled with very poor, unconvincing, and wooden acting.<br /><br />When they bothered to reference the first movie, they did so in a manner that was pretty loose and weak.

Unfortunately, the movie suffers overall from the simple fact that Shusuke Kaneko and Yoshiaki Kawajiri are not Ryuhei Kitamura and Isao Kiriyama. The latter two truly captured the \"manga\" feel in their screenplay whereas the former never quite \"got

{"value":"1st watched 2/28/2006 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Sydney Pollack):-DVD version I watched titled \"3 Days of the Condor\"- So so CIA drama full of laid-back performances making for a very laid-back movie. The premise of the story revolves around 7 out of 8 members of a CIA research group being killed with Robert Redford's character, codename = Condor, being the one that was left. Who killed them and why? That's what Redford tries to find out while trying to not be the 8th victim at the same time. Along the way, he gets Faye Dunaway's character involved involved, originally because he needs a place to hide, and then she eventually helps him out after a little lovey-dovey time. This is one of a handful of innocent guy on the run stories but this one doesn't have a lot of suspense. The flat performances don't help and the finish doesn't seal the deal for the audience enough either. Despite having a good director in Sydney Pollack and a group of classic performers, the story and the performances are not what they should be and therefore the movie is not what it should

{"value":"Time spent watching this film was time wasted. I do not dislike science fiction. I do not reject any genre per se, since good work can be done in any genre. This film, however is not good work. I cannot fault the visuals (when not involving alien makeups), and the special effects are impressive. The story was not out-and-out BAD, for a trekkish comic book. But the fx visuals were obviously where all the makers' interest/attention/money went. The direction alternated between sluggish and confusing (one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial juncture). The \"acting\" was mostly very bad indeed. There was no basis to most of the line readings besides a hint of \"It was that way on the page and the director told me I was supposed to be mad/sad/scared/whatever. Okay, so it was a SF series pilot. Since when is that an excuse for correctable shoddiness in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium. I'm astonished the pilot sold the series.

{"value":"This movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen such stinkers like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). However, I love bad horror movies, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. At times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever, especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film. The acting is nonexistent, and most of the camera shot are of women's areas shrink wrapped in spandex. The policeman was the most stone-faced, monotone actor I've ever seen. The best/worst part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. A giant safety pin?! What were they thinking? Who's the killer? A disgruntled \"Huggies\" employee?

{"value":"Don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it.<br /><br />I saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). They like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). The theater was almost full, and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. To tell the truth I was bored silly. It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny. There were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it. Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just didn't work. My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. My daughter fell asleep half way through. Also, the kids thought the character animation looked weird. I haven't heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express, which gave my daughter nightmares.<br /><br />Trust me, I'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything.

{"value":"It's hard to believe that this is a sequel to Henry Fool. Hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies. While Henry Fool is refreshing, witty, comical, Fay Grim is slow, boring, and doesn't go anywhere. Where has the wit gone? I am baffled.<br /><br />It is 10 years since I saw Henry Fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory. Fay Grim is painful to watch. This is no fault of the actors, who are good (Parker Posey) or great (Jeff Goldblum) -- the blame lies entirely with the plot, the dialog, and even some of the filming (low budget is no excuse). A huge disappointment. <br /><br />Sorry I couldn't pay attention to the plot, I was so bored, so disappointed... if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy Henry Fool so much... the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other... there is no continuity in the characters' personalities... it's all a fraud to entice fans of Henry Fool to watch the sequel.<br /><br />I'm switching this

{"value":"\"Mad Dog Time\"...\"Trigger Happy\" whatever you wanna call it...simply doesn't hit the mark. Maybe its just me, maybe i just don't like Gangster comedies ( as i thought Oscar , Johney Dangerously and Mafia also sucked ) It's probably more \"witty sharp wordplay\" than all out Comedy, only its not as witty and sharp as it ( or the other reviewers )Make it out to be. <br /><br />The Rick , Mick , Vic Thing was old to begin with making it a running gag was at times painful to watch. <br /><br />There wasn't enough Changes of Location or Feel for the period they were supposed to be in. The Majority of the film was either set in \"Dreyfus's Club\" or a variety of Offices /dim rooms... ( what was with that Sit down Gun stand off thing Goldblum kept winning ?) <br /><br />The supporting cast was... on Paper excellent ( great to see Silva & Drago)but characters were killed off before they had time to develop. and Richard Pryors cameo was a Joke !

{"value":"Well...i was going to wait till this came out on video to see it, and i wish i had, I actually caught scary movie 2 on cable the other day, and it made me yearn for more of the same, what i got was AIRPLANE on CRACK... i mean if you like Airplane or any other Leslie nielsen vehicles, then you'll probably be in heaven, but if your used to the usually WAYANS COMEDY, then you will be dissapointed, there was alot more Eye candy in this one which will keep young hormone raged teenage boys happy, which is probably why it was a box office hit the first week it came out. I enjoyed scary movie 2 ten times more then this fodder, and part one 5 times as much. Odd that the better of the 3 is part 2, but then again i always liked Halloween 2 better then the original as well..maybe its just me. The funniest part of the movie has to be the way the Aliens Say Goodbye. But that wasnt worth the 11 dollars i spent to catch a matinee of this with my fiance. Save yourself cash and catch part 2 again on cable till this is released on Video tape, and then Rent it, dont buy it.","finished_norm":["welli","be","go","to","wait","till","thi","come","out","on","video","to","see","it","and","i","wish","i","have","i","actual","catch","scari","movi","on","cabl","the","other","dai","and","it","make","me","yearn","for","much","of","the","same","what","i","get","be","airplan","on","crack","i","mean","if","you","like","airplan","or","ani","other","lesli","nielsen","vehicl","then","you","will","probabl","be","in","heaven","but","if","your","us","to","the","usual","wayan","comedi","then","you","will","be","dissapoint","there","be","alot","much","ey","candi","in","thi","on","which","will","keep","young","hormon","rage","teenag","boi","happi","which","be","probabl","why","it","be","a","box","offic","hit","the","week","it","come","out","i","enjoi","scari","movi","ten","time","much","then","thi","fodder","and","part","on","time","a","much","odd","that","the","well","of","the","be","part","but","then","again","i","alwai","like","halloween","well","then","the","origin","a","wellmayb","it","just","me","the","funni","part","of","the","movi","have","to","be","the","wai","the","alien","sai","goodby","but","that","wasnt","worth","the","dollar","i","spend","to","catch","a","matine","of","thi","with","my","fianc","save","yourself","cash","and","catch","part","again","on","cabl","till","thi","be","releas","on","video","tape","and","then","rend","it","do","bui","it"],"filtered":["welli","go","wait","till","thi","come","video","see","wish","actual","catch","scari","movi","cabl","dai","make","yearn","much","get","airplan","crack","mean","like","airplan","ani","lesli","nielsen","vehicl","probabl","heaven","us","usual","wayan","comedi","dissapoint","alot","much","ey","candi","thi","keep","young","hormon","rage","teenag","boi","happi","probabl","box","offic","hit","week","come","enjoi","scari","movi","ten","time","much","thi","fodder","part","time","much","odd","well","part","alwai","like","halloween","well","origin","wellmayb","funni","part","movi","wai","alien","sai","goodby","wasnt","worth","dollar","spend","catch","matine","thi","fianc","save","cash","catch","part","cabl","till","thi","releas","video","tape","rend","bui"],"filtered2":["welli","go","wait","till","come","video","see","wish","actual","catch","scari","cabl","dai","make","yearn","get","airplan","crack","mean","like","airplan","ani","lesli","nielsen","vehicl","probabl","heaven","us","usual","wayan","comedi","dissapoint","alot","ey","candi","keep","young","hormon","rage","teenag","boi","happi","probabl","box","offic","hit","week","come","enjoi","scari","ten","time","fodder","part","time","odd","well","part","alwai","like","halloween","well","origin","wellmayb","funni","part","wai","alien","goodby","wasnt","worth","dollar","spend","catch","matine","fianc","save","cash","catch","part","cabl","till","releas","video","tape","rend","bui"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,20,27,33,34,52,56,61,62,69,88,127,132,134,135,148,189,197,200,219,240,265,281,282,283,327,331,347,388,396,399,512,531,545,565,587,605,654,692,768,857,1039,1403,1424,1453,1535,1543,1788,1925,1926,2004,2487,2959,3086,3171,4446,5161,5775,6176,6271,6449],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,20,27,33,34,52,56,61,62,69,88,127,132,134,135,148,189,197,200,219,240,265,281,282,283,327,331,347,388,396,399,512,531,545,565,587,605,654,692,768,857,1039,1403,1424,1453,1535,1543,1788,1925,1926,2004,2487,2959,3086,3171,4446,5161,5775,6176,6271,6449],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,2.330690080046114,1.3002700588679295,1.4018535447685214,2.7965700178917925,1.7122153074726136,1.8610609350701788,7.527406818957011,2.0226120445069267,2.127032521151058,2.0317223413467334,2.4359679371086367,2.253494045787767,2.2443961816702407,2.366244071437088,4.603730819247303,2.498193474075453,2.558331832813986,2.5308211829319704,2.5792094178355414,5.533214255322713,2.73529586597515,2.832333801361687,2.918851229218033,2.7678802023081546,2.9674191958529437,2.932274249550174,3.0151989841543516,3.0914425013694116,6.583053029006414,3.129115117668582,10.109336134208865,3.424750734647968,3.442099372982581,3.9081109809587793,3.6105180246075443,3.5474598886404074,3.634471265630037,3.753391311073496,3.8059428063999263,3.9612932464190886,4.145296889396028,4.550761997504193,4.470719289830655,4.506310234933358,9.116733193778822,4.706176101378222,4.828393734102471,9.780538275641119,4.828393734102471,5.014723312293965,5.2288713006995975,11.16683263676101,6.032366538428407,5.649374286172302,5.967828017290836,6.214688095222362,6.342521466732247,6.489124940924123,6.543192162194399,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"val

{"value":"This movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were put together by the most shameless lunatics to ever work on a TV movie. The story is wrong and a complete lie. There is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays Senator McCarthy. It's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry. The marxist-leninists who wrote this trash did so in order to attack a man who has been vindicated by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism. Unfortunately for these communist nut jobs, Ronald Reagan took over where McCarthy left off and they couldn't stop him, thus the end of the Soviet Union and its' cohorts.<br /><br />Never, ever watch this film if you're looking for truth regarding Sen. McCarthy. Read Ann Coulter's book, \"Treason\" for a better look at the truth about Sen.

{"value":"Bruce Lee was a great martial artist, but this film still is probably one of the worst films ever made. It has Bruce Lee die as the result of falling off a helicopter after being hit by some kind of a ninja knife to the back of the neck but it doesn't explain how he came to be on a helicopter since the prior scene has him near but not on the helicopter which is already 200 feet in the air. It just gets downright absurd from then, like something out of a cheap comic book. Maybe the idea isn't so rotten but it isn't done with any degree of artistry from a film making point of view. There are dozens of such martial arts bombers out there, usually all made in Hong Kong. I think that Jean Claude van Dam improved the genre with adding plausible stories in his films and having film makers who know how to use the camera. Even Steven Seagal's films are way better than 90 percent of the martial arts junk movies made during the 1970s and early 1980s in Hong Kong. 'Game of Death II' falls into the category of junk cinema in my opinion, despite Bruce Lee being in
