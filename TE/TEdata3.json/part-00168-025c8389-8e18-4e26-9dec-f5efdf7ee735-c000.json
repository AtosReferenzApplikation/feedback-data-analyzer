{"value":"The story is a little slow and a little stupid. Greta Garbo doesn't look very good and I couldn't understand half the things she said because of her accent, which was exaggerated for this role. Melvyn Douglas, meanwhile, plays his normal unlikeable role and Constance Bennett is just so-so except for a couple of her screams, which were funny. <br /><br />On the plus side, Roland Young had the best role in the film. I wish he had more lines, as he disappeared in the second half of the story. Also, it was interesting to see Ruth Gordon look so young. I had only seen her in those crazy roles she played from the late '60s to the '80s and a whacked out old woman. Story-wise, the best part might have been the final few minutes when we see a stunt man doing amazing things on skis, pretending to be Douglas falling down the slopes. That was amazing and humorous footage.<br /><br />Overall, I can see where this film - Garbo's last - was not a box-office success. It just drags too much, going on and on about deceptions. It's an annoying story. Garbo knew it, too, and called it quits.","finished_norm":["the","stori","be","a","littl","slow","and","a","littl","stupid","greta","garbo","doe","not","look","veri","good","and","i","can","not","understand","half","the","thing","she","sai","becaus","of","her","accent","which","be","exagger","for","thi","role","melvyn","dougla","meanwhil","plai","hi","normal","unlik","role","and","constanc","bennett","be","just","soso","except","for","a","coupl","of","her","scream","which","be","funni","br","br","on","the","plu","side","roland","young","have","the","well","role","in","the","film","i","wish","he","have","much","line","a","he","disappear","in","the","half","of","the","stori","conjur","it","be","interest","to","see","ruth","gordon","look","so","young","i","have","onli","see","her","in","that","crazi","role","she","plai","from","the","late","to","the","and","a","whack","out","old","woman","storywis","the","well","part","mai","have","be","the","final","few","minut","when","we","see","a","stunt","man","do","amaz","thing","on","ski","pretend","to","be","dougla","fall","down","the","slope","that","be","amaz","and","humor","footagebr","br","overal","i","can","see","where","thi","film","garbo","last","be","not","a","boxoffic","success","it","just","drag","too","much","go","on","and","on","about","decept","it","a","annoi","stori","garbo","know","it","too","and","call","it","quit"],"filtered":["stori","littl","slow","littl","stupid","greta","garbo","doe","look","veri","good","understand","half","thing","sai","becaus","accent","exagger","thi","role","melvyn","dougla","meanwhil","plai","hi","normal","unlik","role","constanc","bennett","soso","except","coupl","scream","funni","br","br","plu","side","roland","young","well","role","film","wish","much","line","disappear","half","stori","conjur","interest","see","ruth","gordon","look","young","onli","see","crazi","role","plai","late","whack","old","woman","storywis","well","part","mai","final","minut","see","stunt","man","amaz","thing","ski","pretend","dougla","fall","slope","amaz","humor","footagebr","br","overal","see","thi","film","garbo","last","boxoffic","success","drag","much","go","decept","annoi","stori","garbo","know","call","quit"],"filtered2":["stori","littl","slow","littl","stupid","greta","garbo","doe","look","veri","good","understand","half","thing","becaus","accent","exagger","role","melvyn","dougla","meanwhil","plai","normal","unlik","role","constanc","bennett","soso","except","coupl","scream","funni","plu","side","roland","young","well","role","wish","line","disappear","half","stori","conjur","interest","see","ruth","gordon","look","young","onli","see","crazi","role","plai","late","whack","old","woman","storywis","well","part","mai","final","minut","see","stunt","man","amaz","thing","ski","pretend","dougla","fall","slope","amaz","humor","footagebr","overal","see","garbo","last","boxoffic","success","drag","go","decept","annoi","stori","garbo","know","call","quit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,11,14,15,16,17,18,20,22,26,29,39,40,45,46,59,60,61,62,67,70,107,120,128,135,136,142,144,150,156,169,206,212,232,253,271,369,390,399,412,425,526,532,559,615,685,700,712,749,764,1203,1371,1544,1728,1904,2046,2099,3656,3721,4741,4744,5494,5624,6671,7656,8514],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,11,14,15,16,17,18,20,22,26,29,39,40,45,46,59,60,61,62,67,70,107,120,128,135,136,142,144,150,156,169,206,212,232,253,271,369,390,399,412,425,526,532,559,615,685,700,712,749,764,1203,1371,1544,1728,1904,2046,2099,3656,3721,4741,4744,5494,5624,6671,7656,8514],"values":[2.6228008218775787,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,3.83116108203179,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,2.6390769554676132,1.5538940054862738,3.2569937516641474,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,1.9570915389266579,2.094675786251684,2.1439533986393955,2.2044500422972613,9.363960816463537,4.732488142874176,2.346825985579986,2.2844323215331563,2.2931108769894046,2.332712011146513,2.3451551414151686,2.4071371113909277,5.194609285626992,2.5983793339432615,2.6102777977348763,2.7073305177318163,2.757740698455715,3.121829110937649,3.132778125427319,3.129115117668582,3.107414446935464,3.226987993365636,3.5119855004467477,3.4446025032006995,3.5727776966246974,3.5013187326425523,7.215127625420226,3.616452760127359,3.7165362186843414,3.7165362186843414,3.7465885637507435,4.3521595551061,4.436351646326448,4.6973654716960676,4.760735085628657,10.518353300389853,4.900964426937307,5.214056214914456,5.695894301807195,5.999576715605417,6.437831646536572,6.0662680

{"value":"This movie \"Joshua\" is extremely disturbing, and downright pointless. It actually makes me shudder to think there are people who would enjoy watching it. Without giving away the story it is about a young boy's reaction to his newborn sister, and that is just the tip of the iceberg. During the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable. Adding insult to injury, by the end of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the fruition of pure evil at the hands of a child no less, who outsmarted a whole group of dumb adults. There is no redemption, no justice served, and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them. Frankly, I did not enjoy watching this movie. It was extremely unsettling. Even for those who might enjoy horror movies, this movie could be too much. Despite the fact this movie was well acted, the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a 90 minute wait in a dentist's waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental procedure.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","joshua","be","extrem","disturb","and","downright","pointless","it","actual","make","me","shudder","to","think","there","be","peopl","who","would","enjoi","watch","it","without","give","awai","the","stori","it","be","about","a","young","boi","reaction","to","hi","newborn","sister","and","that","be","just","the","tip","of","the","iceberg","dure","the","entireti","of","thi","movi","the","viewer","be","subject","to","some","of","the","much","unsettl","child","behavior","imagin","add","insult","to","injuri","by","the","end","of","thi","movi","there","be","absolut","no","real","outcom","except","the","fruition","of","pure","evil","at","the","hand","of","a","child","no","littl","who","outsmart","a","whole","group","of","dumb","adult","there","be","no","redempt","no","justic","serv","and","a","whole","group","of","adult","who","be","not","smart","enough","to","see","what","be","go","on","around","them","frankli","i","do","not","enjoi","watch","thi","movi","it","be","extrem","unsettl","even","for","that","who","mai","enjoi","horror","movi","thi","movi","can","be","too","much","despit","the","fact","thi","movi","be","good","act","the","stori","itself","be","so","disturb","that","watch","it","be","equival","to","a","minut","wait","in","a","dentist","wait","room","in","anticip","of","some","pain","dental","procedur"],"filtered":["thi","movi","joshua","extrem","disturb","downright","pointless","actual","make","shudder","think","peopl","enjoi","watch","without","give","awai","stori","young","boi","reaction","hi","newborn","sister","tip","iceberg","dure","entireti","thi","movi","viewer","subject","much","unsettl","child","behavior","imagin","add","insult","injuri","end","thi","movi","absolut","real","outcom","except","fruition","pure","evil","hand","child","littl","outsmart","whole","group","dumb","adult","redempt","justic","serv","whole","group","adult","smart","enough","see","go","around","frankli","enjoi","watch","thi","movi","extrem","unsettl","even","mai","enjoi","horror","movi","thi","movi","much","despit","fact","thi","movi","good","act","stori","disturb","watch","equival","minut","wait","dentist","wait","room","anticip","pain","dental","procedur"],"filtered2":["joshua","extrem","disturb","downright","pointless","actual","make","shudder","think","peopl","enjoi","watch","without","give","awai","stori","young","boi","reaction","newborn","sister","tip","iceberg","dure","entireti","viewer","subject","unsettl","child","behavior","imagin","add","insult","injuri","end","absolut","real","outcom","except","fruition","pure","evil","hand","child","littl","outsmart","whole","group","dumb","adult","redempt","justic","serv","whole","group","adult","smart","enough","see","go","around","frankli","enjoi","watch","extrem","unsettl","even","mai","enjoi","horror","despit","fact","good","act","stori","disturb","watch","equival","minut","wait","dentist","wait","room","anticip","pain","dental","procedur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,7,12,14,17,21,23,24,30,46,52,59,80,83,93,97,98,111,125,135,155,180,200,222,232,235,239,279,282,299,321,329,331,340,391,410,420,458,513,531,550,585,709,726,734,815,839,1119,1333,1336,1424,1494,1557,2270,3030,3073,3237,3296,3641,3783,4341,4534,4639,5171,6286,7322,7508],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,7,12,14,17,21,23,24,30,46,52,59,80,83,93,97,98,111,125,135,155,180,200,222,232,235,239,279,282,299,321,329,331,340,391,410,420,458,513,531,550,585,709,726,734,815,839,1119,1333,1336,1424,1494,1557,2270,3030,3073,3237,3296,3641,3783,4341,4534,4639,5171,6286,7322,7508],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,2.8828493162168796,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.655771293751733,1.7122153074726136,1.8693254449200722,1.9951803900462557,2.292318797740072,2.035389827120098,2.0545557924622586,2.0881990796736947,4.236691060675177,2.2242236634876535,2.366244071437088,2.3074766467914385,5.419462958538709,7.592463548795911,2.5771019354959765,2.6102777977348763,2.6457189377809835,2.6593400337329487,2.7910771187233068,2.918851229218033,2.7949961309240425,3.09496984188738,5.903973581628264,5.864548499100348,2.948928684455311,3.109204957709252,6.414054501606195,3.3023374306074227,3.2829611516442836,3.454678155189441,3.4272107604888307,3.4751392270607813,3.7165362186843414,3.6497387377608255,3.6466665387238555,7.5833136983049,3.7881170224473255,7.931007557910864,4.235066888824737,4.383707912841026,4.422928625994308,4.5432147918688095,4.558366596889411,4.550761997504193,5.051537285416681,5.42

{"value":"I was gifted with this movie as it had such a great premise, the friendship of three women bespoiled by one falling in love with a younger man.<br /><br />Intriguing.<br /><br />NOT! I hasten to add. These women are all drawn in extreme caricature, not very supportive of one another and conspiring and contriving to bring each other down.<br /><br />Anna Chancellor and Imelda Staunton could do no wrong in my book prior to seeing this, but here they are handed a dismal script and told to balance the action between slapstick and screwball, which doesn't work too well when the women are all well known professionals in a very small town.<br /><br />And for intelligent women they spend a whole pile of time bemoaning the lack of men/sex/lust in their lives. I felt much more could have been made of it given a decent script and more tension, the lesbian sub-plot went nowhere and those smoking/drinking women (all 3 in their forties???) were very unrealistic - even in the baby scene - screw the baby, gimme a cigarette!

{"value":"It's been a looooonnnggg time since I saw this comedy, and I'd forgotten just how idiotic it is. I'd place this easily in the lower two or three of Elvis Presley's very worst movies. Presley plays Joe Whitecloud, a half-breed Indian bull rider who returns home to Arizona and the broken-down shack where his family lives, and where his friends love to party all night long. His parents are played by Burgess Meredith and Katy Jurado, and his old Indian grandpa is Thomas Gomez. None of the three offer anything of substance , comically or otherwise. The government has invested in the family's cattle, but they're lacking a bull. Elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs, and is pursued by a young boy-crazy gal and her gun-toting mother. This is just a real slapdash of a mess, and the dilapidated surroundings practically stink of manure and don't make this much easier. The one thing that puzzles me, however, is that Elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film.

{"value":"This was a movie i could not wait to see! So i finally got it and I was pretty disappointed. For starters,the movie has so little said about New York,just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings,streets,bridges and cafes.It really doesn't stay focused on the New York magic.Another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie.I know that it is a remake,but it is not a french style remake! Anyway,here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies,such as long and messy scenes,no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style ! The story follows many lives ( too many for my taste) and they somehow seem connected in the end. I feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories. The movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone's happy ending.So we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each.And there you have your 120 minutes ! if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you ! i give it 4 just because i love New York and i loved the cast

{"value":"I saw this film in its entirety in the 1960s & 70s, yes it IS gruesome, and could be the progenitor of the \"Faces of Death\" series popular in the 80s & 90s. Considering the state of so-called \"driver education\" these days, this one should be required viewing for everyone preparing to learn to drive. When you see violent death in all its gore & horror, you certainly (if you have any sensibility at all) get a truer perspective on the responsibilities required to drive safely, what one instant of thoughtlessness or inattentiveness at the wheel can do. I worked for Bell Telephone in the 70s & 80s, and at one point was assigned to conduct a safety class. I found this film in the company library, showed it at the session, a number of people got physically sick and had to leave the room! Incredibly, most of them later said \"I never knew a car accident could be so terrible!\" This film, and another, \"RED ASPHALT\", is certainly reality in its most graphic form.

{"value":"The first (and only) time I saw \"Shades\" was during a Sneakpreview. It hadn't even been in premiere. I remember there was someone of the directors staff there, don't even remember who. It was a Belgian movie, we never heard of it, so we were quite neutral, not knowing what to expect. Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he's stands miles ahead all the rest. He plays an actor who's star has long stopped rising. He's helping to realise a movie in Belgium entitled \"Shades\".<br /><br />As soon as the movie started, we noticed how much swearing there is. Nothing against the occasional swear word. However this was way beyond annoying. Whenever Rourke uses the F*** word to express something, it comes naturally. However, when someone from the cast, a non-English speaker uses the F**** or S*** word, it becomes arrogant and aggressive.<br /><br />We quickly lost count of how many times they used the F and S words. Everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre.

{"value":"I've seen other Guinea Pig films, like Mermaid in a Manhole & He Never Dies, and while they're pretty sick, they at least have a bit of a sense of humor to them (however dark). Devil's Experiment though, is nothing more than filming a bunch of punks submitting a young girl to many methods of torture and violence and there's no plot and no redeeming values to it whatsoever. It isn't remotely scary, except for perhaps the mind-set, but it's definitely disgusting and I certainly would not call it entertainment. Now, I'm not the paragon of good taste in films and I like my trash and sleaze, but this was too much for me, really. I'm all for disturbing, in fact, I seek out things that are disturbing whenever possible, but this was a bit much. The young woman is kicked, beaten, submitted to continuous noise via headphones until she drools, and then pelted with raw meat and innards and left hanging in a hammock out in the woods somewhere.

well but his character gets heroic which could be subtle<br /><br />The lengthy flashback could be avoided as thigns are simply long drawn<br /><br />Even the street play in the second half look too simplistic and hardly a solution though the message is well brought out<br /><br />Direction by RKS is decent, though it could be better Music is okay<br /><br />Ajay Devgan looks the part very well and is at ease playing his part mostly though at times he does look ill at ease in light scenes He excels in dramatics Vidya excels in the scene front of media Pankaj has a not proper defined role and

{"value":"I love horror movies that brings out a real amount of mystery like say \"silent hill\" ( which i found to be quite good, but still, was missing something ) and movies that keeps you guessing, this i thought was one of those movies. At first the movie starts out with some really good suspense and builds up a good starting point for a good horror scene, but after that it just rolls down the hill and from there it only goes faster and faster down. I mentioned silent hill at first for a reason because i can see a lot of \"stolen\" themes from that movie in here.. All in all i would say, watch silent hill instead of this one, its better, its more scary, it has a lot more suspense and also the ending is a lot better.. And best of all, you wont feel ripped off as i did with this one.. This just seems to be one of those \"i like that movie so I'm gonna re-make it in my own really bad version\" kinda movie.. Oh and one more thing...

{"value":"These writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this rubbish.<br /><br />I found this rubbish film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. If I owned a video store I'd put it in the BORING section. This film is so rubbish it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.<br /><br />This film contains endless shots of people driving as if that was scary. Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's not scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the little kid does it too. Round and round he goes and he never stops. What's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? I think NOTHING and if you watch it you will not think so too.<br /><br />The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around endlessly looking at kitchens. Then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for no reason.

{"value":"I watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning, a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies. But still I think it wasn't good, this movie wasn't good at all. The reasons why are many.<br /><br />The acting isn't all that good, and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of a poor 90's Chevy Chase comedy. I mean, come on, like the handcuff situation, and the poker situation amongst the servants... This movie was so obviously based very much on the first one, and thats OK. But if I hadn't seen the first one before seeing this, it would have sucked even worse. Like the ending, it came very suddenly, and I felt like I got no closure what so ever... Sebastian changed very suddenly, and this This movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr 1, and like no time or effort was used on making anything else good. The score is the same as in the first one, and it didn't feel like a movie at all...<br /><br />They should have handled the situations with more style and class, but they didn't, and therefore, this

{"value":"So...we get so see added footage of Brando...interesting but not exactly Oscar worthy stuff. Susannah York was hardly a slouch. New scene where Lois finds out Clark is Superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn't notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets. Real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that...let's listen to Donner make fun of Lester's version that made more logical sense. The president talks of the Zod \"defacing\" the Washington monument when it was originally Mount Rushmore. Tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd. Superman's \"freedom of the press\" line sounded silly compared to \"..Care to step outside\" which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to Clark's earlier scene in the truck stop. Then there is the ending with the \"turn back the world to go back in time\" effect.

{"value":"<br /><br />I am a big-time horror/sci-fi fan regardless of budget, but after watching countless horror movies late night on cable and video, this has to be the worst of all movies. With bloody special effects (what looked like a roast covered in fake blood or ketchup that kept being shown over and over again) and people running around screaming from left, then to right, then back again. It should have stayed with the beginning convenience store scene and stopped there and been 15 minutes. Instead, it is dragged out very long. It is very, very x5 low budget. Many scenes were way, way too long. Narrator sounded very amateurish like a random person out of junior high was talking. This is the only movie to rate lower in my opinion than Manos, Red Zone Cuba, Benji,and Godzilla vs. megalon despite their higher budgets. 10 snoozes, try to stay awake through whole movie in one setting or better yet, avoid it like you would an undead brain-eating mob.

{"value":"John Candy. Need we say more? He is the main reason you should see this film. Most people don't realize how gifted he was as an actor. Witness him changing from poor slob to horny jerk. Just a simple(subtle) facial change and off we go. There are many great bits in this movie and many really dumb bits. The best moments for me are the KUNG FU U scenes as well as the great moment when John(in a trance) goes up on stage and talks about how much he loves his girlfriend-that is how much he and his genitals love his girlfriend. I'm sure reading this you might think this sequence sounds really crude. It is, but it is also very funny mainly because it is John Candy doing this bit. The story in general is pretty lame and Eugene Levy and Joe Flaherty(both SCTV alumni with Candy) are not given enough to do in the film. Levy has his moments, especially filming the wedding at the end(think Rod Serling) and the great scene when he is talking to his mother on the phone. Overall a good movie if you have had a tough day and need to put your brain on stupid.

{"value":"This movie is really bad. The acting is plain awful except Michael Ironside. I don't get the story. Richard Grieco is the only survivor after a fight between two Mc-gangs. He comes to a town and suddenly he is choosened to fight against the bad people who wants indian-land. At the cover it said he was a indian himself that returned too his home-town, I didn't hear that in the movie, if so it wasn't clear.<br /><br />Richard Grieco was one hell of a bad actor. Stiff and ugly. He said his lines like it too. And we wouldn't talk about Sean Young, she hasn' been any of my favourite actors but in this movie she plays a indian women who falls in love with Bolt (Grieco). She is awful.<br /><br />When I rented it I choosed between this and Subterfuge with Amanda Pays. I choosed this one because of Michael Ironside was in the cast. Maybe I should have taken Subterfuge.<br /><br />Don't see this unless you think Richard Grieco looks tough on a motorbike with sunglasses.<br /><br />I will soon uptade the cast-list because I have it at home.

{"value":"The first time I watched Cold Case was after it had run for about a year on Danish television. At the time it came to the TV it nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other American crime shows aired roughly the same time.<br /><br />I saw it and I was bored to death. The substandard actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind. The entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely.<br /><br />The time is also a factor as they only have 50-60 min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members, if they are still alive. This combined with the \"personal\" problems and relations of the investigators which there HAS to be time for leaves the show a complete lackluster.<br /><br />I give it a 2-star rating because of

{"value":"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers came out in 1993, supposedly based on the Japanese sentai television show that started back in the 1970s. Now as a fan of Japanese action films and series, you would think I would get a kick out of this show.<br /><br />You could not be more wrong. What worked in the Japanese version has become a complete abomination of television with mighty morphin power rangers.<br /><br />MMPR is based on five teenagers who get powers to becomes costumed superheroes with robotic dinosaurs who form an even bigger robot.<br /><br />Now this premise is more far fetched and more laughable than anything in either Transformers movie, yet, the ridiculousness of this show is often overlooked.<br /><br />It was followed by two really bad, and I do mean, really bad movie knock offs, and the actors starring in this series, completely disappeared from the scene.<br /><br />If you must choose, try watching Japan's Zyuranger series instead.<br /><br />Also, what's up with the awful long 1990s haircuts and all the earrings on the guys?

{"value":"Elvis has left the building and he's lucky because he didn't have to watch this unfunny stinker. Scene after scene director Joel Zwick finds ways to make an unfunny script even less amusing. Filled with unfunny deaths, trite gay characteratures, and hack jokes, this film is more desperate than amusing. This is the sort of film that makes one hope Kim Basinger follows Doris Day into premature retirement. Let us remember her the way she was (talented) and not what she's become. David Leisure, the delicious Dennis Richards and the rest are all wasted talents here. Zwick finds a way to minimize their talents at every turn. The guy playing Elvis sounds more like Gomer than the King.The only really good bit of casting is the young girl who plays Basinger as a preteen. She really looks like her and is actually pretty good. The only other reason to watch this film at all is to look for the Tom Hanks cameo. The cameo isn't all that funny, but at least its not painful. One has to wonder if Zwick has incriminating pictures of Hanks or something that would make him do this

{"value":"I will start this off by saying I couldn't get all the way through it. I picked it up on a rainy day from WalMart like the rest of the reviewers on this site. I figured there wasn't any way I would regret my purchase. Was I wrong or what? Seriously now, who approved this project? They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity. That's the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad. The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam. The acting isnt much better. I think the only difference is that there are a few cool cameos. Yay, who cares... Shecky Moskowitz is unfunny, and the ships comedian is an even bigger loser. That's about as much of the plot as I understood.<br /><br />Overall it's the worst movie I've ever seen. I own it on DVD and have given it to many co-workers to watch. Each comes back and laughs and says \"Wow I didnt think I'd ever say I shut off an Adam Sandler movie 15 minutes in....\"<br /><br />My response is always \"Well now you can\"<br /><br

{"value":"A pale shadow of a great musical, this movie suffers from the fact that the director, Richard Attenborough, completely misses the point of the musical, needlessly \"opens\" it up, and muddies the thrust of the play. The show is about a group of dancers auditioning for a job in a B'way musical and examines their drive & desire to work in this demanding and not-always-rewarding line of work. Attenborough gives us a fresh-faced cast of hopefuls, assuming that they are trying to get their \"big break\" in show business, rather than presenting the grittier mix of characters created on stage as a group of working \"gypsies\" living show to show, along with a couple of newcomers. The film has one advantage over the play and that is the opening scene, showing the size of the original audition and the true scale of shrinkage down to the 16/17 on the line (depending on how you count Cassie, who is stupidly kept out of the line in the movie).

{"value":"Not even Timothy Hutton or David Duchovny could save this dead fish of a film. For starters, the script was definitely written to be made into a B-film, but somehow Duchovny (looking for a star vehicle to elevate himself out of television) and Hutton (looking for the \"two\" of a \"one-two punch\" he had hoped would define his career after \"Ordinary People\") became attached to the picture. Cheesy lines, big bad wipes from scene to scene (Come on--who uses wipes after 12th Grade Telecommunications class?), and plain old bad acting sink this film. Even Duchovny is not immune to the bad acting plague that is this film. Only Timothy Hutton rises above the material at all. I must admit feeling Duchovny's pain as he read the lines that are the voice-over. While I found myself laughing when I'm sure the director wanted me to feel terrified, nothing prepared me for the closing line of Duchonvey's voice-over: \"if you ever need a doctor, be sure to call 911.\" If only the studio had called 911, this dog of a motion picture would never have been made.

{"value":"Nicholas Walker is Paul, the local town Reverand who's married to Martha (Ally Sheedy), but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair, Veronica (Dara Tomanovich). However in so doing, he gets a bout of amnesia (hence the name of the film). Sally Kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good Reverand in a shades of \"Misery\" type of way. It's sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this. Not the least bit John Savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator. In a film billed as a 'black comedy', one has to bring BOTH elements into said movie. While this does bring the former in spades, it sadly contains none of the latter. Furthermore you can't emphasize with any of the characters and as thus, have absolutely no vested interest in them. Technically not an all-together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Dara Tomanovich gets topless; Sally Kirkland also shows some skin <br /><br />My Grade: C- <br /><br

{"value":"Look, I loved the PROPER Anchorman film, but this was reaaaaallly bad. The kind of bad that makes you wish you could get that time back in your life, the kind of bad that makes you think \"what on Earth were they thinking to film this in the first place\", the kind of bad that makes you wish you'd taken 50 more minutes when stepping into the kitchen to grab a snack during the film, the kind of bad that makes leprosy look fun, the kind of bad that makes you think you wish you rented a Pauly Shore film instead....seriously, I cannot explain how very bad this was.<br /><br />Having said that....there were some semi-amusing laughs, but they are all so much LESS funny than Anchorman. Sure, they tried to make it entertaining and fun, but the entire subplot that was left out of Anchorman that made it here was genuinely left out for a good reason...it wasn't even a little bit good.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour (or in the USA, a favor), and don't watch this DVD...it will tarnish the good movie that Anchorman is and you don't want to do that.<br /><br />Okay...I'm alright

{"value":"For some reason, various young couples hiking through the Italian Alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first. James (Gregory Lee Kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of \"Tyranus\" when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse. He then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead \"Demonicus\" back to life. This shot-on-digital Full Moon release is stupid, senseless, has terrible acting and sound and the (Los) Angeles National Forest is a poor substitute for Italy. However, it's pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance. Whether bug-eyed running around in cheap-looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic Latin gibberish about demons and resurrection, Kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed.

this...","finished_norm":["i","realli","do","not","have","high","expect","and","i","must","admit","that","i","be","not","disappoint","thi","movi","be","so","terribl","that","i","feel","oblig","to","regist","a","account","here","at","imdb","just","to","warn","other","not","to","wast","their","time","the","storylin","be","terribl","and","you","keep","ask","yourself","throughout","the","movi","can","it","get","ani","wrong","ye","it","can","somehow","thei","manag","to","make","it","wrong","by","everi","minut","and","you","end","up","think","i","want","my","hour","minut","back","somebodi","get","to","pai","for","thi","br","br","i","dare","you","to","find","a","movi","which","be","wrong","that","thisbr","br","i","realli","do","not","have","high","expect","and","i","must","admit","that","i","be","not","disappoint","thi","movi","be","so","terribl","that","i","feel","oblig","to","regist","a","account","here","at","imdb","just","to","warn","other","not","to","wast","their","time","the","storylin","be","terribl","and","you","keep","ask","yourself","throughout","the","movi","can","it","get","ani","wrong","ye","it","can","somehow","thei","manag","to","make","it","wrong","by","everi","minut","and","you","end","up","think","i","want","my","hour","minut","back","somebodi","get","to","pai","for","thi","br","br","i","dare","you","to","find","a","movi","which","be","wrong","that","thi"],"filtered":["realli","high","expect","must","admit","disappoint","thi","movi","terribl","feel","oblig","regist","account","imdb","warn","wast","time","storylin","terribl","keep","ask","throughout","movi","get","ani","wrong","ye","somehow","thei","manag","make","wrong","everi","minut","end","think","want","hour","minut","back","somebodi","get","pai","thi","br","br","dare","find","movi","wrong","thisbr","br","realli","high","expect","must","admit","disappoint","thi","movi","terribl","feel","oblig","regist","account","imdb","warn","wast","time","storylin","terribl","keep","ask","throughout","movi","get","ani","wrong","ye","somehow","thei","manag","make","wrong","everi","minut","end","think","want","hour","minut","back","somebodi","get","pai","thi","br","br","dare","find","movi","wrong","thi"],"filtered2":["realli","high","expect","must","admit","disappoint","terribl","feel","oblig","regist","account","imdb","warn","wast","time","storylin","terribl","keep","ask","throughout","get","ani","wrong","ye","somehow","manag","make","wrong","everi","minut","end","think","want","hour","minut","back","somebodi","get","pai","dare","find","wrong","thisbr","realli","high","expect","must","admit","disappoint","terribl","feel","oblig","regist","account","imdb","warn","wast","time","storylin","terribl","keep","ask","throughout","get","ani","wrong","ye","somehow","manag","make","wrong","everi","minut","end","think","want","hour","minut","back","somebodi","get","pai","dare","find","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,8,12,13,24,25,27,37,38,43,59,63,85,89,130,134,141,166,174,187,209,211,306,322,345,438,515,527,549,591,691,1082,1267,1503,1741,3194,3375],"values":[2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,8,12,13,24,25,27,37,38,43,59,63,85,89,130,134,141,166,174,187,209,211,306,322,345,438,515,527,549,591,691,1082,1267,1503,1741,3194,3375],"values":[1.2399534312410465,3.1865361882879695,1.8837873718108231,2.133457220525776,2.2635883139467947,2.6420723132238515,7.67783272849621,2.600540117735859,2.975308642954861,3.038623282696244,3.321622407243643,7.477301779680289,3.745925514644013,4.022380438207478,3.9880092219144876,4.528427806839927,4.488792363340481,4.5315094715482385,9.769548131877414,4.912565156919632,4.946432381978511,5.2053793708887675,5.137432284239405,5.747897365194643,5.770689634656382,6.004465676314169,6.3594702170301805,6.791386000336851,6.879204985567988,6.894223829612251,7.018616245352062,7.185844525434329,8.33141152205447,4.3215761317340196,9.19456402627817,9.502865385932687,11.253802860640487,11.209845047202936]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.4288540209997082E-4,1.4275878412155294E-4,1.4279403236813821E-4,1.427653262000616E-4,1.4277883724474321E-4,1.427579969926851E-4,1.4280239671170367E-4,1.42736756931096E-4,1.4275881429216258E-4,1.429063400573346E-4,1.440402602713294E-4,1.4275905009280738E-4,1.4289425193469404E-4,1.4290913905042738E-4,1.4284421916000735E-4,1.4276588853201838E-4,1.428150055191138E-4,1.428822147462434E-4,1.4277325891928096E-4,1.4277273692608086E-4,1.4290118270662074E-4,1.4278704129672056E-4,1.4278725739253324E-4,1.4287872843841807E-4,1.427733104211905E-4,1.4291084716737306E-4,1.428090388893447E-4,1.427584641694959E-4,1.4282318475637782E-4,1.4286677645111568E-4,1.427877416902677E-4,1.4286421569529177E-4,1.4293435845861871E-4,1.430670237064802E-4,1.4280879211131056E-4,1.427658019422438E-4,1.428172770763972E-4,1.427803011426404E-4,1.4273690927612

{"value":"In a recent biography of Alec Guinness I couldn't find too much about To Paris With Love. I'm sure Guinness did the film to get a free trip to Paris out of it. The film has no other reason for existence.<br /><br />Paris of course is nicely photographed with that wonderful opening of Guinness and his son driving down the Champs Elysee with the Arc De Triomphe in the background. Unfortunately it goes downhill from there.<br /><br />There is just no chemistry at all between Guinness and the young girl who he has a brief fling with in Paris. According to the recent biography of Guinness by Piers Paul Read, Guinness positively disliked the girl, found her conduct unprofessional. As to what Odile Vernois thought of her co-star, no record is available. They have as much chemistry as two neutered cats.<br /><br />Guinness does have a good moment in the film which was straight from one of his Ealing comedies as he climbs a tree trying to retrieve a badminton shuttlecock.

{"value":"Uma Thurman plays Sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and freakishly large thumbs) who hitchhikes cross-country, eventually finding her true place amongst a group of peyote-enlightened cowgirls on a ranch devoted to preserving the Whooping Crane; Rain(bow) Phoenix is their lesbian leader, Bonanza Jellybean, who falls in love with Sissy, thumbs or not. Gus Van Sant directed and adapted Tom Robbins' book, but his satire has no primary target and just skitters all over the map, like Sissy (maybe that was his goal, but it's not involving for an audience). Notorious box-office flop wasn't so much panned as it was ignored, and one can see why: it's a series of sketches in search of a plot, and the performances, directorial touches and cinematography are all variable. Thurman is a stitch posing alongside the highway trying to get a ride, but this pretty much put the kibosh on Phoenix's career.

{"value":"I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes, although it's not much cop. Britain's greatest ever screen actor does not seem too interested in this role, which is a pity as he might have elevated it with more conviction in his playing. Rex Harrison seems even less bothered, perhaps unsurprisingly, as his character is very poorly written. William Holden is better, but his screen time is fleeting and, again, his character is not well scripted.<br /><br />Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, but is given very little to do, the film might have gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone. The music is poor and Omar Sharif makes one of his many pointless cameos (his career has been based on this for decades now).<br /><br />Richard Fleischer has to be blamed for not directing this more effectively, he was an infuriatingly unpredictable film director, and this is one of his weaker movies.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","recent","with","my","wife","and","discov","it","well","than","cain","believ","although","it","not","much","cop","britain","great","ever","screen","actor","doe","not","seem","too","interest","in","thi","role","which","be","a","piti","a","he","mai","have","elev","it","with","much","convict","in","hi","plai","rex","harrison","seem","even","littl","bother","perhap","unsurprisingli","a","hi","charact","be","veri","poorli","write","william","holden","be","well","but","hi","screen","time","be","fleet","and","again","hi","charact","be","not","good","scriptedbr","br","beverli","johnson","be","a","beauti","a","woman","a","i","have","ever","see","but","be","give","veri","littl","to","do","the","film","mai","have","gain","a","great","deal","by","concentr","much","on","her","stori","ustinov","steal","the","show","but","basic","by","plai","a","comic","charact","quit","out","of","keep","with","the","film","seriou","tone","the","music","be","poor","and","omar","sharif","make","on","of","hi","mani","pointless","cameo","hi","career","have","be","base","on","thi","for","decad","nowbr","br","richard","fleischer","have","to","be","blame","for","not","direct","thi","much","effect","he","be","a","infuriatingli","unpredict","film","director","and","thi","be","on","of","hi","weak","movi"],"filtered":["see","thi","recent","wife","discov","well","cain","believ","although","much","cop","britain","great","ever","screen","actor","doe","seem","interest","thi","role","piti","mai","elev","much","convict","hi","plai","rex","harrison","seem","even","littl","bother","perhap","unsurprisingli","hi","charact","veri","poorli","write","william","holden","well","hi","screen","time","fleet","hi","charact","good","scriptedbr","br","beverli","johnson","beauti","woman","ever","see","give","veri","littl","film","mai","gain","great","deal","concentr","much","stori","ustinov","steal","show","basic","plai","comic","charact","quit","keep","film","seriou","tone","music","poor","omar","sharif","make","hi","mani","pointless","cameo","hi","career","base","thi","decad","nowbr","br","richard","fleischer","blame","direct","thi","much","effect","infuriatingli","unpredict","film","director","thi","hi","weak","movi"],"filtered2":["see","recent","wife","discov","well","cain","believ","although","cop","britain","great","ever","screen","actor","doe","seem","interest","role","piti","mai","elev","convict","plai","rex","harrison","seem","even","littl","bother","perhap","unsurprisingli","charact","veri","poorli","write","william","holden","well","screen","time","fleet","charact","good","scriptedbr","beverli","johnson","beauti","woman","ever","see","give","veri","littl","mai","gain","great","deal","concentr","stori","ustinov","steal","show","basic","plai","comic","charact","quit","keep","seriou","tone","music","poor","omar","sharif","make","mani","pointless","cameo","career","base","decad","nowbr","richard","fleischer","blame","direct","effect","infuriatingli","unpredict","director","weak"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,8,10,14,15,17,18,20,28,30,35,40,41,44,46,50,51,58,60,65,70,91,102,106,118,120,128,134,146,192,237,263,286,318,325,334,379,398,468,476,480,493,496,511,531,562,578,641,720,783,898,967,1196,1199,1266,1755,1907,2143,2357,2507,2617,2997,3298,3788,3796,3931,4952,4965,4976,6492,7740],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,8,10,14,15,17,18,20,28,30,35,40,41,44,46,50,51,58,60,65,70,91,102,106,118,120,128,134,146,192,237,263,286,318,325,334,379,398,468,476,480,493,496,511,531,562,578,641,720,783,898,967,1196,1199,1266,1755,1907,2143,2357,2507,2617,2997,3298,3788,3796,3931,4952,4965,4976,6492,7740],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,3.3716610723085094,2.2350163994518417,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,2.926338025798268,3.2569937516641474,1.5687599167621034,3.209458785004948,3.311542587503466,1.717994385570355,3.4279798616619646,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,2.094675786251684,2.0105926690411424,2.087553710177271,2.159084361316692,2.354379525480895,2.2044500422972613,2.3409902041158843,2.2443961816702407,2.326138445979858,5.063653426867979,2.640097787510554,2.902686292364678,2.780700890737216,2.902686292364678,2.973659465713028,2.942840385588056,3.1272886331425473,3.143848349181566,3.304513710030018,3.6105180246075443,3.43462735814388,3.342254038012865,3.293679367864308,3.3909310864081816,3.4272107604888307,3.432149042129413,3.575630765607104,3.7034641371169887,3.857614816944247,3.7810747398219124,3.892300374932137,4.1

{"value":"If you like the standard Sly flicks that involve over the top action, unbelievable stunts (unbelievable is not intended to be complimentary here), and retarded dialogue; you will love this steaming pile of mountain goat dung. I had high hopes based on the trailer. I thought that Stalone was going to be forced in his \"has-been\" days to yield to smarter people and make an action film that would place a credible hero in a credible situation where the story, setting, and (believable) action would prevail. I crave action that is at least close enough to reality that you can imagine the fear and excitement that would come from such an event. My limited knowledge of hypothermia and its effects rendered at least one scene laughably ridiculous. Judge Dredd is only better because you know going into the theater that you are going to see a comic book made into a movie. The character, setting and everything else are beyond comparison to anything we might encounter ourselves.

{"value":"This early Pia Zadora vehicle followed a familiar Harold Robbins formula: ambitious main character wallows in decadence while pursuing the path to the top of some randomly chosen but glamorous world, in this case the movie industry. But despite being so formulaic as to be completely predictable, this movie manages at the same time to be completely unbelievable. Zadora (to call her inexperienced as an actress is to be charitable) never convinces as a screenwriter. One would expect a movie about movie-making to have some insights into its own industry and creative process. But the script gives her none of the qualities which make writers interesting movie characters: observance, skill with words, a love-hate relationship with one's own creative abilities. Her character is as empty as a donut hole. And this is just a taste of the incompetence on display here. The cinematography is so murky that it is sometimes hard to see what is happening. And the scenes never really hang together, so everything seems like a succession of random moments at bad Hollywood parties.

{"value":"First off - there's absolutely no flirting going on in this film - with Anthony or anyone else. These people don't flirt - they just do it. Your first test of endurance is to wade through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion. This wouldn't be so bad - hell, I like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer, but without a context to put it in, it is repellent. So you make it through the torture and mayhem. Then we meet Donna and the movie turns into something all together different - not better - just different: a road picture without heart. There are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos - broadly written and broadly played by broads like Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole (and a few hookers and drag queens, too). They all deserve better. The photography is purposely disorienting, so if you get motion sickness (or really ANY kind of sickness) - this flick is not for you. Come to think of it, I'm not sure just who this flick IS for -except maybe gay and bi-sexual S&M fans who like poorly scripted, poorly shot indy films about
