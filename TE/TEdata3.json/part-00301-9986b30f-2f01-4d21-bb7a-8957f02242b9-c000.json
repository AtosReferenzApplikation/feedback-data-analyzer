{"value":"Holy crap. This was the worst film I have seen in a long time. All the performances are fine, but there is no plot. Really! No plot! A bunch of clowns talk about this and that and that's your film. Ug... Robert Duvall's character is senile and keeps asking the same people the same qestions over and over. This earns him the same responses over and over. I am pretty sure this film got upto a six because people think they should like it. Good performances with famous and well regarded actors, but the actual complete work is a steamy turd. Well, maybe that's a bit deceptive since steam rising from a fresh pile sounds a little like something happening and in this film NOTHING HAPPENS!

{"value":"This is one of the most atrocious rewrites I've ever viewed. If they want to make a movie with a lousy story, they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book. There is hardly a relation between Wolfe's book and this movie other than the title. I don't mind changes if they help a story flow on screen. At least the changes shouldn't hurt the final product. The last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing. The actors are miscast. The director and/or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon.<br /><br />If you've seen this movie and disliked it, try the book. If you've seen this movie and liked it, read the book.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","much","atroci","rewrit","i","have","ever","view","if","thei","want","to","make","a","movi","with","a","lousi","stori","thei","should","refrain","from","give","it","a","titl","of","a","fine","book","there","be","hardli","a","relat","between","wolf","book","and","thi","movi","other","than","the","titl","i","do","not","mind","chang","if","thei","help","a","stori","flow","on","screen","at","littl","the","chang","should","not","hurt","the","final","product","the","last","scene","in","the","movi","be","painfulli","unconvinc","the","actor","be","miscast","the","director","andor","screen","writer","obvious","can","not","decid","whether","to","make","a","lame","comedi","or","preach","a","unconvinc","sermonbr","br","if","you","have","see","thi","movi","and","dislik","it","try","the","book","if","you","have","see","thi","movi","and","like","it","read","the","book"],"filtered":["thi","much","atroci","rewrit","ever","view","thei","want","make","movi","lousi","stori","thei","refrain","give","titl","fine","book","hardli","relat","wolf","book","thi","movi","titl","mind","chang","thei","help","stori","flow","screen","littl","chang","hurt","final","product","last","scene","movi","painfulli","unconvinc","actor","miscast","director","andor","screen","writer","obvious","decid","whether","make","lame","comedi","preach","unconvinc","sermonbr","br","see","thi","movi","dislik","try","book","see","thi","movi","like","read","book"],"filtered2":["atroci","rewrit","ever","view","want","make","lousi","stori","refrain","give","titl","fine","book","hardli","relat","wolf","book","titl","mind","chang","help","stori","flow","screen","littl","chang","hurt","final","product","last","scene","painfulli","unconvinc","actor","miscast","director","andor","screen","writer","obvious","decid","whether","make","lame","comedi","preach","unconvinc","sermonbr","see","dislik","try","book","see","like","read","book"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,14,17,19,30,36,37,41,44,58,127,144,145,151,156,185,190,192,238,249,264,278,287,312,341,372,464,597,665,863,903,1117,1219,1240,1398,1515,1541,1857,1899,2114,2442,3189,6712],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,14,17,19,30,36,37,41,44,58,127,144,145,151,156,185,190,192,238,249,264,278,287,312,341,372,464,597,665,863,903,1117,1219,1240,1398,1515,1541,1857,1899,2114,2442,3189,6712],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.1175081997259209,2.5541073880211935,1.312380678011735,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.865701314626681,2.4359679371086367,2.2931108769894046,2.34599021453259,11.200981947240745,2.3451551414151686,2.518833027372001,2.558331832813986,5.063653426867979,2.597304642813496,2.6754694156628323,5.51548139691143,5.667386841755453,2.841890188081905,2.8824835850471584,2.933776879434709,3.070535816550098,3.2872346624216657,3.4986697244709752,3.5929222627171646,3.944626193933877,3.948766986599908,4.224077767249142,4.246178114249808,4.3095999406873045,8.872703292652895,4.605250182788262,4.605250182788262,5.143104478942172,4.828393734102471,4.9676558014359795,5.1994574154933035,5.583416318380505,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.780574282022985E-5,7.728108050689524E-5,7.788186721652809E-5,7.743186495804768E-5,7.743313359197646E-5,7.732489754531163E-5,7.755487262483217E-5,7.729220847751854E-5,7.746598953852786E-5,0.3259479882692222,0.6679803521066765,7.716744181198617E-5,7.860773384629829E-5,7.972909044256699E-5,7.722371150555246E-5,7.701029848584534E-5,7.893122404959548E-5,7.756213893098838E-5,7.732150269710255E-5,7.738558847530935E-5,7.813433943136817E-5,7.763898338376247E-5,7.772738714467772E-5,7.781112968649127E-5,7.840829013160877E-5,7.799823684784346E-5,8.127713455005563E-5,7.71903829848914E-5,7.719244800840667E-5,7.738801463891146E-5,7.903287877333121E-5,7.755764486736083E-5,8.325156172353614E-5,7.777580307745547E-5,7.727440124542777E-5,7.76310735469852E-5,7.719697036430669E-5,7.724258809404903E-5,7.70099115798792E-5,7.702989150385701E-5,7.720327642795819E-5,7.801760740525467E-5,7.762116715656198E-5,7.731427475977052E-5,7.82537242670697E-5,7.734394840090521E-5,7.991370373120272E-5,7.873854942432697E-5,7.704903764296157E-5,7.721932072802455E-5,7.719253815834498E-5,7.93650263521292E-5,7.72204696043049E-5,7.702305300970898E-5,7.786849124497155E-5,7.724035954734632E-5,8.306351775808315E-5,7.717670345466269E-5,7.704814661504286E-5,7.741602890149909E-5,7.81839308447049E-5,7.741090739083759E-5,7.703389253566837E-5,7.72132541561341E-5,7.701084302839177E-5,7.879271431636231E-5,7.767425529060535E-5,7.75087977543246E-5,7.744101280764135E-5,7.772329760927293E-5,7.700803355070283E-5,7.744263632219799E-5,7.869870447346779E-5,7.714603

{"value":"Don't waste 90 minutes of your time on \"Fast Food, Fast Women.\" It's annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing, horrific acting, and even bad music. I found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen. SHE needs the fast food.<br /><br />Spend the 90 minutes you'd devote to this turkey doing something more exciting...like trimming your toenails. You'd have more entertainment value.<br /><br />The only redeeming thing about this film is Louise Lasser, but she deserves much better than this tired script.

{"value":"This movie started out good, i felt like i was watching an adult version of Seinfeld. Much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters, and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing. All the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny. Dan Cortese was amazing. I loved him in this role. His agent should show this movie to casting agents. Watch the first few scenes and then find something better, or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess. I found this in a bin at a video store. It cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good

{"value":"I missed the first 10 or so minutes of the movie but don't think watching it from the beginning would've made any difference. I found the film extremely boring and was disappointed with the acting. I remember Patrick Swayze and some of the other actors (Roy Marsden, for instance) in outstanding roles but they all disappointed here due to a very weak script. \"Kind Solomon's Mines\"...the very short part of the movie inside the \"mines\" was about as exciting as watching paint dry and I doubt that even a pre-school kid would've been spell-bound by watching the fight of the \"warriors\". The entire movie was reminiscent of a cheaply produced American TV series.

{"value":"Wow, what a total let down! The fact people think this film is scary is ridiculous. The special effects were a direct rip-off of \"The ring.\" The story? Was there one? Not in my opinion..Just a bunch of flashy imaging. The entire film was a boring, stupid, mess. I guess there is always a market for bad films with good marketing campaigns. However, this is the worst horror film I have seen in years. And that Buffy chick? Well, she's a bad actress! As plastic as Barbie and just as talented..No, wait, that would be an insult to the talents of Barbie!

{"value":"\"Freddy's Dead\" did the smartest thing it could've done after the disappointment of the fifth film. It started from scratch. Sure, this \"final\" film in the saga is silly but at least it's original. Some of the visuals are even a bit breath-taking. And the story of Freddy's kid (Lisa Zane) returning to town to face her evil father is unique.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is nothing but another cartoon made to get kids in the theater. It has a bunch of good actors (Zane, Yaphet Kotto, and Lezlie Deane) who basically look dumb and wander around like sheep ready for slaughter. It's one-sided, it's a magic-trick, and, in the end, it's nothing but goofy, childish entertainment.<br /><br

{"value":"This HAS to be the worst movie I've ever attempted to watch. In the first 15 minutes, there wasn't anything to keep my interest in this movie. I was on vacation at the time, and had plenty of time to devote to a just-for-the-fun-of-it movie. The condo we were staying in had this movie in stock -- they must have got it from the $1 store or something.<br /><br />If you like Adam Sandler, this is nothing like any other movie he's made. This started with a bad premise and then just got worse. There's nothing even remotely funny in it.<br /><br />I've watched a lot of movies, including some I didn't care for. But if you decide to waste your time on this movie, don't say I didn't warn you.","finished_norm":["thi","have","to","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","attempt","to","watch","in","the","minut","there","be","not","anyth","to","keep","my","interest","in","thi","movi","i","be","on","vacat","at","the","time","and","have","plenti","of","time","to","devot","to","a","justforthefunofit","movi","the","condo","we","be","stai","in","have","thi","movi","in","stock","thei","must","have","get","it","from","the","store","or","somethingbr","br","if","you","like","adam","sandler","thi","be","noth","like","ani","other","movi","he","make","thi","start","with","a","bad","premis","and","then","just","get","wrong","there","noth","even","remot","funni","in","itbr","br","i","have","watch","a","lot","of","movi","includ","some","i","do","not","care","for","but","if","you","decid","to","wast","your","time","on","thi","movi","do","not","sai","i","do","not","warn","you"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","movi","ever","attempt","watch","minut","anyth","keep","interest","thi","movi","vacat","time","plenti","time","devot","justforthefunofit","movi","condo","stai","thi","movi","stock","thei","must","get","store","somethingbr","br","like","adam","sandler","thi","noth","like","ani","movi","make","thi","start","bad","premis","get","wrong","noth","even","remot","funni","itbr","br","watch","lot","movi","includ","care","decid","wast","time","thi","movi","sai","warn"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","attempt","watch","minut","anyth","keep","interest","vacat","time","plenti","time","devot","justforthefunofit","condo","stai","stock","must","get","store","somethingbr","like","adam","sandler","noth","like","ani","make","start","bad","premis","get","wrong","noth","even","remot","funni","itbr","watch","lot","includ","care","decid","wast","time","warn"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,7,8,9,25,27,44,49,59,60,62,71,72,89,104,134,141,177,205,249,301,365,431,484,527,793,883,887,1233,1251,2346,2694,2840,3503],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,7,8,9,25,27,44,49,59,60,62,71,72,89,104,134,141,177,205,249,301,365,431,484,527,793,883,887,1233,1251,2346,2694,2840,3503],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,2.825681057716235,1.0683570856722073,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.604729392502474,3.3840606616174704,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,2.0226120445069267,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,1.9940046109572438,2.0728240170322856,2.2443961816702407,2.2657547357741192,2.458149992634611,2.571852579609833,2.6754694156628323,2.8309760279012264,3.008694896185175,3.1419947805322432,3.291526514503207,3.439602492783994,3.770603439954617,3.8614098879127985,3.9323057095458362,4.364659717870332,4.637773374493822,5.274680836730892,5.878215858601149,5.3560264761848435,5.626901430320244]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1843347047162975E-4,1.1763484589275438E-4,1.185493446489638E-4,1.1786436527263361E-4,1.1786629634755815E-4,1.1770154281945081E-4,1.1805160369930818E-4,1.1765178454191384E-4,1.1791630864272644E-4,1.3082170764143852E-4,0.8767627881337038,1.1746186862230991E-4,1.1965423615114836E-4,1.2136113012219116E-4,1.1754752059155887E-4,1.1722266996162346E-4,1.2014664283028747E-4,1.1806266424348393E-4,1.1769637528758808E-4,1.177939246566423E-4,1.1893364996522118E-4,1.181796344682854E-4,1.1831419991073775E-4,1.184416701911258E-4,1.1935064916080232E-4,1.1872647886547049E-4,1.237175144898161E-4,1.174967889588477E-4,1.1749993227311544E-4,1.1779761768706542E-4,1.2030137847428323E-4,1.1805582352025915E-4,1.2672292583701023E-4,1.1838789713072622E-4,1.1762467892966006E-4,1.1816759436190711E-4,1.1750681606195329E-4,1.1757625394471866E-4,1.1722208102545173E-4,1.1725249384140436E-4,1.1751641495499374E-4,1.1875596412267677E-4,1.1815251516395668E-4,1.1768537314723758E-4,1.1911537383162634E-4,1.1773054143654023E-4,1.2164214270141462E-4,1.198533595363397E-4,1.1728163749607682E-4,1.1754083708720752E-4,1.1750006949653458E-4,1.208069631398867E-4,1.1754258587078175E-4,1.1724208449929934E-4,1.1852898416302858E-4,1.1757286172056471E-4,1.2643669118873624E-4,1.1747596640538722E-4,1.1728028120122152E-4,1.1784026012219547E-4,1.190091364649855E-4,1.1783246431870189E-4,1.1725858408700464E-4,1.1753160274104219E-4,1.1722349884727193E-4,1.1993580764246842E-4,1.1823332426271621E-4,0.11398228107412393,1.1787828984343598E-4,1.183079749477331E-4,1.172192223481235E-4,1.1788076110656303E-4,1.1979270879720429E-4,1.1742928570562005E-4,1.2033559934229517E-4,1.1773975680682112E-4,1.186612471819782E-4,1.1793604184006791E-4,1.171824706695396E-4,1.1732772639009477E-4]}}
{"value":"This is one of the worst film adaptations of a musical ever made. The stage version of A Chorus Line is wonderful. This movie misses the mark in almost every way. Even the casting is baffling. Take Audrey Landers as Val. \"Dance 10 Looks 3\" is Val's song. Val's story is that she is a great dancer but a 3 in the looks department. Yes, she finds a solution, but ultimately she's a great dancer. What do the brilliant filmmakers do? They hire an actress who can't dance and is famous for looking great. Way to miss the boat.<br /><br />Then there's the choreography. I'm sure Michael Bennett was turning over in his grave. Why didn't they use his choreography? It really can't be improved upon.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","film","adapt","of","a","music","ever","make","the","stage","version","of","a","choru","line","be","wonder","thi","movi","miss","the","mark","in","almost","everi","wai","even","the","cast","be","baffl","take","audrei","lander","a","val","danc","look","be","val","song","val","stori","be","that","she","be","a","great","dancer","but","a","in","the","look","depart","ye","she","find","a","solut","but","ultim","she","a","great","dancer","what","do","the","brilliant","filmmak","do","thei","hire","a","actress","who","ca","not","danc","and","be","famou","for","look","great","wai","to","miss","the","boatbr","br","then","there","the","choreographi","i","be","sure","michael","bennett","be","turn","over","in","hi","grave","why","do","not","thei","us","hi","choreographi","it","realli","ca","not","be","improv","upon"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","film","adapt","music","ever","make","stage","version","choru","line","wonder","thi","movi","miss","mark","almost","everi","wai","even","cast","baffl","take","audrei","lander","val","danc","look","val","song","val","stori","great","dancer","look","depart","ye","find","solut","ultim","great","dancer","brilliant","filmmak","thei","hire","actress","ca","danc","famou","look","great","wai","miss","boatbr","br","choreographi","sure","michael","bennett","turn","hi","grave","thei","us","hi","choreographi","realli","ca","improv","upon"],"filtered2":["wrong","adapt","music","ever","make","stage","version","choru","line","wonder","miss","mark","almost","everi","wai","even","cast","baffl","take","audrei","lander","val","danc","look","val","song","val","stori","great","dancer","look","depart","ye","find","solut","ultim","great","dancer","brilliant","filmmak","hire","actress","ca","danc","famou","look","great","wai","miss","boatbr","choreographi","sure","michael","bennett","turn","grave","us","choreographi","realli","ca","improv","upon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,13,16,17,25,31,33,38,44,51,56,81,85,92,96,107,118,119,131,175,209,220,255,323,328,354,466,492,630,669,701,717,735,865,912,1014,1116,1444,1739,2062,3134,3395,3420,3536,4141,4739,7468],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,13,16,17,25,31,33,38,44,51,56,81,85,92,96,107,118,119,131,175,209,220,255,323,328,354,466,492,630,669,701,717,735,865,912,1014,1116,1444,1739,2062,3134,3395,3420,3536,4141,4739,7468],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.926017105726131,1.1317941569733974,3.589841616087325,1.2770536940105968,1.2796387880827016,1.4070669811451506,2.803707089537043,1.519311641348122,1.604729392502474,5.141969792492947,1.8610609350701788,3.899514464849456,2.011190219103739,2.0489535369135887,2.0390708128715254,2.1439533986393955,2.354379525480895,2.1653408989309972,2.2512118082053005,2.3791142619576227,2.6026896854443837,2.8336934208777267,5.3509388313256645,3.0433232530252132,3.1550424959247185,3.0316467233633775,3.4446025032006995,7.2033628856140925,3.558633189238533,3.7099788181381825,3.8240921249056035,3.7398317812878634,3.7132521434831514,3.9201351739255808,3.9405024767500145,4.1302590120314875,4.181290492043933,4.573751515728891,4.733083554298147,10.612859070090943,6.032366538428407,5.5623629091826725,11.591955520728355,5.7446844659766265,6.101359409915359,6.437831646536572,20.845971810907688]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.401730713239557E-5,6.358562346437715E-5,6.407994105479577E-5,6.370968647271469E-5,6.371073028419844E-5,6.362167541509774E-5,6.381089519200391E-5,6.359477937867511E-5,6.373776362576511E-5,0.11843015903867575,0.17874530939825053,6.349212338365782E-5,6.467717238105559E-5,6.559980645697635E-5,6.353842117768572E-5,6.336282839579804E-5,0.4265145116171051,6.381687379121857E-5,6.361888218888344E-5,6.367161093097338E-5,6.428767111088119E-5,6.388010016444433E-5,6.395283734950337E-5,6.402173935885391E-5,6.451307331746328E-5,6.417568810583302E-5,6.687351211791412E-5,6.351099900978281E-5,6.35126980777413E-5,6.367360713915595E-5,6.502697475274595E-5,6.381317614833144E-5,6.84980388712579E-5,6.399267319614383E-5,6.358012787604032E-5,6.387359207864008E-5,6.351641899905276E-5,6.355395252948052E-5,6.336251005582507E-5,6.337894921421373E-5,6.352160752626092E-5,0.1709083442293662,6.386544126077872E-5,6.361293515891694E-5,6.438589902333379E-5,6.36373501510422E-5,6.57517032858084E-5,6.478480532346851E-5,6.339470234789036E-5,6.353480851693132E-5,6.35127722516529E-5,6.530026041000548E-5,6.353575379375832E-5,6.337332261180201E-5,6.406893552167842E-5,6.355211891728745E-5,0.08625242790874069,6.34997437134983E-5,6.33939692245261E-5,6.36966568214436E-5,6.432847412391896E-5,6.369244292528227E-5,6.338224119849446E-5,6.352981703967174E-5,6.336327643660039E-5,6.48293713208298E-5,6.390912131907457E-5,6.377298553354614E-5,6.371721317544655E-5,6.39494725

{"value":"I saw this for Gary Busey and Fred Williamson thinking they were buddy cops. They are but Busey is in the opening scene then doesn't show up again until like 40 minutes into the movie. Though every scene he's in is awesome. Especially when he disguises himself as a blind hobo.<br /><br />What's incredible about this movie is the plot. In the movie Fred Williamson is trying to find out who stalking and killing phone sex operators. At one point I think thats its Busey. But it turns out I'm only partly right. Busey is not the killer, but he is calling up and harassing the women over the phone. Why? I don't know. In no way is he connected to the killer, he just does it for kicks I guess.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","for","gari","busei","and","fred","williamson","think","thei","be","buddi","cop","thei","be","but","busei","be","in","the","open","scene","then","doe","not","show","up","again","until","like","minut","into","the","movi","though","everi","scene","he","in","be","awesom","especi","when","he","disguis","himself","a","a","blind","hobobr","br","what","incred","about","thi","movi","be","the","plot","in","the","movi","fred","williamson","be","try","to","find","out","who","stalk","and","kill","phone","sex","oper","at","on","point","i","think","that","it","busei","but","it","turn","out","i","be","onli","partli","right","busei","be","not","the","killer","but","he","be","call","up","and","harass","the","woman","over","the","phone","why","i","do","not","know","in","no","wai","be","he","connect","to","the","killer","he","just","doe","it","for","kick","i","guess"],"filtered":["see","thi","gari","busei","fred","williamson","think","thei","buddi","cop","thei","busei","open","scene","doe","show","like","minut","movi","though","everi","scene","awesom","especi","disguis","blind","hobobr","br","incred","thi","movi","plot","movi","fred","williamson","try","find","stalk","kill","phone","sex","oper","point","think","busei","turn","onli","partli","right","busei","killer","call","harass","woman","phone","know","wai","connect","killer","doe","kick","guess"],"filtered2":["see","gari","busei","fred","williamson","think","buddi","cop","busei","open","scene","doe","show","like","minut","though","everi","scene","awesom","especi","disguis","blind","hobobr","incred","plot","fred","williamson","try","find","stalk","kill","phone","sex","oper","point","think","busei","turn","onli","partli","right","busei","killer","call","harass","woman","phone","know","wai","connect","killer","doe","kick","guess"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,11,12,18,19,26,28,32,33,36,38,59,66,70,76,85,86,96,121,142,242,243,252,254,267,476,767,869,983,1302,1418,1420,1493,1496,1679,1726,1842,2276,3075,4819,5058],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,11,12,18,19,26,28,32,33,36,38,59,66,70,76,85,86,96,121,142,242,243,252,254,267,476,767,869,983,1302,1418,1420,1493,1496,1679,1726,1842,2276,3075,4819,5058],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,2.430631986809635,2.62476135602347,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.8693254449200722,1.929723173391612,2.094675786251684,2.1337665533324026,2.011190219103739,2.031112399272319,2.0390708128715254,2.2190595059394194,2.2844323215331563,2.689504733779216,2.627841366673578,6.0866465060504265,2.889652074525771,2.7085302779237206,3.6105180246075443,3.79165684915245,3.9161110236258554,8.33141152205447,4.4919214974812585,4.550761997504193,4.573751515728891,4.605250182788262,9.935311602871959,4.706176101378222,4.911775343041523,4.890269137820559,5.064116067623542,5.583416318380505,6.1754673820690815,26.172768648777595]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.722934171683949E-5,7.670856621089662E-5,7.73049021677986E-5,7.685823361951635E-5,7.68594928551415E-5,7.675205864359145E-5,7.69803300199561E-5,7.671961174320222E-5,7.689210539801654E-5,8.530759356445039E-5,0.6260975121320449,7.659576937504267E-5,7.802539142680992E-5,7.913844078050301E-5,7.665162221103157E-5,7.643979019930122E-5,7.834648514749084E-5,7.698754249580708E-5,7.674868894512301E-5,7.681229996257398E-5,7.75555040160316E-5,7.70638176689141E-5,7.715156651640666E-5,7.723468867607678E-5,0.06515061665522962,7.742040970871472E-5,8.067501665570814E-5,7.661854059497404E-5,7.662059032036619E-5,0.22818965143968897,7.844738679191901E-5,7.698308172513632E-5,8.263481686259073E-5,7.719962377389819E-5,7.670193643078542E-5,7.705596642985056E-5,7.662507917371438E-5,7.667035895783981E-5,7.643940615961484E-5,7.64592380681659E-5,7.663133852073657E-5,7.743963676501329E-5,7.704613342802521E-5,7.674151455385202E-5,7.767400442407354E-5,7.677096836648984E-5,7.932168641555159E-5,7.815523789586564E-5,7.647824236869524E-5,7.664726396129557E-5,7.662067980245505E-5,0.0746836518781129,7.664840432646181E-5,7.64524502350029E-5,7.72916252882176E-5,7.666814692067396E-5,8.244816596589135E-5,7.660496240554656E-5,7.647735794169643E-5,7.68425148797639E-5,7.7604728045878E-5,7.683743131031714E-5,7.646320945950257E-5,7.664124233182973E-5,7.644033070776336E-5,7.820900152313051E-5,7.709882827414496E-5,7.69345964816592E-5,7.686731369994019E-5,7.714750727712956E-5,7.643754204326868E-5,7.686892518716379E-5,7.811568812467837E-5,7.657452236440327E-5,7.846970189506526E-5,7.67769776219616E-5,7.737787274720267E-5,7.690497322866089E-5,7.641357662257535E-5,7.650829649892794E-5]}}
{"value":"Clearly rips off Hideo Nakata's Ringu (Ring, 1998) and Hongurai Mizu no Soko Kara (Dark Water, 2002), with hints of Ju-On (The Grudge, 2000), but atrociously done gore (a green corpse with red eyes!?) weak story, and a weak theme (I find it very difficult to find a picture message scary). There were two moments in this film that made me shudder, both involving an unexpected hand, and after Oodishon (another Miike Takashi one, this one from 1999) had me tingling all over for hours after seeing it, and all of the films this steals from were actually scary, I can't see this film as anything other than a sell-out to the western popularity of the big Japanese horror films.

{"value":"Let me being by saying the I followed watching this video by watching Saw and after Bleed, Saw looked like the all time greatest horror flick ever even though I thought it was only fairly good. Bleed is pretty bad. The best part is seeing the female cast nude. The gore is very fake looking and over-done. It has its funny parts but its extremely predictable and I didn't want to stay to see the horrible ending. If I could, I would ban these actors and actresses, the only reason being is that Debbie Rochon (Maddy) has been in over a hundred other videos and I've also seen two other members of the cast in equally or worse motion pictures. They should not allowed to continue this

film, it is a waste of time.<br /><br />Emraan can act but was really pathetic In this film, i am actually ashamed to be one of his fans especially in this movie, it was just really bad.<br /><br

{"value":"\"Ask the Dust\" looked intriguing from the trailer, and we especially like all of the actors. Unfortunately, the movie was not compelling enough to be considered drama, and it wasn't funny enough to be a comedy. It practically seemed to satirize itself, and to no entertaining effect. After seventy minutes of waiting for this thing to get better, my wife and I walked out, valuing not having wasted any more time on such nonsense. It simply was not interesting, moving, funny nor artistic. It appears as though it were written, produced and directed by a high school kid; worse yet, it was such a shameful waste of otherwise extraordinarily talented actors, not to mention our time and money.","finished_norm":["ask","the","dust","look","intrigu","from","the","trailer","and","we","especi","like","all","of","the","actor","unfortun","the","movi","be","not","compel","enough","to","be","consid","drama","and","it","be","not","funni","enough","to","be","a","comedi","it","practic","seem","to","satir","itself","and","to","no","entertain","effect","after","seventi","minut","of","wait","for","thi","thing","to","get","well","my","wife","and","i","walk","out","valu","not","have","wast","ani","much","time","on","such","nonsens","it","simpli","be","not","interest","move","funni","nor","artist","it","appear","a","though","it","be","write","produc","and","direct","by","a","high","school","kid","wrong","yet","it","be","such","a","shame","wast","of","otherwis","extraordinarili","talent","actor","not","to","mention","our","time","and","monei"],"filtered":["ask","dust","look","intrigu","trailer","especi","like","actor","unfortun","movi","compel","enough","consid","drama","funni","enough","comedi","practic","seem","satir","entertain","effect","seventi","minut","wait","thi","thing","get","well","wife","walk","valu","wast","ani","much","time","nonsens","simpli","interest","move","funni","artist","appear","though","write","produc","direct","high","school","kid","wrong","yet","shame","wast","otherwis","extraordinarili","talent","actor","mention","time","monei"],"filtered2":["ask","dust","look","intrigu","trailer","especi","like","actor","unfortun","compel","enough","consid","drama","funni","enough","comedi","practic","seem","satir","entertain","effect","seventi","minut","wait","thing","get","well","wife","walk","valu","wast","ani","time","nonsens","simpli","interest","move","funni","artist","appear","though","write","produc","direct","high","school","kid","wrong","yet","shame","wast","otherwis","extraordinarili","talent","actor","mention","time","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,8,16,20,25,27,29,35,41,59,60,62,65,86,89,93,102,106,114,126,127,169,194,195,201,211,227,261,263,267,275,276,285,294,296,306,317,331,451,463,574,627,724,905,917,950,1017,1254,1279,2818,3065,6736],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,8,16,20,25,27,29,35,41,59,60,62,65,86,89,93,102,106,114,126,127,169,194,195,201,211,227,261,263,267,275,276,285,294,296,306,317,331,451,463,574,627,724,905,917,950,1017,1254,1279,2818,3065,6736],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,1.8837873718108231,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.463169012899134,3.1375198335242067,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,4.045224089013853,1.9073850067444174,2.031112399272319,3.9880092219144876,4.070779654240196,2.087553710177271,2.159084361316692,2.4433074195966826,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.4214486257841834,2.5378812223426954,2.51289241584188,2.561435818751577,2.5687161421197025,2.6005321873043625,2.7085302779237206,2.902686292364678,2.7085302779237206,2.7832848715031413,2.7884729505849193,2.808171552082607,2.886778509330039,2.9504565686333644,2.8739486825973213,2.8529247828056143,2.932274249550174,3.216957819005698,3.3467891931782563,3.5039747767006686,3.477726550625732,3.7987743169213135,3.9121030022283168,3.9363956947973615,4.125296222689358,4.0536665665501035,4.34596758485818,4.535724120139652,5.408212229355414,5.5623629091826725,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.106661873995611E-5,8.051996757796424E-5,8.114593354613664E-5,8.067707147763048E-5,8.06783932806144E-5,8.056562100943166E-5,8.080523445460186E-5,8.053156192716224E-5,8.071262623561075E-5,0.10678013395443918,0.8868937402606937,8.04015662309636E-5,8.19022215937631E-5,8.307057478166703E-5,8.046019421431814E-5,8.02378369528148E-5,8.223926942630414E-5,8.081280529512676E-5,8.056208388150934E-5,8.06288555253525E-5,8.140898699233484E-5,8.089287033569467E-5,8.098497914054026E-5,8.107223137236074E-5,8.169441909753641E-5,8.126718028439538E-5,8.468349815860043E-5,8.042546887940502E-5,8.042762044904415E-5,8.063138337063234E-5,8.234518454816398E-5,8.080812288314171E-5,8.674067451989003E-5,8.103542420823278E-5,8.051300838545194E-5,8.088462899387237E-5,8.043233233904435E-5,8.047986192967302E-5,8.023743383143445E-5,8.025825112358863E-5,8.04389026928416E-5,8.128736267113853E-5,8.08743074218853E-5,8.055455301786441E-5,8.153337530363868E-5,8.058547029550098E-5,8.326292530158613E-5,8.203851971527581E-5,8.027819968654649E-5,8.04556194172026E-5,8.042771437720952E-5,8.269125259095652E-5,8.045681644343772E-5,8.025112602487793E-5,8.113199698121038E-5,8.04775399835114E-5,8.654474954184633E-5,8.041121603351736E-5,8.027727131522126E-5,8.066057172437275E-5,8.146065680553917E-5,8.065523556874826E-5,8.026241984055812E-5,8.044929859238072E-5,8.023840431739997E-5,8.209495468385988E

{"value":"The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh. I had high hopes as I usually love bad campy holiday horror movies, but this just didn't qualify. It's really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity, which again, isn't a bad plot, but is done poorly here. There are some scenes (such as the ending) which are not intended to be funny, but actually made me laugh out loud. There were a couple of times when I thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction, but it never fulfills what it could and should be. In my opinion, if you are looking for a Christmas slasher flick, try Silent Night, Deadly Night.","finished_norm":["the","onli","reason","to","give","thi","movi","even","a","singl","star","be","how","much","the","end","make","me","laugh","i","have","high","hope","a","i","usual","love","bad","campi","holidai","horror","movi","but","thi","just","do","not","qualifi","it","realli","just","a","bad","attempt","at","show","a","charact","slide","slowli","into","insan","which","again","be","not","a","bad","plot","but","be","do","poorli","here","there","be","some","scene","such","a","the","end","which","be","not","intend","to","be","funni","but","actual","make","me","laugh","out","loud","there","be","a","coupl","of","time","when","i","think","the","movi","would","actual","go","in","a","interest","direct","but","it","never","fulfil","what","it","can","and","should","be","in","my","opinion","if","you","be","look","for","a","christma","slasher","flick","try","silent","night","deadli","night"],"filtered":["onli","reason","give","thi","movi","even","singl","star","much","end","make","laugh","high","hope","usual","love","bad","campi","holidai","horror","movi","thi","qualifi","realli","bad","attempt","show","charact","slide","slowli","insan","bad","plot","poorli","scene","end","intend","funni","actual","make","laugh","loud","coupl","time","think","movi","actual","go","interest","direct","never","fulfil","opinion","look","christma","slasher","flick","try","silent","night","deadli","night"],"filtered2":["onli","reason","give","even","singl","star","end","make","laugh","high","hope","usual","love","bad","campi","holidai","horror","qualifi","realli","bad","attempt","show","charact","slide","slowli","insan","bad","plot","poorli","scene","end","intend","funni","actual","make","laugh","loud","coupl","time","think","actual","go","interest","direct","never","fulfil","opinion","look","christma","slasher","flick","try","silent","night","deadli","night"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,16,19,24,28,30,32,36,42,52,54,60,62,83,95,100,102,133,177,181,210,211,253,257,265,398,443,538,731,748,926,956,1225,1285,1374,1733,1944,2031,2469,3261,3371],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,16,19,24,28,30,32,36,42,52,54,60,62,83,95,100,102,133,177,181,210,211,253,257,265,398,443,538,731,748,926,956,1225,1285,1374,1733,1944,2031,2469,3261,3371],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,3.205071257016622,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,2.6420723132238515,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.6219954307453837,3.4244306149452273,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,2.0226120445069267,2.292318797740072,2.0323326556775485,2.1405462403177813,2.087553710177271,4.642472950759303,2.458149992634611,2.4442286541160034,5.374303583034378,2.5687161421197025,2.7073305177318163,2.7602659523229094,2.73529586597515,3.143848349181566,3.239158528985891,3.43462735814388,4.096025840389245,4.246178114249808,3.9323057095458362,3.969732115064953,4.470719289830655,4.449957298382227,4.416284083275639,4.798834931860927,4.900964426937307,5.156897801074508,5.129498826886393,5.541743621979936,5.604922523601468]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.894622662171002E-5,8.834644142166952E-5,8.90332507610493E-5,8.851881568964897E-5,8.852026597078298E-5,8.839653232868497E-5,8.865943600133086E-5,8.83591627319613E-5,8.855782634051796E-5,9.825007414354088E-5,0.8915057740376728,8.821653156226837E-5,8.986304937755824E-5,9.114496552307869E-5,8.828085813681757E-5,8.803688793453121E-5,9.023285797894715E-5,8.86677427212547E-5,8.839265139487203E-5,8.846591318693258E-5,8.932187278331744E-5,8.875559001713949E-5,8.885665172116753E-5,8.89523847973138E-5,8.963504865162164E-5,8.916628258137104E-5,9.29146637100522E-5,8.824275752824766E-5,8.824511822866527E-5,8.846868673667006E-5,9.034906796251426E-5,8.866260518272117E-5,9.517179593245783E-5,8.891200000746177E-5,8.833880580143614E-5,8.874654762375012E-5,8.825028811045248E-5,8.83024375377384E-5,8.803644563008814E-5,8.805928634571655E-5,8.825749709717129E-5,8.918842667931081E-5,8.873522280355501E-5,8.838438853754765E-5,8.945835153497E-5,8.841831094884261E-5,0.10154631195364984,9.00125955630612E-5,8.808117389239367E-5,8.827583867322933E-5,8.824522128657016E-5,9.072877353108493E-5,8.827715204941838E-5,8.805146869334032E-5,8.901795957360954E-5,8.82998899003421E-5,9.495682717890505E-5,8.822711931760024E-5,8.808015528414817E-5,8.85007121741049E-5,8.937856485936807E-5,8.849485734859419E-5,8.806386025850647E-5,8.826890346949465E-5,8.803751044648191E-5,9.007451596362914E-5,8.879591227235753E-5,8.860676397835176E-5,8.852927335862772E-5,8.885197663254673E-5,8.803429869847784E-5,8.853112933337258E-5,8.996704548024736E-5,8.

{"value":"Many things become clear when watching this film: 1) the acting is terrible. Tom Hanks and Wendy Crewson are so-so, but the parent-child conflict borders soap opera-ish. The other two boys: an overly pouty child prodigy and your stereotypical I'm-a-babe-but-I'm-really-sensitive-inside blonde dreamboat; 2) the film as a whole is depressing and disappointing; 3) Robbie's dreams and episodes are disturbing (acted by Tom Hanks); 4) the inclusion of the beginning love ballads is an odd choice (\"we are all special friends\"); 5) the weird lines and side plots are not made any better by the terrible acting; and 5) this is a really bad movie. Expect to be disappointed--and probably disturbed.","finished_norm":["mani","thing","becom","clear","when","watch","thi","film","the","act","be","terribl","tom","hank","and","wendi","crewson","be","soso","but","the","parentchild","conflict","border","soap","operaish","the","other","two","boi","a","overli","pouti","child","prodigi","and","your","stereotyp","imababebutimreallysensitiveinsid","blond","dreamboat","the","film","a","a","whole","be","depress","and","disappoint","robbi","dream","and","episod","be","disturb","act","by","tom","hank","the","inclus","of","the","begin","love","ballad","be","a","odd","choic","we","be","all","special","friend","the","weird","line","and","side","plot","be","not","make","ani","well","by","the","terribl","act","and","thi","be","a","realli","bad","movi","expect","to","be","disappointedand","probabl","disturb"],"filtered":["mani","thing","becom","clear","watch","thi","film","act","terribl","tom","hank","wendi","crewson","soso","parentchild","conflict","border","soap","operaish","two","boi","overli","pouti","child","prodigi","stereotyp","imababebutimreallysensitiveinsid","blond","dreamboat","film","whole","depress","disappoint","robbi","dream","episod","disturb","act","tom","hank","inclus","begin","love","ballad","odd","choic","special","friend","weird","line","side","plot","make","ani","well","terribl","act","thi","realli","bad","movi","expect","disappointedand","probabl","disturb"],"filtered2":["mani","thing","becom","clear","watch","act","terribl","tom","hank","wendi","crewson","soso","parentchild","conflict","border","soap","operaish","two","boi","overli","pouti","child","prodigi","stereotyp","imababebutimreallysensitiveinsid","blond","dreamboat","whole","depress","disappoint","robbi","dream","disturb","act","tom","hank","inclus","begin","love","ballad","odd","choic","special","friend","weird","line","side","plot","make","ani","well","terribl","act","realli","bad","expect","disappointedand","probabl","disturb"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,9,13,20,21,27,29,32,47,50,54,107,111,115,130,147,148,161,166,180,187,203,282,425,590,604,607,625,759,768,808,839,985,1075,1331,1343,1717,2167,2188,2900,3651,4797,4956,8390,8590],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,9,13,20,21,27,29,32,47,50,54,107,111,115,130,147,148,161,166,180,187,203,282,425,590,604,607,625,759,768,808,839,985,1075,1331,1343,1717,2167,2188,2900,3651,4797,4956,8390,8590],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,3.4860466360051467,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,1.8113893252729412,2.1439533986393955,2.1183455303375887,2.201553588425805,2.2642139034199635,2.2844323215331563,2.3018654096236517,2.4323182980210873,4.884774065938707,2.7097314792693545,2.4732161909892554,2.569760528637609,2.918851229218033,3.226987993365636,3.4986697244709752,3.5727776966246974,3.68099128126493,3.6194333882654965,7.939464230129906,3.8059428063999263,3.8023521382691974,7.931007557910864,4.170873731185678,4.202455303235976,4.513582994262438,4.520909034354511,4.715065048795469,10.781025304512026,5.089758498236879,6.101359409915359,5.695894301807195,6.101359409915359,6.389041482367141,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.38393684673362E-5,7.334145234352578E-5,7.391161220081751E-5,7.348455011811441E-5,7.348575407973372E-5,7.338303568078986E-5,7.360128711081935E-5,0.04194930729878475,7.351693509871529E-5,8.156302636066275E-5,0.6655594261377096,7.323360671206738E-5,7.460047566501683E-5,7.566466784279055E-5,7.328700789411618E-5,7.30844742246634E-5,7.490747501302157E-5,7.360818299585582E-5,7.337981389485587E-5,7.344063271386596E-5,7.415121390916973E-5,7.36811100788369E-5,7.376500720055968E-5,7.384448072240048E-5,7.441119917457217E-5,7.402204955124492E-5,7.713379589315372E-5,7.325537839186659E-5,7.32573381447937E-5,7.344293519671214E-5,7.500394759114104E-5,7.360391803021084E-5,0.28679992403028126,7.381095499015056E-5,7.333511357686527E-5,7.36736034690271E-5,7.326162996043015E-5,7.330492219353524E-5,7.308410704235577E-5,7.310306843151639E-5,7.326761455412034E-5,7.404043263807451E-5,7.366420208570851E-5,7.337295442268104E-5,7.426451275515781E-5,7.340111536353311E-5,7.583986993134379E-5,7.472462253794941E-5,7.312123854041613E-5,7.32828409492611E-5,7.325742369907635E-5,7.531916297971543E-5,7.32839312582269E-5,7.309657854952497E-5,7.389891810836917E-5,7.330280725349144E-5,7.882911301423274E-5,7.324239621553353E-5,7.312039293524075E-5,7.34695213506716E-5,7.419827725577446E-5,7.346466092393269E-5,7.310686549907799E-5,7.32770836385419E-5,7.308499100756752E-5,7.477602621685562E-5,7.37145838974975E-5,7.355756104103098E-5,7.349323162943153E-5,7.37611261411331E-5,7.30823247511865E-5,7.34947723806051E-5,7.46868087

{"value":"After Highlander 2 (which I am still in denial about), I thought is was impossible to make a sequel that could make me cry because it was so bad. I was wrong. I loved the original Wargames, however, this movie is inaccurate with computer details and details about the original movie. The original Wargames at least had some hacks that worked. Whoever wrote this movie knew NOTHING ABOUT COMPUTERS except how to use a word processor. I doubt he or she even watched the original movie. The acting isn't even convincing.

{"value":"The author sets out on a \"journey of discovery\" of his \"roots\" in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the (completely and deservedly forgotten) movie \"Bright Leaf\" is about an ancestor of his. Its not, and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self-indulgent glorified home movie, suitable for screening at (the director's) drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial - or even non-commercial release. A good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios - because they are boring, irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his/her immediate circles.

{"value":"I think the show had a pretty good concept to work with. But the execution was poor. The script is poor and acting is bad. There were many issues that could have been portrayed in a better way, like the protest against gay marriage or finding the graveyard. The show can't be properly termed as comedy show as it lacks humor miserably. I should say this show was barely successful in putting the life of Muslim community to some extent.<br /><br />Till now second season is worse than the first one. I had my hopes high regarding this show, but I was kind of disappointed. Still I appreciate CBC for putting up such concept in front of the viewers. Anyway I wish best of luck for the

{"value":"The only reason I am commenting is because I finally figured out why Dr. Cox was bald. Although we probably all realized it at the same time this week, Dr. Cox is bald because they showed these episodes in a different order than they filmed them. The latest episode when our favorite grumpy, Jesus-loving Nurse Roberts dies Dr. Cox shaves his head. The must have showed them out of order for some odd reason and forgot they slipped up the continuity. For shame, Scrubs. They've made mistakes like this before. I remember when Elliot is trying to date Scott Foley and her hair is wet 2 seconds before water hits her. I try not to notice these things, but my favorite show needs to step it

{"value":"The worst kind of film. Basically, the US Declaration of Independence was replaced with a plasma screen and this fooled the museum's security for several days. Eh?<br /><br />The plasma screen that would theoretically run for less than 2 seconds off that watch battery, assuming it had a low enough internal resistance to deliver the required current, which it wouldn't.<br /><br />It would be possible with a dozen large car batteries and an inverter, but that system wouldn't fit into the case. Sorry to be anal, but this isn't even close to being plausible. The rest of the film wasn't a great deal better and I'm left wondering why the budget couldn't have been donated to charity or

{"value":"Horrible. I see many user comments on how great this show is. It truly is a Wanna-Be-Friends - Made in Taiwan knockoff. The jokes are lame as...and the plot is ridiculous. The actors are obviously struggling to be funny and are probably cringing when they hit those awful punchlines (if you can call them that). The bulk of the other users who have commented are obviously from another planet (or at least another continent). There are obviously reasons that TV companies cancel shows...and none of then are when shows are doing well. Make sense? Anyway, steer clear - even if it is raining and there is absolutely nothing else on this planet to do...go stand in the rain instead - more

{"value":"I've read some of the other comments and I do have to agree with the ones that didn't get the ending. I thought it was going rather well..until the end. It kept your mind running and then splat. I have not clue what went on the last couple minutes of the movie except a complete mess. It's like they ran out of money to come up with a good ending so they improvised. First they had a mysterious thing making people disappear then they had a guy talking about Area 51 (which makes you think about aliens) then after they it went to crap. I thought the actors and actresses did fine it's just the script went sour. Anyways, if you do watch this movie be prepared to be disappointed at the end.","finished_norm":["i","have","read","some","of","the","other","comment","and","i","do","have","to","agre","with","the","on","that","do","not","get","the","end","i","think","it","be","go","rather","welluntil","the","end","it","keep","your","mind","run","and","then","splat","i","have","not","clue","what","go","on","the","last","coupl","minut","of","the","movi","except","a","complet","mess","it","like","thei","run","out","of","monei","to","come","up","with","a","good","end","so","thei","improvis","thei","have","a","mysteri","thing","make","peopl","disappear","then","thei","have","a","gui","talk","about","area","which","make","you","think","about","alien","then","after","thei","it","go","to","crap","i","think","the","actor","and","actress","do","fine","it","just","the","script","go","sour","anywai","if","you","do","watch","thi","movi","be","prepar","to","be","disappoint","at","the","end"],"filtered":["read","comment","agre","get","end","think","go","rather","welluntil","end","keep","mind","run","splat","clue","go","last","coupl","minut","movi","except","complet","mess","like","thei","run","monei","come","good","end","thei","improvis","thei","mysteri","thing","make","peopl","disappear","thei","gui","talk","area","make","think","alien","thei","go","crap","think","actor","actress","fine","script","go","sour","anywai","watch","thi","movi","prepar","disappoint","end"],"filtered2":["read","comment","agre","get","end","think","go","rather","welluntil","end","keep","mind","run","splat","clue","go","last","coupl","minut","except","complet","mess","like","run","monei","come","good","end","improvis","mysteri","thing","make","peopl","disappear","gui","talk","area","make","think","alien","go","crap","think","actor","actress","fine","script","go","sour","anywai","watch","prepar","disappoint","end"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,7,12,23,24,29,34,41,55,59,77,103,126,134,137,144,145,160,186,187,233,238,253,280,313,354,386,403,407,464,565,622,1038,1156,1203,1295,3879,5326],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,7,12,23,24,29,34,41,55,59,77,103,126,134,137,144,145,160,186,187,233,238,253,280,313,354,386,403,407,464,565,622,1038,1156,1203,1295,3879,5326],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,3.8833076578815384,0.9609497720722932,3.200185830788664,1.364847727375781,5.284144626447703,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.5687599167621034,1.9536997889255368,1.8693254449200722,1.9463902258768238,2.098582041218749,2.2391270689902285,2.2443961816702407,4.587807168251287,2.2931108769894046,2.34599021453259,2.3722295531801256,2.571852579609833,2.4732161909892554,2.6102777977348763,2.597304642813496,2.7073305177318163,2.8028805344481915,2.907069060519773,3.0316467233633775,3.0433232530252132,3.189397019426827,3.120015873813468,3.2872346624216657,3.9081109809587793,3.4933926673701317,4.165705761027235,4.2860694432771105,4.3521595551061,4.358390104856736,5.7959777603641776,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0452829582026765E-4,1.0382343708483089E-4,1.0463056530741575E-4,1.0402600878640275E-4,1.0402771313543651E-4,1.038823031811824E-4,1.041912637061009E-4,1.0383838698136845E-4,1.0407185352888428E-4,1.1546204043165771E-4,0.9087238530228271,1.03670768930945E-4,1.0560573242301012E-4,1.0711222140140859E-4,1.0374636457416638E-4,1.034596543848249E-4,1.0604032604604556E-4,1.0420102564104151E-4,1.0387774236491097E-4,1.0396383854418338E-4,1.0496974965811563E-4,1.0430426248964117E-4,1.0442302871611271E-4,1.0453553281756E-4,1.053377893271293E-4,1.0478690234380563E-4,1.091919446524836E-4,1.0370158929999464E-4,1.0370436356036485E-4,1.0396709797899521E-4,1.0617689430757771E-4,1.0419498808140558E-4,1.1184449316862585E-4,1.0448807320717938E-4,1.0381446381636476E-4,1.0429363600207642E-4,1.0371043912931626E-4,1.0377172436837856E-4,1.0345913459515621E-4,1.0348597666784027E-4,1.0371891102435812E-4,1.0481292576163947E-4,1.042803272401376E-4,1.0386803197665136E-4,1.0513013747745048E-4,1.0390789709490823E-4,1.0736024052888425E-4,1.0578147689819205E-4,1.035116985904079E-4,1.0374046577446752E-4,1.0370448467249717E-4,1.0662311870071537E-4,1.0374200923482585E-4,1.0347678947788024E-4,1.0461259532909454E-4,1.0376873042242358E-4,1.1159186509085657E-4,1.036832115051096E-4,1.0351050153699648E-4,1.04004733801504E-4,1.0503637335111711E-4,1.0399785329677432E-4,1.0349135186280154E-4,1.0373231562515725E-4,1.034603859517031E-4,1.0585424484118084E-4,1.0435164861024073E-4,1.0412936432027504E-4,1.0403829848500067E-4,1.0441753462080478E-4,1.0345661155274068E-4,1.0404047959919216E-4,1.0572794711158007E-4,1.0364201154723513E-4,0.08310990759689019,1.0391603049627675E-4,1.0472932945767992E-4,1.0408926986804057E-4,1.0342417485798191E-4,1.0355237622595089E-4]}}

{"value":"The movie that shoots scenes of a scenic caverns tour.<br /><br />Remember no one from this movie except for Michael Pataki who dished out extreme pain as JC in \"Five the Hard Way\". He's the really annoying sheriff who I did applaud when he practices nightstick on our rabid doctor. Probably the most laughs you will have is with Dr. Beck's epileptic seizures out of nowhere. Could Mrs. Beck be anymore wooden? Seriously, if you took a 4 foot branch, stuck it in a hot tub, you wouldn't be able to notice a difference. The dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will roll.<br /><br />Watch it as a late night movie, MSTified, but don't go out of your way.","finished_norm":["the","movi","that","shoot","scene","of","a","scenic","cavern","tourbr","br","rememb","no","on","from","thi","movi","except","for","michael","pataki","who","dish","out","extrem","pain","a","jc","in","five","the","hard","wai","he","the","realli","annoi","sheriff","who","i","do","applaud","when","he","practic","nightstick","on","our","rabid","doctor","probabl","the","much","laugh","you","will","have","be","with","dr","beck","epilept","seizur","out","of","nowher","can","mr","beck","be","anymor","wooden","serious","if","you","take","a","foot","branch","stick","it","in","a","hot","tub","you","would","not","be","abl","to","notic","a","differ","the","dread","and","suspens","be","look","over","at","the","clock","wonder","when","the","credit","will","rollbr","br","watch","it","a","a","late","night","movi","mstifi","but","do","not","go","out","of","your","wai"],"filtered":["movi","shoot","scene","scenic","cavern","tourbr","br","rememb","thi","movi","except","michael","pataki","dish","extrem","pain","jc","five","hard","wai","realli","annoi","sheriff","applaud","practic","nightstick","rabid","doctor","probabl","much","laugh","dr","beck","epilept","seizur","nowher","mr","beck","anymor","wooden","serious","take","foot","branch","stick","hot","tub","abl","notic","differ","dread","suspens","look","clock","wonder","credit","rollbr","br","watch","late","night","movi","mstifi","go","wai"],"filtered2":["shoot","scene","scenic","cavern","tourbr","rememb","except","michael","pataki","dish","extrem","pain","jc","five","hard","wai","realli","annoi","sheriff","applaud","practic","nightstick","rabid","doctor","probabl","laugh","dr","beck","epilept","seizur","nowher","mr","beck","anymor","wooden","serious","take","foot","branch","stick","hot","tub","abl","notic","differ","dread","suspens","look","clock","wonder","credit","rollbr","watch","late","night","mstifi","go","wai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,7,13,16,19,31,33,117,133,148,150,171,175,204,210,233,271,290,329,356,357,371,416,454,459,466,505,529,666,688,693,739,799,890,917,981,995,1352,1644,2777,3391,4061,5413,6737,7407,7710,8174,8609],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,7,13,16,19,31,33,117,133,148,150,171,175,204,210,233,271,290,329,356,357,371,416,454,459,466,505,529,666,688,693,739,799,890,917,981,995,1352,1644,2777,3391,4061,5413,6737,7407,7710,8174,8609],"values":[0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.4070669811451506,2.803707089537043,2.2797301185117202,2.3212364753796515,2.3018654096236517,2.332712011146513,2.373087554090762,2.3791142619576227,2.624524614047584,2.687151791517189,2.6102777977348763,2.757740698455715,2.8612813773965557,2.951986790814132,3.028335462059722,3.2829611516442836,3.0466846007279185,3.1401446412440817,3.2556198060399626,3.2829611516442836,3.4446025032006995,3.3956930001684253,3.4648563601051974,3.6621227969605474,3.6016814428070463,3.8463152616903136,4.004218291136122,3.7636829971100436,3.8767358583910254,3.9363956947973615,4.039936373738201,4.030886538218284,4.436351646326448,4.890269137820559,5.390512652256013,5.626901430320244,5.878215858601149,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399,6.794506590475304,14.071337294584385,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.887419512048298E-5,6.840976032131317E-5,6.894158097574289E-5,6.854323578640579E-5,6.854435879015308E-5,6.844854747434459E-5,6.865212304506233E-5,6.841961087979667E-5,6.857344310696088E-5,7.607849185040625E-5,0.10960169648008394,6.830916654297872E-5,6.958412326218761E-5,7.057675607066161E-5,6.83589768746275E-5,6.817006215666739E-5,6.987047908341451E-5,6.865855523078369E-5,6.844554233064334E-5,6.850227151582523E-5,6.916507117013088E-5,6.87265784851406E-5,6.880483412100966E-5,6.887896361268586E-5,6.940757427205949E-5,6.904459219834417E-5,7.194709568891618E-5,6.832947423186769E-5,6.833130220532265E-5,6.850441917304524E-5,6.996046456551022E-5,6.865457705380152E-5,7.369487261987716E-5,6.884769224793198E-5,6.840384779171192E-5,6.87195766415514E-5,6.833530542682496E-5,6.837568656458349E-5,6.816971966476335E-5,6.818740603510902E-5,6.834088759907386E-5,6.906173915308522E-5,6.871080743452096E-5,6.843914410927715E-5,6.927075147303002E-5,6.846541142677026E-5,7.074017706251191E-5,0.8850172488080889,6.82043543331741E-5,6.835509012723294E-5,6.833138200668713E-5,7.025448395690379E-5,6.835610712066085E-5,6.818135255161013E-5,6.892974047089687E-5,6.837371383924376E-5,7.352841476858766E-5,6.831736501473308E-5,6.820356558894383E-5,6.852921759688492E-5,6.920896984077718E-5,6.852468399934024E-5,6.819094777683233E-5,6.83497199547887E-5,6.817054418958983E-5,6.974786928564124E-5,6.87578014271255E-5,6.86113372430577E-5,6.855133352771651E-5,6.880121403527805E-5,6.8168057
