{"value":"Do not see this movie if you value your mind. At the end of our collective viewing, me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5% of our brains during its course. The only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer.<br /><br />Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. I realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion, this movie has bred a deep hatred within me. I hate this movie so very, very much.<br /><br />Some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. If only it didn't take itself seriously. But it does. The plot is a warmed over version of Blade Runner-esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies. The dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful. Whoopee Goldberg isn't even trying, but George Newbern as the voice of Theodore Rex is like fingernails on the soul. And whether its Juliet Landua with her off again on again British accent or Richard Roundtree (aka Shaft) as the blustering Commissioner, you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment.<br /><br />I recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall.","finished_norm":["do","not","see","thi","movi","if","you","valu","your","mind","at","the","end","of","our","collect","view","me","and","my","friend","estim","that","we","each","lose","of","our","brain","dure","it","cours","the","onli","person","involv","with","it","make","that","be","not","clinic","insan","be","the","set","designerbr","br","much","movi","leav","a","bad","tast","in","your","mouth","i","realiz","now","that","instead","of","a","feel","of","revuls","thi","movi","have","bre","a","deep","hatr","within","me","i","hate","thi","movi","so","veri","veri","muchbr","br","some","mai","sai","thi","movi","be","not","mean","to","be","take","serious","if","onli","it","do","not","take","itself","serious","but","it","doe","the","plot","be","a","warm","over","version","of","blade","runneresqu","univers","meld","with","the","cheap","rubber","suit","so","preval","in","bad","dinosaur","movi","the","dialogu","be","not","onli","pueril","and","meaningless","but","often","liter","pain","whoope","goldberg","be","not","even","try","but","georg","newbern","a","the","voic","of","theodor","rex","be","like","fingernail","on","the","soul","and","whether","it","juliet","landua","with","her","off","again","on","again","british","accent","or","richard","roundtre","aka","shaft","a","the","bluster","commission","you","will","sink","into","a","ever","increas","sens","of","incredul","and","disillusionmentbr","br","i","recommend","thi","movi","onli","to","anyon","who","wish","to","see","the","depth","of","stupid","to","which","mankind","mai","fall"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","valu","mind","end","collect","view","friend","estim","lose","brain","dure","cours","onli","person","involv","make","clinic","insan","set","designerbr","br","much","movi","leav","bad","tast","mouth","realiz","instead","feel","revuls","thi","movi","bre","deep","hatr","within","hate","thi","movi","veri","veri","muchbr","br","mai","sai","thi","movi","mean","take","serious","onli","take","serious","doe","plot","warm","version","blade","runneresqu","univers","meld","cheap","rubber","suit","preval","bad","dinosaur","movi","dialogu","onli","pueril","meaningless","often","liter","pain","whoope","goldberg","even","try","georg","newbern","voic","theodor","rex","like","fingernail","soul","whether","juliet","landua","british","accent","richard","roundtre","aka","shaft","bluster","commission","sink","ever","increas","sens","incredul","disillusionmentbr","br","recommend","thi","movi","onli","anyon","wish","see","depth","stupid","mankind","mai","fall"],"filtered2":["see","valu","mind","end","collect","view","friend","estim","lose","brain","dure","cours","onli","person","involv","make","clinic","insan","set","designerbr","leav","bad","tast","mouth","realiz","instead","feel","revuls","bre","deep","hatr","within","hate","veri","veri","muchbr","mai","mean","take","serious","onli","take","serious","doe","plot","warm","version","blade","runneresqu","univers","meld","cheap","rubber","suit","preval","bad","dinosaur","dialogu","onli","pueril","meaningless","often","liter","pain","whoope","goldberg","even","try","georg","newbern","voic","theodor","rex","like","fingernail","soul","whether","juliet","landua","british","accent","richard","roundtre","aka","shaft","bluster","commission","sink","ever","increas","sens","incredul","disillusionmentbr","recommend","onli","anyon","wish","see","depth","stupid","mankind","mai","fall"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,9,11,15,18,24,31,32,36,43,44,46,74,88,109,136,152,153,158,161,169,173,199,220,221,238,239,241,248,298,312,339,351,371,399,400,405,428,451,458,559,597,641,672,673,680,696,834,872,884,897,913,914,941,1006,1026,1285,1359,1362,1714,1922,2249,2626,2997,3095,3100,3153,3287,3372,3460,3518,3571,5290,5495,5850,7091,7114,7492,7698,8335,8533],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,9,11,15,18,24,31,32,36,43,44,46,74,88,109,136,152,153,158,161,169,173,199,220,221,238,239,241,248,298,312,339,351,371,399,400,405,428,451,458,559,597,641,672,673,680,696,834,872,884,897,913,914,941,1006,1026,1285,1359,1362,1714,1922,2249,2626,2997,3095,3100,3153,3287,3372,3460,3518,3571,5290,5495,5850,7091,7114,7492,7698,8335,8533],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,2.1367141713444147,3.965239261355278,2.4001215597131385,1.2153159934048174,1.3210361566119257,2.814133962290301,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,3.311542587503466,1.9486336368009016,2.0317223413467334,2.125691139326857,2.346825985579986,2.3131195476980753,2.3409902041158843,2.3106972614914807,2.4323182980210873,2.4071371113909277,2

{"value":"As a Hammer completist I was dreading the time when I would have to raise the courage to watch this film and the one following it, Holiday on the Buses. I had seen One the Buses the film and thought it one of the worst films I have ever seen. It was full of all the awful comedy that plagued British TV screens around the early 70's.<br /><br />I am ashamed to say that there were actually parts of this film that I laughed at. I don't know if it was because I was now familiar with the characters and enjoyed some of the situations, knowing how they would react. I found Blakey particularly funny, although I could swear at no point in the trilogy does he say his catchphrase, \"I'll get you Butler\".<br /><br />Having watched Holiday on the Buses the jokes were starting to wear thin and these three films could be compared to an early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, in that the second film made is the best (although this is probably the only way they could be compared).<br /><br />The only people who would want to watch this film are probably fans of the TV series, who will no doubt enjoy this, and Hammer completists like myself. To the completists I would say that this film isn't that bad and I can certainly think of worse Hammer comedies.","finished_norm":["a","a","hammer","completist","i","be","dread","the","time","when","i","would","have","to","rais","the","courag","to","watch","thi","film","and","the","on","follow","it","holidai","on","the","bu","i","have","see","on","the","bu","the","film","and","think","it","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","it","be","full","of","all","the","aw","comedi","that","plagu","british","tv","screen","around","the","earli","sbr","br","i","be","asham","to","sai","that","there","be","actual","part","of","thi","film","that","i","laugh","at","i","do","not","know","if","it","be","becaus","i","be","now","familiar","with","the","charact","and","enjoi","some","of","the","situat","know","how","thei","would","react","i","find","blakei","particularli","funni","although","i","can","swear","at","no","point","in","the","trilogi","doe","he","sai","hi","catchphras","i","will","get","you","butlerbr","br","have","watch","holidai","on","the","bu","the","joke","be","start","to","wear","thin","and","thi","three","film","can","be","compar","to","a","earli","hammer","trilogi","dick","barton","in","that","the","film","make","be","the","well","although","thi","be","probabl","the","onli","wai","thei","can","be","comparedbr","br","the","onli","peopl","who","would","want","to","watch","thi","film","be","probabl","fan","of","the","tv","seri","who","will","no","doubt","enjoi","thi","and","hammer","completist","like","myself","to","the","completist","i","would","sai","that","thi","film","be","not","that","bad","and","i","can","certainli","think","of","wrong","hammer","comedi"],"filtered":["hammer","completist","dread","time","rais","courag","watch","thi","film","follow","holidai","bu","see","bu","film","think","wrong","film","ever","see","full","aw","comedi","plagu","british","tv","screen","around","earli","sbr","br","asham","sai","actual","part","thi","film","laugh","know","becaus","familiar","charact","enjoi","situat","know","thei","react","find","blakei","particularli","funni","although","swear","point","trilogi","doe","sai","hi","catchphras","get","butlerbr","br","watch","holidai","bu","joke","start","wear","thin","thi","three","film","compar","earli","hammer","trilogi","dick","barton","film","make","well","although","thi","probabl","onli","wai","thei","comparedbr","br","onli","peopl","want","watch","thi","film","probabl","fan","tv","seri","doubt","enjoi","thi","hammer","completist","like","completist","sai","thi","film","bad","certainli","think","wrong","hammer","comedi"],"filtered2":["hammer","completist","dread","time","rais","courag","watch","follow","holidai","bu","see","bu","think","wrong","ever","see","full","aw","comedi","plagu","british","tv","screen","around","earli","sbr","asham","actual","part","laugh","know","becaus","familiar","charact","enjoi","situat","know","react","find","blakei","particularli","funni","although","swear","point","trilogi","doe","catchphras","get","butlerbr","watch","holidai","bu","joke","start","wear","thin","three","compar","earli","hammer","trilogi","dick","barton","make","well","although","probabl","onli","wai","comparedbr","onli","peopl","want","watch","probabl","fan","tv","doubt","enjoi","hammer","completist","like","completist","bad","certainli","think","wrong","hammer","comedi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,8,9,10,11,12,18,20,22,23,25,26,33,37,38,44,52,61,62,66,71,98,127,133,138,140,148,172,192,200,214,224,237,260,266,336,389,473,482,497,514,567,696,980,995,1044,1095,1584,1597,1863,1923,2031,2048,2290,2476,2575,3183,3994,4592,4903,8197],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,8,9,10,11,12,18,20,22,23,25,26,33,37,38,44,52,61,62,66,71,98,127,133,138,140,148,172,192,200,214,224,237,260,266,336,389,473,482,497,514,567,696,980,995,1044,1095,1584,1597,1863,1923,2031,2048,2290,2476,2575,3183,3994,4592,4903,8197],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.982619630677639,2.133457220525776,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,2.559277576165403,2.6649848339420377,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.604729392502474,1.7122153074726136,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,1.929723173391612,1.9214926742550966,2.0881990796736947,4.871935874217273,2.3212364753796515,2.2907365189289424,2.317169775997098,4.603730819247303,5.000281788719697,2.5318267134339894,5.061642365863941,2.7303758068497004,2.689504733779216,5.280195575021108,2.6754694156628323,5.495405946044408,2.9233055795674137,3.0914425013694116,3.335489637924323,3.3154667220492153,3.342254038012865,3.405285399859865,3.454678155189441,3.809

{"value":"I really, really didn't expect this type of a film outside of America. How anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a \"thriller\" is just sick. Auteuil (whom I had previously admired) going around like some sort of child-saving Rambo was ignorant and insulting to all the children being sexually exploited around the world.<br /><br />What's doubly depressing is that the stunning and ground-breaking film \"Happiness\" came out the year BEFORE this film. Menges and his cohorts should be ashamed of themselves. It's admirable to read some of the comments by the more intelligent viewers out there. They were able to see the shoddy and ridiculous handling of this topic. Those of you who think this is great cinema display a disgusting amount of ignorance and you need to watch \"Happiness\" to open your minds to the true horrors of pedophilia.<br /><br />Do you think your child is more likely to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery or be molested by a neighbor, teacher, friend or even a relative? Hmm...I wonder. If they are going to make a film about international child slavery of whatever kind they owe it to everyone to make it realistic and emotionally involving instead of this button-pushing crap.

A) Many of the reviews where written before the film was released and, B) The breakdown of user ratings has a lot less variation than normal 77% of people rating the movie 10/10, with only 7% of people giving it 9/10 - Why such an enormous

{"value":"OK, first of all, Steve Irwin, rest in peace. You were loved by many fans. Now...this movie wasn't a movie at all. It was \"The Crocodile Hunter\" TV program with bad acting, bad scripts, and bad directing in between Steve capturing or teaching us about animals. He was entertaining as an animal seeker/specialist. Millions will miss him. But the whole movie idea was a big mistake. The plot was so broken, it was almost non-existent. Casting was horrible. The acting wasn't even worth elementary school-level actors. The direction must be faulted as well. If you can't get a half-way decent performance out of your actors, no matter how bad the script is, you must not be that good in the first place. I could have written a better script. I wish I had never been to see this movie. Of course, I watched it for $3 ($1.50 for me, $1.50 for my son.) while out with friends who insisted upon seeing this instead of Scooby Doo Live Action. My son, who is not so discriminating, liked the movie alright, but he still has never asked to see it again. If you want fond memories of Steve Irwin, buy his series on DVD. Avoid this movie like the plague. If I were Steve, I know I wouldn't want to be remembered for this movie.

{"value":"I was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week. My 13 year old son was looking forward to it too. I rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen.<br /><br />Boy, was I disappointed. This movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable. George C. Scott is an excellent actor but in this, it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20% of the time. The rest of the time he was quite flat.<br /><br />I realize that this was made in '84, pre-CG effects, for the most part. But it looked to be very B-movie quality, especially the encounter with Jacob Marley.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story: When the Spirit of Christmas Present takes Scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world, observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of Christmastime.<br /><br />I will admit that Mr. Scott did a good job with the \"reformed\" Scrooge at the end. That was a refreshing portrayal.<br /><br />I wish that Bob Cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down-trodden.

{"value":"I had to watch this film because the plot was so outrageous and the film lived up to expectations. In fact it makes for quite uncomfortable viewing at times. Unlike other Meyer films, the sexual antics are down to a minimum. Some of the scenes of violence are unnecessarily gratuitous and offensive. The plot is chaotic and some of the acting and lines are dreadful.<br /><br />The film is a strange combination of sado-masochistic fantasy combined with a window of the brutality and immorality of the slavery and fails on all counts. It's as though Meyer was trying to make up for the sexploitation/ blackploitation by having a higher moral message. Meyer knows we feel a bit guilty about getting turned on by the blatant dominatrix connotations of the early scene showing Lady Susan wielding a whip in a provocative outfit. He then tries to steer back to the righteous path by turning it into a film about the triumph of good over evil. However, because they cancel each other out, you end up with nothing.<br /><br />Because it so bad in so many ways, it is actually worth watching if you appreciate the art of making an awful film in the worst possible taste. Perhaps, because it is so bad, we almost let Meyer get away with the

{"value":"Well how was I suppose to know this was \"the\" dumb ass promotional \"Lordi Motion Picture\"? I mean, I realized this when that \"dinosaur\" costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance I was humming \"Hard Rock Hallelujah\" to myself... even though I hate that song. \"Dark Floors\" is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they, and the rest of the people in that particular elevator, become momentarily trapped... When they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around. The hospital is empty... Except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason... They run through the hallways and stairwells, encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish, shock-rock costumes... Nothing really memorable here, except the lousy acting, lack of gore/nudity, and the utterly shameless promotional edge, reminding me very much of \"KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park\".

{"value":"The only reason I even watched this was because I found it at my local library (and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it), and despite the plethora of tits and ass, it didn't take long to realize that the fast-forward button was my friend. Terrible direction, pedestrian camera work, sporadically bad-to-nearly-passable acting, chintzy effects, and one of the worst screenplays I've had the displeasure of seeing brought to life (such as it was, horribly crippled and mutilated) in a long, long time. Best laughs actually come from the \"Making of...\" featurette, in which the poor saps involved with this HDV mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special, instead of something that won't be utterly forgotten next week. Wait! Except for the fact that somehow someone lured Tippi \"The Birds\" Hedren, of all people, into doing a bit part, along with Kane \"Friday the 13th\" Hodder! How this came to pass, I'll never know, and to be honest, I don't really care. Watch at your own risk, and don't say you haven't been warned. This is film-making at its pretentious, craven worst. It only gets a 2 from me for having some good-looking naked women, and even then, just barely.","finished_norm":["the","onli","reason","i","even","watch","thi","be","becaus","i","find","it","at","my","local","librari","and","will","berat","them","mercilessli","for","have","wast","public","monei","on","it","and","despit","the","plethora","of","tit","and","ass","it","do","not","take","long","to","realiz","that","the","fastforward","button","be","my","friend","terribl","direct","pedestrian","camera","work","sporad","badtonearlypass","act","chintzi","effect","and","on","of","the","wrong","screenplai","i","have","have","the","displeasur","of","see","bring","to","life","such","a","it","be","horribli","crippl","and","mutil","in","a","long","long","time","well","laugh","actual","come","from","the","make","of","featurett","in","which","the","poor","sap","involv","with","thi","hdv","mess","attempt","to","justifi","their","lame","effort","a","if","thei","have","be","work","on","someth","special","instead","of","someth","that","wo","not","be","utterli","forget","next","week","wait","except","for","the","fact","that","somehow","someon","lure","tippi","the","bird","hedren","of","all","peopl","into","do","a","bite","part","along","with","kane","fridai","the","th","hodder","how","thi","come","to","pass","i","will","never","know","and","to","be","honest","i","do","not","realli","care","watch","at","your","own","risk","and","do","not","sai","you","have","not","be","warn","thi","be","filmmak","at","it","pretenti","craven","wrong","it","onli","get","a","from","me","for","have","some","goodlook","nake","woman","and","even","then","just","bare"],"filtered":["onli","reason","even","watch","thi","becaus","find","local","librari","berat","mercilessli","wast","public","monei","despit","plethora","tit","ass","take","long","realiz","fastforward","button","friend","terribl","direct","pedestrian","camera","work","sporad","badtonearlypass","act","chintzi","effect","wrong","screenplai","displeasur","see","bring","life","horribli","crippl","mutil","long","long","time","well","laugh","actual","come","make","featurett","poor","sap","involv","thi","hdv","mess","attempt","justifi","lame","effort","thei","work","someth","special","instead","someth","wo","utterli","forget","next","week","wait","except","fact","somehow","someon","lure","tippi","bird","hedren","peopl","bite","part","along","kane","fridai","th","hodder","thi","come","pass","never","know","honest","realli","care","watch","risk","sai","warn","thi","filmmak","pretenti","craven","wrong","onli","get","goodlook","nake","woman","even","bare"],"filtered2":["onli","reason","even","watch","becaus","find","local","librari","berat","mercilessli","wast","public","monei","despit","plethora","tit","ass","take","long","realiz","fastforward","button","friend","terribl","direct","pedestrian","camera","work","sporad","badtonearlypass","act","chintzi","effect","wrong","screenplai","displeasur","see","bring","life","horribli","crippl","mutil","long","long","time","well","laugh","actual","come","make","featurett","poor","sap","involv","hdv","mess","attempt","justifi","lame","effort","work","someth","special","instead","someth","wo","utterli","forget","next","week","wait","except","fact","somehow","someon","lure","tippi","bird","hedren","peopl","bite","part","along","kane","fridai","th","hodder","come","pass","never","know","honest","realli","care","watch","risk","warn","filmmak","pretenti","craven","wrong","onli","get","goodlook","nake","woman","even","bare"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,7,8,11,13,20,21,22,23,25,26,31,34,38,42,48,52,53,61,70,75,89,95,97,99,102,106,126,133,139,146,152,154,161,166,177,203,205,231,232,241,250,297,323,324,331,372,373,391,401,405,406,407,475,487,527,549,594,703,780,816,853,857,893,1047,1102,1276,1660,1676,1724,1927,2299,2549,2833,2902,2919,2984,3252,3747,3980,4015,4307,4563,5025,6366,6460,7190,7369,7748,7858],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,7,8,11,13,20,21,22,23,25,26,31,34,38,42,48,52,53,61,70,75,89,95,97,99,102,106,126,133,139,146,152,154,161,166,177,203,205,231,232,241,250,297,323,324,331,372,373,391,401,405,406,407,475,487,527,549,594,703,780,816,853,857,893,1047,1102,1276,1660,1676,1724,1927,2299,2549,2833,2902,2919,2984,3252,3747,3980,4015,4307,4563,5025,6366,6460,7190,7369,7748,7858],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.982619630677639,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,2.559277576165403,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,2.7965700178917925,1.519311641348122,1.6219954307453837,3.3910232

{"value":"The original Boogeyman was a silly but entertaining supernatural slasher flick. It was by no means a great film but fun in the right frame of mind. The third instalment in this series, Return of the Boogeyman, on the other hand, is simply atrocious. It consists of two things. Firstly, cheap and lifeless new footage. Secondly, LOADS of recycled bits from the first movie. The new material is unbelievably amateurish but not in an amusingly inept way, simply incredibly tedious. This footage has clearly been knocked together quickly and without any effort. It serves as a framing device for the endless clips from the first (and possibly second) movies. And boy, do they milk those clips from the earlier films; sometimes reusing sequences over and over again. The only new addition to these parts is a voice over that pointlessly describes exactly what we can see with our own eyes. The whole experience of watching this is truly mind-numbing.<br /><br />Return of the Boogeyman is an example of the very worst kind of exploitation flick; the kind that exploits the audience in a highly cynical way. I want to keep this review brief and to the point because this film deserves no more. There is nothing here of value at all.

worthless.","finished_norm":["the","origin","boogeyman","be","a","silli","but","entertain","supernatur","slasher","flick","it","be","by","no","mean","a","great","film","but","fun","in","the","right","frame","of","mind","the","instal","in","thi","seri","return","of","the","boogeyman","on","the","other","hand","be","simpli","atroci","it","consist","of","two","thing","firstli","cheap","and","lifeless","new","footag","secondli","load","of","recycl","bit","from","the","movi","the","new","materi","be","unbeliev","amateurish","but","not","in","a","amusingli","inept","wai","simpli","incredibli","tediou","thi","footag","have","clearli","be","knock","togeth","quickli","and","without","ani","effort","it","serv","a","a","frame","devic","for","the","endless","clip","from","the","and","possibli","movi","and","boi","do","thei","milk","that","clip","from","the","earli","film","sometim","reus","sequenc","over","and","over","again","the","onli","new","addit","to","thi","part","be","a","voic","over","that","pointlessli","describ","exactli","what","we","can","see","with","our","own","ey","the","whole","experi","of","watch","thi","be","truli","mindnumbingbr","br","return","of","the","boogeyman","be","a","exampl","of","the","veri","wrong","kind","of","exploit","flick","the","kind","that","exploit","the","audienc","in","a","highli","cynic","wai","i","want","to","keep","thi","review","brief","and","to","the","point","becaus","thi","film","deserv","no","much","there","be","noth","here","of","valu","at","all","thi","be","worthless"],"filtered":["origin","boogeyman","silli","entertain","supernatur","slasher","flick","mean","great","film","fun","right","frame","mind","instal","thi","seri","return","boogeyman","hand","simpli","atroci","consist","two","thing","firstli","cheap","lifeless","new","footag","secondli","load","recycl","bit","movi","new","materi","unbeliev","amateurish","amusingli","inept","wai","simpli","incredibli","tediou","thi","footag","clearli","knock","togeth","quickli","without","ani","effort","serv","frame","devic","endless","clip","possibli","movi","boi","thei","milk","clip","earli","film","sometim","reus","sequenc","onli","new","addit","thi","part","voic","pointlessli","describ","exactli","see","ey","whole","experi","watch","thi","truli","mindnumbingbr","br","return","boogeyman","exampl","veri","wrong","kind","exploit","flick","kind","exploit","audienc","highli","cynic","wai","want","keep","thi","review","brief","point","becaus","thi","film","deserv","much","noth","valu","thi","worthless"],"filtered2":["origin","boogeyman","silli","entertain","supernatur","slasher","flick","mean","great","fun","right","frame","mind","instal","return","boogeyman","hand","simpli","atroci","consist","two","thing","firstli","cheap","lifeless","new","footag","secondli","load","recycl","bit","new","materi","unbeliev","amateurish","amusingli","inept","wai","simpli","incredibli","tediou","footag","clearli","knock","togeth","quickli","without","ani","effort","serv","frame","devic","endless","clip","possibli","boi","milk","clip","earli","sometim","reus","sequenc","onli","new","addit","part","voic","pointlessli","describ","exactli","see","ey","whole","experi","watch","truli","mindnumbingbr","return","boogeyman","exampl","veri","wrong","kind","exploit","flick","kind","exploit","audienc","highli","cynic","wai","want","keep","review","brief","point","becaus","deserv","noth","valu","worthless"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,11,15,22,25,27,29,33,37,47,49,51,61,66,69,87,88,111,121,122,125,134,168,176,195,201,235,238,257,259,266,270,281,282,307,333,342,349,351,385,401,423,428,451,462,488,494,500,537,558,571,658,668,687,731,770,815,828,896,918,1185,1186,1188,1219,1240,1296,1320,1382,1401,1410,1413,1555,1563,1890,1915,2149,2163,2478,2577,2981,3006,3017,5090,5841,6109,7404],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,11,15,22,25,27,29,33,37,47,49,51,61,66,69,87,88,111,121,122,125,134,168,176,195,201,235,238,257,259,266,270,281,282,307,333,342,349,351,385,401,423,428,451,462,488,494,500,537,558,571,658,668,687,731,770,815,828,896,918,1185,1186,1188,1219,1240,1296,1320,1382,1401,1410,1413,1555,1563,1890,1915,2149,2163,2478,2577,2981,3006,3017,5090,5841,6109,7404],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,2.803707089537043,1.4876543214774305,1.7064694353107215,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,1.8818517047392527,1.929723173391612,2.127032521151058,6.345073114567986,2.0317223413467334,2.1183455303375887,2.2190595059394194,4.497869534746497,2.2242236634876535

{"value":"I loathed this film. The original Phantasm had such wonderful ambiance and mystery. Like many 70s horror flicks, it looked and felt like some creepy, unfinished documentary. Phantasm II, from the late 80s, pumped up the action, but maintained this nice attention to mood. Sadly, Phantasm III is just awful. It tediously explains all of the weird happenings in the previous films, which diminishes rather than expands their power. It shamelessly degrades imagery from the first Phantasm like a cheap reenactment of the original. There are so many flying spheres in this movie that they seem more like household pests than menacing death orbs. Hundreds hang from the ceiling like Christmas balls swaying in the draft. Didn't anyone-- the prop master, the DP, the editor, the director-- notice or care that they looked so crummy? Even worse, Phantasm III presents one corny, unfunny joke after another. How different from the intensity of the first film. The original Phantasm used humor to relieve its relentless focus on death. Phantasm III uses death to set up countless cheap jokes about Reggie's horniness: several refer to the film's \"flying balls\" ha-ha, oh, I get it, balls. Maybe the crew got a kick out of these jokes, but they are on us.","finished_norm":["i","loath","thi","film","the","origin","phantasm","have","such","wonder","ambianc","and","mysteri","like","mani","horror","flick","it","look","and","feel","like","some","creepi","unfinish","documentari","phantasm","ii","from","the","late","pump","up","the","action","but","maintain","thi","nice","attent","to","mood","sadli","phantasm","iii","be","just","aw","it","tedious","explain","all","of","the","weird","happen","in","the","previou","film","which","diminish","rather","than","expand","their","power","it","shamelessli","degrad","imageri","from","the","phantasm","like","a","cheap","reenact","of","the","origin","there","be","so","mani","fly","sphere","in","thi","movi","that","thei","seem","much","like","household","pest","than","menac","death","orb","hundr","hang","from","the","ceil","like","christma","ball","swai","in","the","draft","do","not","anyon","the","prop","master","the","dp","the","editor","the","director","notic","or","care","that","thei","look","so","crummi","even","wrong","phantasm","iii","present","on","corni","unfunni","joke","after","anoth","how","differ","from","the","intens","of","the","film","the","origin","phantasm","us","humor","to","reliev","it","relentless","focu","on","death","phantasm","iii","us","death","to","set","up","countless","cheap","joke","about","reggi","horni","sever","refer","to","the","film","fly","ball","haha","oh","i","get","it","ball","mayb","the","crow","get","a","kick","out","of","thi","joke","but","thei","be","on","u"],"filtered":["loath","thi","film","origin","phantasm","wonder","ambianc","mysteri","like","mani","horror","flick","look","feel","like","creepi","unfinish","documentari","phantasm","ii","late","pump","action","maintain","thi","nice","attent","mood","sadli","phantasm","iii","aw","tedious","explain","weird","happen","previou","film","diminish","rather","expand","power","shamelessli","degrad","imageri","phantasm","like","cheap","reenact","origin","mani","fly","sphere","thi","movi","thei","seem","much","like","household","pest","menac","death","orb","hundr","hang","ceil","like","christma","ball","swai","draft","anyon","prop","master","dp","editor","director","notic","care","thei","look","crummi","even","wrong","phantasm","iii","present","corni","unfunni","joke","anoth","differ","intens","film","origin","phantasm","us","humor","reliev","relentless","focu","death","phantasm","iii","us","death","set","countless","cheap","joke","reggi","horni","sever","refer","film","fly","ball","haha","oh","get","ball","mayb","crow","get","kick","thi","joke","thei","u"],"filtered2":["loath","origin","phantasm","wonder","ambianc","mysteri","like","mani","horror","flick","look","feel","like","creepi","unfinish","documentari","phantasm","ii","late","pump","action","maintain","nice","attent","mood","sadli","phantasm","iii","aw","tedious","explain","weird","happen","previou","diminish","rather","expand","power","shamelessli","degrad","imageri","phantasm","like","cheap","reenact","origin","mani","fly","sphere","seem","like","household","pest","menac","death","orb","hundr","hang","ceil","like","christma","ball","swai","draft","anyon","prop","master","dp","editor","director","notic","care","look","crummi","even","wrong","phantasm","iii","present","corni","unfunni","joke","anoth","differ","intens","origin","phantasm","us","humor","reliev","relentless","focu","death","phantasm","iii","us","death","set","countless","cheap","joke","reggi","horni","sever","refer","fly","ball","haha","oh","get","ball","mayb","crow","get","kick","joke","u"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,16,25,35,43,50,56,58,69,73,83,94,109,112,129,138,150,158,160,163,175,204,205,214,234,245,257,262,316,351,365,369,395,403,411,619,624,625,636,652,688,706,715,748,755,768,784,848,869,948,1059,1129,1169,1309,1328,1350,1485,1820,2056,2361,2518,2570,2578,2694,2975,3377,3908,4407,4413,4414,4515,4560,4635,4673,4772,4994,5049,5455,5484,5564,5822,6062,6655,7464],"values":[5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,16,25,35,43,50,56,58,69,73,83,94,109,112,129,138,150,158,160,163,175,204,205,214,234,245,257,262,316,351,365,369,395,403,411,619,624,625,636,652,688,706,715,748,755,768,784,848,869,948,1059,1129,1169,1309,1328,1350,1485,1820,2056,2361,2518,2570,2578,2694,2975,3377,3908,4407,4413,4414,4515,4560,4635,4673,4772,4994,5049,5455,5484,5564,5822,6062,6655,7464],"values":[3.230191472788289,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,2.393227744058217,1.2796387880827016,1.463169012899134,1.6608112036218214,3.43598877114071,3.7221218701403576,1.865701314626681,6.381097563453174,1.8950689206770979,2.292318797740072,2.08112281984698,2.125691139326857,2.2

{"value":"This movie stinks! You will want back the two-plus hours it takes to get through it. Sliding Doors, w/ Gwyenth Paltrow and directed by Peter Howit, did what Melinda & Melinda tries to do much much MUCH better. That movie was clever, witty, and well-acted. I cared about what happened to both Gwyenths -- or rather the characters she played -- and the performances by supporting cast were fantastic.<br /><br />Where as Melinda & Melinda is tiresome, the dialogue is contrived and I could have cared less about any of these people -- least of all Melinda. One Melinda is so dysfunctional -- her first glass of wine is at 10 a.m. -- and so melodramatic she is laughable, and not in the comedic sense. The 2nd Melinda is fine, but forgettable.<br /><br />Woody Allen's previous ensemble movies worked because, I'm guessing, he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented. One piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months: you can tell. And while Chloe Sevigny is talented -- those around her are not, not enough to be a whole presence. The movie ends up being Chloe Sevigny and a bunch of other people you know you've seen in other movies but can't quite remember which ones.<br /><br />Sad, very sad.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","stink","you","will","want","back","the","twoplu","hour","it","take","to","get","through","it","slide","door","w","gwyenth","paltrow","and","direct","by","peter","howit","do","what","melinda","melinda","try","to","do","much","much","much","well","that","movi","be","clever","witti","and","wellact","i","care","about","what","happen","to","both","gwyenth","or","rather","the","charact","she","plai","and","the","perform","by","support","cast","be","fantasticbr","br","where","a","melinda","melinda","be","tiresom","the","dialogu","be","contriv","and","i","can","have","care","littl","about","ani","of","thi","peopl","littl","of","all","melinda","on","melinda","be","so","dysfunct","her","glass","of","wine","be","at","be","and","so","melodramat","she","be","laughabl","and","not","in","the","comed","sens","the","nd","melinda","be","fine","but","forgettablebr","br","woodi","allen","previou","ensembl","movi","work","becaus","i","be","guess","he","spend","time","on","the","screenplai","and","the","actor","be","talent","on","piec","of","trivium","for","thi","movi","be","that","he","write","thi","screenplai","in","two","month","you","can","tell","and","while","chloe","sevigni","be","talent","that","around","her","be","not","not","enough","to","be","a","whole","presenc","the","movi","end","up","be","chloe","sevigni","and","a","bunch","of","other","peopl","you","know","you","have","see","in","other","movi","but","ca","not","quit","rememb","which","onesbr","br","sad","veri","sad"],"filtered":["thi","movi","stink","want","back","twoplu","hour","take","get","slide","door","w","gwyenth","paltrow","direct","peter","howit","melinda","melinda","try","much","much","much","well","movi","clever","witti","wellact","care","happen","gwyenth","rather","charact","plai","perform","support","cast","fantasticbr","br","melinda","melinda","tiresom","dialogu","contriv","care","littl","ani","thi","peopl","littl","melinda","melinda","dysfunct","glass","wine","melodramat","laughabl","comed","sens","nd","melinda","fine","forgettablebr","br","woodi","allen","previou","ensembl","movi","work","becaus","guess","spend","time","screenplai","actor","talent","piec","trivium","thi","movi","write","thi","screenplai","two","month","tell","chloe","sevigni","talent","around","enough","whole","presenc","movi","end","chloe","sevigni","bunch","peopl","know","see","movi","ca","quit","rememb","onesbr","br","sad","veri","sad"],"filtered2":["stink","want","back","twoplu","hour","take","get","slide","door","w","gwyenth","paltrow","direct","peter","howit","melinda","melinda","try","well","clever","witti","wellact","care","happen","gwyenth","rather","charact","plai","perform","support","cast","fantasticbr","melinda","melinda","tiresom","dialogu","contriv","care","littl","ani","peopl","littl","melinda","melinda","dysfunct","glass","wine","melodramat","laughabl","comed","sens","nd","melinda","fine","forgettablebr","woodi","allen","previou","ensembl","work","becaus","guess","spend","time","screenplai","actor","talent","piec","trivium","write","screenplai","two","month","tell","chloe","sevigni","talent","around","enough","whole","presenc","end","chloe","sevigni","bunch","peopl","know","see","ca","quit","rememb","onesbr","sad","veri","sad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,10,14,15,20,22,23,24,26,27,31,36,37,40,41,47,48,63,65,81,90,92,93,94,98,102,105,111,120,160,173,174,205,218,243,248,276,283,290,419,455,459,464,552,703,760,784,838,955,1159,1180,1231,1345,1409,1682,1761,1777,2274,2387,2803,2915,3319,3397,3501,3554,4310,4481,4926,5490,6660,7168,7995,8154],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,10,14,15,20,22,23,24,26,27,31,36,37,40,41,47,48,63,65,81,90,92,93,94,98,102,105,111,120,160,173,174,205,218,243,248,276,283,290,419,455,459,464,552,703,760,784,838,955,1159,1180,1231,1345,1409,1682,1761,1777,2274,2387,2803,2915,3319,3397,3501,3554,4310,4481,4926,5490,6660,7168,7995,8154],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,1.8729627573220065,1.9073850067444174,1.949757232424728,2.0477128419653545,2.0489535369135887,2.035389827120098,2.08112281984698,2.0881990796736947,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.1183455303375887,2.2044500422972613,2.3722295531801256,2.4368824319140248,2.456282578459816,5.143705159219666,2.5940874818617203,2.627841366673578,2.689504733779216,5.576945901169839,2.7

{"value":"Unless you are geeky film student who has to see everything, this film will not only be a waste of your time and money and a huge disappointment, but it will also make you angry beyond belief.<br /><br />There might be a story worth telling somewhere inside, but Hopkins decided to hide it and encode under so many incessant chaotic layers of apparently random audio video microcuts, making the viewer's patience run thin after a very short while.<br /><br />Why would someone like Hopkins choose such a heavy, most difficult and highly unstable project as his first script, first score and third film can by anyones guess. Maybe he played with it in his mind for such a long time until it became unrecognizable as what it became, not even for himself. The result proves that he has by far not enough experience or skill to achieve the desired result.<br /><br />Even the weirdest Carpenter and Lynch films, to name just two uncoventional filmmakers, had 90% more coherence, 95% less characters and 99% more story flow.<br /><br />Sir Anthony you aimed for the stars, but unfortunately missed by a couple of light years.

{"value":"Space Camp, which had the unfortunate luck to be planned around the time of the Challenger accident, deserves such luck. The \"stars\" make a mockery of acting, Lea Thomson actually being turned sideways, when asked for more than her usual wide-eyed innocent smile, presumably to mask her risible attempts. The movie is at times hilarious, when it begins to ask far too much of you. A small boy keeps a multi-million dollar robot in his closet which breaks when given too many commands by the hordes of cliched dorm-mates. This hackneyed and unlovable machine, \"Jinx\", is a major player in the ridiculous premise of the movie, which seems part Short Circuit, part 2001 by the Airplane team. I shan't bore you with this, suffice it to say you can only laugh when faced with it. Having said all of this, it is enjoyable to watch, in a SeaQuest, Saved by the Bell kind of way. The romance and technology, beware, are as unbelievable as each other. Also, if you're an eighties freak, its unmissable for the amusing performances of Kate Capshaw (Willie from Temple of Doom) and, obviously, Lea Thompson. Also, Joaquin Phoenix puts in a dodgy turn as a sort of wannabe Goonie who befriends Jinx. Do not go near this movie if you are not a fan of

{"value":"I grew up Baptist and I know the story this movie is trying to tell, although I no longer believe the story. I'll give the movie kudos for being as good as the average Lifetime Movie of the Week. Mildly interesting, mediocre acting, a bit slow, the script is predictable, the music is sappy, and it is a bit melodramatic. And all the people left behind have got to be the squeakiest clean non-Christians, ever. Not a single curse word from any of them. But I laughed out loud when the actor playing the man who runs the United Nations pronounced \"nuclear\" as \"nu-cu-ler,\" just like Bush. Is there some Christian code of honor that mandates that since Bush claims he, too, is called by God, that all Christians must cover up his ignorance by mispronouncing that word the same way he does? LOL! I really had a difficult time taking the movie seriously at all after that. After the \"nu-cu-ler\" incident, the movie began to feel like packaged, manipulative propaganda. I was looking for something bold. Actually, I was looking for something that might make me think, but I didn't find it here.

{"value":"I live in Salt Lake City and I'm not a Mormon, so why did I rent this movie? Well because I live in Utah and thought it'd be nice to see locations I know in a film. I really knew going into it that I wasn't going to get the inside jokes so I wasn't surprised when I sat with the deer in the headlights stare. What I was surprised at was the ant-non Mormon actions that were placed in this film.<br /><br />I know it's a Mormon film, catered to the members of the LDS Church, but I found it offensive because of the typical stereotype of people that isn't of their faith. Every non Mormon, which wasn't many, drank, smoked and had an amazing selfishness attitude, why?<br /><br />That really ticked me off about this film, they made the Mormons so pure, yet the rest of the state of Utah I guess is filled with punk psychos just because they don't follow the scriptures of the LDS Church.<br /><br />I can understand having the plots revolve around all LDS members, but you'd think Salt Lake City was 100% Mormon, which isn't even close to being the truth. And as I said, the non Mormons in the movie were portrayed as drunken jerks, please!<br /><br />I guess I just don't get it because I don't belong to their faith and I guess I never will.","finished_norm":["i","live","in","salt","lake","citi","and","i","be","not","a","mormon","so","why","do","i","rend","thi","movi","good","becaus","i","live","in","utah","and","think","it","have","be","nice","to","see","locat","i","know","in","a","film","i","realli","know","go","into","it","that","i","be","not","go","to","get","the","insid","joke","so","i","be","not","surpris","when","i","sit","with","the","deer","in","the","headlight","stare","what","i","be","surpris","at","be","the","antnon","mormon","action","that","be","place","in","thi","filmbr","br","i","know","it","a","mormon","film","cater","to","the","member","of","the","ld","church","but","i","find","it","offens","becaus","of","the","typic","stereotyp","of","peopl","that","be","not","of","their","faith","everi","non","mormon","which","be","not","mani","drink","smoke","and","have","a","amaz","selfish","attitud","whybr","br","that","realli","tick","me","off","about","thi","film","thei","make","the","mormon","so","pure","yet","the","rest","of","the","state","of","utah","i","guess","be","fill","with","punk","psycho","just","becaus","thei","do","not","follow","the","scriptur","of","the","ld","churchbr","br","i","can","understand","have","the","plot","revolv","around","all","ld","member","but","you","have","think","salt","lake","citi","be","mormon","which","be","not","even","close","to","be","the","truth","and","a","i","sai","the","non","mormon","in","the","movi","be","portrai","a","drunken","jerk","pleasebr","br","i","guess","i","just","do","not","get","it","becaus","i","do","not","belong","to","their","faith","and","i","guess","i","never","will"],"filtered":["live","salt","lake","citi","mormon","rend","thi","movi","good","becaus","live","utah","think","nice","see","locat","know","film","realli","know","go","go","get","insid","joke","surpris","sit","deer","headlight","stare","surpris","antnon","mormon","action","place","thi","filmbr","br","know","mormon","film","cater","member","ld","church","find","offens","becaus","typic","stereotyp","peopl","faith","everi","non","mormon","mani","drink","smoke","amaz","selfish","attitud","whybr","br","realli","tick","thi","film","thei","make","mormon","pure","yet","rest","state","utah","guess","fill","punk","psycho","becaus","thei","follow","scriptur","ld","churchbr","br","understand","plot","revolv","around","ld","member","think","salt","lake","citi","mormon","even","close","truth","sai","non","mormon","movi","portrai","drunken","jerk","pleasebr","br","guess","get","becaus","belong","faith","guess","never"],"filtered2":["live","salt","lake","citi","mormon","rend","good","becaus","live","utah","think","nice","see","locat","know","realli","know","go","go","get","insid","joke","surpris","sit","deer","headlight","stare","surpris","antnon","mormon","action","place","filmbr","know","mormon","cater","member","ld","church","find","offens","becaus","typic","stereotyp","peopl","faith","everi","non","mormon","mani","drink","smoke","amaz","selfish","attitud","whybr","realli","tick","make","mormon","pure","yet","rest","state","utah","guess","fill","punk","psycho","becaus","follow","scriptur","ld","churchbr","understand","plot","revolv","around","ld","member","think","salt","lake","citi","mormon","even","close","truth","non","mormon","portrai","drunken","jerk","pleasebr","guess","get","becaus","belong","faith","guess","never"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,12,13,22,23,26,32,38,42,50,85,98,116,129,164,194,212,214,226,243,244,260,262,295,326,469,498,533,553,566,595,604,613,618,667,685,726,758,775,890,1072,1130,1145,1438,1500,1540,1558,1562,1725,1822,1918,2606,2674,2822,3003,3056,4057,4441,4690,4763,5037,5687,5824,8165],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,12,13,22,23,26,32,38,42,50,85,98,116,129,164,194,212,214,226,243,244,260,262,295,326,469,498,533,553,566,595,604,613,618,667,685,726,758,775,890,1072,1130,1145,1438,1500,1540,1558,1562,1725,1822,1918,2606,2674,2822,3003,3056,4057,4441,4690,4763,5037,5687,5824,8165],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,2.133457220525776,2.2635883139467947,5.191696066944709,1.364847727375781,3.9974772509130565,1.3711311285073675,1.519311641348122,1.6219954307453837,1.717994385570355,2.011190219103739,2.0881990796736947,4.493325799357863,2.4106958340079214,2.3930275298746078,2.5378812223426954,2.5983793339432615,2.7303758068497004,2.5940874818617203,7.8835241000207334,2.634508058031767,2.6754694156628323,2.726701583487816,2.7910771187233068,5.885680771176112,3.328770687675578,3.386191741044285,3.424750734647968,3.454678155189441,3.439602492783994,7.256857902348149,3.5727776966246974

{"value":"Five-year-old Michael sees his mother getting axed to death by his serial killer father \"The Highwayman,\" who later commits suicide. \"20 years later\" grown Mike (Gordon Currie, from PUPPET MASTER 4 and 5) invites seven of his friends to his secluded grandparents home to \"master their own fears\" at a Halloween night costume party. Morty, a life-size wooden doll kept in the attic by the Indian handyman, becomes possessed by the dead father's spirit and kills them off using their phobias. Characters are thrown out a window, drowned in a toilet, eaten by rats, blown up, etc. Morty morphs into the dad and a tree, walks around and makes stupid wisecracks. After finding a girl chopped up and stuffed in a cardboard box, the characters remain in the house, act cheerful, crack jokes and have sex.<br /><br />The Morty design is good and Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees from the original Friday THE 13TH) is surprisingly delightful as the grandmother, but this thing is even more senseless and confusing than the original and is full of false scares, bad acting, brain-dead characters, repeat flashback footage and annoying distorted camera-work.

{"value":"Please, help the economy - spend your money elsewhere! The synopsis of the movie is: the First Lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her. That's it. Undetected by anyone, except Cuba and Angie, she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about...and gets away completely free.<br /><br />Some specific points are particularly hilarious: While standing in front of the president, Cuba a deflects the assassin's bullet...which then enters the back of the president's head.<br /><br />Cuba and Angie watch film from a news camera, and they see...a clue. They go to great lengths to protect the film, believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film.<br /><br />Cuba speaks with a presidential staff member. The PSM comments that there was no conspiracy. Cuba claims there was more than one person involved. The PSM then rants that the conspiracy includes the FBI, the CIA, and the NSA.

{"value":"So, American Pie: Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series. Although, it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Eugene Levy is in it (can't that guy get better gigs?).<br /><br />There is very little to compliment this movie on. There aren't any funny jokes. The acting is painful to watch, especially the girl with the \"southern\" accent which sounds more like a Canadian's impersonation of a British woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word \"ya'll.\" This movie makes me feel like such an idiot. Why didn't I apply to a college where nobody goes to class (but everybody gets good grades), girls consistently take their clothes off in public, everybody has promiscuous unprotected sex without the burden of babies and STIs, and you can ejaculate all over a girl's family photos without her minding? Really, this series has lowered itself to the standards of softcore porn. Maybe for the next one, they'll finally break down and hire Ron Jeremy as the lead. I'm sure they can just tie it in to the series by making his character Stifler's 3rd uncle once removed or something like

{"value":"For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I cannot believe what these people did to a perfectly good play. <br /><br />-Let's start off with the good bit, shall we?-<br /><br />Alan Rickman is alright, although some of his dialog could have been delivered with more feeling. The rest of the actors needed to pull it together. <br /><br />Romeo, Romeo, whyfore art thou not dead yet, Romeo? The actor, while not only completely wooden and deadpan, could not read his lines with any gusto at all. He was completely out of focus, had difficulty even looking Juliet in the face, and absolutely NO grace with the lines that he was given. Whoever cast him deserves to be punished. Juliet is almost passable, but she gives no depth to her character,and seems to be completely out of touch with the play. Mercutio was incredibly creepy and completely out of character for the entirety of his dialog. Benvolio was unfeeling and mercilessly choppy with his lines. <br /><br />I was forced to endure this half-baked production of Romeo and Juliet. The acting was stilted and the costumes were nothing short of distracting. I have seen kindergarten puppet shows with more effort put into them. I only wish that i could give this movie a rating of zero.","finished_norm":["for","my","tast","of","shakespear","on","stage","i","cannot","believ","what","thi","peopl","do","to","a","perfectli","good","plai","br","br","let","start","off","with","the","good","bite","shall","webr","br","alan","rickman","be","alright","although","some","of","hi","dialog","can","have","be","deliv","with","much","feel","the","rest","of","the","actor","ne","to","pull","it","togeth","br","br","romeo","romeo","whyfor","art","thou","not","dead","yet","romeo","the","actor","while","not","onli","complet","wooden","and","deadpan","can","not","read","hi","line","with","ani","gusto","at","all","he","be","complet","out","of","focu","have","difficulti","even","look","juliet","in","the","face","and","absolut","no","grace","with","the","line","that","he","be","give","whoever","cast","him","deserv","to","be","punish","juliet","be","almost","passabl","but","she","give","no","depth","to","her","characterand","seem","to","be","complet","out","of","touch","with","the","plai","mercutio","be","incredibli","creepi","and","complet","out","of","charact","for","the","entireti","of","hi","dialog","benvolio","be","unfeel","and","mercilessli","choppi","with","hi","line","br","br","i","be","forc","to","endur","thi","halfbak","product","of","romeo","and","juliet","the","act","be","stilt","and","the","costum","be","noth","short","of","distract","i","have","see","kindergarten","puppet","show","with","much","effort","put","into","them","i","onli","wish","that","i","can","give","thi","movi","a","rate","of","zero"],"filtered":["tast","shakespear","stage","believ","thi","peopl","perfectli","good","plai","br","br","let","start","good","bite","shall","webr","br","alan","rickman","alright","although","hi","dialog","deliv","much","feel","rest","actor","ne","pull","togeth","br","br","romeo","romeo","whyfor","art","thou","dead","yet","romeo","actor","onli","complet","wooden","deadpan","read","hi","line","ani","gusto","complet","focu","difficulti","even","look","juliet","face","absolut","grace","line","give","whoever","cast","deserv","punish","juliet","almost","passabl","give","depth","characterand","seem","complet","touch","plai","mercutio","incredibli","creepi","complet","charact","entireti","hi","dialog","benvolio","unfeel","mercilessli","choppi","hi","line","br","br","forc","endur","thi","halfbak","product","romeo","juliet","act","stilt","costum","noth","short","distract","see","kindergarten","puppet","show","much","effort","put","onli","wish","give","thi","movi","rate","zero"],"filtered2":["tast","shakespear","stage","believ","peopl","perfectli","good","plai","let","start","good","bite","shall","webr","alan","rickman","alright","although","dialog","deliv","feel","rest","actor","ne","pull","togeth","romeo","romeo","whyfor","art","thou","dead","yet","romeo","actor","onli","complet","wooden","deadpan","read","line","ani","gusto","complet","focu","difficulti","even","look","juliet","face","absolut","grace","line","give","whoever","cast","deserv","punish","juliet","almost","passabl","give","depth","characterand","seem","complet","touch","plai","mercutio","incredibli","creepi","complet","charact","entireti","dialog","benvolio","unfeel","mercilessli","choppi","line","forc","endur","halfbak","product","romeo","juliet","act","stilt","costum","noth","short","distract","see","kindergarten","puppet","show","effort","put","onli","wish","give","rate","zero"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,10,11,16,21,23,27,28,30,35,40,41,43,49,71,91,92,103,107,110,124,131,145,154,159,190,194,202,222,226,228,237,251,270,272,338,382,399,401,423,432,517,544,619,669,687,745,755,776,872,891,914,964,1149,1356,1475,1551,1604,1609,1762,1845,2277,2428,2700,2909,3064,3124,3680,4639,5167,5495,6210,6713,6813,7369,7993],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,10,11,16,21,23,27,28,30,35,40,41,43,49,71,91,92,103,107,110,124,131,145,154,159,190,194,202,222,226,228,237,251,270,272,338,382,399,401,423,432,517,544,619,669,687,745,755,776,872,891,914,964,1149,1356,1475,1551,1604,1609,1762,1845,2277,2428,2700,2909,3064,3124,3680,4639,5167,5495,6210,6713,6813,7369,7993],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.1238870241028365,1.982619630677639,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,4.009325967515556,1.463169012899134,3.2569937516641474,3.1375198335242067,1.6608112036218214,1.6920303308087352,1.9214926742550966,2.0105926690411424,2.0489535369135887,8.394328164874995,6.431860195918187,2.1290479736304078,2.2323930368088845,2.2512118082053005,2.34599021453259,2.348499626138016,2.300267965194495,2.558331832813986,2.5378812223426954,2.5973046428

{"value":"Wow, how bad can it get. This was seriously bad. Not in terms of the gore - which was mainly laughable CGI - but in acting, atmosphere and direction.<br /><br />The story was dreadful - the character arc of the main lead was a total joke. Within a few nights of stalking Vinnie Jones, he starts to become 'haunted' to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend. Um... are all New York photographers this childish, suggestible and weak? His character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever - and by the very end you'll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable, and totally absurd twist his character takes.<br /><br />The gory moments were clearly just a weak, low-self-esteemed effort to jump onto the modern MTV style gore wagon - all cgi, blood yet no real emotion whatsoever. These parts were unintentionally funny - and distracting by their self-consciousness - wacky camera angles etc.<br /><br />Overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea. What could have had atmosphere (until the stupid monsters at the end) is ruined in favour of 'look at me'style self-conscious directing.

{"value":"...and it is this film. I imagine that if indeed there is a negative afterlife, damned souls are tied to a rather uncomfortable couch and forced to watch this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. <br /><br />Okay, maybe it's not that bad, but it is probably the worst film I have ever seen next to \"Manos, the Hands of Fate\"... and I have seen a lot of bad movies, believe you me. <br /><br />This is just a crummy B movie, bad film-making at it's finest(or is it worst?) The thing I really didn't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief. Now, a little comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons, rather than on the \"heroes\" of this film, who are actually in it for less time than them! <br /><br />To be fair, Crown International really destroyed the movie by adding bad music and doing a poor job editing. But honestly, this was probably a bad film to begin with, so Crown really couldn't have done that much to hurt it. <br /><br />This really needs to be in the bottom 100 list. I wouldn't wish this one on my worst enemy. <br /><br />Actually, it's my kind of campy B movie.

{"value":"This movie has one redeeming feature. At one point, after a character is attacked by an ax-wielding fairy, his brother asks him, \"Why is your dick over there, Chuck?\" After suffering through almost an hour of bad film, this almost made my drink come out my nose.<br /><br />Some of the acting isn't too bad, but the kids all stink and P. J. Soles should be ashamed of herself for doing this film. The story is weak and nobody does what you think (or what common sense dictates) they should.<br /><br />Of course, there are a lot of story points that don't add up. For example, in one scene the ghosts of young children must concentrate hard to move a physical object so they can prove they exist, a difficult feat since they apparently can't interact with physical matter. However, minutes later they all pick up branches off the ground and beat the Tooth Fairy with them. Apparently they CAN sometimes move matter and sometimes they CAN'T. Go figure.<br /><br />Lots of blood and guts, though...a few nice boobs. But this doesn't make up for the deficiencies.<br /><br />If you want a movie about the Tooth Fairy, go rent \"Darkness Falls\". I think it's great, though a lot of other reviewers don't share my opinion.

{"value":"This early Adam Sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989. His character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from Sandler than the script. The film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films, such as Big Daddy or even the corny Billy Maddison. Unfortunately, Sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character. The majority of the film's \"jokes\" come from Sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't get women. The film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film. Sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. The film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. I immediately wanted to forget I even saw this film after it was over, for fear that if more found out about it, it would ruin Sandler's career.

{"value":"I'm a great admirer of Lon Chaney, but the screen writing of this movie just did not work for me. The story jumps around oddly (I've since learned that the film is missing a section), and characters appear and disappear with irritating suddenness. Some of the intertitles are overly explanatory (e.g., \"why, you're not a child anymore!\"--cut back to picture for a long, slow beat--\"you're a woman!\" yes, we got it the first time) but there are a few talking sequences that beg for explanations that never appear. (Let's hear Luigi and his blond girlfriend's argument, please!) The plot, which involves incestuous desires (figuratively if not technically) was disturbing to the point that it was hard to watch. To the writer's credit, this issue was treated as a problem, and a May-December match is not portrayed as the right-and-good inevitability of some Mary Pickford films (e.g., \"Daddy-Long-Legs\"). Chaney gives a good performance, as usual, but I think he has been better-directed in the past--he overdid it a few times here, IMHO. I did enjoy the clown sequences, and was very impressed at the stunts. Loretta Young was charming, though astonishingly young. The film has its moments, but so far, it's my least-favorite Chaney picture.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","great","admir","of","lon","chanei","but","the","screen","write","of","thi","movi","just","do","not","work","for","me","the","stori","jump","around","oddli","i","have","sinc","learn","that","the","film","be","miss","a","section","and","charact","appear","and","disappear","with","irrit","sudden","some","of","the","intertitl","be","overli","explanatori","eg","why","you","re","not","a","child","anymorecut","back","to","pictur","for","a","long","slow","beatyour","a","woman","ye","we","get","it","the","time","but","there","be","a","few","talk","sequenc","that","beg","for","explan","that","never","appear","let","hear","luigi","and","hi","blond","girlfriend","argum","pleas","the","plot","which","involv","incestu","desir","figur","if","not","technic","be","disturb","to","the","point","that","it","be","hard","to","watch","to","the","writer","credit","thi","issu","be","treat","a","a","problem","and","a","maydecemb","match","be","not","portrai","a","the","rightandgood","inevit","of","some","mari","pickford","film","eg","daddylongleg","chanei","give","a","good","perform","a","usual","but","i","think","he","have","be","betterdirect","in","the","pasth","overdo","it","a","few","time","here","imho","i","do","enjoi","the","clown","sequenc","and","be","veri","impress","at","the","stunt","loretta","young","be","charm","though","astonishingli","young","the","film","have","it","moment","but","so","far","it","my","leastfavorit","chanei","pictur"],"filtered":["great","admir","lon","chanei","screen","write","thi","movi","work","stori","jump","around","oddli","sinc","learn","film","miss","section","charact","appear","disappear","irrit","sudden","intertitl","overli","explanatori","eg","re","child","anymorecut","back","pictur","long","slow","beatyour","woman","ye","get","time","talk","sequenc","beg","explan","never","appear","let","hear","luigi","hi","blond","girlfriend","argum","pleas","plot","involv","incestu","desir","figur","technic","disturb","point","hard","watch","writer","credit","thi","issu","treat","problem","maydecemb","match","portrai","rightandgood","inevit","mari","pickford","film","eg","daddylongleg","chanei","give","good","perform","usual","think","betterdirect","pasth","overdo","time","imho","enjoi","clown","sequenc","veri","impress","stunt","loretta","young","charm","though","astonishingli","young","film","moment","far","leastfavorit","chanei","pictur"],"filtered2":["great","admir","lon","chanei","screen","write","work","stori","jump","around","oddli","sinc","learn","miss","section","charact","appear","disappear","irrit","sudden","intertitl","overli","explanatori","eg","re","child","anymorecut","back","pictur","long","slow","beatyour","woman","ye","get","time","talk","sequenc","beg","explan","never","appear","let","hear","luigi","blond","girlfriend","argum","pleas","plot","involv","incestu","desir","figur","technic","disturb","point","hard","watch","writer","credit","issu","treat","problem","maydecemb","match","portrai","rightandgood","inevit","mari","pickford","eg","daddylongleg","chanei","give","good","perform","usual","think","betterdirect","pasth","overdo","time","imho","enjoi","clown","sequenc","veri","impress","stunt","loretta","young","charm","though","astonishingli","young","moment","far","leastfavorit","chanei","pictur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,8,10,12,15,17,30,32,42,48,51,63,65,66,68,70,86,98,99,101,105,124,135,162,167,170,171,180,186,188,192,200,209,216,241,255,265,287,311,346,349,356,390,415,418,431,469,674,730,797,806,839,849,919,921,944,958,985,1000,1182,1203,1273,1544,1716,1784,1876,1966,1977,1993,2170,2244,2252,2259,4909,6426,6802,7306,7639,7975],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,8,10,12,15,17,30,32,42,48,51,63,65,66,68,70,86,98,99,101,105,124,135,162,167,170,171,180,186,188,192,200,209,216,241,255,265,287,311,346,349,356,390,415,418,431,469,674,730,797,806,839,849,919,921,944,958,985,1000,1182,1203,1273,1544,1716,1784,1876,1966,1977,1993,2170,2244,2252,2259,4909,6426,6802,7306,7639,7975],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.6219954307453837,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,1.8729627573220065,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,2.094675786251684,2.031112399272319,2.0881990796736947,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.1765612129984904,2.2323930368088845,4.732488142874176,2.3586007221245198,2.4609576687888097,4.842897251568367,2.373087554090762,2.7097314792693545,2.571852579609833,2.5378812223426954,2.

{"value":"This review also contains a spoiler of the first movie -- so if you haven't seen either movie and want to but don't want the spoilers, please don't read this review!<br /><br />While this movie is supposed to be about Christian and Kathryn meeting for the first time, the movie is a poor copy of the first Cruel Intentions. The actors that they had portray Ryan Phillippe's Christian and Sarah Michelle Gellar's Kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed. Neither can pull off the smarmy, snooty rich-kid attitude that the original actors did. It's absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim -- not so much between Christian and Kathryn, but if you listen closely enough you'll recognize it. There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie? He supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie (with Reese Witherspoon's character).<br /><br />Also, the tie-in with the photography/\"You could be a model\" comment at the end was totally lame and didn't add anything at all.

{"value":"I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as \"The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen\".<br /><br />Even if you ignore the dodgy accents, low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it. I only went to see it as I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film.<br /><br />The simple answer is - they didn't. Characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative. Even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it's climax you don't care what happens to any of them.<br /><br />I can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from. But after my friends and I came out of the cinema I had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened.<br /><br />They even change the true meaning of the books title \"Rancid Aluminium\" by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title.<br /><br />A real mess of a film from start to

{"value":"This sword-&-sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous \"hero\" vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail. The acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles. The leering, gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting; nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause, since he is as bad as the people he's fighting. Z-movie editing is abundant, including a scene where a character \"dies\" from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely!<br /><br />The movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads, Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson, who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie. As a 20-something male, I will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn't attract me. But the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless, that I couldn't enjoy even this aspect of the movie.<br /><br />Most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek feel (the sequel is better in this regard), but DEATHSTALKER seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy.

{"value":"Note to all mad scientists everywhere: if you're going to turn your son into a genetically mutated monster, you need to give him a scarier name than \"Paul.\" I don't care if he's a frightening hammerhead shark with a mouthful of dagger-sharp teeth and the ability to ambush people in the water as well as on dry land. Give the kid a more worthy name like, \"Thor,\" \"Rock,\" or \"Tiburon.\" Because even if he eats me up I will probably just sit there laughing, \"Ha! Get a load of this!!! Paul the Monster is ripping me to shreds!!!!!\" That's the worst part about this movie is, this shark-thing is referred to as \"Paul\" throughout the entire flick. It makes what could have been a decent, scary horror movie just seem silly. Not that there aren't other campy and contrived parts of \"Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy.\" The scientists spend the entire movie wandering along this island, and all of a sudden one of the girls starts itching madly from walking in the lush forest, and just HAS to pour water on her feet to relive the itching, which of course allows \"Paul\" to come out of the water and kill her. The one thing SciFI Channel did right in this movie was let the hottie live. But that's a small silver lining in an otherwise disappointing movie.","finished_norm":["note","to","all","mad","scientist","everywher","if","you","re","go","to","turn","your","son","into","a","genet","mutat","monster","you","ne","to","give","him","a","scari","name","than","paul","i","do","not","care","if","he","a","frighten","hammerhead","shark","with","a","mouth","of","daggersharp","tooth","and","the","abil","to","ambush","peopl","in","the","water","a","good","a","on","spindri","land","give","the","kid","a","much","worthi","name","like","thor","rock","or","tiburon","becaus","even","if","he","eat","me","up","i","will","probabl","just","sit","there","laugh","ha","get","a","load","of","thi","paul","the","monster","be","rip","me","to","shred","that","the","wrong","part","about","thi","movi","be","thi","sharkth","be","refer","to","a","paul","throughout","the","entir","flick","it","make","what","can","have","be","a","decent","scari","horror","movi","just","seem","silli","not","that","there","be","not","other","campi","and","contriv","part","of","hammerhead","shark","frenzi","the","scientist","spend","the","entir","movi","wander","along","thi","island","and","all","of","a","sudden","on","of","the","girl","start","itch","madli","from","walk","in","the","lush","forest","and","just","have","to","pour","water","on","her","foot","to","reliv","the","itch","which","of","cours","allow","paul","to","come","out","of","the","water","and","kill","her","the","on","thing","scifi","channel","do","right","in","thi","movi","be","let","the","hotti","live","but","that","a","small","silver","line","in","a","otherwis","disappoint","movi"],"filtered":["note","mad","scientist","everywher","re","go","turn","son","genet","mutat","monster","ne","give","scari","name","paul","care","frighten","hammerhead","shark","mouth","daggersharp","tooth","abil","ambush","peopl","water","good","spindri","land","give","kid","much","worthi","name","like","thor","rock","tiburon","becaus","even","eat","probabl","sit","laugh","ha","get","load","thi","paul","monster","rip","shred","wrong","part","thi","movi","thi","sharkth","refer","paul","throughout","entir","flick","make","decent","scari","horror","movi","seem","silli","campi","contriv","part","hammerhead","shark","frenzi","scientist","spend","entir","movi","wander","along","thi","island","sudden","girl","start","itch","madli","walk","lush","forest","pour","water","foot","reliv","itch","cours","allow","paul","come","water","kill","thing","scifi","channel","right","thi","movi","let","hotti","live","small","silver","line","otherwis","disappoint","movi"],"filtered2":["note","mad","scientist","everywher","re","go","turn","son","genet","mutat","monster","ne","give","scari","name","paul","care","frighten","hammerhead","shark","mouth","daggersharp","tooth","abil","ambush","peopl","water","good","spindri","land","give","kid","worthi","name","like","thor","rock","tiburon","becaus","even","eat","probabl","sit","laugh","ha","get","load","paul","monster","rip","shred","wrong","part","sharkth","refer","paul","throughout","entir","flick","make","decent","scari","horror","seem","silli","campi","contriv","part","hammerhead","shark","frenzi","scientist","spend","entir","wander","along","island","sudden","girl","start","itch","madli","walk","lush","forest","pour","water","foot","reliv","itch","cours","allow","paul","come","water","kill","thing","scifi","channel","right","let","hotti","live","small","silver","line","otherwis","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,22,23,25,29,30,34,35,61,68,71,76,83,84,96,107,110,114,116,121,124,133,143,148,187,198,199,205,244,257,283,294,309,324,363,385,396,413,434,438,521,560,582,599,627,715,719,728,781,805,825,830,831,840,847,870,941,981,1180,1212,1242,1296,1337,1447,1637,1701,1710,1734,1784,1903,2105,2115,2976,3258,3631,3710,5010,5221,5793,7028,7718,7990],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,22,23,25,29,30,34,35,61,68,71,76,83,84,96,107,110,114,116,121,124,133,143,148,187,198,199,205,244,257,283,294,309,324,363,385,396,413,434,438,521,560,582,599,627,715,719,728,781,805,825,830,831,840,847,870,941,981,1180,1212,1242,1296,1337,1447,1637,1701,1710,1734,1784,1903,2105,2115,2976,3258,3631,3710,5010,5221,5793,7028,7718,7990],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,2.6728839783437044,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,3.7637034094785053,2.0064197866819473,1.9214926742550966,2.1337665533324026,2.292318797740072,2.2212694515902225,2.0390708128715254,2.1439533986393955,2.1290479736304078,2.443307

{"value":"Unless you are petrified of Russian people or boars, this movie is a snorefest. Actually, I fell asleep about 40 minutes in & had to fight the urge to just leave the theater. I wish I had. A waste of a perfectly lovely Saturday evening.<br /><br />Even \"Silent Hill\" was scarier. Heck, even \"Pan's Labyrinth\" was scarier. I'm still unclear on what was supposed to be scary in this flick.<br /><br />To begin with, I'm very leery of movies that use \"pidgin Russian\" like this one did in the opening credits. It's embarrassing to me since I brought a group of my Russian friends & we all cringed. Oh my god.<br /><br />Hmm. Well, luckily for me (& probably you, too) this movie has already escaped my brain & I just stepped out of it an hour ago. So I have no specifics, just murky visuals that go nowhere & some languishing-now-dead hope that anything would happen.<br /><br />Perhaps I saw a completely mutilated version of this film because I can't believe it got such great reviews here (which is why I saw it) & ended up being so completely devoid of not only Horror or Suspense but Overall Entertainment Value as well.<br /><br />I give it a 2 because, yes, I fell asleep & wanted to leave after 40 minutes but I woke up & didn't

{"value":"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only lacks any acting skill, but the script is incredibly shallow and lame. You actually hear serious dialogue that goes, \"I love you more.\" \"No, I love YOU more.\" I stopped watching the movie (online) after the first half hour, I couldn't take it anymore. Her \"southern girl charm\" just doesn't work and is really quite annoying; her attempts at slapstick humor fall flat and she delivers lines like she is reading the script right off the page.<br /><br />Poor Luke Wilson. Did he not read the script before agreeing to do this, or did he fall for Papa Joe's (Jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie) promise of big profits? Hopefully he now knows better than to sign on to another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I hate seeing the pained look on his face as he suffers through the bad dialogue.<br /><br />Also, I think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow or hired by Papa Joe to give the movie a better rating. No one in their right mind would actually find this movie engaging.<br /><br />Jessica has lots of money, right?

{"value":"I must preface this by saying I am a huge romantic. Hence I really wanted to like this film. So I'm writing my thoughts to save the rest of you from the disappointment I felt watching it. The Leap Years tells the destiny-filled tale of Li-Ann who falls for the suave Jeremy and they commit to meet every leap year. A very romantic premise, based on a great short story and with a cast that doesn't feel like you're watching yet another Jack Neo flick. Then why oh why is it so bad? Firstly, I feel the filmmakers thought they were shooting a music video, because they chose to replace storytelling and any true emotions with cheesy montages, predictable actions and clichéd lines. I am both upset and embarrassed to have been one of the first few in Singapore to watch The Leap Years, but those of us in the cinema would agree that our muffled groans at the cringe-worthy performances spoke volumes. My hope was to watch a romantic movie that would surpass Forever Fever, the best Singaporean romantic comedy so far, and The Leap Years does not even come close. Some blogs have called it The Crap Years which is harsh but ultimately true. Don't waste your money or your emotions like I did. The movie will make you give up on love
