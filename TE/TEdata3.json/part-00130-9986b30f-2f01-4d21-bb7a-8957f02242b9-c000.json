{"value":"Carl Panzram lived an amazing life and scribbled down his memoirs on scraps of paper for possibly the only person who ever did anything selfless for him. The book \"Panzram: A Journal of Murder\" by Thomas E. Gaddis and James O. Long, which came out the better part of a century after Panzram's death, gives the historical context to a first-generation American's account of running away from home to go west and be a cowboy, getting caught, thrown in the boy's home, getting away repeatedly and thrown into prison over and over all the time getting tortured and sodomized. As Panzram grew huge and strong, he sought to take revenge for the wrong done to him as he traveled to South America, Europe and Africa, and it didn't matter what people he raped, robbed, or murdered because we are all equally worthless.<br /><br />This film casts skinny James Woods as the rough neck, mean-ass, son of a bitch Carl Panzram who in the film is a \"drunk\", overly-dramatic and emotional, and who never mentions the joy of sodomizing men and boys. The film neither elaborates on anything else particularly of note about this world traveler and career prisoner (like robbing former President Taft or being released from the Oregon prison as long as he gave his word to return). In short, I don't think Carl would be too happy.","finished_norm":["carl","panzram","live","a","amaz","life","and","scribbl","down","hi","memoir","on","scrap","of","paper","for","possibli","the","onli","person","who","ever","do","anyth","selfless","for","him","the","book","panzram","a","journal","of","murder","by","thoma","e","gaddi","and","jame","o","long","which","come","out","the","well","part","of","a","centuri","after","panzram","death","give","the","histor","context","to","a","firstgener","american","account","of","run","awai","from","home","to","go","west","and","be","a","cowboi","get","catch","throw","in","the","boi","home","get","awai","repeatedli","and","throw","into","prison","over","and","over","all","the","time","get","tortur","and","sodom","a","panzram","grow","huge","and","strong","he","seek","to","take","reveng","for","the","wrong","do","to","him","a","he","travel","to","south","america","europ","and","africa","and","it","do","not","matt","what","peopl","he","rape","rob","or","murder","becaus","we","be","all","equal","worthlessbr","br","thi","film","cast","skinni","jame","wood","a","the","rough","neck","meanass","son","of","a","bitch","carl","panzram","who","in","the","film","be","a","drink","overlydramat","and","emot","and","who","never","mention","the","joi","of","sodom","man","and","boi","the","film","neither","elabor","on","anyth","els","particularli","of","note","about","thi","world","travel","and","career","prison","like","rob","former","presid","taft","or","be","releas","from","the","oregon","prison","a","long","a","he","give","hi","word","to","return","in","short","i","do","not","think","carl","would","be","too","happi"],"filtered":["carl","panzram","live","amaz","life","scribbl","hi","memoir","scrap","paper","possibli","onli","person","ever","anyth","selfless","book","panzram","journal","murder","thoma","e","gaddi","jame","o","long","come","well","part","centuri","panzram","death","give","histor","context","firstgener","american","account","run","awai","home","go","west","cowboi","get","catch","throw","boi","home","get","awai","repeatedli","throw","prison","time","get","tortur","sodom","panzram","grow","huge","strong","seek","take","reveng","wrong","travel","south","america","europ","africa","matt","peopl","rape","rob","murder","becaus","equal","worthlessbr","br","thi","film","cast","skinni","jame","wood","rough","neck","meanass","son","bitch","carl","panzram","film","drink","overlydramat","emot","never","mention","joi","sodom","man","boi","film","neither","elabor","anyth","els","particularli","note","thi","world","travel","career","prison","like","rob","former","presid","taft","releas","oregon","prison","long","give","hi","word","return","short","think","carl","happi"],"filtered2":["carl","panzram","live","amaz","life","scribbl","memoir","scrap","paper","possibli","onli","person","ever","anyth","selfless","book","panzram","journal","murder","thoma","e","gaddi","jame","o","long","come","well","part","centuri","panzram","death","give","histor","context","firstgener","american","account","run","awai","home","go","west","cowboi","get","catch","throw","boi","home","get","awai","repeatedli","throw","prison","time","get","tortur","sodom","panzram","grow","huge","strong","seek","take","reveng","wrong","travel","south","america","europ","africa","matt","peopl","rape","rob","murder","becaus","equal","worthlessbr","cast","skinni","jame","wood","rough","neck","meanass","son","bitch","carl","panzram","drink","overlydramat","emot","never","mention","joi","sodom","man","boi","neither","elabor","anyth","els","particularli","note","world","travel","career","prison","like","rob","former","presid","taft","releas","oregon","prison","long","give","word","return","short","think","carl","happi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,8,11,12,20,22,23,25,30,31,34,42,44,45,61,75,92,99,104,116,137,151,153,155,165,196,223,245,258,272,273,282,285,302,310,327,408,434,444,488,497,506,511,512,558,560,561,605,620,631,655,667,685,718,746,802,809,852,871,906,953,994,1032,1040,1090,1163,1238,1299,1399,1472,1501,1559,1698,1945,2184,2313,2391,2411,2422,2533,2643,2652,2928,3502,4304,4440,6255,6256,6348],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,8,11,12,20,22,23,25,30,31,34,42,44,45,61,75,92,99,104,116,137,151,153,155,165,196,223,245,258,272,273,282,285,302,310,327,408,434,444,488,497,506,511,512,558,560,561,605,620,631,655,667,685,718,746,802,809,852,871,906,953,994,1032,1040,1090,1163,1238,1299,1399,1472,1501,1559,1698,1945,2184,2313,2391,2411,2422,2533,2643,2652,2928,3502,4304,4440,6255,6256,6348],"values":[0.6460382945576578,2.389902141215977,0.9708269144703846,0.941

{"value":"One of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties, Pranks is notable only for an early performance by Daphne Zuniga (The Sure Thing, The Fly 2); her character dies fairly early on, and the rest of the film is totally forgettable.<br /><br />During their Christmas break, a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture. A crazy killer, however, throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome ways.<br /><br />Exploiting every stalk 'n' slash cliché in the book, director Jeffrey Obrow delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed, so that I could get on with watching something more worthwhile. The majority of the deaths (which, let's face it, is why we generally watch this kind of film) are brief and not that gory; the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor (there is one notably bloody dismembered corpsethe film could've done with more).<br /><br />At the last minute, the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending, but this really is one for slasher completists

{"value":"I am a huge Ziyi Zhang fan and will go to any film to see her which is what took me to Purple Butterfly. As much as I wanted to like this movie, I have to agree with many others who have commented on it. It is very confusing and also extremely slow. Because all of the film appears to have been shot with a hand held camera, significant portions of it are out of focus. <br /><br />The film has very little dialog and what there is doesn't tell you much. There are endless scenes of people just standing around smoking cigarettes or sitting in a room staring at each other with no conversation. The way the film time shifts is also very confusing and hard to follow. Even having read a number of reviews beforehand and having a general idea what the film was about, I still had a difficult time understanding what was going on. <br /><br />I knew beforehand that the movie was not remotely similar to previous Ziyi Zhang starring films but was looking forward to seeing her in something different but unfortunately I was ultimately disappointed. She never smiles in this film although admittedly most of the time she doesn't have anything to smile about. I could have done without the sex scenes as they were about as sexless and without any obvious feeling between the participants as you could hope to

{"value":"Revolt of the Zombies is BAD. There is nothing remotely entertaining about the movie. It is dull, lifeless, poorly acted, and poorly scripted. I've often complained that the original Dracula is a little slow for my taste, well this movie makes Dracula look like a roller coaster ride. The 65 minute running time seemed like 165 minutes.<br /><br />The story: An expedition is sent to Cambodia to find the secrets of mind control through \"zombification\". One man finds the secret and uses it to make the woman he loves marry him. Once this happens, he releases the zombies under his control to horrific consequences. That's it. That's the whole story.<br /><br />For most of the movie, I was trying to figure out where I had seen the male lead. He looked so familiar. I had plenty of time to think this over. Nothing was happening in the movie. Just before the \"zombies revolted\", it hit me. It was Dean Jagger. I had seen him recently as the General in White Christmas. This is how I \"entertained\" myself throughout most of the movie.<br /><br />I'm just glad I didn't buy the DVD for this movie. King of the Zombies is on the other side and it's a masterpiece of film making compared with this movie. For what it's worth, I'll give it a 2/10. (I won't go to 1/10 because, believe it or not, I've seen worse.)","finished_norm":["revolt","of","the","zombi","be","bad","there","be","noth","remot","entertain","about","the","movi","it","be","dull","lifeless","poorli","act","and","poorli","script","i","have","often","complain","that","the","origin","dracula","be","a","littl","slow","for","my","tast","good","thi","movi","make","dracula","look","like","a","roller","coaster","ride","the","minut","run","time","seem","like","minutesbr","br","the","stori","a","expedit","be","send","to","cambodia","to","find","the","secret","of","mind","control","through","zombif","on","man","find","the","secret","and","us","it","to","make","the","woman","he","love","marri","him","onc","thi","happen","he","releas","the","zombi","under","hi","control","to","horrif","consequ","that","it","that","the","whole","storybr","br","for","much","of","the","movi","i","be","try","to","figur","out","where","i","have","see","the","male","lead","he","look","so","familiar","i","have","plenti","of","time","to","think","thi","over","noth","be","happen","in","the","movi","just","befor","the","zombi","revolt","it","hit","me","it","be","dean","jagger","i","have","see","him","recent","a","the","gener","in","white","christma","thi","be","how","i","entertain","myself","throughout","much","of","the","moviebr","br","i","be","just","glad","i","do","not","bui","the","dvd","for","thi","movi","king","of","the","zombi","be","on","the","other","side","and","it","a","masterpiec","of","film","make","compar","with","thi","movi","for","what","it","worth","i","will","give","it","a","i","wo","not","go","to","becaus","believ","it","or","not","i","have","see","wrong"],"filtered":["revolt","zombi","bad","noth","remot","entertain","movi","dull","lifeless","poorli","act","poorli","script","often","complain","origin","dracula","littl","slow","tast","good","thi","movi","make","dracula","look","like","roller","coaster","ride","minut","run","time","seem","like","minutesbr","br","stori","expedit","send","cambodia","find","secret","mind","control","zombif","man","find","secret","us","make","woman","love","marri","onc","thi","happen","releas","zombi","hi","control","horrif","consequ","whole","storybr","br","much","movi","try","figur","see","male","lead","look","familiar","plenti","time","think","thi","noth","happen","movi","befor","zombi","revolt","hit","dean","jagger","see","recent","gener","white","christma","thi","entertain","throughout","much","moviebr","br","glad","bui","dvd","thi","movi","king","zombi","side","masterpiec","film","make","compar","thi","movi","worth","give","wo","go","becaus","believ","see","wrong"],"filtered2":["revolt","zombi","bad","noth","remot","entertain","dull","lifeless","poorli","act","poorli","script","often","complain","origin","dracula","littl","slow","tast","good","make","dracula","look","like","roller","coaster","ride","minut","run","time","seem","like","minutesbr","stori","expedit","send","cambodia","find","secret","mind","control","zombif","man","find","secret","us","make","woman","love","marri","onc","happen","releas","zombi","control","horrif","consequ","whole","storybr","try","figur","see","male","lead","look","familiar","plenti","time","think","noth","happen","befor","zombi","revolt","hit","dean","jagger","see","recent","gener","white","christma","entertain","throughout","moviebr","glad","bui","dvd","king","zombi","side","masterpiec","make","compar","worth","give","wo","go","becaus","believ","see","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,8,9,12,14,16,17,21,22,25,30,35,36,38,45,49,54,56,59,69,70,77,79,91,94,111,137,157,195,219,225,236,238,247,268,327,347,359,367,388,390,398,400,406,415,425,438,465,482,541,562,649,721,733,748,798,823,872,883,887,1002,1095,1174,1227,1831,1847,1930,2093,2146,2307,2483,2810,3007,3939,4753,5607,6135,7964],"values":[3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,8,9,12,14,16,17,21,22,25,30,35,36,38,45,49,54,56,59,69,70,77,79,91,94,111,137,157,195,219,225,236,238,247,268,327,347,359,367,388,390,398,400,406,415,425,438,465,482,541,562,649,721,733,748,798,823,872,883,887,1002,1095,1174,1227,1831,1847,1930,2093,2146,2307,2483,2810,3007,3939,4753,5607,6135,7964],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.2920765891153156,1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,3.038623282696244,1.8162961064622165,3.3840606616174704,1.8113893252729412,1.8610609350701788,1.8693254449200722,2.127032521151058,2.094675786251684,1.9463902258768238,1.9469506069506084,

{"value":"High heels are tricksy things. They can elevate women (or cross-dressing men) to newfound heights, put forward a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. Alternatively, they can be a perilous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips, falls and ultimate tragedy. Tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish high riser.<br /><br />Almodóvar's mother-daughter drama is stylish for sure, but in terms of plot it's a tongue-tied and tedious affair full of confusing, complex characters that never fully engage or make sense. A few moments of comedy aside, Tacones lejanos just isn't interesting. The best bit comes at the beginning in a marvellously macabre case of manslaughter orchestrated by a child. From this brilliant bit of black comedy things are looking up, but then the film comes to a heel.<br /><br />There's solid enough acting performances and there's some stylish, arty direction that you'd expect from Almodóvar, but otherwise Tacones lejanos isn't an impressive piece of Spanish cinema. With a story of murder, showbiz, femininity, fractured mother-daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse. Instead it's poor.

{"value":"Mike Brady (Michael Garfield who had a minuscule part in the classic \"The Warriors\") is the first person in the community to realize that there's murderous slugs in his small town. Not just any slugs, mind you, but carnivorous killer bigger then normal, mutated by toxic waste slugs (who still only go as fast as a normal slug, which isn't that frightening, but I digress). No one will believe him at first, but they will. Oh yes, they will.<br /><br />OK, killer slugs are right above psychotic sloths and right below Johnathon Winters as Mork's baby in the creepiness factor. So the absurdness of it all is quite apparent from the get go. The flick is fun somewhat through and is of the 'so bad that it's good' variety. I appreciate that they spelled out that this was Slugs: the Movie as opposed to Slugs: the Children's Game or Slugs: the Other White Meat. Probably not worthy of watching it more than once and promptly forgetting it except for playing a rather obscure trivia game. Director Juan Piquer Simón is more widely known for his previous films \"Pod People\" (which MST3K deservedly mocked) and \"Peices\" (which is quite possibly the funnest bad movie ever made) <br /><br

{"value":"This is one of the most hilariously bad movies I have ever had the privilege to see.<br /><br />I watched this on DVD with a bunch of friends one Friday night and we just couldn't stop laughing from start to finish.<br /><br />The story is simple enough: terrorists hijack a convoy they think is carrying weapons grade uranium, but it's actually carrying a bunch of man-eating dinosaurs. Easy mistake to make. Cue a startlingly incompetent team of Army Special Forces to tackle the prehistoric beasts. They are led by Colonel Rance, played by Scott Valentine; a man who seems to have perfected 'Smell the fart' acting, as advocated by Joey in Friends.<br /><br />There's plenty of gore and an awful lot of shooting, but unfortunately Rance's team seem to have a problem aiming their weapons in the general direction of a horde of giant, lumbering monsters. Also, the lights always seem to flicker and go out whenever a Velociraptor attacks (preumably so we can't see how bad the creature effects are).<br /><br />Having said all that, we all had a great deal of fun betting on who was going to get their head bitten off next.<br /><br />As a Jusassic Park / Aliens style action adventure this movie stinks worse than a dinosaur's crotch, but as ludicrous, tongue-in-cheek entertainment it's a roaring

{"value":"I'll try to use words to describe this on.... <br /><br />I saw the original, which was good in its own way, but back then I should have feared a sequel.<br /><br />And I was 'afraid' when I picked this one up, but now that I've seen it, I have to say, it's even worse then I thought. Why these movies still get money still makes my mind spin. <br /><br />Let's start with the actors;they aren't all that good, but it has to be said, some make heads turn by being just plain awful. But what can an actor do with a script like this one. It's trying to be a copy of the original only this time the places have changed, any form of story is gone and any attempt of actually coming up with something that hasn't been done before, fails miserably. In a futile attempt to get it up-to-date, they try to make it exciting by making use of the whole 'big-brother' theme , but that has been worn out ages ago and offers nothing but a filler for between the beginning and the end. An attempt was made to try to save the movie by making a ton of references to the '83 original, but it just ended up being plain funny and sometimes a bit sad.

{"value":"Shintarô Katsu gained tons of fame playing the wonderful character, Zatoichi. The Zatoichi films had a weird and unbelievable concept--a blind guy is the greatest swordsman in Japan and spends each movie righting wrongs and exacting retribution on evil doers. He's a heck of a nice guy and the films are exciting and addictive (I've actually seen every movie). It is because of this I saw this final installment of the Hanzo the Razor series, as I assumed it would be very similar....and boy was I wrong! It turns out that the Hanzo films are extremely sexual in nature and they also promote the rape of \"women who deserve it\". You see, Hanzo is a policeman from the Meiji period and he regularly takes evil women into custody and interrogates them by violently raping them with his \"penis of steel\". How he made his member so strong is something you have to see to believe, but it certainly is NOT for the squeamish.<br /><br />Overall, I just can't recommend anyone sees these violent and misogynistic films. However, from looking at the other reviews, I can see that they are still very popular...and that is pretty scary. Despite some decent acting and amazing fight scenes, the films just are like brain pollution--and I'd hate to imagine how the films might have contributed to violence towards women.","finished_norm":["shintarô","katsu","gain","ton","of","fame","plai","the","wonder","charact","zatoichi","the","zatoichi","film","have","a","weird","and","unbeliev","concepta","blind","gui","be","the","great","swordsman","in","japan","and","spend","each","movi","right","wrong","and","exact","retribut","on","evil","doer","he","a","heck","of","a","nice","gui","and","the","film","be","excit","and","addict","i","have","actual","see","everi","movi","it","be","becaus","of","thi","i","see","thi","final","instal","of","the","hanzo","the","razor","seri","a","i","assum","it","would","be","veri","similarand","boi","be","i","wrong","it","turn","out","that","the","hanzo","film","be","extrem","sexual","in","natur","and","thei","conjur","promot","the","rape","of","woman","who","deserv","it","you","see","hanzo","be","a","policeman","from","the","meiji","period","and","he","regularli","take","evil","woman","into","custodi","and","interrog","them","by","violent","rape","them","with","hi","peni","of","steel","how","he","make","hi","member","so","strong","be","someth","you","have","to","see","to","believ","but","it","certainli","be","not","for","the","squeamishbr","br","overal","i","just","ca","not","recommend","anyon","see","thi","violent","and","misogynist","film","howev","from","look","at","the","other","review","i","can","see","that","thei","be","still","veri","popularand","that","be","pretti","scari","despit","some","decent","act","and","amaz","fight","scene","the","film","just","be","like","brain","pollutionand","i","have","hate","to","imagin","how","the","film","mai","have","contribut","to","violenc","toward","woman"],"filtered":["shintarô","katsu","gain","ton","fame","plai","wonder","charact","zatoichi","zatoichi","film","weird","unbeliev","concepta","blind","gui","great","swordsman","japan","spend","movi","right","wrong","exact","retribut","evil","doer","heck","nice","gui","film","excit","addict","actual","see","everi","movi","becaus","thi","see","thi","final","instal","hanzo","razor","seri","assum","veri","similarand","boi","wrong","turn","hanzo","film","extrem","sexual","natur","thei","conjur","promot","rape","woman","deserv","see","hanzo","policeman","meiji","period","regularli","take","evil","woman","custodi","interrog","violent","rape","hi","peni","steel","make","hi","member","strong","someth","see","believ","certainli","squeamishbr","br","overal","ca","recommend","anyon","see","thi","violent","misogynist","film","howev","look","review","see","thei","still","veri","popularand","pretti","scari","despit","decent","act","amaz","fight","scene","film","like","brain","pollutionand","hate","imagin","film","mai","contribut","violenc","toward","woman"],"filtered2":["shintarô","katsu","gain","ton","fame","plai","wonder","charact","zatoichi","zatoichi","weird","unbeliev","concepta","blind","gui","great","swordsman","japan","spend","right","wrong","exact","retribut","evil","doer","heck","nice","gui","excit","addict","actual","see","everi","becaus","see","final","instal","hanzo","razor","assum","veri","similarand","boi","wrong","turn","hanzo","extrem","sexual","natur","conjur","promot","rape","woman","deserv","see","hanzo","policeman","meiji","period","regularli","take","evil","woman","custodi","interrog","violent","rape","peni","steel","make","member","strong","someth","see","believ","certainli","squeamishbr","overal","ca","recommend","anyon","see","violent","misogynist","howev","look","review","see","still","veri","popularand","pretti","scari","despit","decent","act","amaz","fight","scene","like","brain","pollutionand","hate","imagin","mai","contribut","violenc","toward","woman"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,10,15,16,19,21,22,25,31,39,40,46,51,52,53,55,64,70,78,81,85,91,96,113,121,156,158,175,176,232,262,282,283,298,309,321,329,339,340,389,391,396,412,423,452,456,519,524,563,571,618,625,631,673,685,743,746,920,966,1477,1493,1545,1723,1749,1841,1895,1958,1973,2164,2210,3353,3424,4591,5057,5192,5324,6336,7074,8604],"values":[1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,10,15,16,19,21,22,25,31,39,40,46,51,52,53,55,64,70,78,81,85,91,96,113,121,156,158,175,176,232,262,282,283,298,309,321,329,339,340,389,391,396,412,423,452,456,519,524,563,571,618,625,631,673,685,743,746,920,966,1477,1493,1545,1723,1749,1841,1895,1958,1973,2164,2210,3353,3424,4591,5057,5192,5324,6336,7074,8604],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,3.934201232816368,1.1238870241028365,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.559277576165403,1.4070669811451506,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074

{"value":"I want to state first that I am a Christian (and that I do work in the film and TV industry) so I understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard. I'm all for positive, uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life (that this is a fallen world and that things don't always work out ... even for followers of Christ). I'm glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt Christian message; for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face. A movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes, exposition aplenty, and spontaneous changes in character behavior that are inexplicably to say the least. I believe that a film does not have to club you over the head with its message to get the point across. I'm sure the Kendrick bros. will improve with time and that their storytelling methods will as well. Maybe they could direct someone else's screenplay as their next project.<br /><br />* Sports films are not exactly my first love but a good one (Hoosiers, Field of Dreams, etc) can inspire in a multitude of ways. If you would be interested in a PG-rated film that inspires, give Steven Soderbergh's 'King of the Hill' a look.

{"value":"Medellin is a fabulous place to live, work, and study. I've been there twice, and never did I hear anything about guerrilla activities, paramilitaries taking tourists hostage, or anything of the sort. There are \"invisible police,\" but it is *not* a Big Brother system. There are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life, but they do not hassle someone without good reasons.<br /><br />La Sierra is an interesting documentary in that the youths it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters. The directors of the movie carefully carve out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra, and when a \"character\" dies, there is genuine pathos. It is difficult to imagine, however, that the three youths are all members of the Bloque Metro, a gang that used to terrorize La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country.<br /><br />La Sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in Colombia; there are, of course, things to be wary of such as petty crime, but when one considers pickpocketing happens in \"modern\" cities such as London, New York, or Tokyo, Colombia doesn't seem that different after all. Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once war-torn country is now prospering more than

{"value":"For Daniel Auteuil, `Queen Margot' was much better. For Nastassja Kinski, `Paris, Texas' was much better. The biggest disappointments were from Chris Menges (`CrissCross' and `A World Apart' cannot even be compared with this one), and Goran Bregovic for use of a version of the same musical theme from `Queen Margot' for this movie (Attention to the end of the film). If this was an American pop movie, I would not feel surprised at all; but for a European film with more independent actors and director, a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simple-minded and disappointing. There are those bad guys who kidnap and sell the underage people. There are those poor children who hate people selling them and wait to be saved by someone. And finally, there is that big hero who kills all the bad guys and saves these poor children from bad guys. Every character is shown in simple black and white terms: the good versus the evil. Plus, from the very beginning, I could understand how the story would end. Is this the end of the history of child sexual abuse? I believe that the difficult issue of child molestation and paedophilia is much more complex than how it is portrayed in this not very original movie.

{"value":"Yes, the first \"Howling\" was a classic. A rather good werewolf movie that I admit started slowly, but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera. Yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure...well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film. Oh sure, they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did, but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to Transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something. I often wonder what in the world Christopher Lee was doing in this movie, however I read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before, but still read the script before you take a role. Maybe you could have gotten into \"An American Werewolf in London\" hell that could have been possible. It was set in London after all. Heck, werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. In fact, the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude's ear's started

{"value":"Those familiar with the two previous Cube films pretty much know what they can expect: a small group of people trapped inside a bunch of booby trapped rooms, paranoia, bad acting... This one is a bit different though. Roughly half of the film takes place outside the cube, where we get to watch the people watching the people inside the cube (or at least five of them).<br /><br />I guess Cube Zero aspires to explain what the deal with the cube is, but you really don't get to know much more than what was covered in the two first films. Sure, there's sort of an explanation in there, but it feels pretty lame compared to what was suggested in the first film.<br /><br />Cube Zero looks rather cheap (as did its predecessors), and the fact that it shows more than just a couple of empty rooms only emphasizes this feeling. I also fell pretty confident in saying that there's no risk that any of the actors will win any awards in the foreseeable future. They have brought back the traps from Cube 1, though, (by that I mean that they're almost the same ones, which is a bit of a shame).<br /><br />I know that many people kind of appreciate this film and its ties with the first one, but I just feel that it's a completely unnecessary contribution to a franchise that wasn't that great to begin with.

{"value":"This movie is just plain dumb.<br /><br />From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the fatuous climax, the film is an exercise in wooden predictability.<br /><br />Mike Hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth. This film turns Hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too dumb to get away with anything. One is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack.<br /><br />Other parts of the movie are right out of the Three Stooges play book. Velda's dance at the barre, for instance, or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. And the continuity breaks are shameful: Frau Blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. The worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The bad guy stalking Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy.<br /><br />To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and

{"value":"This show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. It is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera. It's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style.<br /><br />It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer- Beat The Clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome. Then it rewards the winner money. If they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters, even better. While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality. <br /><br />This show has elements of several types of successful past programs. Reality television, hardly, but if your hooked on the contestants, locale or contest, this is your cup of tea. If your not, this entire series is as I say, drivel dripping with gravy. It is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000.<br /><br />It is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet. After all, so do re-runs of Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies & The Brady Bunch. This just doesn't employ professional actors.

{"value":"There is no way to describe how really, really, really bad this movie is. It's a shame that I actually sat through this movie, this very tiresome and predictable movie. What's wrong with it? Acting: There is not one performance that is even remotely close to even being sub-par (atleast they are all very pretty). Soundtrack (songs): \"If we get Orgy on the soundtrack then everyone will know that they are watching a horror film!\"; Soundtrack (score): Okay, but anyone with a keyboard can make an okay soundtrack these days. Don't even get me started on the \"What the hell?\" moments, here are a few: Killer can move at the speed of light--door opens actress turns, no one is there, turns back, there is something sitting in front of her.; Out of now where The killer shows up with a power drill, a really big one! The filmmakers get points for at least plugging it in, but can I really believe that the killer took the time to find the power outlet to plug it in. I feel like one of the guards at the beginning of Holy Grail and want to say \"Where'd you get the power drill?\". I could go on and on about how bad this film is but I only have 1000 words.

{"value":"This show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. It is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera. It's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style.<br /><br />It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer- Beat The Clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome. Then it rewards the winner money. If they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters, even better. While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality. <br /><br />This show has elements of several types of successful past programs. Reality television, hardly, but if your hooked on the contestants, locale or contest, this is your cup of tea. If your not, this entire series is as I say, drivel dripping with gravy. It is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000.<br /><br />It is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet. After all, so do re-runs of Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies & The Brady Bunch. This just doesn't employ professional actors.

{"value":"This show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel. It is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera. It's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style.<br /><br />It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer- Beat The Clock- by inventing situations for its contestants to try & overcome. Then it rewards the winner money. If they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters, even better. While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock- the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality. <br /><br />This show has elements of several types of successful past programs. Reality television, hardly, but if your hooked on the contestants, locale or contest, this is your cup of tea. If your not, this entire series is as I say, drivel dripping with gravy. It is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000.<br /><br />It is slick & well produced, so it might last a while yet. After all, so do re-runs of Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, The Beverly Hillbillies & The Brady Bunch. This just doesn't employ professional actors.

{"value":"When i looked at this years Wrestlemania's match card, i was SO stoked and unable to control myself because i was full of excitement.<br /><br />It starts...and it ends.<br /><br />I'm sitting there, angry to hell because of how much i wanted my money back. I mean, you watch Wrestlemania 22 (one of my favorites) which will go down as a classic and then you expect the same and get the average garbage they have every now and then. The one moment in the entire show that ruined it for me was when HBK tapped out!!!! That very moment of HBK losing to JOHN CENA!!!!!!!!!! John Cena is such a loser/poser. It almost ruined Wrestlemania 22 for me when he beat TRIPLE H! I couldn't watch WWE after seeing Wrestlemania 23. I'm starting to watch it again (luckily). I again have faith in WWE after Wrestlemania 24 (the greatest i have ever seen) which was a pure classic Wrestlemania. It definitely made up for 'Mania 23 and gave us lots of memorable moments as well.<br /><br />If you have watched ANY of the Wrestlemanias before this one, like the ones that turn you into fans (Wrestlemania 20 turned me into a fan), PLEASE don't watch this and make the same mistake i made and leave WWE behind. And if you DO watch it and are angry, start watching it again and watch Wrestlemania 24, it is absolutely classic.","finished_norm":["when","i","look","at","thi","year","wrestlemania","match","card","i","be","so","stoke","and","unabl","to","control","myself","becaus","i","be","full","of","excitementbr","br","it","startsand","it","endsbr","br","i","be","sit","there","angri","to","hell","becaus","of","how","much","i","want","my","monei","back","i","mean","you","watch","wrestlemania","on","of","my","favorit","which","will","go","down","a","a","classic","and","then","you","expect","the","same","and","get","the","averag","garbag","thei","have","everi","now","and","then","the","on","moment","in","the","entir","show","that","ruin","it","for","me","be","when","hbk","tap","out","that","veri","moment","of","hbk","lose","to","john","cena","john","cena","be","such","a","loserpos","it","almost","ruin","wrestlemania","for","me","when","he","beat","tripl","h","i","can","not","watch","wwe","after","see","wrestlemania","i","be","start","to","watch","it","again","luckili","i","again","have","faith","in","wwe","after","wrestlemania","the","great","i","have","ever","see","which","be","a","pure","classic","wrestlemania","it","definit","make","up","for","mania","and","give","u","lot","of","memor","moment","a","wellbr","br","if","you","have","watch","ani","of","the","wrestlemania","befor","thi","on","like","the","on","that","turn","you","into","fan","wrestlemania","turn","me","into","a","fan","pleas","do","not","watch","thi","and","make","the","same","mistak","i","make","and","leav","wwe","behind","and","if","you","do","watch","it","and","be","angri","start","watch","it","again","and","watch","wrestlemania","it","be","absolut","classic"],"filtered":["look","thi","year","wrestlemania","match","card","stoke","unabl","control","becaus","full","excitementbr","br","startsand","endsbr","br","sit","angri","hell","becaus","much","want","monei","back","mean","watch","wrestlemania","favorit","go","classic","expect","get","averag","garbag","thei","everi","moment","entir","show","ruin","hbk","tap","veri","moment","hbk","lose","john","cena","john","cena","loserpos","almost","ruin","wrestlemania","beat","tripl","h","watch","wwe","see","wrestlemania","start","watch","luckili","faith","wwe","wrestlemania","great","ever","see","pure","classic","wrestlemania","definit","make","mania","give","u","lot","memor","moment","wellbr","br","watch","ani","wrestlemania","befor","thi","like","turn","fan","wrestlemania","turn","fan","pleas","watch","thi","make","mistak","make","leav","wwe","behind","watch","angri","start","watch","watch","wrestlemania","absolut","classic"],"filtered2":["look","year","wrestlemania","match","card","stoke","unabl","control","becaus","full","excitementbr","startsand","endsbr","sit","angri","hell","becaus","want","monei","back","mean","watch","wrestlemania","favorit","go","classic","expect","get","averag","garbag","everi","moment","entir","show","ruin","hbk","tap","veri","moment","hbk","lose","john","cena","john","cena","loserpos","almost","ruin","wrestlemania","beat","tripl","h","watch","wwe","see","wrestlemania","start","watch","luckili","faith","wwe","wrestlemania","great","ever","see","pure","classic","wrestlemania","definit","make","mania","give","u","lot","memor","moment","wellbr","watch","ani","wrestlemania","befor","like","turn","fan","wrestlemania","turn","fan","pleas","watch","make","mistak","make","leav","wwe","behind","watch","angri","start","watch","watch","wrestlemania","absolut","classic"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,15,16,22,27,28,30,37,44,51,57,63,71,72,74,79,85,88,96,112,126,130,131,140,188,198,221,222,244,291,332,336,346,392,393,394,593,643,678,702,710,725,822,823,919,1072,1074,1161,1500,1576,2536,2938,3091,3565,6442,7646],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,15,16,22,27,28,30,37,44,51,57,63,71,72,74,79,85,88,96,112,126,130,131,140,188,198,221,222,244,291,332,336,346,392,393,394,593,643,678,702,710,725,822,823,919,1072,1074,1161,1500,1576,2536,2938,3091,3565,6442,7646],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,7.687598176578345,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,2.5958480334723544,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.4876543214774305,1.604729392502474,1.7139899308309823,1.834162586674748,1.8729627573220065,3.8429853485101932,1.9209463754160525,1.9486336368009016,1.9469506069506084,2.011190219103739,2.0317223413467334,4.078141625743051,2.2466628996789315,2.2391270689902285,2.2642139034199635,2.2512118082053005,4.634339551994196,7.613643667028086,2.5439726117360975,2.6423424573643777,2.5771019354959765,2.634508058031767,6.033663275156474,8.91160338950968,2.9233055795674137,3.023389038124396,3.0670934723591254,3.120015873813468,3.096

{"value":"POPEYE AND BIG FOOT **; POPEYE'S ENGINE COMPANY **; GETTING POPEYE'S GOAT **1/2<br /><br />I used to lap these up as a kid but, catching an episode of the series comprising three cartoons back-to-back now i.e. several years later (they preceded the theatrical screening of the pirate yarn RAIDERS OF THE SEVEN SEAS [1953]), I can see how they don't hold up all that well! The character of Popeye isn't exactly sympathetic to begin with, Olive Oyl distinctly overbearing and Bluto's antics failed to elicit much interest either  in short, the scripts were alarmingly thin, fairly awful and generally unfunny to boot. They're strictly juvenile fare, yet I doubt today's kids would even have the patience to stick with them!; furthermore, the animation style is unattractive.<br /><br />Taking each short per se, I guess they improved from one to the other: after the initial shock, one adapted to its mediocre quality as it were, so that the third cartoon easily results in being the most enjoyable of the lot  Popeye is entrusted with a mascot army goat whose immense appetite causes him no end of mischief (hardly original, I know, but always an amusing ploy). One interesting element here was that the shorts were bookended with Popeye delivering moralistic bits of wisdom to the kids in the

{"value":"Alan Rudolph is a so-so director, without that special touch. As an example, there was one shot in The Secret Lives of Dentists in the dental office which could have expressed the entire relationship between the husband and wife. Rudolph squandered it. The camera is in the hallway looking through the doorways of the two dental offices, with Dana and Dave each alone in their respective rooms. You get the idea of their desolation and isolation, but not much more. The lighting, the colors, the body language, the facial expressions could all have been vastly improved upon. If I were directing, I would have spent all day, if necessary, to get that shot right. That's the beauty and power of film: it can express so much, whole lives, in a matter of seconds<br /><br />The shot with the toddler stepping in the puddle of puke could have been improved on. The child should have shown more fascination with the puddle, should have stomped and shuffled her feet, should have had her head bent down to look at the puddle with all her attention. <br /><br />Campbell didn't deliver. He plays a uncommunicative man, true, but instead of conveying his inner turmoil in voice, gesture, body movement, the film relies on voice-over narration and dialogue with his imaginary macho alter-ego, played by Denis

{"value":"The back cover of the DVD (missed this one when it came out) hails Hitler -the Rise Of Evil as \"A Triumph\" (The New York Post) and \"Mesmerizing\" (Newsweek).<br /><br />Well,never mind the Post but really, who ever wrote that word in Newsweek in the same context with this peace of, ahem, art should be sacked.<br /><br />I don't no where to start with. Why try to paint the picture of Hitler's evil with colors that did not exist? He was evil alright, but now his character is portrayed in way that is often historically inaccurate (compared to his love of animals, the gentle and subdued way he treated women) and so on.<br /><br />The actors are good, so you must feel sorry for them as they are imprisoned inside their one-dimensional characters. Some kind of curse here with Peter O' Toole: This is the second time in his honorable career when he has ended up playing an old and failed leader in a failed movie (or in this case TV-production, to be accurate). The first one was of course the legendary Galigula.<br /><br />The list of historically inaccurate scenes alone would fill the 1000 words allowed by IMDb, so I think I'll leave it here.<br /><br />This one is OK if it's on telly and you don't have anything else to do, but believe me - it's best left on the shelf in your local Virgin

{"value":"I saw this film recently in a film festival. It's the romance of an ex-alcoholic unemployed man who just came out of a big depression and a single middle-aged woman who works in an employment office (INEM). I found the story very simple and full of clichés, taking the 'social' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy. The lead actor did a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not believable as a working class woman, she looks, acts and talks very much like a 'high-standing' woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it in all her movies anyway. The whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor. The photography is ugly, not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times. The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereira's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit. Anyway, I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The film-maker was by the door. I wonder what a director feels like when he sees someone walking out of one of his films, specially one that is made to please everybody.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","film","recent","in","a","film","festiv","it","the","romanc","of","a","exalcohol","unemploi","man","who","just","come","out","of","a","big","depress","and","a","singl","middleag","woman","who","work","in","a","employ","offic","inem","i","find","the","stori","veri","simpl","and","full","of","cliché","take","the","social","theme","of","the","movi","and","turn","it","in","to","a","romanc","comedi","the","lead","actor","do","a","good","job","he","definit","look","like","a","alcohol","man","but","ana","belen","be","not","believ","a","a","work","class","woman","she","look","act","and","talk","veri","much","like","a","highstand","woman","what","i","mean","be","that","ana","belen","plai","herself","she","doe","it","in","all","her","movi","anywai","the","whole","miseenscen","of","the","film","be","veri","poor","the","photographi","be","ugli","not","us","good","at","all","the","panoram","aspect","ratio","the","dialogu","sound","total","script","and","dull","much","of","the","time","the","comic","situat","be","typic","from","gomez","pereira","but","in","thi","case","thei","be","not","funni","at","all","and","be","resolv","poorli","in","my","opinion","thi","film","be","not","worth","watch","onli","if","you","realli","love","pereira","previou","film","you","mai","enjoi","thi","on","a","littl","bite","anywai","i","walk","out","of","the","theater","becaus","i","feel","i","be","wast","my","time","the","filmmak","be","by","the","door","i","wonder","what","a","director","feel","like","when","he","see","someon","walk","out","of","on","of","hi","film","special","on","that","be","make","to","pleas","everybodi"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","recent","film","festiv","romanc","exalcohol","unemploi","man","come","big","depress","singl","middleag","woman","work","employ","offic","inem","find","stori","veri","simpl","full","cliché","take","social","theme","movi","turn","romanc","comedi","lead","actor","good","job","definit","look","like","alcohol","man","ana","belen","believ","work","class","woman","look","act","talk","veri","much","like","highstand","woman","mean","ana","belen","plai","doe","movi","anywai","whole","miseenscen","film","veri","poor","photographi","ugli","us","good","panoram","aspect","ratio","dialogu","sound","total","script","dull","much","time","comic","situat","typic","gomez","pereira","thi","case","thei","funni","resolv","poorli","opinion","thi","film","worth","watch","onli","realli","love","pereira","previou","film","mai","enjoi","thi","littl","bite","anywai","walk","theater","becaus","feel","wast","time","filmmak","door","wonder","director","feel","like","see","someon","walk","hi","film","special","make","pleas","everybodi"],"filtered2":["see","recent","festiv","romanc","exalcohol","unemploi","man","come","big","depress","singl","middleag","woman","work","employ","offic","inem","find","stori","veri","simpl","full","cliché","take","social","theme","turn","romanc","comedi","lead","actor","good","job","definit","look","like","alcohol","man","ana","belen","believ","work","class","woman","look","act","talk","veri","like","highstand","woman","mean","ana","belen","plai","doe","anywai","whole","miseenscen","veri","poor","photographi","ugli","us","good","panoram","aspect","ratio","dialogu","sound","total","script","dull","time","comic","situat","typic","gomez","pereira","case","funni","resolv","poorli","opinion","worth","watch","onli","realli","love","pereira","previou","mai","enjoi","littl","bite","anywai","walk","theater","becaus","feel","wast","time","filmmak","door","wonder","director","feel","like","see","someon","walk","special","make","pleas","everybodi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,11,13,14,15,16,17,18,21,22,31,34,38,40,41,43,45,46,48,54,56,58,62,70,77,82,88,89,91,96,111,127,139,146,154,157,175,178,184,186,200,203,219,248,288,289,294,323,336,346,367,386,392,398,424,443,473,480,523,533,538,562,587,613,628,645,737,784,838,892,895,975,1075,1215,1217,1371,1905,2830,3667,4554,5867,6742],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,11,13,14,15,16,17,18,21,22,31,34,38,40,41,43,45,46,48,54,56,58,62,70,77,82,88,89,91,96,111,127,139,146,154,157,175,178,184,186,200,203,219,248,288,289,294,323,336,346,367,386,392,398,424,443,473,480,523,533,538,562,587,613,628,645,737,784,838,892,895,975,1075,1215,1217,1371,1905,2830,3667,4554,5867,6742],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9381148836729736,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,3.6001823395697077,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048

{"value":"I must say that during my childhood I'm quite proud of a lot of the movies I've rented. The exception being Theodore Rex. Talk about the all time swindler movie in any actor's resume. Could you just imagine what Whoopie's fired agent must have told her to sign on to this piece of crap \"Hey Whoop, you ever seen that show Dinosaurs, yeah well they're making a movie out of it, and you get to see Germany!\" After that that agent must have referenced Star Wars a lot.<br /><br />This movie was so bad I figured Whoopie must have bought out every copy of this film and had it destroyed. I just wish she could have done the same thing to my memory, because my sister still gives me crap for watching that movie. I mean c'mon, I'll even admit I watched Mr. Nanny and Kazzam in theaters (good reasons why I gave up on both Hulk Hogan and Shaq for awhile), yet this one sticks out in my mind as the worst of my childhood, and the biggest rental regret of my life, and that was 16 years ago. I'm 24 now if you want to do the math.<br /><br />Whenever I think of my all-time list of worst movies I don't even mention this one, because like a raped step-child, I try hard to repress that it ever happened.

{"value":"Unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making lame social commentary on a real event, but doesnt have the balls to legitimately document what happened. The constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame (I get the impression Ben Coccio is an avid gamer), or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message (we even get a laughable scene of the two boys burning ALL their cd's, talk about subtlety!), but the movie only gets away with it because its 'fiction'. Nice try. Yes its a great idea to relieve media of influence, but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting werent influenced by media? or video games? We dont, and we wont with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely relinquish the media, yet dumb enough to scorch a nazi symbol on the ground? haha I somehow dont think so.<br /><br />The movie bats you over the head with its portrayal of the normalcy of the families, its almost doing a disservice to think that there wasn't a serious flaw in the family dynamic of kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow schoolmates.

{"value":"No cinematic achievements here, however that's not even the important question. How does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie--and star vehicle?<br /><br />The formula requires the cute female lead a la Ryan or Aniston--check; there's a built-in TV audience!<br /><br />Add thick-headed, compliant men, usually including the problem ex-boyfriend/fiancée--check. <br /><br />Assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars. So far, so good.<br /><br />What is the male lead to consist of? He has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience (and the gay flight stewards) instantly swoon. But...he cannot be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience, and he can't outshine the star.

{"value":"It Could Have Been A Marvelous Story Based On The Ancient Races Of Cat People, but it wasn't.<br /><br />This work could have been just that; marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled. The lead characters (Charles Brady played by Brian Krause; and his mother Mary, played by Alice Krige) were shallowly done, had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing. Not even Mädchen Amick (who played Tanya Robertson)'s character fit into that description. <br /><br />However, as I've said many times before, when you adapt a Stephen King novel for TV, you simply must take into account the fact that his books aren't written for TV, and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist. <br /><br />This is another botched attempt to take the magick of Stephen King writing, whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay. To simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen. His novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie; nothing less but certainly nothing more. His screenplays are hit and miss.

{"value":"Let me start out by saying i will try not to put too many spoilers in this. Normally I enjoy Robin Williams movies, however this gem was not one of them. It was billed as a suspenseful thriller. The night listener was anything but. To be blunt there were 6 people in the theater opening day, 2 walked out, for good reason. The movie was in my opinion poorly written and directed. The acting was alright but again there wasn't anything to work with. The movie is about A storyteller who reads a good book by a dying kid. However *insert spooky here* no one can verify the kids existence. So Williams goes to Wisconsin to try and find the author, however all he gets is a headache and excuses from the boys caretaker. There thats it, thats all. You wait for about an hour and a half and movie ends. It had as many thrills and chills as a dentist office visit. The homosexual undertones, or overtones had really nothing to do with the story, and the movie had a little profanity but it seemed to be thrown in there for absolutely no reason and made little sense. In conclusion i really can't write a decent review on this film because there was nothing to it, it was as captivating as watching paint dry. I gave it a 2 because the acting for what it was worth was alright and it wasn't directed by Uwe Boll.","finished_norm":["let","me","start","out","by","sai","i","will","try","not","to","put","too","mani","spoiler","in","thi","normal","i","enjoi","robin","william","movi","howev","thi","gem","be","not","on","of","them","it","be","bill","a","a","suspens","thriller","the","night","listen","be","anyth","but","to","be","blunt","there","be","peopl","in","the","theater","open","dai","walk","out","for","good","reason","the","movi","be","in","my","opinion","poorli","write","and","direct","the","act","be","alright","but","again","there","be","not","anyth","to","work","with","the","movi","be","about","a","storytel","who","read","a","good","book","by","a","dye","kid","howev","insert","spooki","here","no","on","can","verifi","the","kid","exist","so","william","go","to","wisconsin","to","try","and","find","the","author","howev","all","he","get","be","a","headach","and","excus","from","the","boi","caretak","there","that","it","that","all","you","wait","for","about","a","hour","and","a","half","and","movi","end","it","have","a","mani","thrill","and","chill","a","a","dentist","offic","visit","the","homosexu","underton","or","overton","have","realli","noth","to","do","with","the","stori","and","the","movi","have","a","littl","profan","but","it","seem","to","be","throw","in","there","for","absolut","no","reason","and","make","littl","sens","in","conclus","i","realli","ca","not","write","a","decent","review","on","thi","film","becaus","there","be","noth","to","it","it","be","a","captiv","a","watch","paint","spindri","i","give","it","a","becaus","the","act","for","what","it","be","worth","be","alright","and","it","be","not","direct","by","uw","boll"],"filtered":["let","start","sai","try","put","mani","spoiler","thi","normal","enjoi","robin","william","movi","howev","thi","gem","bill","suspens","thriller","night","listen","anyth","blunt","peopl","theater","open","dai","walk","good","reason","movi","opinion","poorli","write","direct","act","alright","anyth","work","movi","storytel","read","good","book","dye","kid","howev","insert","spooki","verifi","kid","exist","william","go","wisconsin","try","find","author","howev","get","headach","excus","boi","caretak","wait","hour","half","movi","end","mani","thrill","chill","dentist","offic","visit","homosexu","underton","overton","realli","noth","stori","movi","littl","profan","seem","throw","absolut","reason","make","littl","sens","conclus","realli","ca","write","decent","review","thi","film","becaus","noth","captiv","watch","paint","spindri","give","becaus","act","worth","alright","direct","uw","boll"],"filtered2":["let","start","try","put","mani","spoiler","normal","enjoi","robin","william","howev","gem","bill","suspens","thriller","night","listen","anyth","blunt","peopl","theater","open","dai","walk","good","reason","opinion","poorli","write","direct","act","alright","anyth","work","storytel","read","good","book","dye","kid","howev","insert","spooki","verifi","kid","exist","william","go","wisconsin","try","find","author","howev","get","headach","excus","boi","caretak","wait","hour","half","end","mani","thrill","chill","dentist","offic","visit","homosexu","underton","overton","realli","noth","stori","littl","profan","seem","throw","absolut","reason","make","littl","sens","conclus","realli","ca","write","decent","review","becaus","noth","captiv","watch","paint","spindri","give","becaus","act","worth","alright","direct","uw","boll"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,6,7,13,14,17,21,22,23,24,30,35,36,38,48,49,50,65,71,81,95,102,104,113,114,124,132,145,151,159,173,174,176,200,206,210,219,222,242,282,294,309,310,331,398,424,490,528,529,538,587,617,700,714,719,722,845,868,957,1112,1167,1218,1230,1447,1505,1551,1627,1937,2028,2030,2241,2418,2479,2684,3123,3283,3315,3641,4679,5158,6626,6842,8268],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,6,7,13,14,17,21,22,23,24,30,35,36,38,48,49,50,65,71,81,95,102,104,113,114,124,132,145,151,159,173,174,176,200,206,210,219,222,242,282,294,309,310,331,398,424,490,528,529,538,587,617,700,714,719,722,845,868,957,1112,1167,1218,1230,1447,1505,1551,1627,1937,2028,2030,2241,2418,2479,2684,3123,3283,3315,3641,4679,5158,6626,6842,8268],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,2.2635883139467947,2.2350163994518417,1.2770536940105968,2.324031090670098,2.5958480334723544,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,2.9360366939211433,1.519311641348122,1.6955116224012472,3.3840606616174704,3.43598877114071,3.8147700134888347,1.9214926742550966,1.949757232424728,4.064665311355097,4.175107420354542,4.145648

{"value":"Rosario Dawson stars as a girl who is date raped and then begins a decent into darkness until given a chance at revenge. While its clear why Dawson took the role, its a chance to show her acting chops and to make a small independent, decidedly un-Hollywood film, its also clear that aside from stunning good looks, Dawson seems out of place in the role. Forgive me I simply couldn't find her. Thats not a mistake, thats how I felt, I had no idea where she was. Yes I know she's on the screen but even though I spent the better part of two hours looking at her she left no impression on me whats so ever. I blame the script for this since other than the ending, not a whole heck of a lot that happened on screen seemed to make any real sense. The people seemed to be more posture than real and what happens didn't seem to fit together. Forgive me for being vague but nothing in this film, other than the end (which I would love to talk about but can't cause it would spoil it), and the image of Rosario Dawson as nothing more than an image, stayed with me.What can I say, this may click with you, it may not, for me it's time I can't get back.

{"value":"This is a truly awful \"B\" movie. It is witless and often embarrassing. The plot, the basic \"making into show business\" routine, is almost nonexistent. In fact, the film is merely an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups of 1942, including the Mills Brothers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby, and Freddy Slack. Each group gets about the standard three minutes, the exception being the Mills Brothers, who for some reason warranted two numbers. Ann Miller doesn't get to dance until the last couple of minutes of the film, and she has little to do but strut her stuff amid a barrage of patriotic propaganda.<br /><br />The most interesting moment in the film, in my view, occurred in the Duke Ellington segment. The band appears to be playing in a train, standing in awkward positions. (In the deep South at the time, the band was segregated in railroad cars when traveling.) Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke, and Harry Carney may also be identified. In the last moments of the film, trumpeter/violinist Ray Nance rushes down the aisle to the camera and does an \"uncle Tom,\" bugging his eyes and wiggling his head the way Willy Best did in many films. For modern viewers, especially jazz fans, this homage to segregation is sad indeed.

{"value":"I disliked this film intensely and left during the scene where the loyalist gang are shot up by the British. The film effectively blames the people of NI as being the cause of their own troubles. It suggests that the 25 year war was a question of intransigence and nothing to do with Britain's partition of Ireland and domination of its history i.e. NI was created by Britain in 1921 irrespective of the wishes of the rest of Ireland.<br /><br />The characters are portrayed as hapless fools, even though I despise loyalist paramilitaries they were fighting for a cause - maintaining their artificial privileges over the Catholic community. It is a known fact that British Intelligence collaborated with loyalists during the war, no doubt to keep the Catholics at bay and demoralise republicanism.<br /><br />Nineties' values about 'machismo', masculinity etc are transposed on to 1970s Belfast and are portrayed as part of the supposedly unique Irish 'psyche' which leads to violence. The stupid song from the woman in the club - old Ireland of green fields ..blah..blah.. - is given a symbolic stature, i.e. poor young fools fighting for an impossible cause. Tedious, ahistorical, cheap and nasty trash. O'Sullivan has made a personal statement on a conflict which requires serious political
