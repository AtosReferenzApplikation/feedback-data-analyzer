{"value":"I hate to be the one to rain on a parade (even a small one like this) but from the very first scene, you could tell this film was going to be absolute shite. Its a shame really, as I quite like Martin Freeman and Danny dyer. I was intrigued as to how they would mix in a film together, but to my dismay, they did not even have a scene together!! I think I need to repeat this - The two lead actors (who stand side by side on the advertisement posters and DVD covers) did not have one scene together!!!! They did not speak to each other and never appeared on screen at the same time. Just about sums up this poor excuse for a movie. False advertisement.<br /><br />The dialogue was painful, every single character in the movie was unrealistic, and un-human like. The scenarios were far fetched, the plot was crap, the jokes were thin, Freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played a poor mans Tim from The office), nobody was likable, and worst of all, some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me to switch off, as I couldn't bear to watch, or listen to them any longer.<br /><br />This low budget stinker was an epic fail. Even Danny Dyer couldn't inject some humour and charm into this, but bless, he tried. What a waste of time.<br /><br />How anybody could rate this movie as 'ten stars' is beyond me. Ten Stars? Seriously? Come on....I won't even give some of the greats ten stars, as ten stars implies that a movie was perfect. This film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, meaning that it was almost completely dire throughout.<br /><br />Watch it if you like, but if you've seen a lot of movies, and watched a lot of great movies, your review will probably similar to mine.<br /><br

{"value":"I just blew four dollars renting this movie! Why Alliance Atlantis would promote such a poor excuse for a film is beyond me. But even more surprising was the reasonably good reviews that a couple of Canadian newspaper critics gave this film. I'm tired of our media justifying a film simply because it's Canadian and low budget. It's like they expect Canadian films to be lousy, so they give it a good review regardless.<br /><br />Now about the movie: The acting was below average (with the exception of the lead male character, who was actually pretty good). The film quality was poor, which I guess could be expected from the extremely low budget. The script was absolutely horrendous. An example is the story, which revolves around one of the lead characters, a female drug dealer who flirts with one of her clients so that she can recruit him to fix and steal bicycles for her gang, whose only purpose is to randomly destroy SUV's. Supposedly many of her gang members' bicycles are destroyed in these activities (I don't know how she can't afford to just buy new ones, since she is supposed to be this big drug dealing connection from Vancouver to Toronto).<br /><br />Anyway, the point of the story (which isn't revealed until well over halfway through the movie) is that the drug dealer plans to firebomb buildings in the Toronto area to attempt to make houses more affordable - as no one will want to live in the area.<br /><br />- Need I say more.<br /><br />Shame on the Toronto Film Festival for accepting such a film, Telefilm for supporting it, and the Globe and Mail and Georgia Straight newspapers for giving such biased reviews.<br /><br />A film shouldn't get special treatment just because it's

{"value":"My roommates & I nearly shorted out our TV from the numerous spit-takes we did while watching this hilarious piece of 1970s self important pseudo-zen dreck. I'd read about this campfest for ages and scanned my local late night TV listings for YEARS in search of this elusive turd. Several years ago our local ABC affiliate was known for showing cool flicks for its late night weekend flick (ie \"Frogs\", \"Night of the Lepus\", etc). Then one day it happened: at 1:40am on a Saturday night (over 5 years ago) there it was! We had over 15 folks over and the flick did NOT disappoint!<br /><br />See! Andy Griffith as the silliest & most unthreatening bad guy since Jaye Davidson in \"Stargate\"!<br /><br />See! William Shatner sport a variety of things atop his head that only faintly resemble human hair (or anything organic for that matter).<br /><br />Hear! jaw droppingly inane 1970s psychobabble that makes \"Chicken Soup For The Soul\" sound like BF Skinner<br /><br />Feel! Content that any decade was better than the 70s.<br /><br />For those still reading...the plot surrounds a bunch of middle class mid level a--holes who decide to suck up to their s---head boss (Griffith) by joining him on a cross dessert race that spans California & Mexico. They all wear leather jackets, looking more Christopher Street than anything else. Along the way they stop at a Cantina, get drunk, smoke joints (the sight Robert \"Mike Brady\" Reed smoke a joint is an image you won't soon forget), start a fight, attempt rape, and just act like a bunch of suburban middle class jack offs. Although I have an excellent copy that I taped off TV I WISH this one would be released on video so the whole world could enjoy its half baked

{"value":"Please do not let the cover of this movie fool you. And if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at: this isn't it. Usually I will go for stupid if it's funny, but this stupid was so stupid it almost (or possibly did) make me stupid.<br /><br />The film quality is better than a handheld, but not by much, and it's quite possible the music was created by pressing the Samba 2 key on a Casio keyboard. These problems should never really be a deterent from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing (weep) cast, and you have a real humdinger.<br /><br />The story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in Texas for the weekend. He also extends the invitation to his lady crush in his office. On the way there they meet a female in distress, who is then invited to come along by the other girls.<br /><br />The stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house.<br /><br />From there you (the audience) and the morons, um, actors, try to figure out what's going on and they soon begin to distrust one another. Overall I think I have made it sound better than it is. The main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot contrived, the acting bad and the motivations clueless. Once more this could be forgiveable it it was the least bit funny but alas, it is not.<br /><br />The twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway.

{"value":"Watching \"Speak Easily\" is painful for fans of Buster Keaton. Seeing such a phenomenal writer, actor, comic, director, and stunt man subjected to this humiliating spectacle is like seeing a Picasso used as a drop cloth, or perhaps more like seeing the finest Camembert adulterated with whey solids and processed into Cheez-Whiz. <br /><br />Keaton is ill-cast as Professor Post, whose overblown vocabulary is the only thing keeping him from saying, \"Tell me about the rabbits, George.\" (Post would have said something like, \"Kindly inform me as to the status of the small mammals in the family Leporidae of the order Lagomorpha, kind sir, who I believe is primarily addressed with the epithet 'George'.\") When Keaton created his own characters, they might be situationally clueless but they weren't stupid. They were quick studies and became masters of their worlds. Not so with Post, who never stops stumbling and bumbling and who who has no more control of his destiny than a bilge rat had of the Titanic. And while Keaton's original characters had a charming naiveté and innocence, Post comes across as such a profound sexual retardate that if he ever did become physically aroused, he'd put an ice bag on the swelling and seek medical help. <br /><br />There are a couple of small, redeeming moments, such as Keaton's attempts to get rid of the vampish Thema Todd or his suggestion as to appropriate attire for a Greek dance, but it's just not worth enduring the entire film to see them.<br /><br />If you're a fan of bad movies, get drunk and watch \"Speak Easily\" with friends, a la \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\".

{"value":"What a dog of a movie. Noni Hazelhurst's performance is quite good, but it sits amidst a jungle of abhorrent scriptwriting, mediocre direction and wooden acting from the bulk of the cast. Many of the characters are woefully miscast, particularly the ever overrated Colin Friels.<br /><br />Very little works in this pretentious garbage. Much of the \"character development\" is done through a silly, angst-ridden voice over and frequently completely contradicts the behaviour of characters on-screen. In fact, it's hard to even figure out who the voice overs are talking about because they describe such different characters to who we see on screen! How are we meant to know Colin Friels (Javo) is meant to be an erratic, violent and unreliable junkie? One of these silly voice overs tells us. For crying out loud, the nature of his character is half the point of the movie and the only thing that lets us know is a flippin' voice over! The real killer is the characters. Everything about them. Their clothes are perfectly maintained and look fresh from the rack, despite the fact we are constantly reminded they are meant to be artsy paupers. They are all absurdly well-spoken for \"junkies\". None seem to have any real comprehension of life on the skids or on smack and yet this is meant to be the case with most of them.<br /><br />Monkey Grip deserves no more attention than a weekday TV movie matinée. Crud like this, perfectly well shot and technically presented, but a cliché-driven angsty drama that shoots so wide of being plausible and meanders about for hours without really going anywhere.

{"value":"Sorry, not good.<br /><br />It starts out interesting, but looses its way a few minutes into the movie.<br /><br />It does not help a lot that none of the normally great actors (Quaid, Glover, Ermey, Leto etc.) delivers a really good performance. <br /><br />It might be owed to the fact that I saw a dubbed version (german), but Dennis Quaid's character was especially wooden and annoying, and Danny Glover does not really make for a believable villain. Moreover, Jared Leto's character does not really contribute to the story whatsoever (except saving one main character's life at one point, but that scene is as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine in the first place ;-)<br /><br />Speaking of unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is really the tangled and cliché-ridden storyline: The detective (of course!) has to settle a personal matter with the villain and is (of course!) suspended from his official duties courtesy of his personal entanglement. The killer (of course!) *wants* to be tracked down and plays a cat-and-mouse game with his opponent for years ... I don't know how many movies build on a similar plot - most of them better, however.<br /><br />The plot has got holes galore and many completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the storyline at all (e.g. the truck stop scene or the car at the cliff's edge etc.)<br /><br />To top it off, the ending tries to be original and exciting, but fails completely in these regards. We've seen *much* better finales with a similar kind of ultimate-battle-on-a-train-in-a-forlorn-winter-landscape setup ...

{"value":"Tobe Hooper has made great movies so I was certain this couldn't be BAD. I didn't read any reviews and tried to watch this unintentionally humorous film. At times this made me laugh, sometimes I almost fell asleep, sometimes made me almost CRY for Hooper.<br /><br />I rated this 3/10 because its 1990 \"horror\"-movie and many interesting or funny things happened there. Throughout the movie I was thinking something like \"they simply CAN'T add more things in this movie...\" .. but they did.<br /><br />Some tell this is some sort of Firestarter clone but truly isn't. It's based on that idea but thats all. This is combination of horror, comedy, weird religion/god things, funny gore, simple effects, drama, horrible acting, unbelievable script..and more.<br /><br />*spoilers* Story is: Government tries to create ultimate weapon using nuclear power or something and fails, during process child is born for 2 test persons. When mom sings to her child after the birth, both husband and wife burns and it is SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION. Government buries whole thing and leaves this child live amongst other people and ... then after x years this kid is grown up and realizes he has been born for a reason and whoa he can burn things with his brains.

{"value":"and it doesn't help rohmer's case that a few years later Syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject (with a little help from Wagner).<br /><br />maybe this movie didn't look so paltry when it came out, without the syberberg film to compare it to, which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources. I actually can't recall at the moment whether there are horses in the syberberg film. all I know is, the German version is pure magic, while this one looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposes.<br /><br />the music... la musique... isn't even credited here on IMDb... but someone based it on 'airs from the 12th-14th centuries\" or something... well it isn't a great help to the film. it comes off as inauthentic and cheesy, comme le frommage mon cher!!!<br /><br />rohmer is one of those french auteurs who likes his leading men generally quite unattractive, too, and that doesn't help matters. syberberg's Parsifal was adorable, and can be seen on German television today selling some kind of special bicycle he invented. .. .<br /><br />I shudder to think what watching the syberberg on video is like. I remember that the last time I saw the film in a theater, the print was so bad that the experience was a whopping 5 hour travesty. But even then it would have to surpass what this version has to offer, I'm afraid.<br /><br />points for earnestness, for chutzpah, but... this film simply needed beau-coup more bucks. it doesn't look like a medieval manuscript it looks CHEAPO! BON MARCHE!! oh and yeah, it just ends very arbitrarily with Parsifal going to church and this cheesy passion play being interjected...

{"value":"This movie was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together. Well there's nothing wrong with that, except it looks like it was made by a bunch of white guys that went to school together. 90 percent of the cast are white males about same age. It's almost like watching a bunch of guys at boys camp who turned the camera on themselves. The movie has no plot. It simply repeats the same action of blood bath after blood bath. There are some funny scenes and comedic bits. But they don't redeem the flat monotony.<br /><br />The graphic cartoon scenes are used to cover the stuff that was obviously beyond their budget or resources to do, and not done very well at that. Anything that can't be done with white guys running around on the beach covered in blood is done with cheap animation.<br /><br />I went to see this film after seeing the trailer, which makes it look like a Tarrentino piece. Well, the trailer scenes are as good as they ever get. Ther rest of it just repeats the same kind of mundane, inane comedy. It works at times, but it gets boring after the same stuff comes at you over and over. It's more like a string of Satuday Night Live skits than a movie. It's a hit-you-over-the-head-with-it kind of comedy. I can see where the story idea is intriguing. But, in this film post apocalyptic America is much like Medevil England. In fact Wheatlry says the story ideas came from that era. He plans to make a Part 2. I guess he thinks he's Tarrentino or maybe doing a parody thing.<br /><br />At the opening in LA, Wheatley mentioned he will bring back pretty much the same cast in part 2. He was asked if he might consider a more diverse cast in the next one, to which he replied, well yea,

{"value":"I just watched The Convent for the second time. I had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken Friday night film, some gore, some style, bit of humour and suchlike. I was saddened to find that I could no longer appreciate it much. It seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like Night of the Demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile. For the record I'm not even a huge fan of Night of the Demons, but there were some things I really dug about it. The Convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much. Apart from the main girl (likeable performance from Joanna Canton), the goth girl and a sweet cameo from Adrienne Barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable, festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic, offensive jockhood. The film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that, given the awful dialogue, it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film. The evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes, though not scary their certainly kinda cool, and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore. Towards the end, when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy. The stylised direction also occasionally yields good results, although sometimes the camera just moves too fast. All in all, this was a film where for me the shining good points just can't make up for the things I hated. Those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more, but for me it wasn't a good

{"value":"I remember watching this on prime time when I was about 7 years old. I was a huge comic book reader at the time, and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily. The end result, however, was underwhelming.<br /><br />I was aware of the \"Emma Peel\" Diana Prince stories, as they had only recently come to an end and Diana was returned to her Amazonian form. However, there was so little action that I was bored throughout most of the movie. The final costume was an interesting idea, but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero.<br /><br />I saw the movie again in my late teen years. It hadn't improved much. Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar, thanks to That's Incredible, but her acting was no better. The script had a few good ideas, like the rogue Amazon, and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban, but it just didn't come together and was still boring.<br /><br />I think they should have built the back story better, and built the show into a more epic climax. It was too much like a bland spy film, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book. The Amazon elements were intriguing, but needed to be expanded.<br /><br />The film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful, if a bit too camp and low budget. The budget was also pretty low here, and superheroes don't come cheap.<br /><br />It would be nice to have the movie available on DVD, if only as a comparison and historical document. Even Superman 4 is available, and it has nothing over this film (except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman). It's worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions.","finished_norm":["i","rememb","watch","thi","on","prime","time","when","i","be","about","year","old","i","be","a","huge","comic","book","reader","at","the","time","and","anyth","relat","to","superhero","be","anticip","heavili","the","end","result","howev","be","underwhelmingbr","br","i","be","awar","of","the","emma","peel","diana","princ","stori","a","thei","have","onli","recent","come","to","a","end","and","diana","be","return","to","her","amazonian","form","howev","there","be","so","littl","action","that","i","be","bore","throughout","much","of","the","movi","the","final","costum","be","a","interest","idea","but","look","much","like","a","cheerlead","than","a","superherobr","br","i","see","the","movi","again","in","my","late","teen","year","it","have","not","improv","much","cathi","lee","crosbi","be","much","familiar","thank","to","that","incred","but","her","act","be","no","well","the","script","have","a","few","good","idea","like","the","rogu","amazon","and","a","decent","villain","in","ricardo","montalban","but","it","just","do","not","come","togeth","and","be","still","boringbr","br","i","think","thei","should","have","build","the","back","stori","well","and","build","the","show","into","a","much","epic","climax","it","be","too","much","like","a","bland","spy","film","cross","with","a","superhero","stori","write","by","someon","who","have","never","see","a","comic","book","the","amazon","elem","be","intrigu","but","ne","to","be","expandedbr","br","the","film","do","succ","in","forc","produc","to","go","back","to","the","draw","board","and","come","up","with","someth","much","faith","if","a","bite","too","camp","and","low","budget","the","budget","be","conjur","pretti","low","here","and","superhero","do","not","come","cheapbr","br","it","would","be","nice","to","have","the","movi","avail","on","dvd","if","onli","a","a","comparison","and","histor","docum","even","superman","be","avail","and","it","have","noth","over","thi","film","except","chri","reev","and","gene","hackman","it","worth","see","for","curios","sake","and","for","a","bite","of","inspir","and","caution","for","futur","version"],"filtered":["rememb","watch","thi","prime","time","year","old","huge","comic","book","reader","time","anyth","relat","superhero","anticip","heavili","end","result","howev","underwhelmingbr","br","awar","emma","peel","diana","princ","stori","thei","onli","recent","come","end","diana","return","amazonian","form","howev","littl","action","bore","throughout","much","movi","final","costum","interest","idea","look","much","like","cheerlead","superherobr","br","see","movi","late","teen","year","improv","much","cathi","lee","crosbi","much","familiar","thank","incred","act","well","script","good","idea","like","rogu","amazon","decent","villain","ricardo","montalban","come","togeth","still","boringbr","br","think","thei","build","back","stori","well","build","show","much","epic","climax","much","like","bland","spy","film","cross","superhero","stori","write","someon","never","see","comic","book","amazon","elem","intrigu","ne","expandedbr","br","film","succ","forc","produc","go","back","draw","board","come","someth","much","faith","bite","camp","low","budget","budget","conjur","pretti","low","superhero","come","cheapbr","br","nice","movi","avail","dvd","onli","comparison","histor","docum","even","superman","avail","noth","thi","film","except","chri","reev","gene","hackman","worth","see","curios","sake","bite","inspir","caution","futur","version"],"filtered2":["rememb","watch","prime","time","year","old","huge","comic","book","reader","time","anyth","relat","superhero","anticip","heavili","end","result","howev","underwhelmingbr","awar","emma","peel","diana","princ","stori","onli","recent","come","end","diana","return","amazonian","form","howev","littl","action","bore","throughout","final","costum","interest","idea","look","like","cheerlead","superherobr","see","late","teen","year","improv","cathi","lee","crosbi","familiar","thank","incred","act","well","script","good","idea","like","rogu","amazon","decent","villain","ricardo","montalban","come","togeth","still","boringbr","think","build","back","stori","well","build","show","epic","climax","like","bland","spy","cross","superhero","stori","write","someon","never","see","comic","book","amazon","elem","intrigu","ne","expandedbr","succ","forc","produc","go","back","draw","board","come","someth","faith","bite","camp","low","budget","budget","conjur","pretti","low","superhero","come","cheapbr","nice","avail","dvd","onli","comparison","histor","docum","even","superman","avail","noth","except","chri","reev","gene","hackman","worth","see","curios","sake","bite","inspir","caution","futur","version"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,7,8,11,12,14,16,17,20,21,24,28,34,39,42,49,53,57,60,63,64,65,67,77,78,104,108,110,113,123,129,139,150,151,154,156,217,219,220,232,247,256,261,262,270,290,309,338,438,444,447,477,479,480,488,520,562,570,576,651,689,776,844,881,903

{"value":"Why, oh, why won't they learn? When you've got a nice, juicy exploitation gimmick, use it! Don't go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful; you're only gonna wind up looking foolish.<br /><br />Christmas Evil is the story of Harry Stadling, who saw a little bit too much of Mommy kissing (Daddy-dressed-as-)Santa Claus back when he was a kid. So, of course, Harry grows up obsessed with Christmas, and finally, when his disillusionment becomes too great, he flips out, dresses as Santa, and wanders the city giving out toys to good little children, and viciously killing anyone he deems naughty.<br /><br />Simple enough, and not a bad place to start. (After all, how many other holiday-themed horror flicks use the same schtick?) Unfortunately, this film wants to be more \"Santa, Portrait of a Serial Killer\" than \"Silent Night, Deadly Night\". Two-thirds of the film are spent documenting Harry's slow but inevitable breakdown, when I would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were rolling. You know a slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself urging the killer to just get on with it already.<br /><br />Perhaps Harry's descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director, but alas, we've got some guy named Lewis Jackson. Apparently, this is his only film, and it shows. The action jumps giddily from scene to scene, without establishing shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing.<br /><br />Even once the film gets rolling, we're still treated to heaping helpings of Harry's self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behavior. More depressing than frightening, Christmas Evil is one to avoid.","finished_norm":["why","oh","why","wo","not","thei","learn","when","you","have","get","a","nice","juici","exploit","gimmick","us","it","do","not","go","mess","around","try","to","get","all","deep","and","thought","you","re","onli","gonna","wind","up","look","foolishbr","br","christma","evil","be","the","stori","of","harri","stadl","who","see","a","littl","bite","too","much","of","mommi","kiss","daddydressedassanta","clau","back","when","he","be","a","kid","so","of","cours","harri","grow","up","obsess","with","christma","and","final","when","hi","disillusion","becom","too","great","he","flip","out","dress","a","santa","and","wander","the","citi","give","out","toi","to","good","littl","child","and","vicious","kill","anyon","he","deem","naughtybr","br","simpl","enough","and","not","a","bad","place","to","start","after","all","how","mani","other","holidaythem","horror","flick","us","the","same","schtick","unfortun","thi","film","want","to","be","much","santa","portrait","of","a","serial","killer","than","silent","night","deadli","night","twothird","of","the","film","be","spend","docum","harri","slow","but","inevit","breakdown","when","i","would","have","be","will","to","bui","the","premis","by","the","time","the","open","titl","be","roll","you","know","a","slasher","film","be","in","troubl","when","you","find","yourself","urg","the","killer","to","just","get","on","with","it","alreadybr","br","perhap","harri","descent","into","mad","can","have","be","compel","in","the","hand","of","a","compet","director","but","ala","we","have","get","some","gui","name","lewi","jackson","appar","thi","be","hi","onli","film","and","it","show","the","action","jump","giddili","from","scene","to","scene","without","establish","shot","or","clear","view","of","the","actor","to","let","u","know","where","we","be","and","who","we","be","seeingbr","br","even","onc","the","film","get","roll","we","re","still","treat","to","heap","help","of","harri","selfpiti","insecur","and","neurot","behavior","much","depress","than","frighten","christma","evil","be","on","to","avoid"],"filtered":["oh","wo","thei","learn","get","nice","juici","exploit","gimmick","us","go","mess","around","try","get","deep","thought","re","onli","gonna","wind","look","foolishbr","br","christma","evil","stori","harri","stadl","see","littl","bite","much","mommi","kiss","daddydressedassanta","clau","back","kid","cours","harri","grow","obsess","christma","final","hi","disillusion","becom","great","flip","dress","santa","wander","citi","give","toi","good","littl","child","vicious","kill","anyon","deem","naughtybr","br","simpl","enough","bad","place","start","mani","holidaythem","horror","flick","us","schtick","unfortun","thi","film","want","much","santa","portrait","serial","killer","silent","night","deadli","night","twothird","film","spend","docum","harri","slow","inevit","breakdown","bui","premis","time","open","titl","roll","know","slasher","film","troubl","find","urg","killer","get","alreadybr","br","perhap","harri","descent","mad","compel","hand","compet","director","ala","get","gui","name","lewi","jackson","appar","thi","hi","onli","film","show","action","jump","giddili","scene","scene","without","establish","shot","clear","view","actor","let","u","know","seeingbr","br","even","onc","film","get","roll","re","still","treat","heap","help","harri","selfpiti","insecur","neurot","behavior","much","depress","frighten","christma","evil","avoid"],"filtered2":["oh","wo","learn","get","nice","juici","exploit","gimmick","us","go","mess","around","try","get","deep","thought","re","onli","gonna","wind","look","foolishbr","christma","evil","stori","harri","stadl","see","littl","bite","mommi","kiss","daddydressedassanta","clau","back","kid","cours","harri","grow","obsess","christma","final","disillusion","becom","great","flip","dress","santa","wander","citi","give","toi","good","littl","child","vicious","kill","anyon","deem","naughtybr","simpl","enough","bad","place","start","mani","holidaythem","horror","flick","us","schtick","unfortun","want","santa","portrait","serial","killer","silent","night","deadli","night","twothird","spend","docum","harri","slow","inevit","breakdown","bui","premis","time","open","titl","roll","know","slasher","troubl","find","urg","killer","get","alreadybr","perhap","harri","descent","mad","compel","hand","compet","director","ala","get","gui","name","lewi","jackson","appar","onli","show","action","jump","giddili","scene","scene","without","establish","shot","clear","view","actor","let","u","know","seeingbr","even","onc","get","roll","re","still","treat","heap","help","harri","selfpiti","insecur","neurot","behavior","depress","frighten","christma","evil","avoid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,6,8,9,11,14,16,17,19,26,28,30,36,37,38,41,50,51,55,56,58,63,64,68,71,76,83,93,98,112,114,115,124,125,129,143,154,156,158,164,180,185,199,210,227,234,235,236,242,252,257,262,264,283,308,312,318,321,335,347,390,406,407,431,441,484,561,590,595,6

{"value":"I could name plenty of funny movies. There are comedies that set out to be funny, and are. Some movies, like a Gymkata for example, try to be serious but end up funny. The Ladies Man is a film that is desperately trying to be funny, but could not be less funny if it was about a guy who got a lot of chicks in the middle of the wreckage of a nuclear holocaust. It's anti-funny.<br /><br />I don't think I laughed harder than a chuckle at anything in this movie. It's simply unfunny. It's boring, stupid, inane, annoying, mind-bogglingly bad, but not funny. I don't particularly care for Tim Meadows, or this character from SNL, but I expected better than this.<br /><br />The movie is completely lacking logic or common sense. It's like the script writer had a bag over his head while he was typing and he couldn't see which keys he was hitting. They tell the \"origin\" of the Ladies Man, but fail to include a motivation for his bizarre fascination with acting like it's still the seventies. The movie tries to get humor out of a man who appears to pleasuring himself to porn, shortly after he tried to hang himself. This is comedy? I like to consider myself having a pretty keen sense of humor (Spending a lot of time writing comedy as I do), but maybe I'm just not quite bright enough for this film.<br /><br />Lee Evans, so funny as Tucker in There's Something About Mary, is outrageously bad here. I was pleading with him in my head to shut up.<br /><br />By the end I was pounding on my chair, muttering under my breath, and had the film gone on any longer, would probably have attempted suicide. This film might not be as bad as Battlefield Earth, but it's the first movie I've seen that's come close.<br /><br

{"value":"This movie is like the material S.E. Hinton was writing in the 1970s and Copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s, and, had Trueblood actually been a product of either, the results might've been much better (especially in the acting department). Instead, we get a rather so-bad-its-funny piece of mediocrity.<br /><br />Jeff Fahey plays Ray Trueblood, a former street rumbler, I suppose is the accurate description. This was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and mid30s and dressed them up in greaser threads or some kind of more effeminate selection of gang garb and they fought to lousy 80s music. Nonetheless, Ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother, Donny (Chad Lowe in a part where he screams a lot), who he is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when, on the run from the cops, he is nabbed and forced to serve time in the Marines. Flash forward to present day and Ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs, although in a gang that was Ray's adversary and now old scores must be violently settled (and again, cops must be dodged and this time, a lady's honor defended in the action film sense) before Ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother, Donny.<br /><br />For the most part, the film is quite ridiculous. For me, most of this has to do with far too much overacting, although not by Fahey or Sherlyn Fenn who plays the waitress he befriends. The guys in the gang and Lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as New York street toughs. Although, the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of 1989.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","like","the","materi","se","hinton","be","write","in","the","and","copola","be","adapt","to","the","screen","in","the","earli","and","have","trueblood","actual","be","a","product","of","either","the","result","mai","have","be","much","well","especi","in","the","act","depart","instead","we","get","a","rather","sobaditsfunni","piec","of","mediocritybr","br","jeff","fahei","plai","rai","trueblood","a","former","street","rumbler","i","suppos","be","the","accur","descript","thi","be","in","the","dai","of","action","movi","that","us","gui","in","their","and","mid","and","dress","them","up","in","greaser","thread","or","some","kind","of","much","effemin","select","of","gang","garb","and","thei","fight","to","lousi","music","nonetheless","rai","be","the","lone","caretak","of","hi","young","brother","donni","chad","lowe","in","a","part","where","he","scream","a","lot","who","he","be","forc","to","leav","behind","inexplic","in","a","train","station","when","on","the","run","from","the","cop","he","be","nab","and","forc","to","serv","time","in","the","marin","flash","forward","to","present","dai","and","rai","be","back","in","town","and","look","for","hi","brother","who","have","conjur","becom","part","of","the","street","gang","although","in","a","gang","that","be","rai","adversari","and","now","old","score","must","be","violent","settl","and","again","cop","must","be","dodg","and","thi","time","a","ladi","honor","defend","in","the","action","film","sens","befor","rai","can","carri","on","life","at","normal","pace","with","hi","brother","donnybr","br","for","the","much","part","the","film","be","quit","ridicul","for","me","much","of","thi","have","to","do","with","far","too","much","overact","although","not","by","fahei","or","sherlyn","fenn","who","plai","the","waitress","he","befriend","the","gui","in","the","gang","and","lowe","himself","seem","to","do","quit","a","bite","of","needless","exagger","a","new","york","street","tough","although","the","big","hang","up","be","recycl","plot","line","and","perhap","a","kind","of","movi","that","be","good","past","it","prime","a","a","product","of"],"filtered":["thi","movi","like","materi","se","hinton","write","copola","adapt","screen","earli","trueblood","actual","product","either","result","mai","much","well","especi","act","depart","instead","get","rather","sobaditsfunni","piec","mediocritybr","br","jeff","fahei","plai","rai","trueblood","former","street","rumbler","suppos","accur","descript","thi","dai","action","movi","us","gui","mid","dress","greaser","thread","kind","much","effemin","select","gang","garb","thei","fight","lousi","music","nonetheless","rai","lone","caretak","hi","young","brother","donni","chad","lowe","part","scream","lot","forc","leav","behind","inexplic","train","station","run","cop","nab","forc","serv","time","marin","flash","forward","present","dai","rai","back","town","look","hi","brother","conjur","becom","part","street","gang","although","gang","rai","adversari","old","score","must","violent","settl","cop","must","dodg","thi","time","ladi","honor","defend","action","film","sens","befor","rai","carri","life","normal","pace","hi","brother","donnybr","br","much","part","film","quit","ridicul","much","thi","far","much","overact","although","fahei","sherlyn","fenn","plai","waitress","befriend","gui","gang","lowe","seem","quit","bite","needless","exagger","new","york","street","tough","although","big","hang","recycl","plot","line","perhap","kind","movi","good","past","prime","product"],"filtered2":["like","materi","se","hinton","write","copola","adapt","screen","earli","trueblood","actual","product","either","result","mai","well","especi","act","depart","instead","get","rather","sobaditsfunni","piec","mediocritybr","jeff","fahei","plai","rai","trueblood","former","street","rumbler","suppos","accur","descript","dai","action","us","gui","mid","dress","greaser","thread","kind","effemin","select","gang","garb","fight","lousi","music","nonetheless","rai","lone","caretak","young","brother","donni","chad","lowe","part","scream","lot","forc","leav","behind","inexplic","train","station","run","cop","nab","forc","serv","time","marin","flash","forward","present","dai","rai","back","town","look","brother","conjur","becom","part","street","gang","although","gang","rai","adversari","old","score","must","violent","settl","cop","must","dodg","time","ladi","honor","defend","action","sens","befor","rai","carri","life","normal","pace","brother","donnybr","part","quit","ridicul","far","overact","although","fahei","sherlyn","fenn","plai","waitress","befriend","gui","gang","lowe","seem","quit","bite","needless","exagger","new","york","street","tough","although","big","hang","recycl","plot","line","perhap","kind","good","past","prime","product"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,8,16,20,21,32,35,39,40,46,52,55,56,61,63,65,67,72,74,75,79,82,87,101,107,115,118,120,122,129,132,135,137,141,149,152,154,160,173,190,192,2

{"value":"This is a badly made, poor remake of Bimalda's classic Parineeta. The story is based on Sarat Chandra's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original. Well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity. The acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham. Shekar's father's choice of words in abusing Lolita ( Balan ) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. Again the scene where Shekhar ( Saif ) slaps Lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters, is quite jarring to the senses, and could have been easily avoided. Similarly the sex scene between Saif and Balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience. When a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys it's spirit, the work falls apart. The song \"piyu bole\" is quite OK. Another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where Saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father. This is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. On these counts this movie deserves 3 stars. The song and dance by Rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on. The song is tuneful but I remember having heard it somewhere before and if Iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized. <br /><br />Well, agreed the times have changed from then to now. But then this movie is not even reflective of the modern times.<br /><br />This is what happens when the modern Bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the NRIs and grabbing the lucrative NRI entertainment market. Such movies end up neither belonging to India nor to any other part of the world.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","badli","make","poor","remak","of","bimalda","classic","parineeta","the","stori","be","base","on","sarat","chandra","book","of","the","same","name","and","it","be","a","distort","of","the","origin","good","on","can","appreci","some","degre","of","creativ","but","not","sham","creativ","the","act","by","everyon","be","affect","and","the","entir","movi","be","a","sham","shekar","father","choic","of","word","in","abus","lolita","balan","sound","cheap","and","morbid","and","destroi","the","spirit","of","the","origin","stori","again","the","scene","where","shekhar","saif","slap","lolita","be","quit","out","of","place","with","the","flow","of","the","movi","and","the","charact","be","quit","jar","to","the","sens","and","can","have","be","easili","avoid","similarli","the","sex","scene","between","saif","and","balan","be","quit","unbecom","the","movi","and","a","cheap","gimmick","to","attract","the","audienc","when","a","creativ","work","be","not","faith","to","the","origin","and","destroi","it","spirit","the","work","fall","apart","the","song","piyu","bole","be","quit","okai","anoth","silver","line","in","the","dark","cloud","of","thi","movi","be","the","scene","where","saif","stand","up","for","himself","and","rebel","against","hi","father","thi","be","a","posit","departur","from","the","origin","and","deserv","credit","on","thi","count","thi","movi","deserv","star","the","song","and","danc","by","rekha","smack","of","artific","and","it","be","a","put","on","the","song","be","tune","but","i","rememb","have","hear","it","somewher","befor","and","if","iam","not","mistak","the","tune","appear","to","have","be","plagiar","br","br","good","agre","the","time","have","chang","from","then","to","now","but","then","thi","movi","be","not","even","reflect","of","the","modern","timesbr","br","thi","be","what","happen","when","the","modern","bollywood","film","maker","get","increasingli","obsess","with","impress","the","nri","and","grab","the","lucr","nri","entertain","market","such","movi","end","up","neither","belong","to","india","nor","to","ani","other","part","of","the","world"],"filtered":["thi","badli","make","poor","remak","bimalda","classic","parineeta","stori","base","sarat","chandra","book","name","distort","origin","good","appreci","degre","creativ","sham","creativ","act","everyon","affect","entir","movi","sham","shekar","father","choic","word","abus","lolita","balan","sound","cheap","morbid","destroi","spirit","origin","stori","scene","shekhar","saif","slap","lolita","quit","place","flow","movi","charact","quit","jar","sens","easili","avoid","similarli","sex","scene","saif","balan","quit","unbecom","movi","cheap","gimmick","attract","audienc","creativ","work","faith","origin","destroi","spirit","work","fall","apart","song","piyu","bole","quit","okai","anoth","silver","line","dark","cloud","thi","movi","scene","saif","stand","rebel","hi","father","thi","posit","departur","origin","deserv","credit","thi","count","thi","movi","deserv","star","song","danc","rekha","smack","artific","put","song","tune","rememb","hear","somewher","befor","iam","mistak","tune","appear","plagiar","br","br","good","agre","time","chang","thi","movi","even","reflect","modern","timesbr","br","thi","happen","modern","bollywood","film","maker","get","increasingli","obsess","impress","nri","grab","lucr","nri","entertain","market","movi","end","neither","belong","india","ani","part","world"],"filtered2":["badli","make","poor","remak","bimalda","classic","parineeta","stori","base","sarat","chandra","book","name","distort","origin","good","appreci","degre","creativ","sham","creativ","act","everyon","affect","entir","sham","shekar","father","choic","word","abus","lolita","balan","sound","cheap","morbid","destroi","spirit","origin","stori","scene","shekhar","saif","slap","lolita","quit","place","flow","charact","quit","jar","sens","easili","avoid","similarli","sex","scene","saif","balan","quit","unbecom","cheap","gimmick","attract","audienc","creativ","work","faith","origin","destroi","spirit","work","fall","apart","song","piyu","bole","quit","okai","anoth","silver","line","dark","cloud","scene","saif","stand","rebel","father","posit","departur","origin","deserv","credit","count","deserv","star","song","danc","rekha","smack","artific","put","song","tune","rememb","hear","somewher","befor","iam","mistak","tune","appear","plagiar","good","agre","time","chang","even","reflect","modern","timesbr","happen","modern","bollywood","maker","get","increasingli","obsess","impress","nri","grab","lucr","nri","entertain","market","end","neither","belong","india","ani","part","world"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,8,10,17,19,21,24,27,48,61,69,73,79,94,100,107,120,143,146,151,159,164,165,168,169,170,173,178,191,195,198,216,246,254,258,278,290,328,332,334,335,343,351,356,368,377,418,423,448,483,492,509,572,583,592,622,648,718,729,738,763,804,809,885,894,961,1072,1122,1125,1184,1243,1389,1490,1540,1550,1624,

{"value":"I don't know what you guys are inhaling, but please stop. This movie was complete trash.<br /><br />Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was lovable, cute, sweet, loving, and extremely fun to watch. He had that innocence but at the same time, he was strong as well.<br /><br />This new kid, Alex? Annoying as all hell! Just a blatant ripoff at trying to match Culkin's charm and grace, failing miserably at that.<br /><br />The villains, complete crap. Harry and Marv, they were such an entertaining on screen team. They were comedic, they were humorous, and just made you really want to root for Culkin even more, which is what a good villain is suppose to do. These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, absolutely PERFECT for those roles. On the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again, try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains. Not saying they were horrible, but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining. More on the corny side actually.<br /><br />Then we got the actual movies. Part 1 and 2, classics. Memorable. Perfect to watch around Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions. It makes you fall in love with the story, and care about the characters. Simply, memorable and close to being masterpieces. Part 3? Masterpiece of crap. Enough said.<br /><br />All and all, I don't know why people like this. I think people really don't know what a good movie is anymore.

{"value":"(aka: BLOOD CASTLE or SCREAM OF THE DEMON)<br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />This was a drive-in feature, co-billed with THE VELVET VAMPIRE. A Spanish-Italian co-production where a series of women in a village are being murdered around the same time a local count named Yanos Dalmar is seen on horseback, riding off with his 'man-eating' dog behind him.<br /><br />The townsfolk already suspect he is the one behind it all and want his castle burned down. The murders first began around the time Count Yanos' older brother, Count Igor Dalmar was horribly burned and killed in a lab accident.<br /><br />Then a woman Ivanna (Erna Schuer) that Igor hired before his death to assist him in his experiments shows up. Yanos agrees to hire her in place of his brother and together they seek the formulae for the regeneration of dead cells. Yanos wants to bring Igor's charred corpse back to life.<br /><br />But of course Igor is still alive (although horribly burned) and stalking and killing the women in the village. We see his char-broiled face appear at various points in the film, so we know he's still alive, making the whole thing seem a little bit too obvious.<br /><br />Igor meets another fiery end when he gets into a fight with Yanos over Ivanna, with the burning candles falling on to the same bed that Igor stumbles on to, meeting yet another, final char-broiled end.<br /><br />The Retromedia DVD is taken from a VHS source and looks quite grainy and bad. Other than an even scratchier trailer, no other extras are included. Although it has a nice, creepy Spanish castle and good atmospherics, I found it to be fairly boring and predictable, with no excitement or mystery, whatsoever. <br /><br />3 out of

{"value":"This movie was extremely depressing. <br /><br />The characters were so cold. The mother, who is he main character, is everything but \"motherly\". OK, she was unhappy in her marriage and always put her husband and children first. Her husband dies. She then goes to visit her son and meets this hunk who is sleeping with her daughter and ends up sleeping with him. Until this part, the movie is all right. Not excellent, but it can be watched. The guy is charming and who can blame her? OK it's not very motherly to sleep with your daughter's lover but let's blame that on the shock of losing her husband. <br /><br />She becomes totally obsessed with the guy. I think this is the part where I started to dislike the movie. She's always there wanting to please him in an \"old fashioned way\" with snacks while he is working on her son's house (I guess this is the only thing she ever learned to do), as if it was the only way she could get his attention. The guy obviously is not very interested (actually, it seems more like he considered sleeping with her a charitable activity) and instead of being insulted by that, she continues to beg him to go to go to bed with her and to be nice to her when he becomes very abusive. \"I want to please you\", she tells him in a desperate way while he is insulting her very badly. <br /><br />What outraged me in this movie, is the utter lack of self-respect the mother has for herself.

{"value":"Okay so i found out about this movie and I watched the preview read almost all the reviews and was having a hard time debating whether I should watch it or not. Before i even watched the movie i was emotionally weird on it. i was so unsure if i was going to watch this and be disturbed for like a long time. So i choose to risk it and watched it and heres what i thought: The beginning started off fine for me. It seemed to be heading in a decent direction. Got past the rape scene and i couldn't figure why people were so disturbed or bored by the movie. Don't get me wrong the rape scene was just as sad and scary but it didn't really bother me to a dramatic point. Then as the middle came in i understood the boring stuff that was going on. There was like 5 minutes shots of nothing but people walking around saying or showing nothing! its one thing to have a shot where a person is showing some kind of emotion but this movie didn't have that. It had about 3 of these pointless scenes, where you see the main character Maya kind of get out of control but it didn't show it right making me want to fast forward. Then when she engaged in the hardcore partying it wasn't so boring but still a little dull. Oh and as a note Rosario Dawson still did a great job. Okay moving on so finally after an hour of pointlessness to the middle the revenge comes to Maya's attention. Thats where it got disturbing. I didn't feel bad for him or nothing he got what he deserved but the whole scene was really disturbing and i just felt all eck after it. I cant really tell you whether or not to watch this movie because its so...i don't know i cant find a word to sum it up.

{"value":"Yeah, well, I definitely had regrets about giving up my Saturday night watching this strange little, yet very long, movie. Apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life. Here's the epitome of the antihero in 'No Regrets.' We have this jerk, so messed up, so wandering, so selfish, aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman's up-and-coming son, Jaemin, unless it was just that: physical attraction. He claims otherwise, that it's love. But after watching this, it's like loving Charles Manson because you dig the beard. (Alright, he's not that bad, but still no real redeemable characteristics.) I could never get past the reason Jaemin endless stalks Sumin. It was never shown, just told, that Jaemin loves Sumin. Perhaps it's a culture thing that flew over my head: crazy/stalking = mad love over in Seoul. It has to be, because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point I thought this was turning into a screwball comedy. I was waiting for a tiger named \"baby\" to make an appearance. Okay, so Sumin works two jobs while going to school, so far so good on someone trying to better themselves. But after his first taste of his stalker's attraction, he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring. What? OK, well, as previously mentioned, the obsession doesn't stop due to the job/career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup.

{"value":"Nobody, but nobody, could chew the scenery like the Divine One, Ruth Elizabeth Davis, and \"Elizabeth and Essex\" is a great example why. Although she overplays the part at times, watch her when she gawfs about Raliegh writing the lyrics to a song her ladies-in-waiting are about to play: in that one moment, she makes us understand how Elizabeth was able to rule and rule absolutely! At other times, she is done in by the script's sappiness. When Elizabeth has to be vulnerable, she comes off as weak and shrewish. This has the added effect of undermining her authority: when she blows her stack and threatens to dispense justice, it's hard to take her seriously.<br /><br />Flynn exudes charm, making us see how Essex was able to worm his way into Elizabeth's heart, but he is totally inept at conveying the complexity and sheer evil of the man. It also doesn't help that Essex is badly underwritten. Why is he this hothead who wants to overthrow his Queen - even as he swears fidelity to her - except only that he is more blue-blooded, thus, more \"worthy\" of rule? And why does Raliegh betray Elizabeth by intercepting her and Essex's letters? He's in no risk of falling out of favor, and we know where Essex (and his head) is headed. So why does he risk his own head by speeding up the inevitable?<br /><br />What did Curtiz do with all the $$$ he was given? He doesn't even bother to try to hide the fact that his battle scenes are shot on a sound stage. He should've ended it with Elizabeth the first time alone at The Tower; everything else that follows (especially the final scene between her and Essex) is unnecessary. The costumes are fantastic.

{"value":"I'm not sure quite why I clicked \"contains spoiler\", because quite honestly there is not enough explanation ever given in the movie to know enough of what is supposed to be going on to spoil it.<br /><br />Visually it mostly delivers. Well, apart from some 80's throwback rubber-mask monsters. I'll say now that before watching this I had never seen the band Lordi, nor knew anything about them bar that they won Eurovision. Apparently the monsters in this are members of the band, pretty much in their stage personas. Whatever. Anyway, I didn't know this while watching. I just thought the monsters/demons were mostly passable. Just about.<br /><br />I'm almost sure there is a semi-coherent explanation behind what we see on-screen, but it may actually be better not to know it. It probably would actually have been incredibly lame come to think on it. The action keeps it rolling along pretty much well enough to keep the viewer mostly entertained, even if half the entertainment factor is joking about wtf is supposed to be happening in this movie exactly.<br /><br />I gave it a four mainly because I got a good laugh out of it, especially out of how it explains pretty much nothing. Must have been the mood I was in, but I found that hella funny for some reason. Then I look up the movie on the internet and find out that NOBODY knows what the hell it's supposed to be about. That amused me further, and raised my score an extra half point to a 4/10.<br /><br />It's not scary, or particularly coherent, but it's pretty nice visually and sonically. Overall, far from essential, but watchable.

{"value":"We all have seen some unending epics in our times, but this one really tops them all! The movie is so long and so slow, that, just to put things in perspective, i felt a lot older when i left movie hall, than I entered it. At almost 4 hours length, it could have rather been made into a tele-serial.<br /><br />What starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace. Nikhil advani has woven the plot around 6 love stories and he cant make justice to any one of them... There is no interconnection between them to start with, and links shown in last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to connect the story.<br /><br />Situation is made worse by Silly dialogues (most of them repeated in Hindi cinema over years)and stupid cinematography.<br /><br />Priyanka doesn't realise that she actually needs to play her role rather than just looking glam on screen... An utter waste of beauty without acting skills.<br /><br />And then there is loud-is-humorous Govinda & my-face-twists-better-than-jim-carrey Akshay Khanna who keep belching at the top of their lungs to irritate already tired viewers.<br /><br />Only good part in movie is John & Vidya's love story & nice acting/comedy by sohail & Isha. But they are so good at their roles that just these two couples could have justified the movie without jumbling it with other bunch of characters. Their brilliance gets lost in the midst of other substandard plot lines.<br /><br />My guess - Director was making two separate movies(may be more!) and some beginner assistant mixed up all the records, beyond a point of sorting them out, so director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie...<br /><br />Watch it only if you want to test your

{"value":"Veteran sleazeball Bruno Mattei is at it again with this erotic thriller that clearly echoes Joel Schumacher's 8MM. But, as expected, Mattei does his movie on a minuscule budget - so that it already looks obscure when it's newly released.<br /><br />After her daughter gets abducted, a mother enters the dark world of underground pornography, because the kidnappers belong to an international organization that direct snuff films as long as the exclusive clients pay well. The search for her daughter does not only lead the mother across Europe, but also into prostitution. She goes to bed with some guys to get her clues. When she finally reaches contact with the snuff organization lead by the mysterious Doctor Hades, she's getting into great danger herself.<br /><br />There is not much good to say about this one, even though it starts promising. Problem is that the movie is by far not as sleazy or explicit as one might expect from the director who made films like BLADE VIOLENT. SNUFF TRAP (which was first released in Russia!) is neither gory enough nor does it contain the amount of nudity and sex to really keep the viewer's attention. The plot isn't that special either, except maybe for the surprisingly many different locations throughout Europe. The ending is hugely disappointing. The acting isn't really remarkable either, except for Anita Auer who plays Doctor Hades: She looks and acts extremely creepy. You don't want to meet her like this in a dark alley (or Your bedroom, for that matter).<br /><br />All in all, SNUFF TRAP only appeals to collectors of Bruno Mattei's films. But it's good to see the man back on the helm again: It was his first thriller since 1994's giallo GLI OCCHI

{"value":"Have I seen a worse movie? Perhaps only \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\" dragged more than \"Dukes\". I had more fun poking at the gigantic plot holes than the movie gave me at any point. Let's touch on a few...<br /><br />There was a noticeable script death and rebirth when Sheev is talking to the Dukes and they don't respond. He shrugs and moves on, since neither the Knoxville or Scott know what he's talking about (nor do we). It was like the engine died and was restarted.<br /><br />The few times the General Lee flew through the air weren't even that exciting. Nothing I haven't seen on the TV Series.<br /><br />Very little chemistry between Knoxville and Scott. The best part was when Bo is upset at Luke for stealing the girl he liked. The only reason this works is that the script actually forshadowed it (although roughly). The rest of the time it seems distant and forced.<br /><br />Seann William Scott's awful, horrendous accent (or lack thereof).<br /><br />I hated Willie Nelson's performance. Were bad jokes supposed to be endearing? I wanted him to disappear.<br /><br />Jessica Simpson comes across splendidly on the big screen. She actually felt like one of the better actors in the film. That's telling you how horrible this movie is. She's a goddess.<br /><br />During the climax of the film, I was rooting for Boss Hogg and the bad guys to flatten all of Hazzard County, starting with Willie Nelson and his accomplices. A nuclear bomb would have sufficed.<br /><br />This is not meant to be a coherent dismantling of the film, but a release of frustration at the abysmal writing and execution of what could have been a

{"value":"A bit of a disappointing film, I'd say: the acting was stilted, somehow. In many cases, I just couldn't feel that the facial expressions matched the words spoken or the intent of the scene. An angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character should make the viewer believe that he's angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). That doesn't happen here.<br /><br />The comment about the writers assuming you already know the characters was apt. They do things and say things which come out of nowhere: the character Andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner; then he blows up and storms out, telling his father \"Don't touch me, you f***!\". Maybe, if we'd seen the prequel, we would understand where all that comes from, but there is no prequel, so we're somewhat at sea as to the reason! <br /><br />One odd, quirky thing that Andrew does is to go to an old stone quarry, sit down on the edge overlooking the \"still water\" below; then he reaches into his jeans pocket and extracts a pack of cigarettes and lights one up. He did this same thing three times during the film; I guess we're supposed to see this as some tortured act of being alone and angry? Maybe once, but three times? It might even have been four times, I lost count.<br /><br />To be honest, there is the fact that he's recently found out that he's adopted; this happens very early in the film so there's no sense of any dramatic change he might be undergoing because of this discovery. It's not really clear if that's why he's so bitter or if it's about something else.<br /><br />I guess there is a sort of Lynchian feel to the film but should a first-time director really be trying to

{"value":"\"Masters of Horror\" has proved itself a poor arena for 'message episodes,' and while a definite case can be made for Joe Dante's 'Screwfly Solution' (one of the best episodes of the series, period), most efforts to do so have come across as anvil-heavy and unimpressive (nothing defuses horror more than a soapbox). And 'Pro-Life' simply fuses reactionary viewpoints with ultra-violence; young Angelique (Caitlin Wachs), seen running through the woods, is nearly hit by 2 doctors (Mark Feuerstein and Emmanuelle Vaugier) who just happen to be driving in to work at the local (and isolated) abortion clinic. Angelique's father, Dwayne (Ron Perlman), is a stone-cold, far-right holy roller who will do anything to prevent his daughter from getting an abortion. If for nothing else, 'Pro-Life' accumulated some buzz for its controversial issue, but John Carpenter treats this whole venture with startling indifference--he seems even less interested in making a movie than the script itself (which is admittedly poor); the slow pacing builds no tension, and simply brings the already ambling plot to a crawl. Even when Dwayne and his sons storm the clinic, guns blazing, it is a stunning non-event; later, when a doctor is tortured with a 'male abortion,' the scene comes off as gratuitous and unnecessary--an effort to pad out the underwritten film. The poor performances (Perlman is sadly wasted here) become an outgrowth of the script, and Carpenter's direction feels exhausted, as if 'Pro-Life' is the source of his next hot meal. By the time a spider-creature with a human head and a guy in a latex monster suit are prowling the hallways, you just have to wonder what the minds behind this mess were

{"value":"I'd been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much. I consider both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what Dan Reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn't work for me.<br /><br />The problem lies in the fact that the film doesn't really seem to understand which genre it's falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama, horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it's a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none.<br /><br />The premise (as with most revenge films) is simple, couple meet and go out, something bad happens and they get their revenge it's a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years. Unfotunately in this case it's as if Dan Reed thought, \"It'd be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail....\" Wrong! There are also a few key elements missing, in this type of movie there's generally some kind of warning. A don't do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there's nothing of the sort here. It just simply happens, then nothing happens for an hour, then something interesting happens and then it ends.<br /><br />There's a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to Dan Reed for trying, I have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing... I'd say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he's making instead of trying to be too clever and he'll have a quality movie on his hands.","finished_norm":["i","have","be","follow","thi","film","progress","for","quit","some","time","so","perhap","expect","a","littl","too","much","i","consid","both","gillian","anderson","and","danni","dyer","to","be","good","at","what","thei","do","and","be","interest","to","see","what","dan","re","can","come","up","with","but","unfortun","it","just","do","not","work","for","mebr","br","the","problem","lie","in","the","fact","that","the","film","doe","not","realli","seem","to","understand","which","genr","it","fall","into","and","a","such","it","fail","to","impress","on","drama","horror","and","thriller","elem","becaus","rather","than","focu","on","on","of","them","and","do","it","good","it","a","bite","of","a","jack","of","all","trade","and","master","of","nonebr","br","the","premis","a","with","much","reveng","film","be","simpl","coupl","meet","and","go","out","someth","bad","happen","and","thei","get","their","reveng","it","a","simpl","formula","and","on","that","mani","director","have","handl","expertli","over","the","year","unfotun","in","thi","case","it","a","if","dan","re","think","it","have","be","great","to","do","on","of","that","reveng","film","that","go","a","littl","deep","by","show","a","much","human","side","to","all","the","charact","and","delv","into","their","mental","state","in","much","detail","wrong","there","be","conjur","a","few","kei","elem","miss","in","thi","typ","of","movi","there","gener","some","kind","of","warn","a","do","not","do","thi","or","thi","mai","happen","elem","which","add","to","the","tension","but","there","noth","of","the","sort","here","it","just","simpli","happen","then","noth","happen","for","a","hour","then","someth","interest","happen","and","then","it","endsbr","br","there","a","lot","of","realli","stiff","competit","in","thi","genr","and","hat","of","to","dan","re","for","try","i","have","no","issu","with","hi","direct","abil","but","in","term","of","write","i","have","sai","next","time","he","should","stick","to","the","formula","for","the","typ","of","film","he","make","instead","of","try","to","be","too","clever","and","he","will","have","a","qualiti","movi","on","hi","hand"],"filtered":["follow","thi","film","progress","quit","time","perhap","expect","littl","much","consid","gillian","anderson","danni","dyer","good","thei","interest","see","dan","re","come","unfortun","work","mebr","br","problem","lie","fact","film","doe","realli","seem","understand","genr","fall","fail","impress","drama","horror","thriller","elem","becaus","rather","focu","good","bite","jack","trade","master","nonebr","br","premis","much","reveng","film","simpl","coupl","meet","go","someth","bad","happen","thei","get","reveng","simpl","formula","mani","director","handl","expertli","year","unfotun","thi","case","dan","re","think","great","reveng","film","go","littl","deep","show","much","human","side","charact","delv","mental","state","much","detail","wrong","conjur","kei","elem","miss","thi","typ","movi","gener","kind","warn","thi","thi","mai","happen","elem","add","tension","noth","sort","simpli","happen","noth","happen","hour","someth","interest","happen","endsbr","br","lot","realli","stiff","competit","thi","genr","hat","dan","re","try","issu","hi","direct","abil","term","write","sai","next","time","stick","formula","typ","film","make","instead","try","clever","qualiti","movi","hi","hand"],"filtered2":["follow","progress","quit","time","perhap","expect","littl","consid","gillian","anderson","danni","dyer","good","interest","see","dan","re","come","unfortun","work","mebr","problem","lie","fact","doe","realli","seem","understand","genr","fall","fail","impress","drama","horror","thriller","elem","becaus","rather","focu","good","bite","jack","trade","master","nonebr","premis","reveng","simpl","coupl","meet","go","someth","bad","happen","get","reveng","simpl","formula","mani","director","handl","expertli","year","unfotun","case","dan","re","think","great","reveng","go","littl","deep","show","human","side","charact","delv","mental","state","detail","wrong","conjur","kei","elem","miss","typ","gener","kind","warn","mai","happen","elem","add","tension","noth","sort","simpli","happen","noth","happen","hour","someth","interest","happen","endsbr","lot","realli","stiff","competit","genr","hat","dan","re","try","issu","direct","abil","term","write","next","time","stick","formula","typ","make","instead","try","clever","qualiti","hand"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,8,9,10,12,13,14,18,22,25,28,34,35,36,39,46,48,49,50,51,53,57,58,60,65,68,72,83,94,97,102,120,122,130,152,154,160,167,169,174,201,212,215,225,227,235,253,255,260,269,288,292,297,299,317,318,319,350,384,416,418,425,463,467,479,484,498,527,619,650,714,736,740,777,806,834,847,858,871,887,911,945,955,1059,1176,1236,1504,1696,1732,1745,1843,2081,2136,2668,2801,5138,5283,6249,7538],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE IF YOU LOVED THE CLASSICS SUCH AS TOM WOPAT, JOHN SCHNEIDER, CATHERINE BACH, SORRELL BOOKE, JAMES BEST, DENVER PYLE, SONNY SHROYER, AND BEN JONES! THIS MOVIE WILL DISSAPPOINT YOU BADLY! First of all, this movie starts out with Bo and Luke running moonshine for Jesse. Bo and Luke would not do that ever on the real series! This movie portrays unimaginable characters doing things that never would have happened in the series. In the series, Uncle Jesse was honest, and law-abiding. In this movie, he is a criminal who is making moonshine and smoking weed with the governor of Georgia. Plus, if this was an extension adding on to the Dukes of Hazzard Reunion! and the Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood, I have one question: HOW COULD UNCLE JESSE BE MAKING MOONSHINE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE DUKES OF HAZZARD IN Hollywood MOVIE? AND HOW IS BOSS HOGG ALIVE WHEN HE DIED BEFORE THE REUNION MOVIE IN 1997! MOVIE AND ROSCO RAN HAZZARD? IT SEEMS MAGICAL THAT THESE CHARACTERS CAME BACK TO LIFE, WHEN THEY HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR 11 AND 8 YEARS? If Hollywood really wanted to make a good movie, they should have brought back James Best, John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Ben Jones, and Catherine Bach like they did in 1997 and 2000 and made a family friendly movie with the living original characters that made the show what it was and still is compared to this disgusting, disgraced movie! If you want to see good Dukes movies, either buy the original series, or go out to walmart.com and buy the DVD set of 2 that includes the Reunion, and Dukes of Hazzard in Hollywood movies!

{"value":"This Italian semi-horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good, that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes. The only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film. The story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon, go berserk and seemingly kill them. They show the nudity, but they never really show the murders at this point in the film. Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her. He has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife Evelyn was also one, she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience's business. After a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes, foxes and such. At this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely. This movie just did not work for me, it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film. Explaining Evelyn's death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where Evelyn did rise from the grave. Granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave, just not under her own power. The gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too.

{"value":"I don't see how anyone who even likes Van Damne could like this movie.<br /><br />The movie actually starts out with some promise. I would say the action scenes at the beginning of the movie is excellent. The actions scenes with the family ward trying to save the twins is a great start and is good lead in to the main story. However, the film is all down hill from there. <br /><br />It would have been nice if the director could have stayed with the original premise. That is the brothers are born in different parts of the world and thus learn different skills. One brother is supposed to be skilled in Martial Arts, but the other brother is supposed to be skilled in firearms. How convenient when the time arises that the brother who has never picked up a gun before all of the sudden is a great marksman, and the brother who has not been taught any martial arts is all of the sudden doing the splits and high kicks.<br /><br />The plot, action, etc. are just plain ridiculous. My favorite scenes? How about when Van Damne is confronting an armed soldier with an AK-47. The soldier is about 100 yards away. Instead of aiming and shooting at Van Damne he is doing a war cry like he is wielding a battle axe and running at him. Van Damne proceeds to pick up a pistol from a fallen soldier and shoots him,...while he is still about 75 to 80 yards away. <br /><br />This movie has one of the most disappointing endings. Bolo Yeung is a skilled martial artist. However, instead of choreographing a decent fight. Bolo is throwing barrels at Van Damne like Donkey Kong.
