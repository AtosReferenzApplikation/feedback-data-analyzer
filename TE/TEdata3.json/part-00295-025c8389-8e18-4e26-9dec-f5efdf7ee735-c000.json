{"value":"I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's late then I'm pretty forgiving of movies. Although I tried, I just could not stand this movie at all, it kept getting worse and worse as the movie went on. Although I know it's suppose to be a comedy but I didn't find it very funny. It was also an especially unrealistic, and jaded portrayal of rural life. In case this is what any of you think country life is like, it's definitely not. I do have to agree that some of the guy cast members were cute, but the french guy was really fake. I do have to agree that it tried to have a good lesson in the story, but overall my recommendation is that no one over 8 watch it, it's just too annoying.","finished_norm":["i","watch","thi","movi","realli","late","last","night","and","usual","if","it","late","then","i","be","pretti","forgiv","of","movi","although","i","try","i","just","can","not","stand","thi","movi","at","all","it","keep","get","wrong","and","wrong","a","the","movi","go","on","although","i","know","it","suppos","to","be","a","comedi","but","i","do","not","find","it","veri","funni","it","be","conjur","a","especi","unrealist","and","jade","portray","of","rural","life","in","case","thi","be","what","ani","of","you","think","countri","life","be","like","it","definit","not","i","do","have","to","agre","that","some","of","the","gui","cast","member","be","cute","but","the","french","gui","be","realli","fake","i","do","have","to","agre","that","it","try","to","have","a","good","lesson","in","the","stori","but","overal","my","recommend","be","that","no","on","over","watch","it","it","just","too","annoi"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","realli","late","last","night","usual","late","pretti","forgiv","movi","although","try","stand","thi","movi","keep","get","wrong","wrong","movi","go","although","know","suppos","comedi","find","veri","funni","conjur","especi","unrealist","jade","portray","rural","life","case","thi","ani","think","countri","life","like","definit","agre","gui","cast","member","cute","french","gui","realli","fake","agre","try","good","lesson","stori","overal","recommend","watch","annoi"],"filtered2":["watch","realli","late","last","night","usual","late","pretti","forgiv","although","try","stand","keep","get","wrong","wrong","go","although","know","suppos","comedi","find","veri","funni","conjur","especi","unrealist","jade","portray","rural","life","case","ani","think","countri","life","like","definit","agre","gui","cast","member","cute","french","gui","realli","fake","agre","try","good","lesson","stori","overal","recommend","watch","annoi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,7,12,13,15,17,25,26,27,36,38,39,55,62,75,78,92,127,134,144,149,150,210,237,265,267,271,288,298,377,392,412,608,618,622,639,855,899,1264,1272,1311,1422,4719,5502],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,7,12,13,15,17,25,26,27,36,38,39,55,62,75,78,92,127,134,144,149,150,210,237,265,267,271,288,298,377,392,412,608,618,622,639,855,899,1264,1272,1311,1422,4719,5502],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,2.559277576165403,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,2.9360366939211433,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,3.9073995778510735,2.0226120445069267,3.948450049740535,2.0064197866819473,2.0489535369135887,2.4359679371086367,2.2443961816702407,2.2931108769894046,2.3253197803590226,4.665424022293026,2.687151791517189,5.280195575021108,2.73529586597515,2.7085302779237206,2.757740698455715,2.8015621426949333,2.7819920465008363,3.0602441305135506,3.0670934723591254,3.107414446935464,3.616452760127359,3.5642670069567886,6.986785334740263,3.616452760127359,3.9201351739255808,4.197121957260614,4.327618446189983,4.416284083275639,4.456830177669989,4.484804029712395,6.1754673820690815,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247357E-4,2.154078066332398E-4,2.154609924846837E-4,2.1541767793321648E-4,2.1543806466120736E-4,2.1540661893957875E-4,2.154736133886263E-4,2.1537456994793303E-4,2.1540785215747767E-4,2.1563045283100636E-4,2.173414177127578E-4,2.1540820795554647E-4,2.1561221314088613E-4,2.1563467621359264E-4,2.1553671901055046E-4,2.154185264322714E-4,2.1549263873662987E-4,2.1559405030503588E-4,2.154296475619731E-4,2.154288599298074E-4,2.1562267093784898E-4,2.1545044370220871E-4,2.1545076976778373E-4,2.1558878983769214E-4,2.1542972527287152E-4,2.1563725358021148E-4,2.154836357275368E-4,2.1540732385964896E-4,2.155049803348707E-4,2.1557075556130376E-4,2.1545150052150496E-4,2.1556689165339263E-4,2.1567272961560578E-4,2.1587290735061623E-4,2.154832633657562E-4,2.1541839577752023E-4,2.1549606627473247E-4,2.1544027352728243E-4,2.153747998203632E-4,2.1542958084691698E-4,2.1564547810166152E-4,2.155271829826657E-4,2.1556738289319738E-4,2.153855190001098E-4,2.1542963562520197E-4,2.1541831477197852E-4,2.1549123191840137E-4,2.1552859836735774E-4,2.154847718447856E-4,2.154506171277406E-4,2.1541884748491806E-4,2.1586020571993602E-4,2.1547305307223878E-4,2.1542958624900298E-4,2.154718991342329E-4,2.1540754425062412E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476595E-4,2.1541914990540816E-4,2.1540742129050458E-4,2.1557975239475927E-4,2.154932132780452E-4,2.1540733124454653E-4,2.1538543124717893E-4,2.1536377186288138E-4,2.155584948043905E-4,2.1541788389403295E-4,2.1551580485178973E-4,2.1557905327695382E-4,2.1548124925554267E-4,2.154298715783535E-4,2

{"value":"This movie has some fatal flaws in it, how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable. Then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the Dr.'s office, is just bad writing or bad editing. <br /><br />Very very very predictable movie. <br /><br />I am not sure how this film got made, except it is was filmed in Canada, and probably received a government grant. <br /><br />I must say the person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did a good job.<br /><br />Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then I would say it will kill some time, but otherwise, it is a movie no actor would want on their

{"value":"Follow-up to 1973's far better \"Cleopatra Jones\" has statuesque black actress Tamara Dobson returning to her signature role as chic, super-tough narcotics agent, here busting a heroin ring in Hong Kong. Cross-pollination of blaxploitation action-flick and kung-fu B-movie is fun at the outset but eventually flags. The shoot-out finale is right off the assembly-line, and Dobson herself seems less energetic than before (she's still sexy, and she puts a unique spin on her comically-stilted dialogue, but these surroundings may have been too much of one thing for her--she's jaded). Stella Stevens plays the villainess this time; she's good, but can't match Shelley Winters in the predecessor. ** from

{"value":"Trifling romantic drama directed by Clint Eastwood about the loving relationship which grows between a comely hippie (Kay Lenz) and a Los Angeles real estate agent in his golden years (William Holden, surprisingly affable within this highly-concocted arrangement). The script is slight but not without some thoughtful passages; still, the scenario is such a middle-aged cliché by now that most of the picture comes off as puerile. It may have worked much better with different leads: Holden and Lenz don't match up well (her stature is so slight he seems to tower over her), making their intimate scenes less stirring than simply uncomfortable.

{"value":"I went to school with Jeremy Earl, that is how I heard of this movie, I don't really know if it was in the theater's at all. I don't recall the name. I have seen it, it is like one of those after school specials. The acting is OK, not great. The plot was kind of weak and the lines were pretty corny. So the only comment I can give this movie is \"Eh\" I borrowed the movie from Jeremy, if I was in a movie rental place, this is one that I would walk past and after watching it I wouldn't recommend it to anyone past middle school age. I've also noticed that many times when urban kids are portrayed, the slang is overused or just outdated. Many times I think thats what makes their characters unbelievable.","finished_norm":["i","go","to","school","with","jeremi","earl","that","be","how","i","hear","of","thi","movi","i","do","not","realli","know","if","it","be","in","the","theater","at","all","i","do","not","recal","the","name","i","have","see","it","it","be","like","on","of","that","after","school","special","the","act","be","okai","not","great","the","plot","be","kind","of","weak","and","the","line","be","pretti","corni","so","the","onli","comment","i","can","give","thi","movi","be","eh","i","borrow","the","movi","from","jeremi","if","i","be","in","a","movi","rental","place","thi","be","on","that","i","would","walk","past","and","after","watch","it","i","would","not","recommend","it","to","anyon","past","middl","school","ag","i","have","conjur","notic","that","mani","time","when","urban","kid","be","portrai","the","slang","be","overus","or","just","outdat","mani","time","i","think","that","what","make","their","charact","unbeliev"],"filtered":["go","school","jeremi","earl","hear","thi","movi","realli","know","theater","recal","name","see","like","school","special","act","okai","great","plot","kind","weak","line","pretti","corni","onli","comment","give","thi","movi","eh","borrow","movi","jeremi","movi","rental","place","thi","walk","past","watch","recommend","anyon","past","middl","school","ag","conjur","notic","mani","time","urban","kid","portrai","slang","overus","outdat","mani","time","think","make","charact","unbeliev"],"filtered2":["go","school","jeremi","earl","hear","realli","know","theater","recal","name","see","like","school","special","act","okai","great","plot","kind","weak","line","pretti","corni","onli","comment","give","eh","borrow","jeremi","rental","place","walk","past","watch","recommend","anyon","past","middl","school","ag","conjur","notic","mani","time","urban","kid","portrai","slang","overus","outdat","mani","time","think","make","charact","unbeliev"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,21,26,30,32,39,50,51,78,107,114,122,143,158,164,191,203,216,280,294,296,298,379,424,440,442,469,554,571,688,1485,1505,1703,1962,3137,3177,3528,4078,4217,4947],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,21,26,30,32,39,50,51,78,107,114,122,143,158,164,191,203,216,280,294,296,298,379,424,440,442,469,554,571,688,1485,1505,1703,1962,3137,3177,3528,4078,4217,4947],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,3.43598877114071,1.7139899308309823,2.0064197866819473,2.1439533986393955,2.4433074195966826,2.2489347673732487,2.3409902041158843,2.3106972614914807,2.3930275298746078,2.5460113484259455,2.569760528637609,2.6070186965339692,2.8028805344481915,2.886778509330039,8.851369705900094,2.7819920465008363,3.1272886331425473,3.212973749990824,6.425947499981648,3.257696649984802,3.328770687675578,3.439602492783994,3.467417180966871,3.6016814428070463,4.566029469634981,4.535724120139652,4.6973654716960676,4.8796870284900224,5.501738287366237,11.39178860361439,5.604922523601468,5.878215858601149,6.342521466732247,6.101359409915359]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805344E-4,2.1925531043720585E-4,2.1930944626706022E-4,2.1926535805328178E-4,2.1928610891855588E-4,2.1925410152956955E-4,2.193222925991184E-4,2.1922148009526638E-4,2.192553567745743E-4,2.1948193342720773E-4,2.2122345868647698E-4,2.1925571892772582E-4,2.1946336794909395E-4,2.1948623224568847E-4,2.1938652538130754E-4,2.192662217077918E-4,2.1934165776813384E-4,2.194448806979817E-4,2.192775414774105E-4,2.1927673977696285E-4,2.194740125378645E-4,2.1929870906764096E-4,2.192990409572321E-4,2.1943952627086726E-4,2.1927762057634114E-4,2.1948885564790848E-4,2.1933249395190814E-4,2.1925481904056063E-4,2.19354219805675E-4,2.1942116987548008E-4,2.1929978476330165E-4,2.1941723695242685E-4,2.1952496533805864E-4,2.197287185451421E-4,2.193321149391923E-4,2.1926608871935242E-4,2.1934514652716475E-4,2.1928835723826433E-4,2.1922171407356001E-4,2.1927747357072423E-4,2.1949722707154397E-4,2.1937681902578176E-4,2.1941773696650515E-4,2.192326247137996E-4,2.1927752932743088E-4,2.1926600626693128E-4,2.1934022582203942E-4,2.193782596913495E-4,2.1933365036190075E-4,2.192988855908108E-4,2.1926654849491623E-4,2.1971579004444674E-4,2.1932172227464683E-4,2.1927747906929957E-4,2.1932054772559189E-4,2.1925504336804642E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.192892508163026E-4,2.1926685631708606E-4,2.1925491821167626E-4,2.1943032740576215E-4,2.1934224257171337E-4,2.1925482655736346E-4,2.1923253539347085E-4,2.1921048914035562E-4,2.1940869012321285E-4,2.1926556769286476E-4,2

{"value":"Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors which I am always interested in seeing, despite reviews. I have always found Ms. Ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles, and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching.<br /><br />I say \"nearly\" and \"almost\" in large part because of this movie.<br /><br />First off, Meg Ryan does not play a likeable character, she plays a weak-willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesn't give up until several days later. That said, Kevin Kline's character is even more annoying and less likeable. So, even if you normally like these two actors, I recommend your give this movie a pass.","finished_norm":["kevin","kline","and","meg","ryan","be","among","that","class","of","actor","which","i","be","alwai","interest","in","see","despit","review","i","have","alwai","find","m","ryan","to","be","a","charm","and","winsom","actress","in","nearli","all","her","role","and","kevin","kline","be","almost","alwai","worth","watchingbr","br","i","sai","nearli","and","almost","in","larg","part","becaus","of","thi","moviebr","br","off","meg","ryan","doe","not","plai","a","likeabl","charact","she","plai","a","weakwil","whiner","who","begin","grate","on","your","nerv","shortli","after","the","open","credit","and","doe","not","give","up","until","sever","dai","late","that","sai","kevin","kline","charact","be","even","much","annoi","and","littl","likeabl","so","even","if","you","normal","like","thi","two","actor","i","recommend","your","give","thi","movi","a","pass"],"filtered":["kevin","kline","meg","ryan","among","class","actor","alwai","interest","see","despit","review","alwai","find","m","ryan","charm","winsom","actress","nearli","role","kevin","kline","almost","alwai","worth","watchingbr","br","sai","nearli","almost","larg","part","becaus","thi","moviebr","br","meg","ryan","doe","plai","likeabl","charact","plai","weakwil","whiner","begin","grate","nerv","shortli","open","credit","doe","give","sever","dai","late","sai","kevin","kline","charact","even","much","annoi","littl","likeabl","even","normal","like","thi","two","actor","recommend","give","thi","movi","pass"],"filtered2":["kevin","kline","meg","ryan","among","class","actor","alwai","interest","see","despit","review","alwai","find","m","ryan","charm","winsom","actress","nearli","role","kevin","kline","almost","alwai","worth","watchingbr","nearli","almost","larg","part","becaus","moviebr","meg","ryan","doe","plai","likeabl","charact","plai","weakwil","whiner","begin","grate","nerv","shortli","open","credit","doe","give","sever","dai","late","kevin","kline","charact","even","annoi","littl","likeabl","even","normal","like","two","actor","recommend","give","pass"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,10,14,18,22,30,38,40,41,47,60,61,128,131,132,147,150,176,197,219,242,271,298,316,355,356,391,465,487,564,611,628,700,797,826,1221,1491,2229,2535,2946,2983,4402,4535,4571],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,10,14,18,22,30,38,40,41,47,60,61,128,131,132,147,150,176,197,219,242,271,298,316,355,356,391,465,487,564,611,628,700,797,826,1221,1491,2229,2535,2946,2983,4402,4535,4571],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.852034211452262,2.247774048205673,1.1175081997259209,2.430631986809635,1.2979240167361772,2.6728839783437044,1.519311641348122,3.2569937516641474,3.1375198335242067,1.7064694353107215,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.3409902041158843,4.502423616410601,2.253494045787767,2.2844323215331563,2.332712011146513,2.5040471493269134,7.674995498441959,2.5792094178355414,2.689504733779216,2.757740698455715,2.7819920465008363,2.878207028279898,3.0316467233633775,3.028335462059722,3.109204957709252,3.2681460658591432,3.3220965805878846,3.469984576472117,7.040121828904586,3.607563812710113,3.616452760127359,3.7987743169213135,3.8204358137024927,4.470719289830655,14.039921186952597,15.34822741966276,5.170884043049248,5.373120909544144,5.408212229355414,5.9370563586240825,12.596139408322827,12.132536180208179]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9506119461623899E-4,1.9488834103030862E-4,1.9493646046718602E-4,1.9489727200317508E-4,1.949157167181521E-4,1.9488726647479054E-4,1.9494787912034496E-4,1.9485827042812375E-4,1.9488838221796718E-4,1.950897782428109E-4,1.9663775885027975E-4,1.9488870412317786E-4,1.9507327604168832E-4,1.9509359931150214E-4,1.9500497338335572E-4,1.9489803967532107E-4,1.949650921386097E-4,1.9505684337379857E-4,1.9490810142076947E-4,1.9490738881741256E-4,1.9508273764260603E-4,1.949269165479169E-4,1.949272115529122E-4,1.9505208401168588E-4,1.949081717290295E-4,1.950959311615517E-4,1.949569467443742E-4,1.9488790424509789E-4,1.9497625809236229E-4,1.9503576765685202E-4,1.9492787269599082E-4,1.9503227181974907E-4,1.95128027796267E-4,1.953091368623549E-4,1.9495660985328924E-4,1.948979214665704E-4,1.9496819317392066E-4,1.949177151705372E-4,1.9485847840320722E-4,1.9490804106090225E-4,1.9510337222585769E-4,1.9499634574500068E-4,1.9503271626469327E-4,1.9486817648792695E-4,1.9490809062107955E-4,1.9489784817751054E-4,1.9496381933204352E-4,1.9499762630200028E-4,1.949579746365815E-4,1.9492707345315972E-4,1.94898330144913E-4,1.9529764517238168E-4,1.9494737217896284E-4,1.9490804594839264E-4,1.9494632816358042E-4,1.9488810364191734E-4,0.9845966403807115,1.9491850944065595E-4,1.948986037572232E-4,1.9488799239481778E-4,1.950439074637331E-4,1.949656119499621E-4,1.9488791092651977E-4,1.9486809709422535E-4,1.94848500954

I feel so sorry for John Cusack, Joan Cusack, Ben Kingsley, Marisa Tomei and Hillary Duff for getting involved with this movie. I'll remain a fan of all of them but only time can heal my feeling over this one. The one thing I can say positively about the film is that Hillary played Yonica's character so well that I didn't even recognize Hillary; it took me a few scenes to realize that it was her. Luckily I rented it for $1 through Red Box; had I paid to see it in on the big screen, I would be really fuming!!","finished_norm":["i","want","to","see","a","action","comedi","with","a","satir","twist","a","thi","film","be","tout","but","thi","on","fail","me","miser","for","me","the","plot","be","a","bite","confus","to","follow","and","i","rapidli","lose","interest","i","feel","so","sorri","for","john","cusack","joan","cusack","ben","kingslei","marisa","tomei","and","hillari","duff","for","get","involv","with","thi","movi","i","will","remain","a","fan","of","all","of","them","but","onli","time","can","heal","my","feel","over","thi","on","the","on","thing","i","can","sai","posit","about","the","film","be","that","hillari","plai","yonica","charact","so","good","that","i","do","not","even","recogn","hillari","it","take","me","a","few","scene","to","realiz","that","it","be","her","luckili","i","rent","it","for","through","red","box","have","i","pai","to","see","it","in","on","the","big","screen","i","would","be","realli","fume"],"filtered":["want","see","action","comedi","satir","twist","thi","film","tout","thi","fail","miser","plot","bite","confus","follow","rapidli","lose","interest","feel","sorri","john","cusack","joan","cusack","ben","kingslei","marisa","tomei","hillari","duff","get","involv","thi","movi","remain","fan","onli","time","heal","feel","thi","thing","sai","posit","film","hillari","plai","yonica","charact","good","even","recogn","hillari","take","scene","realiz","luckili","rent","red","box","pai","see","big","screen","realli","fume"],"filtered2":["want","see","action","comedi","satir","twist","tout","fail","miser","plot","bite","confus","follow","rapidli","lose","interest","feel","sorri","john","cusack","joan","cusack","ben","kingslei","marisa","tomei","hillari","duff","get","involv","remain","fan","onli","time","heal","feel","thing","posit","hillari","plai","yonica","charact","good","even","recogn","hillari","take","scene","realiz","luckili","rent","red","box","pai","see","big","screen","realli","fume"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,8,10,11,13,19,29,31,32,37,40,43,60,82,127,129,140,154,192,215,221,241,260,291,322,405,427,435,437,509,654,661,682,779,854,1278,1330,1568,1935,2779,2912,3839,4123,5904,7049,7170],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,8,10,11,13,19,29,31,32,37,40,43,60,82,127,129,140,154,192,215,221,241,260,291,322,405,427,435,437,509,654,661,682,779,854,1278,1330,1568,1935,2779,2912,3839,4123,5904,7049,7170],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,3.321622407243643,1.838176641236591,2.020196584395323,2.4359679371086367,2.4106958340079214,2.317169775997098,2.348499626138016,2.5318267134339894,2.605934685587711,2.6423424573643777,2.6627744961815836,2.6754694156628323,3.016831637578237,2.885344817328191,3.109204957709252,3.233054746047873,3.2829611516442836,3.1952392950510555,3.360519385990158,3.634471265630037,3.5727776966246974,3.6497387377608255,3.8463152616903136,4.291900363587903,4.535724120139652,4.370968887063596,4.597282013139085,5.408212229355414,11.874112717248165,5.3560264761848435,5.907203395474402,5.822646007446338,6.489124940924123,20.605843687887077,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164647E-4,2.2324275812784201E-4,2.232978784893335E-4,2.232529884730999E-4,2.2327411672029305E-4,2.232415272346221E-4,2.2331095844892388E-4,2.2320831253640837E-4,2.2324280530791677E-4,2.2347350255652796E-4,2.252466997550511E-4,2.2324317404730213E-4,2.2345459944064986E-4,2.2347787955470612E-4,2.233763593891772E-4,2.23253867834309E-4,2.2333067579913992E-4,2.2343577597443474E-4,2.232653934689037E-4,2.232645771884735E-4,2.2346543761534007E-4,2.232869460197475E-4,2.2328728394518962E-4,2.2343032416998433E-4,2.23265474006353E-4,2.234805506669638E-4,2.2332134532680097E-4,2.2324225779449914E-4,2.2334346629394162E-4,2.2341163393927864E-4,2.2328804127835593E-4,2.2340762949082008E-4,2.2351731705956882E-4,2.2372477578809857E-4,2.2332095942123782E-4,2.2325373242729904E-4,2.2333422800586617E-4,2.2327640592866783E-4,2.232085507699066E-4,2.2326532432724458E-4,2.234890743360057E-4,2.2336647651074372E-4,2.2340813859831544E-4,2.2321965983456354E-4,2.2326538109796064E-4,2.232536484753716E-4,2.2332921781121265E-4,2.2336794337671947E-4,2.2332252276763815E-4,2.2328712575322453E-4,2.232542005644893E-4,2.237116121655257E-4,2.2331037775234777E-4,2.2326532992581876E-4,2.2330918184256546E-4,2.232424862016768E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.232773157576041E-4,2.2325451398481227E-4,2.232423587691726E-4,2.2342095801135574E-4,2.233312712381457E-4,2.2324226544800495E-4,2.2321956888982656E-4,2.2319712169645176E-4,2.233989272262173

{"value":"Uninspired direction leaves a decent cast stranded in a handsome but bland adaptation, in which dialogue seems recited rather than heartfelt, and cash strapped appearances by the ghosts fail to round up any sense of awe or magic; Edward Woodward, as the Ghost of Christmas Present, wobbles around on stilts and seems to be doing an impression of Bernard Cribbins. As Scrooge, George C. Scott is too wry, and he never seems to truly believe in it, which robs his performance of its effect. The scenes in which he's shown his past have as much impact as if he was half-heartedly flicking through his family album.

{"value":"...from this awful movie! There are so many things wrong with this film, acting, writing, direction, editing, etc. that it's amazing that something rises to the top and proves itself to be the absolute worst. The music! I noted that the film has two composers listed. This must be the reason why every single frame has music, of the absolute worst \"D\" movie style drivel. They have never heard of the expression \"less is more\". It got so painful to listen to, I muted the sound every time there was no dialogue, not that the dialogue was that good. You have to feel sorry for Robert Wagner and Tom Bosley, I'm sure they didn't see roles like this in the twilight of their careers. See it at your own

{"value":"This really was the worst movie I have ever seen. Michael Vartan is hot, but who is this woman? And she looks absolutely awful through the whole movie, the hair is so bad! They talk in like monotone voices and there is nooo chemistry. The cover of the DVD does not even remotely come close to what the movie actually is. Really, really boring. I had to fast forward through some of it because it was so painful to watch. I really want to know how i on earth anyone could think this is good? hhaha they literally just like talk and say \"yeah\" and there is no passion whatsoever. I could not tell at all that they were in love. I'm sorry but this was the saddest excuse for a movie I think I have ever

{"value":"With movies like this you know you are going to get the usual jokes concerning ghosts. Eva as a ghost is pretty funny. And the other actors also do a good job. It is the direction and the story that is lacking. That could have been overlooked had the jokes worked better. The problem only is that there aren't many jokes. Sure I laughed a couple of times. Apart from the talking parrot there wasn't an ounce of creativity to be noticed in the movie. I blame the director not using the premise to it's full potential. Eva certainly has the comedic skill to show more but did not get the opportunity to do so. Overall this movie is ideal for a Sunday afternoon. Other than that it can be skipped completely.","finished_norm":["with","movi","like","thi","you","know","you","be","go","to","get","the","usual","joke","concern","ghost","eva","a","a","ghost","be","pretti","funni","and","the","other","actor","conjur","do","a","good","job","it","be","the","direct","and","the","stori","that","be","lack","that","can","have","be","overlook","have","the","joke","work","well","the","problem","onli","be","that","there","be","not","mani","joke","sure","i","laugh","a","coupl","of","time","apart","from","the","talk","parrot","there","be","not","a","ounc","of","creativ","to","be","notic","in","the","movi","i","blame","the","director","not","us","the","premis","to","it","full","potenti","eva","certainli","have","the","comed","skill","to","show","much","but","do","not","get","the","opportun","to","do","so","overal","thi","movi","be","ideal","for","a","sundai","afternoon","other","than","that","it","can","be","skip","complet"],"filtered":["movi","like","thi","know","go","get","usual","joke","concern","ghost","eva","ghost","pretti","funni","actor","conjur","good","job","direct","stori","lack","overlook","joke","work","well","problem","onli","mani","joke","sure","laugh","coupl","time","apart","talk","parrot","ounc","creativ","notic","movi","blame","director","us","premis","full","potenti","eva","certainli","comed","skill","show","much","get","opportun","overal","thi","movi","ideal","sundai","afternoon","skip","complet"],"filtered2":["like","know","go","get","usual","joke","concern","ghost","eva","ghost","pretti","funni","actor","conjur","good","job","direct","stori","lack","overlook","joke","work","well","problem","onli","mani","joke","sure","laugh","coupl","time","apart","talk","parrot","ounc","creativ","notic","blame","director","us","premis","full","potenti","eva","certainli","comed","skill","show","get","opportun","overal","ideal","sundai","afternoon","skip","complet"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,8,11,17,20,26,28,39,41,48,50,56,58,62,78,102,103,119,133,167,183,186,214,253,265,289,336,389,412,484,547,572,688,727,874,898,931,976,993,1125,1682,2345,2437,2730,2750,2936,5232],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,8,11,17,20,26,28,39,41,48,50,56,58,62,78,102,103,119,133,167,183,186,214,253,265,289,336,389,412,484,547,572,688,727,874,898,931,976,993,1125,1682,2345,2437,2730,2750,2936,5232],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.8610609350701788,1.865701314626681,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,2.087553710177271,2.098582041218749,2.1653408989309972,2.3212364753796515,2.4609576687888097,2.4885128563647294,2.571852579609833,8.191127420549101,2.7073305177318163,2.73529586597515,2.8282659991423613,2.9233055795674137,3.0914425013694116,3.107414446935464,3.291526514503207,3.432149042129413,3.4933926673701317,3.6016814428070463,8.19205168077849,3.872882289075035,3.892300374932137,3.9241755834625858,4.058285512406398,4.026392148630444,4.251780369798478,4.706176101378222,5.051537285416681,5.129498826886393,5.322690055917252,5.373120909544144,11.540004547921834,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805355E-4,2.1925531043720598E-4,2.1930944626706033E-4,2.1926535805328188E-4,2.19286108918556E-4,2.1925410152956966E-4,2.193222925991185E-4,2.192214800952665E-4,2.1925535677457442E-4,2.1948193342720784E-4,2.2122345877948968E-4,2.1925571892772593E-4,2.1946336794909405E-4,2.1948623224568857E-4,2.1938652538130765E-4,2.192662217077919E-4,2.1934165776813395E-4,2.194448806979818E-4,2.192775414774106E-4,2.1927673977696296E-4,2.1947401253786462E-4,2.1929870906764107E-4,2.192990409572322E-4,2.194395262708674E-4,2.1927762057634125E-4,2.194888556479086E-4,2.1933249395190825E-4,2.1925481904056077E-4,2.193542198056751E-4,2.194211698754802E-4,2.1929978476330176E-4,2.1941723695242696E-4,2.1952496533805875E-4,2.197287185451422E-4,2.1933211493919242E-4,2.1926608871935255E-4,2.1934514652716485E-4,2.1928835723826443E-4,2.1922171407356012E-4,2.1927747357072436E-4,2.194972270715441E-4,2.1937681902578187E-4,2.1941773696650525E-4,2.192326247137997E-4,2.19277529327431E-4,2.192660062669314E-4,2.1934022582203953E-4,2.1937825969134961E-4,2.1933365036190086E-4,2.192988855908109E-4,2.1926654849491634E-4,2.1971579004444685E-4,2.1932172227464693E-4,2.1927747906929967E-4,2.1932054772559202E-4,2.1925504336804653E-4,0.9826707519943642,2.192892508163027E-4,2.1926685631708617E-4,2.1925491821167637E-4,2.1943032740576226E-4,2.1934224257171348E-4,2.1925482655736357E-4,2.1923253539347096E-4,2.1921048914035573E-4,2.1940869012321295E-4,2.1926556769286487E-4,2.19365

{"value":"Normally I'm not motivated to write reviews. But this movie was so excruciatingly painful I feel I must. I cringed at the appallingly predictable plot, the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense. Indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the \"most tense\" moment of the movie. Molly Ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production. Even the \"twist\" at the end wasn't. I've heard it said that the movie didn't take itself seriously; but I could find little evidence of that in the movie.<br /><br />Cut should have been left on the cutting room floor.

{"value":"James Gandolfini is a good actor so what ever did he take a role in this piece of unfunny rubbish. Affleck is just a lightweight who just can't cut it, the rest of the cast are truly unforgettable. I saw this in the USA in an empty theatre, I soon knew why the place was empty after about 10 minutes. I walked out before the end it was so bad, so imagine my surprise when back in England I saw the movie had a glowing report from that yoyo \"Paul Ross\" in one of the down market Sundays. I always rely on Ross to save me money on cinema tickets, if he says the movie is good, I get straight on this very website to check it out. This movie should have gone straight to £1.99 DVD in a supermarket near

{"value":"This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen, (yes it's even worse than Dungeons and Dragons and any film starring Kevin Costner.)<br /><br />Chris Rock looked very uncomfortable throughout this whole film, and his supporting actors didn't even look like they were trying to act. Chris Rock is a wonderful stand-up comedian, but he just can't transfer his talent to this film, which probably only has two strained laughs in the whole picture.<br /><br />If you haven't watched this film yet, avoid it like the plague. Go do something constructive and more interesting like watching the weather channel or watching paint dry on a brick wall.<br /><br />For Chris' efforts I give it a 2/10!<br /><br

{"value":"We went to the movie with a group because the play we were going to was cancelled. It is without doubt one of the worst movies ever. It is not that i don't like cult-movies I do. But nothing happens in the film. One does not feel any connection with the characters whatsoever. endless times without dialog. And the car. How do thay carry a huge tent and beds chairs and clothing for every day in that car? It is a two seater! I have to say however the scenery is beautiful, but not in a movie, the director should have made a photoshoot of the movie, so that we could skip about 80 minutes of useless time in with nothing happens anyway.<br /><br /> I would not recommend it, as it is a waste of your

{"value":"Loaded with fine actors, I expected much more from \"Deceiver\" than was delivered. The plot is extremely contrived and manipulative. The many flashbacks only add to the confusion. Believability flies out the window and with the ending becomes unbearable and downright ridiculous. I would strongly advise anyone who likes their movie plots to be based on something that is at least possible to avoid \"Deceiver\" because you will be very frustrated. Maybe I am just not hip enough to get it, but my suspicion is that many others were totally confused by the story line and especially by the ending. Blurring the line between reality and lies simply does not work because the entire movie made no sense. -

{"value":"The only redeeming part of this movie was the price I paid. At least all I lost was $3.00 and the time elapsed sitting through this bomb. The crew member who was in charge of continuity missed the boat. When the female lead and the FBI guy went to the alleged killers location, Mr. FBI handed the female a revolver. When the alleged killer came out the door, the revolver has magically transformed into an automatic. One is left to ponder would an FBP agent hand a weapon to a civilian? I think not. Ms. Xavier appears to be a very attractive female. It is too bad the R rating did not allow much of her to be seen.

{"value":"This is the biggest pile of crap I have ever watched. DO NOT RENT! The makers of this movie should be band from ever making another movie. It starts with some what of a plot, then fades fast to nothing. I think I would rather watch paint dry then to as much as looking at the cover. The actors were awful, the plot faded fast, filming left to much work to be done. Not one good thing to say about this crap movie. If you rent this movie you will waste your money. I really enjoy National Lampoon movies, but this was a waste of time. Learn to write, learn to act, learn to produce, and learn to direct. I feel I should sue these a-holes that made this movie for money wasted on rental cost and time

{"value":"this movie is outrageous. by outrageous, i mean awful. i had more fun watching the paint dry at my local hardware store on an august day while suffering from a migraine and heat stroke. the acting got progressively worse as the \"movie\" advanced, and the directors use of euphoric drugs became apparent as the final scenes approached. when misty was shot to death she decided that it would

{"value":"Being an Elvis fan, I can't understand how this proyect could be done. Is by far the worst Elvis related movie of all time, totally unfunny, silly and plenty of mistakes about The King. Come on, Elvis' grave in a public park? A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958?...and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast tries to do their best, Mike Starr is funny (specially as an impersonator), the Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, but the guy playing the young Elvis sucks.Overall the movie lacks fun and becomes more boring minute after minute.

{"value":"This film is really terrible. terrible as in it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life. Special effects are so terrible. The acting wasn't convincing.<br /><br />Its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about \"blood surfing\". Blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a 31 foot crocodile interrupts there holiday. The sharks don't look real. The crocodile is even worse, and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature, but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females flash it. The deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in time.<br /><br />A pointless, terrible film thats not worth

{"value":"I realize it's not supposed to be BSG and I can handle slow-paced shows if they're interesting but I find myself completely uninterested and bored with this series.<br /><br />The formula for BSG seemed to be: Action + Adventure + SciFi + Suspense + Mystery + Drama<br /><br />the formula for Caprica seems to be: Bland Drama + Moderate Scifi<br /><br />Maybe it will get more interesting but as of episode 3 I can barely watch it.

{"value":"Whack!!! I got this movie because Elizabeth Hartman was in it. I was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end. Other than that I was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time. Some teenager goes on a trip to Romania with his Dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there's a full moon. He kills his father and friends. About 30 years past but he doesn't age a bit and enrolls in a high school. There he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her. This movie sucked and I don't recommend it to anyone. Read War and Peace instead. Only Ms. Hartman did a great job.

{"value":"The case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price. I expected a \"Based on the true story\" movie only to find a shot on home video hodge-podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non-related slaughter house scenes. The video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects. I started this review before I was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but, low and behold it only got worse. If I could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten.

{"value":"i like Jane Austin novels. I love Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility books and movies, and I'm half way through Mansfield Park. But i couldn't stand Emma. I gave up on the book after 2 chapters, and by the end of the movie i couldn't care less about Emma. She didn't seem to change at all. Maybe it was Paltrows acting (which as excellent in Se7en) or my lack of interest for the movie. Dunno. <br /><br />The costumes are nice, but the dancing was clumsy compared to Pride and Prejudice dancing by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.<br /><br />I gave it a 2 basically for the fact Knightly

{"value":"European Vacation (aka National Lampoon's European Vacation) is the weakest of the Vacation films (the first and third one the most superior of the films). While Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo return as Clark and Ellen Griswold (with new actors in the roles of Russ and Audrey Griswold), this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue. This causes the pacing to suffer, with the jokes not very funny at all. To be more specific, what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the \"jokes\" as they are, are just pasted together into a cobbled-together script), rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 Vacation films have. Oh well, they can't win them all. 4 out of 10.","finished_norm":["european","vacat","aka","nation","lampoon","european","vacat","be","the","weak","of","the","vacat","film","the","and","on","the","much","superior","of","the","film","while","chevi","chase","and","beverli","have","angelo","return","a","clark","and","ellen","griswold","with","new","actor","in","the","role","of","russ","and","audrei","griswold","thi","time","thei","be","give","a","weak","script","with","veri","bad","dialogu","thi","caus","the","pace","to","suffer","with","the","joke","not","veri","funni","at","all","to","be","much","specif","what","realli","caus","thi","film","to","suffer","be","the","fact","that","the","joke","a","thei","be","be","just","past","togeth","into","a","cobbledtogeth","script","rather","than","serv","a","central","plot","a","the","other","vacat","film","have","oh","good","thei","ca","not","win","them","all","out","of"],"filtered":["european","vacat","aka","nation","lampoon","european","vacat","weak","vacat","film","much","superior","film","chevi","chase","beverli","angelo","return","clark","ellen","griswold","new","actor","role","russ","audrei","griswold","thi","time","thei","give","weak","script","veri","bad","dialogu","thi","caus","pace","suffer","joke","veri","funni","much","specif","realli","caus","thi","film","suffer","fact","joke","thei","past","togeth","cobbledtogeth","script","rather","serv","central","plot","vacat","film","oh","good","thei","ca","win"],"filtered2":["european","vacat","aka","nation","lampoon","european","vacat","weak","vacat","superior","chevi","chase","beverli","angelo","return","clark","ellen","griswold","new","actor","role","russ","audrei","griswold","time","give","weak","script","veri","bad","dialogu","caus","pace","suffer","joke","veri","funni","specif","realli","caus","suffer","fact","joke","past","togeth","cobbledtogeth","script","rather","serv","central","plot","vacat","oh","good","ca","win"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,9,13,15,30,32,41,62,77,81,87,97,128,160,214,234,248,270,379,440,452,488,489,530,546,633,815,1055,1263,1406,1641,1662,1714,1773,2344,2881,3324,3788,4181,5183,5506,7051],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,9,13,15,30,32,41,62,77,81,87,97,128,160,214,234,248,270,379,440,452,488,489,530,546,633,815,1055,1263,1406,1641,1662,1714,1773,2344,2881,3324,3788,4181,5183,5506,7051],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,2.4001215597131385,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.5687599167621034,2.0226120445069267,3.8927804517536475,1.949757232424728,2.115024371522662,2.0545557924622586,2.3409902041158843,2.3722295531801256,5.460751613699401,2.673149229007135,2.689504733779216,2.731603554088023,6.254577266285095,3.212973749990824,6.5744693248433315,3.3933092088131493,3.3956930001684253,3.5784919978881358,3.4572130107926293,7.100483063204568,3.7881170224473255,4.246178114249808,4.390138803171316,9.325758591249796,4.6295428753573065,4.688631791727313,4.724033718778229,5.02684467282631,21.098723346923567,5.719991853386255,5.999576715605417,5.7959777603641776,6.101359409915359,6.489124940924123,6.389041482367141,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125573E-4,2.273779263270829E-4,2.274340676935462E-4,2.2738834617097773E-4,2.2740986578072451E-4,2.27376672633793E-4,2.2744738993572345E-4,2.2734284269338754E-4,2.2737797438108319E-4,2.27612944878843E-4,2.2941898734736641E-4,2.2737834995069852E-4,2.2759369161694316E-4,2.2761740295299345E-4,2.2751400231007035E-4,2.273892418207623E-4,2.2746747251417926E-4,2.2757451948007216E-4,2.2740098094688546E-4,2.2740014954633714E-4,2.2760473054921087E-4,2.2742293271974033E-4,2.274232769046399E-4,2.2756896669080782E-4,2.2740106297614528E-4,2.276201235427731E-4,2.274579692117211E-4,2.2737741672597004E-4,2.2748049992975635E-4,2.2754993025739302E-4,2.2742404826603293E-4,2.275458516337717E-4,2.2765757096628264E-4,2.278688724924201E-4,2.2745757615795557E-4,2.2738910390558245E-4,2.2747109051910838E-4,2.2741219739254277E-4,2.2734308533973034E-4,2.274009105245022E-4,2.276288050973628E-4,2.275039363691942E-4,2.2754637017156231E-4,2.2735440017971131E-4,2.2740096834679308E-4,2.2738901839859744E-4,2.2746598751966345E-4,2.2750543040620826E-4,2.2745916846251952E-4,2.2742311578245487E-4,2.273895807141672E-4,2.2785546503755497E-4,2.274467984827939E-4,2.2740091622677983E-4,2.2744558042094652E-4,2.2737764936397745E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441398E-4,2.273898999400346E-4,2.2737751957101665E-4,2.2755942704103609E-4,2.2746807898261533E-4,2.273774245212432E-4,2.273543075503876E-4,2.2733144456336745E-4,2.275369881754615E-4,2.273885635769487E-4,2.274919259604514E-4,2.2755868907355317E-4,2.2745545012449884E-4,2.274012174117603E-4,2.2735460559673468E-4,2.2741276710551376E-4,2.2735448314072828E-4,2.273664143363154E-4,2.27354

{"value":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I saw it at the premiere at SXSW and was extremely disappointed. The director knew little about John Lennon and even said as much at the premiere. This is a drama, but people were laughing throughout at how cheesy the film was. That's never a good sign. The only saving graces were Dominic Monaghan and Jason Leonard as Livien's roommates/bandmates. They were funny while the rest of the movie took itself waaay too seriously. The cheesy dropping of Beatles lyrics was just absurd. The soundtrack was excellent, however, and was probably the best part of the movie. Unless you're one of those crazy, rabid Dominic Monaghan fans, don't bother with this one.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","i","see","it","at","the","premier","at","sxsw","and","be","extrem","disappoint","the","director","know","littl","about","john","lennon","and","even","sai","a","much","at","the","premier","thi","be","a","drama","but","peopl","be","laugh","throughout","at","how","cheesi","the","film","be","that","never","a","good","sign","the","onli","save","grace","be","domin","monaghan","and","jason","leonard","a","livien","roommatesbandm","thei","be","funni","while","the","rest","of","the","movi","take","itself","waaai","too","serious","the","cheesi","drop","of","beatl","lyric","be","just","absurd","the","soundtrack","be","excel","howev","and","be","probabl","the","well","part","of","the","movi","unless","you","re","on","of","that","crazi","rabid","domin","monaghan","fan","do","not","bother","with","thi","on"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","movi","ever","see","see","premier","sxsw","extrem","disappoint","director","know","littl","john","lennon","even","sai","much","premier","thi","drama","peopl","laugh","throughout","cheesi","film","never","good","sign","onli","save","grace","domin","monaghan","jason","leonard","livien","roommatesbandm","thei","funni","rest","movi","take","waaai","serious","cheesi","drop","beatl","lyric","absurd","soundtrack","excel","howev","probabl","well","part","movi","unless","re","crazi","rabid","domin","monaghan","fan","bother","thi"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","see","see","premier","sxsw","extrem","disappoint","director","know","littl","john","lennon","even","premier","drama","peopl","laugh","throughout","cheesi","never","good","sign","onli","save","grace","domin","monaghan","jason","leonard","livien","roommatesbandm","funni","rest","take","waaai","serious","cheesi","drop","beatl","lyric","absurd","soundtrack","excel","howev","probabl","well","part","unless","re","crazi","rabid","domin","monaghan","fan","bother"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,11,14,20,23,25,26,31,42,44,58,61,62,68,113,133,140,148,187,189,226,291,329,371,438,460,463,496,543,580,712,796,876,904,928,1149,1339,2265,2545,2852,2962,5947,6742],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,11,14,20,23,25,26,31,42,44,58,61,62,68,113,133,140,148,187,189,226,291,329,371,438,460,463,496,543,580,712,796,876,904,928,1149,1339,2265,2545,2852,2962,5947,6742],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.865701314626681,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,2.1521782565202803,2.3212364753796515,2.317169775997098,2.3018654096236517,2.4732161909892554,2.498193474075453,2.5940874818617203,3.016831637578237,2.951986790814132,3.0466846007279185,3.1797351085150902,3.216957819005698,3.3467891931782563,3.293679367864308,6.955453101251464,3.5039747767006686,3.7165362186843414,3.850067611308864,3.8844878351953436,3.9121030022283168,4.017463517886143,4.297765483040301,4.506310234933358,10.286208957884345,5.7446844659766265,10.746241819088288,5.463272006538442,6.543192162194399,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.45790924888157E-4,2.45573117123575E-4,2.4563375102320054E-4,2.4558437078212725E-4,2.456076124297672E-4,2.455717631074923E-4,2.4564813933516814E-4,2.4553522603438377E-4,2.4557316902294285E-4,2.4582694228272693E-4,2.4777750751927874E-4,2.455735746463146E-4,2.4580614834016654E-4,2.458317570999925E-4,2.457200821515691E-4,2.4558533810341916E-4,2.456698289576875E-4,2.457854420144058E-4,2.455980166155374E-4,2.4559711868482126E-4,2.458180706276572E-4,2.4562172500875503E-4,2.456220967359496E-4,2.4577944488095315E-4,2.4559810520892624E-4,2.458346953962616E-4,2.456595651838669E-4,2.455725667432642E-4,2.456838988504999E-4,2.4575888511788334E-4,2.456229298230692E-4,2.45754480115461E-4,2.458751394299813E-4,2.4610334968444504E-4,2.456591406772318E-4,2.4558518915201847E-4,2.4567373648188114E-4,2.456101306213585E-4,2.455354880977235E-4,2.4559794055782836E-4,2.4584407166447074E-4,2.4570921071599184E-4,2.4575504014757863E-4,2.455477083715591E-4,2.45598003007163E-4,2.455850968026107E-4,2.456682251312385E-4,2.457108243085361E-4,2.456608604008721E-4,2.456219227204774E-4,2.455857041156841E-4,2.4608886934091695E-4,2.4564750055311094E-4,2.455979467164125E-4,2.4564618501976283E-4,2.4557281799738353E-4,0.9805906755843552,2.4561113145798053E-4,2.455860488865798E-4,2.455726778181565E-4,2.4576914185124154E-4,2.456704839568191E-4,2.455725751623291E-4,2.455476083298702E-4,2.455229158054902E-4,2.4574490738726835E-4,2.455846055853152E-4,2.4569623921273057E-4,2.457683448302728E-4,2.456568445147524E-4,2.4559827200275704E-4,2.4554793022642224E-4,2.456107459

{"value":"Director F.W. Murnau wisely stuck with the silent film medium he knew so well to cover this story of native islander life in the South Seas. The documentary style works very well for the first half of the movie. The landscapes are beautiful, and the daily life activities of the islanders are interesting to watch. The film loses momentum, though, when it begins to concentrate more on the narrative story of two doomed lovers. The storyline just never gets that interesting, despite being handled well by Murnau. Won an Academy Award for best cinematography, although the award probably should have been for best scenery. You can't really credit the DP for getting to shoot in such a beautiful location.","finished_norm":["director","fw","murnau","wise","stick","with","the","silent","film","medium","he","know","so","good","to","cover","thi","stori","of","nativ","island","life","in","the","south","sea","the","documentari","styl","work","veri","good","for","the","half","of","the","movi","the","landscap","be","beauti","and","the","daili","life","activ","of","the","island","be","interest","to","watch","the","film","lose","momentum","though","when","it","begin","to","concentr","much","on","the","narr","stori","of","two","doom","lover","the","storylin","just","never","get","that","interest","despit","be","handl","good","by","murnau","win","a","academi","award","for","well","cinematographi","although","the","award","probabl","should","have","be","for","well","sceneri","you","ca","not","realli","credit","the","dp","for","get","to","shoot","in","such","a","beauti","locat"],"filtered":["director","fw","murnau","wise","stick","silent","film","medium","know","good","cover","thi","stori","nativ","island","life","south","sea","documentari","styl","work","veri","good","half","movi","landscap","beauti","daili","life","activ","island","interest","watch","film","lose","momentum","though","begin","concentr","much","narr","stori","two","doom","lover","storylin","never","get","interest","despit","handl","good","murnau","win","academi","award","well","cinematographi","although","award","probabl","well","sceneri","ca","realli","credit","dp","get","shoot","beauti","locat"],"filtered2":["director","fw","murnau","wise","stick","silent","medium","know","good","cover","stori","nativ","island","life","south","sea","documentari","styl","work","veri","good","half","landscap","beauti","daili","life","activ","island","interest","watch","lose","momentum","though","begin","concentr","narr","stori","two","doom","lover","storylin","never","get","interest","despit","handl","good","murnau","win","academi","award","well","cinematographi","although","award","probabl","well","sceneri","ca","realli","credit","dp","get","shoot","beauti","locat"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,13,15,17,20,26,42,47,48,58,60,75,81,86,117,147,148,206,221,237,325,356,380,391,416,489,491,515,624,629,719,775,945,954,1004,1138,1198,1225,1245,1299,1365,1598,1635,1700,1880,2072,2507,2630,2751,5647],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,13,15,17,20,26,42,47,48,58,60,75,81,86,117,147,148,206,221,237,325,356,380,391,416,489,491,515,624,629,719,775,945,954,1004,1138,1198,1225,1245,1299,1365,1598,1635,1700,1880,2072,2507,2630,2751,5647],"values":[2.0358433949768115,1.5932680941439847,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,2.330690080046114,1.3324924169710188,1.6219954307453837,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,1.865701314626681,3.676353282473182,3.948450049740535,1.949757232424728,2.031112399272319,2.2797301185117202,2.2844323215331563,2.3018654096236517,2.597304642813496,2.6423424573643777,2.640097787510554,5.947318931426056,3.028335462059722,3.102062070196872,3.109204957709252,3.1401446412440817,3.3956930001684253,3.369778711402955,3.3956930001684253,3.9241755834625858,3.488143311483988,8.144543508762276,3.753391311073496,3.9782428047328615,4.062925891962901,8.352137096125563,4.224077767249142,4.34596758485818,4.470719289830655,4.409683399244287,4.5432147918688095,4.724033718778229,4.751432692966343,4.654440426979034,4.733083554298147,4.933754249760298,5.039114765418124,5.156897801074508,5.322690055917252,5.3560264761848435,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9506119461623863E-4,1.9488834103030826E-4,1.9493646046718567E-4,1.9489727200317473E-4,1.9491571671815175E-4,1.9488726647479018E-4,1.949478791203446E-4,1.948582704281234E-4,1.9488838221796683E-4,1.9508977824281054E-4,1.966377588502794E-4,1.948887041231775E-4,1.9507327604168797E-4,1.950935993115018E-4,1.9500497338335537E-4,1.9489803967532072E-4,1.9496509213860934E-4,1.9505684337379822E-4,1.9490810142076915E-4,1.949073888174122E-4,1.9508273764260568E-4,1.9492691654791655E-4,1.9492721155291184E-4,1.9505208401168552E-4,1.9490817172902915E-4,1.9509593116155135E-4,1.9495694674437385E-4,1.9488790424509753E-4,1.9497625809236193E-4,1.9503576765685167E-4,1.9492787269599046E-4,1.9503227181974872E-4,1.9512802779626665E-4,1.9530913686235455E-4,1.949566098532889E-4,1.9489792146657004E-4,1.949681931739203E-4,1.9491771517053685E-4,1.9485847840320687E-4,1.949080410609019E-4,1.9510337222585733E-4,1.9499634574500033E-4,1.9503271626469291E-4,1.948681764879266E-4,1.949080906210792E-4,1.948978481775102E-4,1.9496381933204317E-4,1.9499762630199993E-4,1.9495797463658116E-4,1.9492707345315937E-4,1.9489833014491265E-4,1.9529764517238132E-4,1.9494737217896248E-4,1.949080459483923E-4,1.9494632816358006E-4,1.9488810364191698E-4,0

{"value":"What did the director think? Everybody who has read the biography of Artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in Renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that Tassi was guilty. That fact shows the real independence and emancipation - in her most terrible hour she stands her MAN. Why do movies depicting Renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic, are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the Hollywood happy-happy-mood won? While I would always defend a director's freedom to create his own reality in a movie I cannot make sense of turning Artimisia's life story on its head. Very disappointing choice by the makers of this
