{"value":"I do not recommend this movie , because it's inaccurate and misleading, this story was supposed to be in Algerian Berber territory, this one was shot in the southern Tunisian desert, (completetly different culture, I know I am from both Tunisia and Algeria), the other shocking element was the character of her companion aunt, speaks in the movie with a very eloquent french, university level academic french while the character she plays was supposed to be of a disturbed never left her mountain kind of personage, so living as a Bedouin with that kind of education i that context is impossible, The most disgraceful scene and disrespectful especially for the people of the region is the \"femme repudiee\" segment which is s pure invention from the writer/director, things

{"value":"Kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film I've ever seen. Sort of like a high school film project. What was Rosanna Arquette thinking?? And what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed Midwest town? Pretty hard to get involved with this one. No lessons to be learned from it, no brilliant insights, just stilted and quite ridiculous (but lots of skin, if that intrigues you) videotaped nonsense....What was with the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. And what was with that absurd dance, with everybody playing their stereotyped roles?

{"value":"This is without a shadow of a doubt the absolute worst movie Steven Seagal has ever made. And that says a lot. Don't get fooled by the rating, it's way too good. This abomination hadn't even been worthy of a 0/10 rating, if such a thing existed. <br /><br />- Absolutely no plot <br /><br />- Worst action scenes ever, and there aren't too many of them either <br /><br />- Seagal doesn't do anything himself, including the fighting, talking (lots of dubbing), and so on. As always. <br /><br />- Seagal is fat, lazy and couldn't care less about this movie. Something which is very obvious all the way through<br /><br />Take all the other garbage DTV movies Seagal has made, multiply them with each other, multiply this with a thousand billions, and all the

{"value":"Well, you know the rest! This has to be the worst movie I've seen in a long long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some bills to pay when taking on this role.<br /><br />The lead role is played by (to me) a complete unknown and I would imagine disappeared right back into obscurity right after this turkey.<br /><br />Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. This movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts, however, even this can't disguise the fact that the lady doesn't know how to throw a punch. An average 8 year old boy would take her apart on this showing.<br /><br />Sorry, the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the golden raspberry for its year.","finished_norm":["good","you","know","the","rest","thi","have","to","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","see","in","a","long","long","time","i","can","onli","imagin","that","stephani","beaham","have","some","bill","to","pai","when","take","on","thi","rolebr","br","the","lead","role","be","plai","by","to","me","a","complet","unknown","and","i","would","imagin","disappear","right","back","into","obscur","right","after","thi","turkeybr","br","bruce","lee","lead","the","martial","art","charg","in","the","earli","and","sinc","then","fight","scene","have","to","be","either","martial","art","base","or","at","littl","brutal","if","us","street","fight","techniqu","thi","movi","us","fast","cut","to","show","off","the","martial","art","howev","even","thi","ca","not","disguis","the","fact","that","the","ladi","doe","not","know","how","to","throw","a","punch","a","averag","year","old","boi","would","take","her","apart","on","thi","showingbr","br","sorri","the","onli","mysteri","on","show","here","be","how","thi","do","not","win","the","golden","raspberri","for","it","year"],"filtered":["good","know","rest","thi","wrong","movi","see","long","long","time","onli","imagin","stephani","beaham","bill","pai","take","thi","rolebr","br","lead","role","plai","complet","unknown","imagin","disappear","right","back","obscur","right","thi","turkeybr","br","bruce","lee","lead","martial","art","charg","earli","sinc","fight","scene","either","martial","art","base","littl","brutal","us","street","fight","techniqu","thi","movi","us","fast","cut","show","martial","art","howev","even","thi","ca","disguis","fact","ladi","doe","know","throw","punch","averag","year","old","boi","take","apart","thi","showingbr","br","sorri","onli","mysteri","show","thi","win","golden","raspberri","year"],"filtered2":["good","know","rest","wrong","see","long","long","time","onli","imagin","stephani","beaham","bill","pai","take","rolebr","lead","role","plai","complet","unknown","imagin","disappear","right","back","obscur","right","turkeybr","bruce","lee","lead","martial","art","charg","earli","sinc","fight","scene","either","martial","art","base","littl","brutal","us","street","fight","techniqu","us","fast","cut","show","martial","art","howev","even","ca","disguis","fact","ladi","doe","know","throw","punch","averag","year","old","boi","take","apart","showingbr","sorri","onli","mysteri","show","win","golden","raspberri","year"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,8,11,14,18,19,25,26,28,31,40,56,57,63,67,81,97,99,103,113,121,128,157,162,207,226,232,266,282,303,310,322,334,340,382,403,437,472,489,542,570,572,643,664,722,1191,1203,1335,1386,1511,1522,1542,1797,2085,2266,2276,4563,5162],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,8,11,14,18,19,25,26,28,31,40,56,57,63,67,81,97,99,103,113,121,128,157,162,207,226,232,266,282,303,310,322,334,340,382,403,437,472,489,542,570,572,643,664,722,1191,1203,1335,1386,1511,1522,1542,1797,2085,2266,2276,4563,5162],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.982619630677639,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,3.0904588387038183,2.814133962290301,1.6284968758320737,3.7221218701403576,3.668325173349496,1.8729627573220065,1.9570915389266579,1.949757232424728,2.0545557924622586,4.112860414513218,2.098582041218749,2.1521782565202803,4.438119011878839,2.3409902041158843,4.672030138951541,2.3586007221245198,2.5531798379045583,2.5940874818617203,5.675566812258503,2.747702973022204,2.918851229218033,2.868298950055202,2.854312708080462,2.885344817328191,2.942840385588056,5.897857368910622,9.705255610794765,3.189397019426827,3.1952392950510555,3.4222967456864013,3.3956930001684253,3.4471119148061256,3.944626193933877,3.4933926673701317,3.5813614403160887,3.6905607322810807,3.850067611308864,4.3215761317340196,4.3521595551061,4.933754249760298,14.145195146386406,4.566029469634981,4.550761997504193,4.597282013139085,4.798834931860927,4.944927550358424,5.089758498236879,5.064116067623542,6.2980697041614135,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.8468544965563903E-5,5.807427789803113E-5,5.852575003201027E-5,5.818758762482962E-5,5.818854096294094E-5,5.810720501096707E-5,5.828002398024255E-5,5.808264021457975E-5,5.82132311634158E-5,6.458440224072955E-5,0.5908703151763235,5.7988882027465755E-5,5.907121575399148E-5,5.9913879626796526E-5,5.803116691530598E-5,5.7870793808043034E-5,5.9314308369161317E-5,5.828548437857343E-5,5.8104653890343196E-5,5.8152812317586746E-5,5.871547488406957E-5,5.834323054459561E-5,5.8409663163613734E-5,5.8472593024496485E-5,5.892134013584635E-5,5.861319811456259E-5,6.107718561458849E-5,5.8006121590394566E-5,5.800767338999034E-5,

{"value":"To be completely honest,I haven't seen that many western films but I've seen enough to know what a good one is.This by far the worst western on the planet today.First off there black people in the wild west? Come on! Who ever thought that this could be a cool off the wall movie that everyone would love were slightly, no no, completely retarded!Secondly in that day and age women especially black women were not prone to be carrying and or using guns.Thirdly whats with the Asian chick speaking perfect English? If the setting is western,Asia isn't where your going. Finally,the evil gay chick was too much the movie was just crap from the beginning.Now don't get me wrong I'm not racist or white either so don't get ticked after reading this but this movie,this

{"value":"There's plenty to appreciate here: spectacular locations and flying sequences; period costumes, props and sets; and competent writing and acting. However, to enjoy a drama, we need at least one principal who exhibits some qualities that we can like or admire. In this bunch of catty snobs, we found only one character who is at all likable  a hapless enlisted man in a fleeting peripheral role as their helpless victim. From the reviews here, it is clear that we are completely out of step, but we did not find their malicious-schoolgirl behavior amusing or entertaining. Even the dog is detestable. We threw in the towel after two of the six episodes, so you should discount these observations accordingly, but what I could find written about this mini-series gave us no cause to expect character

{"value":"This is 30 minute show about one joke. The joke, Cavemen are not treated fairly. HaHaHa!!! He can't dial a phone because he is a Caveman. Cavemen are not as smart as human beings. Oh jeez, those Cavemen are so unsophisticated. There is no humor in this show. They can only run off this one joke for so long and they already have with the Geico commercials. This show does not deserve a time slot on national T.V. <br /><br />This show tries to hard to be funny, but it just isn't. Watching this show, I was thinking that it was trying to be like a \"Bachelor's Gone Wild Show.\" Meaning they go to the bar and try to sleep with many women. The crying caveman is annoying. The caveman with the glasses is too smart to be a caveman(HAHAHA!!!).

{"value":"The basic plot in this movie isn't bad. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored. But, despite good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is a mess. The blame for this I place on either Joan Crawford or the director or both, as her performance is just awful. Instead of being a real person, she does a wonderful impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she stares off into space and has a \"golly I am SOOOO stunned\" expression. After just a few minutes it really became annoying for me. Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I dislike for her performance, as she had done more than her share of overacting--in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films, such as BERSERK! My advice is to try a different Crawford film--there certainly were better.","finished_norm":["the","basic","plot","in","thi","movi","be","not","bad","a","ladi","make","it","big","and","come","back","to","her","alma","mater","to","be","ador","but","despit","good","act","by","robert","young","and","ev","arden","the","movi","be","a","mess","the","blame","for","thi","i","place","on","either","joan","crawford","or","the","director","or","both","a","her","perform","be","just","aw","instead","of","be","a","real","person","she","doe","a","wonder","imperson","of","a","deer","catch","in","the","headlight","in","other","word","she","stare","off","into","space","and","have","a","golli","i","be","soooo","stun","express","after","just","a","few","minut","it","realli","becom","annoi","for","me","now","thi","be","certainli","not","the","onli","crawford","film","i","dislik","for","her","perform","a","she","have","do","much","than","her","share","of","overactingin","film","such","a","johnni","guitar","or","mani","of","her","late","film","such","a","berserk","my","advic","be","to","try","a","differ","crawford","filmther","certainli","be","well"],"filtered":["basic","plot","thi","movi","bad","ladi","make","big","come","back","alma","mater","ador","despit","good","act","robert","young","ev","arden","movi","mess","blame","thi","place","either","joan","crawford","director","perform","aw","instead","real","person","doe","wonder","imperson","deer","catch","headlight","word","stare","space","golli","soooo","stun","express","minut","realli","becom","annoi","thi","certainli","onli","crawford","film","dislik","perform","much","share","overactingin","film","johnni","guitar","mani","late","film","berserk","advic","try","differ","crawford","filmther","certainli","well"],"filtered2":["basic","plot","bad","ladi","make","big","come","back","alma","mater","ador","despit","good","act","robert","young","ev","arden","mess","blame","place","either","joan","crawford","director","perform","aw","instead","real","person","doe","wonder","imperson","deer","catch","headlight","word","stare","space","golli","soooo","stun","express","minut","realli","becom","annoi","certainli","onli","crawford","dislik","perform","share","overactingin","johnni","guitar","mani","late","berserk","advic","try","differ","crawford","filmther","certainli","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,9,11,13,18,20,21,32,34,36,50,58,59,63,80,82,105,115,135,138,150,152,153,164,175,204,207,258,271,286,389,391,407,472,512,539,637,846,898,1124,1283,1515,1555,1557,1672,1935,2720,2775,2987,3976,4221,5045,5605,5685,6075],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,9,11,13,18,20,21,32,34,36,50,58,59,63,80,82,105,115,135,138,150,152,153,164,175,204,207,258,271,286,389,391,407,472,512,539,637,846,898,1124,1283,1515,1555,1557,1672,1935,2720,2775,2987,3976,4221,5045,5605,5685,6075],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.717994385570355,1.865701314626681,1.8693254449200722,1.8729627573220065,1.9951803900462557,2.020196584395323,4.353122425996981,2.201553588425805,2.366244071437088,2.2907365189289424,2.332712011146513,2.3131195476980753,2.3409902041158843,2.3930275298746078,2.3791142619576227,2.624524614047584,2.5531798379045583,2.7061321952397077,2.757740698455715,2.780700890737216,6.182885002738823,3.109204957709252,3.120015873813468,3.4222967456864013,3.369778711402955,3.6105180246075443,3.7432044657665027,3.9201351739255808,3.892300374932137,4.181290492043933,4.3773181147422555,4.605250182788262,4.589376833631972,4.573751515728891,4.9909126636002465,5.408212229355414,5.274680836730892,5.408212229355414,5.501738287366237,18.766530269227854,6.032366538428407,6.2980697041614135,6.725513718988353,6.489124940924123,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.338962639964347E-5,6.296217532954577E-5,6.345164620520453E-5,6.308502191745782E-5,6.308605549451614E-5,6.299787379593754E-5,6.318523829942563E-5,6.297124147138606E-5,6.311282377795393E-5,0.754839005011773,8.154854710708172E-5,6.286959200402605E-5,6.404302176193448E-5,6.495660953992773E-5,6.291543585466611E-5,6.274156473541838E-5,6.430657458448555E-5,6.31911582793121E-5,6.299510795691515E-5,6.304731970107195E-5,6.36573394971763E-5,0.04425421569422033,6.332578873394549E-5,6.339401516874199E-5,6.38805316666836E-5,6.354645446981282E-5,6.621782669520384E-5,6.288828255727985E-5,6.288996496611491E-5,6.304929633671282E-5,6.438939437034962E-5,6.318749689129575E-5,6.782642519119676E-5,6.336523399568745E-5,6.295673362468311E-5,6.324732045186712E-5,6.28936494043139E-5,6.293081492373126E-5,6.274124951672429E-5,6.275752749146675E-5,6.289878705873929E-5,6.356223598352815E-5,6.3

I am not sure if it was horrible writing or bad directing or both but it leaves a viewer very disappointed in having wasted the time to watch this swill. It consisted of a weak naive story line, very poor lines, and relied solely on pretty scenery, and pretty people to sell it. Unfortunately this was not enough. You would be better off to rent a tape full of static than to waste your time on this crap. Lindsey Wagner also played a pretty pathetic part as a ranch owner who apparently works very hard doing nothing, anybody who has ever been near a ranch knows that this was obviously written by a young person from los Angeles and not someone with much knowledge of the world.","finished_norm":["i","rent","thi","movi","yesterdai","and","can","hardli","express","my","disappoint","in","littl","laura","ingal","for","get","involv","in","someth","so","poorli","produc","i","be","not","sure","if","it","be","horribl","write","or","bad","direct","or","both","but","it","leav","a","viewer","veri","disappoint","in","have","wast","the","time","to","watch","thi","swill","it","consist","of","a","weak","naiv","stori","line","veri","poor","line","and","reli","sole","on","pretti","sceneri","and","pretti","peopl","to","sell","it","unfortun","thi","be","not","enough","you","would","be","well","off","to","rend","a","tape","full","of","static","than","to","wast","your","time","on","thi","crap","lindsei","wagner","conjur","plai","a","pretti","pathet","part","a","a","ranch","owner","who","appar","work","veri","hard","do","noth","anybodi","who","have","ever","be","near","a","ranch","know","that","thi","be","obvious","write","by","a","young","person","from","lo","angel","and","not","someon","with","much","knowledg","of","the","world"],"filtered":["rent","thi","movi","yesterdai","hardli","express","disappoint","littl","laura","ingal","get","involv","someth","poorli","produc","sure","horribl","write","bad","direct","leav","viewer","veri","disappoint","wast","time","watch","thi","swill","consist","weak","naiv","stori","line","veri","poor","line","reli","sole","pretti","sceneri","pretti","peopl","sell","unfortun","thi","enough","well","rend","tape","full","static","wast","time","thi","crap","lindsei","wagner","conjur","plai","pretti","pathet","part","ranch","owner","appar","work","veri","hard","noth","anybodi","ever","near","ranch","know","thi","obvious","write","young","person","lo","angel","someon","much","knowledg","world"],"filtered2":["rent","yesterdai","hardli","express","disappoint","littl","laura","ingal","get","involv","someth","poorli","produc","sure","horribl","write","bad","direct","leav","viewer","veri","disappoint","wast","time","watch","swill","consist","weak","naiv","stori","line","veri","poor","line","reli","sole","pretti","sceneri","pretti","peopl","sell","unfortun","enough","well","rend","tape","full","static","wast","time","crap","lindsei","wagner","conjur","plai","pretti","pathet","part","ranch","owner","appar","work","veri","hard","noth","anybodi","ever","near","ranch","know","obvious","write","young","person","lo","angel","someon","knowledg","world"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,8,9,14,15,17,20,23,26,39,40,44,48,49,53,61,65,74,78,89,93,102,107,119,135,139,146,153,165,171,187,227,230,241,261,279,308,313,336,341,379,398,531,555,601,661,665,828,846,861,1036,1138,1209,1403,1428,1466,1631,1778,2013,2311,2424,3130,3594,4088,6078,6639],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,8,9,14,15,17,20,23,26,39,40,44,48,49,53,61,65,74,78,89,93,102,107,119,135,139,146,153,165,171,187,227,230,241,261,279,308,313,336,341,379,398,531,555,601,661,665,828,846,861,1036,1138,1209,1403,1428,1466,1631,1778,2013,2311,2424,3130,3594,4088,6078,6639],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,3.6001823395697077,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,1.8818517047392527,3.8147700134888347,1.9486336368009016,6.019259360045842,3.9880092219144876,2.035389827120098,2.087553710177271,4.287906797278791,2.1653408989309972,2.366244071437088,2.2939035841256437,2.326138445979858,2.3409902041158843,2.448847599972298,2.373087554090762,4.946432381978511,2.6005321873043625,2.7121382192999195,2.6627744961815836,2.7085302779237206,2.7910771187233068,2.8753661172782943,2.907069060519773,2.9233055795674137,2.933776879434709,3.1272886331425473,3.143848349181566,3.424750734647968,3.432149042129413,3.506637894120152,3.5727776966246974,3.5929222627171646,3.827761853794566,3.9201351739255808,3.892300374932137,4.327618446189983,4.224077767249142,4.3095999406873045,4.550761997504193,4.449957298382227,4.499089986959872,4.646072177308517,4.828393734102471,4.933754249760298,5.214056214914456,5.604922523601468,5.463272006538442,6.342521466732247,5.822646007446338,13.086384324388797,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.5552451278822646E-5,5.517784811274662E-5,5.560680326703332E-5,5.5285506565357285E-5,5.528641235613783E-5,5.520913300000016E-5,5.5373332697057566E-5,5.5185793362332E-5,5.530987114341827E-5,0.27207013643448535,0.5384398702450223,5.5096711324721716E-5,5.6125064119299716E-5,5.6925700491660216E-5,5.513688727185634E-5,5.49845127047638E-5,5.6356032594202206E-5,5.5378520760355835E-5,5.520670911542688E-

{"value":"This is a terrible production of Bartleby, though not, as the other reviewer put it because it is \"unfilmable,\" but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book. It tells the story, almost painfully so. Watching it, I could turn the pages in my book and follow along, which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation. Rather, see the 2001 version of Bartleby featuring Crispin Glover. That version, while humorous, brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel. What's important is the spirit, not the minutiae of things like setting, character names, and costumes. The difference between these film versions is like night and day, tedious and hilarious. This version is a lesson as to what can go wrong if an adaptation is handled poorly, painful, mind-numbing schlock.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","terribl","product","of","bartlebi","though","not","a","the","other","review","put","it","becaus","it","be","unfilm","but","rather","becaus","thi","version","doe","not","maintain","the","spirit","of","the","book","it","tell","the","stori","almost","painfulli","so","watch","it","i","can","turn","the","page","in","my","book","and","follow","along","which","be","not","a","much","fun","when","deal","with","a","adapt","rather","see","the","version","of","bartlebi","featur","crispin","glover","that","version","while","humor","bring","new","detail","to","the","film","while","maintain","the","spirit","of","the","novel","what","import","be","the","spirit","not","the","minutia","of","thing","like","set","charact","name","and","costum","the","differ","between","thi","film","version","be","like","night","and","dai","tediou","and","hilari","thi","version","be","a","lesson","a","to","what","can","go","wrong","if","a","adapt","be","handl","poorli","pain","mindnumb","schlock"],"filtered":["thi","terribl","product","bartlebi","though","review","put","becaus","unfilm","rather","becaus","thi","version","doe","maintain","spirit","book","tell","stori","almost","painfulli","watch","turn","page","book","follow","along","much","fun","deal","adapt","rather","see","version","bartlebi","featur","crispin","glover","version","humor","bring","new","detail","film","maintain","spirit","novel","import","spirit","minutia","thing","like","set","charact","name","costum","differ","thi","film","version","like","night","dai","tediou","hilari","thi","version","lesson","go","wrong","adapt","handl","poorli","pain","mindnumb","schlock"],"filtered2":["terribl","product","bartlebi","though","review","put","becaus","unfilm","rather","becaus","version","doe","maintain","spirit","book","tell","stori","almost","painfulli","watch","turn","page","book","follow","along","fun","deal","adapt","rather","see","version","bartlebi","featur","crispin","glover","version","humor","bring","new","detail","maintain","spirit","novel","import","spirit","minutia","thing","like","set","charact","name","costum","differ","version","like","night","dai","tediou","hilari","version","lesson","go","wrong","adapt","handl","poorli","pain","mindnumb","schlock"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,10,17,18,22,25,29,86,87,90,96,109,131,132,143,151,159,160,166,176,190,204,210,220,250,259,260,305,324,369,398,459,468,474,600,632,701,741,776,894,945,1235,1240,1272,1338,2700,3477,3890,5674,8004],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,10,17,18,22,25,29,86,87,90,96,109,131,132,143,151,159,160,166,176,190,204,210,220,250,259,260,305,324,369,398,459,468,474,600,632,701,741,776,894,945,1235,1240,1272,1338,2700,3477,3890,5674,8004],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,2.5958480334723544,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,2.031112399272319,2.115024371522662,2.0477128419653545,2.0390708128715254,2.125691139326857,2.2512118082053005,2.253494045787767,2.3409902041158843,5.6004909736203725,2.300267965194495,4.744459106360251,2.4423870329693536,2.5040471493269134,2.558331832813986,2.624524614047584,2.687151791517189,14.168467104388633,2.6812935439488212,2.7464553122240485,2.6754694156628323,2.8612813773965557,2.8753661172782943,3.121829110937649,3.143848349181566,3.2829611516442836,3.304513710030018,3.6466665387238555,3.558633189238533,3.541919708264792,7.648184249811207,3.7165362186843414,3.770603439954617,12.273689004377257,3.9782428047328615,4.297765483040301,4.3095999406873045,4.416284083275639,4.646072177308517,10.518353300389853,5.649374286172302,6.342521466732247,6.342521466732247,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.412709085077504E-5,6.369466688547825E-5,6.418983218451769E-5,6.381894265031835E-5,6.381998825184157E-5,6.373078066193602E-5,6.392032493313335E-5,6.370383850131635E-5,6.38470679530708E-5,7.083483661981907E-5,0.8769490488097897,6.360100646083023E-5,6.478808770686863E-5,0.052617597792469155,6.364738365126215E-5,6.347148974411037E-5,6.505470665945809E-5,6.392631378508873E-5,6.372798264559895E-5,6.378080181256977E-5,6.439791847829876E-5,6.39896485856549E-5,6.406251050821068E-5,6.41315306780889E-5,6.462370722866843E-5,6.42857434328284E-5,6.6988193961782E-5,6.361991445689572E-5,6.362161643859748E-5,6.378280144406342E-5,6.513848995704157E-5,6.392260980108849E-5,6.861550662717955E-5,6.410241466961735E-5,6.368916187271936E-5,6.398312933908973E-5,6.362534374094238E-5,6.36629416378785E-5,6.347117085821401E-5,6.348763820822796E-5,6.363054116599139E-5,6.430170854606959E-5,6.397496454333501E-5,6.372202541703004E-5,6.449631484247109E-5,6.374648227859248E-5,6.586446133202818E

{"value":"I can hardly believe that this inert, turgid and badly staged film is by a filmmaker whose other works I've quite enjoyed. The experience of enduring THE LADY AND THE DUKE (and no other word but \"enduring\" will do), left me in a vile mood, a condition relieved only by reading the IMDb user comment by ali-112. For not only has Rohmer attempted (with success) to make us see the world through the genre art of 18th century France but, as ali has pointed out, has shown (at the cost of alienating his audience) the effects of both class consciousness and the revolution it inspired through the eyes of a dislikably elitist woman of her times. The director has accomplished something undeniably difficult, but I question whether it was worth the effort it took for him to do so -- or for us to watch the dull results of his labor.","finished_norm":["i","can","hardli","believ","that","thi","inert","turgid","and","badli","stage","film","be","by","a","filmmak","whose","other","work","i","have","quit","enjoi","the","experi","of","endur","the","ladi","and","the","duke","and","no","other","word","but","endur","will","do","leav","me","in","a","vile","mood","a","condit","reliev","onli","by","read","the","imdb","user","comment","by","ali","for","not","onli","have","rohmer","attempt","with","success","to","make","u","see","the","world","through","the","genr","art","of","th","centuri","franc","but","a","ali","have","point","out","have","show","at","the","cost","of","alien","hi","audienc","the","effect","of","both","class","conscious","and","the","revolut","it","inspir","through","the","ey","of","a","dislik","elitist","woman","of","her","time","the","director","have","accomplish","someth","undeni","difficult","but","i","question","whether","it","be","worth","the","effort","it","take","for","him","to","do","so","or","for","u","to","watch","the","dull","result","of","hi","labor"],"filtered":["hardli","believ","thi","inert","turgid","badli","stage","film","filmmak","whose","work","quit","enjoi","experi","endur","ladi","duke","word","endur","leav","vile","mood","condit","reliev","onli","read","imdb","user","comment","ali","onli","rohmer","attempt","success","make","u","see","world","genr","art","th","centuri","franc","ali","point","show","cost","alien","hi","audienc","effect","class","conscious","revolut","inspir","ey","dislik","elitist","woman","time","director","accomplish","someth","undeni","difficult","question","whether","worth","effort","take","u","watch","dull","result","hi","labor"],"filtered2":["hardli","believ","inert","turgid","badli","stage","filmmak","whose","work","quit","enjoi","experi","endur","ladi","duke","word","endur","leav","vile","mood","condit","reliev","onli","read","imdb","user","comment","ali","onli","rohmer","attempt","success","make","u","see","world","genr","art","th","centuri","franc","ali","point","show","cost","alien","audienc","effect","class","conscious","revolut","inspir","ey","dislik","elitist","woman","time","director","accomplish","someth","undeni","difficult","question","whether","worth","effort","take","u","watch","dull","result","labor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,11,28,31,48,53,58,66,70,74,91,106,112,120,145,165,168,177,200,219,258,280,281,323,333,367,378,382,401,447,448,467,472,532,565,592,597,598,628,665,669,803,837,853,909,1129,1163,1515,1755,1764,1980,1998,2056,2332,2465,3736,3757,3903,4315,4409,4557,4672,4769,7512,7527],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,11,28,31,48,53,58,66,70,74,91,106,112,120,145,165,168,177,200,219,258,280,281,323,333,367,378,382,401,447,448,467,472,532,565,592,597,598,628,665,669,803,837,853,909,1129,1163,1515,1755,1764,1980,1998,2056,2332,2465,3736,3757,3903,4315,4409,4557,4672,4769,7512,7527],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.982619630677639,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,1.6955116224012472,1.7003182735607676,1.865701314626681,1.929723173391612,2.094675786251684,1.9486336368009016,2.0105926690411424,2.159084361316692,4.493325799357863,2.2044500422972613,2.34599021453259,2.448847599972298,2.4894767118610357,2.458149992634611,2.5308211829319704,2.5792094178355414,2.7061321952397077,2.8028805344481915,2.832333801361687,3.0433232530252132,2.948928684455311,3.0791938792932125,3.130944944345658,3.235085203598255,3.0879275592619675,3.2070272508030975,3.2681460658591432,3.342254038012865,3.4222967456864013,3.4446025032006995,3.9081109809587793,3.509308122676031,3.4986697244709752,3.5642670069567886,3.607563812710113,3.5929222627171646,3.7099788181381825,3.7636829971100436,3.7881170224473255,3.8962296530720266,3.9612932464190886,4.197121957260614,4.2860694432771105,4.605250182788262,9.448067437556459,5.3560264761848435,4.900964426937307,4.8796870284900224,5.039114765418124,5.143104478942172,5.463272006538442,5.719991853386255,5.7959777603641776,5.770002273960917,5.967828017290836,5.9370563586240825,12.429376190444724,6.794506590475304,6.0662680901040895,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.904064458421525E-5,4.8709952053017095E-5,4.908862548289616E-5,4.880499088189734E-5,4.8805790496724656E-5,4.873756975487075E-5,4.888252211608721E-5,4.8716965967832374E-5,4.882649946676853E-5,0.29066113812677496,0.28925637579107627,4.8638326043855716E-5,4.954613627986071E-5,5.025292280096414E-5,4.867379260381675E-5,4.8539279241823895E-5,4.975003084485481E-5,4.888710203942874E-5,4.8735429995793787E-5,4.8775823002248396E-5,0.024513623714784633,4.893553678679012E-5,4.899125731

{"value":"The first \"Home Alone\" was one of the funniest movies of the 90's. The second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes! Now comes \"Home Alone 3\". I was curious how they could continue with the same story considering Kevin would've been 17 by 1997. He could take care of himself, right? So, what does the director decide to do? He takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick. The kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house? What kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots? I don't really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie. But please, I'd recommend that you'd stay away from it. It's not worth your precious time.

{"value":"I couldn't wait to receive the DVD after hearing so much about the film. What a disappointment! This became one of the most confusing films I've ever viewed. There were so many characters introduced, some resembling others, that it became impossible to follow the story line. I could not understand how George Clooney received an acting award for the film since he was hardly involved, at least in the first half of the movie. My wife and I gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the DVD. I might have considered fast forwarding to see if the ending was any better but after so much confusion decided that chances for improvement were slim. A co-worker told me that a lot of the movie \"comes together\" in the last minute or less. I was glad I didn't waste another hour, waiting.

{"value":"I can't say much about this film. I think it speaks for itself (as do the current ratings on here). I rented this about two years ago and I totally regretted it. I even /tried/ to like it by watching it twice, but I just couldn't. I can safely say that I have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever, ever again. And I'm not one to trash a movie, but I truly believe this was awful. It wasn't even funny in the slightest. The only bits I enjoyed were the few scenes with Christopher Walken in them. I think this film ruined both Jack Black and Ben Stiller for me. All I can think of when I see one of their films now-a-days is this terrible movie, and it reminds me not to waste my money. Amy Poehler is so very annoying, too.<br /><br />Overall, well, I think you get my point.

{"value":"I cannot believe that I wasted five hours of my life on this rubbish. The previous five day offering by this author was highly enjoyable and I was really looking forward to this. But most of the dialogue was completely incomprehensible. Suranne Jones was the principal culprit since she either mumbled or gabbled her lines, but most of the rest of the cast followed her example. Notable exceptions were Bernard Hill and Anne Reid, old stagers whose diction was exemplary. Do producers not listen to productions before they are aired to make sure the dialogue is audible? As a result I suppose I lost track of what was going on, and since the original plot line seemed to metamorphose into to the standard them-and-us thing between Muslims and the rest I soon lost interest. The ending was a complete anti-climax.

{"value":"As other reviewers have noted the film dies in the last 1/2 hour. However before that it suffers from predictability and a stunningly vapid performance by Kate Capshaw, who clearly never found her character and ruins every scene she's in. Connery is fine as is Fishbourne, but most scenes are manipulated for effect rather than truth which overlays the entirety with a sense of unreality. And the ending is simply bizarre. The film makers apparently knew when they pieced this mess together that all they needed were sweet potatoes and pumpkin pie to have Thanksgiving dinner, so to compensate they added an overloud \"dramatic\" score. Every little jump is accompanied by a crescendo of orchestration, to the point where it becomes laughable.

{"value":"Warning: This review contains a spoiler.<br /><br /> Wow. Almost impressively bad. Note I said, \"almost\". This is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story. The protagonists (you CANNOT call them \"heroes\") shoot innocent bystanders for their food, and also rob same for similar reasons. There's also tons of homoeroticism, which was a turnoff for me. (SPOILER: It seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim) gets killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of audience-torture.) I can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination. If you're in a MST3K mood, you might find this watchable, but for the most part you can forget it.

{"value":"If this movie as meant to discourage people from doing drugs, it fails. I was ready to start using them I got waiting for something to happen and nothing ever really did. This movie is neither horror or drama. It's just the paranoia of meth users. This movie may win an award for the using the \"F\" word so many times and so uselessly. It was not well stated, but I felt like they were making Meth to replace Meth they owed to someone. Hector just got worse and more paranoid as the movie went on and the girl just got more hopeless. The ending really made no sense. The movie made no sense unless it was just showing how annoying is is to be stuck in a house in the middle of nowhere with a meth-head.

{"value":"I guess there are some out there that remember Nicole Eggert from her little girl days on such TV shows as T.J. Hooker, Charles in Charge, and Who's the Boss? You perverts, you! Maybe you remember her from Baywatch when she grew up and got breast implants. No matter, you will certainly forget her in this supposed comedy about man-eating aliens.<br /><br />There are so many things that do not make sense and are never explained. How did she recognize the alien? Why was the alien hot for paprika and cinnamon? Why didn't the alien eat her? You get the picture.<br /><br />Before the alien eats her boyfriend and assumes his identity, you get to see her in the body of Alex Meneses. This Mexican/Ukranian beauty is the only reason to watch this trash.

{"value":"There is an awful lot wrong with this picture, beginning with a script that is both obvious and redundant. Courtney Cox plays a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. She immediately is stalked by a local who appears quite unhinged (Craig Sheffer), and who seems to be attempting a third rate Mickey Rourke imitation. D.B. Sweeny is a local cop, who is supposedly there to protect and serve. Meanwhile, the script manipulates the audience as to who's really the good guy? Logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than there should be. If you think \"Blue Desert\" might be saved by the wonderful Philip Baker Hall, you will be disappointed.

{"value":"Okay, so the introduction, with its hokey offer of a free coffin to anyone who dies of fright during the film, is so lame it's funny. And so the first \"skull scene\" is so drawn out and un-suspenseful it's funny. The actual plot of the movie is somewhat decent, there's at least a little bit of genuine food for thought in the behavior of the characters, and the plot twist is decent as horror flicks go. The acting is average, not truly bad. <br /><br />Altogether, this movie doesn't quite fall flat in the way a 1/10 movie would. It's not terrible enough to get the lowest rating or even second lowest. If I just read the screenplay, I'd say there was potential for this to be a decent movie. It's just that the horrid direction and production that ruin the movie.

{"value":"Oh, I heard so much good about this movie. Went to see it with my best friend (she's female, I'm male). Now please allow me a divergent opinion from the mainstream. After the first couple of dozen \"take off your clothes,\" we both felt a very strange combination of silliness and boredom. We laughed (at it, not with it), we dozed (and would have been better off staying in bed), we were convinced we had spent money in vain. And we had. The plot was incoherent, and the characters were a group of people about whom it was impossible to care. A waste of money, a waste of celluloid. This movie doesn't even deserve one out of ten votes, but that's the lowest available.

{"value":"They had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat. In the first Cruel Intentions, we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do. There is almost NO character development whatsoever in this prequel. It's actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me. It was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded f-words. And the end makes absolutely no sense and doesn't explain anything. The writing was just terrible. Another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the EXACT SAME lines that were in the original. Such as \"down boy\", or the kissing scene, and a few others I can't remember. I was not impressed at all by Robin's acting, but Amy did a great job.

There's no \"is\" in this movie because there's no plot or characters or themes or ideas or symbolism or discussion or dialog or point. There's nothing! <br /><br />There is a good point: it has a good soundtrack. But the sound editing is such and the movie proper is such that watching it isn't even worth your time, so if you're really interested, I'd suggest going and buying the soundtrack or something.

{"value":"Some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series. Particularly the writing. OK, the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink. I'm a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage. Nothing new or genuinely interesting. Few of them are visually creative. It's just typical fabricated Hollywood crap, uninteresting, childish, poorly conceived and in some cases, flat out laughable. Much like Tales from the Crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity! Other then that this series blows hard. I get the impression sometimes that they hired a bunch of eighth-graders to write the episodes.

{"value":"My brother is an avid DVD collector. He took one look at the cover (two models on toilets) and had to add it to his collection. I stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie (I use that term loosely) I've felt obligated to sit through. I dared not make eye contact with my brother, quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist. The biggest name in the whole movie is Michael Clark Duncan who appears in one scene, which the \"filmmaker\" decided to show every take of (about four total) throughout the movie. In fact, the whole movie pretty much follows this suit. The fact that the DVD contained deleted footage was a shock. (I went to bed without viewing it, however). To no surprise at all, I found this disc without its case behind the TV about a week

{"value":"I can sum this movie up using 20 words or less. Way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face. See, 19 words, however, I didn't completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the DVD right out from the machine and blowing it up with an M80. My advice, take the $4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this

{"value":"This movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects. There are some interesting visuals.<br /><br />Aside from that, it's typical nineties/aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance. True to the title.<br /><br />It's not worth picking apart the story. That's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur. There's not much there to begin with. It's nothing original and not very special. So don't go in for the story at all. Just look at the effects.<br /><br />As has been mentioned, it got a little flashy at the end, diluting the purity of great FX treatment of an invisible (and at times half invisible) man. However if you ignore the \"standard\" pyrotechnics, it's a sight to behold (or not to behold).<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent FX film worth seeing for that purpose and that

{"value":"What I hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written. These women have no self-respect or dignity. The entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys. Amanda Bynes' talent is completely wasted. She was brilliant on \"All That\" and her own show. Why they would write her and Jenny Garth as vapid, airhead, desperate, men chasing, \"old-maid\" wannabes is beyond me.<br /><br />Their plots and dialog remind me of \"The Simpons\", Homer says whenever his cartoon character Poochie is not on screen, \"Everyone should ask, where's Poochie?\". All the talk centers on whining about some guy, and then whining to some guy. Sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead. Then they get back together or break up at the end. The 2 women are either shallow, stupid, or sex addicts.

{"value":"Becky Harris plays the female shopper whose misfortune it is to be in the store at the wrong time and obviously ONLY purpose to be in this film is to supply a reason to wear out remote controls! Miss Harris seems to me to be in her fifties or older when she first comes on the scene. Once the red haired thug is done with her it becomes apparent that this is no AARP queen. If these are not some of the finest assets ever displayed on celluloid, I want someone to clue me in. Absolutely breathtaking in my opinion and I literally wore out my VHS copy capturing her charms. I would like to know if this movie is available on DVD.<br /><br />The rest of this movie really is not worthy of mention. I was hoping to see something fairly convincing and intelligent, however I was disappointed on both counts.
