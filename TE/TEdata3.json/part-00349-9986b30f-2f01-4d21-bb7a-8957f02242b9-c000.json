{"value":"fulci experiments with sci fi and fails. usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore, but not here. Sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for 12 minutes and if they drop they are electecuted. the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor. The city is an obvious model but not a bad one. and the end explosion is at best laughable.

{"value":"Forget Plan 9, this is the ultimate fiasco, a costume drama, ineptly directed, scripted, acted, etc. This film is based on Isabel Allende's not-so-much-better novel. I hate Meryl Streep and Antonio Banderas (in non-Spanish films), and the other actors, including Winona, my favourite actress and Jeremy Irons try hard to get over such a terrible script. Plenty of mistakes (like, for example, since when does it snow in Xmas in Chile?) and very cruel, with tons of that evil named \"magic realism\", this stands out as the worst movie of all time.

{"value":"This movie isn't very good. It's boring, and not much blood for a horror film. The plot just trods along with not much happening. And I think the female vampire was so stupid. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes. But, whenever she has one of them pinned, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them. No wonder this went straight to cable.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Not anywhere near as good as the first Vampire movie. You're a SUCKER if you waste your time on this.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","not","veri","good","it","bore","and","not","much","blood","for","a","horror","film","the","plot","just","trod","along","with","not","much","happen","and","i","think","the","femal","vampir","be","so","stupid","she","have","mani","chanc","to","kill","the","vampir","hunter","sinc","it","show","her","have","light","like","reflex","but","whenev","she","have","on","of","them","pin","she","just","take","her","time","and","someth","alwai","happen","where","she","doe","not","bite","them","no","wonder","thi","go","straight","to","cablebr","br","final","verdict","not","anywher","near","a","good","a","the","vampir","movi","you","re","a","sucker","if","you","wast","your","time","on","thi"],"filtered":["thi","movi","veri","good","bore","much","blood","horror","film","plot","trod","along","much","happen","think","femal","vampir","stupid","mani","chanc","kill","vampir","hunter","sinc","show","light","like","reflex","whenev","pin","take","time","someth","alwai","happen","doe","bite","wonder","thi","go","straight","cablebr","br","final","verdict","anywher","near","good","vampir","movi","re","sucker","wast","time","thi"],"filtered2":["veri","good","bore","blood","horror","plot","trod","along","happen","think","femal","vampir","stupid","mani","chanc","kill","vampir","hunter","sinc","show","light","like","reflex","whenev","pin","take","time","someth","alwai","happen","doe","bite","wonder","go","straight","cablebr","final","verdict","anywher","near","good","vampir","re","sucker","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,12,15,18,28,31,32,50,53,68,76,83,89,94,108,136,154,156,162,175,197,324,353,355,422,485,486,548,555,1260,1292,1498,2994,3031,4480],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,12,15,18,28,31,32,50,53,68,76,83,89,94,108,136,154,156,162,175,197,324,353,355,422,485,486,548,555,1260,1292,1498,2994,3031,4480],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,2.0064197866819473,2.1337665533324026,2.292318797740072,1.9940046109572438,4.16224563969396,2.138507503627933,2.346825985579986,2.348499626138016,2.3451551414151686,2.3586007221245198,2.3791142619576227,2.558331832813986,2.8753661172782943,3.0266839340212486,3.185521045582134,3.2090054908152035,12.48169308458045,3.3066947359763783,3.459754308221302,3.432149042129413,4.589376833631972,4.3336974922663645,4.506310234933358,5.408212229355414,5.878215858601149,5.967828017290836]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1055199807008443E-4,1.0980652010215051E-4,1.1066016109003134E-4,1.1002076550035097E-4,1.1002256806672414E-4,1.0986877850327699E-4,1.1019554364458623E-4,1.0982233152354795E-4,1.100692521598011E-4,1.2211582682756828E-4,0.3998016259060487,1.0964505406731937E-4,1.1169152462882439E-4,1.1328482877030662E-4,1.0972500609693905E-4,1.0942177352196956E-4,1.1215116278706718E-4,1.1020586813523488E-4,1.0986395485865829E-4,1.0995501254375756E-4,1.1101889178002988E-4,1.1031505426323581E-4,1.1044066468801733E-4,1.1055965211729163E-4,1.1140814064761378E-4,1.1082550743581866E-4,1.154844012309013E-4,1.0967765053656207E-4,1.0968058467056554E-4,1.0995845981158298E-4,1.1229560113332413E-4,1.1019948264625333E-4,0.20446099060523656,1.1050945752917525E-4,1.0979702972683764E-4,1.1030381539797419E-4,1.0968701035924364E-4,1.0975182731217845E-4,1.0942122377813228E-4,1.0944961269181616E-4,1.0969597046824538E-4,1.1085303051763653E-4,1.1028973968562635E-4,1.0985368488519597E-4,1.1118852234517427E-4,1.0989584732974758E-4,1.1354714061502643E-4,1.118773968151896E-4,1.0947681690395546E-4,1.0971876736428004E-4,1.0968071276208482E-4,1.127675403136376E-4,1.097203997703689E-4,1.0943989606725282E-4,1.1064115554714847E-4,1.0974866083266361E-4,0.38722452920176526,1.0965821367567458E-4,1.0947555086737283E-4,1.0999826449169096E-4,1.1108935482855013E-4,1.0999098748081434E-4,1.0945529764571615E-4,1.097101475424055E-4,1.094225472472032E-4,1.1195435819133882E-4,1.1036517112654024E-4,1.1013007715315767E-4,1.1003376342330585E-4,1.1043485398184335E-4,1.0941855533914105E-4,1.1003607022961124E-4,1.1182078224188406E-4,1.0961463946806234E-4,1.1232754468204687E-4,1.099044494385387E-4,1.1076461676936407E-4,1.100876721586893E-4,1.0938424939941218E-4,1.0951983868911666E-4]}}
{"value":"Please, even if you are in the worst of the moods, refrain from watching this flick. <br /><br />I don't think whether anything was right with this movie at all. On a friend's recommendation I watched this and I literally flushed 1h and 48 min of my life down the closet.

{"value":"I also saw this amazingly bad piece of \"anime\" at the London Sci-Fi Festival.

The animation is awful. It is badly designed and badly executed. It may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind.<br /><br />There's nothing else to say really, this film is a failure on every level.","finished_norm":["i","conjur","see","thi","amazingli","bad","piec","of","anim","at","the","london","scifi","festiv","if","you","have","to","watch","thi","thing","do","so","with","a","larg","audienc","prefer","after","a","few","beer","you","mai","then","glean","some","enjoy","from","it","br","br","i","find","the","dialogu","hilari","lodg","in","my","mind","be","the","introduct","of","cremat","the","anim","be","aw","it","be","badli","design","and","badli","execut","it","mai","have","be","a","good","idea","for","the","produc","to","have","hire","at","littl","on","person","who","be","not","colour","blindbr","br","there","noth","els","to","sai","realli","thi","film","be","a","failur","on","everi","level"],"filtered":["conjur","see","thi","amazingli","bad","piec","anim","london","scifi","festiv","watch","thi","thing","larg","audienc","prefer","beer","mai","glean","enjoy","br","br","find","dialogu","hilari","lodg","mind","introduct","cremat","anim","aw","badli","design","badli","execut","mai","good","idea","produc","hire","littl","person","colour","blindbr","br","noth","els","sai","realli","thi","film","failur","everi","level"],"filtered2":["conjur","see","amazingli","bad","piec","anim","london","scifi","festiv","watch","thing","larg","audienc","prefer","beer","mai","glean","enjoy","find","dialogu","hilari","lodg","mind","introduct","cremat","anim","aw","badli","design","badli","execut","mai","good","idea","produc","hire","littl","person","colour","blindbr","noth","els","realli","failur","everi","level"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,9,13,14,29,38,39,46,49,85,123,138,153,168,196,218,238,248,261,277,445,448,564,632,662,681,736,781,1014,1092,1217,1267,1268,2036,2235,2289,2321,8432],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,9,13,14,29,38,39,46,49,85,123,138,153,168,196,218,238,248,261,277,445,448,564,632,662,681,736,781,1014,1092,1217,1267,1268,2036,2235,2289,2321,8432],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.3195384777338066,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,3.311542587503466,1.6920303308087352,2.011190219103739,2.2619070973220485,2.2907365189289424,2.3409902041158843,2.4894767118610357,2.478925055209576,2.5940874818617203,2.597304642813496,2.689504733779216,2.7085302779237206,6.232798466686559,3.241201430615691,6.5362921317182865,3.469984576472117,3.541919708264792,3.616452760127359,3.706716172503366,3.68099128126493,3.9363956947973615,4.1302590120314875,4.550761997504193,4.477736862489302,4.327618446189983,4.30366520516749,4.979216623837056,5.039114765418124,5.089758498236879,5.214056214914456,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.68808269380329E-5,9.622753687310133E-5,9.697561421460414E-5,9.641528808255634E-5,9.641686773850008E-5,9.628209622517335E-5,9.656845266971714E-5,9.624139300964149E-5,9.64577787452761E-5,1.0701464009521002E-4,0.6262101194251307,9.608603818244057E-5,9.787943643633063E-5,9.927570810473353E-5,9.615610311912329E-5,9.589036913755409E-5,9.828223444668054E-5,9.657750040480304E-5,9.627786908602007E-5,9.635766632157875E-5,9.728998325814759E-5,9.667318426900771E-5,9.678326135524144E-5,9.688753446422693E-5,9.76310965155698E-5,9.712051336605052E-5,1.012032752461021E-4,9.611460368058281E-5,9.611717497131989E-5,9.63606872905656E-5,9.840881114064552E-5,9.657190456335526E-5,0.13663227409856057,9.684354708010524E-5,9.621922010430189E-5,9.666333523344618E-5,9.612280604125665E-5,9.617960754742162E-5,9.58898873765865E-5,9.591476563732877E-5,9.613065811796894E-5,9.714463286613145E-5,9.66510001632909E-5,9.626886912637184E-5,9.74386368303312E-5,9.630581764440133E-5,9.950558172869088E-5,9.804232314515723E-5,9.593860570005276E-5,9.615063588569828E-5,9.61172872226815E-5,9.88223889940665E-5,9.615206642385723E-5,9.590625059789778E-5,9.695895895062843E-5,9.617683264367284E-5,0.22969747570237395,9.609757043660051E-5,9.593749622511606E-5,9.63955696119364E-5,9.735173264783197E-5,9.638919249669949E-5,9.591974757383423E-5,9.61430820152496E-5,9.589104718174838E-5,9.81097672609922E-5,9.671710353998639E-5,9.651108194881611E-5,9.642667864578748E-5,9.677816921734202E-5,9.588754892426889E-5,9.642870018593468E-5,9.799270968927823E-5,9.605938473810262E-5,9.843680446025638E-5,9.631335599221633E-5,9.706715261073257E-5,9.647392087527501E-5,9.585748535357058E-5,9.59763072902142E-5]}}

{"value":"Spinal Tap was funny because if you knew a little about heavy metal, you saw in-jokes all over the place. If you know anything about porn, this mock documentary will leave you cold. Everything in it rings false.<br /><br />Spinal Tap was funny because it took a familiar world and pushed it over the top. This film is decidedly not funny because it paints a picture of how porn is made that bears no relationship to the real world.<br /><br />The acting here is uniformly awful, but that would not matter much if the core idea of the movie were good. But it's not.","finished_norm":["spinal","tap","be","funni","becaus","if","you","know","a","littl","about","heavi","metal","you","see","injok","all","over","the","place","if","you","know","anyth","about","porn","thi","mock","documentari","will","leav","you","cold","everyth","in","it","ring","falsebr","br","spinal","tap","be","funni","becaus","it","take","a","familiar","world","and","push","it","over","the","top","thi","film","be","decidedli","not","funni","becaus","it","paint","a","pictur","of","how","porn","be","make","that","bear","no","relationship","to","the","real","worldbr","br","the","act","here","be","uniformli","aw","but","that","would","not","matt","much","if","the","core","idea","of","the","movi","be","good","but","it","not"],"filtered":["spinal","tap","funni","becaus","know","littl","heavi","metal","see","injok","place","know","anyth","porn","thi","mock","documentari","leav","cold","everyth","ring","falsebr","br","spinal","tap","funni","becaus","take","familiar","world","push","top","thi","film","decidedli","funni","becaus","paint","pictur","porn","make","bear","relationship","real","worldbr","br","act","uniformli","aw","matt","much","core","idea","movi","good"],"filtered2":["spinal","tap","funni","becaus","know","littl","heavi","metal","see","injok","place","know","anyth","porn","mock","documentari","leav","cold","everyth","ring","falsebr","spinal","tap","funni","becaus","take","familiar","world","push","top","decidedli","funni","becaus","paint","pictur","porn","make","bear","relationship","real","worldbr","act","uniformli","aw","matt","core","idea","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,14,21,22,26,31,62,74,80,104,123,138,164,165,193,311,364,408,525,577,624,868,971,1084,1095,1107,1177,1257,2142,2197,2713,3091,3545,4960,5227,6230,7858],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,14,21,22,26,31,62,74,80,104,123,138,164,165,193,311,364,408,525,577,624,868,971,1084,1095,1107,1177,1257,2142,2197,2713,3091,3545,4960,5227,6230,7858],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,3.893772050208532,2.6649848339420377,1.4070669811451506,6.06783613352078,1.9486336368009016,1.9951803900462557,2.0728240170322856,2.2619070973220485,2.2907365189289424,2.3930275298746078,2.448847599972298,2.517840471459249,2.9203338091782562,2.9878441007049847,3.130944944345658,3.4149707055943286,3.604618302480356,3.9241755834625858,3.944626193933877,8.362580984087867,4.224077767249142,4.1554492608600455,4.213208095012239,4.263079925052412,4.3215761317340196,5.2288713006995975,5.039114765418124,5.426230734858092,11.16683263676101,5.626901430320244,6.101359409915359,6.1754673820690815,13.589013180950609,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.928976928679616E-5,7.875509983606043E-5,0.04765067530293163,7.890876027178862E-5,7.891005310298433E-5,7.879975261798802E-5,7.903411412314102E-5,7.876644005583559E-5,0.016189967579669687,8.75835435311264E-5,0.5587297050202921,7.863929365550366E-5,8.010705707458801E-5,8.12498018461636E-5,7.869663660808003E-5,7.847915305889687E-5,0.08190588078979985,7.904151902305985E-5,7.879629301820136E-5,7.88616011353711E-5,7.962463337961484E-5,7.911982916715171E-5,7.920991909564518E-5,7.929525889935643E-5,7.99038092737159E-5,0.2320886539945309,8.282737254569613E-5,7.866267239646662E-5,7.866477680717156E-5,7.886407357436197E-5,8.05403109959056E-5,7.903693924198877E-5,8.483945892112684E-5,7.92592584888648E-5,7.874829317781689E-5,7.911176846224185E-5,7.866938542014726E-5,7.871587323885512E-5,7.84787587732866E-5,7.84991197839928E-5,7.867581176239286E-5,7.950567486725536E-5,7.910167312245522E-5,7.878892721893381E-5,7.974629529987936E-5,7.881916683974053E-5,8.143793635313041E-5,8.024036776124232E-5,7.851863110664468E-5,7.869216208313421E-5,7.866486867658314E-5,8.087879378570314E-5,7.869333287248607E-5,7.849215085594698E-5,7.935371454251302E-5,7.87136021860061E-5,8.464782830240772E-5,7.86487319499588E-5,7.851772308372065E-5,7.889262216649412E-5,7.967517067390121E-5,7.888740297078915E-5,7.850319712941402E-5,7.868597980059154E-5,7.847970798776598E-5,8.029556576639278E-5,7.915577383208909E-5,7.898716044440157E-5,7.891808260273054E-5,0.05755750573727804,7.847684492355377E-5,7.891973708336352E-5,8.019976282841405E-5,7.861747978872478E-5,8.056322145119037E-5,7.882533641815916E-5,7.944226302645027E-5,7.895674686267803E-5,7.845224012134528E-5,7.854948706112118E-5]}}

Along the way he also gets the girl, Hannah.<br /><br />This is a nice outing for some pleasant Hollywood stars who I had not seen for a while.<br /><br />Pleasant enough to pass some spare time if

However after the great opening third I found the rest of the movie confusing and uninvolving with a large number of plotholes and isn`t all that different from umpteen other supernatural thrillers that I`ve seen","finished_norm":["the","sign","have","a","great","open","hook","a","the","isra","defenc","forc","come","across","a","terrorist","base","thi","be","the","typ","of","hook","that","be","a","must","when","write","a","script","it","grab","the","reader","audienc","and","the","introduct","of","david","bannon","a","he","rent","a","room","from","abbi","and","russel","quinnn","telegraph","the","point","that","thi","be","a","man","who","not","who","he","sai","he","be","howev","after","the","great","open","i","find","the","rest","of","the","movi","confus","and","uninvolv","with","a","larg","numb","of","plothol","and","isnt","all","that","differ","from","umpteen","other","supernatur","thriller","that","iv","see"],"filtered":["sign","great","open","hook","isra","defenc","forc","come","across","terrorist","base","thi","typ","hook","must","write","script","grab","reader","audienc","introduct","david","bannon","rent","room","abbi","russel","quinnn","telegraph","point","thi","man","sai","howev","great","open","find","rest","movi","confus","uninvolv","larg","numb","plothol","isnt","differ","umpteen","supernatur","thriller","iv","see"],"filtered2":["sign","great","open","hook","isra","defenc","forc","come","across","terrorist","base","typ","hook","must","write","script","grab","reader","audienc","introduct","david","bannon","rent","room","abbi","russel","quinnn","telegraph","point","man","howev","great","open","find","rest","confus","uninvolv","larg","numb","plothol","isnt","differ","umpteen","supernatur","thriller","iv","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,34,38,45,51,65,66,77,113,141,168,204,226,242,334,338,384,427,503,513,516,564,661,675,714,876,1550,1822,1916,1972,2180,2289,2885,3026,4211,4561,5845,7153,7348,7979],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,34,38,45,51,65,66,77,113,141,168,204,226,242,334,338,384,427,503,513,516,564,661,675,714,876,1550,1822,1916,1972,2180,2289,2885,3026,4211,4561,5845,7153,7348,7979],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.8162961064622165,3.4279798616619646,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,1.9463902258768238,2.1521782565202803,2.2657547357741192,2.4894767118610357,2.624524614047584,2.5940874818617203,5.379009467558432,2.942840385588056,2.9720957437368454,3.109204957709252,3.233054746047873,3.3490645070153917,3.454678155189441,3.442099372982581,3.469984576472117,3.5727776966246974,3.749984152751882,3.7297814454343623,3.8844878351953436,4.558366596889411,5.014723312293965,4.85885294158718,9.845408827147427,5.501738287366237,5.089758498236879,5.408212229355414,5.719991853386255,6.600350576034347,5.999576715605417,6.342521466732247,6.725513718988353,6.794506590475304,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.756903874960842E-5,7.704597258715891E-5,7.764493155690276E-5,7.719629831518783E-5,7.719756308962239E-5,7.708965632344387E-5,7.731893176261022E-5,7.7057066703778E-5,7.723031908036062E-5,0.13907249228945254,0.44907650887784056,7.693267960891149E-5,7.836858992312111E-5,0.1605930394601762,7.698877811632832E-5,7.67760143511448E-5,7.869109599022024E-5,7.732617596288861E-5,7.70862718031921E-5,7.715016261681119E-5,0.058219898729851116,7.740278663607114E-5,7.749092145115659E-5,7.757440922770715E-5,7.816975296491789E-5,7.776094716338101E-5,8.102986965804252E-5,7.695555098916628E-5,7.695760973037572E-5,7.715258139943112E-5,7.879244145546124E-5,7.732169557130012E-5,8.299829014188589E-5,7.753919009084315E-5,7.703931364563597E-5,7.739490086294901E-5,7.696211832816468E-5,7.700759727763282E-5,7.67756286222411E-5,7.679554776241085E-5,7.696840520723055E-5,7.77802587908261E-5,7.738502461018472E-5,7.707906585501057E-5,7.801565732748532E-5,7.710864922168232E-5,7.96705867287044E-5,0.055656214318049874,7.681463565428458E-5,7.698440069661791E-5,7.69576996060559E-5,7.912357856021068E-5,7.698554607773606E-5,7.678873007263205E-5,7.763159627831825E-5,7.700537551071341E-5,8.281081825209809E-5,7.694191307540921E-5,7.68137473370904E-5,0.044307918699947595,7.794607623375562E-5,7.717540450601525E-5,7.679953662210636E-5,7.697835258072068E-5,7.677655723705982E-5,7.855300763742107E-5,0.03241605863130369,7.727299706311069E-5,7.720541833478903E-5,0.0550726683249422,7.677375630648812E-5,7.720703691021792E-5,7.845928379542679E-5,7.691133914225772E-5,7.881485471267892E-5,7.711468490915787E-5,7.77182231009655E-5,7.724324351078675E-5,7.674968547272096E-5,7.684482197907747E-5]}}

{"value":"What was the purpose of this film? I suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and director a big payday for doing nothing. Even my favorite actor, Bruce Dern, couldn't keep my interest in this boring movie. A braindead ex-pugilist falls in with a weird woman and her relatives. He starts out as a fix-it man for the woman, and winds up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme. It was so confusing I can't even write a decent critique. If you see this one, my sweet, make sure it is after dark so you can go right to sleep.","finished_norm":["what","be","the","purpos","of","thi","film","i","suggest","it","be","to","make","a","hand","of","actor","and","their","produc","and","director","a","big","paydai","for","do","noth","even","my","favorit","actor","bruce","dern","can","not","keep","my","interest","in","thi","bore","movi","a","braindead","expugilist","fall","in","with","a","weird","woman","and","her","rel","he","start","out","a","a","fixit","man","for","the","woman","and","wind","up","beat","a","man","and","get","catch","up","in","a","kidnap","scheme","it","be","so","confus","i","ca","not","even","write","a","decent","critiqu","if","you","see","thi","on","my","sweet","make","sure","it","be","after","dark","so","you","can","go","right","to","sleep"],"filtered":["purpos","thi","film","suggest","make","hand","actor","produc","director","big","paydai","noth","even","favorit","actor","bruce","dern","keep","interest","thi","bore","movi","braindead","expugilist","fall","weird","woman","rel","start","fixit","man","woman","wind","beat","man","get","catch","kidnap","scheme","confus","ca","even","write","decent","critiqu","see","thi","sweet","make","sure","dark","go","right","sleep"],"filtered2":["purpos","suggest","make","hand","actor","produc","director","big","paydai","noth","even","favorit","actor","bruce","dern","keep","interest","bore","braindead","expugilist","fall","weird","woman","rel","start","fixit","man","woman","wind","beat","man","get","catch","kidnap","scheme","confus","ca","even","write","decent","critiqu","see","sweet","make","sure","dark","go","right","sleep"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,41,45,49,58,60,65,70,71,81,82,108,119,121,134,170,235,261,309,368,427,512,625,646,678,732,794,822,1009,1165,1335,1370,1388,2433,3770,5084,7916],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,41,45,49,58,60,65,70,71,81,82,108,119,121,134,170,235,261,309,368,427,512,625,646,678,732,794,822,1009,1165,1335,1370,1388,2433,3770,5084,7916],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,3.1375198335242067,3.632592212924433,1.6920303308087352,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,4.189351572503368,1.9214926742550966,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,2.138507503627933,2.1653408989309972,2.2190595059394194,2.2443961816702407,2.4071371113909277,2.6457189377809835,2.7085302779237206,2.848772527704847,3.1346146732346205,3.233054746047873,3.369778711402955,3.6194333882654965,3.5900195030592035,3.6715125373103863,3.7099788181381825,3.7465885637507435,3.813163054373413,4.096025840389245,4.246178114249808,4.933754249760298,4.520909034354511,4.443131333311827,5.143104478942172,5.7446844659766265,6.255510089742618,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.636386244750587E-5,9.571405839499034E-5,9.645814393095281E-5,9.590080774771675E-5,9.590237897447945E-5,9.576832661363032E-5,9.605315503536359E-5,9.572784059398484E-5,9.594307167657699E-5,1.0644360069924016E-4,0.6521299329374362,9.557331475360858E-5,9.735714327895754E-5,9.87459643207039E-5,9.564300581771567E-5,9.537868981570694E-5,9.775779192420821E-5,9.606215449095078E-5,9.576412203085798E-5,9.58434934614506E-5,9.677083547402926E-5,9.615732777776182E-5,9.626681748312154E-5,9.637053418175868E-5,9.711012852154091E-5,9.660226988796669E-5,1.0066324579671753E-4,9.560172782377657E-5,9.56042853938834E-5,9.584649831028506E-5,9.788369319396207E-5,9.605658850939804E-5,1.0310861064590993E-4,9.632678151813166E-5,9.570578600519015E-5,9.61475312975078E-5,9.560988641594284E-5,9.566638482434717E-5,9.537821062545762E-5,9.540295613364403E-5,9.561769659329316E-5,9.662626068430442E-5,9.613526204835612E-5,9.575517009577459E-5,9.691869581786585E-5,9.579192145330903E-5,9.897461131907752E-5,9.751916081018624E-5,9.542666898372679E-5,9.563756775792214E-5,9.560439704626201E-5,0.16827198813652808,9.563899066260548E-5,9.539448653120156E-5,9.644157754090942E-5,9.566362472772532E-5,1.0287571469036507E-4,9.558478547066067E-5,9.542556542904453E-5,9.58811944965653E-5,9.68322553636176E-5,9.587485141016809E-5,9.540791148610445E-5,9.563005419558098E-5,9.537936424179862E-5,9.75862450383728E-5,9.620101269170348E-5,9.599609044960239E-5,9.591213752991511E-5,0.17216632854792357,9.537588465132428E-5,9.591414828294886E-5,9.746981209600848E-5,9.554680353436003E-5,9.791153713879291E-5,9.579941957584665E-5,9.654919387026462E-5,9.595912767077096E-5,9.534598150244524E-5,9.546416939493502E-5]}}

This movie is like Dumb & Dumber meets the Simple Life.","finished_norm":["then","you","have","well","not","watch","thi","movi","thei","have","complet","ruin","the","premis","of","the","show","in","the","movi","the","duke","boi","be","idiot","daisi","be","trampi","rosco","be","sinist","boss","hogg","be","capabl","uncl","jessi","be","a","criminalonli","cooter","and","flash","be","true","to","the","origin","charact","at","littl","eno","be","kinda","closebr","br","at","on","point","thei","open","the","door","to","get","into","the","gener","lee","nuff","saidbr","br","the","origin","show","mai","not","have","be","great","tv","but","it","be","entertain","and","the","charact","make","sens","thi","movi","be","like","dumb","dumb","meet","the","simpl","life"],"filtered":["well","watch","thi","movi","thei","complet","ruin","premis","show","movi","duke","boi","idiot","daisi","trampi","rosco","sinist","boss","hogg","capabl","uncl","jessi","criminalonli","cooter","flash","true","origin","charact","littl","eno","kinda","closebr","br","point","thei","open","door","get","gener","lee","nuff","saidbr","br","origin","show","mai","great","tv","entertain","charact","make","sens","thi","movi","like","dumb","dumb","meet","simpl","life"],"filtered2":["well","watch","complet","ruin","premis","show","duke","boi","idiot","daisi","trampi","rosco","sinist","boss","hogg","capabl","uncl","jessi","criminalonli","cooter","flash","true","origin","charact","littl","eno","kinda","closebr","point","open","door","get","gener","lee","nuff","saidbr","origin","show","mai","great","tv","entertain","charact","make","sens","like","dumb","dumb","meet","simpl","life"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,10,14,20,28,46,51,66,69,75,103,172,173,195,225,242,282,304,350,420,484,570,706,710,737,838,1249,1397,1455,1539,1670,1764,2826,4110,6249,7345,7578,7945],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,10,14,20,28,46,51,66,69,75,103,172,173,195,225,242,282,304,350,420,484,570,706,710,737,838,1249,1397,1455,1539,1670,1764,2826,4110,6249,7345,7578,7945],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,3.0904588387038183,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,1.929723173391612,4.254065042302116,1.9742250248702675,2.098582041218749,2.5001408943598484,2.4368824319140248,2.51289241584188,2.641219492619754,2.689504733779216,2.918851229218033,2.871119826396843,3.0135689919434205,6.604674861214845,3.291526514503207,3.944626193933877,3.6590123745461547,3.6528204042982337,3.6841709341823097,3.9363956947973615,4.499089986959872,4.422928625994308,4.499089986959872,4.5432147918688095,4.9227044135737135,5.3560264761848435,5.339219357868463,6.214688095222362,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562,6.794506590475304,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.661805463885071E-5,8.603396884677282E-5,8.670280091693901E-5,8.620183120956507E-5,8.620324352951702E-5,8.608274862176234E-5,8.633877077747273E-5,8.604635717612396E-5,8.623982075467347E-5,9.567837348098563E-5,0.5345713527605892,8.590745938451546E-5,8.751087951266969E-5,0.022097699196573478,8.597010220772065E-5,8.573251793782499E-5,8.787100835520346E-5,8.63468600685822E-5,8.607896927158834E-5,8.615031343253436E-5,8.698386824316887E-5,8.64324079570518E-5,8.653082436586278E-5,8.662405162389643E-5,8.728884671727223E-5,8.68323506226319E-5,9.048261768558669E-5,8.59329988845081E-5,8.593529779347282E-5,8.615301438446711E-5,8.798417653657E-5,8.634185700537978E-5,9.268066932797137E-5,8.658472390796242E-5,8.602653308928544E-5,8.642360224876697E-5,8.594033235334262E-5,8.599111676673037E-5,8.573208721072311E-5,8.575433006946412E-5,8.594735264446926E-5,8.68539150976875E-5,8.641257385631355E-5,8.607092269497256E-5,8.711677465659054E-5,8.610395718543525E-5,8.896476410713608E-5,8.765651131919948E-5,8.577564470849937E-5,8.596521412884582E-5,8.593539815383183E-5,8.835394329266872E-5,8.596649312734668E-5,8.574671704453444E-5,8.66879099771043E-5,8.598863581387183E-5,9.247132742230066E-5,8.591777000481574E-5,8.577465276237624E-5,8.618420155445647E-5,8.703907640126002E-5,8.61784999792998E-5,8.57587842598553E-5,8.595846045441987E-5,8.57331241554939E-5,8.771681095014914E-5,8.647167477519903E-5,8.628747744736053E-5,8.62120151485291E-5,8.65262716479232E-5,8.572999647515636E-5,8.62138225430411E-5,0.43665230266580213,8.588362939079075E-5,8.800920447000339E-5,8.611069698157E-5,8.678464247473741E-5,8.62542529178003E-5,8.57031175963143E-5,8.580935249671491E-5]}}

{"value":"This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen... Unfortunately, I am a horror movie buff and will rent any horror movie unless it's not made for t.v. When looking at the box it says it is rated R for gore and some language... Where was the gore? Was their one good death scene where you actually saw gore? I could have overlooked that if there had been some brief nudity or some good dialogue. There wasn't even one remotely witty or amusing line in this lame movie. Sometimes horror movies are awesome because they are so stupid, but this was just sad.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","horror","movi","i","have","ever","see","unfortun","i","be","a","horror","movi","buff","and","will","rend","ani","horror","movi","unless","it","not","make","for","tv","when","look","at","the","box","it","sai","it","be","rate","r","for","gore","and","some","languag","where","be","the","gore","be","their","on","good","death","scene","where","you","actual","see","gore","i","can","have","overlook","that","if","there","have","be","some","brief","nuditi","or","some","good","dialogu","there","be","not","even","on","remot","witti","or","amus","line","in","thi","lame","movi","sometim","horror","movi","be","awesom","becaus","thei","be","so","stupid","but","thi","be","just","sad"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","horror","movi","ever","see","unfortun","horror","movi","buff","rend","ani","horror","movi","unless","make","tv","look","box","sai","rate","r","gore","languag","gore","good","death","scene","actual","see","gore","overlook","brief","nuditi","good","dialogu","even","remot","witti","amus","line","thi","lame","movi","sometim","horror","movi","awesom","becaus","thei","stupid","thi","sad"],"filtered2":["wrong","horror","ever","see","unfortun","horror","buff","rend","ani","horror","unless","make","tv","look","box","rate","r","gore","languag","gore","good","death","scene","actual","see","gore","overlook","brief","nuditi","good","dialogu","even","remot","witti","amus","line","lame","sometim","horror","awesom","becaus","stupid","sad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,16,19,22,25,27,44,52,83,107,136,172,202,227,245,248,358,372,455,460,500,531,612,654,708,883,1094,1186,1601,1679,2275,2331,2435],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,16,19,22,25,27,44,52,83,107,136,172,202,227,245,248,358,372,455,460,500,531,612,654,708,883,1094,1186,1601,1679,2275,2331,2435],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.604729392502474,1.7122153074726136,9.169275190960288,2.1439533986393955,2.346825985579986,2.5001408943598484,2.597304642813496,2.6005321873043625,2.7502029743242886,2.689504733779216,9.609247417536244,3.070535816550098,3.2787058260741455,3.216957819005698,3.3814747511661465,3.424750734647968,3.5929222627171646,3.634471265630037,3.6683728173057184,3.8614098879127985,4.218628162481577,4.2574141875167335,4.724033718778229,4.706176101378222,5.0768550934009715,5.089758498236879,5.129498826886393]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0687049162720784E-4,1.061498389178842E-4,1.0697505269638257E-4,1.0635694970225947E-4,1.0635869224113579E-4,1.0621002404391053E-4,1.0652590753681866E-4,1.0616512380108456E-4,1.0640382170116728E-4,1.1804923182167893E-4,0.9915421904175823,1.0599374988444528E-4,1.0797207066404802E-4,1.0951231597742468E-4,1.0607103942114485E-4,1.0577790483352908E-4,1.0841640235229929E-4,1.0653588821026358E-4,1.0620536103210762E-4,1.0629338639341158E-4,1.073218372490924E-4,1.0664143831683817E-4,1.0676286577255358E-4,1.0687789078599512E-4,1.0769812368959303E-4,1.0713489282203865E-4,1.1163864018989524E-4,1.0602526085443308E-4,1.0602809727845911E-4,1.0629671886332352E-4,1.0855603073843226E-4,1.0652971536527977E-4,1.1435062512909844E-4,1.0682936773437536E-4,1.0614066458279194E-4,1.06630573718488E-4,1.0603430898444416E-4,1.0609696745961284E-4,1.057773733967827E-4,1.058048169275657E-4,1.0604297071169257E-4,1.0716149935413504E-4,1.0661696674326478E-4,1.0619543306036511E-4,1.0748581892476042E-4,1.0623619144787592E-4,1.0976589254134235E-4,1.0815175309659962E-4,1.058311152087041E-4,1.0606500844533221E-4,1.0602822110438607E-4,1.0901225381082093E-4,1.0606658649045394E-4,1.0579542387757865E-4,1.0695668005955111E-4,1.0609390642744348E-4,1.1409233634080267E-4,1.0600647126297388E-4,1.058298913325701E-4,1.063351980026106E-4,1.0738995379848427E-4,1.063281633244181E-4,1.058103125660777E-4,1.060566756732652E-4,1.0577865279283825E-4,1.0822615157196828E-4,1.0668988623197006E-4,1.0646262115352198E-4,1.0636951477969427E-4,1.067572485694604E-4,1.0577479381982482E-4,1.0637174476674334E-4,1.0809702385255111E-4,1.0596434812570744E-4,1.0858691053089112E-4,1.0624450709672523E-4,1.070760298835743E-4,1.0642162829328066E-4,1.0574163030664947E-4,1.0587270431981127E-4]}}
{"value":"This Hamlet made for one of the boringest MST3000 episodes ever. I am not a Shakespear fan, but I do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab. It is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many Hamlets listed. Like I said though this one is quite boring. It is in black and white, the pacing is slow, and there is minimal scenery. The actors are all dubbed too so that doesn't help. This is the one MST 3000 I can't watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing Hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep.","finished_norm":["thi","hamlet","make","for","on","of","the","boringest","mst","episod","ever","i","be","not","a","shakespear","fan","but","i","do","not","believ","he","ever","intend","hi","work","to","be","thi","slow","pace","and","drab","it","be","conjur","on","of","the","hard","movi","to","find","becaus","there","be","so","mani","hamlet","list","like","i","sai","though","thi","on","be","quit","bore","it","be","in","black","and","white","the","pace","be","slow","and","there","be","minim","sceneri","the","actor","be","all","dub","too","so","that","doe","not","help","thi","be","the","on","mst","i","ca","not","watch","in","on","sit","caus","the","wai","the","gui","plai","hamlet","sai","hi","line","can","put","anyon","to","sleep"],"filtered":["thi","hamlet","make","boringest","mst","episod","ever","shakespear","fan","believ","ever","intend","hi","work","thi","slow","pace","drab","conjur","hard","movi","find","becaus","mani","hamlet","list","like","sai","though","thi","quit","bore","black","white","pace","slow","minim","sceneri","actor","dub","doe","help","thi","mst","ca","watch","sit","caus","wai","gui","plai","hamlet","sai","hi","line","put","anyon","sleep"],"filtered2":["hamlet","make","boringest","mst","ever","shakespear","fan","believ","ever","intend","work","slow","pace","drab","conjur","hard","find","becaus","mani","hamlet","list","like","though","quit","bore","black","white","pace","slow","minim","sceneri","actor","dub","doe","help","mst","ca","watch","sit","caus","wai","gui","plai","hamlet","line","put","anyon","sleep"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,18,22,33,38,39,40,41,44,48,50,55,81,86,91,107,108,120,140,158,159,171,185,229,244,359,390,453,546,602,732,926,949,1138,1837,2067,3014,4013,5167],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,18,22,33,38,39,40,41,44,48,50,55,81,86,91,107,108,120,140,158,159,171,185,229,244,359,390,453,546,602,732,926,949,1138,1837,2067,3014,4013,5167],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,3.209458785004948,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.9536997889255368,1.949757232424728,2.031112399272319,2.0105926690411424,2.1439533986393955,2.138507503627933,2.2044500422972613,2.317169775997098,2.3106972614914807,2.300267965194495,2.373087554090762,2.518833027372001,2.8432628718938773,2.634508058031767,3.2189558216683714,6.265556250854638,3.2872346624216657,6.914426021585259,3.555828138310924,3.7099788181381825,3.9323057095458362,4.086456389373095,4.224077767249142,5.064116067623542,4.933754249760298,18.89420911248424,5.7959777603641776,12.685042933464494]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.935124919322133E-5,8.874873283129459E-5,8.943866960277956E-5,8.892189201699264E-5,8.892334890207847E-5,8.879905183059388E-5,8.906315265263664E-5,8.876151206892071E-5,8.896108030546057E-5,0.04419865810852718,0.6459091941142983,8.86182314186897E-5,9.027224676259787E-5,9.156000019873133E-5,8.86828509085837E-5,8.843776977171972E-5,9.064373931210231E-5,0.30300859293054383,8.879515322469014E-5,8.8868748619204E-5,8.972860588466382E-5,8.915974451216526E-5,8.926126640739873E-5,8.935743541048819E-5,9.004320782015864E-5,8.957230719236221E-5,9.333775682435604E-5,8.864457680635313E-5,8.864694825637744E-5,8.887153479848508E-5,9.07604784655754E-5,8.906633626510565E-5,9.56051670179601E-5,8.931686672580377E-5,8.874106244175554E-5,8.915066094363489E-5,8.865214167956595E-5,8.870452857274498E-5,8.843732545321389E-5,8.846027017556334E-5,8.86593834928863E-5,8.959455212492793E-5,8.913928455511619E-5,8.878685274189417E-5,8.986570610140882E-5,8.882092962115002E-5,9.177200804493087E-5,9.042247391662432E-5,8.848225738864314E-5,8.867780858853344E-5,8.864705178356337E-5,9.114191304876133E-5,8.867912794526852E-5,8.845241692498595E-5,8.94233087858986E-5,8.870196933451197E-5,9.538921942068193E-5,8.862886738607119E-5,8.848123414209709E-5,8.890370606588389E-5,8.978555611186148E-5,8.889782458003498E-5,8.846486491597E-5,8.867084180488631E-5,8.84383951183201E-5,9.048467627586347E-5,8.920025037746007E-5,8.901024078409013E-5,8.893239730566414E-5,8.925657003045028E-5,8.843516874540741E-5,8.893426173171371E-5,9.037671641847232E-5,8.859364948001135E-5,9.078629614442217E-5,8.882788208858255E-5,8.952309363487883E-5,8.897596786913676E-5,8.840744171538504E-5,8.85170288112658E-5]}}

Your time is more precious than spending a nanosecond watching this embarrassing misfire.","finished_norm":["nation","lampoon","class","reunion","be","a","flop","when","it","be","releas","it","do","not","stai","long","in","theater","in","my","big","citi","why","becaus","it","badbr","br","not","bad","in","a","good","wai","but","bad","in","a","realli","painfulli","unfunni","wai","the","entir","cast","of","actor","be","mostli","unknown","then","and","have","remain","unknown","after","thi","turkeybr","br","the","idea","be","actual","great","a","parodi","of","slasher","flick","but","the","execut","be","sore","lack","in","everi","aspect","br","br","just","avoid","thi","comedi","your","time","be","much","preciou","than","spend","a","nanosecond","watch","thi","embarrass","misfir"],"filtered":["nation","lampoon","class","reunion","flop","releas","stai","long","theater","big","citi","becaus","badbr","br","bad","good","wai","bad","realli","painfulli","unfunni","wai","entir","cast","actor","mostli","unknown","remain","unknown","thi","turkeybr","br","idea","actual","great","parodi","slasher","flick","execut","sore","lack","everi","aspect","br","br","avoid","thi","comedi","time","much","preciou","spend","nanosecond","watch","thi","embarrass","misfir"],"filtered2":["nation","lampoon","class","reunion","flop","releas","stai","long","theater","big","citi","becaus","badbr","bad","good","wai","bad","realli","painfulli","unfunni","wai","entir","cast","actor","mostli","unknown","remain","unknown","turkeybr","idea","actual","great","parodi","slasher","flick","execut","sore","lack","everi","aspect","avoid","comedi","time","preciou","spend","nanosecond","watch","embarrass","misfir"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,8,9,13,22,33,41,51,52,82,85,92,99,123,127,183,198,257,283,327,335,365,424,510,557,595,628,645,662,682,731,948,1055,1240,1294,1511,1628,1952,2540,2574,2881,3450,4253],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,8,9,13,22,33,41,51,52,82,85,92,99,123,127,183,198,257,283,327,335,365,424,510,557,595,628,645,662,682,731,948,1055,1240,1294,1511,1628,1952,2540,2574,2881,3450,4253],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.1317941569733974,1.2979240167361772,2.803707089537043,1.5687599167621034,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.0489535369135887,2.056430207256609,2.2619070973220485,2.4359679371086367,2.4885128563647294,2.5439726117360975,2.7602659523229094,2.7678802023081546,2.9674191958529437,2.908534262247101,3.008694896185175,3.212973749990824,3.374440724508766,3.43462735814388,3.6284289511740746,3.607563812710113,3.558633189238533,3.616452760127359,3.6497387377608255,4.096025840389245,4.049068857301474,4.246178114249808,4.3095999406873045,4.605250182788262,9.132058939269962,4.613282354485526,4.85885294158718,5.156897801074508,5.185068678041204,5.719991853386255,5.770002273960917,5.907203395474402]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.06261112718213536,8.528052797038114E-5,8.59435027561763E-5,8.544692028166432E-5,8.544832023325064E-5,8.532888055740165E-5,8.558266060386193E-5,8.529280780916922E-5,8.548457713404048E-5,9.484047191101815E-5,0.8355732481657248,8.515512641237827E-5,8.674450461868727E-5,8.79819340379658E-5,8.521722064222843E-5,8.4981717012142E-5,8.710147963960419E-5,8.55906790531555E-5,8.532513430481625E-5,8.53958536706044E-5,8.622210864054268E-5,8.567547775758853E-5,8.577303228653624E-5,8.586544310859773E-5,8.652441627135137E-5,8.607191793273957E-5,8.969021785002105E-5,0.03168783743953714,8.518272102698876E-5,8.539853096900101E-5,8.721365675273465E-5,8.558571980418569E-5,9.186902009617316E-5,8.582645980440195E-5,8.527315733140117E-5,8.566674916512966E-5,8.518771149679449E-5,8.523805116662985E-5,8.498129005712466E-5,8.50033381244454E-5,8.519467030785261E-5,8.609329355730736E-5,8.565581735361732E-5,8.5317158195945E-5,8.635385112852945E-5,8.534990338747404E-5,0.06359202871979117,8.688886105738953E-5,8.502446610092712E-5,8.521237537061312E-5,8.518282050844381E-5,8.758018528336834E-5,8.521364316830847E-5,8.499579177043945E-5,8.592874222346924E-5,8.523559194066966E-5,9.166151149833409E-5,8.51653467376137E-5,8.502348284175364E-5,8.542944501793128E-5,8.627683331421979E-5,8.542379337421261E-5,8.500775330734736E-5,8.520568084136489E-5,8.498231792087097E-5,8.694863261544661E-5,8.571440069730875E-5,8.553181647413084E-5,8.545701503497295E-5,8.576851943893906E-5,8.497921763113561E-5,8.545880660126124E-5,8.684489171296605E-5,8.513150510937881E-5,8.723846550450812E-5,8.535658415996992E-5,8.602462758805981E-5,8.54988829077681E-5,8.495257414357332E-5,8.505787869381652E-5]}}

{"value":"The one sheets and newspaper campaign suggested (as often they did) a far more lurid and violent piece than showed up on the drive-in screens. Claude Brook is actually an Americanization of Claudio Brook, who worked in films for years. This one's quite hard to find anymore; I'd love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day, but don't remember particularly impressed way back when. Chances are it was a chopped up version that made it to U.S. theatres and video. But oh, that one sheet...still a gem of my later horror collection.","finished_norm":["the","on","sheet","and","newspap","campaign","suggest","a","often","thei","do","a","far","much","lurid","and","violent","piec","than","show","up","on","the","drivein","screen","claud","brook","be","actual","a","american","of","claudio","brook","who","work","in","film","for","year","thi","on","quit","hard","to","find","anymor","i","have","love","to","see","it","again","to","compar","it","to","other","intern","horror","of","the","dai","but","do","not","rememb","particularli","impress","wai","back","when","chanc","be","it","be","a","chop","up","version","that","make","it","to","u","theatr","and","video","but","oh","that","on","sheetstil","a","gem","of","my","late","horror","collect"],"filtered":["sheet","newspap","campaign","suggest","often","thei","far","much","lurid","violent","piec","show","drivein","screen","claud","brook","actual","american","claudio","brook","work","film","year","thi","quit","hard","find","anymor","love","see","compar","intern","horror","dai","rememb","particularli","impress","wai","back","chanc","chop","version","make","u","theatr","video","oh","sheetstil","gem","late","horror","collect"],"filtered2":["sheet","newspap","campaign","suggest","often","far","lurid","violent","piec","show","drivein","screen","claud","brook","actual","american","claudio","brook","work","year","quit","hard","find","anymor","love","see","compar","intern","horror","dai","rememb","particularli","impress","wai","back","chanc","chop","version","make","u","theatr","video","oh","sheetstil","gem","late","horror","collect"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,28,33,38,48,52,54,57,63,83,101,112,120,132,150,171,192,218,220,223,234,240,290,400,418,482,486,497,646,966,1026,1118,1352,1382,1863,2030,2359,2821,4108,4250,4266,5003,7765],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,28,33,38,48,52,54,57,63,83,101,112,120,132,150,171,192,218,220,223,234,240,290,400,418,482,486,497,646,966,1026,1118,1352,1382,1863,2030,2359,2821,4108,4250,4266,5003,7765],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,1.6955116224012472,1.7122153074726136,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,1.8729627573220065,4.584637595480144,2.098582041218749,2.2466628996789315,2.2044500422972613,2.253494045787767,2.332712011146513,2.373087554090762,2.5318267134339894,2.5940874818617203,2.8336934208777267,2.825563294794476,2.673149229007135,2.7666071276613566,2.8612813773965557,3.130944944345658,3.164467636384302,3.3154667220492153,3.3066947359763783,3.342254038012865,3.5900195030592035,4.026392148630444,4.062925891962901,4.34596758485818,4.436351646326448,4.449957298382227,4.8184434032493035,4.979216623837056,10.781025304512026,5.390512652256013,5.822646007446338,6.101359409915359,6.101359409915359,6.137727054086234,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.184458025624508E-5,8.12926831178763E-5,0.03013047355721112,8.14512946761806E-5,8.145262916393993E-5,8.13387746657142E-5,8.158068757818704E-5,8.130438873306298E-5,8.148719063789996E-5,9.040558980228122E-5,0.49556470288344323,8.117314552401014E-5,8.268820203169043E-5,8.386776740324962E-5,8.123233613493613E-5,8.100784500631207E-5,8.302848436749486E-5,8.158833107281626E-5,8.133520359349465E-5,8.14026160161207E-5,8.219023406967088E-5,0.11276710697845792,8.176215719666353E-5,8.185024675067187E-5,8.247840534417311E-5,8.204706650367119E-5,8.549616931296853E-5,8.119727755590079E-5,8.119944977322949E-5,8.140516812004581E-5,0.0823368265374513,8.15836037257348E-5,0.27305795188122023,8.181308636400102E-5,8.128565714098294E-5,8.166084403274544E-5,8.120420688121395E-5,8.12521925929066E-5,8.1007438016349E-5,8.102845508311351E-5,8.121084028787416E-5,8.206744257211017E-5,8.165042340906584E-5,8.132760045938636E-5,8.231581608216486E-5,8.135881443685527E-5,8.406196382848044E-5,8.282580814772578E-5,8.104859508386077E-5,8.122771743545786E-5,8.119954460278312E-5,8.348480502042016E-5,8.122892594903955E-5,8.10212616078912E-5,8.191058590439616E-5,8.124984836402512E-5,8.737528232620236E-5,8.118288793157374E-5,8.104765780335473E-5,8.143463658187863E-5,8.224239973587674E-5,8.142924921746087E-5,8.1032663805469E-5,8.12213359523954E-5,8.100841781565144E-5,8.288278469846058E-5,8.170626730811331E-5,8.153222099589676E-5,8.146091738374821E-5,8.175785537655984E-5,8.100546250009431E-5,8.14626251737212E-5,8.278389487551479E-5,8.115062878841685E-5,8.315906456877048E-5,8.136518280645165E-5,8.200198752613575E-5,8.150082745228272E-5,8.098006490180192E-5,8.108044525400569E-5]}}
{"value":"but there are not too many of them. Probably the worst \"major release\" film I have seen in my life. Definitely the worst for this year. There is no point in commenting on the plot, the cast or the acting. The problem is beyond all that. It lays in the absolute stupidity of the annoying kind (not the funny kind) of everything that takes place on the screen. I don't know why I gave it a 2/10 instead of 1/10. Probably, because of Steven Martini. He really did try. Bottom line - 95 minutes washed down the toilet along with a few brain cells.

{"value":"A mediocre Sci-Fi Channel original picture. A little squirmish, but not much. The nuclear powered submarine U.S.S. Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep below thick frigid ice near the North Pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric eels. A member of the crew (Simmone Jade Mackinnon)thinks she has devised a way to communicate with the monsters, but is not given much chance for vague reasons. Also among the crew are:David Keith, Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen. This movie could have been somewhat better if the eels/monsters were not so cartoonish.","finished_norm":["a","mediocr","scifi","channel","origin","pictur","a","littl","squirmish","but","not","much","the","nuclear","power","submarin","uss","jimmi","carter","be","on","a","mission","deep","below","thick","frigid","ic","near","the","north","pole","when","it","be","attack","by","giant","super","charg","electr","eel","a","member","of","the","crow","simmon","jade","mackinnonthink","she","have","devis","a","wai","to","commun","with","the","monster","but","be","not","give","much","chanc","for","vagu","reason","conjur","among","the","crow","aredavid","keith","mark","sheppard","and","sean","whalen","thi","movi","can","have","be","somewhat","well","if","the","eelsmonst","be","not","so","cartoonish"],"filtered":["mediocr","scifi","channel","origin","pictur","littl","squirmish","much","nuclear","power","submarin","uss","jimmi","carter","mission","deep","thick","frigid","ic","near","north","pole","attack","giant","super","charg","electr","eel","member","crow","simmon","jade","mackinnonthink","devis","wai","commun","monster","give","much","chanc","vagu","reason","conjur","among","crow","aredavid","keith","mark","sheppard","sean","whalen","thi","movi","somewhat","well","eelsmonst","cartoonish"],"filtered2":["mediocr","scifi","channel","origin","pictur","littl","squirmish","nuclear","power","submarin","uss","jimmi","carter","mission","deep","thick","frigid","ic","near","north","pole","attack","giant","super","charg","electr","eel","member","crow","simmon","jade","mackinnonthink","devis","wai","commun","monster","give","chanc","vagu","reason","conjur","among","crow","aredavid","keith","mark","sheppard","sean","whalen","somewhat","well","eelsmonst","cartoonish"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[14,20,30,33,39,69,95,311,366,413,486,495,555,596,618,717,728,769,781,787,826,834,907,1061,1342,1457,1507,1522,1633,1978,2161,2297,2384,2466,3060,3439,3704,3858,3910,4420,4758,6406,6895],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[14,20,30,33,39,69,95,311,366,413,486,495,555,596,618,717,728,769,781,787,826,834,907,1061,1342,1457,1507,1522,1633,1978,2161,2297,2384,2466,3060,3439,3704,3858,3910,4420,4758,6406,6895],"values":[1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.5538940054862738,2.127032521151058,2.0323326556775485,2.9203338091782562,3.185521045582134,3.467417180966871,3.3066947359763783,3.5173618574831282,3.432149042129413,3.485528930909917,3.5642670069567886,3.7398317812878634,3.7740817043309423,7.715229633888494,3.9363956947973615,3.760240652919071,3.8204358137024927,3.8240921249056035,4.181290492043933,4.218628162481577,4.484804029712395,4.933754249760298,4.550761997504193,4.550761997504193,4.770124825978496,4.979216623837056,5.143104478942172,5.3560264761848435,5.143104478942172,5.3560264761848435,5.444579873526289,5.7446844659766265,5.719991853386255,5.878215858601149,5.967828017290836,6.255510089742618,6.1754673820690815,6.489124940924123,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.816691651522267E-5,6.770725106103636E-5,6.823361037584454E-5,6.783935584817592E-5,6.78404673196429E-5,6.774563990344579E-5,6.794712492856121E-5,6.771700046277672E-5,6.78692529655916E-5,7.529723132878224E-5,0.6139722786762613,6.760769029408034E-5,6.886955430696355E-5,6.985199363227473E-5,6.765698911656614E-5,6.747001438989012E-5,6.915296950078288E-5,6.79534910612806E-5,6.774266561997952E-5,6.779881224533763E-5,6.845480551861415E-5,6.802081577546027E-5,6.809826779341563E-5,0.11043383869724517,0.04291853104167717,6.833556376199895E-5,7.120826104406305E-5,6.76277894405123E-5,6.762959864225584E-5,6.780093784796955E-5,6.92420309095568E-5,6.794955373674634E-5,7.293808981275696E-5,6.81406858043238E-5,6.770139924801675E-5,6.801388583476822E-5,6.763356075412463E-5,6.767352721241224E-5,6.746967541508266E-5,6.748718016165286E-5,6.76390856022771E-5,6.835253463229776E-5,6.800520667993377E-5,6.773633310283065E-5,6.855940057591286E-5,6.7762330677619E-5,7.001373643142915E-5,6.898416402937152E-5,6.750395441530847E-5,6.765314228271644E-5,6.76296776241291E-5,6.95330309752842E-5,6.765414883249863E-5,6.74811888422106E-5,0.1354053314431837,6.7671574745261E-5,7.277334134009162E-5,6.761580457459794E-5,6.750317377080145E-5,6.78254816133759E-5,0.09214882665770113,6.782099457196944E-5,6.749068553274211E-5,6.764782725731342E-5,6.747049147275002E-5,6.903161879992695E-5,6.805171808474929E-5,6.790675796158043E-5,6.78473704326647E-5,6.809468488284349E-5,6.746803004221634E-5,6.784879282100305E-5,6.894925519950471E-5,6.758893649962532E-5,6.926172746192125E-5,6.776763478104595E-5,6.829801827164848E-5,6.788061082929683E-5,6.744687682770825E-5,6.753048186382696E-5]}}
