{"value":"Much has been written about Purple Rain, the apparent \"quin-essential\" musician bio movie, however I'm here to tell you that the movie does not deserve it's high praise.<br /><br />First of all let's get one thing straight Prince is a great musician and Music is the one area where Purple Rain excels. Even the score is mesmerising, and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it's not and as such the movie has some problems.<br /><br />First of all is the horrendous acting/writing, Prince's character \"The Kid\" is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and incensere. A good loner character should at least have some talkative moments, unfortunately Prince's character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and it's hard to believe that he'd get the girl this way. Everything just seems a little off here, which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that's terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live, but we aren't ever allowed to get inside of it.<br /><br />A surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert. Prince and Morris's lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here, which I guess makes sense from a business perspective, but it's exhausting to have a 2 hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage, especially when the character's back stories get pushed aside for it.<br /><br />So to sum it up: This isn't a very good movie.","finished_norm":["much","have","be","write","about","purpl","rain","the","appar","quinessenti","musician","bio","movi","howev","i","be","here","to","tell","you","that","the","movi","doe","not","deserv","it","high","praisebr","br","of","all","let","get","on","thing","straight","princ","be","a","great","musician","and","music","be","the","on","area","where","purpl","rain","excel","even","the","score","be","mesmeris","and","if","thi","be","shoot","pure","a","a","concert","film","it","would","be","a","great","experi","unfortun","it","not","and","a","such","the","movi","have","some","problemsbr","br","of","all","be","the","horrend","actingwrit","princ","charact","the","kid","be","suppos","to","come","off","a","some","typ","of","mysteri","lone","of","few","word","unfortun","thi","just","come","off","a","corni","and","incenser","a","good","lone","charact","should","at","littl","have","some","talk","moment","unfortun","princ","charact","rare","have","over","a","few","word","of","dialog","in","the","film","and","it","hard","to","believ","that","he","have","get","the","girl","thi","wai","everyth","just","seem","a","littl","off","here","which","be","a","shame","becaus","you","can","tell","thi","be","a","charact","that","terribli","conflict","and","live","a","veri","complic","live","but","we","be","not","ever","allow","to","get","insid","of","itbr","br","a","surpris","aspect","of","thi","film","be","just","how","much","of","thi","take","place","in","concert","princ","and","morri","live","seemingli","take","a","back","seat","to","the","perform","here","which","i","guess","make","sens","from","a","busi","perspect","but","it","exhaust","to","have","a","hour","movi","where","seemingli","half","of","it","take","place","on","stage","especi","when","the","charact","back","stori","get","push","asid","for","itbr","br","so","to","sum","it","up","thi","be","not","a","veri","good","movi"],"filtered":["much","write","purpl","rain","appar","quinessenti","musician","bio","movi","howev","tell","movi","doe","deserv","high","praisebr","br","let","get","thing","straight","princ","great","musician","music","area","purpl","rain","excel","even","score","mesmeris","thi","shoot","pure","concert","film","great","experi","unfortun","movi","problemsbr","br","horrend","actingwrit","princ","charact","kid","suppos","come","typ","mysteri","lone","word","unfortun","thi","come","corni","incenser","good","lone","charact","littl","talk","moment","unfortun","princ","charact","rare","word","dialog","film","hard","believ","get","girl","thi","wai","everyth","seem","littl","shame","becaus","tell","thi","charact","terribli","conflict","live","veri","complic","live","ever","allow","get","insid","itbr","br","surpris","aspect","thi","film","much","thi","take","place","concert","princ","morri","live","seemingli","take","back","seat","perform","guess","make","sens","busi","perspect","exhaust","hour","movi","seemingli","half","take","place","stage","especi","charact","back","stori","get","push","asid","itbr","br","sum","thi","veri","good","movi"],"filtered2":["write","purpl","rain","appar","quinessenti","musician","bio","howev","tell","doe","deserv","high","praisebr","let","get","thing","straight","princ","great","musician","music","area","purpl","rain","excel","even","score","mesmeris","shoot","pure","concert","great","experi","unfortun","problemsbr","horrend","actingwrit","princ","charact","kid","suppos","come","typ","mysteri","lone","word","unfortun","come","corni","incenser","good","lone","charact","littl","talk","moment","unfortun","princ","charact","rare","word","dialog","hard","believ","get","girl","wai","everyth","seem","littl","shame","becaus","tell","charact","terribli","conflict","live","veri","complic","live","ever","allow","get","insid","itbr","surpris","aspect","take","place","concert","princ","morri","live","seemingli","take","back","seat","perform","guess","make","sens","busi","perspect","exhaust","hour","seemingli","half","take","place","stage","especi","charact","back","stori","get","push","asid","itbr","sum","veri","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,10,14,15,17,18,22,29,31,33,34,35,44,51,63,65,84,90,91,105,113,114,116,117,118,124,149,164,171,173,174,186,188,193,206,211,227,243,258,267,308,326,333,384,403,423,430,432,518,521,548,574,580,645,669,726,790,890,936,1013,1148,1152,1157,1205,1256,1331,1485,1681,1691,1750,1980,2061,2101,2586,2926,3013,4046,4312,4985,6468,7801],"values":[1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,10,14,15,17,18,22,29,31,33,34,35,44,51,63,65,84,90,91,105,113,114,116,117,118,124,149,164,171,173,174,186,188,193,206,211,227,243,258,267,308,326,333,384

{"value":"I rented this film on Netflix after it won all the Oscars, to see if it was really that good.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is a very realistic portrayal (for the most part) of a group of soldier's rotation in Iraq. The film centers around Will James, a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks, and defusing bombs.<br /><br />Where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the Plot and Direction of the movie. This film has no clear plot unlike other films such as Black Hawk Down. What this film tries to do is focus more on the characters, and their different attitudes about the war. Bigelow does an okay job of focusing on the characters, but there are many points in the film where the dialogue seems to drag. Hurt Locker is 131 minutes long, yet it feels like a 3 hour movie.<br /><br />One scene in the movie that was particularly awful, and ruined the films perfect credibility, was the sniping scene halfway through the movie. It was both unrealistic, and very long.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this film was OKAY, but the reason I gave it a 6 instead of a 7, was because it was a major letdown for winning Best Picture at the Oscars. I felt like this film could have been so much better considering Saving Private Ryan lost Best Picture, but was much better than this film. Another notable mention is Black Hawk Down which only won 2 Oscars.

{"value":"I have seen poor movies in my time, but this really takes the biscuit! Why oh why has this film been made? There just is nothing here whatsoever. Please put your trust in me, flick the off switch and destroy your copy of this film. There is a plot... that could take about 5 minutes to show on camera. This is the key problem, the story 'based on a true story' (mmm... whatever) just in no way lends itself to be padded out for 80 minutes. And so we therefore have to sit through over an hour of watching people walk around. That is it! In the whole first half an hour absolutely nothing happens, apart from watching someone walk to a shop... and then 3 guys walking through a wood. This time could perhaps have been spent on developing character... but no. And so there is absolutely no connection to the people on screen, and so when they start to get shot, we couldn't care less! In fact I was in the end vouching for the baddie so that the film would end! On top of this the camera work is truly horrific! This director/editor/writer/producer, Ti West is rubbish. I hate to hit a guy, but really, his work is pants! These dull close ups continuously, and then long single takes following people as they walk - I'm sure he thinks he's clever, but the results are so dull I just wanted to stop the film and slit my wrists! How this man has been brought on to direct the next cabin fever movie is beyond me! To finish, the acting is also woeful,... which goes for the film as a whole.

{"value":"I have copy of this on VHS, I think they (The television networks) should play this every year for the next twenty years. So that we don't forget what was and that we remember not to do the same mistakes again. Like putting some people in the director's chair, where they don't belong. This movie Rappin' is like a vaudevillian musical, for those who can't sing, or act. This movie is as much fun as trying to teach the 'blind' to drive a city bus.<br /><br />John Hood, (Peebles) has just got out of prison and he's headed back to the old neighborhood. In serving time for an all-to-nice crime of necessity, of course. John heads back onto the old street and is greeted by kids dogs old ladies and his peer homeys as they dance and sing all along the way.<br /><br />I would recommend this if I was sentimental, or if in truth someone was smoking medicinal pot prescribed by a doctor for glaucoma. Either way this is a poorly directed, scripted, acted and even produced (I never thought I'd sat that) satire of ghetto life with the 'Hood'. Although, I think the redeeming part of the story, through the wannabe gang fight sequences and the dance numbers, his friends care about their neighbors and want to save the ghetto from being torn down and cleaned up. <br /><br />Forget Sonny spoon, Mario could have won an Oscar for that in comparison to this Rap.

{"value":"Have you ever seen a movie made up entirely of long wide shots? No? Me, neither. Well, I've finally seen one in \"Spring in my Hometown,\" and I must confess, now I KNOW why people don't do this. The technique is \"arty,\" to be sure, but it's definitely NOT ripe for public consumption. The technique is heavily flawed simply because the viewer has no emotional attachment to the characters, and perhaps that might be the director's whole intentions. I don't know, I can't read minds, and I certainly don't know enough about the director to make a judgement.<br /><br />But one thing about this movie that IS painfully obvious is its ridiculous anti-American sentiments. As an American, I'm well aware of my country's participation in the Korean War, and I'm very well aware that we weren't always angels, but I'll be damn if I'll take this guy's version of how things happened. According to this blind fool, Americans were not only at the root of the war, we were the CAUSE of the war, and we almost singlehandedly destroyed the country. Whatever, Mister Director. And I suppose you'd still be making this film in COMMUNIST KOREA if we hadn't interfered, right? Talk about forgetting your history. This is almost akin to making the Nazis the \"good guys\" while turning the Allied forces into the \"bad guys.\" This movie is so historically naive and so factually inaccurate that it's almost embarrassing to watch. For a man who comes from a country that owes its very EXISTENCE to American interference, he sure comes off as high and mighty and judgemental.","finished_norm":["have","you","ever","see","a","movi","make","up","entir","of","long","wide","shot","no","me","neither","good","i","have","final","see","on","in","spring","in","my","hometown","and","i","must","confess","now","i","know","why","peopl","do","not","do","thi","the","techniqu","be","arti","to","be","sure","but","it","definit","not","ripe","for","public","consumpt","the","techniqu","be","heavili","flaw","simpli","becaus","the","viewer","have","no","emot","attach","to","the","charact","and","perhap","that","mai","be","the","director","whole","intent","i","do","not","know","i","ca","not","read","mind","and","i","certainli","do","not","know","enough","about","the","director","to","make","a","judgementbr","br","but","on","thing","about","thi","movi","that","be","painfulli","obviou","be","it","ridicul","antiamerican","sentim","a","a","american","i","be","good","awar","of","my","countri","particip","in","the","korean","war","and","i","be","veri","good","awar","that","we","be","not","alwai","angel","but","i","will","be","damn","if","i","will","take","thi","gui","version","of","how","thing","happen","accord","to","thi","blind","fool","american","be","not","onli","at","the","root","of","the","war","we","be","the","caus","of","the","war","and","we","almost","singlehandedli","destroi","the","countri","whatev","mister","director","and","i","suppos","you","have","still","be","make","thi","film","in","communist","korea","if","we","have","not","interfer","right","talk","about","forget","your","histori","thi","be","almost","akin","to","make","the","nazi","the","good","gui","while","turn","the","alli","forc","into","the","bad","gui","thi","movi","be","so","histor","naiv","and","so","factual","inaccur","that","it","almost","embarrass","to","watch","for","a","man","who","come","from","a","countri","that","ow","it","veri","exist","to","american","interfer","he","sure","come","off","a","high","and","mighti","and","judgement"],"filtered":["ever","see","movi","make","entir","long","wide","shot","neither","good","final","see","spring","hometown","must","confess","know","peopl","thi","techniqu","arti","sure","definit","ripe","public","consumpt","techniqu","heavili","flaw","simpli","becaus","viewer","emot","attach","charact","perhap","mai","director","whole","intent","know","ca","read","mind","certainli","know","enough","director","make","judgementbr","br","thing","thi","movi","painfulli","obviou","ridicul","antiamerican","sentim","american","good","awar","countri","particip","korean","war","veri","good","awar","alwai","angel","damn","take","thi","gui","version","thing","happen","accord","thi","blind","fool","american","onli","root","war","caus","war","almost","singlehandedli","destroi","countri","whatev","mister","director","suppos","still","make","thi","film","communist","korea","interfer","right","talk","forget","histori","thi","almost","akin","make","nazi","good","gui","turn","alli","forc","bad","gui","thi","movi","histor","naiv","factual","inaccur","almost","embarrass","watch","man","come","countri","ow","veri","exist","american","interfer","sure","come","high","mighti","judgement"],"filtered2":["ever","see","make","entir","long","wide","shot","neither","good","final","see","spring","hometown","must","confess","know","peopl","techniqu","arti","sure","definit","ripe","public","consumpt","techniqu","heavili","flaw","simpli","becaus","viewer","emot","attach","charact","perhap","mai","director","whole","intent","know","ca","read","mind","certainli","know","enough","director","make","judgementbr","thing","painfulli","obviou","ridicul","antiamerican","sentim","american","good","awar","countri","particip","korean","war","veri","good","awar","alwai","angel","damn","take","gui","version","thing","happen","accord","blind","fool","american","onli","root","war","caus","war","almost","singlehandedli","destroi","countri","whatev","mister","director","suppos","still","make","communist","korea","interfer","right","talk","forget","histori","almost","akin","make","nazi","good","gui","turn","alli","forc","bad","gui","histor","naiv","factual","inaccur","almost","embarrass","watch","man","come","countri","ow","veri","exist","american","interfer","sure","come","high","mighti","judgement"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,9,10,11,15,22,23,26,29,31,34,44,45,46,55,58,64,81,93,94,96,99,111,119,121,131,141,145,149,156,186,197,198,201,211,220,223,238,274,279,314,318,338,372,383,389,392,441,452,499,506,528,556,557,608,718,738,780,811,889,923,953,1036,1057,1241,1363,1379,1493,1582,1625,1794,1934,1949,2016,2080,2098,2209,2280,2404,2615,2776,3074,3241,3262,3645,3858,3946,4428,5041,5068,5769,6409,6703,7017,7236,7913],"values":[4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,

{"value":"\"Envy\" is bad for a number of reasons. Yes, there are unlikeable characters. That's not the problem. It is that they are unlikeable and we do not care for them at all. \"The War of the Roses\" featured unlikeable characters but due to proper introductions we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their fate, whereas in \"Envy\" the introduction is thin, the characters are never believable, and the plot only makes things worse.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is simply repulsive in his role and I'm a fan of his work most of the time. Stiller campaigned to have this released straight-to-video and now I can see why. The movie proposes that he's \"best friends\" with Jack Black, but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate Stiller hates Black. I thought this would develop into some sort of one-sided relationship (a la \"The Cable Guy\") but it never does, instead Stiller insists he's his \"best friend\" and I felt confused as he seemed to treat Black like, well, \"poo.\" The movie's plot is ridiculous but it doesn't matter, because it's supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale. Unfortunately the message is lost in the mess. Walken gives a good performance but Black is off-key and annoying (and I usually find him very funny). No, it's not a horrible film but I still can't believe Barry Levinson (\"Rain Man,\" \"Sleepers\") is responsible for this - it's not one of the worst films of all time but it could certainly be a whole lot better. I wish Va-Poo-Rize did exist - so we could make this film disappear

{"value":"Really, really bad slasher movie. A psychotic person escapes from an asylum. Three years later he kills a sociology professor, end of scene. One semester yesterday later (hey, that's what the title card said) a new sociology professor is at the school. She makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there, and starts dating another professor. The students are all bored, as are we.<br /><br />There are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed. Scenes are pretty short, and cut to different characters somewhere else, making for little progression of any kind. A lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking, or sitting and talking, and serve little purpose. Despite the passage of time, many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing. Sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time, we ask ourselves: how long has that body been there? And also, at least one of the dead people don't seem to have been missed by others.<br /><br />The killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast, another by stabbing him in the crotch, and another by slicing her forehead. Is his knife poisoned or something?<br /><br />The video box cover has a cheerleader: there aren't any in the movie. The rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room. The central redhead in the photo is in the movie, but nobody ever wears such an outfit, and there is no such scene. The killer is strictly

{"value":"When I was younger, I liked this show, but now...BLECCH!!! This show is sappy, badly written, and rarely funny. The three leads were all good actors and funny men (Saget's stand up was a lot better than the stuff this show came up with, as was Coulier a better stand up, and Stamos was a better than average actor). After a while, Stamos wanted off the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff (who could blame him?). The show eventually got cancelled when many of the actors demanded more money.<br /><br />Here are a few things that drive me crazy about the show:<br /><br />1. The catch phrases- How many times can one person put up with tiring catch phrases like with 'how rude', 'you got it dude', 'nerdbomber', 'cut it out' and 'have mercy' in a 24 hour time period? <br /><br />2. Kimmy Gibler- the most annoying character ever written for television.<br /><br />3. The writing- stale and cliched as an oreo cookie. There is good cliched writing and bad cliched writing. Full House had bad cliched writing.<br /><br />4. Three men living together in San Francisco- Enough said.<br /><br />5. Unrealistic stuff- Too much to recall.<br /><br />6. Trendy kids- The girls had all the latest mall fashions and you can see posters of trendy recording artists they would be into.<br /><br />Now this show is on Nick @ Nite. I would hardly call it a classic. I have nothing bad to say about the people involved since I think many of them are talented in their own right.

{"value":"!!!!! OF COURSE THERE'S SPOILERS !!!!! I'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies: Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug takers - Check Heorine knocks out villain - Check Heroine doesn't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class . Dear oh dear if only London transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here . In fact there's so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he's been killing people on the underground . I'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless Not to be totally negative I doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and there's always a market for horror movies . Likewise I doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the DVD market rather than cinema distribution and I will state that it's slightly better than 1972's DEATH LINE which also featured a

{"value":"The Nutcracker has always been a somewhat problematic ballet. It bears little resemblance to ETA Hoffman's original story on which it is based.<br /><br />In the ballet, the story is essentially over by the second-half when Clara (or Marie in this version) travels to the Kingdom of Sweets to watch a series of character dances.<br /><br />There's an infinite variety of stage productions that re-interpret the story in myriad ways (not always successfully) to compensate for the ballet's weak libretto.<br /><br />Balanchine's version doesn't really have any sense of drama or story at all (despite the fact that there is plenty of drama and mystery in Tchaikovsky's wonderful first-act music). The result is a completely forgettable first-half Christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing (the little that there is of it) isn't particularly memorable.<br /><br />The pantomime over-acting, particularly of Drosselmeier, which might look passable on the stage, just looks silly filmed for the big screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, things aren't much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets (Act II in the stage version). Although there are a few choreographic highlights, most of the choreography is bland and uninspiring. This certainly isn't vintage Balanchine.<br /><br />Balanchine is widely regarded as a master of abstract dance, but I have always felt he was less successful as a creator of narrative ballets. Watching this film version of his stage production of The Nutcracker has only re-affirmed this view.","finished_norm":["the","nutcrack","have","alwai","be","a","somewhat","problemat","ballet","it","bear","littl","resembl","to","eta","hoffman","origin","stori","on","which","it","be","basedbr","br","in","the","ballet","the","stori","be","essenti","over","by","the","secondhalf","when","clara","or","mari","in","thi","version","travel","to","the","kingdom","of","sweet","to","watch","a","seri","of","charact","dancesbr","br","there","a","infinit","varieti","of","stage","product","that","reinterpret","the","stori","in","myriad","wai","not","alwai","successfulli","to","compens","for","the","ballet","weak","librettobr","br","balanchin","version","doe","not","realli","have","ani","sens","of","drama","or","stori","at","all","despit","the","fact","that","there","be","plenti","of","drama","and","mysteri","in","tchaikovski","wonder","firstact","music","the","result","be","a","complet","forgett","firsthalf","christma","parti","where","hardli","anyth","happen","and","where","even","the","danc","the","littl","that","there","be","of","it","be","not","particularli","memorablebr","br","the","pantomim","overact","particularli","of","drosselmei","which","mai","look","passabl","on","the","stage","just","look","silli","film","for","the","big","screenbr","br","unfortun","thing","be","not","much","well","when","we","get","to","the","kingdom","of","sweet","act","ii","in","the","stage","version","although","there","be","a","few","choreograph","highlight","much","of","the","choreographi","be","bland","and","uninspir","thi","certainli","be","not","vintag","balanchinebr","br","balanchin","be","wide","regard","a","a","master","of","abstract","danc","but","i","have","alwai","feel","he","be","littl","success","a","a","creator","of","narr","ballet","watch","thi","film","version","of","hi","stage","product","of","the","nutcrack","have","onli","reaffirm","thi","view"],"filtered":["nutcrack","alwai","somewhat","problemat","ballet","bear","littl","resembl","eta","hoffman","origin","stori","basedbr","br","ballet","stori","essenti","secondhalf","clara","mari","thi","version","travel","kingdom","sweet","watch","seri","charact","dancesbr","br","infinit","varieti","stage","product","reinterpret","stori","myriad","wai","alwai","successfulli","compens","ballet","weak","librettobr","br","balanchin","version","doe","realli","ani","sens","drama","stori","despit","fact","plenti","drama","mysteri","tchaikovski","wonder","firstact","music","result","complet","forgett","firsthalf","christma","parti","hardli","anyth","happen","even","danc","littl","particularli","memorablebr","br","pantomim","overact","particularli","drosselmei","mai","look","passabl","stage","look","silli","film","big","screenbr","br","unfortun","thing","much","well","get","kingdom","sweet","act","ii","stage","version","although","choreograph","highlight","much","choreographi","bland","uninspir","thi","certainli","vintag","balanchinebr","br","balanchin","wide","regard","master","abstract","danc","alwai","feel","littl","success","creator","narr","ballet","watch","thi","film","version","hi","stage","product","nutcrack","onli","reaffirm","thi","view"],"filtered2":["nutcrack","alwai","somewhat","problemat","ballet","bear","littl","resembl","eta","hoffman","origin","stori","basedbr","ballet","stori","essenti","secondhalf","clara","mari","version","travel","kingdom","sweet","watch","charact","dancesbr","infinit","varieti","stage","product","reinterpret","stori","myriad","wai","alwai","successfulli","compens","ballet","weak","librettobr","balanchin","version","doe","realli","ani","sens","drama","stori","despit","fact","plenti","drama","mysteri","tchaikovski","wonder","firstact","music","result","complet","forgett","firsthalf","christma","parti","hardli","anyth","happen","even","danc","littl","particularli","memorablebr","pantomim","overact","particularli","drosselmei","mai","look","passabl","stage","look","silli","big","screenbr","unfortun","thing","well","get","kingdom","sweet","act","ii","stage","version","although","choreograph","highlight","choreographi","bland","uninspir","certainli","vintag","balanchinebr","balanchin","wide","regard","master","abstract","danc","alwai","feel","littl","success","creator","narr","ballet","watch","version","stage","product","nutcrack","onli","reaffirm","view"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,7,10,11,13,14,16,17,18,20,21,27,29,33,43,46,69,82,94,97,103,104,118,173,175,190,197,220,227,237,312,379,385,389,391,403,447,463,492,497,525,532,596,665,669,748,850,888,921,1019,1028,1032,1053,1059,1169,1197,1198,1385,1388,1391,1415,1549,1582,2088,2519,2620,3064,3169,3219,3420,3993,4097,4111,4521,4831,6352,6361,6848,7459],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeat

{"value":"Thomas Clay has been mixing with the wrong types. That's the trouble with young people these days, they have no respect.<br /><br />Seriously this film should be avoided at all costs. The action in the main body of the film is slow and rather stodgy and ambles to the drug crazed ending as if, like it's director, it has no where better to go. We are introduced to the main title character who is a bit of an outsider, we see him at school and at home not quite fitting in, feeling awkward in himself as so many adolescents do. Robert falls in with bad lads and starts missing school and taking drugs and before you know it he is a psycho rapist.<br /><br />The film is really about Clay's total failure to understand the links between violence imagery and violent acts. Clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our TVs. yet he has filmed the most disgusting piece of SIMULATED violence. Is this guy for real?<br /><br />If Clay has not seen YouTube perhaps he is naive and unaware of will be done with the brutal climax scene from his film? All anyone will want to see is the most hideous scene from the end of the film and I am sure that will be what sticks with people. <br /><br />The rest of the film is pointless for in committing such an act of violence to film Clay not only damns young people who are actively engaged in preventing war, he also damns himself as perpetrator of extreme, tasteless violence for no better reason than

{"value":"I heard so much about this movie how it was a great slasher and one of those early 80's movies that die hard fans of most slasher movies just had to see. Well, I rented it and I have to say that although it kept my attention as far as the suspense goes for most slasher films such as \"April Fools Day\", \"Friday 13th\" and \"Prom Night\", this film could have been right up there with the above mentioned only it lacked true enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the on going story. Characters that I found were unfortunate to be in this movie was the weirdo guy with the frizzy hair that kept creeping around the dorm and of course leading up to his true climatic role during the end with he faces the killer. Another would be the dirty scruffy looking guy with the jean jacket, he could have played more roles in this movie that might have made the movie more interesting, instead, the movie played this guy as just another loser out there making unknown calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then drops his part and cuts him off until the end which was a waste, I was disappointed in his part in the end. As far as the true identity of the killer goes, when the identity was released as to who he was, I just laughed, but it was all to obvious and he really made a true jerk out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed. This movie should be one to at least watch once for all slasher fans but don't spend your hard earned money on it in some rare hard to find collectors inventory.","finished_norm":["i","hear","so","much","about","thi","movi","how","it","be","a","great","slasher","and","on","of","that","earli","movi","that","die","hard","fan","of","much","slasher","movi","just","have","to","see","good","i","rent","it","and","i","have","to","sai","that","although","it","keep","my","attent","a","far","a","the","suspens","go","for","much","slasher","film","such","a","april","fool","dai","fridai","th","and","prom","night","thi","film","can","have","be","right","up","there","with","the","abov","mention","onli","it","lack","true","enthusiasm","and","potenti","from","the","charact","a","good","a","the","on","go","stori","charact","that","i","find","be","unfortun","to","be","in","thi","movi","be","the","weirdo","gui","with","the","frizzi","hair","that","keep","creep","around","the","dorm","and","of","cours","lead","up","to","hi","true","climat","role","dure","the","end","with","he","face","the","killer","anoth","would","be","the","dirti","scruffi","look","gui","with","the","jean","jacket","he","can","have","plai","much","role","in","thi","movi","that","mai","have","make","the","movi","much","interest","instead","the","movi","plai","thi","gui","a","just","anoth","loser","out","there","make","unknown","call","while","he","sleep","with","hi","girlfriend","and","then","drop","hi","part","and","cut","him","off","until","the","end","which","be","a","wast","i","be","disappoint","in","hi","part","in","the","end","a","far","a","the","true","ident","of","the","killer","go","when","the","ident","be","releas","a","to","who","he","be","i","just","laugh","but","it","be","all","to","obviou","and","he","realli","make","a","true","jerk","out","of","himself","a","good","a","a","annoi","charact","after","hi","true","intent","be","reveal","thi","movi","should","be","on","to","at","littl","watch","onc","for","all","slasher","fan","but","do","not","spend","your","hard","earn","monei","on","it","in","some","rare","hard","to","find","collector","inventori"],"filtered":["hear","much","thi","movi","great","slasher","earli","movi","die","hard","fan","much","slasher","movi","see","good","rent","sai","although","keep","attent","far","suspens","go","much","slasher","film","april","fool","dai","fridai","th","prom","night","thi","film","right","abov","mention","onli","lack","true","enthusiasm","potenti","charact","good","go","stori","charact","find","unfortun","thi","movi","weirdo","gui","frizzi","hair","keep","creep","around","dorm","cours","lead","hi","true","climat","role","dure","end","face","killer","anoth","dirti","scruffi","look","gui","jean","jacket","plai","much","role","thi","movi","mai","make","movi","much","interest","instead","movi","plai","thi","gui","anoth","loser","make","unknown","call","sleep","hi","girlfriend","drop","hi","part","cut","end","wast","disappoint","hi","part","end","far","true","ident","killer","go","ident","releas","laugh","obviou","realli","make","true","jerk","good","annoi","charact","hi","true","intent","reveal","thi","movi","littl","watch","onc","slasher","fan","spend","hard","earn","monei","rare","hard","find","collector","inventori"],"filtered2":["hear","great","slasher","earli","die","hard","fan","slasher","see","good","rent","although","keep","attent","far","suspens","go","slasher","april","fool","dai","fridai","th","prom","night","right","abov","mention","onli","lack","true","enthusiasm","potenti","charact","good","go","stori","charact","find","unfortun","weirdo","gui","frizzi","hair","keep","creep","around","dorm","cours","lead","true","climat","role","dure","end","face","killer","anoth","dirti","scruffi","look","gui","jean","jacket","plai","role","mai","make","interest","instead","plai","gui","anoth","loser","make","unknown","call","sleep","girlfriend","drop","part","cut","end","wast","disappoint","part","end","far","true","ident","killer","go","ident","releas","laugh","obviou","realli","make","true","jerk","good","annoi","charact","true","intent","reveal","littl","watch","onc","slasher","fan","spend","hard","earn","monei","rare","hard","find","collector","inventori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,10,11,13,14,16,17,24,38,40,46,51,55,60,61,73,89,98,101,121,126,128,132,133,134,140,142,152,157,171,183,187,199,210,216,227,236,237,239,251,252,266,271,283,285,293,303,304,327,383,529,547,636,661,704,730,731,732,811,813,833,853,904,1013,1057,1512,1524,1608,1634,1676,1893,1918,2045,2047,2200,3674,4427,4479,4742,5552,6107,6263],"values":[3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,10,11,13,14,16,17,24,38,40,46,51,55,60,61,73,89,98,101,121,126,128,132,133,134,140,142,152,157,171,183,187,199,210,216,227,23

{"value":"I am truly beginning to believe that Seagal is on a mission to see how crappy his films could become.This particular movie was a complete and utter waste of time to see.My first complaint was the cover of the DVD where they have doctored his pic and made him look slimmer and younger when in the film he looks like crap.He has his big pot belly and double chin going for him and the most miserable and bored look on his face.<br /><br />The whole plot was ridiculous to begin with and drawn out way too long.The whole film was leading up to the finale where Seagal and his team had to take on a bunch of people under the influence of a top secret military chemical adrenaline enhancer.There was way too much useless dialogue and not to mention the ridiculous and constant dubbing of Seagals voice even in the middle of a statement.The dubbed voice sounded like a man with a frog in his throat and was quite comical.<br /><br />The fight scenes in the film were horrible.Half the time when Seagal fought you could not even see what was going on.There would be tight shots of him flapping his arms at the camera and then the person flying through a wall or something.It was reminiscent of the old Kung Fu series on television.They used way too much slow motion for the fight scenes.<br /><br />I believe this is Seagals worst film to date and I am glad I did not purchase this film or I would have been very upset since I am a huge fan of Seagal the Aikidoist.The action star is quickly fading away and seems to be getting worse with every

{"value":"I bought this movie last weekend at my local Movie Gallery. It was buy 2 get 2 free and I needed one more so I chose this one. Horrible mistake. The box reads like it would be a really good movie. Well, it starts out like it is going to be this great movie. For about 5 minutes, that is. The movie is about a young woman, Laila, who gets killed trying to save her beau, Jack, from a bull. Laila's dad, Cordobes, is a rancher that the townspeople are afraid of. He assumes that Jack killed Laila because she was supposedly afraid of this bull, and goes on this hunt to find him. That was the first 5 minutes that is good. What follows after that is only gonna get 100 times worse. Whoever wrote the script, in my opinion, had to of been on some kind acid trip or something because nothing else made any sense what so ever. Jack is on the run and finds this traveling radio DJ named Mary who gives him a ride. I think Mary is supposed to be a virgin Mary type character. You know, Jesus' mother. But, who knows, I couldn't make heads or tails of it. As they're running... we get to see bad guys, magical visions, ghostly encounters, flashbacks, etc... And all these things are done in such a way that your brain hurts from trying to figure out what's going on. Needless to say, I took the movie back and exchanged it for something else. It's horrible I tell ya, horrible. And, there is absolutely no bull-fighting in this movie. Unless you count the first minute of the movie. Hope I helped some other people keep from wasting their time on this

{"value":"In this movie, Chávez supporters (either venezuelan and not-venezuelan) just lie about a dramatic situation in our country. <br /><br />They did not say that the conflict started because of Chávez announcement firing a lot of PDVSA best workers just for political issues.<br /><br />They did not say anything about more than 96 TV interruptions transmitted by Chávez during only 3 days in \"CADENA NACIONAL\" (a kind of confiscation o private TV signals). Each one with about 20 minutes of duration.<br /><br />They did not tell us anything about The quiting announcement made by General en Jefe Lucas Rincon Romero, Inspector General of the army forces, who is a traditional supporter of Chávez. Even now, in despite of his announcement, he is the Ministro de Interior y Justicia. After Chávez return he occuped the Charge of Ministro del Defensa (equals to Defense Secretary in US).<br /><br />They did not say anything about Chávez orders about shooting against a pacifical people concentration who was claiming for elections.<br /><br />They did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by Chávez Supporters (either civilians and Military official forces).<br /><br />They present some facts in a wrong order, in order to lie.<br /><br />They did not say anything about venezuelan civilian society thats are even now claiming for an elections in order to solve the crisis and Chávez actions in order to avoid the elections.<br /><br />That's why i tell you.... This movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie.","finished_norm":["in","thi","movi","chávez","support","either","venezuelan","and","notvenezuelan","just","lie","about","a","dramat","situat","in","our","countri","br","br","thei","do","not","sai","that","the","conflict","start","becaus","of","chávez","announc","fire","a","lot","of","pdvsa","well","worker","just","for","polit","issuesbr","br","thei","do","not","sai","anyth","about","much","than","tv","interrupt","transmit","by","chávez","dure","onli","dai","in","cadena","nacion","a","kind","of","confisc","o","privat","tv","signal","each","on","with","about","minut","of","durationbr","br","thei","do","not","tell","u","anyth","about","the","quit","announc","make","by","gener","en","jefe","luca","rincon","romero","inspector","gener","of","the","armi","forc","who","be","a","tradit","support","of","chávez","even","now","in","despit","of","hi","announc","he","be","the","ministro","de","interior","y","justicia","after","chávez","return","he","occup","the","charg","of","ministro","del","defensa","equal","to","defens","secretari","in","usbr","br","thei","do","not","sai","anyth","about","chávez","order","about","shoot","against","a","pacif","peopl","concentr","who","be","claim","for","electionsbr","br","thei","do","not","sai","anyth","about","the","peopl","in","thi","concentr","that","be","kill","by","chávez","support","either","civilian","and","militari","offici","forcesbr","br","thei","present","some","fact","in","a","wrong","order","in","order","to","liebr","br","thei","do","not","sai","anyth","about","venezuelan","civilian","societi","that","be","even","now","claim","for","a","elect","in","order","to","solv","the","crisi","and","chávez","action","in","order","to","avoid","the","electionsbr","br","that","why","i","tell","you","thi","movi","be","just","a","lot","of","lie","or","a","big","lie"],"filtered":["thi","movi","chávez","support","either","venezuelan","notvenezuelan","lie","dramat","situat","countri","br","br","thei","sai","conflict","start","becaus","chávez","announc","fire","lot","pdvsa","well","worker","polit","issuesbr","br","thei","sai","anyth","much","tv","interrupt","transmit","chávez","dure","onli","dai","cadena","nacion","kind","confisc","o","privat","tv","signal","minut","durationbr","br","thei","tell","u","anyth","quit","announc","make","gener","en","jefe","luca","rincon","romero","inspector","gener","armi","forc","tradit","support","chávez","even","despit","hi","announc","ministro","de","interior","y","justicia","chávez","return","occup","charg","ministro","del","defensa","equal","defens","secretari","usbr","br","thei","sai","anyth","chávez","order","shoot","pacif","peopl","concentr","claim","electionsbr","br","thei","sai","anyth","peopl","thi","concentr","kill","chávez","support","either","civilian","militari","offici","forcesbr","br","thei","present","fact","wrong","order","order","liebr","br","thei","sai","anyth","venezuelan","civilian","societi","even","claim","elect","order","solv","crisi","chávez","action","order","avoid","electionsbr","br","tell","thi","movi","lot","lie","big","lie"],"filtered2":["chávez","support","either","venezuelan","notvenezuelan","lie","dramat","situat","countri","conflict","start","becaus","chávez","announc","fire","lot","pdvsa","well","worker","polit","issuesbr","anyth","tv","interrupt","transmit","chávez","dure","onli","dai","cadena","nacion","kind","confisc","o","privat","tv","signal","minut","durationbr","tell","u","anyth","quit","announc","make","gener","en","jefe","luca","rincon","romero","inspector","gener","armi","forc","tradit","support","chávez","even","despit","announc","ministro","de","interior","y","justicia","chávez","return","occup","charg","ministro","del","defensa","equal","defens","secretari","usbr","anyth","chávez","order","shoot","pacif","peopl","concentr","claim","electionsbr","anyth","peopl","concentr","kill","chávez","support","either","civilian","militari","offici","forcesbr","present","fact","wrong","order","order","liebr","anyth","venezuelan","civilian","societi","even","claim","elect","order","solv","crisi","chávez","action","order","avoid","electionsbr","tell","lot","lie","big","lie"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,11,20,22,23,25,59,71,72,76,82,90,97,104,112,117,120,122,129,132,172,207,225,239,335,338,391,411,439,459,473,488,551,575,608,650,750,751,756,906,982,984,994,1049,1331,1450,1522,1689,1798,2284,2324,2446,2493,2507,2556,2957,3015,3390,3464,3630,3690,3921,3950,4286,4384,4430,5238,5690,5739,5783,7195],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,11,20,22,23,25,59,71,72,76,82,90,97,104,112,117,120,122,129,132,172,207,225,239,335,338,391,411,439,459,473,488,551,575,608,650,750,751,756,906,982,984,994,1049,1331,145

{"value":"Ridiculous. This movie is actually a vehicle for the Ramtha School of Enlightenment. If you are wondering who the *bleep* Ramtha is: \"Ramtha is a 35,000 year-old spirit-warrior who appeared in J.Z. Knight's kitchen in Tacoma, Washington in 1977. Knight claims that she is Ramtha's channel. She also owns the copyright to Ramtha and conducts sessions in which she pretends to go into a trance and speaks Hollywood's version of Elizabethan English in a guttural, husky voice. She has thousands of followers and has made millions of dollars performing as Ramtha at seminars ($1,000 a crack) and at her Ramtha School of Enlightenment, and from the sales of tapes, books, and accessories (Clark and Gallo 1993). She must have hypnotic powers. Searching for self-fulfillment, otherwise normal people obey her command to spend hours blindfolded in a cold, muddy, doorless maze.\" John Wheeler, one of America's finest theoretical physicists, would roll his eyes about this movie. He has in the recent past criticized parapsychologists for their misuse and misinterpretations of quantum theory. This movie does the same thing as those fools.<br /><br />There is a great review of this movie at Skeptico. I recommend anyone considering watching this movie read it first before contributing to a cult's coffers.<br /><br />http://skeptico.blogs.com/skeptico/2005/04/what_the_bleep_.html I noticed one reviewer here at IMDb say to take this movie with a grain of salt.

{"value":"Wow-this one sucks. I'm gonna sum it up as quickly as possible. <br /><br />A count invites 4 naive sluts back to his castle. A bunch of nothing happens for a long time. Some lame and un-erotic soft-core sex scenes happen. Some girls get their heads cut off (off-screen)-The End.<br /><br />The only things going for this one are the decent looking sets and costumes, some bad dubbing which leads to some unintentionally funny dialogue, and a few brief nudie shots. And believe me-those things are not enough to redeem the 90-minutes of tedium that this film is. In fact-the best part is the tacked on beginning from the distributor that features some slutty goth chicks covered in blood and showing their tits-and again-this is definitely not worth the price of admission for this garbage. As everyone else has noted- the title of the film is completely nonsensical-as there's absolutely no bloodsucking, nor dancing of any sort in the film at all. It may as well have been called 'The Goat-Raper Leads the Circle-Jerk'-and at least then it would have had a better title that also pertains to nothing in the film. An accurate title would have been '90 Minutes of Torture'-another alluring title that would have at least been truthful...for the viewer. Honestly-the trailer that's on the disc shows all the best parts (and i use the term 'best' extremely loosely...) so I highly suggest watching that instead if you're still curious.  I can't imagine

{"value":"Prom Night is about a girl named Donna (Brittany Snow) who is being chased by a psycho killer trying to kill her at her prom night. And by doing so killing her family, friends, and her enemies. <br /><br />Now before I begin let me say have you been tired of PG-13 horror movies that haven't been scary lately. Are you tired of stupid girl dialog 'Oh my god' and talking about girlish things. And are you really tired of girls in relationships and then crying. And the last thing are you tired of the US remaking Asian, Japanese, and Chinese films. That pretty much sums up Prom night but I'm still not done with the review.<br /><br />The only reason to see 'Prom night' is to crack a laugh at the kills. If not, don't see Prom night. You never see the kills an only hear screaming and you see some blood on the wall. And by the way the deaths are repeating like 24/7. So not only aren't they scary but it's obnoxious. By the time I met the cast I think I was ready to hurl. Too much girl talk, too much guy talk, and lots of 'Oh my gosh. It's our prom'. I understand it's fun but seriously is it too much to ask not to concentrate. <br /><br />If I were to put Prom Night on the list of worst films of 2008 without seeing the other films I'd be the first one too. I'm not going to be surprised if it gets released on DVD for cheap and quick. Seriously don't spend your money or the time for dull acting, cheap scares, and a 'Night to die for' when watching the film.<br /><br />1 star out of 10. (P.S.

{"value":"I debated as to whether or not I should tick the spoiler box. Since 99% of this show has probably already been seen by any follower of Scrubs it probably doesn't come under the category of a spoiler.<br /><br />Clip shows. Grrr. We all knew Friends was going down the tube when they started with clip shows...and five and a half years into Scrubs they've gone and fallen down that hole.<br /><br />I have to wonder if the writers just couldn't be bothered writing that week and just said to themselves \"let's show the other funny stuff.\" It didn't work.<br /><br />For starters, showing all the times that people have fallen down isn't funny when taken out of context. It's not funny to see Todd dangling by his banana hammock unless we know WHY he was dangling by his banana hammock.<br /><br />Second, for what was supposed to be a compilation of JD's fantasies, one was Turk's dream, another also wasn't his fantasy, although I forget which.<br /><br />And that's the problem. This episode is totally forgettable. We've seen all these things before. And the collection of clips of people dancing? Why? That's not funny.<br /><br />Finally, I must admit two of my favourite Scrubs moments were shown in the last compilation...Dr. Cox realising that Ben died...and JD telling him how proud of him he is.<br /><br />But even seeing those moments again didn't save the episode.

{"value":"Curiously, it is Rene Russo's eyes and mouth--not Buddy the Gorilla's-- that emerge as the focal point of \"Buddy\", a Jim Henson Pictures production through Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope. Somehow, countless close-ups of Russo's face slipped passed in the post-production stages, and she literally fills the screen so many times the poor apes are upstaged. Unintentionally funny true story adapted from Gertrude \"Trudy\" Davies Lint's memoirs about a wealthy doctor's wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild-life. The movie goes beyond good intentions...it positively drips with earnest sincerity. The movie never sparkles with the kind of \"family film\" magic that it needed, and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed (nothing here feels real). About ten minutes in, two chimpanzees are goofing around in Russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher's knife back and forth (it misses Alan Cumming's head by inches); yet, no eyebrows are raised because it's all in a day's fun. Still, when full-grown gorilla Buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm, the cops are called--and everyone stares at Buddy through the window while he busts up the living room furniture. The furniture should be the least of anyone's worries in this flabbergasting, do-gooder failure. But, at least we know Russo was in good hands: whenever director Caroline Thompson needs a good pick-up shot, she gives unstartled Rene another extreme close-up.

{"value":"I am an avid B-Rate horror film buff and have viewed my fair share of slasher pictures, so I have a substantial gauge to judge this film by. It easily ranks in the upper echelon of the worst horror films the 1980's has to offer. It isn't as scary as Night of the Demons, it isn't as gory as Re-Animator and lacks the camp value of There's Nothing Out There. That being said, this film has no value. Keep in mind, the movie artwork is for a completely different film. The stills shots on the back of the DVD box aren't taken from this film.<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$ (There is plenty of violence but we've seen it all before. A murderer kills nubile students and the occasional facility member by slitting throats and all the other tired methods of murder that horror films utilize).<br /><br />NUDITY: None <br /><br />STORY: $$ (The story focuses on Francine Forbes - who wisely changed her name to Forbes Riley after this film was made - who accepts a job teaching at a university. People start to die and Forbes believes the killer is targeting her. Is it her new heartthrob with a checkered past or the libido-crazed student? To be honest, it is impossible to care because the script doesn't flesh out any character outside Forbes).<br /><br />ACTING: $ (Terrible on all levels. This slasher has the feel of a school production -high school that is because college students could make a better flick than this. Forbes showcases a modicum of talent as does Seminara as one of the students, but everyone else is of the \"extras\" caliber of

{"value":"I am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but I just got back from this movie, and felt I had to express my opinions. Let me start by saying that I am a HUGE horror fan. But what makes a horror movie? I sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. I know they often lack in horror movies, but Prom Night looked like it didn't even put forth ANY effort in that department. Next, we all love suspense. That on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. Yeah, Prom Night had none of that! Of course, we like a terrifying killer. Prom Night have that? Nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife. And when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! Yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated PG-13 like Prom Night, they leave that stuff out too. So with all of these elements missing, I ask....does this still count as a horror movie? Nope. I'd call it more of a comedy. People in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when I saw \"Semi-Pro\" that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). I think I am just going to have to give up on new horror. All the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. The people I went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake! Which made me mad! I wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake???

{"value":"This ambitious film suffers most from writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson's delusions of grandeur. Highly derivative of much better material (Altman's \"Nashville,\" Lumet's \"Network\"), this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere. A couple of misguided detours along the way (an embarrassing musical interlude, a biblical plague) don't help matters. Neither does the uneven level of performances. Especially bad: William H. Macy, whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether; Julianne Moore, for her unconvincing angst. And how many times must we see John C. Reilly's Sad Sack shtick (\"Chicago\" and \"The Hours\" will suffice)? Tom Cruise comes off well by comparison  his misogynist, foul-mouthed Holy Roller was rather amusing. Speaking of foul mouths, the script was so loaded with \"F\" bombs, they lost their impact in no time. Don't even talk about that awful soundtrack, full of insipid and annoying vocals by Aimee Mann. Her extended rendition of \"One,\" a maudlin number to begin with, drove me to distraction at the start of the film. I should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours, by which time I'd been pushed to the brink of hell. One redeeming feature, which I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews, is the best performance in the bunch, by unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia, the damaged coke fiend bent on self-destruction. Her credibility exceeded all others by far.

{"value":"I can't believe I am so angry after seeing this that I am about to write my first ever review on IMDb.<br /><br />This Disney documentary is nothing but a rehashed Planet Earth lite. Now I knew going into this that it was advertised as \"from the people who brought you Planet Earth,\" but I had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini-series. I just paid $8.75 to see something I already own on DVD. Shame on Disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here (save a James Earl Jones voice-over and 90 seconds of sailfish that I don't believe were in Planet Earth).<br /><br />But the biggest crime of all, is that while Planet Earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change, Disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe. After the male polar bear's demise, they show his cubs grown significantly a year later, and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory, and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all. No mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured, no warning of trouble for future generations if we don't get our act together, nothing.

{"value":"I am a big fan of Fred MacMurray and Carole Lombard. And, in addition to them, Charles Butterworth (a very enjoyable supporting actor) was in this film,...so why didn't I particularly enjoy it?! Well, despite a good cast, this is one of the poorest written and most clichéd \"A pictures\" I have ever seen. Given the talent and money spent to make this film, it is shocking how slip-shod the writing was. I knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film I found myself predicting EXACTLY what would happen next--and I was always right! And this isn't because I am some sort of \"movie savant\", but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it. In fact, it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichés all strung together! Also, I found it a bit irritating that Fred mistreated Carole so bad throughout the film and yet, true to convention, she came running to him in the end. Uggh! There is MORE suspense in a Lassie film (\"will he bring people to rescue Timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break?\").<br /><br />Despite the very, very tired and clichéd script, there were a few positives about the film. It was pretty cool seeing Fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film--it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn't eaten, shaved or slept in days. Also, Charles Butterworth's \"prattle\" did provide a few mildly humorous moments. But all this just wasn't enough to make this film look any different than a \"B movie\". It's a shame,...it could have been so much

{"value":"A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski's - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier. 'Ask the Dust' was the first Fante book I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident, masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of. In the novel the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, how he settles for his first sexual experience with a 'wounded' admirer, and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real, with no touching Hollywood ending. The film adaptation stays true to the book for a while, but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism, sickness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is f-ing crazy, and their love never was and never would be the real thing, no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other. This movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock. I can't believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so

{"value":"The most ridiculous thing about this ridiculous movie is its conceit that if one becomes a saint, he or she and his or her family and his or her significant other live forever. Let's forget that in order to become a saint, the saint must be dead, and saints don't have significant others. That, for a millennium, Nick has been the Jolly Elf to Fred's Scrooge is never even hinted at! Open on Nick learning how to make toys, then on Fred learning how to run numbers; Nick giving a sick child a dolly, Fred repossessing the dolly, along with the family farm! After a few more such episodes, morph to present-day Fred venting his spleen at Siblings Anonymous as his fellow losers nod in empathy. There, I just wrote a more cohesive storyline than this idiocy!<br /><br />This Santa, who is one \"ho, ho, ho, ho, ho\" away from a massive coronary, is a neurotic wuss saddled with the Queen of the Harpies, an operation straight out of Mega-Mall Hell, and answers to a Board (huh?) which just gave the Easter Bunny his pink egg. Oh, and his right-hand man is a ditzy blonde in a skin-tight mini-dress and go-go boots. Ho... ho... ho... ho... ho!<br /><br />But what really sent me over the edge was Slam being named #1 on the Naughty List. Shouldn't a Naughty List be reserved for the future Hitlers and Stalins?

{"value":"There's not a drop of sunshine in \"The Sunshine Boys\", which makes the title of this alleged comedy Neil Simon's sole ironic moment. Simon, who adapted the script from his play (which goes uncredited), equates old age with irrational behavior--and, worse, clumsy, galumphing, mean-spirited irrational behavior. Walter Matthau is merciless on us playing an aged vaudeville performer talked into reuniting with former comedy partner George Burns for a television special (it's said they were a team for 43 years, which begs the question \"how long did vaudeville last, anyway?\"). Burns, who won a Supporting Oscar, has the misfortune of coming to the film some thirty minutes in, after which time Matthau has already blasted the material to hell and back. The noisier the movie gets, the less tolerable and watchable it is. Director Herbert Ross only did solid work when he wasn't coupled with one of Neil Simon's screenplays; here, Ross sets up gags like a thudding amateur, hammering away at belligerent routines which fail to pay off (such as semi-incoherent Matthau showing up at a mechanic's garage to audition for a TV commercial). At this point, Matthau was still too young for this role, and he over-compensates by slouching and hollering. It was up to Ross and Simon to tone down the character, to nuance his temperament to give \"The Sunshine Boys\" some sunniness, yet Walter continues to project as if we'd all gone deaf. The picture looks terribly drab and crawls along at a spiritless pace; one loses hope for it early on. *1/2 from

{"value":"When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the bottom 250 movies, I thought it was too harsh but little did I know that the low rating was absolutely correct.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very few laughs and the jokes were stale.<br /><br />Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. Of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.<br /><br />The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour. All these talents, however, cannot help the poor script and the jokes which simply was not funny.<br /><br />The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was OK. I mean, it was not 100% believable but it was OK...nothing great. I just wish that the Wayans brothers had put more effort into developing a script with good jokes rather than trying to shore up their poor script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.<br /><br />Wait for it on cable or television. It really is not worth any amount of money.","finished_norm":["when","i","see","that","imdb","user","rate","thi","movi","the","bottom","movi","i","think","it","be","too","harsh","but","littl","do","i","know","that","the","low","rate","be","absolut","correctbr","br","i","be","a","big","fan","of","the","wayan","brother","i","love","their","scari","movi","and","even","enjoi","white","chick","littl","man","howev","have","veri","few","laugh","and","the","joke","be","stalebr","br","obvious","the","joke","will","revolv","around","marlon","wayan","who","plai","a","grow","midget","that","be","recent","let","out","of","prison","he","and","hi","partner","traci","morgan","steal","a","diamond","mean","for","a","gangster","thing","go","awri","and","the","midget","have","to","place","the","diamond","with","a","unsuspect","coupl","plai","by","shawn","wayan","and","kerri","washington","in","order","to","get","the","diamond","back","the","midget","pretend","to","be","a","abandon","babi","leav","on","the","unsuspect","coupl","doorstep","of","cours","he","be","take","in","and","the","drama","begin","on","quest","for","the","diamondbr","br","the","movi","have","some","actor","and","actress","from","saturdai","night","live","like","molli","shannon","and","rob","schneider","a","good","from","in","live","colour","all","thi","talent","howev","cannot","help","the","poor","script","and","the","joke","which","simpli","be","not","funnybr","br","the","special","effect","to","make","marlon","wayan","to","look","like","a","midget","be","okai","i","mean","it","be","not","believ","but","it","be","oknoth","great","i","just","wish","that","the","wayan","brother","have","put","much","effort","into","develop","a","script","with","good","joke","rather","than","try","to","shore","up","their","poor","script","with","cameo","from","their","famou","comed","actor","and","actressesbr","br","wait","for","it","on","cabl","or","televis","it","realli","be","not","worth","ani","amount","of","monei"],"filtered":["see","imdb","user","rate","thi","movi","bottom","movi","think","harsh","littl","know","low","rate","absolut","correctbr","br","big","fan","wayan","brother","love","scari","movi","even","enjoi","white","chick","littl","man","howev","veri","laugh","joke","stalebr","br","obvious","joke","revolv","around","marlon","wayan","plai","grow","midget","recent","let","prison","hi","partner","traci","morgan","steal","diamond","mean","gangster","thing","go","awri","midget","place","diamond","unsuspect","coupl","plai","shawn","wayan","kerri","washington","order","get","diamond","back","midget","pretend","abandon","babi","leav","unsuspect","coupl","doorstep","cours","take","drama","begin","quest","diamondbr","br","movi","actor","actress","saturdai","night","live","like","molli","shannon","rob","schneider","good","live","colour","thi","talent","howev","help","poor","script","joke","simpli","funnybr","br","special","effect","make","marlon","wayan","look","like","midget","okai","mean","believ","oknoth","great","wish","wayan","brother","put","much","effort","develop","script","good","joke","rather","try","shore","poor","script","cameo","famou","comed","actor","actressesbr","br","wait","cabl","televis","realli","worth","ani","amount","monei"],"filtered2":["see","imdb","user","rate","bottom","think","harsh","littl","know","low","rate","absolut","correctbr","big","fan","wayan","brother","love","scari","even","enjoi","white","chick","littl","man","howev","veri","laugh","joke","stalebr","obvious","joke","revolv","around","marlon","wayan","plai","grow","midget","recent","let","prison","partner","traci","morgan","steal","diamond","mean","gangster","thing","go","awri","midget","place","diamond","unsuspect","coupl","plai","shawn","wayan","kerri","washington","order","get","diamond","back","midget","pretend","abandon","babi","leav","unsuspect","coupl","doorstep","cours","take","drama","begin","quest","diamondbr","actor","actress","saturdai","night","live","like","molli","shannon","rob","schneider","good","live","colour","talent","howev","help","poor","script","joke","simpli","funnybr","special","effect","make","marlon","wayan","look","like","midget","okai","mean","believ","oknoth","great","wish","wayan","brother","put","effort","develop","script","good","joke","rather","try","shore","poor","script","cameo","famou","comed","actor","actressesbr","wait","cabl","televis","realli","worth","ani","amount","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,12,13,14,15,16,26,27,29,31,36,40,41,45,51,54,63,74,77,82,88,91,98,106,113,116,124,126,133,140,146,147,159,160,164,185,191,199,200,201,202,203,210,214,217,219,222,253,276,320,331,341,355,359,381,396,399,401,439,463,561,562,578,591,663,698,771,852,860,865,1041,1199,1371,1486,1500,1514,1533,1553,1682,1707,1796,2014,2042,2297,2329,2334,2378,2412,2487,2511,3085,3093,3277,3598,4182,4625,5264,5491,5828,6610,7215,8420],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"OK, I have watched the original French version. But I can't imagine this being better with subtitles.<br /><br />All I have to say that this is the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. There are almost no redeeming qualities to this film. That's why I can't understand all the positive reviews. It might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are best left untold.<br /><br />I usually like slow paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely slow paced but it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film for example. But in this case, the movie is just filed with mindless dialog that manage to tell us little about the characters. None of which I could identify with or care for. In a lot of the scenes I found myself thinking: \"When are they going to shut up\"? The acting was pretty bad. Not in an overacting obvious kind of way. But It seems none of the actors cared about their characters and they all looked like they wanted to be elsewhere in most of the scenes. This might be due to the uninspired dialog they were given. Also the whole flow of the movie felt quite mechanical. Going from one scene to the next. It seems this movie was just written (badly) but never directed.<br /><br />This is one of the few films that I can say generated no emotional response from any of the scenes. No suspense, no fear, no anticipation, no sorrow, no introspection, no intellectual stimulation, no interest what so ever.<br /><br />A perfect example of what I call an anti-movie.","finished_norm":["okai","i","have","watch","the","origin","french","version","but","i","ca","not","imagin","thi","be","well","with","subtitlesbr","br","all","i","have","to","sai","that","thi","be","the","much","bore","movi","i","have","see","in","a","long","time","there","be","almost","no","redeem","qualiti","to","thi","film","that","why","i","ca","not","understand","all","the","posit","review","it","mai","be","realist","in","a","sens","but","some","real","stori","be","well","leav","untoldbr","br","i","usual","like","slow","pace","movi","a","long","a","it","serv","the","purpos","of","the","movi","tarkovski","solari","be","extrem","slow","pace","but","it","allow","introspect","and","set","the","mood","of","the","film","for","exampl","but","in","thi","case","the","movi","be","just","file","with","mindless","dialog","that","manag","to","tell","u","littl","about","the","charact","none","of","which","i","can","identifi","with","or","care","for","in","a","lot","of","the","scene","i","find","myself","think","when","be","thei","go","to","shut","up","the","act","be","pretti","bad","not","in","a","overact","obviou","kind","of","wai","but","it","seem","none","of","the","actor","care","about","their","charact","and","thei","all","look","like","thei","want","to","be","elsewher","in","much","of","the","scene","thi","mai","be","due","to","the","uninspir","dialog","thei","be","give","conjur","the","whole","flow","of","the","movi","feel","quit","mechan","go","from","on","scene","to","the","next","it","seem","thi","movi","be","just","write","badli","but","never","directedbr","br","thi","be","on","of","the","few","film","that","i","can","sai","gener","no","emot","respons","from","ani","of","the","scene","no","suspens","no","fear","no","anticip","no","sorrow","no","introspect","no","intellectu","stimul","no","interest","what","so","everbr","br","a","perfect","exampl","of","what","i","call","a","antimovi"],"filtered":["okai","watch","origin","french","version","ca","imagin","thi","well","subtitlesbr","br","sai","thi","much","bore","movi","see","long","time","almost","redeem","qualiti","thi","film","ca","understand","posit","review","mai","realist","sens","real","stori","well","leav","untoldbr","br","usual","like","slow","pace","movi","long","serv","purpos","movi","tarkovski","solari","extrem","slow","pace","allow","introspect","set","mood","film","exampl","thi","case","movi","file","mindless","dialog","manag","tell","u","littl","charact","none","identifi","care","lot","scene","find","think","thei","go","shut","act","pretti","bad","overact","obviou","kind","wai","seem","none","actor","care","charact","thei","look","like","thei","want","elsewher","much","scene","thi","mai","due","uninspir","dialog","thei","give","conjur","whole","flow","movi","feel","quit","mechan","go","scene","next","seem","thi","movi","write","badli","never","directedbr","br","thi","film","sai","gener","emot","respons","ani","scene","suspens","fear","anticip","sorrow","introspect","intellectu","stimul","interest","everbr","br","perfect","exampl","call","antimovi"],"filtered2":["okai","watch","origin","french","version","ca","imagin","well","subtitlesbr","bore","see","long","time","almost","redeem","qualiti","ca","understand","posit","review","mai","realist","sens","real","stori","well","leav","untoldbr","usual","like","slow","pace","long","serv","purpos","tarkovski","solari","extrem","slow","pace","allow","introspect","set","mood","exampl","case","file","mindless","dialog","manag","tell","u","littl","charact","none","identifi","care","lot","scene","find","think","go","shut","act","pretti","bad","overact","obviou","kind","wai","seem","none","actor","care","charact","look","like","want","elsewher","scene","mai","due","uninspir","dialog","give","conjur","whole","flow","feel","quit","mechan","go","scene","next","seem","write","badli","never","directedbr","gener","emot","respons","ani","scene","suspens","fear","anticip","sorrow","introspect","intellectu","stimul","interest","everbr","perfect","exampl","call","antimovi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,8,9,10,12,14,16,17,19,20,21,27,30,33,35,37,38,39,41,42,43,46,60,65,69,72,74,78,80,81,90,99,108,109,111,112,120,122,131,142,173,176,191,205,212,220,225,265,288,297,307,319,329,340,345,370,383,390,432,448,506,509,521,529,546,568,634,677,794,812,815,899,915,959,1129,1415,1549,1699,1704,1819,1899,2270,2350,2370,2448,3141,4288,5477,7044,7777],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,8,9,10,12,14,16,17,19,20,21,27,30,33,35,37,38,39,41,42,43,46,60,65,69,72,74,78,80,81,90,99,108,109,111,112,120,122,131,

{"value":"This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while.<br /><br />Heath Ledger is a heartthrob? He looked deformed. I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him. <br /><br />Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob? With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, I can't say I agree.<br /><br />Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set. <br /><br />I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy, which actually WAS an entertaining film. This was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. It didn't.<br /><br />The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. That's not funny. But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I kept waiting for them to say \"I'll bite yer leg off!\" We were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. When we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was.<br /><br />I may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back.","finished_norm":["thi","have","to","be","the","wrong","piec","of","garbag","i","have","see","in","a","whilebr","br","heath","ledger","be","a","heartthrob","he","look","deform","i","wish","i","have","know","that","he","and","naomi","watt","be","a","item","in","real","life","becaus","i","spend","of","the","long","hour","of","my","life","wonder","what","she","see","in","him","br","br","orlando","bloom","be","a","heartthrob","with","the","scraggli","beard","and","deerintheheadlight","look","about","him","i","ca","not","sai","i","agreebr","br","rachel","griffith","be","her","usual","fabul","self","but","geoffrei","rush","look","a","if","he","can","not","wait","to","get","off","the","set","br","br","i","be","suppos","to","feel","sorri","for","bankrobb","and","murder","thi","be","a","far","cry","from","butch","cassidi","which","actual","be","a","entertain","film","thi","be","trite","clicheridden","and","bore","we","onli","stai","becaus","we","be","convinc","it","would","get","well","it","didntbr","br","the","last","minut","or","so","be","unintention","hilari","heath","and","hi","gang","be","hole","up","in","a","frontier","hotel","and","woman","and","child","be","dye","becaus","of","their","presenc","that","not","funni","but","it","be","funni","when","thei","walk","out","of","the","hotel","with","the","armor","on","becaus","all","we","can","think","of","be","the","black","knight","from","monti","python","and","the","holi","grail","i","keep","wait","for","them","to","sai","i","will","bite","yer","leg","off","we","be","howl","with","laughter","a","be","sever","other","warp","member","of","the","audienc","when","we","leav","pretti","much","everyon","be","talk","about","what","a","wast","of","time","thi","film","wasbr","br","i","mai","not","have","pai","cash","to","see","thi","disast","sneak","preview","but","it","certainli","be","not","free","it","cost","me","hour","of","my","life","that","i","will","never","get","back"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","piec","garbag","see","whilebr","br","heath","ledger","heartthrob","look","deform","wish","know","naomi","watt","item","real","life","becaus","spend","long","hour","life","wonder","see","br","br","orlando","bloom","heartthrob","scraggli","beard","deerintheheadlight","look","ca","sai","agreebr","br","rachel","griffith","usual","fabul","self","geoffrei","rush","look","wait","get","set","br","br","suppos","feel","sorri","bankrobb","murder","thi","far","cry","butch","cassidi","actual","entertain","film","thi","trite","clicheridden","bore","onli","stai","becaus","convinc","get","well","didntbr","br","last","minut","unintention","hilari","heath","hi","gang","hole","frontier","hotel","woman","child","dye","becaus","presenc","funni","funni","thei","walk","hotel","armor","becaus","think","black","knight","monti","python","holi","grail","keep","wait","sai","bite","yer","leg","howl","laughter","sever","warp","member","audienc","leav","pretti","much","everyon","talk","wast","time","thi","film","wasbr","br","mai","pai","cash","see","thi","disast","sneak","preview","certainli","free","cost","hour","life","never","get","back"],"filtered2":["wrong","piec","garbag","see","whilebr","heath","ledger","heartthrob","look","deform","wish","know","naomi","watt","item","real","life","becaus","spend","long","hour","life","wonder","see","orlando","bloom","heartthrob","scraggli","beard","deerintheheadlight","look","ca","agreebr","rachel","griffith","usual","fabul","self","geoffrei","rush","look","wait","get","set","suppos","feel","sorri","bankrobb","murder","far","cry","butch","cassidi","actual","entertain","trite","clicheridden","bore","onli","stai","becaus","convinc","get","well","didntbr","last","minut","unintention","hilari","heath","gang","hole","frontier","hotel","woman","child","dye","becaus","presenc","funni","funni","walk","hotel","armor","becaus","think","black","knight","monti","python","holi","grail","keep","wait","bite","yer","leg","howl","laughter","sever","warp","member","audienc","leav","pretti","everyon","talk","wast","time","wasbr","mai","pai","cash","see","disast","sneak","preview","certainli","free","cost","hour","life","never","get","back"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,11,12,16,20,22,25,26,42,43,46,52,59,62,63,70,74,75,78,80,81,89,99,101,108,109,134,144,149,154,168,174,175,180,186,195,218,229,246,265,273,283,294,316,322,331,366,389,399,437,478,618,632,686,702,810,836,856,997,1034,1108,1159,1230,1277,1364,1378,1454,1733,1752,1860,1974,2365,2395,2400,2703,2911,2986,3500,3576,3591,3919,4122,4505,4950,4960,5017,5106,5619,5627,5631,5726,6173,6581,6677,7730,8134,8607],"values":[3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"This movie's heart was in the right place, no matter where its brain was.<br /><br />\"Attack\" is basically a spoof a la \"Airplane!\" (two years before the fact - nice going.) of what happens when vegetables, or in this case fruits, attack.<br /><br />Through all manner of film magic (stop motion, papier-mache tomatoes on skateboards, reverse filming, people watching off-screen tomatoes, people throwing basketball-sized tomatoes at the on-screen actors), the tomatoes do indeed attack everyone in their leafy grasp. <br /><br />Then, it's up to Mason Dixon (Miller) and a group of spies I wouldn't wish on any government's side to save the day. Of course there's a meddling reporter (Taylor) who pops in at the worst times, dancing and singing Army soldiers, Japanese scientists with dubbed-in voices, some guy dragging around a parachute and a samurai sword...and oh yeah, the San Diego Chicken before he made it big.<br /><br />The gags here aren't all that great. In fact, you could probably make up better yourself after watching these. Some of the dialogue is inutterably bad (\"Please pass the ketchup\" - not something to say in front of tomatoes.) and as far as \"Puberty Love\" goes...well, I can't blame the tomatoes for shriveling up on hearing it.<br /><br />What's good about it? Well, I liked the theme song and the beginning credits, and there was a scene with four people on the phone at once that was pretty well executed. ...that's about it.<br /><br />Three stars. Not a \"Killer\" comedy, but it tries.<br /><br />Rock on,
