{"value":"Just Cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out - nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from Ed Harris. Then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you've got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet Sean Connery's wife (a typically mannered and unconvincing Kate Capshaw) and kid (a very young Scarlet Johannsen) in an alligator skinner's shack. <br /><br />The kind of movie that's probably best seen on a plane, and even then only

{"value":"I must be that one guy in America that didn't like this movie. I guess this just wasn't my style or something, I just don't see what's so fascinating about it, this was *barely entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history. <br /><br />It's about a guy that came from nothing, and goes on to become a drug lord. Pretty simple way to describe an entire movie, and that's exactly my feeling about the entire movie. Contrary to what a lot of people think, just because a movie is about mafias/drug trade/criminal groups doesn't automatically make it a great movie, don't forget good storytelling.","finished_norm":["i","must","be","that","on","gui","in","america","that","do","not","like","thi","movi","i","guess","thi","just","be","not","my","styl","or","someth","i","just","do","not","see","what","so","fascin","about","it","thi","be","bare","entertain","let","alon","on","of","the","great","achiev","in","cinema","histori","br","br","it","about","a","gui","that","come","from","noth","and","go","on","to","becom","a","drug","lord","pretti","simpl","wai","to","describ","a","entir","movi","and","that","exactli","my","feel","about","the","entir","movi","contrari","to","what","a","lot","of","peopl","think","just","becaus","a","movi","be","about","mafiasdrug","tradecrimin","group","doe","not","automat","make","it","a","great","movi","do","not","forget","good","storytel"],"filtered":["must","gui","america","like","thi","movi","guess","thi","styl","someth","see","fascin","thi","bare","entertain","let","alon","great","achiev","cinema","histori","br","br","gui","come","noth","go","becom","drug","lord","pretti","simpl","wai","describ","entir","movi","exactli","feel","entir","movi","contrari","lot","peopl","think","becaus","movi","mafiasdrug","tradecrimin","group","doe","automat","make","great","movi","forget","good","storytel"],"filtered2":["must","gui","america","like","guess","styl","someth","see","fascin","bare","entertain","let","alon","great","achiev","cinema","histori","gui","come","noth","go","becom","drug","lord","pretti","simpl","wai","describ","entir","exactli","feel","entir","contrari","lot","peopl","think","becaus","mafiasdrug","tradecrimin","group","doe","automat","make","great","forget","good","storytel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,12,18,22,23,33,34,43,49,51,53,55,72,78,115,124,141,195,198,243,372,380,409,410,457,462,499,594,668,697,736,808,1164,1257,1446,2029,2263,3255],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,12,18,22,23,33,34,43,49,51,53,55,72,78,115,124,141,195,198,243,372,380,409,410,457,462,499,594,668,697,736,808,1164,1257,1446,2029,2263,3255],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.6608112036218214,1.6920303308087352,3.4279798616619646,1.7003182735607676,3.9073995778510735,1.9209463754160525,2.0064197866819473,2.201553588425805,2.2323930368088845,2.2657547357741192,2.51289241584188,5.087945223472195,2.627841366673578,3.0316467233633775,3.102062070196872,3.2209578243390444,3.2070272508030975,3.3243163373261977,3.2639531875991072,3.3814747511661465,3.496027715008137,3.5813614403160887,3.7952092507568174,3.6841709341823097,3.90413483257914,4.268777946167049,4.34596758485818,4.581533656170946,4.979216623837056,5.064116067623542,5.521540914662417]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6717037937823483E-4,2.6693362619818403E-4,2.669995341725061E-4,2.6694585872558986E-4,2.6697112198467953E-4,2.669321544066983E-4,2.6701517401262127E-4,2.668924392557496E-4,2.6693368261187714E-4,2.67209529647822E-4,2.693297644292152E-4,2.6693412351729365E-4,2.6718692700077496E-4,2.672147632688602E-4,2.6709337457905846E-4,2.66946910186691E-4,2.670387502479103E-4,2.671644195916363E-4,2.6696069150467145E-4,2.6695971546989637E-4,2.6719988631598716E-4,2.6698646210793225E-4,2.6698686616880485E-4,2.671579008138561E-4,2.66960787804115E-4,2.6721795714483137E-4,2.670275937076647E-4,2.6693302794454014E-4,2.670540439720468E-4,2.671355527157651E-4,2.669877717197397E-4,2.6713076455619865E-4,2.6726191909272427E-4,2.675099795949207E-4,2.670271322764756E-4,2.669467482791582E-4,2.670429976574585E-4,2.669738592143112E-4,2.668927241139555E-4,2.669606088312896E-4,2.6722814898220585E-4,2.670815575212526E-4,2.671313733011855E-4,2.669060073350437E-4,2.669606767126096E-4,2.6694664789698856E-4,2.6703700691698367E-4,2.6708331146775165E-4,2.6702900158559516E-4,2.6698667701707053E-4,2.6694730803553644E-4,2.6749423971813034E-4,2.6701447966784574E-4,2.6696061552556146E-4,2.6701304970641056E-4,2.669333010533151E-4,0.9789024083327067,2.669749471059822E-4,2.6694768279538996E-4,2.6693314868097954E-4,2.6714670160315275E-4,2.6703946222035824E-4,2.6693303709591457E-4,2.6690589859150086E-4,2.6687905825510764E-4,2.671203591703038E-4,2.669461139524939E-4,2.670674577270922E-4,2.671458352554847E-4,2.670246363885537E-4,2.6696096910605317E-4,2.669062484873482E-4,2.6697452803714597E-4,2.669061047283371E-4,2.6692011152906043E-4,2.669062560414603E-4,2.6707951549918233E-4,2.670000240882532E-4,2.6693339338281126E-4,2.6695925088617543E-4]}}

{"value":"1940. - A visit to the Lodz ghetto in Nazi-occupied Poland, recorded by a German cameramen with the naive co-operation of the Jewish community, is combined with archival footage, clips from international newsreels, and excerpts from related cultural films to portray the World's Jews as swindlers and parasites. This 'documentary' interprets Jewish life from the viewpoint of traditional anti-Semitism and Nazi ideology. A candid, cinematically-unique expression of racial hatred. I personally find this film frightening and highly offensive. One can only hope that such pictures as this will never reach the screen again.","finished_norm":["a","visit","to","the","lodz","ghetto","in","nazioccupi","poland","record","by","a","german","cameraman","with","the","naiv","cooper","of","the","jewish","commun","be","combin","with","archiv","footag","clip","from","intern","newsreel","and","excerpt","from","relat","cultur","film","to","portrai","the","world","jew","a","swindler","and","parasit","thi","documentari","interpret","jewish","life","from","the","viewpoint","of","tradit","antisemit","and","nazi","ideologi","a","candid","cinematicallyuniqu","express","of","racial","hatr","i","person","find","thi","film","frighten","and","highli","offens","on","can","onli","hope","that","such","pictur","a","thi","will","never","reach","the","screen","again"],"filtered":["visit","lodz","ghetto","nazioccupi","poland","record","german","cameraman","naiv","cooper","jewish","commun","combin","archiv","footag","clip","intern","newsreel","excerpt","relat","cultur","film","portrai","world","jew","swindler","parasit","thi","documentari","interpret","jewish","life","viewpoint","tradit","antisemit","nazi","ideologi","candid","cinematicallyuniqu","express","racial","hatr","person","find","thi","film","frighten","highli","offens","onli","hope","pictur","thi","never","reach","screen"],"filtered2":["visit","lodz","ghetto","nazioccupi","poland","record","german","cameraman","naiv","cooper","jewish","commun","combin","archiv","footag","clip","intern","newsreel","excerpt","relat","cultur","portrai","world","jew","swindler","parasit","documentari","interpret","jewish","life","viewpoint","tradit","antisemit","nazi","ideologi","candid","cinematicallyuniqu","express","racial","hatr","person","find","frighten","highli","offens","onli","hope","pictur","never","reach","screen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[11,38,42,75,153,165,181,192,311,469,624,658,846,880,896,903,924,934,968,1020,1061,1145,1167,1381,1450,1563,1710,1934,2016,2075,2285,2319,2727,3061,3460,3660,4495,4538,4996,5045,6664,7616,8065,8388],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[11,38,42,75,153,165,181,192,311,469,624,658,846,880,896,903,924,934,968,1020,1061,1145,1167,1381,1450,1563,1710,1934,2016,2075,2285,2319,2727,3061,3460,3660,4495,4538,4996,5045,6664,7616,8065,8388],"values":[0.9913098153388195,1.519311641348122,1.6219954307453837,1.9742250248702675,2.3409902041158843,2.448847599972298,2.4442286541160034,2.5318267134339894,2.9203338091782562,3.328770687675578,3.9241755834625858,3.813163054373413,3.9201351739255808,4.110553940952155,3.8844878351953436,3.948766986599908,4.339813719283801,3.9405024767500145,3.9911462095687695,4.100845126825194,4.218628162481577,4.2574141875167335,4.2574141875167335,4.449957298382227,4.484804029712395,4.74221603786142,4.688631791727313,5.170884043049248,4.933754249760298,5.0768550934009715,5.390512652256013,10.712052952369687,5.672363804397,5.5623629091826725,5.649374286172302,5.7446844659766265,5.999576715605417,5.967828017290836,6.2980697041614135,6.2980697041614135,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.671703793782347E-4,2.66933626198184E-4,2.6699953417250606E-4,2.6694585872558975E-4,2.669711219846794E-4,2.6693215440669825E-4,2.6701517401262116E-4,2.6689243925574947E-4,2.6693368261187703E-4,2.6720952964782193E-4,2.6932976047606207E-4,2.6693412351729354E-4,2.6718692700077485E-4,2.672147632688601E-4,2.6709337457905835E-4,2.669469101866909E-4,2.6703875024791017E-4,2.671644195916362E-4,2.669606915046714E-4,2.669597154698963E-4,2.671998863159871E-4,2.6698646210793214E-4,2.669868661688048E-4,2.6715790081385603E-4,2.669607878041149E-4,2.672179571448313E-4,2.6702759370766466E-4,2.669330279445401E-4,2.6705404397204673E-4,2.6713555271576497E-4,2.6698777171973965E-4,2.671307645561986E-4,2.672619190927242E-4,2.675099795949206E-4,2.6702713227647556E-4,2.669467482791581E-4,2.6704299765745843E-4,2.6697385921431113E-4,2.668927241139554E-4,2.6696060883128953E-4,2.672281489822058E-4,2.6708155752125254E-4,2.671313733011854E-4,2.669060073350436E-4,2.669606767126095E-4,2.669466478969885E-4,2.670370069169836E-4,2.670833114677516E-4,2.670290015855951E-4,2.669866770170704E-4,2.6694730803553633E-4,2.6749423971813023E-4,2.670144796678457E-4,2.6696061552556135E-4,2.670130497064105E-4,2.66933301053315E-4,0.9789024083366598,2.6697494710598214E-4,2.6694768279538985E-4,2.669331486809795E-4,2.6714670160315264E-4,2.6703946222035813E-4,2.6693303709591446E-4,2.6690589859150075E-4,2.6687905825510753E-4,2.671203591703037E-4,2.669461139524938E-4,2.6706745772709213E-4,2.6714583525548467E-4,2.6702463638855365E-4,2.6696096910605306E-4,2.669062484873481E-4,2.6697452803714586E-4,2.66906104728337E-4,2.669201115290603E-4,2.669062560414602E-4,2.670795154991822E-4,2.6700002408825313E-4,2.669333933828112E-4,2.669592508861753E-4]

{"value":"Annie Potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film. Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the Corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod (quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie), and heads off to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joy.<br /><br />I would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasn't for the fun of watching Annie Potts in a very early role, and it's too bad for Hamill that he didn't take a few acting lessons from her. Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo.","finished_norm":["anni","pott","be","the","onli","highlight","in","thi","truli","dull","film","mark","hamil","plai","a","teenag","who","be","realli","realli","realli","upset","that","someon","steal","the","corvett","he","and","hi","classmat","turn","into","a","hotrod","quit","possibli","the","ugli","look","car","to","be","featur","in","a","movi","and","head","off","to","la","vega","with","anni","to","track","down","the","evil","geniu","who","have","steal","hi","pride","and","joybr","br","i","would","have","pluck","out","my","ey","after","watch","thi","if","it","be","not","for","the","fun","of","watch","anni","pott","in","a","veri","earli","role","and","it","too","bad","for","hamil","that","he","do","not","take","a","few","act","lesson","from","her","danni","bonaduc","conjur","make","a","goofi","cameo"],"filtered":["anni","pott","onli","highlight","thi","truli","dull","film","mark","hamil","plai","teenag","realli","realli","realli","upset","someon","steal","corvett","hi","classmat","turn","hotrod","quit","possibli","ugli","look","car","featur","movi","head","la","vega","anni","track","evil","geniu","steal","hi","pride","joybr","br","pluck","ey","watch","thi","fun","watch","anni","pott","veri","earli","role","bad","hamil","take","act","lesson","danni","bonaduc","conjur","make","goofi","cameo"],"filtered2":["anni","pott","onli","highlight","truli","dull","mark","hamil","plai","teenag","realli","realli","realli","upset","someon","steal","corvett","classmat","turn","hotrod","quit","possibli","ugli","look","car","featur","head","la","vega","anni","track","evil","geniu","steal","pride","joybr","pluck","ey","watch","fun","watch","anni","pott","veri","earli","role","bad","hamil","take","act","lesson","danni","bonaduc","conjur","make","goofi","cameo"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,9,11,13,15,16,21,31,39,40,96,120,128,139,208,259,266,281,284,305,321,342,367,558,578,693,717,766,867,895,1199,1272,1341,1385,1827,1988,2081,2482,2787,2831,5809,7472],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,9,11,13,15,16,21,31,39,40,96,120,128,139,208,259,266,281,284,305,321,342,367,558,578,693,717,766,867,895,1199,1272,1341,1385,1827,1988,2081,2482,2787,2831,5809,7472],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,3.3953824709201923,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.4070669811451506,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,2.0390708128715254,2.2044500422972613,2.3409902041158843,2.2939035841256437,2.6289494000279396,2.7464553122240485,2.747702973022204,2.832333801361687,3.110998680163279,2.8612813773965557,3.09496984188738,2.9705344631698933,3.0791938792932125,3.4572130107926293,7.151261531214208,3.753391311073496,3.7398317812878634,3.9825254665248626,3.8844878351953436,3.9954846111673676,4.291900363587903,4.416284083275639,4.449957298382227,4.403125998698128,4.77960356993304,4.869215728622727,5.129498826886393,16.50521486209871,5.695894301807195,5.501738287366237,6.389041482367141,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.457909248881567E-4,2.455731171235747E-4,2.4563375102320016E-4,2.455843707821269E-4,2.4560761242976685E-4,2.455717631074919E-4,2.456481393351678E-4,2.455352260343834E-4,2.455731690229425E-4,2.4582694228272655E-4,2.4777750751927836E-4,2.4557357464631427E-4,2.458061483401662E-4,2.4583175709999214E-4,2.457200821515687E-4,2.455853381034188E-4,2.4566982895768717E-4,2.4578544201440543E-4,2.455980166155371E-4,2.4559711868482094E-4,2.4581807062765685E-4,2.456217250087547E-4,2.4562209673594925E-4,2.457794448809528E-4,2.455981052089259E-4,2.4583469539626125E-4,2.4565956518386657E-4,2.4557256674326386E-4,2.456838988504996E-4,2.45758885117883E-4,2.456229298230689E-4,2.457544801154606E-4,2.4587513942998096E-4,2.461033496844447E-4,2.456591406772315E-4,2.455851891520181E-4,2.4567373648188076E-4,2.456101306213582E-4,2.4553548809772317E-4,2.4559794055782803E-4,2.4584407166447036E-4,2.457092107159915E-4,2.457550401475783E-4,2.455477083715587E-4,2.4559800300716264E-4,2.455850968026103E-4,2.456682251312382E-4,2.4571082430853577E-4,2.4566086040087173E-4,2.45621922720477E-4,2.4558570411568377E-4,2.460888693409166E-4,2.456475005531106E-4,2.4559794671641215E-4,2.4564618501976245E-4,2.455728179973832E-4,0.9805906755843553,2.4561113145798015E-4,2.4558604888657947E-4,2.455726778181561E-4,2.4576914185124116E-4,2.4567048395681876E-4,2.455725751623288E-4,2.4554760832986986E-4,2.455229158054899E-4,2.4574490738726797E-4,2.4558460558531483E-4,2.4569623921273025E-4,2.457683448302724E-4,2.4565684451475204E-4,2.455982720027567E-4,2.455479302264219E-4,2.4561074592378623E-4,2.4554779797126555E-4,2.455606839225919E-4,2.4554793717604037E-4,2.4570733210020157E-4,2.4563420173500766E-4,2.4557290293850695E-4,2.4559669127792525E-4]}}
{"value":"This show seemed to be kinda good. Kyra Sedgwick is an OK actress and I like police series, but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong. <br /><br />First of all, the writers should have more suspects than one, you know who did it EVERY TIME!!!!! That makes it boring. The main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way. I know they wanted her to be tough, but shes mean, stupid and a bad chief. The crimes are uninteresting and bland, and its just lame all the way.

{"value":"Hm. While an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes, point out atrocious acting, primitive (at best) special effects (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), Severed ranks among the worst I've ever seen. I'm never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor murder scene. All in all, I don't really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable, the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion (which I can't remember anyway).","finished_norm":["hm","while","a","enjoy","movi","to","poke","plot","hole","point","out","atroci","act","primit","at","well","special","effect","all","of","which","have","caus","me","to","view","thi","movi","three","time","over","the","past","six","year","sever","rank","among","the","wrong","i","have","ever","see","i","be","never","sure","who","the","protagonist","be","all","i","know","be","that","the","killer","us","a","portabl","guillotin","a","see","in","the","danc","floor","murder","scene","all","in","all","i","do","not","realli","like","the","movi","becaus","onli","the","minut","be","enjoy","the","rest","be","a","mishmash","of","confus","dialog","and","imageri","that","fail","to","progress","the","stori","to","a","logic","conclus","which","i","ca","not","rememb","anywai"],"filtered":["hm","enjoy","movi","poke","plot","hole","point","atroci","act","primit","well","special","effect","caus","view","thi","movi","three","time","past","six","year","sever","rank","among","wrong","ever","see","never","sure","protagonist","know","killer","us","portabl","guillotin","see","danc","floor","murder","scene","realli","like","movi","becaus","onli","minut","enjoy","rest","mishmash","confus","dialog","imageri","fail","progress","stori","logic","conclus","ca","rememb","anywai"],"filtered2":["hm","enjoy","poke","plot","hole","point","atroci","act","primit","well","special","effect","caus","view","three","time","past","six","year","sever","rank","among","wrong","ever","see","never","sure","protagonist","know","killer","us","portabl","guillotin","see","danc","floor","murder","scene","realli","like","becaus","onli","minut","enjoy","rest","mishmash","confus","dialog","imageri","fail","progress","stori","logic","conclus","ca","rememb","anywai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,11,13,17,19,20,21,22,25,26,32,42,44,56,57,59,66,81,106,119,203,215,224,226,252,273,290,312,316,386,427,432,440,452,492,737,810,826,956,973,1219,1237,1281,1348,1504,1655,2578,3046,4126,4165],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,8,11,13,17,19,20,21,22,25,26,32,42,44,56,57,59,66,81,106,119,203,215,224,226,252,273,290,312,316,386,427,432,440,452,492,737,810,826,956,973,1219,1237,1281,1348,1504,1655,2578,3046,4126,4165],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,1.8693254449200722,1.929723173391612,1.949757232424728,2.159084361316692,2.1653408989309972,2.569760528637609,2.605934685587711,2.689504733779216,2.5940874818617203,3.0433232530252132,2.9674191958529437,2.8612813773965557,2.8824835850471584,2.878207028279898,3.0433232530252132,3.233054746047873,3.235085203598255,3.212973749990824,3.2872346624216657,3.6016814428070463,7.36198256252986,3.8425769395797067,3.8204358137024927,3.969732115064953,4.072271754381138,4.246178114249808,4.429617614145104,4.34596758485818,4.470719289830655,4.566029469634981,4.637773374493822,5.373120909544144,5.463272006538442,5.878215858601149,5.907203395474402]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.234407602816466E-4,2.2324275812784212E-4,2.2329787848933362E-4,2.232529884731E-4,2.2327411672029316E-4,2.232415272346222E-4,2.23310958448924E-4,2.2320831253640848E-4,2.2324280530791688E-4,2.2347350255652807E-4,2.2524670195903744E-4,2.2324317404730224E-4,2.2345459944065E-4,2.2347787955470622E-4,2.233763593891773E-4,2.232538678343091E-4,2.2333067579914003E-4,2.2343577597443485E-4,2.232653934689038E-4,2.2326457718847365E-4,2.234654376153402E-4,2.232869460197476E-4,2.2328728394518973E-4,2.2343032416998444E-4,2.232654740063531E-4,2.234805506669639E-4,2.233213453268011E-4,2.2324225779449925E-4,2.2334346629394172E-4,2.2341163393927875E-4,2.2328804127835604E-4,2.234076294908202E-4,2.2351731705956893E-4,2.2372477578809868E-4,2.2332095942123793E-4,2.2325373242729915E-4,2.2333422800586628E-4,2.2327640592866794E-4,2.2320855076990673E-4,2.232653243272447E-4,2.2348907433600583E-4,2.2336647651074383E-4,2.2340813859831555E-4,2.2321965983456367E-4,2.2326538109796075E-4,2.232536484753717E-4,2.2332921781121275E-4,2.233679433767196E-4,2.2332252276763826E-4,2.2328712575322467E-4,2.2325420056448943E-4,2.2371161216552582E-4,2.233103777523479E-4,2.2326532992581887E-4,2.2330918184256557E-4,2.2324248620167692E-4,0.9823555967068356,2.232773157576042E-4,2.2325451398481238E-4,2.232423587691727E-4,2.2342095801135587E-4,2.2333127123814583E-4,2.2324226544800506E-4,2.2321956888982666E-4,2.2319712169645186E-4,2.2339892722621744E-4,2.2325320192525595E-4,2.2335468452716262E-4,2.2342023346478727E-4,2.2331887205251035E-4,2.2326562563

{"value":"I'm sorry but this is just awful. I have told people about this film and some of the bad acting that is in it and they almost don't believe me. There is nothing wrong with the idea, modern day Japanese troops get pulled back in time to the days of Busido warriors and with their modern weapons are a match for almost everything. When the troops first realise something strange is happening does every single person in the back of the transport need to say \"Hey my watch has stopped\"? Imagine lines like that being repeated 15+ times before they say anything else and you have the movie's lack of greatness in a

{"value":"Few films have left me with such a feeling of unease, and this is not a compliment. Since I saw it in a theater (How it ended there I can only wonder) I was subjected to 90 mn of hateful, derivative garbage, the main impression being a bit like this other sick-o movie \"Don't answer the phone\" - but worse. The nastiness of it all, rape and all, is shown without any distance (unlike strong stuff like \"Last house on the left\") and utter contempt for the (perfect ?) victims and everybody involved, leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur.

{"value":"This movie is a bad attempt to make original fans feel complete. The one thing people have forgotten is the fact that the reason the original won such acclaim, was strictly do to the fact that it was supposed to make you feel incomplete.<br /><br />This movie makes me want to go to the washroom. I am not a negative type of guy, but man the acting in this flick is.... no comment. The plot was a bad reflection of the life of Carlito Brigante and I am sorry to have had two hours of my time and my money wasted on this flick. I still love the original and will do my best not to let this movie ruin my opinion about it.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","a","bad","attempt","to","make","origin","fan","feel","complet","the","on","thing","peopl","have","forget","be","the","fact","that","the","reason","the","origin","win","such","acclaim","be","strictli","do","to","the","fact","that","it","be","suppos","to","make","you","feel","incompletebr","br","thi","movi","make","me","want","to","go","to","the","washroom","i","be","not","a","neg","typ","of","gui","but","man","the","act","in","thi","flick","be","no","comment","the","plot","be","a","bad","reflect","of","the","life","of","carlito","brigant","and","i","be","sorri","to","have","have","two","hour","of","my","time","and","my","monei","wast","on","thi","flick","i","still","love","the","origin","and","will","do","my","well","not","to","let","thi","movi","ruin","my","opinion","about","it"],"filtered":["thi","movi","bad","attempt","make","origin","fan","feel","complet","thing","peopl","forget","fact","reason","origin","win","acclaim","strictli","fact","suppos","make","feel","incompletebr","br","thi","movi","make","want","go","washroom","neg","typ","gui","man","act","thi","flick","comment","plot","bad","reflect","life","carlito","brigant","sorri","two","hour","time","monei","wast","thi","flick","still","love","origin","well","let","thi","movi","ruin","opinion"],"filtered2":["bad","attempt","make","origin","fan","feel","complet","thing","peopl","forget","fact","reason","origin","win","acclaim","strictli","fact","suppos","make","feel","incompletebr","make","want","go","washroom","neg","typ","gui","man","act","flick","comment","plot","bad","reflect","life","carlito","brigant","sorri","two","hour","time","monei","wast","flick","still","love","origin","well","let","ruin","opinion"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,8,9,20,21,23,29,32,37,43,45,47,54,55,64,69,75,89,95,97,103,124,126,140,149,174,177,257,280,372,384,437,489,538,710,1147,1842,2335,2719,3338],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,8,9,20,21,23,29,32,37,43,45,47,54,55,64,69,75,89,95,97,103,124,126,140,149,174,177,257,280,372,384,437,489,538,710,1147,1842,2335,2719,3338],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,3.321622407243643,1.8162961064622165,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,1.9536997889255368,1.883428577602134,6.381097563453174,1.9742250248702675,1.9940046109572438,2.0323326556775485,4.109111584924517,2.098582041218749,2.2323930368088845,2.2391270689902285,2.317169775997098,2.3253197803590226,2.456282578459816,2.458149992634611,5.520531904645819,2.8028805344481915,3.0316467233633775,3.109204957709252,3.1952392950510555,3.3956930001684253,3.43462735814388,3.6528204042982337,4.246178114249808,4.828393734102471,5.0768550934009715,6.2980697041614135,5.583416318380505]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.457909248881567E-4,2.455731171235747E-4,2.456337510232002E-4,2.455843707821269E-4,2.456076124297669E-4,2.4557176310749195E-4,2.456481393351678E-4,2.4553522603438344E-4,2.455731690229426E-4,2.458269422827266E-4,2.47777507519279E-4,2.455735746463143E-4,2.458061483401662E-4,2.458317570999922E-4,2.4572008215156875E-4,2.4558533810341884E-4,2.4566982895768717E-4,2.457854420144055E-4,2.4559801661553715E-4,2.45597118684821E-4,2.4581807062765685E-4,2.456217250087547E-4,2.4562209673594925E-4,2.4577944488095283E-4,2.455981052089259E-4,2.4583469539626125E-4,2.4565956518386657E-4,2.4557256674326386E-4,2.456838988504996E-4,2.45758885117883E-4,2.456229298230689E-4,2.4575448011546067E-4,2.4587513942998096E-4,2.4610334968444477E-4,2.4565914067723154E-4,2.4558518915201815E-4,2.456737364818808E-4,2.4561013062135824E-4,2.4553548809772317E-4,2.4559794055782803E-4,2.458440716644704E-4,2.4570921071599157E-4,2.457550401475783E-4,2.4554770837155877E-4,2.455980030071627E-4,2.4558509680261035E-4,2.456682251312382E-4,2.4571082430853577E-4,2.456608604008718E-4,2.456219227204771E-4,2.4558570411568377E-4,2.4608886934091663E-4,2.456475005531106E-4,2.455979467164122E-4,2.456461850197625E-4,2.455728179973832E-4,0.9805906755843553,2.456111314579802E-4,2.455860488865795E-4,2.4557267781815615E-4,2.457691418512412E-4,2.4567048395681876E-4,2.4557257516232884E-4,2.4554760832986986E-4,2.455229158054899E-4,2.45744907387268E-4,2.455846055853149E-4,2.4569623921273025E-4,2.4576834483027246E-4,2.456568445147521E-4,2.455982720027568E-4,2.4554793022642197E-4,2.456107459237863E-4,2.4554779797126555E-4,2.455606839225919E-4,2.4554793717604037E-4,2.457073321002016E-4,2.4563420173500766E-4,2.45572902938507E-4,2.455966912779253E-4]}}
{"value":"Okay I saw the sneak preview of this stupid movie. First off the movie is so posed and not real, they are all acting. They can't sing. They are way too full of themselves. Its awful. Yes kids like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid. I mean they say their manager is a kid. And there record label is fake. Its stupid. Don't see it.<br /><br />As for the set up and directing, not so bad. It is a cute documentary but it documents a stupid thing. <br /><br />Only see this if you don't really like good music. Also, it's very corny. It's not even tasteful.

{"value":"The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is bad film in every way. The script, the dreary pace, the lack of depth in any character, the pointless sub-plots, the dreadful acting, the needless climax all make this possibly the worst film I've ever seen. I found nothing likable, enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in any way.<br /><br />I imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark, with its moody lighting, long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack. If so, they failed utterly. It just bored me, and I wish I had never watched it.<br /><br />Avoid at all

{"value":"This should be re-titled \"The Curious Case Of The Unscrupulous Filmmakers Who Misrepresented A Non-horror Snorer As A Shock Film.\" It's one long, boring tale of a fraternity hazing, a gag so transparent that even Flounder from Delta House could see through it. Jeff East, an actor in the dues-paying stage, can be forgiven for taking any work he could get. The same can't be said for Charles Martin Smith, who formerly acted for such cinematic heavyweights as George Lucas and Sam Peckinpah. Once available on tape but, thankfully, not out on DVD. Misrepresented garbage like this belongs in a landfill and nowhere else.","finished_norm":["thi","should","be","retitl","the","curiou","case","of","the","unscrupul","filmmak","who","misrepres","a","nonhorror","snorer","a","a","shock","film","it","on","long","bore","tale","of","a","fratern","haze","a","gag","so","transpar","that","even","flounder","from","delta","hous","can","see","through","it","jeff","east","a","actor","in","the","duespai","stage","can","be","forgiv","for","take","ani","work","he","can","get","the","same","ca","not","be","sai","for","charl","martin","smith","who","formerli","act","for","such","cinemat","heavyweight","a","georg","luca","and","sam","peckinpah","onc","avail","on","tape","but","thankfulli","not","out","on","dvd","misrepres","garbag","like","thi","belong","in","a","landfil","and","nowher","els"],"filtered":["thi","retitl","curiou","case","unscrupul","filmmak","misrepres","nonhorror","snorer","shock","film","long","bore","tale","fratern","haze","gag","transpar","even","flounder","delta","hous","see","jeff","east","actor","duespai","stage","forgiv","take","ani","work","get","ca","sai","charl","martin","smith","formerli","act","cinemat","heavyweight","georg","luca","sam","peckinpah","onc","avail","tape","thankfulli","dvd","misrepres","garbag","like","thi","belong","landfil","nowher","els"],"filtered2":["retitl","curiou","case","unscrupul","filmmak","misrepres","nonhorror","snorer","shock","long","bore","tale","fratern","haze","gag","transpar","even","flounder","delta","hous","see","jeff","east","actor","duespai","stage","forgiv","take","ani","work","get","ca","charl","martin","smith","formerli","act","cinemat","heavyweight","georg","luca","sam","peckinpah","onc","avail","tape","thankfulli","dvd","misrepres","garbag","like","belong","landfil","nowher","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,21,27,31,41,48,81,99,108,196,213,236,247,288,323,508,669,680,702,799,820,998,1058,1093,1224,1233,1311,1403,1528,1540,1586,1596,1869,2504,2580,3921,4124,4621,5753,6453,6635,6913,8055],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,21,27,31,41,48,81,99,108,196,213,236,247,288,323,508,669,680,702,799,820,998,1058,1093,1224,1233,1311,1403,1528,1540,1586,1596,1869,2504,2580,3921,4124,4621,5753,6453,6635,6913,8055],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.949757232424728,2.056430207256609,2.138507503627933,2.478925055209576,2.8432628718938773,2.617923930016232,2.7303758068497004,2.8015621426949333,3.0433232530252132,3.4149707055943286,3.7099788181381825,3.8095464139032247,3.6466665387238555,3.7636829971100436,3.900174431363043,4.135246553542527,4.589376833631972,4.150360191352575,4.5432147918688095,4.470719289830655,4.456830177669989,4.550761997504193,4.848596441419991,4.528289141652134,4.589376833631972,4.613282354485526,4.979216623837056,5.156897801074508,5.339219357868463,6.1754673820690815,5.850044981634453,6.600350576034347,6.389041482367141,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.614842553485934E-4,2.612525409305091E-4,2.6131704620099323E-4,2.612645131159257E-4,2.61289238703044E-4,2.612511004628137E-4,2.613323531820882E-4,2.6121223056003453E-4,2.6125259614356286E-4,2.6152257239224746E-4,2.6359767788534363E-4,2.6125302766529364E-4,2.6150045079199457E-4,2.615276946273662E-4,2.614088894243552E-4,2.612655421990288E-4,2.6135542764993457E-4,2.6147842240272423E-4,2.6127903021247635E-4,2.6127807495041863E-4,2.615131342971645E-4,2.6130425234607965E-4,2.6130464780742025E-4,2.614720423625506E-4,2.612791244624016E-4,2.6153082052883005E-4,2.613445085516979E-4,2.6125195540935606E-4,2.613703958813555E-4,2.614501698937485E-4,2.613055340857286E-4,2.6144548363945033E-4,2.6157384684497785E-4,2.6181662793414343E-4,2.6134405694103966E-4,2.612653837373357E-4,2.613595846628694E-4,2.6129191767686443E-4,2.6121250935567063E-4,2.612789492986125E-4,2.615407954557389E-4,2.6139732386619733E-4,2.614460794286615E-4,2.612255098731043E-4,2.6127901573523045E-4,2.6126528549157607E-4,2.61353721421908E-4,2.613990404838676E-4,2.613458864660951E-4,2.6130446268135755E-4,2.6126593158055125E-4,2.6180122304543014E-4,2.6133167361488843E-4,2.612789558504117E-4,2.6133027408698444E-4,2.6125222270562153E-4,0.979351423393872,2.6129298241519416E-4,2.612662983644794E-4,2.612520735761904E-4,2.614610815020013E-4,2.613561244696412E-4,2.612519643659639E-4,2.6122540344392456E-4,2.611991343440662E-4,2.614352997089238E-4,2.6126476291089585E-4,2.6138352415462304E-4,2.6146023359260596E-4,2.6134161417251043E-4,2.6127930190573344E-4,2.612257458930213E-4,2.612925722653009E-4,2.6122560519359925E-4,2.6123931389089377E-4,2.6122575328636104E-4,2.6139532530400003E-4,2.6131752568997924E-4,2.61252313

{"value":"I being of Puertorican descent, had mixed fillings about this \"documentary\". First I was offended that Ms. Perez compared Senor Campos to Che Guevarra. Also just a point of fact,Mr. John Leguzaimo is not of Puertorican descent.His parents came from Columbia. Whomever did research on this was not very accurate. I feel that the future of our race rests on education. This message should have been resounding throughout this film, Education is our road to freedom and power I think any future endeavors of this production team should make this their focus.In my opinion,this film swayed toward an anti-American sentiment.","finished_norm":["i","be","of","puertorican","descent","have","mix","fill","about","thi","documentari","i","be","offend","that","m","perez","compar","senor","campo","to","che","guevarra","conjur","just","a","point","of","factmr","john","leguzaimo","be","not","of","puertorican","descenthi","parent","come","from","columbia","whomev","do","research","on","thi","be","not","veri","accur","i","feel","that","the","futur","of","our","race","rest","on","educ","thi","messag","should","have","be","resound","throughout","thi","film","educ","be","our","road","to","freedom","and","power","i","think","ani","futur","endeavor","of","thi","product","team","should","make","thi","their","focusin","my","opinionthi","film","swai","toward","a","antiamerican","sentim"],"filtered":["puertorican","descent","mix","fill","thi","documentari","offend","m","perez","compar","senor","campo","che","guevarra","conjur","point","factmr","john","leguzaimo","puertorican","descenthi","parent","come","columbia","whomev","research","thi","veri","accur","feel","futur","race","rest","educ","thi","messag","resound","throughout","thi","film","educ","road","freedom","power","think","ani","futur","endeavor","thi","product","team","make","thi","focusin","opinionthi","film","swai","toward","antiamerican","sentim"],"filtered2":["puertorican","descent","mix","fill","documentari","offend","m","perez","compar","senor","campo","che","guevarra","conjur","point","factmr","john","leguzaimo","puertorican","descenthi","parent","come","columbia","whomev","research","veri","accur","feel","futur","race","rest","educ","messag","resound","throughout","educ","road","freedom","power","think","ani","futur","endeavor","product","team","make","focusin","opinionthi","swai","toward","antiamerican","sentim"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,12,15,27,34,39,43,66,190,226,291,365,438,482,553,563,569,624,670,723,782,844,1080,1123,1179,1221,1601,1630,1719,2654,3074,3718,3765,4994,6135,6319,6891,7236],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,12,15,27,34,39,43,66,190,226,291,365,438,482,553,563,569,624,670,723,782,844,1080,1123,1179,1221,1601,1630,1719,2654,3074,3718,3765,4994,6135,6319,6891,7236],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.3002700588679295,1.3982850089458962,1.5538940054862738,1.6608112036218214,1.929723173391612,2.558331832813986,2.5940874818617203,3.016831637578237,3.185521045582134,3.1797351085150902,3.3154667220492153,3.454678155189441,3.459754308221302,3.6436037491933098,3.9241755834625858,3.7264536553416874,3.865219416329466,3.7568101178222815,7.738087025535739,4.229557233013768,4.390138803171316,4.390138803171316,4.470719289830655,4.613282354485526,4.679973728984199,9.48443207572284,6.725513718988353,5.501738287366237,5.822646007446338,5.7959777603641776,6.255510089742618,6.437831646536572,6.600350576034347,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.9976296075729633E-4,2.994973256431572E-4,2.995712738464209E-4,2.9951105043795386E-4,2.9953939560615974E-4,2.9949567430525664E-4,2.995888216179575E-4,2.9945111423365357E-4,2.9949738893885527E-4,2.998068870366736E-4,3.021857674234295E-4,2.994978836310939E-4,2.99781527053222E-4,2.9981275911628643E-4,2.9967656200812604E-4,2.9951223016863186E-4,2.9961527395938175E-4,2.9975627392591774E-4,2.995276926936714E-4,2.995265975907088E-4,2.997960672979395E-4,2.995566070978502E-4,2.9955706045081465E-4,2.9974895991104655E-4,2.995278007408523E-4,2.998163426187676E-4,2.99602756413299E-4,2.9949665440750606E-4,2.996324333916468E-4,2.9972388552942296E-4,2.995580764714902E-4,2.997185132539052E-4,2.9986566756149406E-4,3.001439893977635E-4,2.996022386913129E-4,2.9951204850971625E-4,2.996200395178418E-4,2.9954246675521664E-4,2.994514338422097E-4,2.995275999348193E-4,2.998277777761906E-4,2.996633033667918E-4,2.9971919626075656E-4,2.9946633750664684E-4,2.995276760971001E-4,2.995119358817504E-4,2.996133179564695E-4,2.996652712802887E-4,2.99604336040718E-4,2.995568482241298E-4,2.995126765517531E-4,3.0012632938590284E-4,2.9958804256884975E-4,2.99527607445737E-4,2.9958643816392063E-4,2.9949696083329764E-4,0.9763286762691502,2.9954368736069336E-4,2.995130970292159E-4,2.994967898727947E-4,2.997363944890623E-4,2.9961607278659256E-4,2.994966646752726E-4,2.994662154972892E-4,2.9943610086136406E-4,2.9970683849680477E-4,2.9951133680043387E-4,2.9964748351410663E-4,2.9973542245412857E-4,2.9959943832566266E-4,2.9952800416013065E-4,2.9946660807754233E-4,2.995432171689176E-4,2.9946644678111826E-4,2.9948216229593445E-4,2.994666165531937E-4,2.996610122348813E-4,2.9957182352784596E-4,2.994970644262304E-4,2.99526076331608E-4]}}
{"value":"After seeing the credits with only one name that I recognize and that was the preacher in this film (Russ Conway), I did not expect much from this film and I was not disappointed. A man is planning on killing his new wife by convincing other people that she is insane and will take her own life. Unbeknown to the husband is that the plastic looking skull that he uses, in contrast, a ghost of a woman apparently his first dead wife has revenge on her mind and uses a real skull. A simple plot with a twist of irony at the end. If you are tired late one night and in need of sleep, this will help you to sleep that sleep.","finished_norm":["after","see","the","credit","with","onli","on","name","that","i","recogn","and","that","be","the","preacher","in","thi","film","russ","conwai","i","do","not","expect","much","from","thi","film","and","i","be","not","disappoint","a","man","be","plan","on","kill","hi","new","wife","by","convinc","other","peopl","that","she","be","insan","and","will","take","her","own","life","unbeknown","to","the","husband","be","that","the","plastic","look","skull","that","he","us","in","contrast","a","ghost","of","a","woman","appar","hi","dead","wife","have","reveng","on","her","mind","and","us","a","real","skull","a","simpl","plot","with","a","twist","of","ironi","at","the","end","if","you","be","tire","late","on","night","and","in","ne","of","sleep","thi","will","help","you","to","sleep","that","sleep"],"filtered":["see","credit","onli","name","recogn","preacher","thi","film","russ","conwai","expect","much","thi","film","disappoint","man","plan","kill","hi","new","wife","convinc","peopl","insan","take","life","unbeknown","husband","plastic","look","skull","us","contrast","ghost","woman","appar","hi","dead","wife","reveng","mind","us","real","skull","simpl","plot","twist","ironi","end","tire","late","night","ne","sleep","thi","help","sleep","sleep"],"filtered2":["see","credit","onli","name","recogn","preacher","russ","conwai","expect","disappoint","man","plan","kill","new","wife","convinc","peopl","insan","take","life","unbeknown","husband","plastic","look","skull","us","contrast","ghost","woman","appar","dead","wife","reveng","mind","us","real","skull","simpl","plot","twist","ironi","end","tire","late","night","ne","sleep","help","sleep","sleep"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,11,16,23,24,31,32,45,56,70,75,76,80,87,110,130,143,150,185,187,210,228,238,263,308,356,435,478,536,581,727,732,736,871,900,1285,1568,1738,2383,2499,2660,5143,5183],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,11,16,23,24,31,32,45,56,70,75,76,80,87,110,130,143,150,185,187,210,228,238,263,308,356,435,478,536,581,727,732,736,871,900,1285,1568,1738,2383,2499,2660,5143,5183],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.8162961064622165,3.7221218701403576,2.094675786251684,1.9742250248702675,2.1337665533324026,1.9951803900462557,2.115024371522662,2.1290479736304078,2.2642139034199635,2.3409902041158843,2.332712011146513,2.518833027372001,2.4732161909892554,2.687151791517189,2.7742700004069256,2.597304642813496,5.805372584729356,2.8753661172782943,3.028335462059722,3.2829611516442836,3.3243163373261977,3.6254214301101193,3.530930586689197,4.096025840389245,11.129936454414548,3.6841709341823097,3.9954846111673676,3.9201351739255808,4.449957298382227,4.597282013139085,4.760735085628657,5.102830579804232,11.083487243959873,5.290429193699031,6.389041482367141,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.508084609727827E-4,2.50586206915813E-4,2.506480785860334E-4,2.505976903047261E-4,2.506214064035923E-4,2.505848252590655E-4,2.5066276061866844E-4,2.5054754232407123E-4,2.505862598746462E-4,2.50845213620605E-4,2.528355973796034E-4,2.5058667377834764E-4,2.5082399519387306E-4,2.5085012672676954E-4,2.5073617206405755E-4,2.5059867737275797E-4,2.5068489300962484E-4,2.508028661725358E-4,2.506116147019668E-4,2.5061069844103863E-4,2.508361608610073E-4,2.506358070744791E-4,2.5063618639005236E-4,2.5079674661457335E-4,2.5061170510388666E-4,2.508531250049422E-4,2.506744197127898E-4,2.505856453001278E-4,2.5069925012294764E-4,2.507757671478341E-4,2.5063703648367736E-4,2.5077127222240656E-4,2.5089439465660805E-4,2.511272635582012E-4,2.506739865403451E-4,2.5059852538068757E-4,2.506888803013837E-4,2.506239760011384E-4,2.5054780973712945E-4,2.50611537091628E-4,2.5086269267877016E-4,2.507250787007573E-4,2.507718436869291E-4,2.5056027947365357E-4,2.506116008157932E-4,2.505984311460739E-4,2.506832564429228E-4,2.507267252329181E-4,2.506757413701449E-4,2.506360088222565E-4,2.50599050856738E-4,2.511124876152884E-4,2.506621087966179E-4,2.506115433759325E-4,2.5066076640818533E-4,2.50585901683308E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.506249972686769E-4,2.5059940266573084E-4,2.505857586424849E-4,2.5078623326048387E-4,2.506855613798025E-4,2.5058565389105816E-4,2.5056017738972984E-4,2.505349807961612E-4,2.5076150407809286E-4,2.5059792990114824E-4,2.5071184239933186E-4,2.507854199692583E-4,2.5067164350437717E-4,2.506118753026197E-4,2.50560505857426E-4,2.5062460386425045E-4,2.5056037090243424E-4,2.505735199054815E-4,2.5056051294891277E-4,2.5072316173520927E-4,2.5064853849859865E-4,2.505859883584061E-4,2.506102623091279E-4]}}
{"value":"Five minutes into this movie you realize that you have seen it all before. It is BOILER ROOM. It is THE FIRM. And it is THE DEVILS ADVOCATE. And there are NO new elements here. Except for the all-to-clear Bill Gates-allegory. Conpsiracies are always good stuff for movie-making, but why does it have to be so extreme ? Boiler room is a good movie, because it - for a while at least - seems realistic. In Antitrust everything is wrong. How realistic is it for example that your boss pay an impostor to be your girlfriend in order to make you work harder and control you ? I'd give it 1, but the soundtrack is OK, so 2/10.","finished_norm":["five","minut","into","thi","movi","you","realiz","that","you","have","see","it","all","befor","it","be","boiler","room","it","be","the","firm","and","it","be","the","devil","advoc","and","there","be","no","new","elem","here","except","for","the","alltoclear","bill","gatesallegori","conpsiraci","be","alwai","good","stuff","for","moviemak","but","why","doe","it","have","to","be","so","extrem","boiler","room","be","a","good","movi","becaus","it","for","a","while","at","littl","seem","realist","in","antitrust","everyth","be","wrong","how","realist","be","it","for","exampl","that","your","boss","pai","a","impostor","to","be","your","girlfriend","in","order","to","make","you","work","hard","and","control","you","i","have","give","it","but","the","soundtrack","be","okai","so"],"filtered":["five","minut","thi","movi","realiz","see","befor","boiler","room","firm","devil","advoc","new","elem","except","alltoclear","bill","gatesallegori","conpsiraci","alwai","good","stuff","moviemak","doe","extrem","boiler","room","good","movi","becaus","littl","seem","realist","antitrust","everyth","wrong","realist","exampl","boss","pai","impostor","girlfriend","order","make","work","hard","control","give","soundtrack","okai"],"filtered2":["five","minut","realiz","see","befor","boiler","room","firm","devil","advoc","new","elem","except","alltoclear","bill","gatesallegori","conpsiraci","alwai","good","stuff","moviemak","doe","extrem","boiler","room","good","becaus","littl","seem","realist","antitrust","everyth","wrong","realist","exampl","boss","pai","impostor","girlfriend","order","make","work","hard","control","give","soundtrack","okai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,14,18,22,25,30,35,48,59,79,87,171,191,193,197,232,307,322,329,361,405,439,479,504,513,722,730,796,824,959,1251,1411,3768,4587,7744],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,14,18,22,25,30,35,48,59,79,87,171,191,193,197,232,307,322,329,361,405,439,479,504,513,722,730,796,824,959,1251,1411,3768,4587,7744],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.6955116224012472,1.8693254449200722,1.9469506069506084,2.115024371522662,2.373087554090762,2.5460113484259455,2.517840471459249,2.558331832813986,2.6102777977348763,2.8767855639325206,2.885344817328191,2.951986790814132,3.0399731661399314,3.109204957709252,3.2872346624216657,3.360519385990158,3.3956930001684253,6.909356310378882,3.850067611308864,3.767137231978131,3.850067611308864,3.9081109809587793,8.135175810137424,4.499089986959872,4.715065048795469,5.967828017290836,5.999576715605417,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.9976296075729617E-4,2.9949732564315705E-4,2.9957127384642074E-4,2.995110504379537E-4,2.9953939560615957E-4,2.9949567430525653E-4,2.995888216179574E-4,2.994511142336534E-4,2.994973889388551E-4,2.9980688703667345E-4,3.021857674234326E-4,2.994978836310938E-4,2.9978152705322186E-4,2.9981275911628626E-4,2.996765620081259E-4,2.995122301686317E-4,2.996152739593816E-4,2.997562739259176E-4,2.9952769269367126E-4,2.995265975907086E-4,2.997960672979393E-4,2.995566070978501E-4,2.9955706045081454E-4,2.997489599110464E-4,2.9952780074085216E-4,2.9981634261876745E-4,2.9960275641329885E-4,2.994966544075059E-4,2.9963243339164666E-4,2.997238855294228E-4,2.9955807647149006E-4,2.99718513253905E-4,2.998656675614939E-4,3.001439893977633E-4,2.996022386913128E-4,2.995120485097161E-4,2.9962003951784164E-4,2.995424667552165E-4,2.9945143384220956E-4,2.995275999348191E-4,2.998277777761904E-4,2.9966330336679163E-4,2.997191962607564E-4,2.994663375066467E-4,2.995276760970999E-4,2.995119358817502E-4,2.996133179564693E-4,2.9966527128028855E-4,2.9960433604071785E-4,2.9955684822412964E-4,2.995126765517529E-4,3.001263293859027E-4,2.995880425688496E-4,2.9952760744573684E-4,2.995864381639205E-4,2.994969608332975E-4,0.9763286762691502,2.995436873606932E-4,2.995130970292157E-4,2.994967898727945E-4,2.997363944890621E-4,2.9961607278659245E-4,2.9949666467527246E-4,2.9946621549728904E-4,2.994361008613639E-4,2.997068384968046E-4,2.995113368004337E-4,2.9964748351410646E-4,2.9973542245412846E-4,2.995994383256625E-4,2.9952800416013054E-4,2.9946660807754217E-4,2.9954321716891744E-4,2.994664467811181E-4,2.994821622959343E-4,2.9946661655319356E-4,2.9966101223488113E-4,2.995718235278458E-4,2.994970644262302E-4,2.9952607633160786E-4]}}
{"value":"No redeeming features, this film is rubbish. Its jokes don't begin to be funny. The humour for children is pathetic, and the attempts to appeal to adults just add a tacky smuttishness to the whole miserable package. Sitting through it with my children just made me uncomfortable about what might be coming next. I couldn't enjoy the film at all. Although my child for whom the DVD was bought enjoyed the fact that she owned a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in seeing it again, unlike with Monsters inc, Finding Nemo,

A stage riser, a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set. The movie was ineptly dubbed into English, with the English voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines. The whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it. And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway? MST3K gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deserved.<br /><br />To be or not to be?

{"value":"The plot of Corpse Grinders 2 is very much similar to the original Corpse Grinders, what is left that is different from the other film consists of weird aliens.<br /><br />It is my belief that this film would be the #1 worst film on IMDb - if anyone had actually watched it. The plot is disconnected and, in several (way too many) instances, makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The real wonder here is why in the world was this sequel created to such an unsuccessful and horrendous (but still somewhat better) film.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film if you enjoy watching terrible movies for a good laugh.","finished_norm":["the","plot","of","corps","grinder","be","veri","much","similar","to","the","origin","corps","grinder","what","be","leav","that","be","differ","from","the","other","film","consist","of","weird","aliensbr","br","it","be","my","belief","that","thi","film","would","be","the","wrong","film","on","imdb","if","anyon","have","actual","watch","it","the","plot","be","disconnect","and","in","sever","wai","too","mani","instanc","make","absolut","no","sens","whatsoev","the","real","wonder","here","be","why","in","the","world","be","thi","sequel","creat","to","such","a","unsuccess","and","horrend","but","still","somewhat","well","filmbr","br","i","would","highli","recommend","thi","film","if","you","enjoi","watch","terribl","movi","for","a","good","laugh"],"filtered":["plot","corps","grinder","veri","much","similar","origin","corps","grinder","leav","differ","film","consist","weird","aliensbr","br","belief","thi","film","wrong","film","imdb","anyon","actual","watch","plot","disconnect","sever","wai","mani","instanc","make","absolut","sens","whatsoev","real","wonder","world","thi","sequel","creat","unsuccess","horrend","still","somewhat","well","filmbr","br","highli","recommend","thi","film","enjoi","watch","terribl","movi","good","laugh"],"filtered2":["plot","corps","grinder","veri","similar","origin","corps","grinder","leav","differ","consist","weird","aliensbr","belief","wrong","imdb","anyon","actual","watch","plot","disconnect","sever","wai","mani","instanc","make","absolut","sens","whatsoev","real","wonder","world","sequel","creat","unsuccess","horrend","still","somewhat","well","filmbr","highli","recommend","enjoi","watch","terribl","good","laugh"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,15,20,25,32,33,50,52,64,69,74,80,133,158,165,166,173,175,200,204,222,298,316,362,387,566,589,591,596,625,828,896,991,1216,1513,1571,1681,5236,7641],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,15,20,25,32,33,50,52,64,69,74,80,133,158,165,166,173,175,200,204,222,298,316,362,387,566,589,591,596,625,828,896,991,1216,1513,1571,1681,5236,7641],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,1.9218995441445863,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,2.742262257014735,1.4018535447685214,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,1.883428577602134,2.127032521151058,1.9486336368009016,1.9951803900462557,2.3212364753796515,2.3106972614914807,2.448847599972298,2.4423870329693536,2.4368824319140248,2.3791142619576227,2.5308211829319704,2.624524614047584,2.5771019354959765,2.7819920465008363,2.878207028279898,3.058539100262467,3.360519385990158,3.439602492783994,3.530930586689197,3.509308122676031,3.485528930909917,3.6194333882654965,3.827761853794566,3.8844878351953436,4.004218291136122,4.280272325592784,4.535724120139652,9.430130097590938,4.662879295624898,6.1754673820690815,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.7310929654841826E-4,2.728672805936191E-4,2.729346536330478E-4,2.7287978503727256E-4,2.7290560987210105E-4,2.7286577608575313E-4,2.7295064113039654E-4,2.728251781086751E-4,2.7286733826132936E-4,2.731493170874148E-4,2.7531667741662584E-4,2.7286778896761063E-4,2.7312621200724265E-4,2.7315466704635663E-4,2.7303058001336346E-4,2.728808598712506E-4,2.729747414406556E-4,2.731032042820177E-4,2.7289494753346795E-4,2.72893949802464E-4,2.731394593944328E-4,2.7292129099019605E-4,2.729217040329178E-4,2.730965405986481E-4,2.7289504597354707E-4,2.7315793191883903E-4,2.729633369022279E-4,2.728666690414245E-4,2.7299037512823075E-4,2.730736957257882E-4,2.7292262971329967E-4,2.7306880113045923E-4,2.7320287109470077E-4,2.734564457215512E-4,2.7296286521390765E-4,2.7288069436468324E-4,2.7297908326566093E-4,2.7290840794747505E-4,2.7282546929898E-4,2.7289486302234356E-4,2.7316835031006325E-4,2.730185002747632E-4,2.730694234072083E-4,2.7283904779213384E-4,2.7289493241259405E-4,2.7288059175112334E-4,2.729729593573119E-4,2.730202932096524E-4,2.729647760758073E-4,2.7292151067653895E-4,2.728812665638584E-4,2.7344035596381686E-4,2.729499313510653E-4,2.72894869865422E-4,2.7294846960308804E-4,2.728669482211209E-4,0.9784334310143911,2.7290952002183625E-4,2.728816496542302E-4,2.7286679246170826E-4,2.7308509244124303E-4,2.72975469239504E-4,2.7286667839622437E-4,2.7283893663133615E-4,2.728114996624306E-4,2.730581644437551E-4,2.728800459376028E-4,2.7300408705697467E-4,2.730842068355755E-4,2.7296031384501637E-4,2.72895231305637E-4,2.7283929430500103E-4,2.7290909163753957E-4,2.728391473503779E-4,2.728534655075829E-4,2.728393020270331E-4,2.7301641286068515E-4,2.7293515443910785E-4,2.7286704260300493E-4,2.728934748915345E-4]}}
{"value":"This is a simple tale but it feels very manipulative. It lacks pathos for it does not leave a room for imagination or a personal thought or time for reflection.<br /><br />The animation is well done but I feel like it is too presentational. I would have preferred more images from behind, more space in the background and maybe then this would not feel so kitsch to me.<br /><br />But for a Hollywood style film it works OK but it is very derivative of Aardman films and this is bothering to me. Perhaps a longer film will test if this maker can do without the voice-over.<br /><br />I think the voice over is too glib.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","simpl","tale","but","it","feel","veri","manipul","it","lack","patho","for","it","doe","not","leav","a","room","for","imagin","or","a","person","think","or","time","for","reflectionbr","br","the","anim","be","good","do","but","i","feel","like","it","be","too","present","i","would","have","prefer","much","imag","from","behind","much","space","in","the","background","and","mayb","then","thi","would","not","feel","so","kitsch","to","mebr","br","but","for","a","hollywood","styl","film","it","work","okai","but","it","be","veri","deriv","of","aardman","film","and","thi","be","bother","to","me","perhap","a","long","film","will","test","if","thi","maker","can","do","without","the","voiceoverbr","br","i","think","the","voic","over","be","too","glib"],"filtered":["thi","simpl","tale","feel","veri","manipul","lack","patho","doe","leav","room","imagin","person","think","time","reflectionbr","br","anim","good","feel","like","present","prefer","much","imag","behind","much","space","background","mayb","thi","feel","kitsch","mebr","br","hollywood","styl","film","work","okai","veri","deriv","aardman","film","thi","bother","perhap","long","film","test","thi","maker","without","voiceoverbr","br","think","voic","glib"],"filtered2":["simpl","tale","feel","veri","manipul","lack","patho","doe","leav","room","imagin","person","think","time","reflectionbr","anim","good","feel","like","present","prefer","imag","behind","space","background","mayb","feel","kitsch","mebr","hollywood","styl","work","okai","veri","deriv","aardman","bother","perhap","long","test","maker","without","voiceoverbr","think","voic","glib"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,12,15,18,43,48,74,99,125,153,163,183,191,277,300,318,340,380,393,411,428,496,513,637,736,742,763,801,820,1268,1306,1696,1797,2379],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,8,12,15,18,43,48,74,99,125,153,163,183,191,277,300,318,340,380,393,411,428,496,513,637,736,742,763,801,820,1268,1306,1696,1797,2379],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,2.133457220525776,2.4001215597131385,1.2153159934048174,4.982433610865464,1.6955116224012472,1.9486336368009016,2.056430207256609,2.2242236634876535,2.3409902041158843,2.4000574358028657,2.4885128563647294,2.5460113484259455,3.1163992333432793,2.932274249550174,2.902686292364678,2.948928684455311,3.102062070196872,3.120015873813468,3.229006157521873,3.3721070011625462,3.293679367864308,3.454678155189441,3.7432044657665027,3.6841709341823097,3.7740817043309423,3.749984152751882,3.7881170224473255,3.900174431363043,4.30366520516749,4.499089986959872,4.637773374493822,4.8085911068062925,5.129498826886393]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.997629607572964E-4,2.9949732564315726E-4,2.9957127384642096E-4,2.995110504379539E-4,2.995393956061598E-4,2.994956743052567E-4,2.995888216179576E-4,2.9945111423365357E-4,2.994973889388553E-4,2.9980688703667367E-4,3.021857674234439E-4,2.9949788363109394E-4,2.997815270532221E-4,2.9981275911628643E-4,2.996765620081261E-4,2.995122301686319E-4,2.996152739593818E-4,2.997562739259178E-4,2.9952769269367147E-4,2.9952659759070884E-4,2.9979606729793953E-4,2.9955660709785027E-4,2.995570604508147E-4,2.997489599110466E-4,2.995278007408524E-4,2.9981634261876767E-4,2.9960275641329907E-4,2.994966544075061E-4,2.996324333916469E-4,2.9972388552942296E-4,2.995580764714903E-4,2.9971851325390523E-4,2.998656675614941E-4,3.0014398939776354E-4,2.9960223869131297E-4,2.995120485097163E-4,2.9962003951784186E-4,2.995424667552167E-4,2.994514338422098E-4,2.9952759993481933E-4,2.9982777777619063E-4,2.9966330336679185E-4,2.997191962607566E-4,2.994663375066469E-4,2.9952767609710013E-4,2.9951193588175043E-4,2.9961331795646954E-4,2.9966527128028877E-4,2.9960433604071807E-4,2.9955684822412985E-4,2.9951267655175314E-4,3.001263293859029E-4,2.9958804256884975E-4,2.9952760744573706E-4,2.995864381639207E-4,2.994969608332977E-4,0.97632867626915,2.995436873606934E-4,2.9951309702921594E-4,2.9949678987279473E-4,2.9973639448906234E-4,2.996160727865926E-4,2.994966646752727E-4,2.9946621549728925E-4,2.994361008613641E-4,2.997068384968048E-4,2.995113368004339E-4,2.996474835141067E-4,2.997354224541286E-4,2.995994383256627E-4,2.995280041601307E-4,2.994666080775424E-4,2.9954321716891766E-4,2.994664467811183E-4,2.994821622959345E-4,2.994666165531938E-4,2.9966101223488135E-4,2.99571823527846E-4,2.9949706442623043E-4,2.9952607633160807E-4]}}
{"value":"TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20's during the filming of DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille's sets are unearthed in the desert.<br /><br />One of the worst films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />The question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film? If this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness. If its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons.You will laugh long and hard AT this film, probably more than many other Hollywood \"comedies\".","finished_norm":["tv","movi","about","a","ancient","egyptian","curs","bring","to","the","u","in","the","dure","the","film","of","demil","version","of","the","command","and","which","be","reawaken","when","demil","set","be","unearth","in","the","desertbr","br","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","see","in","a","long","timebr","br","the","question","be","be","the","filmmak","seriou","or","kid","when","thei","make","thi","film","if","thi","be","seriou","it","a","laughabl","bad","movi","and","a","great","film","to","pick","on","for","it","bad","if","it","a","comedi","it","littl","good","but","funni","for","all","of","the","wrong","reasonsy","will","laugh","long","and","hard","at","thi","film","probabl","much","than","mani","other","hollywood","comedi"],"filtered":["tv","movi","ancient","egyptian","curs","bring","u","dure","film","demil","version","command","reawaken","demil","set","unearth","desertbr","br","wrong","film","see","long","timebr","br","question","filmmak","seriou","kid","thei","make","thi","film","thi","seriou","laughabl","bad","movi","great","film","pick","bad","comedi","littl","good","funni","wrong","reasonsy","laugh","long","hard","thi","film","probabl","much","mani","hollywood","comedi"],"filtered2":["tv","ancient","egyptian","curs","bring","u","dure","demil","version","command","reawaken","demil","set","unearth","desertbr","wrong","see","long","timebr","question","filmmak","seriou","kid","make","seriou","laughabl","bad","great","pick","bad","comedi","littl","good","funni","wrong","reasonsy","laugh","long","hard","probabl","mani","hollywood","comedi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,9,14,25,50,51,62,99,109,112,114,127,133,148,171,172,220,239,250,300,323,378,446,493,552,1250,1566,1723,1772,4603],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,9,14,25,50,51,62,99,109,112,114,127,133,148,171,172,220,239,250,300,323,378,446,493,552,1250,1566,1723,1772,4603],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,2.1367141713444147,1.1175081997259209,2.559277576165403,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,2.0226120445069267,4.112860414513218,2.125691139326857,2.2466628996789315,2.4433074195966826,4.871935874217273,2.3212364753796515,2.3018654096236517,2.373087554090762,2.5001408943598484,2.8336934208777267,2.6593400337329487,2.6812935439488212,2.932274249550174,3.0433232530252132,3.130944944345658,3.233054746047873,6.68450807602573,3.424750734647968,4.280272325592784,4.74221603786142,4.85885294158718,4.8184434032493035,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.2343694346142896E-4,3.2315032963437E-4,3.232301179470343E-4,3.231651383541246E-4,3.231957221011734E-4,3.231485478809411E-4,3.2324905156570424E-4,3.231004686475251E-4,3.2315039792888865E-4,3.234843388484492E-4,3.260510929237655E-4,3.231509316897816E-4,3.2345697604314096E-4,3.2349067467952363E-4,3.233437213125686E-4,3.231664112548313E-4,3.2327759299869525E-4,3.234297285330166E-4,3.231830949432508E-4,3.2318191335379057E-4,3.234726646135258E-4,3.232142928820688E-4,3.2321478203889046E-4,3.234218368888709E-4,3.23183211523531E-4,3.234945411915386E-4,3.2326408687093886E-4,3.23149605387429E-4,3.232961076087369E-4,3.233947822409883E-4,3.232158783004865E-4,3.233889856863756E-4,3.2354776160499975E-4,3.238480640966556E-4,3.232635282615085E-4,3.231662152492799E-4,3.2328273492036E-4,3.231990357963056E-4,3.231008134973833E-4,3.2318299485870554E-4,3.2350687944825824E-4,3.233294155610616E-4,3.233897226341553E-4,3.2311689418880604E-4,3.2318307703595406E-4,3.2316609372644414E-4,3.232754825191292E-4,3.2333153889185887E-4,3.2326579125050234E-4,3.232145530514595E-4,3.231668928913616E-4,3.2382900937340606E-4,3.232482109906659E-4,3.231830029628031E-4,3.232464798767717E-4,3.231499360134048E-4,0.9744592174568528,3.2320035279992593E-4,3.2316734657631665E-4,3.2314975155118045E-4,3.234082791041812E-4,3.232784549138257E-4,3.231496164660993E-4,3.2311676254367683E-4,3.2308426958399804E-4,3.2337638890743176E-4,3.231654473322752E-4,3.233123463248039E-4,3.234072303021307E-4,3.232605067350857E-4,3.231834310079845E-4,3.231171861282211E-4,3.231998454744365E-4,3.231170120933028E-4,3.2313396875153784E-4,3.231171952732428E-4,3.2332694348545787E-4,3.2323071103992185E-4,3.2315004778765954E-4,3.231813509278995E-4]}}

{"value":"I am, as many are, a fan of Tony Scott films. When this movie came out I had high hopes that it would be like 'Man On Fire'. To find out that the movie it's the furthest thing from it! The story was treading water from the get go, and the choice of Mickey Rourke was not such such a good idea. And the whole 'arm'scene was too gratuitous! <br /><br />The movie is centered around Kiera Kinghtly, and this movie reveals that she'll never become a movie star! The movie brought some of the worst acting ever.<br /><br />I like Tony Scott's direction 'n all, but this takes the whole friggin cake!

{"value":"This was quite possibly the worst film I've ever seen. The plot didn't make a whole lot of sense and the acting was awful. I'm a big fan of Amber Benson, I think she's usually a wonderful actress, I can't imagine why she decided to do this film. Her character, Piper, is drunk for almost the whole film, with the exception of the opening scene. On the plus side, there was several points in the film where the acting was so bad, I actually laughed out loud. But despite that, I would not recommend this film to anyone. It's only 80 minutes long, but that's 80 minutes of your life that you will have completely wasted.","finished_norm":["thi","be","quit","possibli","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","the","plot","do","not","make","a","whole","lot","of","sens","and","the","act","be","aw","i","be","a","big","fan","of","amber","benson","i","think","she","usual","a","wonder","actress","i","ca","not","imagin","why","she","decid","to","do","thi","film","her","charact","piper","be","drink","for","almost","the","whole","film","with","the","except","of","the","open","scene","on","the","plu","side","there","be","sever","point","in","the","film","where","the","act","be","so","bad","i","actual","laugh","out","loud","but","despit","that","i","would","not","recommend","thi","film","to","anyon","it","onli","minut","long","but","that","minut","of","your","life","that","you","will","have","complet","wast"],"filtered":["thi","quit","possibli","wrong","film","ever","see","plot","make","whole","lot","sens","act","aw","big","fan","amber","benson","think","usual","wonder","actress","ca","imagin","decid","thi","film","charact","piper","drink","almost","whole","film","except","open","scene","plu","side","sever","point","film","act","bad","actual","laugh","loud","despit","recommend","thi","film","anyon","onli","minut","long","minut","life","complet","wast"],"filtered2":["quit","possibli","wrong","ever","see","plot","make","whole","lot","sens","act","aw","big","fan","amber","benson","think","usual","wonder","actress","ca","imagin","decid","charact","piper","drink","almost","whole","except","open","scene","plu","side","sever","point","act","bad","actual","laugh","loud","despit","recommend","anyon","onli","minut","long","minut","life","complet","wast"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,9,10,11,12,19,21,25,32,44,52,59,66,72,75,81,82,89,99,103,111,120,131,133,138,140,158,173,175,232,242,249,265,298,316,340,355,391,425,558,667,749,957,4687,6311,7077],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,9,10,11,12,19,21,25,32,44,52,59,66,72,75,81,82,89,99,103,111,120,131,133,138,140,158,173,175,232,242,249,265,298,316,340,355,391,425,558,667,749,957,4687,6311,7077],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.312380678011735,2.324031090670098,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.604729392502474,1.7122153074726136,3.7386508898401445,1.929723173391612,1.9209463754160525,1.9742250248702675,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,1.9940046109572438,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,4.236691060675177,2.2044500422972613,2.2512118082053005,2.3212364753796515,2.2907365189289424,2.317169775997098,2.3106972614914807,2.4368824319140248,2.3791142619576227,2.6102777977348763,2.689504733779216,2.6754694156628323,2.73529586597515,2.7819920465008363,2.878207028279898,2.948928684455311,3.0316467233633775,3.109204957709252,3.226987993365636,3.4572130107926293,3.6652429242967908,3.7165362186843414,3.969732115064953,6.214688095222362,6.725513718988353,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006077E-4,2.407566716068781E-4,2.408161162888994E-4,2.4076770454651E-4,2.4079049035382474E-4,2.4075534414722292E-4,2.408302224017343E-4,2.4071952367870055E-4,2.4075672248833946E-4,2.4100551847254195E-4,2.4291782711448497E-4,2.4075712015618703E-4,2.40985132363268E-4,2.4101023885640495E-4,2.409007541978266E-4,2.4076865289565072E-4,2.4085148662392333E-4,2.409648321523583E-4,2.407810827430798E-4,2.407802024235518E-4,2.4099682081796456E-4,2.408043261416532E-4,2.4080469057813204E-4,2.4095895264117175E-4,2.4078116959887926E-4,2.4101311952363035E-4,2.4084142415433337E-4,2.407561320212211E-4,2.4086528056278383E-4,2.4093879611840701E-4,2.4080550732584626E-4,2.4093447751165537E-4,2.4105277032522771E-4,2.4127650467341212E-4,2.4084100797358142E-4,2.4076850686564595E-4,2.4085531750952718E-4,2.407929591559196E-4,2.407197806021707E-4,2.4078100817709675E-4,2.410223118943286E-4,2.4089009598459945E-4,2.4093502655981756E-4,2.4073176119878176E-4,2.407810694016075E-4,2.4076841632749462E-4,2.4084991425345293E-4,2.408916779296219E-4,2.408426939681421E-4,2.4080451997563946E-4,2.4076901172928738E-4,2.412623083340392E-4,2.4082959614816154E-4,2.407810142148921E-4,2.4082830641647594E-4,2.4075637834747296E-4,0.9809713522425287,2.407939403630515E-4,2.4076934973816348E-4,2.4075624091759247E-4,2.4094885168561973E-4,2.4085212877650368E-4,2.4075614027516224E-4,2.4073166311921866E-4,2.4070745489132743E-4,2.4092509253415925E-4,2.407679347444839E-4,2.408773788924865E-4,2.4094807029668806E-4,2.4083875684592344E-4,2.407813331213691E-4,2.407319787023875E-4,2.4079356239037109E-4,2.4073184904116222E-4,2.4074448225927734E-4,2.407319855157025E-4,2.408882542142538E-4,2.4081655816085952E-4,2.4075646162263957E-4,2.4077978339942234E-4]}}
