{"value":"I must agree with the very first comment: this movie sucks very, very hard. Despite having a very big B-list cast, the cover of this film (for those who aren't watching it on Comedy Central during a weekday which is probably the only exposure this film will ever get) tries to put the blame on Dangerfield but in reality is just a paycheck for every has-been comedian from the '80s. Randy Quaid? Check. Ed Begley, Jr? Check. The voice of Lisa Simpson? She can now say that Maximum Overdrive wasn't her only horrible flick: double check. And so many, many others.<br /><br />The saddest thing about this flick is that it was so lazily written with already-told jokes. Nothing about this movie outside of its existence is funny. You're better off watching paint dry. This is definitely direct-to-video scraping-the-bottom-of-the-barrel stuff that still believes in the old video adage: throw an old-time star on the cover and you'll get some money back off of the rental. Considering the days of video rental are changing, consider this one of the last examples of putting out garbage.<br /><br />The only use this movie has if you're having trouble falling asleep. It'll get you there.","finished_norm":["i","must","agre","with","the","veri","comment","thi","movi","suck","veri","veri","hard","despit","have","a","veri","big","blist","cast","the","cover","of","thi","film","for","that","who","be","not","watch","it","on","comedi","central","dure","a","weekdai","which","be","probabl","the","onli","exposur","thi","film","will","ever","get","try","to","put","the","blame","on","dangerfield","but","in","realiti","be","just","a","paycheck","for","everi","hasbeen","comedian","from","the","randi","quaid","check","ed","beglei","jr","check","the","voic","of","lisa","simpson","she","can","now","sai","that","maximum","overdr","be","not","her","onli","horribl","flick","doubl","check","and","so","mani","mani","othersbr","br","the","sad","thing","about","thi","flick","be","that","it","be","so","lazili","write","with","alreadytold","joke","noth","about","thi","movi","outsid","of","it","exist","be","funni","you","re","well","off","watch","paint","spindri","thi","be","definit","directtovideo","scrapingthebottomofthebarrel","stuff","that","still","believ","in","the","old","video","adag","throw","a","oldtim","star","on","the","cover","and","you","will","get","some","monei","back","off","of","the","rental","consid","the","dai","of","video","rental","be","chang","consid","thi","on","of","the","last","exampl","of","putt","out","garbagebr","br","the","onli","us","thi","movi","have","if","you","re","have","troubl","fall","asleep","it","will","get","you","there"],"filtered":["must","agre","veri","comment","thi","movi","suck","veri","veri","hard","despit","veri","big","blist","cast","cover","thi","film","watch","comedi","central","dure","weekdai","probabl","onli","exposur","thi","film","ever","get","try","put","blame","dangerfield","realiti","paycheck","everi","hasbeen","comedian","randi","quaid","check","ed","beglei","jr","check","voic","lisa","simpson","sai","maximum","overdr","onli","horribl","flick","doubl","check","mani","mani","othersbr","br","sad","thing","thi","flick","lazili","write","alreadytold","joke","noth","thi","movi","outsid","exist","funni","re","well","watch","paint","spindri","thi","definit","directtovideo","scrapingthebottomofthebarrel","stuff","still","believ","old","video","adag","throw","oldtim","star","cover","get","monei","back","rental","consid","dai","video","rental","chang","consid","thi","last","exampl","putt","garbagebr","br","onli","us","thi","movi","re","troubl","fall","asleep","get"],"filtered2":["must","agre","veri","comment","suck","veri","veri","hard","despit","veri","big","blist","cast","cover","watch","comedi","central","dure","weekdai","probabl","onli","exposur","ever","get","try","put","blame","dangerfield","realiti","paycheck","everi","hasbeen","comedian","randi","quaid","check","ed","beglei","jr","check","voic","lisa","simpson","maximum","overdr","onli","horribl","flick","doubl","check","mani","mani","othersbr","sad","thing","flick","lazili","write","alreadytold","joke","noth","outsid","exist","funni","re","well","watch","paint","spindri","definit","directtovideo","scrapingthebottomofthebarrel","stuff","still","believ","old","video","adag","throw","oldtim","star","cover","get","monei","back","rental","consid","dai","video","rental","chang","consid","last","exampl","putt","garbagebr","onli","us","re","troubl","fall","asleep","get"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,11,15,20,29,36,44,49,50,56,62,63,64,65,67,68,82,85,91,92,100,126,127,132,141,144,148,159,169,171,214,230,239,240,257,278,280,307,310,317,361,391,392,421,428,455,491,505,528,622,656,752,791,868,898,1213,1263,1307,1346,1376,1447,1505,1633,1844,2007,2119,3638,3997,4532,4839,5118,5327,5526,5866,7067,7911,8554],"values":[3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,11,15,20,29,36,44,49,50,56,62,63,64,65,67,68,82,85,91,92,100,126,127,132,141,144,148,159,169,171,214,230,239,240,257,278,280,307,310,317,361,391,392,421,428,455,491,505,528,622,656,752,791,868,898,1213,1263,1307,1346,1376,1447,1505,1633,1844,2007,2119,3638,3997,4532,4839,5118,5327,5526,5866,7067,7911,8554],"values":[2.389902141215977,1.9218995441445863,2.9739294460164585,4.800243119426277,1.165345040023057,1.3195384777338066,1.4680183469605717,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,3.43598877114071,1.8610609350701788,2.0226120445069267,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,1.9073850067444174,1.9570915389266579,4.012839573363895,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.0105926690411424,2.0489535369135887,2.1405462403177813,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.253494045787767,2.2657547357741192,2.2931108769894046,2.3018654096236517,2.300267965194495,2.4071371113909277,2.373087554090762,2.7303758068497004,2.7121382192999195,2.65934003

{"value":"I cringed all the way through this movie. First of all, the idiotic plot has little to do with Parson's own story. Hollywood has attempted to create a kind of comedy car chase movie. Imagine \"Englebert Sings Hendrix\".<br /><br />Do not take anything about this movie to be accurate. The name Parsons in the title and stealing of his body is just used as springboard for a low budget chase movie, a blatant attempt to grab a few bucks from the Parsons legacy and his fan base. Gram's father had long since been dead in 1973, the other global characters are fictional, none of this has anything to do with Grams life or death.<br /><br />If you are a Gram fan, I advise you to not see this movie. I wish I hadn't. It's saddening to see something special be treated as such disgracing fodder. I'd swear I could hear Gram turning in his grave while the movie was playing. If you are not familiar with Gram's life and legacy, do not take anything in this movie as being representative of Gram.<br /><br />I cannot say enough bad things about this movie.

{"value":"- A small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money. Of course the mob boss wants his money back and doesn't care who he has to kill to get it. The punk enlists his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life.<br /><br />- If this sounds ridiculous, it is. The whole idea that this Izod-wearing, dune buggy-driving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in Rome is just plain silly. His friend may be good with a gun, but he's up against a group of trained killers. The old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob. There's also a sub-plot about how the friend's father was killed years ago by the mob boss, but there's little made of it and it doesn't help the movie any at all.<br /><br />- The mob boss, Mister Scarface, is played by Jack Palance. I suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek. Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast, doing what he must to get a paycheck.<br /><br />- I've seen some pretty good Italian crime/cop flicks recently, but Mister Scarface isn't one of them.

{"value":"DOC SAVAGE: THE MAN OF BRONZE (1 outta 5 stars)<br /><br />Dreadful, dreadful movie... based on the pulp magazine/paperback series by Lester Dent/Kenneth Robeson... about a super-heroic adventure hero in the '30s and his five assistants, all experts in some field of endeavor that allows them to combat evil. It was a pretty hokey series... but kinda fun to read when I was a teenager. I knew they made a movie version in the '70s, starring Ron (Tarzan) Ely... but I never got a chance to see it. It never played in theaters where I lived and was never shown on TV. Now that I have finally seen the film I can understand why. The plot and characters are never treated seriously... it's all kind of tongue-in-cheek and campy... kind of like the old Batman TV series... only without the benefit of being funny... or having any visual flair. Corny dialogue, cheesy special effects, dumb stereotypes, crummy action scenes and bad, bad acting. Actually, I find it kind of fascinating in its badness... what could they have possibly been thinking? Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumoured to be starring in a modern-day remake... but I don't imagine that would have turned out to be much better.","finished_norm":["doc","savag","the","man","of","bronz","outta","starsbr","br","dread","dread","movi","base","on","the","pulp","magazinepaperback","seri","by","lester","dentkenneth","robeson","about","a","superhero","adventur","hero","in","the","and","hi","five","assist","all","expert","in","some","field","of","endeavor","that","allow","them","to","combat","evil","it","be","a","pretti","hokei","seri","but","kinda","fun","to","read","when","i","be","a","teenag","i","know","thei","make","a","movi","version","in","the","star","ron","tarzan","eli","but","i","never","get","a","chanc","to","see","it","it","never","plai","in","theater","where","i","live","and","be","never","show","on","tv","now","that","i","have","final","see","the","film","i","can","understand","why","the","plot","and","charact","be","never","treat","serious","it","all","kind","of","tongueincheek","and","campi","kind","of","like","the","old","batman","tv","seri","onli","without","the","benefit","of","be","funni","or","have","ani","visual","flair","corni","dialogu","cheesi","special","effect","dumb","stereotyp","crummi","action","scene","and","bad","bad","act","actual","i","find","it","kind","of","fascin","in","it","bad","what","can","thei","have","possibli","be","think","arnold","schwarzenegg","be","rumour","to","be","star","in","a","moderndai","remak","but","i","do","not","imagin","that","would","have","turn","out","to","be","much","well"],"filtered":["doc","savag","man","bronz","outta","starsbr","br","dread","dread","movi","base","pulp","magazinepaperback","seri","lester","dentkenneth","robeson","superhero","adventur","hero","hi","five","assist","expert","field","endeavor","allow","combat","evil","pretti","hokei","seri","kinda","fun","read","teenag","know","thei","make","movi","version","star","ron","tarzan","eli","never","get","chanc","see","never","plai","theater","live","never","show","tv","final","see","film","understand","plot","charact","never","treat","serious","kind","tongueincheek","campi","kind","like","old","batman","tv","seri","onli","without","benefit","funni","ani","visual","flair","corni","dialogu","cheesi","special","effect","dumb","stereotyp","crummi","action","scene","bad","bad","act","actual","find","kind","fascin","bad","thei","possibli","think","arnold","schwarzenegg","rumour","star","moderndai","remak","imagin","turn","much","well"],"filtered2":["doc","savag","man","bronz","outta","starsbr","dread","dread","base","pulp","magazinepaperback","lester","dentkenneth","robeson","superhero","adventur","hero","five","assist","expert","field","endeavor","allow","combat","evil","pretti","hokei","kinda","fun","read","teenag","know","make","version","star","ron","tarzan","eli","never","get","chanc","see","never","plai","theater","live","never","show","tv","final","see","understand","plot","charact","never","treat","serious","kind","tongueincheek","campi","kind","like","old","batman","tv","onli","without","benefit","funni","ani","visual","flair","corni","dialogu","cheesi","special","effect","dumb","stereotyp","crummi","action","scene","bad","bad","act","actual","find","kind","fascin","bad","possibli","think","arnold","schwarzenegg","rumour","star","moderndai","remak","imagin","turn","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,9,10,11,12,19,20,21,26,27,28,32,38,40,42,45,52,62,67,78,96,100,106,116,122,125,129,145,156,172,203,212,220,248,259,321,334,340,371,375,420,424,483,486,504,521,543,558,604,635,693,849,995,1076,1086,1257,1282,1397,1485,1621,1734,1857,1888,1940,2308,2442,2761,2765,2863,2979,3099,3270,3740,3795,4771,5038,5610,5648,5822,6135,6596,7150],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,9,10,11,12,19,20,21,26,27,28,32,38,40,42,45,52,62,67,78,96,100,106,116,122,125,129,145,156,172,203,212,220,248,259,321,334,340,371,375,420,424,483,486,504,521,543,558,604,635,693,849,995,1076,1086,1257,1282,1397,1485,1621,1734,1857,1888,1940,2308,2442,2761,2765,2863,2979,3099,3270,3740,3795,4771,5038,5610,5648,5822,6135,6596,7150],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,3.205071257016622,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,6.487981722981535,1.8162961064622165,1.7122153074726136,2.0226120445069267,1.9570915389266579,2.0064197866819473,2.0390708128715254,4.281092480635563,2.159084361316692,2.2466628996789315,6.746804302119746,2.2242236634876535,2.4106958340079214,2.34599021453259,2.3451551414151686,5.000281788719697,2.569760528637609,2.5

{"value":"The movie has the longest, most tortured and agonized ending of any movie I've seen in a long time. Unfortunately it starts right after the opening credits. January Jones gives such a wooden performance, I was surprised she didn't go up in flames when she got near the candles in the film. I don't really remember her from the other films she's done (a blessing I have to believe. I never criticize an actors performance because in film there are too many things which can affect it but in this case,it is so bad that it actually stands out from the ATROCIOUS script. Granted she's given lines and situations Meryl Streep would have trouble with but I swear at times shes reading from a cue card off set. At other times I thought she might actually be learning disabled or slow in some way. For REAL! The plot, dialog and pacing are as bad as you'll ever see but there is still no excuse for this performance nor for the director that let it be perpetrated. I feel sorry for the other actors.

{"value":"ALL FOR LOVE ( as it titled when it was broadcast at the weekend ) is a romantic period drama featuring Captain Saint Ives a French officer in Napoleon`s army who is captured by the British and imprisoned in Scotland where he meets and falls in love with a young maiden who visits the prison . There`s also a storyline involving a murder .<br /><br />I will be honest and confess that I wasn`t too taken by the movie since I`m not much of a fan of period dramas and the screenplay feels somewhat episodic but I will say that this is well acted by everyone involved and it`s got a good cast that features Miranda Richardson , Anna Friel , Richard E Grant , Michael Gough and Jason Isaacs . The costume design as you can expect is also excellent <br /><br />I`ll be very surprised if this movie doesn`t get any complaints after being broadcast on BBC2 at teatime . Captain Saint Ives lies in bed with a prostitute where a nipple is fully exposed and there`s a scene of French prisoners bathing that includes full frontal male nudity not to mention a murder scene where blood is clearly seen .

{"value":"I haven't seen this, & don't plan to see this movie or any other that includes Lindsay......unless & until \"poor little rich girl\" straightens out her life for a 2 year period beginning with her most recent arrest in July 2007.<br /><br />In fact, I don't know anyone that has gone to see ANY of Lindsay's recent movies. I rather imagine 2007 will be the high water mark in her movie making career, until she cleans up her act. All of the recent publicity has only hindered her movie making career, if she has any further aspirations to make any more movies <br /><br />Up to this time, movie producers have actively sought Lindsay for roles in their upcoming production. Now, Lindsay will probably have to go to auditions & actually compete for ANY role. Her reputation is currently \"poison\" & quite possible could have a negative effect on box office ticket sales on any movie she is in.<br /><br />Sooooo....now Lindsay is going to have to deal with \"not being wanted\".....is she going to be able to handle this?<br /><br />I wonder if even Jay Leno will want to have Lindsay back on his TV Show?<br /><br />All of the foregoing is merely my OPINION.

{"value":"Since its release in 1983, \"A Christmas Story\", the Jean Shepherd-narrated story of his alter-ego, Ralphie, has become a true classic. \"My Summer Story\", however, still has Shepherd as the narrator, but it has absolutely none of the charm, and the characters are nowhere near the caliber of the original film.<br /><br />\"My Summer Story\" is basically a mishmash of mediocre and just plain not very interesting stories, which include hillbilly neighbors and battling tops. Charles Grodin, who I normally like, is extremely unlikeable in the role of the father (more aptly handled by Darren McGavin in the original), and his character never seems anything but forced. Kiernan Culkin is a poor substitute for Ralphie, and the little brother is all but forgotten here. Only mom seems to have any worth here and perhaps that's because she beans a cinema manager with a gravy boat when he pushes his luck too far with irate housewives on \"free dish night\".<br /><br />The stories in this are mostly inconsequential and stretched paper-thin. May appeal to the extremely undemanding but as a sequel to \"A Christmas Story\", it's a very poor one and not worth most people's time. 2 out of

{"value":"Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard-earned dollars. Suggestion? Keep your hard-earned dollars and let's just say that good old TheatreX took one for the team on this one. Guess what the plots about? Zombies taking over. This time though, for the sake of originality (?) this film takes place in Rhode Island, and to be honest I'm not sure I've ever seen a zombie flick based in Rhode Island. A TV station, controlled by the government, is supposedly keeping up \"normal\" broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won't think that there's any problem in the world, that is, those that never look or go outside, anyway. I will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film. There is actually somewhat of a story to this but I'm not bothering with that because after a while you'll either not care or have fallen asleep. At any rate, this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the \"seen it all before\" stuff that gets trotted out before the camera.

{"value":"Having seen the hot Eliza Dushku in the pretty good Wrong Turn, I decided to pick this one up instead of Return of the Living Dead, of all movies. Haven't seen that one yet, but, considering it is one of the most highly acclaimed horror movies ever, safe to say I made the wrong choice. There is simply nothing to recommend this movie, and I am talking about the supposedly superior killer cut. It didn't even have the youthful sex appeal of mediocre to poor movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer or Valentine or Urban Legend. It simply made no sense, held no excitement, had very little interesting acting or compelling writing. The release date was apparently put off numerous times for about a year running, and the reason is obvious. The whole movie comes off as a bunch of meaningless scenes thrown together haphazardly, to meaningless effect. Get Wrong Turn instead, if you want to see Dushku. I would like to see a movie with her and the super-hot Elisabeth Harnois--but I don't think even that would have made this movie watchable. Casey Affleck, so promising in Good Will Hunting, is awful here--he seems to lack both intelligence and guts.

{"value":"Daddy's girls Florence Lawrence and Dorothy West receive some terrific news at the local post office, unaware they are being stalked by burglar Charles Inslee. Meanwhile, father David Miles receives a message (from young Robert Harron) which necessitates daddy leaving home; so, when the young women return, they can be home alone. As the vulnerable pair bed down for the evening, the local \"Grand Ball of the Black and Tans\" gets underway; and, a dark-skinned drinker portends additional danger for D.W. Griffith's dynamic duo <br /><br />Mr. Inslee has one of his better Biograph roles, stealing the film from \"The Girls and Daddy\". Ironically, Director Griffith appears as one of the black-faced extras at the \"Black and Tans\" ball. \"Biograph Girls\" Lawrence and West are suggestive of later \"Griffith Girls\" Lillian and Dorothy Gish, especially in \"Orphans of the Storm\" (1921); and, they are excessively affectionate in bed! The racist tone is unfortunate, since the story of a burglar redeemed by saving his potential victims from a greater danger, is intriguing. <br /><br />*** The Girls and Daddy (2/1/09) D.W.

{"value":"If you haven't figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes. Lilia is a widow. She has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out. She has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger. While checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared...the cabaret, where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her. The film is very misogamist. It's portrayal of men is dismal. Which is rather odd as Lilia stoops to jiggle around for them, not for money, but just for the hell of it. When she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again. She does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention. The other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short-lived. Not short enough I say. She does find romance, however brief , with you guessed it....No surprises here we didn't see coming. Though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way.

{"value":"The summary provided by my cable TV guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is. \"Slaughterhouse Rock\" is by far the worst horror film that I have ever seen, a title previously held by \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\". From its opening scene I could tell it's going to be really bad, but I was so bored that I couldn't care less. This film contains laughable acting, especially by the guy who's tormented in his dreams, incredible as in not credible plot twists, and some of the crappiest music I've heard, and I'm living in a period when the likes of Britney Spears and Nsync dominate the air waves. The biggest problem with \"Slaughterhouse Rock\" is that it's not funny. One would a film as dull and boring and so NOT scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny one-liners here and there, but no. We have Tormented Guy's self-centered friend trying to be funny, but came across as annoying instead. (spoiler) And please, do tell me, who in this crazy world is insane and self-loathing enough to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night? No one! If you're going to make a horror movie, at least make it believable.

{"value":"Mark Pirro's \"Deathrow Gameshow\" of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts, but occasionally very funny nevertheless. This movie could certainly have been a lot better, the acting is terrible, and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch at times, but the concept is funny, and it has some hilarious moments.<br /><br />In the near future (the year 1991), game shows have changed. Chuck Todean (John Mc Cafferty) hosts a game show called \"Live Or Die\", in which convicted death row inmates have the chance to play for their lives, and for money. Candidates who fail, get executed on the air using many different methods, such as guillotines, electric chairs, and other, more bizarre devices of execution, followed by applause from the cheering studio audience. The show is, of course, more than controversial, and Chuck has made lots of enemies...<br /><br />\"Deathrow Gameshow\" is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects, and the acting is terrible, but it is without doubt fun in many parts, especially if you're a fan of dark humor. You haven't missed anything if you haven't seen it, but it is definitely funny and a good time waster.

{"value":"Ah, the infamous \"Guinea Pig\" series...I honestly have to say that I've been disappointed as a whole by this entire series (\"He Never Dies\",\"Mermaid in a Manhole\", and \"Flower of Flesh and Blood\" being the exceptions...and even those aren't great by any means...), but \"Devil's Experiment\" just plain blows. There is nothing realistic-looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. The victim appears to not really care what is going on and barely whines or whimpers while being subjected to \"hideous\" (more often sometimes \"hilarious\") tortures. \"Flower of Flesh and Blood\" is a more violent and gory depiction of fake \"snuff\" material, but that film also falls flat on the realism level. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in \"extreme\" film-making, but \"Devil's Experiment\" just doesn't hold up. Worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but I can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the needle-through-the-eye

{"value":"I rented this film purely on the fact that the cover appealed to me. However as soon as the film began I had regrets. It seems they used a home video camera to shoot this film and let a young child do it. They also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try and scare people but i found myself laughing, i could have put that together myself and done a better job of it.<br /><br />As for the plot I felt that it had some really good ideas but because of dodgy lines and in some cases acting they were overshadowed. It had no direction.<br /><br />I didn't want to sit through it all because it caused me physical pain to watch it but i always finish what i start so i took a deep breath and let it carry on. Definitely 98minutes of my life wasted.<br /><br />I would save yourself the embarrassment of knowing that you have watched 'Haunted Boat' and find something that is more entertaining. I'm a fan of low budget horror films but this was a major disappointment i thought nothing could get worse after 'Terror Toons' but this made me reconsider.

{"value":"Shazbot, is this embarrassing. In fact, here's a list of 100 that makes up the embarrassment: 1.) a failed comeback for Christopher Lloyd. 2.) Jeff Daniels basically playing the same role he played in the live 101 Dalmatians remake which wasn't too juicy to begin with. He sure has a funny way of promoting his Purple Rose Theatre... 3.) Disnefluff. 4.) another disappointing reminder that Wallace Shawn is to Disney what Jet Li was to Bob Hoskins in Unleashed. 5.) Ray Walston, the original martian from the TV series, played a bit part (read \"cameo\") in this flick and died two years later of lupus. Coincidence? 6.) awful special effects. Seriously - awful. 7.-100.) that damn talking, farting suit voiced to an annoying degree by Wayne Knight (\"Newman!\"). My favorite scene? HA! HA ha, ha! Ha ha ha ha ha... Whew!... Good one. You - You're a joker. Okay, let's wrap up this review with a moment of silence for this franchise's agonizing death, and if you would like, you can say a quick prayer that Disney doesn't forget this travesty and do something silly like a movie adaptation of \"Mork and Mindy\" starring Tim Allen.........................................................","finished_norm":["shazbot","be","thi","embarrass","in","fact","here","a","list","of","that","make","up","the","embarrass","a","fail","comeback","for","christoph","lloyd","jeff","daniel","basic","plai","the","same","role","he","plai","in","the","live","dalmatian","remak","which","be","not","too","juici","to","begin","with","he","sure","have","a","funni","wai","of","promot","hi","purpl","rise","theatr","disnefluff","anoth","disappoint","remind","that","wallac","shawn","be","to","disnei","what","jet","li","be","to","bob","hoskin","in","unleash","rai","walston","the","origin","martian","from","the","tv","seri","plai","a","bite","part","read","cameo","in","thi","flick","and","die","two","year","late","of","lupu","coincid","aw","special","effect","serious","aw","that","damn","talk","fart","suit","voic","to","a","annoi","degre","by","wayn","knight","newman","my","favorit","scene","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","whew","good","on","you","you","re","a","joker","okai","let","wrap","up","thi","review","with","a","moment","of","silenc","for","thi","franchis","agon","death","and","if","you","would","like","you","can","sai","a","quick","prayer","that","disnei","doe","not","forget","thi","travesti","and","do","someth","silli","like","a","movi","adapt","of","mork","and","mindi","star","tim","allen"],"filtered":["shazbot","thi","embarrass","fact","list","make","embarrass","fail","comeback","christoph","lloyd","jeff","daniel","basic","plai","role","plai","live","dalmatian","remak","juici","begin","sure","funni","wai","promot","hi","purpl","rise","theatr","disnefluff","anoth","disappoint","remind","wallac","shawn","disnei","jet","li","bob","hoskin","unleash","rai","walston","origin","martian","tv","seri","plai","bite","part","read","cameo","thi","flick","die","two","year","late","lupu","coincid","aw","special","effect","serious","aw","damn","talk","fart","suit","voic","annoi","degre","wayn","knight","newman","favorit","scene","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","whew","good","re","joker","okai","let","wrap","thi","review","moment","silenc","thi","franchis","agon","death","like","sai","quick","prayer","disnei","doe","forget","thi","travesti","someth","silli","like","movi","adapt","mork","mindi","star","tim","allen"],"filtered2":["shazbot","embarrass","fact","list","make","embarrass","fail","comeback","christoph","lloyd","jeff","daniel","basic","plai","role","plai","live","dalmatian","remak","juici","begin","sure","funni","wai","promot","purpl","rise","theatr","disnefluff","anoth","disappoint","remind","wallac","shawn","disnei","jet","li","bob","hoskin","unleash","rai","walston","origin","martian","tv","plai","bite","part","read","cameo","flick","die","two","year","late","lupu","coincid","aw","special","effect","serious","aw","damn","talk","fart","suit","voic","annoi","degre","wayn","knight","newman","favorit","scene","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","ha","whew","good","re","joker","okai","let","wrap","review","moment","silenc","franchis","agon","death","like","quick","prayer","disnei","doe","forget","travesti","someth","silli","like","adapt","mork","mindi","star","tim","allen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,18,19,33,40,47,53,57,61,62,68,69,73,97,100,106,116,119,124,128,138,145,147,150,154,172,176,186,187,188,191,203,215,245,257,271,286,293,371,372,385,428,483,556,601,644,701,822,841,884,889,922,1118,1162,1173,1199,1345,1444,1463,1476,1624,1687,1869,1873,1903,1989,2002,2008,2503,2703,2810,2826,2854,2868,3040,3097,3603,3628,3682,3731,4312,5184,5621,6334,6610,6643,7128,8373],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,18,19,33,40,47,53,57,61,62,68,69,73,97,100,106,116,119,124,128,138,145,147,150,154,172,176,186,187,188,191,203,215,245,257,271,286,293,371,372,385,428,483,556,601,644,701,822,841,884,889,922,1118,1162,1173,1199,1345,1444,1463,1476,1624,1687,1869,1873,1903,1989,2002,2008,2503,2703,2810,2826,2854,2868,3040,3097,3603,3628,3682,3731,4312,5184,5621,6334,6610,6643,7128,8373],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.4018535447685214,4.885490627496221,1.7064694353107215,1.7003182735607676,1.834162586674748,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,2.127032521151058,1.8950689206770979,2.0545557924622586,2.1405462403177813,2.159084361316692,2.2466628996789315,2.1653408989309972,2.2323930368088845,2.3409902041158843,4.581473037857885,2.34599021453259,2.2844323215331563,2.332712011146513,2.348499626138016,2.5001408943598484,2.5040471493269134,2.571852579609833,2.47

{"value":"2005 gave us the very decent \"gore porn\" flick Hostel, and 2006 gave us Live Feed; a not so decent rip-off of Hostel. Live Feed follows pretty much the same formula as Eli Roth's earlier film, except this time the dumb kids are in Asia rather than central Europe. The plot focuses on these dumb kids, and one of them has annoyed one of the locals so they find themselves in trouble. The locals decide to lock them all in a theatre, and kill them. Despite the fact that I'd heard some less than favourable things about this film before seeing it, I still hoped that it might be at least half decent because director Ryan Nicholson previously made the very decent 45 minute rape and revenge film 'Torched', but this film falls down simply because most of it is either ridiculous or boring. The film is obviously trying to hark back to the good old days of Grindhouse cinema (which Hostel did, successfully), but it really doesn't come off. Surprisingly, considering Nicholson's previous work in special effects - not even the gore is impressive...although it is a lot better than the acting!

{"value":"A hint I think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread.<br /><br />I was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it \"mandatory\" or \"compulsory\".<br /><br />I think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizing.<br /><br />The Global Warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to \"do right\". It appeals particularly to more \"liberal\" leaning people because it doesn't have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to \"be good\" going.<br /><br />And that's the problem with the film. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful one at that. He just can't help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would. The political appeal is just too great.<br /><br />And there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance, reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to \"do right\".<br /><br />Another interesting question is how did the Environmental movement get hijacked by such people?","finished_norm":["a","hint","i","think","mai","be","gather","by","the","variou","comment","on","thi","threadbr","br","i","be","quit","amaz","at","the","numb","of","peopl","who","like","thi","film","who","want","to","make","it","mandatori","or","compulsorybr","br","i","think","thi","give","u","a","littl","bite","of","insight","into","the","reason","thi","film","and","the","issu","underli","it","be","so","polarizingbr","br","the","global","warm","issu","appeal","a","lot","to","peopl","who","want","to","forc","other","to","do","right","it","appeal","particularli","to","much","liber","lean","peopl","becaus","it","doe","not","have","to","do","with","bedroom","moral","which","be","what","usual","get","conserv","who","want","to","forc","you","to","be","good","goingbr","br","and","that","the","problem","with","the","film","al","gore","be","a","politician","and","a","veri","success","on","at","that","he","just","ca","not","help","himself","from","appeal","to","that","peopl","who","want","to","forc","other","to","do","a","thei","would","the","polit","appeal","be","just","too","greatbr","br","and","there","we","be","leav","with","a","scientif","issu","that","mai","be","of","huge","import","reduc","to","a","polit","issu","appeal","to","that","in","the","bodi","polit","with","a","predilect","to","forc","other","to","do","rightbr","br","anoth","interest","question","be","how","do","the","environment","movem","get","hijack","by","such","peopl"],"filtered":["hint","think","mai","gather","variou","comment","thi","threadbr","br","quit","amaz","numb","peopl","like","thi","film","want","make","mandatori","compulsorybr","br","think","thi","give","u","littl","bite","insight","reason","thi","film","issu","underli","polarizingbr","br","global","warm","issu","appeal","lot","peopl","want","forc","right","appeal","particularli","much","liber","lean","peopl","becaus","doe","bedroom","moral","usual","get","conserv","want","forc","good","goingbr","br","problem","film","al","gore","politician","veri","success","ca","help","appeal","peopl","want","forc","thei","polit","appeal","greatbr","br","leav","scientif","issu","mai","huge","import","reduc","polit","issu","appeal","bodi","polit","predilect","forc","rightbr","br","anoth","interest","question","environment","movem","get","hijack","peopl"],"filtered2":["hint","think","mai","gather","variou","comment","threadbr","quit","amaz","numb","peopl","like","want","make","mandatori","compulsorybr","think","give","u","littl","bite","insight","reason","issu","underli","polarizingbr","global","warm","issu","appeal","lot","peopl","want","forc","right","appeal","particularli","liber","lean","peopl","becaus","doe","bedroom","moral","usual","get","conserv","want","forc","good","goingbr","problem","al","gore","politician","veri","success","ca","help","appeal","peopl","want","forc","polit","appeal","greatbr","leav","scientif","issu","mai","huge","import","reduc","polit","issu","appeal","bodi","polit","predilect","forc","rightbr","anoth","interest","question","environment","movem","get","hijack","peopl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,12,14,15,18,22,23,30,37,46,60,72,73,74,81,95,112,120,121,154,167,185,265,280,338,358,376,378,444,497,516,532,575,600,685,690,806,878,942,1303,1317,1578,1659,1887,1922,2013,2201,2835,2963,3031,3049,3240,3437,3797,4628,4856,6272,6455,6580,7240],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,12,14,15,18,22,23,30,37,46,60,72,73,74,81,95,112,120,121,154,167,185,265,280,338,358,376,378,444,497,516,532,575,600,685,690,806,878,942,1303,1317,1578,1659,1887,1922,2013,2201,2835,2963,3031,3049,3240,3437,3797,4628,4856,6272,6455,6580,7240],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,2.133457220525776,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,6.824238636878905,1.3364419891718522,5.950617285909722,3.311542587503466,1.838176641236591,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,1.9486336368009016,1.949757232424728,2.0323326556775485,2.2466628996789315,2.2044500422972613,2.2190595059394194,2.348499626138016,2.4609576687888097,2.518833027372001,2.73529586597515,2.8028805344481915,11.888382974947381,3.2030824725120812,3.1569204307489187,3.130944944345658,3.2535472664379905,3.342254038012865,3.442099372982581,3.4446025032006995,10.894336634140501,3.558633189238533,3.607563812710113,18.172356328150187,15.522417340675783,4.067587905068712,3.9739784059464043,4.370968887063596,4.646072177308517,4.613282354485526,4.688631791727313,4.900964426937307,5.064116067623542,4.9227044135737135,5.00274712124725,5.444579873526289,5.482320201509136,5.7446844659766265,5.541743621979936,5.626901430320244,5.850044981634453,6.032366538428407,5.999576715

{"value":"As someone who lived through,and still remembers that decade vividly,if the actual '70s had been half this funny and (semi)normal,they would have been so much more enjoyable.Actual kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright-eyed and normal as these kids did.The country's youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that '60s rebellion that it spawned,especially in the behavior department;the petulance,the smugness,the self-righteousness,the childishness,the unreasonableness of them - none of the characters exhibit any of that.<br /><br />Someone compared to \"Happy Days\",and I can see why:They were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast,and they both offer only surface ,cliched depictions of the actual eras,not even close to the full scope of it,just showing the obvious things - the fashions,toys,music,contraptions,etc,and that's it.For those too young to remember,or weren't born then,trust me,the '70s weren't like that,any more than \"Happy Days\" were like the actual '50s,as \"M*A*S*H*\" didn't accurately portray life at a US Army medical base during

{"value":"David Mamet is a very interesting and a very un-equal director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.<br /><br />So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.<br /><br />This is were the flaws of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical and hard to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is pathetic. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but disappoints from a human emotional perspective.<br /><br />Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, but the flaws of the story are

{"value":"Ludicrous. Angelic 9-year-old Annakin turns into whiny brat 19-year-old Annakin, who somehow seems appealing to Amidala, 5 years his senior. Now 22-year-old Jedi warrior hero Annakin has a couple of bad dreams, and so takes to slaughtering children, his friends, and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a) his precious wife might really die, and b) only he can prevent this. Ludicrosity squared.<br /><br />I think the people who like this movie are not paying attention. The story is ridiculous. The characters are unbelievable (literally, not the perverted sense of \"fantastic\", \"wonderful\", etc.).<br /><br />Obi-wan Kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series, but in the climax, he hacks off Annakin's legs, lets him burn in the lava, and leaves him to suffer. Doesn't anyone think that's a little out of character? Not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living, as it turns out.<br /><br />I was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations.

{"value":"Dolph Lundgren stars as a templar who comes to New York when a key that unlocks the anti-Christ is found by an archaeologist, of course the demon is only a couple miles behind Dolph and isn't killed so easily as he transfers from body to body. (Like Fallen without the suspense) Of course Lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable. I admit to being a fan of Dolph Lundgren, like Steven Seagal and Jean-Claude Van Damme, I try to watch his movies whenever they're on TV. I caught The Minion and boy was I ever disappointed. This movie is utterly terrible. With action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena. Worst of all is Lundgren's woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest (!) all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of Fallen (Which was good) and End Of Days (Which was bad but better than this) overall this movie is the worst movie I've seen from Dolph Lundgren.

{"value":"I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was great on Top Model and was really glad when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he seems like a great guy. But this show just made me SICK! I'm so angry at both of them for what happened on that show. I don't care that they were different ages, I know age can't stand between love. But Adrianne, you had been together for ONLY SEVEN MONTHS. It didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't proposed. And I don't see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they're ready. If it's meant to be, then why not just ENJOY each other's company and love each other, and let it come naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary, it's stupidly obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway! You've been through two failed marriages, how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit? I hope the relationship lasts, but I really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons. Maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the

We also must mention the hooters of jewel Shepard, who play a hooker in the recent film The Cooler.<br /><br />Lots of blood and action with knives and swords and martial arts among topless dancers in a bar, in a whorehouse, and on a boat load of martial artists heading to some zombie island where bad martial artists go to die or something like that.<br /><br />Tops and bottoms come off easily and frequently as travelers are well lubricated thanks to the boat owner.<br /><br />Then disaster strikes as their boat is destroyed and they land on the zombie island where mas monks sacrifice young girls to the dead martial artists to bring them back to life.<br /><br />Just when you thought it had everything, there are piranhas in the water.

{"value":"Wow...speechless as to the making of this film, I can't say much. The coverbox at the local videostore should've said it all...nothing but 6 actors/actresses who get lost on the set of Scream and decide to shoot a movie!<br /><br />The acting was apparently not in the budget, but they were able to afford nudity and good-looking actors! Style over substance almost makes its mark here, except most of these acting-class failures keep forgetting that there is a plot that needs to go somewhere when they were reading this script. After only 4 or 5 kills by the so-called masked murderer and a confusing tie-in plot about a Murder Club which the dumb lead actress thinks is a real club that she can join (only if she can get over a girl bumping into her car), you want to stab your hands with the nearest sharp object to remind yourself never to get overly excited by a possibly good movie such as this.<br /><br />I feel bad for the people who bought this film and can't find anyone to take it off their hands. Another example of what's wrong with the growing number of straight to video horror releases with no thought put into the essentials.

{"value":"I buy or at least watch every Seagall movie. He came out with a handful of good movies then descending into poor stories, bad camera work and a walk-thru persona, he nearly lost me. A few movies ago he remembered how to make a decent movie. Now he's forgotten again. This film is seriously dark (on any level you care to name). There is a lot of slash & gash going on here with no discernible purpose unless it's meant as a warning against the military.<br /><br />Seagall may have had a stand-in for many of his scenes as it was often too dark to tell and someone else's voice was used most of the time. Sadly the only interesting character was the bad guy who killed his guard to escape custody & then proceeded to raise havoc all over the place. Okay since when do we place an armed guard in the holding room with a prisoner? Anyway this bad guy was at least colorful, and very focused. There's lots of gore if you like that king of thing. It looked to me like the bad guys tore the same gash every time. I'm just glad they didn't suck the blood from their hapless victims. I harken you back to my summary.

{"value":"... mainly because Ju-on 2 boasts an outrageous FORTY minutes' worth of material literally taken straight out of the first Ju-on - and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes, that leaves you with 36 original minutes' worth of film. Ho-hum. I found that deeply irritating - as if viewers simply wouldn't remember the same stuff! - not to mention dull, having to watch it all over again.<br /><br />OK, that complaint aside, the byline for Ju-on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie, which frankly, over 36 minutes, simply doesn't go far enough to making any kind of sense of the original's highly convoluted storyline.<br /><br />There are, however, some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been, had it had some time to develop; and some of the questions raised by the original - some, but not all - are answered.<br /><br />So in conclusion - if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story, go for it - but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fast-forward button for forty minutes.","finished_norm":["mainli","becaus","juon","boast","a","outrag","forti","minut","worth","of","materi","liter","take","straight","out","of","the","juon","and","when","you","consid","that","the","sequel","onli","run","for","minut","that","leav","you","with","origin","minut","worth","of","film","hohum","i","find","that","deepli","irrit","a","if","viewer","simpli","would","not","rememb","the","same","stuff","not","to","mention","dull","have","to","watch","it","all","over","againbr","br","okai","that","complaint","asid","the","bylin","for","juon","be","that","it","be","suppos","to","explain","a","lot","of","the","unansw","question","from","the","movi","which","frankli","over","minut","simpli","doe","not","go","far","enough","to","make","ani","kind","of","sens","of","the","origin","highli","convolut","storylinebr","br","there","be","howev","some","realli","nice","new","horror","sequenc","which","show","how","good","the","film","mai","have","be","have","it","have","some","time","to","develop","and","some","of","the","question","rais","by","the","origin","some","but","not","all","be","answeredbr","br","so","in","conclus","if","you","love","the","origin","movi","and","want","to","see","some","far","develop","on","the","stori","go","for","it","but","just","rememb","to","keep","your","remot","control","to","hand","with","your","finger","on","the","fastforward","button","for","forti","minut"],"filtered":["mainli","becaus","juon","boast","outrag","forti","minut","worth","materi","liter","take","straight","juon","consid","sequel","onli","run","minut","leav","origin","minut","worth","film","hohum","find","deepli","irrit","viewer","simpli","rememb","stuff","mention","dull","watch","againbr","br","okai","complaint","asid","bylin","juon","suppos","explain","lot","unansw","question","movi","frankli","minut","simpli","doe","go","far","enough","make","ani","kind","sens","origin","highli","convolut","storylinebr","br","howev","realli","nice","new","horror","sequenc","show","good","film","mai","time","develop","question","rais","origin","answeredbr","br","conclus","love","origin","movi","want","see","far","develop","stori","go","rememb","keep","remot","control","hand","finger","fastforward","button","forti","minut"],"filtered2":["mainli","becaus","juon","boast","outrag","forti","minut","worth","materi","liter","take","straight","juon","consid","sequel","onli","run","minut","leav","origin","minut","worth","hohum","find","deepli","irrit","viewer","simpli","rememb","stuff","mention","dull","watch","againbr","okai","complaint","asid","bylin","juon","suppos","explain","lot","unansw","question","frankli","minut","simpli","doe","go","far","enough","make","ani","kind","sens","origin","highli","convolut","storylinebr","howev","realli","nice","new","horror","sequenc","show","good","mai","time","develop","question","rais","origin","answeredbr","conclus","love","origin","want","see","far","develop","stori","go","rememb","keep","remot","control","hand","finger","fastforward","button","forti","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,8,11,13,17,18,22,27,28,31,37,38,46,54,59,69,72,74,83,87,93,101,113,122,134,137,149,173,191,201,219,235,262,279,285,290,317,320,349,361,367,378,387,395,537,548,824,883,896,897,936,956,958,1044,1210,1333,1739,1905,2108,2258,2318,2549,2560,3252,3303,3472,4623,6689,7309],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,8,11,13,17,18,22,27,28,31,37,38,46,54,59,69,72,74,83,87,93,101,113,122,134,137,149,173,191,201,219,235,262,279,285,290,317,320,349,361,367,378,387,395,537,548,824,883,896,897,936,956,958,1044,1210,1333,1739,1905,2108,2258,2318,2549,2560,3252,3303,3472,4623,6689,7309],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.655771293751733,1.8113893252729412,9.346627224600361,8.508130084604232,1.9209463754160525,1.9486336368009016,2.292318797740072,2.115024371522662,2.035389827120098,4.197164082437498,2.1521782565202803,2.2489347673732487,2.2443961816702407,2.2939035841256437,2.3253197803590226,2.4368824319140248,2.5460113484259455,5.122871637503154,5.158418835671083,2.6457189377809835,2.726701583487816,2.7910771187233068,2.808171552082607,5.7225627547931115,2.8529247828056143,5.87659672830711,3.0568369721919364,3.0399731661399314,3.0791938792932125,6.261889888691316,3.360519385990158,3.153168081130368,3.424750734647968,3.459754308221302,3.9081109809587793,3.8614098879127985,3.8844878351953436,3.8844878351953436,3.9

{"value":"When a movie like \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" brings in over $75 million it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society. Either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from trash like this or maybe I'm just not realizing how many people this kind of no-effort trash will appeal to.<br /><br />Hollywood has had no incentive to make good movies since if it puts out trash then people will see it anyways since there is nothing else on screen. This is that. I walked out despite getting a free movie pass. The dialogue could not be dumber. The stunts could not be more over-the-top and outrageous. Perhaps this \"bigger that big\" image appeals to Texans but it didn't appeal to me nor anyone else in the theater. None of the \"big names\" were in this career-ending flick, except for Burt Reynolds, which says all you need to hear. Jessica Simpson -- don't make me laugh.<br /><br />I wouldn't even recommend this film for video, even if you were desperate. This was all about fooling the public to make enough money after opening day to equal or do better than it cost through marketing. They did despite the public being forewarned.

{"value":"Two old men sitting on a park bench . I don`t really have a problem with this scene - Only problem is that it`s not a scene it`s the entire movie<br /><br />Yup movies don`t get anymore low concept than this . They also don`t get anymore boring than this either , but there`s worse to come because these two old men are chalk and cheese . One is Nat Moyer who is Yiddish communist while the other is Midge Carter a former golden gloves champion who`s also black . Let me see now , a Jew and a black man sitting on a park bench getting along fine . Well I guess it`s possible though unlikely , but if this film has such an inoffensive scenario why play up to the Jewish stereotype ? Why make them loud tribilistic rabble rousers who take hebrew oaths ? Slightly ironic that the Jews seen at the start of the movie are exactly the type of Jews seen in Nazi propaganda films in the 1930s<br /><br />Stereotypes aside moi dearz the problem with I`M NOT RAPPAPORT is that it`s written for an entirely different meduim than cinema , it`s based on a stage play and it shows .

{"value":"The book is fantastic, this film is not. There is no reason this film could not have embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book. Hell, total recall was released a few years later and that did a good job of it, even a clockwork orange released in the 70s did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world. The bleak German expressionistic colours, the black and white footage from the vision screens, there is no reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984. The main character is in a white collar writing job yet he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage. This film decides to take a mock-communistic approach to set design, atmosphere and theme, yet the novel did not necessarily dictate a communist, worship-the-humble-worker theme itself. This book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever before. I could not watch more than 20 minutes of this crap. The soundtrack is annoying, the lack of foresight is annoying, this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or believability when that is exactly what is required to hammer the novel's

{"value":"I was excited to see a sitcom that would hopefully represent Indian Candians but i found this show to be not funny at all. The producers and cast are probably happy to get both bad and good feed back because as far as they are concerned it's getting talked about! I was ready for some stereotyping and have no problem with it because stereotypes exist for a reason, they are usually true. But there really wasn't anything funny about these stereotypical characters. The \"fresh of the boat\" dad, who doesn't understand his daughter. The radical feminist Muslim daughter (who by the way is a terrible actress), and the young modern Indian man trying to run his mosque as politically correct as he can (he's a pretty good actor, i only see him getting better).<br /><br />it is very contrived and the dialog doesn't flow that well. there was so much potential for something like this but sadly i think it failed, and don't really care to watch another episode.<br /><br />I did however enjoy watching a great Canadian actress Sheila McCarthy again, she's always a treat and a natural at everything she does, too bad her daughter in the
