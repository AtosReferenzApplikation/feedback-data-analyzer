{"value":"This movie was horrible. I watched it three times, and not even the whole thing. It's just impossible to watch, the story line sucks, it's depressing, and utterly disgusting. I don't write spoilers for anything, so if you want to know why it's so disgusting, see it for yourself. The only good thing about this movie was John Savage, his dialogue at the beginning, and some funny parts in the movie. The little kid in this movie is annoying, and the whole situation is bullshit. I saw this movie at movie stores around America, so I assumed it would be a good movie. Jesus Christ, was I wrong!!!! The acting is all horrible, and the nudity itself is lame and nasty. Another thing is, Starr Andreef, the other main character, hasn't been in such bad movies in the past, in fact, she was in some pretty good ones. Same with John Savage. This movie

{"value":"Redundant, everlasting shots, useless shots, useless scenes are what you will find in this film. In other words, it seemed technically poor to me. The musical bits are amateurishly directed (no synchronization in the would-be dancing, badly post-synchronized, bad and obvious improvisation of the actors from time to time, etc). <br /><br />The film is long and boring. Eventually, it makes few point and even less sense. <br /><br />There are some good ideas though. Some of the comic elements are actually efficient, especially the opening scene. However, the film gets worse and worse so that it is completely unbearable and impossible to understand by the end. <br /><br />The trailer I saw was very dynamic, that is not true for the film.

{"value":"This Drummond entry is lacking in continuity. Most of them have their elements of silliness, the postponed wedding, and so on. However, this has an endless series of events occurring in near darkness as the characters run from one place to another. The house seems more like a city. There's also Leo G. Carrol who is such an obvious suspect who no-one seems to even look at. He is a stranger and acts rather suspicious, but Drummond and the folks don't seem to pick up on anything. Still, it as reasonably good action and a pretty good ending.<br /><br />I know that Algie is supposed to be a comic figure, but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes flicks, he is so buffoonish that it's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence being around him.

{"value":"The name (Frau) of the main character is the German word for \"Woman\". I don't know if that was intentional or not, but if sure got some giggles from the German audience at the Fantasy Film Festival last year, when it was shown.<br /><br />But those were the only giggles the movie got. Not that it was aiming for giggles, it's a horrible movie for heaven's sake! A horrible movie in more than one meaning. It's a shame that a premise like that was wasted with horrible even unbearable moments for the viewer (definetely not for the faint of Heart!!)! And it wasn't even necessary to show all the things that are shown. I'm not even going into a moral obligation (because movies don't really have that kind of task or function) discussion of what is shown here, but this is a new low on the whole \"torture movement\"

{"value":"It was all over with the slashers around 88 so it was time for the cheesy rip offs of those older movies. The Brain is well done, the script reminded me of Videodrome but then in a more cheesy way as said before. The acting can go through with it. But it's the effects that makes you laugh, the so called Brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown. The opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching, the hallucinations are really nicely done and reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street, remember the telephone coming alive.... Some how you keep watching this flick, waiting what is happening next. It's viewable for all freaks out there cause there isn't any gore in it and as said the blood isn't there neither but there is nudity for the perverts.

{"value":"I purchased this film for $5 in a bargain bin at my local video store for one reason only, Chase Masterson, but I should have crumbled up the five, thrown it in a toilet and flushed. The film is about a bunch of twenty somethings that peaked in high school and reunite on the anniversary of their idiot friends death, who got drunk and wandered into the woods and died. There problem is a reptilian monster is hunting them down one by one. The acting is abysmal, these worthless people were apparently cast offs on shows like 90210 and Dawsons Creek. The directing was on par with a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old. The entire set looks like someone's backyard in Malibu. The people on here that have praised this film are obviously friends of the director and/or actors.

{"value":"I saw this movie last year in Media class and I have to say I really hated it. I was in year 10 (and aged 15) so that may have has something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a terrible book, and I also hated it.<br /><br />But 1984, I think it was the most disturbing movie I have ever seen, and I think that George Orwell is one of the most deranged people ever to live on this planet. I'm sorry to everyone who loved his work, but I unfortunately did not. The themes in the movie were well portrayed, but the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it were not to my standards.

{"value":"You have to admire Brad Sykes even if you don't particularly want to, a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions. But keeps on doing it all the same. Even the half-hearted praise than surrounds his Camp Blood films is given grudgingly and I'm as guilty of this as anyone. Brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix, a neat idea, a kooky character, whatever, but without the funds to take it further than base level, he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be. Joe Haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as Ebenezer Jackson and its a credit to Sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film.

{"value":"This movie is a joke. I mean a \"ha ha\" funny joke. Why? Because the only redeeming thing about it was the good laugh I got at the sheer ridiculousness of nonsensical, inane plot and horrible acting. Wow!<br /><br />Within this movie there are so many unanswered questions... for example; why do these women become zombies and how? Why are there four black women who are zombie's \"caretakers\" and what is their purpose? Since when does 6 people make up a \"nation\" of Zombies? And is smeared black eye mascara \"scary\" to anyone, anywhere? Even a 2 year old?<br /><br />And lastly; Why was this movie made at all? Why? why? why? No answer? That's what I thought.<br /><br />On the demand channel they actually issued this comment after the synopsis of the movie: We apologize for this movie in advance\" LOL.

{"value":"Sorry my fellow Nevada City neighbors, but this one is bad.<br /><br />Brian must have had too much botox because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire movie.<br /><br />Alice looked like she had a board strapped to her backside. She was stiff throughout the movie.<br /><br />I looked up both Alice and Brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work. I would have guessed that they were first-year students.<br /><br />Ed Asner and Peter Jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line. Ed certainly has not lost his charisma. I wish I'd taken the time to meet him while he was here.<br /><br />I love the snow scenes and scenes of stores and the church because I've been there. I make Nevada City my home and was anxiously awaiting the premiere.

{"value":"This movie starts slow, then tapers off. After watching for about an hour, and seeing absolutely nothing happen, I walked out. I mean, nothing happened. Zero. Zip. Nada. There is no story. The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know. The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a \"motion\" picture. There is no motion. I could have told the same \"story\" with a couple still pictures with captions. The script is a joke. It's just awful. I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it. My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching \"Love In the Time of Money\", but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader. I could have been the first to walk out, but I waited a bit too long.

{"value":"Here is one of those educational short films made to learn the unknown people out there about facts of life. This time the target audience is preteen girls, the fact of life is menstruation. This animated film, created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with some sponsoring from Kotex.<br /><br />It starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. With the help of animation and a female narrator it shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, work and why this all leads to menstruation. It is almost amazing, becoming the comic note here, how the subject of sex is avoided. Even the word is never mentioned although \"furtilized\" will pass once. I don't really know why I saw this, but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time, you might want to give it a

{"value":"I hate to even waste the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity. Hyung-Rae Shim is lucky that bad film-making isn't a capital crime or he'd be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster. I'm amazed that this film had a $75m budget, but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop, that Shim will hopefully, never get to make another movie the rest of the life and, therefore, not waste any more of filmgoers time. I would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by now.<br /><br />With the effects resources available to them, a great film could have been made with this budget. As usual, the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story. \"Transformers\" was another visual feast with a weak script, but this makes it look like

{"value":"Why take a show that millions of us watched and loved as children and make a complete joke of it? They ask why Hollywood isn't making the money it used to. Because they put out garbage and pay actors huge amounts of money to be garbage men and ask us to pay $10 to see their garbage. The TV show was what it was, good people in bad situations where the good IL' boys come out on top. It wasn't Gone with the Wind but it was fun. This movie is garbage! Hollywood can't come up with anything original so they take something that was good and ruin it for some $$$$. I only hope that this movie makes 10x's less than it cost to make. The only one's to have any fun with this crap are the guys who got to drive the General Lee. The audience is the victim.<br /><br />Don't see it, watch the reruns of the TV show instead.

{"value":"This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen I don't really know why Just your run-of-the-mill stories about guy who is about to get married, and starts to fancy someone else instead. Story has been told a thousand times. Nothing new or innovative about it at all.<br /><br />I don't really know what was wrong with this film. Most of the time when these kinds of actors/actresses get together to make a film that have already been made a million times before, it's really entertaining. There are usually little clever thing in them that aren't really in any other. For some reason, this one just doesn't hold your attention. You can pick out some funny parts, or clever ideas in it, but for some reason they're just not funny, nor clever in any way I wish I new how to explain it, but I don't Just don't waste your time on

She knows exactly what's going on at that point, plus she has a video tape as proof. Instead, she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying \"I know everything, I have proof! You didn't expect proof, did you?!\" Then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if he's going to harm her. Well DUH! Of course he's going to harm you idiot, you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything.

I can understand her fear; fearing that this 3rd rate stinker would somehow be released to the general public. Also, I'm a fan of the likable Adam West. Again, as with Tina, Adam looks good and in great shape for a man his age. His acting here is passable, but the script is so bad, that it's difficult to even listen to the dialog.<br /><br />The movie is a rip-off of the classic Brando biker flick, The Wild Ones; out-law biker gang is out-of-control in a small hick-town. The bikers here look like a motley group and I sure wouldn't want them to date my sister. The acting is stiff and wooden, and the story-plot is as old as sand. Hellriders is hell to watch!","finished_norm":["how","sad","to","see","the","beauti","and","talent","tina","louis","reduc","to","make","thi","horribl","excus","for","a","film","tina","still","look","fit","and","attract","but","for","some","reason","seem","truli","frighten","i","can","understand","her","fear","fear","that","thi","rd","rate","stinker","would","somehow","be","releas","to","the","gener","public","conjur","i","be","a","fan","of","the","likabl","adam","west","again","a","with","tina","adam","look","good","and","in","great","shape","for","a","man","hi","ag","hi","act","here","be","passabl","but","the","script","be","so","bad","that","it","difficult","to","even","listen","to","the","dialogbr","br","the","movi","be","a","ripoff","of","the","classic","brando","biker","flick","the","wild","on","outlaw","biker","gang","be","outofcontrol","in","a","small","hicktown","the","biker","here","look","like","a","motlei","group","and","i","sure","would","not","want","them","to","date","my","sister","the","act","be","stiff","and","wooden","and","the","storyplot","be","a","old","a","sand","hellrid","be","hell","to","watch"],"filtered":["sad","see","beauti","talent","tina","louis","reduc","make","thi","horribl","excus","film","tina","still","look","fit","attract","reason","seem","truli","frighten","understand","fear","fear","thi","rd","rate","stinker","somehow","releas","gener","public","conjur","fan","likabl","adam","west","tina","adam","look","good","great","shape","man","hi","ag","hi","act","passabl","script","bad","difficult","even","listen","dialogbr","br","movi","ripoff","classic","brando","biker","flick","wild","outlaw","biker","gang","outofcontrol","small","hicktown","biker","look","like","motlei","group","sure","want","date","sister","act","stiff","wooden","storyplot","old","sand","hellrid","hell","watch"],"filtered2":["sad","see","beauti","talent","tina","louis","reduc","make","horribl","excus","tina","still","look","fit","attract","reason","seem","truli","frighten","understand","fear","fear","rd","rate","stinker","somehow","releas","gener","public","conjur","fan","likabl","adam","west","tina","adam","look","good","great","shape","man","ag","act","passabl","script","bad","difficult","even","listen","dialogbr","ripoff","classic","brando","biker","flick","wild","outlaw","biker","gang","outofcontrol","small","hicktown","biker","look","like","motlei","group","sure","want","date","sister","act","stiff","wooden","storyplot","old","sand","hellrid","hell","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,9,16,21,35,37,39,45,51,64,67,77,95,119,140,202,212,225,230,257,276,325,327,332,342,363,394,410,442,455,549,585,617,647,648,676,780,803,812,845,891,997,1090,1107,1248,1414,1439,1710,1929,2013,2049,2136,2565,3064,3187,3350,4137,4385,4906,5675,7601,8317],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,9,16,21,35,37,39,45,51,64,67,77,95,119,140,202,212,225,230,257,276,325,327,332,342,363,394,410,442,455,549,585,617,647,648,676,780,803,812,845,891,997,1090,1107,1248,1414,1439,1710,1929,2013,2049,2136,2565,3064,3187,3350,4137,4385,4906,5675,7601,8317],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,3.589841616087325,2.324031090670098,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.8162961064622165,1.7139899308309823,1.883428577602134,1.9570915389266579,1.9463902258768238,2.0323326556775485,2.1653408989309972,2.317169775997098,2.597304642813496,2.5983793339432615,2.641219492619754,2.7121382192999195,2.7602659523229094,2.7884729505849193,2.973659465713028,2.9674191958529437,2.9705344631698933,2.9705344631698933,3.0349689855553557,3.0967381889441223,3.2070272508030975,3.257696649984802,3.2787058260741455,3.4471119148061256,3.7165362186843414,3.5119855004467477,3.6746621462132825,3.6105180246075443,3.6105180246075443,3.7775721092707104,3.7636829971100436,7.905849993497144,3.831445099210862,3.8767358583910254,4.263079925052412,4.339813719283801,4.268777946167049,9.275546748987644,4.484804029712395,4.513582994262438,4.688631791727313,4.8184434032493035,4.9227044135737135,4.944927550358424,4.9676558014359795,5.290429193699031,5.426230734858092,6.137727054086234,5.695894301807195,18.89420911248424,6.1754673820690815,19.313494939609715,6.342521466732247,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.595892480738235E-4,1.5944782797301993E-4,1.5948719687345196E-4,1.5945513484534344E-4,1.5947022538244338E-4,1.594469488257991E-4,1.5949653904053567E-4,1.5942322572037174E-4,1.5944786167068837E-4,1.5961263375789464E-4,1.6087911354986371E-4,1.5944812503732375E-4,1.5959913248782452E-4,1.5961575996390642E-4,1.59543250691826

{"value":"We have an average family. Dad's a famous rapper, we have the \"rebelious teenage daughter\", the adopted white kid, and the cute little kid. And we have careless housemaid, what show has had a housemaid like that? Do we have a messed-up Brady Bunch? Yay! When it first came out I thought it was really cool, mostly because I was young. The music was bad. The raps were so bad and they were too g-rated. All of his raps were about his family and friends and problems. The dad was kind of the \"Danny from Full House\" type of dad. Always gave the advice out. But he wasn't a clean freak. They had a house-keeper for that. Remember? The plots were basically Lil' Romeo was in trouble of some sort, or... not that's it. Oh and maybe some preteen drama. Yeah that stuff is good. Not really. But its still a good show for kids.

{"value":"Like most people I love \"A Christmas Story\". I had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason--it is awful. Same locale, same narrator, same director but the warm fuzziness of the original was lacking. Charles Grodin was a poor choice to replace Darrin McGavin but I cannot imagine anyone being able to replace him. The story seems forced and lacks the sweetness of the original. The interaction with the neighbors, the Bumpuses, is ridiculous. In \"A Christmas Story\" Ralphie's obsession with the BB gun seems cute but his obsession in this movie is boring. Scud Farkus, the original neighborhood bully, is replaced in this film by yet another kid with braces and a weird hat but with little of the Scud Farkus menacing appeal.

{"value":"At first the movie seemed to be doing great, they had the characters profiles set...the plot seemed to be going in the right direction... however, as the movie progressed it seemed the director focused on the wrong kind of things...or just a lot was edited from the movie. The characters' identities changed for the worse within the movie. Also, there seemed to be a lot of implicit meaning -- in other words -- they had things within the movie that didn't seem to fit the movie itself. AND the title... no where in the movie does the title fit the movie...I suppose the title works for the previews.... Actors did well with what they had.....if they had a better director and writer, maybe this would have worked out better. But it didn't. So now there's a new terrible movie coming out this Friday.... My opinion!....don't waste your time or money.","finished_norm":["at","the","movi","seem","to","be","do","great","thei","have","the","charact","profil","setth","plot","seem","to","be","go","in","the","right","direct","howev","a","the","movi","progress","it","seem","the","director","focu","on","the","wrong","kind","of","thingsor","just","a","lot","be","edit","from","the","movi","the","charact","ident","chang","for","the","wrong","within","the","movi","conjur","there","seem","to","be","a","lot","of","implicit","mean","in","other","word","thei","have","thing","within","the","movi","that","do","not","seem","to","fit","the","movi","itself","and","the","titl","no","where","in","the","movi","doe","the","titl","fit","the","moviei","suppos","the","titl","work","for","the","preview","actor","do","good","with","what","thei","hadif","thei","have","a","well","director","and","writer","mayb","thi","would","have","work","out","well","but","it","do","not","so","now","there","a","new","terribl","movi","come","out","thi","fridai","my","opiniondont","wast","your","time","or","monei"],"filtered":["movi","seem","great","thei","charact","profil","setth","plot","seem","go","right","direct","howev","movi","progress","seem","director","focu","wrong","kind","thingsor","lot","edit","movi","charact","ident","chang","wrong","within","movi","conjur","seem","lot","implicit","mean","word","thei","thing","within","movi","seem","fit","movi","titl","movi","doe","titl","fit","moviei","suppos","titl","work","preview","actor","good","thei","hadif","thei","well","director","writer","mayb","thi","work","well","new","terribl","movi","come","thi","fridai","opiniondont","wast","time","monei"],"filtered2":["seem","great","charact","profil","setth","plot","seem","go","right","direct","howev","progress","seem","director","focu","wrong","kind","thingsor","lot","edit","charact","ident","chang","wrong","within","conjur","seem","lot","implicit","mean","word","thing","within","seem","fit","titl","doe","titl","fit","moviei","suppos","titl","work","preview","actor","good","hadif","well","director","writer","mayb","work","well","new","terribl","come","fridai","opiniondont","wast","time","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,8,10,18,20,25,29,32,34,35,39,41,48,51,58,72,87,88,89,102,113,121,122,126,149,163,166,258,264,278,287,348,619,672,676,1504,1608,1676,1974,4861,5377],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,8,10,18,20,25,29,32,34,35,39,41,48,51,58,72,87,88,89,102,113,121,122,126,149,163,166,258,264,278,287,348,619,672,676,1504,1608,1676,1974,4861,5377],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,2.559277576165403,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,7.31584506449567,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,3.3910232448024944,1.7139899308309823,3.731402629253362,3.841892750832105,2.115024371522662,2.0317223413467334,1.9940046109572438,2.087553710177271,2.1521782565202803,2.2190595059394194,2.2489347673732487,2.2391270689902285,2.3253197803590226,2.4000574358028657,2.4423870329693536,2.7061321952397077,8.273222095367146,2.8336934208777267,2.841890188081905,3.0103169565570433,3.5929222627171646,7.232905520254718,7.221036049215089,4.566029469634981,4.605250182788262,4.74221603786142,4.9909126636002465,6.101359409915359,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247365E-4,2.1540780663323992E-4,2.1546099248468382E-4,2.154176779332166E-4,2.1543806466120747E-4,2.1540661893957886E-4,2.1547361338862642E-4,2.1537456994793314E-4,2.1540785215747775E-4,2.1563045283100646E-4,2.1734141771276278E-4,2.1540820795554658E-4,2.1561221314088624E-4,2.1563467621359275E-4,2.1553671901055057E-4,2.1541852643227152E-4,2.1549263873662998E-4,2.1559405030503598E-4,2.154296475619732E-4,2.154288599298075E-4,2.156226709378491E-4,2.1545044370220882E-4,2.1545076976778384E-4,2.1558878983769225E-4,2.1542972527287163E-4,2.156372535802116E-4,2.1548363572753692E-4,2.1540732385964907E-4,2.155049803348708E-4,2.1557075556130387E-4,2.1545150052150507E-4,2.1556689165339274E-4,2.156727296156059E-4,2.1587290735061634E-4,2.154832633657563E-4,2.1541839577752034E-4,2.1549606627473255E-4,2.1544027352728254E-4,2.1537479982036332E-4,2.154295808469171E-4,2.1564547810166163E-4,2.155271829826658E-4,2.1556738289319749E-4,2.153855190001099E-4,2.1542963562520208E-4,2.1541831477197863E-4,2.1549123191840148E-4,2.1552859836735785E-4,2.154847718447857E-4,2.154506171277407E-4,2.1541884748491817E-4,2.1586020571993613E-4,2.154730530722389E-4,2.154295862490031E-4,2.15471899134233E-4,2.1540754425062423E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476606E-4,2.1541914990540827E-4,2.1540742129050469E-4,2.1557975239475935E-4,2.1549321327804532E-4,2.1540733124454664E-4,2.1538543124717904E-4,2.153637718628815E-4,2.155584948043906E-4,2.1541788389403305E-4,2

{"value":"This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. This is saying quite a bit, considering some of the choices I've made in film rentals.<br /><br />I got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone I went to high school with is topless in it. The topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to Roseanne sing Big Spender.<br /><br />The \"skits\" are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker-room gags, and it's such a blatant (and poor) rip-off of The Kentucky Fried Movie that

{"value":"Though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments, it is a definitely incorrect assumption. This is an adaptation of 9 SEEMINGLY unrelated stories from Giovanni Bocaccio's 14th century \"Decameron\" story collection.<br /><br />Set within a medieval Italian town's largely peasant population, it is a diatribe on the reality of sex (and its consequences) within that world and time. A realistic view of Life within this world, it sometimes feels like a journey back in time.<br /><br />Given the depicted human element of its time, one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists - as well as the ironies of Life, at times.

{"value":"I wish I could give this movie a zero. Cheesy effects and acting. The only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is. Lets start with the kid who plays Brian. What a geek! I couldn't believe the mullet! Then there was the talking to himself. I guess they couldn't just have the movie be silent, but still. Of course they had to have him skinny-dipping too, not something I wanted to see. But Jared gave a great performance, compared to the special effects department. Everything from the bear to the crash was something I could do myself, and better. I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production, seeing as the movie was not even called Hatchet. Finally, I do not think the writer had ever read the book, seeing as nothing was the same.

{"value":"Crude, some times crass - to me that's the summation of Madhur Bhandarkar's latest work - Page 3. He has no point of view - just shallow, funny digs at stereotypes. What is the movie about?? Is it about reporting a clan of people (so called Page 3 types) who are so busy socializing and progressing their profiles in life - that they have no time for anything else. And you are either in it or out of it. Is it that there is no press at all to report everyday incidents. Madhur Bhandarkar forgets that there is a main newspaper and Page 3 is just a supplement; perhaps an entertainer for checking out who's who and what's what. Don't mix the two. And then there is power play - that would happen in every walk of life.

{"value":"Whatever his name is (the writer and director) should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again. This one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time. Sometimes movies are bad in a way that they're actually sort of good. Not this one. This was so bad I got angry. Seriously. A drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script. What a waste. ALL the actors were completely uninspired to work at all, the CGI was barely acceptable, the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was, it's like he just decided, \"I want this to happen and this to happen, but I don't care how we got there, just shoot it and put it in. Whatever, I'm going back to my trailer to pick my nose, if anyone calls for me, I'm not here.\" Shame on you whatever your name is.

{"value":"There are often badly-matched couples (in the general sense of the term) -in Huston's movies :\"African Queen\" \"Heaven knows Mister Allison\" \"roots of Heaven\" \"Misfits\" ...\"The Barbarian and the geisha\" (check the title) is another good example,so to speak.It seems that Japanese stuff was trendy at the time as such works as \"Sayonara\" \" the world of Suzie Wong\" and \"the teahouse of the August moon\" bear witness. Huston's effort might be the worst of this rather bad lot(with the exception of \"Susie \" maybe).John Wayne perfectly fits in Ford's world ,in Huston's he's like a bull in a china shop.His Japanese partner is totally bland.Even the dramatic scenes (cholera epidemic) do not save the movie from absolute boredom.<br /><br />Only those utterly enamoured of Huston's every work need to choose this

{"value":"This is a poor film by any standard. The story in Match Point had a certain intrigue, and the direction and writing a certain fascination (Woody Allen mixing his own culture with that of the classic English murder and exploring what can be done with it).<br /><br />Scoop, however has none of this. It is poorly written, the two leads are hopelessly wooden and the story itself has no interest at all. The genre that it spoofs requires at least some sort of subplot with witty explanations and tie-ups (why are tarot cards and keys kept under French horns in locked rooms?).<br /><br />Allen's delightful and witty versions of various Hollywood genres (Curse of the Jade Scorpion/Purple Rose of Cairo etc) have given us so much pleasure over the years. Even Hollywood Ending had a great central idea.

{"value":"If you have ever seen a movie by Brian Avenet-Bradley and compares it to the feedbacks it gets on IMDb, you know that most of the comments and votes are faked. TRUST ME: you will be bored! People of the production team write their feedback themselves (sometimes they even admit it). But that's not enough: They also click constantly \"no\" whenever there is a negative comment on the movie. That's why negative critics are always placed behind the hyped ones.<br /><br />The movie itself is bad, bad, bad: bad acting, bad lighting, bad script, bad ending. Believe me now! If not, you will believe me later!<br /><br />Brian Avenet-Bradley might be quite a good business man. Otherwise it cannot be explained that he finds people who still finance his movies. (Okay, they are cheap, but nevertheless.)

{"value":"From a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was terrible. I found myself looking at the clock in theater hoping it would end and relieved after 80 long minutes that it mercifully did. Basically, five characters appear in the movie, A Son & Father, son's girl friend, and two male characters of the son's age who appear and then disappear without context or explanation. The movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another. There were a couple of brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the movie, the son's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation. The photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another man who was \"older\".

{"value":"My favorite memory of this show and the band was when I got together with a bunch of my friends which are NBB haters and had a big bonfire and we took a CD of their songs and the DVD of the movie and a bunch of pictures of the band members and threw them into the fire and danced a happy jig around the burning stuff while singing \"Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead\". That was the best thing about the show and this show is stupid with a capitol God this show sucks. I hate it so much. Get rid of the crappy car. You guys really suck! You really ruined the whole channel! No offence or anything but you guys need to get a life, I mean, really, who makes a stupid show with a stupid lead singer that can't even sing! You guys really sound horrible and need to get a life as hobos or something, except Roselina. She's really pretty.

{"value":"When a film is independent and not rated, such as the Hamiltons, I was expecting out of the norm, cut out your heart violence. I know that good movies don't always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, I visited the website, and I even convinced a few of my friends to pay $9.50 to see this god awful movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I am expecting horror, not Dawsons Creek with incestuous undertones. My expectations were extremely low for this film, yet the little expectations there was for the film were shot to hell once I saw that an hour had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someones finger. There were too many plot holes and left too much to the imagination. I regret not seeing Happy Feet.
