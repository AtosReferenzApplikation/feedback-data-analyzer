{"value":"For those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight, I first offer these four words: Don't waste your time! \"Chungking Express\" was shoddily filmed, slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a Hong Kong Burger King. I can't remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one-dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane! It's an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog (a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that \"tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to mop up\"). The same character is also seen carrying on a deep, meaningful rapport with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. The shaky, wandering, hand-held camera-work was another annoying feature I could have done without. And if that isn't enough to make you puke in your popcorn, we hear the old 60's ode \"California Dreaming\" by the Mamas and Papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence.<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company, though I cannot for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother. He was known to have remarked, \"I'm happy to love a movie this much.\" A lot of us, though, hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future.","finished_norm":["for","that","decid","whether","or","not","to","watch","thi","movi","and","be","read","thi","comment","for","insight","i","offer","thi","four","word","do","not","wast","your","time","chungk","express","be","shoddili","film","slap","togeth","quickli","and","seem","a","though","it","be","conceiv","in","it","entireti","by","someon","stand","in","line","at","a","hong","kong","burger","king","i","ca","not","rememb","ever","watch","a","film","with","a","assort","of","such","onedimension","charact","try","to","work","their","wai","through","a","script","thi","mundan","it","a","absurd","effort","with","philosoph","ridicul","dialog","a","man","wander","into","hi","flood","apart","and","offer","the","stun","revel","that","tear","can","be","dry","with","a","tissu","but","water","take","time","to","mop","up","the","same","charact","be","conjur","see","carri","on","a","deep","meaning","rapport","with","hi","towel","soap","stuff","anim","dirti","laundri","etc","the","shaki","wander","handheld","camerawork","be","anoth","annoi","featur","i","can","have","do","without","and","if","that","be","not","enough","to","make","you","puke","in","your","popcorn","we","hear","the","old","od","california","dream","by","the","mama","and","papa","blare","over","the","soundtrack","over","and","over","again","dure","a","particularli","lengthi","sequencebr","br","quentin","tarantino","be","respons","for","bring","thi","loser","to","america","through","hi","roll","thunder","product","compani","though","i","cannot","for","the","life","of","me","figur","out","why","a","man","with","hi","talent","would","bother","he","be","know","to","have","remark","i","be","happi","to","love","a","movi","thi","much","a","lot","of","u","though","hope","he","will","concentr","on","make","hi","audienc","happi","with","much","worthwhil","discoveri","in","the","futur"],"filtered":["decid","whether","watch","thi","movi","read","thi","comment","insight","offer","thi","four","word","wast","time","chungk","express","shoddili","film","slap","togeth","quickli","seem","though","conceiv","entireti","someon","stand","line","hong","kong","burger","king","ca","rememb","ever","watch","film","assort","onedimension","charact","try","work","wai","script","thi","mundan","absurd","effort","philosoph","ridicul","dialog","man","wander","hi","flood","apart","offer","stun","revel","tear","dry","tissu","water","take","time","mop","charact","conjur","see","carri","deep","meaning","rapport","hi","towel","soap","stuff","anim","dirti","laundri","etc","shaki","wander","handheld","camerawork","anoth","annoi","featur","without","enough","make","puke","popcorn","hear","old","od","california","dream","mama","papa","blare","soundtrack","dure","particularli","lengthi","sequencebr","br","quentin","tarantino","respons","bring","thi","loser","america","hi","roll","thunder","product","compani","though","life","figur","man","hi","talent","bother","know","remark","happi","love","movi","thi","much","lot","u","though","hope","concentr","make","hi","audienc","happi","much","worthwhil","discoveri","futur"],"filtered2":["decid","whether","watch","read","comment","insight","offer","four","word","wast","time","chungk","express","shoddili","slap","togeth","quickli","seem","though","conceiv","entireti","someon","stand","line","hong","kong","burger","king","ca","rememb","ever","watch","assort","onedimension","charact","try","work","wai","script","mundan","absurd","effort","philosoph","ridicul","dialog","man","wander","flood","apart","offer","stun","revel","tear","dry","tissu","water","take","time","mop","charact","conjur","see","carri","deep","meaning","rapport","towel","soap","stuff","anim","dirti","laundri","etc","shaki","wander","handheld","camerawork","anoth","annoi","featur","without","enough","make","puke","popcorn","hear","old","od","california","dream","mama","papa","blare","soundtrack","dure","particularli","lengthi","sequencebr","quentin","tarantino","respons","bring","loser","america","roll","thunder","product","compani","though","life","figur","man","talent","bother","know","remark","happi","love","lot","u","though","hope","concentr","make","audienc","happi","worthwhil","discoveri","futur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,10,26,31,33,35,36,39,44,45,48,54,67,72,73,75,77,81,86,89,93,107,112,125,139,145,168,181,190,216,239,249,250,258,270,271,274,276,277,280,290,305,361,377,401,415,429,432,496,497,507,541,572,597,605,606,607,621,770,795,796,808,830,834,844,846,882,915,928,1120,1228,1242,1343,1490,1524,1556,1578,1634,1833,2022,2117,2233,2386,2507,2523,2546,2693,2755,2879,3196,3265,3368,3384,3568,3937,4158,4237,4325,4346,4415,4436,4597,4639,4806,5368,6867,7268,7391,7488],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep by the MPAA. Whale Rider gets a PG-13 but this movie gets a PG? Please. Parents don't be fooled, taking an elementary school child to this movie is a huge mistake. There were numerous times I found myself being uncomfortable not just because the humor was inappropriate for kids, but also because it was totally out of the blue and unnecessary.<br /><br />But all that aside, The Cat in the Hat is still a terrible movie. The casting and overall look of the movie are the only saving graces. The beautiful Kelly Preston and the always likeable (or hateable in this case) Alec Baldwin are both good in their roles even though Preston is almost too beautiful for a role like this. The kids are conditioned actors and it shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that kept me watching and not throwing things at the screen.<br /><br />Did I mention there was an oversized talking cat in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely deplorable. I didn't like him as the voice of Shrek, and I truly believe now that Myers should not be allowed near the realm of children's films ever again. His portrayal of The Cat is a slightly toned down version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers.<br /><br />In the end, the cat should not have come, he should have stayed away, but he came, even if just for a day, he ruined 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife.<br /><br />The Cat in the Hat may be the worst kids movie ever.","finished_norm":["inappropri","the","pg","rate","that","thi","movi","get","be","yet","anoth","huge","misstep","by","the","mpaa","whale","rider","get","a","pg","but","thi","movi","get","a","pg","pleas","parent","do","not","be","fool","take","a","elementari","school","child","to","thi","movi","be","a","huge","mistak","there","be","numer","time","i","find","myself","be","uncomfort","not","just","becaus","the","humor","be","inappropri","for","kid","but","conjur","becaus","it","be","total","out","of","the","blue","and","unnecessarybr","br","but","all","that","asid","the","cat","in","the","hat","be","still","a","terribl","movi","the","cast","and","overal","look","of","the","movi","be","the","onli","save","grace","the","beauti","kelli","preston","and","the","alwai","likeabl","or","hateabl","in","thi","case","alec","baldwin","be","both","good","in","their","role","even","though","preston","be","almost","too","beauti","for","a","role","like","thi","the","kid","be","condit","actor","and","it","show","especi","with","dakota","fan","fan","be","the","onli","human","aspect","of","the","film","that","keep","me","watch","and","not","throw","thing","at","the","screenbr","br","do","i","mention","there","be","a","overs","talk","cat","in","thi","movi","mike","myer","be","absolut","deplor","i","do","not","like","him","a","the","voic","of","shrek","and","i","truli","believ","now","that","myer","should","not","be","allow","near","the","realm","of","child","film","ever","again","hi","portray","of","the","cat","be","a","slightli","tone","down","version","of","fat","bastard","and","austin","powersbr","br","in","the","end","the","cat","should","not","have","come","he","should","have","stai","awai","but","he","come","even","if","just","for","a","dai","he","ruin","minut","of","my","life","minut","of","person","anger","and","strifebr","br","the","cat","in","the","hat","mai","be","the","wrong","kid","movi","ever"],"filtered":["inappropri","pg","rate","thi","movi","get","yet","anoth","huge","misstep","mpaa","whale","rider","get","pg","thi","movi","get","pg","pleas","parent","fool","take","elementari","school","child","thi","movi","huge","mistak","numer","time","find","uncomfort","becaus","humor","inappropri","kid","conjur","becaus","total","blue","unnecessarybr","br","asid","cat","hat","still","terribl","movi","cast","overal","look","movi","onli","save","grace","beauti","kelli","preston","alwai","likeabl","hateabl","thi","case","alec","baldwin","good","role","even","though","preston","almost","beauti","role","like","thi","kid","condit","actor","show","especi","dakota","fan","fan","onli","human","aspect","film","keep","watch","throw","thing","screenbr","br","mention","overs","talk","cat","thi","movi","mike","myer","absolut","deplor","like","voic","shrek","truli","believ","myer","allow","near","realm","child","film","ever","hi","portray","cat","slightli","tone","version","fat","bastard","austin","powersbr","br","end","cat","come","stai","awai","come","even","dai","ruin","minut","life","minut","person","anger","strifebr","br","cat","hat","mai","wrong","kid","movi","ever"],"filtered2":["inappropri","pg","rate","get","yet","anoth","huge","misstep","mpaa","whale","rider","get","pg","get","pg","pleas","parent","fool","take","elementari","school","child","huge","mistak","numer","time","find","uncomfort","becaus","humor","inappropri","kid","conjur","becaus","total","blue","unnecessarybr","asid","cat","hat","still","terribl","cast","overal","look","onli","save","grace","beauti","kelli","preston","alwai","likeabl","hateabl","case","alec","baldwin","good","role","even","though","preston","almost","beauti","role","like","kid","condit","actor","show","especi","dakota","fan","fan","onli","human","aspect","keep","watch","throw","thing","screenbr","mention","overs","talk","cat","mike","myer","absolut","deplor","like","voic","shrek","truli","believ","myer","allow","near","realm","child","ever","portray","cat","slightli","tone","version","fat","bastard","austin","powersbr","end","cat","come","stai","awai","come","even","dai","ruin","minut","life","minut","person","anger","strifebr","cat","hat","mai","wrong","kid","ever"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,7,8,11,16,22,24,25,28,29,31,34,38,39,41,44,46,59,64,73,75,86,91,92,114,128,131,132,134,140,153,155,166,180,184,186,189,194,197,202,220,222,267,285,288,292,296,310,325,342,346,366,369,412,428,444,521,555,592,645,670,710,792,936,965,967,1040,1057,1149,1151,1327,1422,1593,1732,1976,1994,2019,2059,2155,2328,2453,2514,3039,3322,3654,3900,3993,4064,4555,4571,4726,6122,6246,6389,7211,7460,7709],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"Unashamedly ambitious sci-fi from Kerry Conran, for whom this is clearly a labour of love. Unfortunately it's just not that good. It all starts well enough - with an epic but restrained score, a mixture of Lucas and Hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a Spielberg. The movie also references many pulp sci-fi novels, serials and films as diverse as The Day The Earth Stood Still, Superman, Metropolis, Planet Of The Apes, The Iron Giant, Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me. The film however, fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons: the main being that it's such a labour of love, so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world, Conran actually forgets about making a movie. There is little to no tension, atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles, dinosaurs and race-against-time set-pieces. Even the noir elements fall flat. This is a broad way of looking at things though - those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake - the green-screen just looks like a video game half the time and it's obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards. The actors don't get to do much either - Jude Law is wooden, Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid, Angelina Jolie is wasted - and it's all because of an awful script - the sort that has to explain nearly everything. It is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday.

{"value":"I basically picked up this movie because I had seen Kitano Takashi's brilliant remake of Zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai tale which also starred Asano Tadanobu. These two movies are worlds apart. Zatoichi added humor and depth to its characters and subverted traditional samurai movie clichés. Gojoe goes off the deep end in the other direction.<br /><br />First off, I hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie. \"You cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior\" says almost every character in Benkei's presence, yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself. Instead of character development, we get bloated, boring, gory battle scenes. Asano's character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and doesn't know what he is doing there. I know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of Asano's appeal, but this movie doesn't serve him.<br /><br />A lot of the camera movement is nauseating. There is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera spins around the main characters until my wife and I felt like vomiting. The ending is ridiculous and rather anti-climatic. <br /><br />Its too bad that really good samurai movies aren't being made in Japan nowadays with this type of budget. The colors, scenery, and costumes were great, but the rest is just a loooong waste of time.

{"value":"actually, it was pretty funny... in a \"god, how the hell did this movie get made\" kind of way. if you life making fun of movies... which i kinda do... go ahead and watch it... but if you're actually thinking \"is this a good movie?\" eff off.<br /><br />this movie sucked from the very beginning scene with the worst acting i've ever seen in any movie.... usually they get five minutes into it before you realize \"this movie might suck\".. but no, you know right off the bat. this movie talks about edgar allen poe... never tried to explain it though, to people who haven't memorized poe's life story... so i don't know if any of what was said is fact.<br /><br />this movie is about a writer \"ethan poe\" hookin up with his cousin \"ann\".... they're both descendants of edgar allan poe... or are they?!? apparently, people give a what their ancestors did. this guy ethan poe is actually ethan \"usher\", who is supposed to be descendants from the story \"the house of usher\" that was written by edgar allen poe. ann's brother shows up sometimes to try to rape her... ann's also being stalked, at one point in the movie, by three different people on the same street

{"value":"By all the fawning people have been doing over Miike and his work. I sat through this flick tonight. I figured, if it's half as good as Ringu, as I assumed from these comments it might be, than it will be worth my time.<br /><br />No such luck.<br /><br />I'm all for finding the next great director (or writer), but I don't think Miike is the one. I don't have an NYU Masters of Fine Arts, but I do know this much: a horror movie has to have pacing. It also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie does.<br /><br />This film's pacing had me shaking my head. Some of the scenes near the end dragged so badly, I went to the fridge and lingered there while Kou Shibasaki stared at the camera for seemingly minutes on end, eyes wide and mouth agape. A famous director once made the claim, and I'm paraphrasing, a movie could be made by turning the camera on a beautiful woman and letting it roll. Kou is not a good enough actress to make that work. She stares paralyzed at the undead girl for more scenes than I care to remember. And she isn't the only one doing an impersonation of a deer in headlights; other cast members apparently feel the need to imitate this non-performance. The script gives them little room to do much else for far too much of the time.<br /><br />I like Asian cinema.

{"value":"I'll say one thing for Jeanette and Nelson--even when stranded in a mirthless, witless, painfully inept musical like this, there's still that twinkle in their eyes. Yes, the chemistry between the famous duo is there even when the material is paper thin. Even when the score is practically a throwaway, non-existent one depending on just a couple of catchy tunes. And even when the circumstances are so unbelievable--yes, even for a fantasy.<br /><br />Truth to tell, she has more chemistry with Nelson than with her own real-life husband Gene Raymond in SMILIN' THROUGH, which, nonetheless, was a considerably better film.<br /><br />Sorry, I love Jeanette and Nelson as much as the next fan, but this is the bottom of the heap. Jeanette is more than embarrassing in her one \"hep\" number with Binnie Barnes--and Nelson can only come up with a blank stare when faced with the most ludicrous situations.<br /><br />One can only wonder what this was like on Broadway in 1938. Surely, it must have had more wit and style than is evident in this weak MGM production. Edward Everett Horton fizzles in an unfunny role and none of the supporting players can breathe any semblance of life into this mess. It's like amateur night at the studio even with the few professionals sprinkled among the supporting cast.<br /><br />Summing up: Painfully clumsy rendering of a Rodgers and Hart musical. Can't recommend it, even for fans of MacDonald and Eddy. And even if Jeanette's close-ups still glow with her gossamer beauty, this film is jaw-droppingly

{"value":"This movie was absolute torture. First of all, it's a whopping 4+ hours long! True, the Kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for, but every single one of those battles need not have been shown. So maybe this is a documentary, not a commercial film as advertised. Sure didn't seem like it, as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws. The battle sequences were so poorly executed. I am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in Border. Each battle was the exact same as the previous. It was so predictable. (This might be a spoiler.) The whole army marches uphill, five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each (they also use the same cussword every time), one of the lead actors is shot, someone yells for a stretcher, the actor says, \"No, don't get a stretcher. That will take 6 men from the battalion,\" and then an actor dies. That exact same thing happens over and over and over again. Oh, and the songs are so bad and so long. The cast of the movie is too big for its own good. Despite such a long movie, none of the characters were well developed. The actresses had the most miniscule roles. They all are dressed and portrayed to be the same. Two of them were weeping synchronized. It was so comical.

{"value":"Like many others have commented before me here, I have to say that this movie is bad, but not the worst I've seen. There will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment, because I hate spoilers.<br /><br />I got a feeling I was watching an episode of a TV show or something, where they had gotten a hold of some extra $$$ to spend on CGI (I've seen worse of those)... All in all, it is quite an insult to the viewer, at least if you have ANY knowledge about computers and/or technology at all. There are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable, and I found myself just begging for it all to end - fast - halfway through. In addition, there are countless \"easy way out\" scenarios, which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being...<br /><br />This movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old \"Wargames\", and I think it's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel.<br /><br />Two stars from me, because of one thing and one thing only: the actors' performances aren't half-bad, considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with. Still, they should never have signed on to this movie. Not really a career-move, but I guess we all have bills to pay.<br /><br />To those of you who gave this movie top score...you have to be on the studio's payroll or something, that's my only explanation.<br /><br />To all who haven't seen this one: by all means, watch it and make up your own mind.

{"value":"In its way, Mister Foe (originally, and more appropriately, titled Hallam Foe  I can't see addressing its title character as \"mister\"), is a tribute to good acting. Both Jamie Bell, as Hallam, a physically attractive voyeur/creep, and Sophia Myles, as Kate, his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance, are convincing. The problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life. A young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives the way Hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp. And a woman in Kate's situation would be repulsed and frightened - she would probably call the police.<br /><br />These things are not, however, what happens in the movie. Poor Hallam's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he's been having an affair. Hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and lets he know it. She has sex with him. Kate's some kind of an employment person who places Hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games. She looks like his birth mother. It all ends happily with Hallam \"resolving\" his \"issues\".<br /><br />Forty some years ago, the play and brilliantly acted movie, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf, had a similarly optimistic ending, with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart. The trouble is, it doesn't always work that way, especially when nobody really cares. In Virginia Woolf, the ending's plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation.

{"value":"....because if I was, I may have wished it was me being crucified on a wooden cross! I'm still trying to determine the plot of this movie - and I'm being \"generous\" that there was even a plot to begin with. As previously mentioned, it's a misnomer on the cover of the DVD that Richard Dreyfuss is actually the star. He was barely in the movie. And if he was indeed \"frustrated\" as the back cover indicated he was, well, that's probably because he said YES to be in this disaster of a movie and couldn't get out of it! The movie really seemed to focus on Jared Martin, and what his role in the movie was supposed to be, other than the extreme close -ups, was not as big of a mystery as to what Gene Barry's role actually was - or wasn't. And speaking of \"big\"...whomever had the bright idea to fit Gene Barry in the Humpty Dumpty attire, which showcased his trousers literally pulled up to his chin, should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober. I could go on and on about how horrendous this movie was, from the dialogue not matching the \"actors'\" mouths (think Clutch Cargo), to the erratic jumping from scene to scene (again, being generous even calling the frames of pictures \"scenes\"), to the lack of a plot.... However, if you're into bad early 70s genre and if you're in a cottage in Michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kid & cat pictures, I recommend having a good bottle of wine before you embark on this weird ride of a movie because you'll be thankful that you may not remember it the next day!","finished_norm":["becaus","if","i","be","i","mai","have","wish","it","be","me","be","crucifi","on","a","wooden","cross","i","be","still","try","to","determin","the","plot","of","thi","movi","and","i","be","be","gener","that","there","be","even","a","plot","to","begin","with","a","previous","mention","it","a","misnom","on","the","cover","of","the","dvd","that","richard","dreyfuss","be","actual","the","star","he","be","bare","in","the","movi","and","if","he","be","ind","frustrat","a","the","back","cover","indic","he","be","good","that","probabl","becaus","he","sai","ye","to","be","in","thi","disast","of","a","movi","and","can","not","get","out","of","it","the","movi","realli","seem","to","focu","on","jare","martin","and","what","hi","role","in","the","movi","be","suppos","to","be","other","than","the","extrem","close","up","be","not","a","big","of","a","mysteri","a","to","what","gene","barri","role","actual","be","or","be","not","and","speak","of","bigwhomev","have","the","bright","idea","to","fit","gene","barri","in","the","humpti","dumpti","attir","which","showcas","hi","trouser","liter","pull","up","to","hi","chin","should","be","sentenc","to","hard","time","by","watch","thi","movi","stone","sober","i","can","go","on","and","on","about","how","horrend","thi","movi","be","from","the","dialogu","not","match","the","actor","mouth","think","clutch","cargo","to","the","errat","jump","from","scene","to","scene","again","be","gener","even","call","the","frame","of","pictur","scene","to","the","lack","of","a","plot","howev","if","you","re","into","bad","earli","genr","and","if","you","re","in","a","cottag","in","michigan","with","noth","but","thi","movi","and","a","box","of","kid","cat","pictur","i","recommend","have","a","good","bottl","of","wine","befor","you","embark","on","thi","weird","ride","of","a","movi","becaus","you","will","be","thank","that","you","mai","not","rememb","it","the","next","dai"],"filtered":["becaus","mai","wish","crucifi","wooden","cross","still","try","determin","plot","thi","movi","gener","even","plot","begin","previous","mention","misnom","cover","dvd","richard","dreyfuss","actual","star","bare","movi","ind","frustrat","back","cover","indic","good","probabl","becaus","sai","ye","thi","disast","movi","get","movi","realli","seem","focu","jare","martin","hi","role","movi","suppos","extrem","close","big","mysteri","gene","barri","role","actual","speak","bigwhomev","bright","idea","fit","gene","barri","humpti","dumpti","attir","showcas","hi","trouser","liter","pull","hi","chin","sentenc","hard","time","watch","thi","movi","stone","sober","go","horrend","thi","movi","dialogu","match","actor","mouth","think","clutch","cargo","errat","jump","scene","scene","gener","even","call","frame","pictur","scene","lack","plot","howev","re","bad","earli","genr","re","cottag","michigan","noth","thi","movi","box","kid","cat","pictur","recommend","good","bottl","wine","befor","embark","thi","weird","ride","movi","becaus","thank","mai","rememb","next","dai"],"filtered2":["becaus","mai","wish","crucifi","wooden","cross","still","try","determin","plot","gener","even","plot","begin","previous","mention","misnom","cover","dvd","richard","dreyfuss","actual","star","bare","ind","frustrat","back","cover","indic","good","probabl","becaus","ye","disast","get","realli","seem","focu","jare","martin","role","suppos","extrem","close","big","mysteri","gene","barri","role","actual","speak","bigwhomev","bright","idea","fit","gene","barri","humpti","dumpti","attir","showcas","trouser","liter","pull","chin","sentenc","hard","time","watch","stone","sober","go","horrend","dialogu","match","actor","mouth","think","clutch","cargo","errat","jump","scene","scene","gener","even","call","frame","pictur","scene","lack","plot","howev","re","bad","earli","genr","re","cottag","michigan","noth","box","kid","cat","pictur","recommend","good","bottl","wine","befor","embark","weird","ride","becaus","thank","mai","rememb","next","dai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,19,22,32,35,36,41,46,49,52,63,64,68,79,82,100,113,114,123,128,132,142,147,148,149,171,183,209,225,247,248,266,285,290,295,297,298,311,329,344,399,403,467,491,544,594,619,625,641,651,654,674,676,792,829,891,897,919,941,1002,1034,1100,1233,1254,1329,1366,1401,1419,1681,1924,2077,2100,2192,2781,2901,2959,4453,5490,5517,5584,6161,6338,6934,7092,7655,7793,8298,8431],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,19,22,32,35,36,41,46,49,52,63,64,68,79,82,100,113,114,123,128,132,142,147,148,149,171,183,209,225,247,248,266,285,290,295,297,298,3

{"value":"After seeing the previews I felt that this movie was going to be a nice improvement over that fast & furious series. So, I already expected it to have a lacking storyline, but at least this time it won't be loaded with a bunch of powerless civics with fart cans. Unfortunately, I was wrong. If you could only imagine a Fast & Furious movie with a worse story line than by all means this movie is for you.<br /><br />This is the absolute worst movie I had ever seen (I'm being nice - no I would not take baseball bat to my nuts like what others have said). Not only was the storyline non-existent, but the action was crap too. I guess the director thought that they could just throw bunch of females and exotic cars and then call it a movie. For an example, there is a point in the movie where the guy pushes the nos button and his Lamborghini takes off in the air and flies over a SLR McLaren to win. And after the bit where Eddy Griffin got in a fight with one of his \"girls\" (an Imus comment would work in this case) the girl asks to pull over and get out of the PLANE and of course they do in the middle of the desert. After this wonderful scene I couldn't take it anymore. So, I only got to see half of this monstrosity. This is the first movie I had ever walked out on. Afterwards, I had to stop for some drinks to kill all of my corrupted brain cells.<br /><br />I gave it a 1 because 0 is not an option.

{"value":":Spoilers:<br /><br />I was very disappointed in Love's Abiding Joy. I had been waiting a really long time to see it and I finally got the chance when it re-aired Thursday night on Hallmark. I love the first three \"Love\" movies but this one was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The whole movie was sad and depressing, there were way to many goofs, and the editing was very poor - to many scenes out of context. I also think the death of baby Kathy happened way to soon and Clarks appearance in the movie just didn't seem to fit. It seemed like none of the actors really wanted to be there - they were all lacking emotion. There seemed to be no interaction between Missie and Willie at all.<br /><br />I think the script writers should have went more by the book. It seems like every movie that's been made so far just slips further and further away from Janette Oke's writings. I mean in the movie they never mentioned a thing about the mine and the two boys or Clark getting hurt because of it. And I think Missie and Willies reactions to Kathy's death could have been shown and heard rather than just heard.<br /><br />Out of the four movies that have been made so far I'd have to say that Love's Abiding Joy is my least favorite. I hope with the next four movies that more of the book is followed and if Clarks character is in them I hope he's got a bigger part and I hope his part isn't so bland. I also hope there is more of Scottie and Cookie and maybe even Marty but who knows what the script writers will have in store next.","finished_norm":["spoilersbr","br","i","be","veri","disappoint","in","love","abid","joi","i","have","be","wait","a","realli","long","time","to","see","it","and","i","final","get","the","chanc","when","it","reair","thursdai","night","on","hallmark","i","love","the","three","love","movi","but","thi","on","be","noth","like","i","think","it","be","go","to","be","the","whole","movi","be","sad","and","depress","there","be","wai","to","mani","goof","and","the","edit","be","veri","poor","to","mani","scene","out","of","context","i","conjur","think","the","death","of","babi","kathi","happen","wai","to","soon","and","clark","appear","in","the","movi","just","do","not","seem","to","fit","it","seem","like","none","of","the","actor","realli","want","to","be","there","thei","be","all","lack","emot","there","seem","to","be","no","interact","between","missi","and","willi","at","allbr","br","i","think","the","script","writer","should","have","go","much","by","the","book","it","seem","like","everi","movi","that","be","make","so","far","just","slip","far","and","far","awai","from","janett","ok","write","i","mean","in","the","movi","thei","never","mention","a","thing","about","the","mine","and","the","two","boi","or","clark","get","hurt","becaus","of","it","and","i","think","missi","and","willi","reaction","to","kathi","death","can","have","be","show","and","hear","rather","than","just","heardbr","br","out","of","the","four","movi","that","have","be","make","so","far","i","have","have","to","sai","that","love","abid","joi","be","my","littl","favorit","i","hope","with","the","next","four","movi","that","much","of","the","book","be","follow","and","if","clark","charact","be","in","them","i","hope","he","get","a","big","part","and","i","hope","hi","part","be","not","so","bland","i","conjur","hope","there","be","much","of","scotti","and","cooki","and","mayb","even","marti","but","who","know","what","the","script","writer","will","have","in","store","next"],"filtered":["spoilersbr","br","veri","disappoint","love","abid","joi","wait","realli","long","time","see","final","get","chanc","reair","thursdai","night","hallmark","love","three","love","movi","thi","noth","like","think","go","whole","movi","sad","depress","wai","mani","goof","edit","veri","poor","mani","scene","context","conjur","think","death","babi","kathi","happen","wai","soon","clark","appear","movi","seem","fit","seem","like","none","actor","realli","want","thei","lack","emot","seem","interact","missi","willi","allbr","br","think","script","writer","go","much","book","seem","like","everi","movi","make","far","slip","far","far","awai","janett","ok","write","mean","movi","thei","never","mention","thing","mine","two","boi","clark","get","hurt","becaus","think","missi","willi","reaction","kathi","death","show","hear","rather","heardbr","br","four","movi","make","far","sai","love","abid","joi","littl","favorit","hope","next","four","movi","much","book","follow","clark","charact","hope","get","big","part","hope","hi","part","bland","conjur","hope","much","scotti","cooki","mayb","even","marti","know","script","writer","store","next"],"filtered2":["spoilersbr","veri","disappoint","love","abid","joi","wait","realli","long","time","see","final","get","chanc","reair","thursdai","night","hallmark","love","three","love","noth","like","think","go","whole","sad","depress","wai","mani","goof","edit","veri","poor","mani","scene","context","conjur","think","death","babi","kathi","happen","wai","soon","clark","appear","seem","fit","seem","like","none","actor","realli","want","lack","emot","seem","interact","missi","willi","allbr","think","script","writer","go","book","seem","like","everi","make","far","slip","far","far","awai","janett","ok","write","mean","never","mention","thing","mine","two","boi","clark","get","hurt","becaus","think","missi","willi","reaction","kathi","death","show","hear","rather","heardbr","four","make","far","love","abid","joi","littl","favorit","hope","next","four","book","follow","clark","charact","hope","get","big","part","hope","part","bland","conjur","hope","scotti","cooki","mayb","even","marti","know","script","writer","store","next"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,8,10,12,13,14,15,19,22,26,28,29,33,35,37,39,41,42,47,49,50,54,61,65,77,82,85,88,94,99,101,111,146,151,155,156,160,163,170,181,183,187,210,216,224,245,260,282,285,287,297,331,348,370,449,455,486,506,606,676,698,793,822,863,1028,1075,1336,1425,1470,1580,1773,1913,2180,2725,2746,2783,3869,4035,4103,4601,4655,7006],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,8,10,12,13,14,15,19,22,26,28,29,33,35,37,39,41,4

{"value":"I have never posted a review before, but I had to do it for this film! This film is SO bad, I found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody. But it ISN'T. It is truly, un-self-consciously BAD. This is a serious attempt that flops gloriously. Other reviewers have pointed out the film's many flaws, so I'll try not to repeat these, but I do urge you to see this film. Throughout it I was either speechless, literally gasping with disbelief, or rolling on the floor in hysterics. I haven't had so much fun watching a film in years. In fact, I'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it's the kind of movie that needs to be shared.<br /><br />My favorite parts: -- When Arthur auditions to be a go-go boy (his dancing is unbelievable) -- The gratuitous nudity (the director/leading actor just had to get a nude shot in) -- The preacher's office with its cardboard and crayon rendition of Christ -- Of course, the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings (what narrative function does this play?!?) -- The ex-wife's wrestling match with Ben to get possession of her gun -- The detailed sequence wherein Arthur kills the preacher; he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match -- Yes, the gay religious-fanatic brother with his bleached hair and WeHo fashions -- And, my

{"value":"I saw this film when it was first released. The memory of how bad it was has stayed with me almost forty years. I didn't want to trust my own sentiments about the movie when I saw it, so I consulted a movie review published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day- sentiment confirmed, the reviewer wrote that the movie was incoherent, indecipherable, and uninspiring. A little research reveals that the producer was star Leslie Caron's husband, thus the whiff of nepotism suggests the beginning for this awful film. The film's roster of many capable actors - Caron, Warren Oates, Scatman Crothers, Gloria Grahame, and James Sikking among others - suggests that it holds some promise. But the death of this film is attributable to its terrible screenplay. The \"mystery\" implicated is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left perplexed from scene to scene. The movie seems torn between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller, but never settles upon one or the other. The sense of suspense is entirely absent. The main characters settle on playing dry, emotionless types in a fashion that inspires no empathy whatsoever. The cinematography is pedestrian. The result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters, the plot, and, in the end, the film itself. I am little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available to purchase. I hope that if TCM finds a print of this film and feels compelled to air it that it is safely relegated to the 4:00 am slot.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","film","when","it","be","releas","the","memori","of","how","bad","it","be","have","stai","with","me","almost","forti","year","i","do","not","want","to","trust","my","own","sentim","about","the","movi","when","i","see","it","so","i","consult","a","movi","review","publish","in","a","major","metropolitan","newspap","the","next","dai","sentim","confirm","the","review","write","that","the","movi","be","incoher","indecipher","and","uninspir","a","littl","research","reveal","that","the","produc","be","star","lesli","caron","husband","thu","the","whiff","of","nepot","suggest","the","begin","for","thi","aw","film","the","film","roster","of","mani","capabl","actor","caron","warren","oat","scatman","crother","gloria","graham","and","jame","sik","among","other","suggest","that","it","hold","some","promis","but","the","death","of","thi","film","be","attribut","to","it","terribl","screenplai","the","mysteri","implic","be","so","obscur","and","so","littl","reveal","throughout","the","film","that","the","viewer","be","leav","perplex","from","scene","to","scene","the","movi","seem","tear","between","be","a","detect","mysteri","and","a","espionag","thriller","but","never","settl","upon","on","or","the","other","the","sens","of","suspens","be","entir","absent","the","main","charact","settl","on","plai","spindri","emotionless","typ","in","a","fashion","that","inspir","no","empathi","whatsoev","the","cinematographi","be","pedestrian","the","result","be","that","the","hapless","viewer","lose","interest","in","the","charact","the","plot","and","in","the","end","the","film","itself","i","be","littl","surpris","that","there","be","no","version","of","thi","pathet","film","avail","to","purchas","i","hope","that","if","tcm","find","a","print","of","thi","film","and","feel","compel","to","air","it","that","it","be","safe","releg","to","the","be","slot"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","releas","memori","bad","stai","almost","forti","year","want","trust","sentim","movi","see","consult","movi","review","publish","major","metropolitan","newspap","next","dai","sentim","confirm","review","write","movi","incoher","indecipher","uninspir","littl","research","reveal","produc","star","lesli","caron","husband","thu","whiff","nepot","suggest","begin","thi","aw","film","film","roster","mani","capabl","actor","caron","warren","oat","scatman","crother","gloria","graham","jame","sik","among","suggest","hold","promis","death","thi","film","attribut","terribl","screenplai","mysteri","implic","obscur","littl","reveal","throughout","film","viewer","leav","perplex","scene","scene","movi","seem","tear","detect","mysteri","espionag","thriller","never","settl","upon","sens","suspens","entir","absent","main","charact","settl","plai","spindri","emotionless","typ","fashion","inspir","empathi","whatsoev","cinematographi","pedestrian","result","hapless","viewer","lose","interest","charact","plot","end","film","littl","surpris","version","thi","pathet","film","avail","purchas","hope","tcm","find","print","thi","film","feel","compel","air","safe","releg","slot"],"filtered2":["see","releas","memori","bad","stai","almost","forti","year","want","trust","sentim","see","consult","review","publish","major","metropolitan","newspap","next","dai","sentim","confirm","review","write","incoher","indecipher","uninspir","littl","research","reveal","produc","star","lesli","caron","husband","thu","whiff","nepot","suggest","begin","aw","roster","mani","capabl","actor","caron","warren","oat","scatman","crother","gloria","graham","jame","sik","among","suggest","hold","promis","death","attribut","terribl","screenplai","mysteri","implic","obscur","littl","reveal","throughout","viewer","leav","perplex","scene","scene","seem","tear","detect","mysteri","espionag","thriller","never","settl","upon","sens","suspens","entir","absent","main","charact","settl","plai","spindri","emotionless","typ","fashion","inspir","empathi","whatsoev","cinematographi","pedestrian","result","hapless","viewer","lose","interest","charact","plot","end","littl","surpris","version","pathet","avail","purchas","hope","tcm","find","print","feel","compel","air","safe","releg","slot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,9,10,14,19,24,32,35,37,38,40,41,42,43,50,57,60,65,74,100,131,132,138,147,166,173,176,179,181,198,220,221,245,261,279,297,326,327,366,384,403,404,414,438,447,529,536,602,620,629,630,646,679,683,703,714,826,833,909,991,1037,1062,1068,1120,1179,1192,1253,1290,1447,1536,1538,1549,1586,1606,1999,2084,2188,2377,2824,2988,3074,3119,3150,3176,3345,3434,3472,3480,3747,3818,4141,4309,5570,6087,6702,6757,7090,7223,7229,7658,8334],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"I rented this movie, thinking it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece. What I got was a piece of pure garbage. This movie was confusing in most spots, choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spots. Mira Sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was depressing at best. Ben Kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his projects. Fiona Shaw should definitely stick to playing Petunia Dursley; at least the Harry Potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie.<br /><br />The cinematography looks like some college kid took a class in Cinematography 101 and failed miserably. Almost every scene in the movie is chopped up for some sort of effect; the end result of course being the cheesiest bit of editing I've ever seen. Jay Rodan was almost good as Agis; too bad he had such a bad script to work with. Rachael Stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting. In the end, I really wish Blockbuster Video gave refunds. I'm so glad I didn't spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater. If they've been performing this Marivaux play since the 18th century, it makes me wonder how many people over the ages have had their best naps during this work. If I had been there, they wouldn't have hear the play over the snoring. Thank goodness for the modern convenience of DVD players; you can skip past the boring or awful scenes.

{"value":"The first Cruel Intentions, the original, is my favorite movie of all time. It was an absolute masterpiece. So how on earth could they make a sequel so downright bad. Sarah Michelle Gellar was perfect in the first movie. In this one, Amy Adams sucks. She is terrible. And couldn't they have found a chick who actually looked like Sarah Michelle Gellar? At least the same hair color!!! i mean come on. Robin Dunn isn't as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely terrible when compared to Ryan Phillipe. The Sebastian in the first film is devious, deceitful, and much more evil than the Sebastian in the prequel. And what is up with the story line. It basically goes like this...<br /><br />1- Sebastian has a bad rep at his first school, so the movie says, although it mentions nothing about him and his dating life, and how he has been with girls 2- Sebastian moves to New York, and just suddenly decides he's going to turn himself around. He \"falls in love\" with Danielle (might i remind you that in the original, Sarah Michelle giller says quote \"you broke up with THE FIRST PERSON you ever loved because i said to- so how can he have been in love in the prequel???). And he's all nice and charming, and all \"good person\", as he turns down sex from the chick his dad was doing.<br /><br />3- He does a complete 180, and ends up in a threesome at the end of the movie, and then seducing Cherry.<br /><br />I mean, its terrible. And i loved the first one so much. I haven't even seen the third one yet.

{"value":"After too many bad memories, I took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the Season 2 sequence. I recently watched it again just to remind me why. I've always considered this the worst ST:TNG episode (with the exception of \"Shades of Gray,\" which barely counts as an episode at all).<br /><br />I keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author's Writing 101 teacher: \"SHOW, DON'T TELL!\" From Deanna Troi's pronouncement, and everyone else's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming, dangerous rogue Okona is, to Guinan's explanation about how funny her droid joke is (it isn't), to the who-cares resolution to the conflict, there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple-underlined for our edification, and there ain't a believable moment in any of it. Unfortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot. On the other hand, it could be that no one short of John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from \"Doctor Who\") could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role.<br /><br />(Zero points, by the way, to the Data subplot. While I think Joe Piscopo stopped being funny decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had nothing to work with here. Although the Jerry Lewis bit was funny in a stupid way.)<br /><br />On a good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser Original Series episode.

{"value":"Given the people involved, it is hard to see why this movie should be so messed up and dull. The writer, David Ward, wrote the amazing caper film \"The Sting\" two years later, Jane Fonda had just won an Academy Award for Klute, and Donald Sutherland had just done excellent work in films like \"Klute,\" \"Start the Revolution Without Me,\" and \"Kelly's Heroes.\" Plotwise, the movie is a caper tale, with a small gang of bumbling misfits planning a big heist. At the same time the movie wants to be hip satire, a series of comedy sketches of the type that the NBC television show \"Saturday Night\" would do so well two years later. The bad result is that the plot makes the comedy bits seem awkward and forced and the disconnected comedy bits destroy any kind of suspense that the heist might have. It is quite literally a movie that keeps smashing into itself, just as the cars in the cars in the demolition scenes run into each other.<br /><br />The only real interest for me was watching Jane Fonda. Her \"Iris Caine\" is supposed to be a light hearted version of her dramatic Bree Daniels prostitute character in \"Klute\" Yet, one doesn't believe her for a moment. It is always Jane Fonda pretending to be a prostitute that we are watching. It is as terrible a performance as her performance in \"Klute\" was terrific. It would be a good lesson for acting teachers to run the two films together to show how the same actress in the same type of role can be great or pathetic. It suggests that actors are only as good as their writers and directors.","finished_norm":["give","the","peopl","involv","it","be","hard","to","see","why","thi","movi","should","be","so","mess","up","and","dull","the","writer","david","ward","write","the","amaz","caper","film","the","sting","two","year","late","jane","fonda","have","just","win","a","academi","award","for","klute","and","donald","sutherland","have","just","do","excel","work","in","film","like","klute","start","the","revolut","without","me","and","kelli","hero","plotwis","the","movi","be","a","caper","tale","with","a","small","gang","of","bumbl","misfit","plan","a","big","heist","at","the","same","time","the","movi","want","to","be","hip","satir","a","seri","of","comedi","sketch","of","the","typ","that","the","nbc","televis","show","saturdai","night","would","do","so","good","two","year","late","the","bad","result","be","that","the","plot","make","the","comedi","bit","seem","awkward","and","forc","and","the","disconnect","comedi","bit","destroi","ani","kind","of","suspens","that","the","heist","mai","have","it","be","quit","liter","a","movi","that","keep","smash","into","itself","just","a","the","car","in","the","car","in","the","demolit","scene","run","into","each","otherbr","br","the","onli","real","interest","for","me","be","watch","jane","fonda","her","iri","cain","be","suppos","to","be","a","light","heart","version","of","her","dramat","bree","daniel","prostitut","charact","in","klute","yet","on","doe","not","believ","her","for","a","moment","it","be","alwai","jane","fonda","pretend","to","be","a","prostitut","that","we","be","watch","it","be","a","terribl","a","perform","a","her","perform","in","klute","be","terrif","it","would","be","a","good","lesson","for","act","teacher","to","run","the","two","film","togeth","to","show","how","the","same","actress","in","the","same","typ","of","role","can","be","great","or","pathet","it","suggest","that","actor","be","onli","a","good","a","their","writer","and","director"],"filtered":["give","peopl","involv","hard","see","thi","movi","mess","dull","writer","david","ward","write","amaz","caper","film","sting","two","year","late","jane","fonda","win","academi","award","klute","donald","sutherland","excel","work","film","like","klute","start","revolut","without","kelli","hero","plotwis","movi","caper","tale","small","gang","bumbl","misfit","plan","big","heist","time","movi","want","hip","satir","seri","comedi","sketch","typ","nbc","televis","show","saturdai","night","good","two","year","late","bad","result","plot","make","comedi","bit","seem","awkward","forc","disconnect","comedi","bit","destroi","ani","kind","suspens","heist","mai","quit","liter","movi","keep","smash","car","car","demolit","scene","run","otherbr","br","onli","real","interest","watch","jane","fonda","iri","cain","suppos","light","heart","version","dramat","bree","daniel","prostitut","charact","klute","yet","doe","believ","moment","alwai","jane","fonda","pretend","prostitut","watch","terribl","perform","perform","klute","terrif","good","lesson","act","teacher","run","two","film","togeth","show","actress","typ","role","great","pathet","suggest","actor","onli","good","writer","director"],"filtered2":["give","peopl","involv","hard","see","mess","dull","writer","david","ward","write","amaz","caper","sting","two","year","late","jane","fonda","win","academi","award","klute","donald","sutherland","excel","work","like","klute","start","revolut","without","kelli","hero","plotwis","caper","tale","small","gang","bumbl","misfit","plan","big","heist","time","want","hip","satir","comedi","sketch","typ","nbc","televis","show","saturdai","night","good","two","year","late","bad","result","plot","make","comedi","bit","seem","awkward","forc","disconnect","comedi","bit","destroi","ani","kind","suspens","heist","mai","quit","liter","keep","smash","car","car","demolit","scene","run","otherbr","onli","real","interest","watch","jane","fonda","iri","cain","suppos","light","heart","version","dramat","bree","daniel","prostitut","charact","klute","yet","doe","believ","moment","alwai","jane","fonda","pretend","prostitut","watch","terribl","perform","perform","klute","terrif","good","lesson","act","teacher","run","two","togeth","show","actress","typ","role","great","pathet","suggest","actor","onli","good","writer","director"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,9,10,11,18,19,21,23,27,28,30,32,35,37,41,46,47,48,51,57,58,60,65,71,80,82,91,105,120,122,125,127,128,134,137,149,150,166,171,188,194,197,210,220,241,270,284,287,338,353,355,363,367,375,384,407,447,489,529,580,581,602,614,646,663,675,685,738,756,820,897,997,1004,1067,1114,1272,1278,1371,1382,1516,1796,1873,1880,1907,2155,2225,2227,2359,2472,2516,2621,2780,2928,3242,3838,4008,4536,4542,5086,5236,5289,5589,6257,6809],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"I should put out an alert all over saying that the movie shouldn't be watched. It fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. The special effect were horrible, I hadn't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology. How can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1/10th the speed? How can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? How can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away? How come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself?<br /><br />Not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me, it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder. There were the standard dialogues like Ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and Pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to Hindustaan me hai and LOC cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai. Stupid to say the least.<br /><br />What Shobha De had written is true. The director worked without a script and it shows. There is no flow to the movie. There is no gradual progression from one battle to another. It is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war. The explanatory scenes are awful. The chief of army staff looks unconvincing. To make matters worse the theatre people had indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3

{"value":"OK me and a friend rented this a few days ago because we like to keep track of b-movies since we do them ourselves. Anyway, the cover contained blood and weird looking naked girls with fangs and stuff... and Tom Savini! There is just no way this movie can fail! Right? wrong!! It just seems like such a waste! There was really no story, the dialog was terrible (is anyone there? x 1000!!!), the characters were.. well, they really lacked any kind of personality... The effects were terrible.. and whats up with these long artsy shots of scared people running around doing nothing.. with extreme closeups of eyes and stuff? We were sitting the whole movie waiting for something... anything to happen... but no... \"oh, here comes the nymphs! great! oh.. they're kissing... again... and now for the violence! OK... nothing really happens... again... oh, now they run around... and the closeups of eyes... again... oh, heres Tom Savini! Oh... he died... right... OK, maybe now something cool or even interesting will happen.. no.. oh! Cool! a severed head! the end... oh crap..\" And finally, since i'm so full of myself.. i'll tell you this! Give me a van, six actors, a weird looking house, Tom Savini, a couple of naked girls with fangs and buckets of blood and i could make the coolest movie you've ever seen... I've made movies with zero budget in two days that has better effects, better acting and a better script than this... what is this Johannes guy doing??

{"value":"The often-reliable Leonard Maltin says this is a \"delightful romance\" and that Sanders is \"superb.\" Maltin must have confused this movie with something else. Sanders is snide and droll and superb, as usual,  you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery, \"Sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three,\" but dull, wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately. The storyline itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a suave jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels, is entertaining enough, but it has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as *Marie Antoinette*, and certainly the deplorable *Forever Amber* (which screams for a classy remake). Though, in his defense, Sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character, it is all for naught. I am an unabashed Douglas Sirk fan, but this is 1946, and it is one of Sirk's earliest American efforts, lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid, breast-heaving potboilers. Sirk is just getting his feet wet here, and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with *Magnificent Obsession*, and hit his stride, bombarding us with such estrogen-fests as *All That Heaven Allows*, *Written on the Wind*, and *Imitation of Life*. But *Scandal In Paris* is hardly his best work  a relatively low-budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming.","finished_norm":["the","oftenreli","leonard","maltin","sai","thi","be","a","delight","romanc","and","that","sander","be","superb","maltin","must","have","confus","thi","movi","with","someth","els","sander","be","snide","and","droll","and","superb","a","usual","you","can","imagin","hi","deliveri","of","the","line","regard","adulteri","sometim","the","chain","of","matrimoni","be","so","heavi","thei","have","to","be","carri","by","three","but","dull","wooden","and","date","describ","thi","movi","much","accur","the","storylin","itself","a","autobiographi","with","sander","a","a","suav","jewel","thief","francoi","eugen","vidocq","who","becom","chief","of","polic","but","can","hardli","resist","the","lure","of","fine","jewel","be","entertain","enough","but","it","have","the","same","kind","of","hollow","histor","hollywood","treatment","that","mar","such","period","epic","a","mari","antoinett","and","certainli","the","deplor","forev","amber","which","scream","for","a","classi","remak","though","in","hi","defens","sander","try","mightili","to","add","some","depth","to","hi","charact","it","be","all","for","naught","i","be","a","unabash","dougla","sirk","fan","but","thi","be","and","it","be","on","of","sirk","earli","american","effort","lack","mani","of","the","signatur","touch","that","would","defin","hi","florid","breastheav","potboil","sirk","be","just","get","hi","foot","wet","here","and","make","a","numb","of","unmemor","film","over","the","next","ten","year","until","he","strike","gold","with","magnific","obsess","and","hit","hi","stride","bombard","u","with","such","estrogenfest","a","all","that","heaven","allow","write","on","the","wind","and","imit","of","life","but","scandal","in","pari","be","hardli","hi","well","work","a","rel","lowbudget","affair","with","cheesi","set","and","ineffect","costum"],"filtered":["oftenreli","leonard","maltin","sai","thi","delight","romanc","sander","superb","maltin","must","confus","thi","movi","someth","els","sander","snide","droll","superb","usual","imagin","hi","deliveri","line","regard","adulteri","sometim","chain","matrimoni","heavi","thei","carri","three","dull","wooden","date","describ","thi","movi","much","accur","storylin","autobiographi","sander","suav","jewel","thief","francoi","eugen","vidocq","becom","chief","polic","hardli","resist","lure","fine","jewel","entertain","enough","kind","hollow","histor","hollywood","treatment","mar","period","epic","mari","antoinett","certainli","deplor","forev","amber","scream","classi","remak","though","hi","defens","sander","try","mightili","add","depth","hi","charact","naught","unabash","dougla","sirk","fan","thi","sirk","earli","american","effort","lack","mani","signatur","touch","defin","hi","florid","breastheav","potboil","sirk","get","hi","foot","wet","make","numb","unmemor","film","next","ten","year","strike","gold","magnific","obsess","hit","hi","stride","bombard","u","estrogenfest","heaven","allow","write","wind","imit","life","scandal","pari","hardli","hi","well","work","rel","lowbudget","affair","cheesi","set","ineffect","costum"],"filtered2":["oftenreli","leonard","maltin","delight","romanc","sander","superb","maltin","must","confus","someth","els","sander","snide","droll","superb","usual","imagin","deliveri","line","regard","adulteri","sometim","chain","matrimoni","heavi","carri","three","dull","wooden","date","describ","accur","storylin","autobiographi","sander","suav","jewel","thief","francoi","eugen","vidocq","becom","chief","polic","hardli","resist","lure","fine","jewel","entertain","enough","kind","hollow","histor","hollywood","treatment","mar","period","epic","mari","antoinett","certainli","deplor","forev","amber","scream","classi","remak","though","defens","sander","try","mightili","add","depth","charact","naught","unabash","dougla","sirk","fan","sirk","earli","american","effort","lack","mani","signatur","touch","defin","florid","breastheav","potboil","sirk","get","foot","wet","make","numb","unmemor","next","ten","year","strike","gold","magnific","obsess","hit","stride","bombard","u","estrogenfest","heaven","allow","write","wind","imit","life","scandal","pari","hardli","well","work","rel","lowbudget","affair","cheesi","set","ineffect","costum"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,10,20,36,48,50,53,57,65,75,86,93,107,109,112,115,122,140,141,183,195,196,223,224,265,266,297,299,300,340,367,388,389,401,427,464,471,483,500,515,516,521,526,543,545,621,647,665,668,743,745,776,891,892,914,921,953,981,1009,1019,1056,1122,1165,1177,1201,1222,1324,1543,1567,1601,1684,1800,1818,1886,1904,1968,2092,2113,2162,2174,2301,2316,2373,2405,2545,2919,3015,3139,3275,3649,5067,5155,5252,5415,5421,5936,5950,6384,6641,6859,7077,7220,7257,7709,8106],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"An actress making a movie in Africa is kidnapped and taken into the jungle where she is held for ransom. The producer hires some one to go and bring her back. Complicating everything are the cannibals in the jungle who worship a really ugly looking \"god\" who likes to eat naked women.<br /><br />This is a gory sleazy movie. There is copious amounts of nudity and violence, not to mention violence against nude people. Its an exploitation film designed to appeal to the deepest darkest parts of our being, and if the movie wasn't so boring this film would be a classic. Lets face it, despite the gore, the nasty sex and abuse,and the ugly monster this movie is a snoozer. The pacing is all off kilter and it puts you out. There are multiple plot lines that all seem to be happening separately from each other, even though its ultimately all one story. Worst of all, almost no one says anything. Most of the minimal dialog concerns the cruelty or one characters protestations that \"I'll do what I want\". Its such a quiet and dull movie that if it weren't for the frequent screams of the victims I'd recommend this as a sleep aide.<br /><br />This is a movie to avoid unless you need sleep, or unless you need to see every Euro-cannibal movie.<br /><br />(An aside. VideoAsia just released this as part of their Terror Tales series. Their print is oddly letter-boxed which looks to be the result of taking their print from a Japanese source (there is fogging) that was cropped to remove the subtitles.

{"value":"Don't listen to the misleading title \"Werewolf Woman\". The Europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films, but this one here is just a bit too much. \"Werewolf Woman\" seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. Fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly. Shes not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. The film can't even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural horror (I thought I was in for a trash classic after these) to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. At the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. Yeah, all right.<br /><br />To be fair, there are a few entertaining aspects of the production. The title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes. However, these become rather monotonous quickly. Also, the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion, especially the worlds most swinging doctor (he drinks on the job). Unfortunately, the film becomes pretty irritating fast. There's no actual plot or anything else really. Its a shame, because reading a description I felt the film had some real potential. \"Werewolf Woman\" is far overlong, slow moving, and a bit too pointless, even by the standards of the exploitation genre.

{"value":"**** WARNING: here be spoilers **** Why do I waste my hastily fleeing years watching garbage like this? This film is an impressive collection of clichés, poor writing, worse directing, and then we haven't even got to the acting yet. <br /><br />And of course, you can predict the whole story from beginning to end.<br /><br />Hero expert fights against stupid, corrupt and incompetent henchmen. One avalanche goes off, burying all the heroes who somehow manage to get out alive in spite of going through all sorts of cliffhanger perils. Corrupt partner who caused the whole thing gets fried alive together with his payoff money. Second avalanche heroically deflected by renegade expert's adventurous experiment. Evil henchmen in the end turn out to have a heart as well. Troubled teenager falls into the arms of her crusty stepmother after being saved by her. Etc, etc, etc, etc, on and on it goes. <br /><br />In fact, there's little reason to warn for spoilers. You could probably work the whole plot out if I gave you the basic ingredients. At least, I wasn't too wide off the mark most of the time, anticipating what would happen next.<br /><br />And then we haven't discussed the factual errors.<br /><br />I agree with a previous commentator that even though there are usually SOME redeeming features even of a bad movie. you'd be hard pressed to find any in this one. I suppose I gave it 2 out of 10 for some nice scenery shots, but that's it.<br /><br />It's been some time since a film made me groan, but this one certainly did.","finished_norm":["warn","here","be","spoiler","why","do","i","wast","my","hastili","flee","year","watch","garbag","like","thi","thi","film","be","a","impress","collect","of","cliché","poor","write","wrong","direct","and","then","we","have","not","even","get","to","the","act","yet","br","br","and","of","cours","you","can","predict","the","whole","stori","from","begin","to","endbr","br","hero","expert","fight","against","stupid","corrupt","and","incompet","henchman","on","avalanch","go","off","buri","all","the","hero","who","somehow","manag","to","get","out","aliv","in","spite","of","go","through","all","sort","of","cliffhang","peril","corrupt","partner","who","caus","the","whole","thing","get","fry","aliv","togeth","with","hi","payoff","monei","avalanch","heroic","deflect","by","renegad","expert","adventur","experi","evil","henchman","in","the","end","turn","out","to","have","a","heart","a","good","troubl","teenag","fall","into","the","arm","of","her","crusti","stepmoth","after","be","save","by","her","etc","etc","etc","etc","on","and","on","it","go","br","br","in","fact","there","littl","reason","to","warn","for","spoiler","you","can","probabl","work","the","whole","plot","out","if","i","give","you","the","basic","ingredi","at","littl","i","be","not","too","wide","off","the","mark","much","of","the","time","anticip","what","would","happen","nextbr","br","and","then","we","have","not","discuss","the","factual","errorsbr","br","i","agre","with","a","previou","comment","that","even","though","there","be","usual","some","redeem","featur","even","of","a","bad","movi","you","have","be","hard","press","to","find","ani","in","thi","on","i","suppos","i","give","it","out","of","for","some","nice","sceneri","shot","but","that","itbr","br","it","be","some","time","sinc","a","film","make","me","groan","but","thi","on","certainli","do"],"filtered":["warn","spoiler","wast","hastili","flee","year","watch","garbag","like","thi","thi","film","impress","collect","cliché","poor","write","wrong","direct","even","get","act","yet","br","br","cours","predict","whole","stori","begin","endbr","br","hero","expert","fight","stupid","corrupt","incompet","henchman","avalanch","go","buri","hero","somehow","manag","get","aliv","spite","go","sort","cliffhang","peril","corrupt","partner","caus","whole","thing","get","fry","aliv","togeth","hi","payoff","monei","avalanch","heroic","deflect","renegad","expert","adventur","experi","evil","henchman","end","turn","heart","good","troubl","teenag","fall","arm","crusti","stepmoth","save","etc","etc","etc","etc","go","br","br","fact","littl","reason","warn","spoiler","probabl","work","whole","plot","give","basic","ingredi","littl","wide","mark","much","time","anticip","happen","nextbr","br","discuss","factual","errorsbr","br","agre","previou","comment","even","though","usual","redeem","featur","even","bad","movi","hard","press","find","ani","thi","suppos","give","nice","sceneri","shot","itbr","br","time","sinc","film","make","groan","thi","certainli"],"filtered2":["warn","spoiler","wast","hastili","flee","year","watch","garbag","like","impress","collect","cliché","poor","write","wrong","direct","even","get","act","yet","cours","predict","whole","stori","begin","endbr","hero","expert","fight","stupid","corrupt","incompet","henchman","avalanch","go","buri","hero","somehow","manag","get","aliv","spite","go","sort","cliffhang","peril","corrupt","partner","caus","whole","thing","get","fry","aliv","togeth","payoff","monei","avalanch","heroic","deflect","renegad","expert","adventur","experi","evil","henchman","end","turn","heart","good","troubl","teenag","fall","arm","crusti","stepmoth","save","etc","etc","etc","etc","go","fact","littl","reason","warn","spoiler","probabl","work","whole","plot","give","basic","ingredi","littl","wide","mark","time","anticip","happen","nextbr","discuss","factual","errorsbr","agre","previou","comment","even","though","usual","redeem","featur","even","bad","hard","press","find","ani","suppos","give","nice","sceneri","shot","itbr","time","sinc","make","groan","certainli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,14,17,21,24,25,27,29,30,32,38,48,57,65,86,89,94,95,96,97,102,111,126,136,146,147,148,149,162,169,171,189,194,199,233,262,265,269,270,280,286,305,321,333,337,345,375,389,418,429,430,441,452,490,523,527,549,614,622,634,693,702,717,752,784,992,1026,1048,1076,1138,1326,1514,1582,1767,1783,1900,1940,1964,2104,2242,2270,3138,3199,3328,3373,3443,3602,3681,3850,5041,5320,7300,8037],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

{"value":"That's a snippet of choice dialogue delivered by the evil, ballbusting lady assistant of a famous scientist to her prim maid just before she lures three incredibly dumb college girls to a mansion for behavior modification experiments. Meanwhile, at the local bar, people drink and dance to lame 80s rock songs. A biker punk has sex with a cycle slut on a pinball table in front of a crowd of people, then tries to rape the scientist's virginal daughter Jessica (Debra Hunter), who is in love with another biker (Dale Midkiff, from PET SEMATARY), who, in turn, is in cohorts with the assistant! Back at the house, the sorority bimbos swim, shower, change clothes and have sex with men from the bar. A small silver ball (part of the experiment) flies into victims mouths and turns them into drooling, killer zombies!<br /><br />If that isn't enough to entertain you, there's a hilarious theme song (\"Nightmare Fantasy\"), roller skating, some serious daisy dukes and a psychic hand puppet (!?) that warns \"DANGER! DANGER!\" just like the LOST IN SPACE robot and recommends hitchhiking as one of the best ways to pick up men!<br /><br />This filmed-in-Florida mess is so mind-numbingly awful that multiple viewings are recommended to soak it all in. And, hey isn't that NYPD Blue's Detective Jill Kirkendall turned CNN newscaster Andrea Thompson as one of oft-nude bimbos? Sure is! Supposedly this was started in 1982 and new footage was added later for the video release in 1985.<br /><br />Score: 1 out of 10 (and I mean that in a good

{"value":"If this could be rated a 0, it would be. From the atrocious wooden acting to the dull, plodding pace, the puerile exploitation angle and the sophomoric pseudolesbian titillation added purely for the sake of the sad viewers, this is a disaster of a film.<br /><br />The plot is predictable, as from the beginning one is absolutely certain of what will happen to all of the characters and how the plot will commence. From a boring, unexceptional beginning to a pathetic and bleak ending, every single presence in this film is wasted, and every meagre scrap of talent dug up for this turkey is squandered.<br /><br />If you want to watch something as relentlessly bleak with plenty of the same childish titillation, watch one of the Ilsa films. At least they're unapologetic and up-front about what they're trying to do. How something this horrendously bad ever managed to be rated above a 5 is a miracle of how people with no taste or discerning standards can sometimes come together for the most dubious of purposes.<br /><br />It's not scary, it's not interesting, and above all it's not arousing in any sense of the word. It is, in my opinion, a crime; it is a crime that such a horribly offensive and incompetent piece of trash was ever conceived of and given the resources to come into existence, and even more a tragedy that it is still defended by some woefully misguided viewers.<br /><br />Not even Elvira's cheerful personality and joking ways could soften the blow that this horrifying travesty of film is. Avoid it at all costs.","finished_norm":["if","thi","can","be","rate","a","it","would","be","from","the","atroci","wooden","act","to","the","dull","plod","pace","the","pueril","exploit","angl","and","the","sophomor","pseudolesbian","titil","add","pure","for","the","sake","of","the","sad","viewer","thi","be","a","disast","of","a","filmbr","br","the","plot","be","predict","a","from","the","begin","on","be","absolut","certain","of","what","will","happen","to","all","of","the","charact","and","how","the","plot","will","commenc","from","a","bore","unexcept","begin","to","a","pathet","and","bleak","end","everi","singl","presenc","in","thi","film","be","wast","and","everi","meagr","scrap","of","talent","dig","up","for","thi","turkei","be","squanderedbr","br","if","you","want","to","watch","someth","a","relentlessli","bleak","with","plenti","of","the","same","childish","titil","watch","on","of","the","ilsa","film","at","littl","thei","re","unapologet","and","upfront","about","what","thei","re","try","to","do","how","someth","thi","horrend","bad","ever","manag","to","be","rate","abov","a","be","a","miracl","of","how","peopl","with","no","tast","or","discern","standard","can","sometim","come","togeth","for","the","much","dubiou","of","purposesbr","br","it","not","scari","it","not","interest","and","abov","all","it","not","arous","in","ani","sens","of","the","word","it","be","in","my","opinion","a","crime","it","be","a","crime","that","such","a","horribli","offens","and","incompet","piec","of","trash","be","ever","conceiv","of","and","give","the","resourc","to","come","into","exist","and","even","much","a","tragedi","that","it","be","still","defend","by","some","woefulli","misguid","viewersbr","br","not","even","elvira","cheer","person","and","joke","wai","can","soften","the","blow","that","thi","horrifi","travesti","of","film","be","avoid","it","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["thi","rate","atroci","wooden","act","dull","plod","pace","pueril","exploit","angl","sophomor","pseudolesbian","titil","add","pure","sake","sad","viewer","thi","disast","filmbr","br","plot","predict","begin","absolut","certain","happen","charact","plot","commenc","bore","unexcept","begin","pathet","bleak","end","everi","singl","presenc","thi","film","wast","everi","meagr","scrap","talent","dig","thi","turkei","squanderedbr","br","want","watch","someth","relentlessli","bleak","plenti","childish","titil","watch","ilsa","film","littl","thei","re","unapologet","upfront","thei","re","try","someth","thi","horrend","bad","ever","manag","rate","abov","miracl","peopl","tast","discern","standard","sometim","come","togeth","much","dubiou","purposesbr","br","scari","interest","abov","arous","ani","sens","word","opinion","crime","crime","horribli","offens","incompet","piec","trash","ever","conceiv","give","resourc","come","exist","even","much","tragedi","still","defend","woefulli","misguid","viewersbr","br","even","elvira","cheer","person","joke","wai","soften","blow","thi","horrifi","travesti","film","avoid","cost"],"filtered2":["rate","atroci","wooden","act","dull","plod","pace","pueril","exploit","angl","sophomor","pseudolesbian","titil","add","pure","sake","sad","viewer","disast","filmbr","plot","predict","begin","absolut","certain","happen","charact","plot","commenc","bore","unexcept","begin","pathet","bleak","end","everi","singl","presenc","wast","everi","meagr","scrap","talent","dig","turkei","squanderedbr","want","watch","someth","relentlessli","bleak","plenti","childish","titil","watch","ilsa","littl","re","unapologet","upfront","re","try","someth","horrend","bad","ever","manag","rate","abov","miracl","peopl","tast","discern","standard","sometim","come","togeth","dubiou","purposesbr","scari","interest","abov","arous","ani","sens","word","opinion","crime","crime","horribli","offens","incompet","piec","trash","ever","conceiv","give","resourc","come","exist","even","tragedi","still","defend","woefulli","misguid","viewersbr","even","elvira","cheer","person","joke","wai","soften","blow","horrifi","travesti","avoid","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,9,10,14,21,23,24,27,30,32,33,34,36,37,44,53,60,64,68,85,89,94,108,147,153,173,202,214,218,222,258,270,276,279,299,335,337,345,367,396,443,455,500,528,538,546,566,602,616,671,704,726,753,754,774,836,872,888,891,918,1034,1145,1159,1219,1270,1276,1293,1520,1681,1799,1875,1900,2160,2183,2233,2440,2562,2572,2826,3044,3164,3175,3741,3878,4146,4464,4689,4707,4737,4833,5290,6255,6705,8319],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,9,10,14,21,23,24,27,30,32,33,34,36,37,44,53,60,64,68,85,89,94,108,147,153,173,202,214,218,

{"value":"I have to say that there is nothing wrong with low budget films, so that was not my problem with it. My problem with it is that I felt like I was watching my next door neighbor's home movie. IMO everything about it just seemed like a guy wrote out a quick story, grabbed a camera, and started shooting. I understand how hard this must be to do effectively, but when I pay to rent a film, I expect to feel like I am watching some type of professionally made movie.<br /><br />John Schneider has a huge resume, is a great actor, and was fine in this film. The other people in it were not. I understand how it must be fun, and cheaper to use friends, and relatives as the cast, but it doesn't make for convincing acting. It seemed like the way it was shot, he was trying to give many of the scenes a more interesting look, but when the writing, plot, and acting are there to begin with, that type of style isn't necessary, and it is a distraction.<br /><br />Also on a technical level, it had digital artifacts all over the place. In the first scene of all of those fine cars, when they did a slow scan of them, they appeared to jerk back and forth just a little bit. The problem isn't in my viewing equipment, (Benq PE-8700 84\" diagonal) but somewhere in the production. I've never seen that kind of artifact in a professionally made film before. Then there was the sound. It sounded like they didn't do any voice-overs, which may be o.k. unless it sounded like the track in this film. It sounded like the built in microphone on the

{"value":"Growing up, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, but even I was left cold by this film. For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a straightforward \"Behind the Music\" style documentary. Rather it is a biographical art film, chock full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and mostly pointless animation sketches lifted from \"Animal Farm.\" The movie is coherent but overlong by about a half hour.<br /><br />The campfire format, while touching in thought, is actually pretty annoying in execution. First off, without titles, its hard to even know who half of these interviewees are. Secondly, who really needs to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack mouth butt licking hosannas about the man? They were not relevant to Strummer's life and their opinions add nothing to his story.<br /><br />This picture is at it's best when Strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, touches on facets of his life most people did not know about: the suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. To me, these were most moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face.<br /><br />There have been better, more straightforward documentaries about Strummer and The Clash.

{"value":"This movie had me going. The title was perhaps the greatest idea that I heard. I thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the US and a group of lone survivors, band together, and plan to take out the zombies. DEAD WRONG! It's about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what's coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge. As you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved. Where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation.<br /><br />First off, the zombie women look like Victoria Secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face. What are zombies but mindless, debatable intelligent, cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs? These zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models, they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies. Sure the eating and killing is there, but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement? Although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, it makes fun of that genre and asks the question, \"why can't zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines?\" I would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies. I would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much, it's an insult and as for scarynot even.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","have","me","go","the","titl","be","perhap","the","great","idea","that","i","hear","i","think","it","be","a","independ","movi","about","a","zombi","outbreak","and","their","quest","to","take","over","the","u","and","a","group","of","lone","survivor","band","togeth","and","plan","to","take","out","the","zombi","dead","wrong","it","about","a","psycho","cop","with","a","weak","for","kill","hi","femal","arrest","get","what","come","to","him","when","a","pack","of","zombi","woman","rise","from","their","grave","in","order","to","get","proper","reveng","a","you","can","see","there","be","noth","about","the","nation","nor","a","counti","involv","where","to","begin","with","the","sever","thi","cinemat","disast","caus","our","nationbr","br","off","the","zombi","woman","look","like","victoria","secret","model","with","dark","eyelin","and","a","pale","face","what","be","zombi","but","mindless","debat","intellig","cannibalist","kill","machin","that","eat","a","a","result","of","their","primit","much","basic","ne","thi","zombi","woman","walk","like","streetwalk","and","runwai","model","thei","talk","a","if","thei","be","in","a","poor","film","noir","movi","and","not","do","thei","act","like","real","zombi","sure","the","eat","and","kill","be","there","but","where","be","the","mindless","and","the","horribl","disfigur","although","it","be","a","veri","interest","concept","and","perhap","a","great","satir","on","the","zombi","genr","it","make","fun","of","that","genr","and","ask","the","question","why","ca","not","zombi","be","beauti","vixen","kill","machin","i","would","sai","that","thi","movi","would","be","consid","a","realli","bad","indi","movi","that","be","produc","and","make","by","garag","junki","i","would","not","recommend","thi","movi","to","anybodi","that","love","zombi","genr","too","much","it","a","insult","and","a","for","scarynot","even"],"filtered":["thi","movi","go","titl","perhap","great","idea","hear","think","independ","movi","zombi","outbreak","quest","take","u","group","lone","survivor","band","togeth","plan","take","zombi","dead","wrong","psycho","cop","weak","kill","hi","femal","arrest","get","come","pack","zombi","woman","rise","grave","order","get","proper","reveng","see","noth","nation","counti","involv","begin","sever","thi","cinemat","disast","caus","nationbr","br","zombi","woman","look","like","victoria","secret","model","dark","eyelin","pale","face","zombi","mindless","debat","intellig","cannibalist","kill","machin","eat","result","primit","much","basic","ne","thi","zombi","woman","walk","like","streetwalk","runwai","model","thei","talk","thei","poor","film","noir","movi","thei","act","like","real","zombi","sure","eat","kill","mindless","horribl","disfigur","although","veri","interest","concept","perhap","great","satir","zombi","genr","make","fun","genr","ask","question","ca","zombi","beauti","vixen","kill","machin","sai","thi","movi","consid","realli","bad","indi","movi","produc","make","garag","junki","recommend","thi","movi","anybodi","love","zombi","genr","much","insult","scarynot","even"],"filtered2":["go","titl","perhap","great","idea","hear","think","independ","zombi","outbreak","quest","take","u","group","lone","survivor","band","togeth","plan","take","zombi","dead","wrong","psycho","cop","weak","kill","femal","arrest","get","come","pack","zombi","woman","rise","grave","order","get","proper","reveng","see","noth","nation","counti","involv","begin","sever","cinemat","disast","caus","nationbr","zombi","woman","look","like","victoria","secret","model","dark","eyelin","pale","face","zombi","mindless","debat","intellig","cannibalist","kill","machin","eat","result","primit","basic","ne","zombi","woman","walk","like","streetwalk","runwai","model","talk","poor","noir","act","like","real","zombi","sure","eat","kill","mindless","horribl","disfigur","although","veri","interest","concept","perhap","great","satir","zombi","genr","make","fun","genr","ask","question","ca","zombi","beauti","vixen","kill","machin","consid","realli","bad","indi","produc","make","garag","junki","recommend","anybodi","love","zombi","genr","insult","scarynot","even"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,9,12,13,15,16,21,25,31,34,49,51,54,60,70,76,80,81,110,112,119,123,146,147,186,216,228,230,237,241,251,259,261,264,268,270,286,294,298,306,316,317,318,325,368,378,379,410,422,439,447,452,467,476,581,599,603,709,725,798,871,922,927,1034,1055,1071,1093,1105,1209,1211,1278,1445,1507,1618,1691,1725,1819,1960,1995,2074,2511,2539,2656,3632,4126,4862,5226,6059,6336,6687,7359,7529,7706],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"This movie was crap with a capital \"C.\" The opening scene showed promise. But that \"promise\" was broken shortly after the viewer learns where the plot is going.<br /><br />And the wooden statue, Morty, who was rather creepy in the original film, looks plain goofy in this one. It was so obviously just a guy in a cheap plastic costume. (And by the way, who else thinks \"Morty\" is one of the most un-scary names on planet earth? It ranks right up there with \"Jimmy\" or \"Fred\" when it comes to horror value. Or why not just name the wooden statute Henry-freakin'-Kissinger. \"Run, it's Dr. Kissinger!\" That'd be about as scary as \"Morty.)<br /><br />And then there's a scene where the \"hero\" hits his father's tombstone with---\"a sledgehammer?\" you might guess--\"a two-by-four?\" someone might venture. No, he angrily beats his father's tombstone with a twig---a freakin' twig. But worse than that, once the characters walk away, the tombstone actually, and inexplicably, bleeds. Oh brother!<br /><br />There's also a Native American guy who lives with the main character's grandparents, but apparently, does nothing except Morty-maintenance. He perpetuates creepy Morty-legends, warns those who scoff, and even fixes Morty's arm when it becomes damaged during a childish prank. But for all his respect for and tenderness toward Morty, does Morty give a rat's hairy behind? No.<br /><br />The movie drags on, and eventually several people die in ways that correspond to their worst fears (sort of). This film is a real yawner.

{"value":"What a load of rubbish.. I can't even begin to describe how awful this film was. The rating it has here is really hard to believe.<br /><br />Avoid... Particularly if you enjoyed the first ginger snaps. The first one was well written, well directed, well executed.. a brilliant film with a fantastic aesthetic and atmosphere. The second one was 'alrite'- decent as a self-standing film, but clearly not up to the level of the first... The third is an insult to the series, period. I rate the films: 10, 6, 1. It's that bad.<br /><br />Oh, and yes it really is set in the past, the sisters are still called Ginger and B Fitzgerald... all muddled in with some half-assed native American mythology. The sisters don't have any real story, or progression, or even a clear relationship... They're just trying to survive and be 'together forever'. That's about as deep as it gets.<br /><br />Staggered that the girls agreed to be in this pile-of-shite, after reading the script.<br /><br />Oh and another thing, staging of action was terrible- people appearing from nowhere regularly, like the girls turn around and there's an elaborate candle-lit setup with a mystic native American woman just sitting there, about to go into a speech. Sets were terrible, couldn't get away from the fact that it was all obviously based in a set, which really didn't help. Also, there was consistently snow outside the camp, but not a trace inside (..on the set).<br /><br />Arrghh,,, so bad! I really was hoping it would be at least as good as the second
