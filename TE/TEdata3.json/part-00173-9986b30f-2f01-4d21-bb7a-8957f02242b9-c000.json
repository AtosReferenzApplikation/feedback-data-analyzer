{"value":"First off I'd like to say that if I had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10, then I'd give it a -4. It's not that I'm a tough critic, it's just that this movie is THAT bad. Everything from the story, to the directing, to the editing is awful. The story is not even halfway decent to begin with (you can't expect much since it is based on a video game, something I was not aware of going into the movie) but the directing and editing made it even worse. The movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones; some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, don't even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don't show any feelings toward each other. You could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'd still be disappointed. Honestly, if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money, and if you don't pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life. So do yourself a favor and don't watch it.","finished_norm":["off","i","have","like","to","sai","that","if","i","have","to","honestli","rate","thi","movi","from","a","to","a","then","i","have","give","it","a","it","not","that","i","be","a","tough","critic","it","just","that","thi","movi","be","that","bad","everyth","from","the","stori","to","the","direct","to","the","edit","be","aw","the","stori","be","not","even","halfwai","decent","to","begin","with","you","ca","not","expect","much","sinc","it","be","base","on","a","video","game","someth","i","be","not","awar","of","go","into","the","movi","but","the","direct","and","edit","make","it","even","wrong","the","movi","cut","at","awkward","point","and","go","to","scene","that","be","complet","unrel","to","the","previou","on","some","like","a","quick","sex","scene","in","the","middl","do","not","even","make","sens","be","put","into","the","stori","see","a","how","the","charact","do","not","show","ani","feel","toward","each","other","you","can","go","into","thi","movi","expect","to","see","a","pile","of","crap","on","the","screen","for","a","hour","and","a","half","and","you","have","still","be","disappoint","honestli","if","you","pai","to","watch","thi","movi","then","you","be","wast","your","monei","and","if","you","do","not","pai","anyth","then","you","be","still","wast","a","hour","and","a","half","of","your","life","so","do","yourself","a","favor","and","do","not","watch","it"],"filtered":["like","sai","honestli","rate","thi","movi","give","tough","critic","thi","movi","bad","everyth","stori","direct","edit","aw","stori","even","halfwai","decent","begin","ca","expect","much","sinc","base","video","game","someth","awar","go","movi","direct","edit","make","even","wrong","movi","cut","awkward","point","go","scene","complet","unrel","previou","like","quick","sex","scene","middl","even","make","sens","put","stori","see","charact","show","ani","feel","toward","go","thi","movi","expect","see","pile","crap","screen","hour","half","still","disappoint","honestli","pai","watch","thi","movi","wast","monei","pai","anyth","still","wast","hour","half","life","favor","watch"],"filtered2":["like","honestli","rate","give","tough","critic","bad","everyth","stori","direct","edit","aw","stori","even","halfwai","decent","begin","ca","expect","sinc","base","video","game","someth","awar","go","direct","edit","make","even","wrong","cut","awkward","point","go","scene","complet","unrel","previou","like","quick","sex","scene","middl","even","make","sens","put","stori","see","charact","show","ani","feel","toward","go","expect","see","pile","crap","screen","hour","half","still","disappoint","honestli","pai","watch","wast","monei","pai","anyth","still","wast","hour","half","life","favor","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,7,9,10,17,19,25,27,28,30,43,53,64,66,75,81,89,102,103,104,126,130,138,147,159,162,173,174,187,192,193,202,206,240,254,303,309,313,322,334,348,374,554,563,579,757,784,1108,1115,1131,1173,1396,1516,1625,3540],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,7,9,10,17,19,25,27,28,30,43,53,64,66,75,81,89,102,103,104,126,130,138,147,159,162,173,174,187,192,193,202,206,240,254,303,309,313,322,334,348,374,554,563,579,757,784,1108,1115,1131,1173,1396,1516,1625,3540],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,2.7780513171783934,2.912480743411154,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,3.83116108203179,2.62476135602347,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.6608112036218214,1.7003182735607676,3.766857155204268,1.929723173391612,1.9742250248702675,1.949757232424728,3.9880092219144876,4.175107420354542,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.2391270689902285,4.528427806839927,2.2907365189289424,2.2844323215331563,2.300267965194495,2.3586007221245198,2.4368824319140248,4.912565156919632,2.4732161909892554,2.5318267134339894,2.517840471459249,2.597304642813496,5.194609285626992,2.7666071276613566,2.889652074525771,2.868298950055202,2.848772527704847,2.907069060519773,5.770689634656382,2.942840385588056,6.020633913114087,3.4572130107926293,3.439602492783994,3.459754308221302,3.5642670069567886,7.433072437368683,3.7636829971100436,4.263079925052412,4.1554492608600455,4.197121957260614,4.2574141875167335,4.409683399244287,4.535724120139652,4.671389985292807,5.695894301807195]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.833875823957243E-5,6.787793401646552E-5,6.840562022849757E-5,6.801037182606783E-5,6.801148609943907E-5,6.791641963316389E-5,6.811841258112394E-5,6.788770799543619E-5,6.804034431101475E-5,7.548704783702067E-5,0.9945916202359644,6.777812226714523E-5,6.904316730828898E-5,7.002808326121311E-5,6.782754536684786E-5,6.764009929628416E-5,6.932729696240815E-5,6.812

{"value":"Picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says \"lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public (also black) in the street and ask him if he is black, then walk away\". The other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode. More laughter. Now if you think the premise is funny, and the show contains many such types of situation, you will enjoy this show. For the rest, use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry. Those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny. Another example of the humor in the show, a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier. Marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers?

{"value":"Yeah, unfortunately I came across the DVD of this and found that it was incredibly awful.<br /><br />First of all, the characters suck. I mean, come on, if some dork in an orange hat who calls himself 'Orange Sherbert' is the best creative idea these guys could come up for a character, then they should definitely not be in the film-making scene. Poor \"costumes\", bad \"interviews\", and basically there is not one \"wrestler\" on this whole disc with any shred of charisma.<br /><br />The \"wrestling\" in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline. They make sure to giggle together all the while, too, making the experience seem more like a toddler's playtime than a \"wrestling deathmatch\".<br /><br />Basically, Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a pretty lackluster Backyard Wrestling clone. Only, instead of blood, weapons, mayhem, and WRESTLING, we get a trampoline, giggling kids, TERRIBLE audio, and some guy called Orange Sherbert.<br /><br />Wrestling fan or not, avoid this DVD.

{"value":"Closer to reality and containing more depth than \"Breakdance\", Stan Lathan's \"Beat Street\" is still a pretty dull show. Again this pic is really only cashing in on the 'breakin' craze but at least we get a little bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.<br /><br />Lathan is unable to generate any real audience interest in the story though, and his young cast are likewise struggling with their characters. Therefore it is left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day.<br /><br />Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, but this alone is not enough to lift \"\"Beat Street\" to greater heights.

{"value":"SAKURA KILLERS (1+ outta 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this movie might have seemed cool... if you had never ever seen a *good* ninja movie. Cheesy '80s music... cheesy dialogue... cheesy acting... and way-beyond-cheesy martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is at the beginning... with an aged Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach... several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice... suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and... naw, I won't spoil it for you... if you ever have the misfortune of seeing this movie you'll thank me. The story is a lot of nonsense about some stolen videotape or something. A bunch of dim-bulb Caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because \"only a ninja can fight a ninja\" or something like that. Strange, these guys don't seem to fight any better after their training than before... oh well, the movie does move along pretty briskly. The fight scenes may not be great.. but they are plentiful... and the overdone sound effects are good for a few

{"value":"The French film \"Extension Du Domaine De La Lutte\" directed by iconoclast film maker Philippe Harel is based on the book of the same name written by a controversial writer Michel Houellebecq.He has also worked on this film's scenario.According to British cinema magazine Sight and Sound,it is also known as \"Whatever\".This film has been hailed as a breath of fresh air for French cinema due to its not so common theme of sexual politics and its implications on two stupid information technology workers.The film is marred by its much too evident voice over which introduces us to the main character.This makes us viewers feel as if we are watching a book that is bring read. The basic premise of problems related to loneliness due to chronic sexual drought is fine but the film goes out of hand once the hero starts recounting the misery faced by him and his friend.Instead of sticking to its main topic the film veers in other directions leading to its downfall.Beware:some women viewers might find not only the film but even its two heroes as moronic

{"value":"When people ask me whats the worst movie I've ever seen its this one. Its not even close to MST3k level riffing, or midnight viewing at a theatre, or even as Disney channel late night filler. The only time I've ever wanted to jump off a ride at Disney World (or Disney/MGM Studios in this case) was to grab Dick Tracey's jacket off the mannequin, rip it to shreds, and ram it down the tour guides throat saying \"Eat this! Eat this unholy coat of darkness!!!\" I've never been so mad at a movie, not even \"Nutty Professor II: The Klumps\" or \"Flash Gordon\". You want pretty colors and cinematography? Ain't here babe. Reviewers keep saying \"oh, but its too look like a comic book\", well, to me, its the color of a Gordito after several weeks in the sun. About as enjoyable too. Beatty wanders around this landscape jumping around and talking to his watch, himself, and occasional at the other actors, hoping someone will tell him what time the sequel will begin shooting.

{"value":"To be honest, i'm surprised by the positive votes that this film has received. The movie just drags along its 81 minute life span, and the audience has to suffer the whole way through. Actually there are some positive moments in this film; Charlie Spradling gives a decent performance. She is given some pretty pathetic dialogue and she handles it pretty well. Scott Valentine(Merrideth's boyfriend in Family Ties), on the other hand, is a pretty rough watch. I guess the highlight of his performance is witnessing the guy laying on the beach wearing tiger-patterned chummies....give me a break. Also, Valentine gives us a boorish and pathetic portrayal of a suffering vampire who misses the day(to see a much more convincing rendition of the suffering vampire see Denice Duff in \"Bloodstorm: Subspecies 4\"). The movie moves so slow and is only positively punctuated by, and to be honest, Charlie Spradling's dance scenes.

{"value":"I'd never heard of this, then found out it's the man with the deadly lens, which I'd heard of but not seen. Connery's presence drove me to buy it, and it's not good. It wants to be a sort of cross between Dr Strangelove and Mash, but it just isn't that funny, unless you find the name General Wombat (?) funny. It comes across as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes, when it springs to life. There are many, many flat scenes in the Whitehouse between the president and his aides which don't work. It's almost as if the initial cut was too long, and the first half was edited down to get to the whole nuclear bomb ransom storyline and the suicide bomber attacks, which i think are meant to be played for laughs, but again, aren't that funny. The location filming is excellent but the studio stuff looks like cheap TV. I could not believe the man responsible for Key Largo, Crossfire and Elmer Gantry did this. Only laugh: Connery throws away his wig before putting on his helmet and jumping out of a plane.

{"value":"Here's yet another blasphemous European story in which they blast the religion of their country. (These atheist filmmakers are relentless.) Here we see a brutal blasting of Catholics and/or the Catholic clergy (and I am not Catholic).<br /><br />This won actually won an Academy Award for bes foreign film. That's probably because the story made Catholics and religious belief in general look extremely weak. One of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else. He's portrayed as nothing but an idiot. No wonder the secular- dominated Academy loved this movie.<br /><br />Also, there is some overacting fool who plays a guy who renounces his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters featured in the story. The daughters take turns seducing the \"seminary\" student (who states he studied for six years but says he's an agnostic!). I mean, how blasphemous IS this film??!!!<br /><br />This is a disgrace and another excellent example of the secular-progressive bigotry of the film business, worldwide (not just

{"value":"Alex D. Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third movie in the Home Alone empire. Four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote controlled toy car. Because of baggage confusion, grouchy Mrs. Hess (Marian Seldes) gets the car. She gives it to her neighbor, Alex (Linz), just before the spies turn up. The spies rent a house in order to burglarize each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car. Home alone with the chicken pox, Alex calls 911 each time he spots a theft in progress, but the spies always manage to elude the police while Alex is accused of making prank calls. The spies finally turn their attentions toward Alex, unaware that he has rigged devices to cleverly booby-trap his entire house. Home Alone 3 wasn't horrible, but probably shouldn't have been made, you can't just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci, or Daniel Stern. Home Alone 3 had some funny parts, but I don't like when characters are changed in a movie series, view at own

{"value":"Typical thriller, has been done many times before. Simple plot outline; cop Liotta becomes obsessed with Russell's wife, and he tries to bump off good ol' Kurt so he can have her. This is beyond predictable, it doesn't even try to make you guess, the plot is the plot and there's no thinking outside the box here. I guess then the only reason to watch it is to see how it develops, but nothing is done originally or interestingly. There's not really anything to say about this film, it's not particularly bad, but there's no good points either. Russell plays Russell and you know what you're gonna get when you see him in a film. Ditto Liotta. Stowe has an annoying Cher-esque voice. I read the plot outline and I could see the film in my head, it was so obvious and basic. I watched it and it rolled out in front of my eyes exactly as I had imagined. I felt not a drop of emotion throughout. I have no feeling towards this film, it's as if I never even watched it. Considering this, it's a pretty pointless film isn't it?

{"value":"When I saw this at a shop I thought it looked really good and original. Like Wolfs Creek meets Texas chainsaw massacre, and I mean it only cost three quid (around $6). To be honest I don't think it was even worth that.<br /><br />It seemed like the directors- the 'butcher brothers' couldn't decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a gory slasher horror. It ended up with a cliché ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimensional and you couldn't care less what happened to them but to try to make the audience care about the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film which to be perfectly honest wasn't needed.<br /><br />The only good part really was the middle/end- I won't ruin it for you. But that was the only \"good \"part.<br /><br />Overall a pointless watch. It felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes. If you want an artsy film-don't bother.

{"value":"I have nothing against religious movies. Religious people need something to watch on a Saturday night, I guess. But what really ticks me off is when the write-up on the DVD box does not indicate this fact to the potential viewer. Passing off religious propaganda as entertainment is NOT cool, bro.<br /><br />And even if I was a religious person, I would have to agree with most of the other posters here, this movie was a mess. Poorly directed, poorly acted, poorly edited, and the attempt at a soundtrack was hilarious. The fake accents were terrible, the characters were mainly stereotypes, and continuity was out the window. The only reason we sat through this lame waste of time was that it was too late to watch another movie instead. Should have just gone to bed.<br /><br />Absolutely no redeeming qualities to this movie, unless you are the religious type who will immediately endorse anything that will preach your beliefs to the unbelievers, even if it's a pile of garbage. If you aren't, avoid this at all costs.

{"value":"I wish I'd known more about this movie when I rented it. I'd put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong cred as an actress (IMHO). While parts of the movie were charming, much of the movie felt contrived, undeveloped, or otherwise just boring or predictable. Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple... I don't care how big a part of the story line that is, it still felt a bit, um, gross. And Charlie, for a zoologist, she certainly doesn't seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens. What was it about her (besides her hotness and some common interests) that made Gray fall for her? The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth. High points - Molly Shannon (although I do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion), the cabbie in drag, and the dance sequences (if Sam & Gray were such great dancers, I wish we'd seen more of that, as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie).

{"value":"A squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy. Elvis Presley plays an Indian bull-riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks' desert-spread in Arizona, where government suits have just invested in the family's herd of cattle (which is in dire need of a stud). What director Peter Tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills, though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages (his social commentary isn't exactly pointed, but Tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes). Despite colorful supporting turns by Katy Jurado and Joan Blondell, the general wackiness gets way out of hand, and there's too much hoopin' and hollerin' to sustain much interest. As for Elvis, he's loose and frisky throughout--and while it's nice to see him having fun on-screen, one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point.

{"value":"To call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of GASLIGHT (1939 & 1944) via LES DIABOLIQUES (1954); while still watchable in itself, it's so cliché-ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills. However, thanks to the dire straits in which the British film industry found itself in the late 1970s, even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract 10 star names - Cliff Robertson (as the conniving husband), Jean Simmons (in the title role), Jenny Agutter (as Robertson's artist half-sister), Simon Ward (as the enigmatic chauffeur), Ron Moody (as an ill-fated doctor), Michael Jayston (as Robertson's business partner), Judy Geeson (as Simmons' best friend and Jayston's wife), Flora Robson (as the housekeeper), David Tomlinson (as the notary reading Simmons' will) and, most

{"value":"The film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour. It starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good, funny story is to come. Well, I can tell you it will not come. It will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness. <br /><br />In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that, according to him, the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience. I was amazed to hear that. Am I living in the same world he lives in? OK a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all, but that doesn't make me feel like I am losing my identity. What does Khrzhanosvky think, that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch?

{"value":"There are movies like \"Plan 9\" that are so bad they have a charm about them, there are some like \"Waterworld\" that have the same inexplicable draw as a car accident, and there are some like \"Desperate living\" that you hate to admit you love. Cowgirls have none of these redemptions. The cast assembled has enough talent to make almost any plot watchable, and from what I've been told, the book is enjoyable.<br /><br />How then could this movie be so intolerably bad? To begin with, it seems the director brought together a cast of names with no other tie than what will bring in the 20 somethings. Then tell them to do their best Kevin Costner imitations. Open the book at random and start shooting whatever is on the page making sure to keep the wide expanses of America from being interesting in any way. Finally give the editing job to your brother-in-law, because the meat packing plant just laid him off. He does have twenty years of cutting experience.<br /><br />This movie now defines the basement for me.

{"value":"This is a German film from 1974 that is something to do with some women who come to a castle and beyond that, I can't really tell you their purpose or even what the purpose of the movie is. I can tell you that there's several women who also moonlight as servants at this particular castle who strip, put on body paint and gyrate to bongos like they were at the Goth Kit-Kat Klub, though, and that seems to be a good portion of the run time of this film. Yeah, there seems to be something with devil worship and vampires, and there's some girl on girl stuff, etc., but the main focus seems to be the painted babes gyrating away in the basement. I did rather like the eye-rolling of one of the main housekeepers/devil worshipers, that lent an authenticity to the proceedings and made her even more evil-looking. Was that Wanda the Evil Lesbian (as billed in the credits)? No matter.

{"value":"Any time a movie is so myopic in its desire to present a particular ending or viewpoint that it simply doesn't bother with an actual story, it's annoying. Those are the types of movies where the ending or viewpoint is conceived first, and the story simply tacked on. For this reason we often talk of the story \"jumping through hoops\" as it twists about, trying in vain to progress to the preordained ending in a logical fashion.<br /><br />The story in \"Comet Over Broadway\" doesn't just jump through hoops, it's a three ring circus. It's so ludicrous, so ill-conceived, so disingenuous that, if you are prone to speaking aloud to the screen, you will be carrying on quite a rant before it's through.<br /><br />The central theme of this screenplay cesspool is that of a woman choosing between family and profession. Since it's all so horribly muddled it will end up offensive to people of either opinion. So, in the end there's no point to the story, the theme becomes irrelevant and, as is often the case with poor screenplays, the acting doesn't save a thing.","finished_norm":["ani","time","a","movi","be","so","myopic","in","it","desir","to","present","a","particular","end","or","viewpoint","that","it","simpli","doe","not","bother","with","a","actual","stori","it","annoi","that","be","the","typ","of","movi","where","the","end","or","viewpoint","be","conceiv","and","the","stori","simpli","tack","on","for","thi","reason","we","often","talk","of","the","stori","jump","through","hoop","a","it","twist","about","try","in","vain","to","progress","to","the","preordain","end","in","a","logic","fashionbr","br","the","stori","in","comet","over","broadwai","doe","not","just","jump","through","hoop","it","a","three","ring","circu","it","so","ludicr","so","illconceiv","so","disingenu","that","if","you","be","prone","to","speak","aloud","to","the","screen","you","will","be","carri","on","quit","a","rant","befor","it","throughbr","br","the","central","theme","of","thi","screenplai","cesspool","be","that","of","a","woman","choos","between","famili","and","profess","sinc","it","all","so","horribli","muddl","it","will","end","up","offens","to","peopl","of","either","opinion","so","in","the","end","there","no","point","to","the","stori","the","theme","becom","irrelev","and","a","be","often","the","case","with","poor","screenplai","the","act","doe","not","save","a","thing"],"filtered":["ani","time","movi","myopic","desir","present","particular","end","viewpoint","simpli","doe","bother","actual","stori","annoi","typ","movi","end","viewpoint","conceiv","stori","simpli","tack","thi","reason","often","talk","stori","jump","hoop","twist","try","vain","progress","preordain","end","logic","fashionbr","br","stori","comet","broadwai","doe","jump","hoop","three","ring","circu","ludicr","illconceiv","disingenu","prone","speak","aloud","screen","carri","quit","rant","befor","throughbr","br","central","theme","thi","screenplai","cesspool","woman","choos","famili","profess","sinc","horribli","muddl","end","offens","peopl","either","opinion","end","point","stori","theme","becom","irrelev","often","case","poor","screenplai","act","doe","save","thing"],"filtered2":["ani","time","myopic","desir","present","particular","end","viewpoint","simpli","doe","bother","actual","stori","annoi","typ","end","viewpoint","conceiv","stori","simpli","tack","reason","often","talk","stori","jump","hoop","twist","try","vain","progress","preordain","end","logic","fashionbr","stori","comet","broadwai","doe","jump","hoop","three","ring","circu","ludicr","illconceiv","disingenu","prone","speak","aloud","screen","carri","quit","rant","befor","throughbr","central","theme","screenplai","cesspool","woman","choos","famili","profess","sinc","horribli","muddl","end","offens","peopl","either","opinion","end","point","stori","theme","becom","irrelev","often","case","poor","screenplai","act","doe","save","thing"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,17,18,21,23,24,27,29,36,52,66,70,79,95,115,120,146,162,182,186,189,192,201,207,224,271,288,344,384,400,411,435,496,533,538,584,621,674,703,832,973,1084,1145,1182,1263,1277,1394,1502,2233,2268,2530,2858,3002,3799,3808,3981,4534,4907,5204,5745,6793,7939],"values":[1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,17,18,21,23,24,27,29,36,52,66,70,79,95,115,120,146,162,182,186,189,192,201,207,224,271,288,344,384,400,411,435,496,533,538,584,621,674,703,832,973,1084,1145,1182,1263,1277,1394,1502,2233,2268,2530,2858,3002,3799,3808,3981,4534,4907,5204,5745,6793,7939],"values":[0.9418936859054116,6.385268470052984,3.6459479802144523,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,6.6051807830596285,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.4680183469605717,1.7122153074726136,1.929723173391612,2.094675786251684,1.9469506069506084,2.0323326556775485,2.201553588425805,2.2044500422972613,2.326138445979858,2.3586007221245198,2.7365296724240786,2.571852579609833,2.498193474075453,2.5318267134339894,5.122871637503154,2.5531798379045583,2.689504733779216,2.757740698455715,2.8015621426949333,2.983093497946387,3.109204957709252,6.261889888691316,3.229006157521873,3.2829611516442836,3.293679367864308,6.986785334740263,3.43462735814388,3.5146700658174166,3.5446859617576822,7.281100623412839,7.349324292426565,3.7987743169213135,4.072271754381138,4.224077767249142,4.2574141875167335,4.327618446189983,4.390138803171316,4.297765483040301,4.403125998698128,4.566029469634981,5.039114765418124,5.373120909544144,5.156897801074508,5.373120909544144,5.482320201509136,5.719991853386255,5.822646007446338,5.850044981634453,11.999153431210834,6.255510089742618,6.1754673820690815,6.342521466732247,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.925682546098639E-5,4.892467517159721E-5,4.930501786897418E-5,4.90201329504633E-5,4.902093609015119E-5,

{"value":"...when he remade Broadway BILL (1934) as RIDING HIGH (1950). Recasting Bing Crosby as DAN BROOKS did not help a screenplay that was 'dated' in 34 let alone 50. This sad film has entire scenes lifted from the original with many of the supporting cast repeating their roles, unless they were dead. Though being older did not seem to matter to the Director. Nor that the Cars and Clothes in the background plates from 1934 did not seem match up too 1950s' standards. Not even 'der Bingel' singing can redeem this effort.<br /><br />We rated both the original and the remake IMDb Four****Stars. Frank's touch was long gone and all that was left was CAPRA-CORN. That did not stop Mr. Capra though. After floundering around the 50's making some educational documentaries he wound up his career remaking LADY FOR A DAY (1933) as POCKETFUL OF MIRACLES (1961). Again a fine cast was let down on that IMDb Six******Star effort compared too the originals Eight********Stars.

{"value":"I actually felt bad for the actors in this thing. No doubt a high school drama class could do a better job or at the very least as well a job. The actors must have thought this would be their big chance working in a film, it certainly was not. Besides the terrible acting the stories were boring and for the most part predictable. The one about the remote control didn't even make any sense. To bad cause it had the best premise in the bunch.<br /><br />I'm all for supporting low budget films and giving new film makers a fair chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the viewer. I only watched it because of some good comments posted here. They must have been planted by people with ties to the film. You may fool people into watching this, but you can't fool them into liking what they saw.<br /><br />I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story tried to be heart warming. Sure it failed miserably, but it tried. I reserve 1 s for the worst of the worst.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and skip this dribble.

{"value":"Very much a film from the times -- extremely long sequences with no dialogue, bad flashbacks, and an almost entirely male cast. The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men.<br /><br />O'Toole is riveting whenever he speaks; unfortunately, he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery. Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he, too, is terribly underused.<br /><br />The film has one additional positive aspect, in that it depicts many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies (such as the casual appearance of the Mosley graffiti) that many people today are unaware of. Too many of today's films about WWII paint the Allies as all-good and the Axis as all-evil, when history tells us people are far more complicated than that!<br /><br />This would be a good movie for when you're recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex.

{"value":"After seeing this film I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound-track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty. For at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20's music and the scratchiness of the sound-track. I was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so - it was the Director.<br /><br />I was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film. The music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film. These days, directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique. Unfortunately, no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same.<br /><br />So apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film (which you can find out for yourself elsewhere) the sound-track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss.

{"value":"It's just breathtaking in it's awfulness-- you really must see it!<br /><br />Depending on your perspective, Dylan Walsh is either the savior or the problem here: since he's the only one on screen that can actually get his lines out with something akin to natural cadences and inflection, he either ruins the movie by pointing up everyone else's flaws, or he saves it by providing some context for their awfulness.<br /><br />I'm inclined to the later view-- thanks to him, it works as high comedy. He's the 7 footer in a game of dwarf basketball, his skill set just doesn't apply in this context, and his discombobulation is delicious.<br /><br />The real treat though is Ms. Eastwood, whose inability to speak in plain English is so pervasive I actually googled her, expecting to learn that she was a Russian beauty who pronounced her lines phonetically, with no understanding of their meaning. But no: she's just a talent free American who will leave you laughing with every line she drops.

{"value":"A group of human looking aliens going to Earth to eat crash land on a planet of prehistoric beasts instead where they all eat physcedelic mushrooms and act retarded. Padded with footage from \"Planet of the Dinosuars\" and horrible jokes this is definitely one to miss. The acting is atrocious as well, and while this isn't as bad as \"Chickboxer\" (what movie can be?) This is still pretty awful repugnant stuff. It's 90 minute running time feels like an eternity and you will likely be cursing life so do yourself a huge favor and just move on, skip this crappy film, there's nothing to see here.<br /><br />The film-makers try to resell this turd as a MST3K style making fun of the movie they made a decade before, and it works to an extent it's still nothing that watchable though, Ariauna Albright is hot, but Lilith Stabs has a pretty unattractive speaking voice.<br /><br />My Grade: D- <br /><br />DVD Extras: Joke commentary, 17 Behind the scenes featurette; 7 minute Into the black featurette; Jessica

{"value":"Having read many of the comments here, I'm surprised that no one has recognized this as basically an overlong remake of a Twilight Zone episode from 1960 called \"Mirror Image,\" starring Vera Miles. Rod Serling did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minutes than Sean Ellis did in 88 minutes with this tedious snooze. A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending, but in a feature film, there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense. Sadly, substance and sense are two things missing from \"The Broken.\" Yes, it has some moments, but they are not enough to justify your time. Some further observations: although this is clearly a contemporary story, not one character in the movie has a cellphone! And even though a car accident is the event that gets the story going, there is never any reference to an insurance company, to the person who was driving the other car, or to the police who would have been required to do a report.

{"value":"While some performances were good-Victoria Rowell, Adrienne Barbeau, and the two Italian girlfriends come to mind-the story was lame and derivative, the emphasis on the girlfriend's racial background was handled clumsily at best, and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes, not as real people. I found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moments that were supposed to be funny. I can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in SF said this was a good movie, and wonder WHO posted the glowing review here on IMDb. Very disappointed in this movie, and mad I actually went to a theatre to see it, based on the faulty connection to Garden State, which is a far funnier, more inventive, and touching movie than this one. I must especially mention the emotional climax in the church, which was so wooden and by-the-numbers that I nearly left, and some in the audience actually DID. THAT was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard, which I saw coming 10 minutes before it happened.

{"value":"This beautifully filmed and scripted episode was let down for two reasons. 1) Perhaps it was the morality of the 1950s talking, but no man left alone on an asteroid for years would react with such hysterical negativity to the gift of a female android. 2) It wasn't an android at all, but a woman, the beautiful Jean Marsh.<br /><br />The popularity of the sex doll industry in the coming decades could have traced its origins back to this episode if they'd done it properly. In fact, the modernization of sex-bots are in the news as I speak.<br /><br />Robots were not new to movies or television when this episode was made, so they could have at least had her act like one. Her fleshiness would then have added a creepy element. Instead, it becomes a nice little love story about two humans on faraway star.<br /><br />The Twilight Zone always stretched the imagination and credulity. Normally no one cared. But this episode seemed hamstrung by a Calvinist morality eschewing what would have amounted to masturbation with a machine, or downright

{"value":"I can't help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tear-jerking. For one, it's entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homes.<br /><br />How can these families afford to maintain these new mega-houses? And what about their poor neighbors? Property taxes must surely increase after this happens. Plus, the noise would annoy me.<br /><br />Second, how excessive can a reality television show become? It's practically the same repetitive junk week after week. We're introduced to a suffering family, they renovate the home, then surprise the family and everyone breaks out the Kleenex boxes.<br /><br />Not to mention how boring the renovation part is. The only interesting part of the show is to see what the house looks like, but even that segment is destroyed by the phony confessionals and constant sobbing.<br /><br />\"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\" is a show pretending to be heartfelt but it falls flat. Skip this one.
