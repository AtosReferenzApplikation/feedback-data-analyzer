{"value":"This movie is funny and painful at the same time. The \"Cinemagic\" almost gave me a seizure. Despite what they imply, \"Cinemagic\" is not some innovative technical procedure. It was \"developed\" as the result of an accident, and they used it because it disguised the fact that their \"monsters\" were so stupid-looking. I also don't think it's a coincidence that the writer is Sid \"Pink\".<br /><br />This movie is good for a laugh, if you are really looking for a movie made in 9 days on 200,000 dollars. It is entertaining; at least I can say that about it. The bat/rat/spider is the highlight.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","funni","and","pain","at","the","same","time","the","cinemag","almost","give","me","a","seizur","despit","what","thei","impli","cinemag","be","not","some","innov","technic","procedur","it","be","develop","a","the","result","of","a","accid","and","thei","us","it","becaus","it","disguis","the","fact","that","their","monster","be","so","stupidlook","i","conjur","do","not","think","it","a","coincid","that","the","writer","be","sid","pinkbr","br","thi","movi","be","good","for","a","laugh","if","you","be","realli","look","for","a","movi","make","in","dai","on","dollar","it","be","entertain","at","littl","i","can","sai","that","about","it","the","batratspid","be","the","highlight"],"filtered":["thi","movi","funni","pain","time","cinemag","almost","give","seizur","despit","thei","impli","cinemag","innov","technic","procedur","develop","result","accid","thei","us","becaus","disguis","fact","monster","stupidlook","conjur","think","coincid","writer","sid","pinkbr","br","thi","movi","good","laugh","realli","look","movi","make","dai","dollar","entertain","littl","sai","batratspid","highlight"],"filtered2":["funni","pain","time","cinemag","almost","give","seizur","despit","impli","cinemag","innov","technic","procedur","develop","result","accid","us","becaus","disguis","fact","monster","stupidlook","conjur","think","coincid","writer","sid","pinkbr","good","laugh","realli","look","make","dai","dollar","entertain","littl","batratspid","highlight"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,8,12,13,14,16,22,30,39,56,62,97,131,132,133,195,287,320,391,413,447,458,944,1038,1325,1385,2202,2275,2747,2810,4941,6286,7307],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,8,12,13,14,16,22,30,39,56,62,97,131,132,133,195,287,320,391,413,447,458,944,1038,1325,1385,2202,2275,2747,2810,4941,6286,7307],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,1.3364419891718522,1.5538940054862738,1.8610609350701788,2.0226120445069267,2.0545557924622586,2.2512118082053005,2.253494045787767,2.3212364753796515,2.51289241584188,2.841890188081905,2.938298364153555,3.109204957709252,3.467417180966871,3.2070272508030975,3.2829611516442836,3.969732115064953,4.145296889396028,4.422928625994308,4.403125998698128,5.02684467282631,5.064116067623542,5.3560264761848435,5.3064295350454715,6.214688095222362,6.489124940924123,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.51170903213741E-4,3.5085971292284627E-4,3.5094634289629446E-4,3.508757914556076E-4,3.509089976872763E-4,3.508577783882374E-4,3.509669000283842E-4,3.508055764732556E-4,3.508597870734598E-4,3.512223626441014E-4,3.5400920986479895E-4,3.5086036660309823E-4,3.511926535423776E-4,3.5122924175783906E-4,3.510696874841324E-4,3.5087717350456616E-4,3.509978888223519E-4,3.5116306962212934E-4,3.508952877801604E-4,3.5089400487217366E-4,3.512096873708982E-4,3.509291608691028E-4,3.509296919699753E-4,3.5115450128799647E-4,3.508954143569263E-4,3.51233439814196E-4,3.509832245757993E-4,3.5085892657342775E-4,3.510179910168056E-4,3.511251267674752E-4,3.5093088223343355E-4,3.5111883317189176E-4,3.5129122375336067E-4,3.5161727647975465E-4,3.509826180669197E-4,3.508769606919982E-4,3.5100347165174654E-4,3.5091259552399865E-4,3.5080595089318086E-4,3.508951791136E-4,3.51246836047508E-4,3.5105415504796693E-4,3.511196333112162E-4,3.5082341046619933E-4,3.5089526833735493E-4,3.5087682874886415E-4,3.509955973741101E-4,3.5105646044940287E-4,3.509850751019152E-4,3.509294433474089E-4,3.508776964403E-4,3.5159658785865143E-4,3.5096598737600665E-4,3.508951879126049E-4,3.5096410782315383E-4,3.5085928554980605E-4,0.9722691552224233,3.5091402545759233E-4,3.508781890276765E-4,3.508590852703783E-4,3.5113978095504964E-4,3.5099882464468445E-4,3.5085893860206815E-4,3.5082326753280884E-4,3.507879883780024E-4,3.5110515624868087E-4,3.508761269279104E-4,3.5103562216471106E-4,3.511386422206818E-4,3.5097933745168873E-4,3.508956526616573E-4,3.508237274387349E-4,3.509134746301313E-4,3.508235384807303E-4,3.5084194913266185E-4,3.508237373679208E-4,3.5105147099767485E-4,3.5094698684550693E-4,3.508594069084411E-4,3.5089339421958077E-4]}}
{"value":"Eddie Murphy's \"Delirious\" is completely and totally rude, crude, crass and lude. This is indeed the only way to describe this appalling, trashy piece of stand-up. Eddie Murphy goes for shock value rather than laughs to try and win his following over. He does manage to be funny occasionally, but mostly loses the plot with obscene language and distasteful sex jokes.<br /><br />Forget it! Unless you happen to enjoy Eddie's foul style. I don't think I will bother with \"Eddie Murphy Raw\". I much prefer Eddie in the confines of a movie script.<br /><br />Saturday, January 17, 1998 -

{"value":"After a day at work, I sat down to relax and turned on the movie channels. The movie came up on the guide and sounded interesting so I tuned in just before it started. The first 30 minutes were enough to make me interested, but the lack of acting ability in Jamie Foxx and the slow plot movement made me want to get up and find food during the movie. If there is any credit to be given for acting in this movie it should go to David Morse who at least tries to make the movie interesting. All in all, don't plan on impressing your friends by picking this one as a renter for a movie night.","finished_norm":["after","a","dai","at","work","i","sit","down","to","relax","and","turn","on","the","movi","channel","the","movi","come","up","on","the","guid","and","sound","interest","so","i","tune","in","just","befor","it","start","the","minut","be","enough","to","make","me","interest","but","the","lack","of","act","abil","in","jami","foxx","and","the","slow","plot","movem","make","me","want","to","get","up","and","find","food","dure","the","movi","if","there","be","ani","credit","to","be","give","for","act","in","thi","movi","it","should","go","to","david","mors","who","at","littl","try","to","make","the","movi","interest","all","in","all","do","not","plan","on","impress","your","friend","by","pick","thi","on","a","a","renter","for","a","movi","night"],"filtered":["dai","work","sit","relax","turn","movi","channel","movi","come","guid","sound","interest","tune","befor","start","minut","enough","make","interest","lack","act","abil","jami","foxx","slow","plot","movem","make","want","get","find","food","dure","movi","ani","credit","give","act","thi","movi","go","david","mors","littl","try","make","movi","interest","plan","impress","friend","pick","thi","renter","movi","night"],"filtered2":["dai","work","sit","relax","turn","channel","come","guid","sound","interest","tune","befor","start","minut","enough","make","interest","lack","act","abil","jami","foxx","slow","plot","movem","make","want","get","find","food","dure","ani","credit","give","act","go","david","mors","littl","try","make","interest","plan","impress","friend","pick","renter","night"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,14,21,27,30,32,34,36,37,38,48,59,60,71,79,93,96,132,161,178,183,210,239,244,356,390,418,446,581,675,728,847,1389,1390,1659,2460,2818,3517,3684,7835],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,14,21,27,30,32,34,36,37,38,48,59,60,71,79,93,96,132,161,178,183,210,239,244,356,390,418,446,581,675,728,847,1389,1390,1659,2460,2818,3517,3684,7835],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.1175081997259209,2.324031090670098,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.6955116224012472,1.8693254449200722,5.514529923709773,1.9214926742550966,1.9469506069506084,2.035389827120098,2.0390708128715254,2.253494045787767,2.4323182980210873,2.532833256045391,2.4885128563647294,2.687151791517189,2.6593400337329487,2.634508058031767,3.028335462059722,3.132778125427319,3.164467636384302,3.233054746047873,3.530930586689197,3.749984152751882,3.7740817043309423,3.900174431363043,4.449957298382227,4.456830177669989,4.688631791727313,5.156897801074508,5.672363804397,6.489124940924123,5.672363804397,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040352005E-4,2.5580823473939334E-4,2.558713957686226E-4,2.558199574334827E-4,2.558441677579875E-4,2.558068242899598E-4,2.5588638376376E-4,2.557687644066798E-4,2.5580828880184865E-4,2.5607263894884277E-4,2.5810450080632474E-4,2.5580871133099156E-4,2.560509783460783E-4,2.5607765444043946E-4,2.559613250483813E-4,2.5582096507126897E-4,2.5590897737707495E-4,2.5602940901184974E-4,2.5583417200467475E-4,2.558332366495589E-4,2.560633975365531E-4,2.558588685280098E-4,2.5585925574823383E-4,2.560231619269082E-4,2.5583426429050255E-4,2.560807152004711E-4,2.558982858246218E-4,2.558076614200602E-4,2.559236336818264E-4,2.560017452638828E-4,2.5586012355716976E-4,2.559971566675947E-4,2.561228448805955E-4,2.5636056659471306E-4,2.558978436251896E-4,2.5582080991179825E-4,2.5591304776099105E-4,2.558467909040112E-4,2.557690373924248E-4,2.5583409277699494E-4,2.5609048225741575E-4,2.5595000050774485E-4,2.559977400410074E-4,2.5578176698886647E-4,2.5583415782912377E-4,2.558207137134062E-4,2.559073067055554E-4,2.5595168135239576E-4,2.558996350243208E-4,2.558590744800589E-4,2.558213463383738E-4,2.5634548273227836E-4,2.558857183582288E-4,2.558340991922596E-4,2.5588434799543233E-4,2.5580792314607275E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.55847833453996E-4,2.558217054788011E-4,2.558077771243867E-4,2.5601242948243764E-4,2.559096596755837E-4,2.558076701900191E-4,2.557816627775907E-4,2.5575594110598885E-4,2.5598718496251037E-4,2.5582020202291383E-4,2.5593648837176654E-4,2.560115992428355E-4,2.558954517621167E-4,2.55834438036049E-4,2.557819980903062E-4,2.5584743185131764E-4,2.557818603229541E-4,2.557952833413217E-4,2.5578200532957426E-4,2.559480435940785E-4,2.5587186526541934E-4,2.5580801162741464E-4,2.558327914289876E-4]}}
{"value":"If you seen Rodney Dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck. Written like a sitcom, this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout, from the self-help doctor played by the aways sexy-as-chopped liver Molly Shannon to the 'I'm fat, and therefore funny' John Linette. The 5 wives themselves are likeable enough, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. Instead, it comes off like a male fantasy that's trying hard not to be politically

Then again, I always thought most of my old classmates were demons, vampires and serial killers, too.","finished_norm":["the","big","nation","lampoon","hit","remain","anim","hous","and","rightli","so","it","be","funni","raucou","and","goodnaturedbr","br","the","exact","opposit","of","everi","other","nation","lampoon","film","includ","class","reunionbr","br","pleas","do","not","be","fool","by","the","inclus","of","stephen","furst","flounder","from","anim","hous","or","by","the","fact","that","john","hugh","write","thi","jumbl","mess","thi","reunion","be","about","a","hilari","a","root","canal","and","twice","a","painfulbr","br","on","star","and","that","be","gener","then","again","i","alwai","think","much","of","my","old","classmat","be","demon","vampir","and","serial","killer","too"],"filtered":["big","nation","lampoon","hit","remain","anim","hous","rightli","funni","raucou","goodnaturedbr","br","exact","opposit","everi","nation","lampoon","film","includ","class","reunionbr","br","pleas","fool","inclus","stephen","furst","flounder","anim","hous","fact","john","hugh","write","thi","jumbl","mess","thi","reunion","hilari","root","canal","twice","painfulbr","br","star","gener","alwai","think","much","old","classmat","demon","vampir","serial","killer"],"filtered2":["big","nation","lampoon","hit","remain","anim","hous","rightli","funni","raucou","goodnaturedbr","exact","opposit","everi","nation","lampoon","includ","class","reunionbr","pleas","fool","inclus","stephen","furst","flounder","anim","hous","fact","john","hugh","write","jumbl","mess","reunion","hilari","root","canal","twice","painfulbr","star","gener","alwai","think","old","classmat","demon","vampir","serial","killer"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,62,65,67,82,85,97,100,197,213,225,252,277,291,301,346,388,407,485,628,632,682,1055,1057,1073,1134,1255,1347,1363,1652,1721,2609,2881,3451,4498,4764,5753,5809,6792,6833],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,62,65,67,82,85,97,100,197,213,225,252,277,291,301,346,388,407,485,628,632,682,1055,1057,1073,1134,1255,1347,1363,1652,1721,2609,2881,3451,4498,4764,5753,5809,6792,6833],"values":[1.066728610262888,2.0226120445069267,1.9073850067444174,1.9570915389266579,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.0545557924622586,2.1405462403177813,2.558331832813986,5.6865257437877545,2.641219492619754,3.0433232530252132,6.232798466686559,3.016831637578237,2.8309760279012264,3.023389038124396,3.0914425013694116,3.120015873813468,4.160564361526816,3.607563812710113,3.541919708264792,3.6497387377608255,8.492356228499617,4.181290492043933,4.535724120139652,4.403125998698128,4.291900363587903,4.566029469634981,4.396611317676934,4.646072177308517,4.760735085628657,5.521540914662417,11.43998370677251,5.770002273960917,6.0662680901040895,6.101359409915359,6.389041482367141,6.389041482367141,6.600350576034347,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.7310929654841815E-4,2.72867280593619E-4,2.729346536330477E-4,2.7287978503727245E-4,2.7290560987210094E-4,2.728657760857531E-4,2.729506411303965E-4,2.72825178108675E-4,2.728673382613293E-4,2.7314931708741474E-4,2.753166774155834E-4,2.728677889676105E-4,2.7312621200724255E-4,2.731546670463565E-4,2.730305800133634E-4,2.728808598712505E-4,2.729747414406555E-4,2.731032042820176E-4,2.7289494753346785E-4,2.7289394980246396E-4,2.7313945939443275E-4,2.7292129099019594E-4,2.7292170403291776E-4,2.7309654059864806E-4,2.7289504597354696E-4,2.73157931918839E-4,2.729633369022278E-4,2.7286666904142445E-4,2.729903751282307E-4,2.730736957257881E-4,2.729226297132996E-4,2.730688011304591E-4,2.732028710947007E-4,2.7345644572155113E-4,2.7296286521390754E-4,2.728806943646832E-4,2.729790832656609E-4,2.7290840794747494E-4,2.728254692989799E-4,2.7289486302234346E-4,2.7316835031006314E-4,2.7301850027476316E-4,2.7306942340720824E-4,2.7283904779213373E-4,2.72894932412594E-4,2.7288059175112323E-4,2.7297295935731187E-4,2.730202932096523E-4,2.7296477607580724E-4,2.7292151067653884E-4,2.728812665638583E-4,2.734403559638168E-4,2.7294993135106526E-4,2.728948698654219E-4,2.7294846960308793E-4,2.7286694822112084E-4,0.9784334310143922,2.7290952002183614E-4,2.728816496542301E-4,2.728667924617082E-4,2.73085092441243E-4,2.7297546923950387E-4,2.7286667839622426E-4,2.7283893663133604E-4,2.7281149966243055E-4,2.7305816444375507E-4,2.7288004593760276E-4,2.730040870569746E-4,2.7308420683557546E-4,2.729603138450163E-4,2.7289523130563697E-4,2.728392943050009E-4,2.7290909163753946E-4,2.728391473503778E-4,2.728534655075828E-4,2.72839302027033E-4,2.730164128606851E-4,2.7293515443910774E-4,2.728670426030048E-4,2.7289347489153437E-4]}}

{"value":"Portly nice guy falls for a luscious blonde; she likes him too, but not for the reasons you might think. Little-seen black comedy from writer Pat Proft features very good performances by Joe Alaskey and Donna Dixon, yet it makes no lasting impact. It's just a quickie throwaway effort, helmed by Norman Bates himself, Anthony Perkins. Even on the level of B-comedies, the somewhat-similar \"Eating Raoul\" is a better bet. There's definitely an amusing set-up here; unfortunately, the picture has nowhere to go in its second act. An interesting try, but it misfires.<br /><br />** from ****","finished_norm":["portli","nice","gui","fall","for","a","lusciou","blond","she","like","him","too","but","not","for","the","reason","you","mai","think","littleseen","black","comedi","from","writer","pat","proft","featur","veri","good","perform","by","joe","alaskei","and","donna","dixon","yet","it","make","no","last","impact","it","just","a","quicki","throwawai","effort","helm","by","norman","bate","himself","anthoni","perkin","even","on","the","level","of","bcomedi","the","somewhatsimilar","eat","raoul","be","a","well","bet","there","definit","a","amus","setup","here","unfortun","the","pictur","have","nowher","to","go","in","it","act","a","interest","try","but","it","misfiresbr","br","from"],"filtered":["portli","nice","gui","fall","lusciou","blond","like","reason","mai","think","littleseen","black","comedi","writer","pat","proft","featur","veri","good","perform","joe","alaskei","donna","dixon","yet","make","last","impact","quicki","throwawai","effort","helm","norman","bate","anthoni","perkin","even","level","bcomedi","somewhatsimilar","eat","raoul","well","bet","definit","amus","setup","unfortun","pictur","nowher","go","act","interest","try","misfiresbr","br"],"filtered2":["portli","nice","gui","fall","lusciou","blond","like","reason","mai","think","littleseen","black","comedi","writer","pat","proft","featur","veri","good","perform","joe","alaskei","donna","dixon","yet","make","last","impact","quicki","throwawai","effort","helm","norman","bate","anthoni","perkin","even","level","bcomedi","somewhatsimilar","eat","raoul","well","bet","definit","amus","setup","unfortun","pictur","nowher","go","act","interest","try","misfiresbr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,6,12,15,20,21,36,46,55,60,95,105,127,144,169,194,227,229,262,287,305,311,392,401,445,599,708,799,821,985,1451,1712,1795,1985,2179,3308,4159,4630,5503,5694,5797,7379,8553],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,6,12,15,20,21,36,46,55,60,95,105,127,144,169,194,227,229,262,287,305,311,392,401,445,599,708,799,821,985,1451,1712,1795,1985,2179,3308,4159,4630,5503,5694,5797,7379,8553],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.4680183469605717,1.655771293751733,1.9536997889255368,1.838176641236591,2.0323326556775485,2.1765612129984904,2.4359679371086367,2.2931108769894046,2.4071371113909277,2.5378812223426954,2.6005321873043625,2.8432628718938773,2.726701583487816,2.841890188081905,2.8612813773965557,2.9203338091782562,3.0670934723591254,3.0879275592619675,3.241201430615691,3.6254214301101193,3.6683728173057184,3.7636829971100436,4.339813719283801,4.170873731185678,4.499089986959872,4.85885294158718,4.77960356993304,4.869215728622727,5.426230734858092,6.101359409915359,6.1754673820690815,6.032366538428407,6.255510089742618,6.2980697041614135,6.437831646536572,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6148425534859354E-4,2.612525409305092E-4,2.613170462009934E-4,2.6126451311592587E-4,2.6128923870304415E-4,2.6125110046281385E-4,2.6133235318208836E-4,2.612122305600347E-4,2.61252596143563E-4,2.6152257239224757E-4,2.635976778980412E-4,2.612530276652938E-4,2.6150045079199473E-4,2.615276946273664E-4,2.614088894243554E-4,2.612655421990289E-4,2.6135542764993473E-4,2.614784224027244E-4,2.612790302124765E-4,2.612780749504188E-4,2.6151313429716464E-4,2.613042523460798E-4,2.613046478074204E-4,2.6147204236255076E-4,2.6127912446240176E-4,2.615308205288302E-4,2.6134450855169804E-4,2.612519554093562E-4,2.6137039588135566E-4,2.614501698937487E-4,2.6130553408572875E-4,2.614454836394505E-4,2.61573846844978E-4,2.618166279341436E-4,2.613440569410398E-4,2.6126538373733585E-4,2.6135958466286957E-4,2.612919176768646E-4,2.6121250935567074E-4,2.612789492986127E-4,2.6154079545573903E-4,2.613973238661975E-4,2.6144607942866165E-4,2.612255098731045E-4,2.612790157352306E-4,2.6126528549157623E-4,2.6135372142190814E-4,2.6139904048386777E-4,2.6134588646609526E-4,2.613044626813577E-4,2.612659315805514E-4,2.618012230454303E-4,2.6133167361488854E-4,2.612789558504119E-4,2.613302740869846E-4,2.612522227056217E-4,0.9793514233938594,2.612929824151943E-4,2.6126629836447957E-4,2.6125207357619056E-4,2.614610815020015E-4,2.613561244696414E-4,2.612519643659641E-4,2.612254034439247E-4,2.6119913434406635E-4,2.61435299708924E-4,2.61264762910896E-4,2.613835241546232E-4,2.614602335926061E-4,2.613416141725106E-4,2.612793019057336E-4,2.6122574589302147E-4,2.6129257226530106E-4,2.612256051935994E-4,2.6123931389089393E-4,2.612257532863612E-4,2.613953253040002E-4,2.613175256899794E-4,2.61252313070091E-4,2.6127762025432335E-4]}}
{"value":"I rented it because the second segment traumatized me as a little kid. I snuck downstairs really early one morning, started watching HBO, and The Raft (segment 2) terrorized me good. This time around, I still enjoyed The Raft, although I couldn't tell whether it was for nostalgic reasons or if it was actually a good short. The other two segments were complete trash. I can't believe a producer somewhere payed to make this junk. All I've accomplished by watching this was to ruin one more childhood memory.

{"value":"A poorly written script with no likeable characters. As for it being a comedy, I forgot to laugh. It's about 2 conceited friends who scam to get women in too bed with them (no sex scenes) and another friend(who is semi-discustingly weird)who sometimes also scams but mainly is considered as being the guy who masterbates. The 3 friends separately meet and fall for the same woman (Amanda Peet). Somehow this is done without really any romance. The 3 guys stop being friends as they separately dated her. She scammed them out of their friendship because they scammed women. -- A bad movie","finished_norm":["a","poorli","write","script","with","no","likeabl","charact","a","for","it","be","a","comedi","i","forget","to","laugh","it","about","conceit","friend","who","scam","to","get","woman","in","too","bed","with","them","no","sex","scene","and","anoth","friendwho","be","semidiscustingli","weirdwho","sometim","conjur","scam","but","mainli","be","consid","a","be","the","gui","who","masterb","the","friend","separ","meet","and","fall","for","the","same","woman","amanda","peet","somehow","thi","be","do","without","realli","ani","romanc","the","gui","stop","be","friend","a","thei","separ","date","her","she","scam","them","out","of","their","friendship","becaus","thei","scam","woman","a","bad","movi"],"filtered":["poorli","write","script","likeabl","charact","comedi","forget","laugh","conceit","friend","scam","get","woman","bed","sex","scene","anoth","friendwho","semidiscustingli","weirdwho","sometim","conjur","scam","mainli","consid","gui","masterb","friend","separ","meet","fall","woman","amanda","peet","somehow","thi","without","realli","ani","romanc","gui","stop","friend","thei","separ","date","scam","friendship","becaus","thei","scam","woman","bad","movi"],"filtered2":["poorli","write","script","likeabl","charact","comedi","forget","laugh","conceit","friend","scam","get","woman","bed","sex","scene","anoth","friendwho","semidiscustingli","weirdwho","sometim","conjur","scam","mainli","consid","gui","masterb","friend","separ","meet","fall","woman","amanda","peet","somehow","without","realli","ani","romanc","gui","stop","friend","separ","date","scam","friendship","becaus","scam","woman","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,9,10,13,19,22,27,39,55,65,70,73,77,125,127,133,161,169,254,315,317,350,372,398,500,549,647,892,1065,1210,1789,3179,3392,4571,4590,4610,6908],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,9,10,13,19,22,27,39,55,65,70,73,77,125,127,133,161,169,254,315,317,350,372,398,500,549,647,892,1065,1210,1789,3179,3392,4571,4590,4610,6908],"values":[0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,1.3002700588679295,1.5538940054862738,3.9073995778510735,1.9073850067444174,6.2840273587550515,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,2.2242236634876535,2.4359679371086367,2.3212364753796515,7.296954894063262,2.4071371113909277,2.889652074525771,2.854312708080462,2.8529247828056143,3.0135689919434205,3.0316467233633775,3.143848349181566,3.3814747511661465,3.4471119148061256,3.6746621462132825,3.9825254665248626,4.1302590120314875,4.274508620876034,9.521470171257315,5.583416318380505,5.672363804397,6.0662680901040895,24.85875238088945,6.389041482367141,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6148425534859354E-4,2.612525409305092E-4,2.6131704620099334E-4,2.612645131159258E-4,2.612892387030441E-4,2.612511004628138E-4,2.613323531820883E-4,2.6121223056003464E-4,2.6125259614356297E-4,2.6152257239224757E-4,2.6359771184470467E-4,2.6125302766529375E-4,2.615004507919947E-4,2.615276946273663E-4,2.614088894243553E-4,2.612655421990289E-4,2.613554276499347E-4,2.6147842240272434E-4,2.6127903021247646E-4,2.6127807495041874E-4,2.6151313429716464E-4,2.6130425234607976E-4,2.6130464780742035E-4,2.614720423625507E-4,2.612791244624017E-4,2.615308205288302E-4,2.61344508551698E-4,2.612519554093562E-4,2.613703958813556E-4,2.6145016989374863E-4,2.613055340857287E-4,2.6144548363945044E-4,2.6157384684497796E-4,2.618166279341436E-4,2.613440569410398E-4,2.6126538373733585E-4,2.613595846628695E-4,2.6129191767686454E-4,2.6121250935567074E-4,2.6127894929861263E-4,2.6154079545573903E-4,2.6139732386619744E-4,2.6144607942866165E-4,2.612255098731044E-4,2.6127901573523056E-4,2.612652854915762E-4,2.6135372142190814E-4,2.613990404838677E-4,2.6134588646609526E-4,2.6130446268135765E-4,2.612659315805514E-4,2.6180122304543025E-4,2.6133167361488854E-4,2.612789558504119E-4,2.6133027408698455E-4,2.6125222270562164E-4,0.9793514233599127,2.6129298241519427E-4,2.612662983644795E-4,2.612520735761905E-4,2.6146108150200143E-4,2.613561244696413E-4,2.612519643659641E-4,2.612254034439247E-4,2.611991343440663E-4,2.6143529970892393E-4,2.6126476291089595E-4,2.6138352415462315E-4,2.6146023359260607E-4,2.6134161417251054E-4,2.6127930190573354E-4,2.6122574589302147E-4,2.61292572265301E-4,2.6122560519359936E-4,2.6123931389089393E-4,2.6122575328636115E-4,2.6139532530400014E-4,2.613175256899794E-4,2.6125231307009097E-4,2.612776202543233E-4]}}

{"value":"Positively awful George Sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to police czar.<br /><br />While Sanders was an excellent character actor, he was certainly no leading man and this film proves it.<br /><br />It is absolutely beyond stupidity. Gene Lockhart did provide some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his gun with tragedy resulting.<br /><br />Sadly, George Sanders and co-star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life. After making a film as deplorable as this, it is not shocking.<br /><br />The usual appealing Signe Hasso is really nothing here.","finished_norm":["posit","aw","georg","sander","vehicl","where","he","go","from","be","a","thief","to","polic","czarbr","br","while","sander","be","a","excel","charact","actor","he","be","certainli","no","lead","man","and","thi","film","prove","itbr","br","it","be","absolut","beyond","stupid","gene","lockhart","do","provid","some","comic","relief","until","a","moment","of","anger","lead","him","to","fire","hi","gun","with","tragedi","resultingbr","br","sadli","georg","sander","and","costar","carol","landi","commit","suicid","in","real","life","after","make","a","film","a","deplor","a","thi","it","be","not","shockingbr","br","the","usual","appeal","sign","hasso","be","realli","noth","here"],"filtered":["posit","aw","georg","sander","vehicl","go","thief","polic","czarbr","br","sander","excel","charact","actor","certainli","lead","man","thi","film","prove","itbr","br","absolut","beyond","stupid","gene","lockhart","provid","comic","relief","moment","anger","lead","fire","hi","gun","tragedi","resultingbr","br","sadli","georg","sander","costar","carol","landi","commit","suicid","real","life","make","film","deplor","thi","shockingbr","br","usual","appeal","sign","hasso","realli","noth"],"filtered2":["posit","aw","georg","sander","vehicl","go","thief","polic","czarbr","sander","excel","charact","actor","certainli","lead","man","prove","itbr","absolut","beyond","stupid","gene","lockhart","provid","comic","relief","moment","anger","lead","fire","gun","tragedi","resultingbr","sadli","georg","sander","costar","carol","landi","commit","suicid","real","life","make","deplor","shockingbr","usual","appeal","sign","hasso","realli","noth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,10,13,41,45,49,75,80,136,138,157,188,222,265,389,430,471,480,501,502,509,540,551,580,680,690,695,706,876,969,1373,1423,1754,1875,2192,2453,2462,3283,3649,5415,7536,7709],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,10,13,41,45,49,75,80,136,138,157,188,222,265,389,430,471,480,501,502,509,540,551,580,680,690,695,706,876,969,1373,1423,1754,1875,2192,2453,2462,3283,3649,5415,7536,7709],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.5687599167621034,1.8162961064622165,1.6920303308087352,1.9742250248702675,1.9951803900462557,2.346825985579986,2.2907365189289424,4.672030138951541,2.5378812223426954,2.5771019354959765,2.73529586597515,3.0914425013694116,3.1419947805322432,3.496027715008137,3.43462735814388,3.5119855004467477,3.3132665011396125,3.360519385990158,3.432149042129413,3.528202072035993,3.5039747767006686,7.619092827806449,3.634471265630037,3.6715125373103863,3.6284289511740746,3.8844878351953436,4.0536665665501035,4.456830177669989,4.470719289830655,4.751432692966343,4.911775343041523,5.129498826886393,5.156897801074508,5.156897801074508,5.7446844659766265,5.850044981634453,20.383519771425913,6.868614562629026,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.560351204035198E-4,2.5580823473939307E-4,2.558713957686224E-4,2.5581995743348244E-4,2.558441677579872E-4,2.5580682428995955E-4,2.5588638376375974E-4,2.557687644066795E-4,2.5580828880184843E-4,2.560726389488425E-4,2.581045052790768E-4,2.558087113309913E-4,2.5605097834607805E-4,2.560776544404392E-4,2.5596132504838103E-4,2.558209650712687E-4,2.559089773770747E-4,2.5602940901184947E-4,2.558341720046745E-4,2.5583323664955863E-4,2.5606339753655283E-4,2.558588685280095E-4,2.558592557482336E-4,2.5602316192690794E-4,2.558342642905023E-4,2.5608071520047084E-4,2.558982858246215E-4,2.5580766142005993E-4,2.559236336818261E-4,2.560017452638825E-4,2.558601235571695E-4,2.559971566675944E-4,2.5612284488059524E-4,2.563605665947128E-4,2.5589784362518934E-4,2.55820809911798E-4,2.559130477609908E-4,2.558467909040109E-4,2.5576903739242454E-4,2.5583409277699467E-4,2.560904822574155E-4,2.559500005077446E-4,2.559977400410072E-4,2.557817669888662E-4,2.558341578291235E-4,2.5582071371340595E-4,2.5590730670555515E-4,2.559516813523955E-4,2.5589963502432053E-4,2.558590744800586E-4,2.5582134633837355E-4,2.5634548273227814E-4,2.5588571835822855E-4,2.558340991922593E-4,2.5588434799543206E-4,2.558079231460725E-4,0.9797817241744331,2.558478334539957E-4,2.5582170547880085E-4,2.558077771243864E-4,2.5601242948243737E-4,2.5590965967558344E-4,2.558076701900188E-4,2.5578166277759047E-4,2.557559411059886E-4,2.559871849625101E-4,2.5582020202291356E-4,2.5593648837176627E-4,2.560115992428352E-4,2.558954517621165E-4,2.558344380360487E-4,2.5578199809030594E-4,2.5584743185131737E-4,2.5578186032295384E-4,2.5579528334132145E-4,2.55782005329574E-4,2.5594804359407825E-4,2.5587186526541906E-4,2.5580801162741436E-4,2.5583279142898734E-4]}}

{"value":"I agree with other users comments in that the two main roles were well acted, that being the guy that played Gary Gillmore and Giovanni's role. Too bad the story was so boring. Not hearing about the story I knew nothing of Gary Gillmore before the movie so I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be something like Dead Man Walking or The Chamber but how wrong I was. The whole movie was just talking, talking and talking about their mom and dad. The only cool scenes were the flashbacks where the dad would lose his temper. That was the only interest I got from this borefest.","finished_norm":["i","agre","with","other","user","comment","in","that","the","two","main","role","be","good","act","that","be","the","gui","that","plai","gari","gillmor","and","giovanni","role","too","bad","the","stori","be","so","bore","not","hear","about","the","stori","i","know","noth","of","gari","gillmor","befor","the","movi","so","i","do","not","know","what","to","expect","i","think","it","would","be","someth","like","dead","man","walk","or","the","chamber","but","how","wrong","i","be","the","whole","movi","be","just","talk","talk","and","talk","about","their","mom","and","dad","the","onli","cool","scene","be","the","flashback","where","the","dad","would","lose","hi","temper","that","be","the","onli","interest","i","get","from","thi","borefest"],"filtered":["agre","user","comment","two","main","role","good","act","gui","plai","gari","gillmor","giovanni","role","bad","stori","bore","hear","stori","know","noth","gari","gillmor","befor","movi","know","expect","think","someth","like","dead","man","walk","chamber","wrong","whole","movi","talk","talk","talk","mom","dad","onli","cool","scene","flashback","dad","lose","hi","temper","onli","interest","get","thi","borefest"],"filtered2":["agre","user","comment","two","main","role","good","act","gui","plai","gari","gillmor","giovanni","role","bad","stori","bore","hear","stori","know","noth","gari","gillmor","befor","know","expect","think","someth","like","dead","man","walk","chamber","wrong","whole","talk","talk","talk","mom","dad","onli","cool","scene","flashback","dad","lose","temper","onli","interest","get","borefest"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,9,11,12,17,19,21,25,26,40,45,47,49,53,55,60,79,108,111,128,130,179,186,216,221,228,280,294,481,622,1016,1051,1121,1726,2329,4651,5649],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,9,11,12,17,19,21,25,26,40,45,47,49,53,55,60,79,108,111,128,130,179,186,216,221,228,280,294,481,622,1016,1051,1121,1726,2329,4651,5649],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,2.5541073880211935,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,1.6284968758320737,1.8162961064622165,1.7064694353107215,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,1.9536997889255368,1.838176641236591,1.9469506069506084,2.138507503627933,2.1183455303375887,4.681980408231769,2.2642139034199635,2.507968722980095,7.7155577388294985,2.6070186965339692,2.6423424573643777,2.7742700004069256,2.8028805344481915,2.886778509330039,3.353630724994973,3.4933926673701317,8.69193516971636,4.191816905030921,4.403125998698128,9.823550686083045,5.143104478942172,6.2980697041614135,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040351994E-4,2.5580823473939323E-4,2.558713957686225E-4,2.558199574334826E-4,2.558441677579874E-4,2.558068242899597E-4,2.558863837637599E-4,2.557687644066797E-4,2.5580828880184854E-4,2.5607263894884266E-4,2.5810450080632474E-4,2.5580871133099145E-4,2.560509783460782E-4,2.5607765444043935E-4,2.559613250483812E-4,2.5582096507126886E-4,2.5590897737707484E-4,2.5602940901184963E-4,2.5583417200467464E-4,2.5583323664955874E-4,2.56063397536553E-4,2.558588685280097E-4,2.558592557482337E-4,2.560231619269081E-4,2.5583426429050244E-4,2.5608071520047095E-4,2.558982858246217E-4,2.558076614200601E-4,2.559236336818262E-4,2.560017452638827E-4,2.5586012355716966E-4,2.559971566675946E-4,2.561228448805954E-4,2.5636056659471295E-4,2.558978436251895E-4,2.5582080991179814E-4,2.5591304776099094E-4,2.5584679090401107E-4,2.557690373924247E-4,2.558340927769948E-4,2.5609048225741564E-4,2.5595000050774474E-4,2.559977400410073E-4,2.5578176698886636E-4,2.558341578291236E-4,2.558207137134061E-4,2.559073067055553E-4,2.5595168135239565E-4,2.5589963502432064E-4,2.558590744800588E-4,2.5582134633837366E-4,2.5634548273227825E-4,2.558857183582287E-4,2.5583409919225947E-4,2.558843479954322E-4,2.5580792314607264E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.558478334539959E-4,2.55821705478801E-4,2.558077771243866E-4,2.5601242948243753E-4,2.559096596755836E-4,2.5580767019001897E-4,2.557816627775906E-4,2.5575594110598875E-4,2.5598718496251026E-4,2.5582020202291367E-4,2.5593648837176643E-4,2.5601159924283536E-4,2.558954517621166E-4,2.5583443803604887E-4,2.557819980903061E-4,2.5584743185131753E-4,2.55781860322954E-4,2.557952833413216E-4,2.5578200532957416E-4,2.559480435940784E-4,2.5587186526541923E-4,2.558080116274145E-4,2.558327914289875E-4]}}
{"value":"This movie is chilling reminder of Bollywood being just a parasite of Hollywood. Bollywood also tends to feed on past blockbusters for furthering its industry.<br /><br />Vidhu Vinod Chopra made this movie with the reasoning that a cocktail mix of \"Deewar\" and \"On the Waterfront\" will bring home an Oscar. It turned out to be rookie mistake.<br /><br />Even the idea of the title is inspired from the Elia Kazan classic.

{"value":"In this forgettable trifle, the 40-ish Norma Shearer plays a fluttery, girlish socialite in Monte Carlo, caught in a tussle between George Sanders and Robert Taylor. It would be tempting to blame this movie's failure on the dull, talky script, or director George Cukor, who never seems interested in livening up the film's generally comatose state. Mostly, though, it's the fault of Shearer herself, who desperately wanted to keep playing \"young\" parts as long as she could get away with it. Inadvertently, this makes \"Her Cardboard Lover\" a bizarre monument to an aging woman's

A major misfire by Stanley Kramer.","finished_norm":["what","do","producerdirector","stanlei","kramer","see","in","adam","kennedi","novel","and","kennedi","veri","puzzl","screenplai","be","there","a","few","piec","leav","out","on","purpos","and","what","about","gene","hackman","richard","widmark","edward","albert","eli","wallach","and","mickei","roonei","what","do","thei","see","in","thi","veri","muddl","storybr","br","and","why","do","candic","bergen","who","give","a","horribl","perform","accept","such","a","thankless","rolebr","br","the","domino","principl","want","to","be","on","the","same","foot","a","the","parallax","view","or","the","manchurian","candid","and","miss","the","mark","by","a","veri","wide","margin","a","major","misfir","by","stanlei","kramer"],"filtered":["producerdirector","stanlei","kramer","see","adam","kennedi","novel","kennedi","veri","puzzl","screenplai","piec","leav","purpos","gene","hackman","richard","widmark","edward","albert","eli","wallach","mickei","roonei","thei","see","thi","veri","muddl","storybr","br","candic","bergen","give","horribl","perform","accept","thankless","rolebr","br","domino","principl","want","foot","parallax","view","manchurian","candid","miss","mark","veri","wide","margin","major","misfir","stanlei","kramer"],"filtered2":["producerdirector","stanlei","kramer","see","adam","kennedi","novel","kennedi","veri","puzzl","screenplai","piec","leav","purpos","gene","hackman","richard","widmark","edward","albert","eli","wallach","mickei","roonei","see","veri","muddl","storybr","candic","bergen","give","horribl","perform","accept","thankless","rolebr","domino","principl","want","foot","parallax","view","manchurian","candid","miss","mark","veri","wide","margin","major","misfir","stanlei","kramer"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,15,30,37,74,105,218,230,255,312,404,474,641,703,717,741,794,981,1248,1582,1930,2062,2192,2366,2533,2800,3161,3212,3447,3523,3611,3660,3740,4208,4377,4502,4686,4808,4905,5219,6282,7238],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,15,30,37,74,105,218,230,255,312,404,474,641,703,717,741,794,981,1248,1582,1930,2062,2192,2366,2533,2800,3161,3212,3447,3523,3611,3660,3740,4208,4377,4502,4686,4808,4905,5219,6282,7238],"values":[1.3114004109387893,3.6001823395697077,1.3364419891718522,1.4876543214774305,1.9486336368009016,2.1765612129984904,2.5940874818617203,2.7121382192999195,2.6754694156628323,2.8824835850471584,3.1419947805322432,3.6466665387238555,3.7034641371169887,3.6746621462132825,3.7398317812878634,3.7165362186843414,3.7465885637507435,4.039936373738201,4.637773374493822,4.621379564718146,4.848596441419991,5.064116067623542,5.129498826886393,5.5623629091826725,5.156897801074508,5.322690055917252,5.7959777603641776,6.032366538428407,11.756431717202299,5.626901430320244,6.389041482367141,5.7446844659766265,5.878215858601149,5.907203395474402,5.967828017290836,12.202718819830718,6.437831646536572,13.086384324388797,6.660975197850782,6.1754673820690815,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278283E-4,2.505862069158131E-4,2.5064807858603353E-4,2.505976903047262E-4,2.506214064035924E-4,2.505848252590656E-4,2.5066276061866855E-4,2.5054754232407134E-4,2.505862598746463E-4,2.508452136206051E-4,2.528355973796035E-4,2.5058667377834775E-4,2.5082399519387317E-4,2.5085012672676965E-4,2.5073617206405766E-4,2.505986773727581E-4,2.5068489300962495E-4,2.5080286617253593E-4,2.5061161470196693E-4,0.5970101055134406,2.508361608610074E-4,2.506358070744792E-4,2.5063618639005247E-4,2.5079674661457346E-4,2.5061170510388677E-4,2.508531250049423E-4,2.506744197127899E-4,2.505856453001279E-4,2.5069925012294775E-4,2.507757671478342E-4,2.5063703648367747E-4,2.507712722224067E-4,2.5089439465660816E-4,2.5112726355820133E-4,2.506739865403452E-4,2.505985253806877E-4,2.506888803013838E-4,2.506239760011385E-4,2.5054780973712956E-4,2.506115370916281E-4,2.5086269267877027E-4,2.5072507870075743E-4,2.507718436869292E-4,2.505602794736537E-4,2.506116008157933E-4,2.50598431146074E-4,2.506832564429229E-4,2.507267252329182E-4,2.50675741370145E-4,2.506360088222566E-4,2.505990508567381E-4,2.511124876152885E-4,2.50662108796618E-4,2.506115433759326E-4,2.5066076640818544E-4,2.505859016833081E-4,0.3834349619680388,2.50624997268677E-4,2.5059940266573095E-4,2.50585758642485E-4,2.50786233260484E-4,2.506855613798026E-4,2.5058565389105827E-4,2.5056017738972995E-4,2.505349807961613E-4,2.5076150407809297E-4,2.5059792990114835E-4,2.5071184239933196E-4,2.5078541996925843E-4,2.506716435043773E-4,2.5061187530261986E-4,2.505605058574261E-4,2.5062460386425056E-4,2.5056037090243435E-4,2.505735199054816E-4,2.505605129489129E-4,2.507231617352094E-4,2.5064853849859876E-4,2.505859883584062E-4,2.50610262309128E-4]}}

learning about what not to do making a film, it can`t be worse in others words, even the presence of a oscar winner ( Mira Sorvino ) isn`t enough to justify the $ 3.00 dollars expended to see this film , the acting is horrendous and it seems the actors were just waiting to finish the daily shots to go home, it lead to nowhere and is boring, weak and bad, don`t expend time or money on this
