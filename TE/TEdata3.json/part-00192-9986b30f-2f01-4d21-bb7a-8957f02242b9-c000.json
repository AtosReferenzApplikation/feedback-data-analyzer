{"value":"Really bad shot on video \"film\" made by not one, not two, but three amateur video makers.<br /><br />If you're going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood, gore and nudity. There is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a Halloween store. There are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex. The lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talking.<br /><br />There seems to be no editing effects- fades, wipes etc. Once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes.<br /><br />Terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end credits.The werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the \"actors\" face. They didn't even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks, arms or wrists.<br /><br />I guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie.No reason at all to buy, rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video.","finished_norm":["realli","bad","shoot","on","video","film","make","by","not","on","not","two","but","three","amateur","video","makersbr","br","if","you","re","go","to","make","a","bad","horror","film","at","littl","throw","in","some","blood","gore","and","nuditi","there","be","some","blood","provid","by","latex","cut","off","arm","prop","bui","at","a","halloween","store","there","be","lesbian","and","hooker","but","no","nuditi","or","sex","the","lesbian","spend","a","lot","of","time","in","bed","but","onli","talkingbr","br","there","seem","to","be","no","edit","effect","fade","wipe","etc","onc","in","a","while","a","bite","of","black","appear","to","separ","scenesbr","br","terribl","music","by","bad","heavi","metal","band","whose","websit","take","up","the","major","of","the","end","creditsth","werewolf","be","repres","by","rubber","mask","that","be","attach","to","just","the","actor","face","thei","do","not","even","bother","to","appli","brown","makeup","to","their","neck","arm","or","wristsbr","br","i","guarante","a","year","old","with","a","video","camera","can","put","togeth","a","well","movieno","reason","at","all","to","bui","rend","or","watch","thi","film","except","a","a","exampl","of","how","not","to","make","a","low","budget","video"],"filtered":["realli","bad","shoot","video","film","make","two","three","amateur","video","makersbr","br","re","go","make","bad","horror","film","littl","throw","blood","gore","nuditi","blood","provid","latex","cut","arm","prop","bui","halloween","store","lesbian","hooker","nuditi","sex","lesbian","spend","lot","time","bed","onli","talkingbr","br","seem","edit","effect","fade","wipe","etc","onc","bite","black","appear","separ","scenesbr","br","terribl","music","bad","heavi","metal","band","whose","websit","take","major","end","creditsth","werewolf","repres","rubber","mask","attach","actor","face","thei","even","bother","appli","brown","makeup","neck","arm","wristsbr","br","guarante","year","old","video","camera","put","togeth","well","movieno","reason","bui","rend","watch","thi","film","except","exampl","make","low","budget","video"],"filtered2":["realli","bad","shoot","video","make","two","three","amateur","video","makersbr","re","go","make","bad","horror","littl","throw","blood","gore","nuditi","blood","provid","latex","cut","arm","prop","bui","halloween","store","lesbian","hooker","nuditi","sex","lesbian","spend","lot","time","bed","onli","talkingbr","seem","edit","effect","fade","wipe","etc","onc","bite","black","appear","separ","scenesbr","terribl","music","bad","heavi","metal","band","whose","websit","take","major","end","creditsth","werewolf","repres","rubber","mask","attach","actor","face","even","bother","appli","brown","makeup","neck","arm","wristsbr","guarante","year","old","video","camera","put","togeth","well","movieno","reason","bui","rend","watch","except","exampl","make","low","budget","video"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,7,8,9,11,13,14,20,24,31,35,41,47,57,67,68,72,83,95,106,117,118,154,159,166,169,217,224,229,231,233,236,240,251,254,256,270,283,303,307,310,347,348,355,358,404,429,496,531,598,612,694,793,927,960,962,991,1065,1158,1177,1239,1340,1349,1790,1949,1955,2004,2055,2142,2165,2313,2353,2472,2538,2625,2831,3484,3753],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,7,8,9,11,13,14,20,24,31,35,41,47,57,67,68,72,83,95,106,117,118,154,159,166,169,217,224,229,231,233,236,240,251,254,256,270,283,303,307,310,347,348,355,358,404,429,496,531,598,612,694,793,927,960,962,991,1065,1158,1177,1239,1340,1349,1790,1949,1955,2004,2055,2142,2165,2313,2353,2472,2538,2625,2831,3484,3753],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,3.205071257016622,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,1.7064694353107215,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,2.0064197866819473,1.9209463754160525,2.292318797740072,2.0323326556775485,2.159084361316692,2.2797301185117202,2.354379525480895,2.348499626138016,2.300267965194495,2.4423870329693536,2.4214486257841834,2.6113665294700725,2.689504733779216,2.8432628718938773,2.7049353070058615,2.6102777977348763,2.617923930016232,11.066428510645427,2.6942272927333892,2.889652074525771,2.748952192422636,2.731603554088023,2.7678802023081546,2.868298950055202,2.8767855639325206,2.854312708080462,6.030397968308703,3.0103169565570433,6.371042091164268,3.2030824725120812,3.1419947805322432,3.2872346624216657,3.293679367864308,3.424750734647968,3.5642670069567886,7.185844525434329,3.6715125373103863,3.770603439954617,4.25

{"value":"Haunted Boat sells itself as 'The Fog' meets 'Open Water'. In many ways this is accurate. There are scares and weird looking people to keep you interested.<br /><br />However the acting ability is poor at best. Showing clear signs that this is merely a bunch of friends making a horror film. Which in all credit they do to the best of their ability. When you accept the low budget makes it very difficult for special effects, with the ghosts looking pretty much like men with rubber masks on.<br /><br />Many aspects of the film are creepy and strange. But it suffers for using too many twists and turns in a short space of time which just leaves you bored and confused. In terms of keeping you awake the film does it very well.

didn't)","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","truli","bore","it","be","ban","in","chines","cinema","and","i","can","see","why","it","not","becaus","it","critic","of","the","communist","regim","but","simpli","becaus","the","movi","be","of","such","low","qualiti","i","would","never","want","to","pai","monei","to","watch","thi","i","love","movi","from","chen","kaig","and","zhang","yimou","and","i","be","disappoint","such","a","poor","movi","can","come","out","of","china","it","total","seem","to","ignor","the","audienc","and","the","director","seem","to","have","make","the","movi","for","himself","the","shot","of","a","person","stand","there","do","noth","for","up","to","a","minut","be","hilari","and","there","plenti","of","them","the","cinematographi","and","video","qualiti","be","unbeliev","bad","i","look","thi","film","up","on","the","net","and","it","seem","like","peopl","actual","like","thi","film","the","onli","explan","i","have","for","thi","be","that","some","film","buff","think","that","if","a","film","be","not","in","english","it","be","automat","good","i","ca","not","see","ani","reason","why","peopl","would","like","thi","thi","be","not","a","art","film","it","of","wast","of","celluloidthat","if","thei","actual","shoot","it","on","film","which","thei","do","not"],"filtered":["thi","movi","truli","bore","ban","chines","cinema","see","becaus","critic","communist","regim","simpli","becaus","movi","low","qualiti","never","want","pai","monei","watch","thi","love","movi","chen","kaig","zhang","yimou","disappoint","poor","movi","come","china","total","seem","ignor","audienc","director","seem","make","movi","shot","person","stand","noth","minut","hilari","plenti","cinematographi","video","qualiti","unbeliev","bad","look","thi","film","net","seem","like","peopl","actual","like","thi","film","onli","explan","thi","film","buff","think","film","english","automat","good","ca","see","ani","reason","peopl","like","thi","thi","art","film","wast","celluloidthat","thei","actual","shoot","film","thei"],"filtered2":["truli","bore","ban","chines","cinema","see","becaus","critic","communist","regim","simpli","becaus","low","qualiti","never","want","pai","monei","watch","love","chen","kaig","zhang","yimou","disappoint","poor","come","china","total","seem","ignor","audienc","director","seem","make","shot","person","stand","noth","minut","hilari","plenti","cinematographi","video","qualiti","unbeliev","bad","look","net","seem","like","peopl","actual","like","onli","explan","buff","think","english","automat","good","ca","see","ani","reason","peopl","like","art","wast","celluloidthat","actual","shoot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,9,11,12,16,22,23,27,34,35,37,42,49,52,54,58,59,81,89,95,108,117,126,146,153,168,184,187,201,217,240,319,322,343,377,382,409,441,571,579,588,629,632,763,887,1000,1671,2262,2319,2331,2880,3645,4911,5093,5711],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,9,11,12,16,22,23,27,34,35,37,42,49,52,54,58,59,81,89,95,108,117,126,146,153,168,184,187,201,217,240,319,322,343,377,382,409,441,571,579,588,629,632,763,887,1000,1671,2262,2319,2331,2880,3645,4911,5093,5711],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9381148836729736,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,2.5958480334723544,2.729695454751562,1.3002700588679295,1.3982850089458962,4.389507038697402,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,1.6920303308087352,3.4244306149452273,1.8113893252729412,1.865701314626681,1.8693254449200722,1.949757232424728,1.9940046109572438,2.0323326556775485,2.138507503627933,2.2797301185117202,2.2391270689902285,2.326138445979858,2.3409902041158843,2.4894767118610357,2.496249838866882,2.4732161909892554,2.561435818751577,2.6113665294700725,2.7666071276613566,5.811212004936025,2.885344817328191,2.9705344631698933,3.0602441305135506,3.235085203598255,3.2209578243390444,3.293679367864308,3.467417180966871,3.5642670069567886,3.6375061693251913,3.488143311483988,3.541919708264792,3.7465885637507435,3.9323057095458362,4.062925891962901,5.129498826886393,5.064116067623542,5.274680836730892,5.089758498236879,5.501738287366237,5.7959777603641776,6.137727054086234,6.600350576034347,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.076406393390356E-5,7.028688530750959E-5,7.083329881877606E-5,7.042402326358877E-5,7.042517708192134E-5,7.032673675800027E-5,7.053589832680628E-5,0.042083945175225006,7.045505945587084E-5,0.07553723695206918,0.7992536721534192,7.018353129300592E-5,7.149347210078205E-5,7.251334218999134E-5,7.023470839187721E-5,7.004060996130538E-5,7.178768536317588E-5,7.05425070080522E-5,7.032364915486192E-5,7.038193495667938E-5,7.106292145722007E-5,7.061239678189

{"value":"First off, the movie was not true to facts at all. I just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it. First of all Nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. Also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. In my opinion Russell Crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent/individualist type, therefore he really couldn't play one. It would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to Pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife. At this level ABM was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great.

{"value":"It is considered fashion to highlight every social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance, however moronic this illogical 'logic' may be. However within the story and theme of the film, there is no grey area and the woman who should be called the film's antagonist, is the ''villain of the story''. Under no circumstances can what she did be justified. Sexuality of women is just hype in this case and has nothing to do with the actuality. It is betrayal of the ultimate sort. The man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another man's offspring. To top it all, the most feeble of arguments raised by the 3 'liberated' female characters in the climax is pathetic. A woman's sexual needs are no excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse, there are no other children. So in essence his life has been wasted.

{"value":"There is a remark that one of heroines was raped on \"drunken rampage\" by Russian soldiers, which is completely untrue. This movie should not be shown only because of this.<br /><br />Also there is a statement by someone, that KGB prosecuted \"Jews, Gypsies etc\", which is \"worse than Nazis\". KGB was looking for so called \"zionist\" agents, who were (KGB believed) imperialist agents. This is totally different from targeting Jewry as a whole nation, as Nazis did. Gypsies were never prosecuted. KGB was political tool and used politically, but from internationalist standpoint. Communists really did not distinguish between nationalities.<br /><br />Whole movie stinks like fake. Main hero does not speak Russian, signs in Berlin contains typographical errors, KGB general looks totally phony. Some so called \"russian proverbs\" are totally made up, and list goes on and on.<br /><br />Not recommended to watch - this movie is full of lies, and phony stuff.

{"value":"This insipid mini operetta featuring a Eddy-McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes. It's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers. In under a minute he is packed off to Morrocco where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe that would rather sing than fight.<br /><br />Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare possess fine light opera voices (with little acting ability) and there's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along.<br /><br />This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers.

{"value":"This insipid mini operetta featuring a Eddy-McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes. It's silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers. In under a minute he is packed off to Morrocco where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow; the leader of an Arab tribe that would rather sing than fight.<br /><br />Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare possess fine light opera voices (with little acting ability) and there's a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along.<br /><br />This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers.

{"value":"Another chapter in the ongoing question, whatever happened to Mel Brooks's sense of humor? It starts out nicely enough, with Mel as Trump-like mogul Goddard Bolt (\"You can call me God\"), who accepts a bet that he can't live on the streets for 30 days. But the moment the movie hits the streets, it turns into a pathos-laden mess, with occasional \"funny\" bits interjected (Mel sees a black kid break-dancing for money and tries to do a vaudeville buck-and-wing, yuk, yuk). Leslie Ann Warren is nothing short of wasted. The worst part is this movie's musical number, in which Brooks and Warren do a silent dance to Cole Porter's \"Easy to Love.\" Brooks's musical parodies are usually the highlights of his movies; here he plays the whole thing straight, like a dancing excerpt from an aging guest star on \"The Carol Burnett Show\" (on which Rudy DeLuca, this film's co-writer, began his career).

{"value":"This movie is trash-poor. It has horrible taste, and is pedestrian and unconvincing in script although supposedly based on real-events - which doesn't add much of anything but make it more of a disappointment. Direction is not well done at as scenes and dialogue are out-of-place. Not sure what Robin Williams saw in this character or story. To start, Williams is not convincing as a gay in a relationship breakup nor is the relationship itself interesting. What's worse, his character is compelled by an ugly pedophile story that is base and has no place as a plot device. You have an older Rory Culkin tastelessly spouting \"d_ck_smker\" - in good fun- which is annoying enough and then laughed up by the Williams character. Finally you have Sandra Oh as a guardian angel adviser to Williams and a thrown in explanation of the whole fiasco towards the end. Toni Collete's character is just plain annoying and a re-hash of her 6th Sense performance with poorer direction.

{"value":"An archaeologist (Casper Van Dien) stumbles accidentally upon an ancient, 40 foot mummy, well preserved underground in the Nevada desert. They are determined to keep this a secret and call in a Jewish translator to assist in figuring out the history of it. The mummy, as explained at the beginning, is the son of a fallen angel and is one of several giants that apparently existed in \"those days\". In order to save his son from a devastating flood which was predicted to kill everything, he mummifies his son, burying him with several servants for centuries - planning to awaken him years from then. In our present, the fallen angels still walk the earth and the mummy is resurrected and a ritual is expected to take place. Most of the movie is slow, having to do with a lot of biblical crap and a couple lousy, air-punching fights. The mummy is decent looking but isn't shown nearly enough. It should have had more to do with that but it dragged on a great deal so... eh.

{"value":"My commentary has nothing to do with the political sentiments found in the film. In fact, they're quite congruent with mine. What gets me is the fact that in terms of a movie, it is stupid and devoid of any semblance of story, motive or dialogue. Maybe someone should tell Neal that substituting lyrics of songs which are failing to inspire anyone outside of a dwindling audience isn't the same thing as creating characters who are motivated to speak because of events created by the writer or director. A silly narrative remains as such despite the iconic legacy of Neal Young. The most childish scene is the one where the devil dances his way into a bar, slips a tonic to an unsuspecting hero, who then finds his way onto the dance floor to mouth the words to Young song to the heroine, who is unaware of what's taken place. Somehow these two dream up a scheme where they will go up the West Coast in search of?????

Also, what was treated as a \"curse\" looked more like a coincidence. Who cursed the family? Why? When? Finally, why didn't he just plan on staying in his apartment all day on his birthday? Those are my criticisms, but I did love the shots of Seattle, cinematography was beautiful, acting was good in the times it wasn't outstanding.","finished_norm":["honestli","i","be","disappoint","in","expir","date","super","clever","titl","and","interest","premis","but","i","do","not","think","it","deliv","what","be","it","about","the","main","charact","desir","to","reconnect","with","hi","nativ","root","or","much","like","it","be","hi","ne","to","overcom","hi","fear","of","death","but","he","be","not","set","up","a","someon","who","have","live","hi","life","in","fear","it","seem","a","if","hi","life","be","go","fine","but","sinc","doomsdai","be","approach","he","should","now","start","worri","i","do","not","bui","it","meanwhil","the","support","charact","in","the","film","do","not","seem","to","have","ne","that","blend","into","a","overarch","stori","thei","be","all","just","do","their","thing","run","parallel","to","the","main","charact","conjur","what","be","treat","a","a","curs","look","much","like","a","coincid","who","curs","the","famili","why","when","final","why","do","not","he","just","plan","on","stai","in","hi","apart","all","dai","on","hi","birthdai","that","be","my","critic","but","i","do","love","the","shot","of","seattl","cinematographi","be","beauti","act","be","good","in","the","time","it","be","not","outstand"],"filtered":["honestli","disappoint","expir","date","super","clever","titl","interest","premis","think","deliv","main","charact","desir","reconnect","hi","nativ","root","much","like","hi","ne","overcom","hi","fear","death","set","someon","live","hi","life","fear","seem","hi","life","go","fine","sinc","doomsdai","approach","start","worri","bui","meanwhil","support","charact","film","seem","ne","blend","overarch","stori","thei","thing","run","parallel","main","charact","conjur","treat","curs","look","much","like","coincid","curs","famili","final","plan","stai","hi","apart","dai","hi","birthdai","critic","love","shot","seattl","cinematographi","beauti","act","good","time","outstand"],"filtered2":["honestli","disappoint","expir","date","super","clever","titl","interest","premis","think","deliv","main","charact","desir","reconnect","nativ","root","like","ne","overcom","fear","death","set","someon","live","life","fear","seem","life","go","fine","sinc","doomsdai","approach","start","worri","bui","meanwhil","support","charact","seem","ne","blend","overarch","stori","thing","run","parallel","main","charact","conjur","treat","curs","look","like","coincid","curs","famili","final","plan","stai","apart","dai","birthdai","critic","love","shot","seattl","cinematographi","beauti","act","good","time","outstand"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,10,12,16,17,21,29,35,39,54,60,71,75,109,110,116,132,137,139,156,162,179,182,187,245,264,325,347,365,441,458,464,484,517,572,579,581,629,647,757,812,849,955,1079,1182,1342,1362,1364,1402,1566,1727,2412,2605,2804,2848,3129,3344,5870],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,10,12,16,17,21,29,35,39,54,60,71,75,109,110,116,132,137,139,156,162,179,182,187,245,264,325,347,365,441,458,464,484,517,572,579,581,629,647,757,812,849,955,1079,1182,1342,1362,1364,1402,1566,1727,2412,2605,2804,2848,3129,3344,5870],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,3.3716610723085094,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3195384777338066,2.926338025798268,1.5538940054862738,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,1.9214926742550966,3.948450049740535,2.125691139326857,4.2580959472608155,2.2466628996789315,2.253494045787767,2.2939035841256437,2.2939035841256437,2.3451551414151686,2.3586007221245198,5.01593744596019,2.7365296724240786,2.4732161909892554,2.7502029743242886,2.757740698455715,2.973659465713028,3.0151989841543516,3.008694896185175,3.293679367864308,3.2850956241729166,3.2872346624216657,3.291526514503207,3.4198487640477615,3.4933926673701317,3.5642670069567886,3.530930586689197,3.488143311483988,3.6746621462132825,3.7165362186843414,7.905849993497144,3.880604335168946,4.017463517886143,4.186539847930077,4.327618446189983,4.484804029712395,4.396611317676934,4.724033718778229,4.436351646326448,9.48443207572284,4.760735085628657,5.116075806554253,5.1994574154933035,5.3064295350454715,5.5623629091826725,5.482320201509136,5.541743621979936,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.986088908263474E-5,5.9457233113217074E-5,5.991945640527852E-5,5.957324114782548E-5,5.95742171883097E-5,5.9490944337883784E-5,5.966787874179734E-5,5.946579456628018E-5,5.959949535031842E-5,6.612238668291772E-5,0.8517493505417546,5.936980366309069E-5,6.047791160715036E-5,6.134064230540247E-5,5.941309550458198E-5,5.924890334294432E-5,6.0726793122537136E-5,0.03418851372125993,5.948833246599965E-5,5.953763771676855E-5,6.011369928120489E-5,5.973259047936942E

{"value":"I should have listened. I was warned, and still, I paid money for this, after reading all the reviews, after knowing the original is \"so bad it's good\", and that part 2 does not fit into that category at all, still, even then, I couldn't resist. Exactly what happened here? Part one was Hilarious, it had so much politically incorrectness, and other Crazy, Fat Entertainment, and this one, there just couldn't possibly be a worse sequel on God's green earth, not Basket Case 2, hell, not even Troll 2. This is truly the worst sequel in history and that's really saying something considering the groundbreaking, bottom of the barrel qualities of the original. Criminally Insane part 2 was just a completely different brand of bad. Shot on Video, zero score, zero entertainment value, 1/3 consists of flashbacks of the original, and on top of all that, crazy, fat Ethel has lost a portion of her girth. I mean, honestly, is this some kind of sick joke?!?

{"value":"I've heard about this movie for many years, and finally got a chance to see it. A massive murdering of cheerleaders back in 1963 and 1969 eventually cause a cheerleading camp to close up. Fast forward to 1982, and Bambi, a former student, opens it back up with new recruits, among them Candy (Carol Kane), Glenn (Judge Reinhold), and Sandy (Debralee Scott). One by one, they are murdered by the killer, until only one remains. It is then when we find out who did it and why.<br /><br />Also in the movie are Tom Smothers doing a terrible accent as a Canadian Mountie, and Paul Reubens doing his Pee-Wee Herman schtick. The plot overall isn't very well developed, and quite lame, but some funny scenes do occur, namely the House of Bad Pies and the strip poker scene. The ending seems like it's thrown together, which is a shame.<br /><br />Overall, good for about ten or fifteen minutes total, the rest you can just fast forward through.

has absolutely no shame,, dumb jocks,, i could'nt personally wait for the rat to eat these drunken fools,, i was rooting for the rat the e ntire time,, it had a good premise,, the first part of the

{"value":"Checking the spoiler alert just in case.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most horrendous movies I have ever seen, Mazes and Monsters felt like I wasted 101 minutes of my life. The only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious, but just ended up being funny since they were so bad. Evil Dead anyone? Unfortunately for M&M (fortunately for us) it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy. This movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) encountered throughout the film. It ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the D&D is the Devil movement in the 80s.<br /><br />If you want to avoid wasting your time and money, steer clear of this junk.<br /><br />P.S. - Even though the cover looks kinda interesting, which is why I guess my brother bought it, it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm, unless you consider New England or New

{"value":"Revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since, in fact, most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events. Unfortunately, what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom. One cares not who wins, loses, dies or lives--just end it as soon as possible. This is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology. Scenes of Paris and the French countryside have a cardboard quality about them. They might better be done on a bare stage and left that way. One cannot expect the amazing effects of \"The House of the Flying Daggers\" or \"The Golden Compass,\" but , after all, this is a 2002 digitally mastered production. Characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene, so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms. In my view, this film turns the French Revolution of the 1790s into the \"papier-mache\" revolution of a \"papier colle\" world.","finished_norm":["revolut","alwai","present","opportun","for","dramat","film","sinc","in","fact","much","revolut","be","in","themselv","dramat","event","unfortun","what","thi","film","lack","in","drama","be","compens","for","by","a","overabund","of","boredom","on","care","not","who","win","lose","die","or","livesjust","end","it","a","soon","a","possibl","thi","be","due","in","larg","measur","to","what","seem","to","me","to","be","a","superfici","us","of","background","technologi","scene","of","pari","and","the","french","countrysid","have","a","cardboard","qualiti","about","them","thei","mai","well","be","do","on","a","bare","stage","and","leav","that","wai","on","cannot","expect","the","amaz","effect","of","the","hous","of","the","fly","dagger","or","the","golden","compass","but","after","all","thi","be","a","digit","master","product","charact","seem","to","enter","a","scene","for","the","sake","of","enter","a","scene","so","much","so","that","on","lose","count","of","the","numb","of","time","charact","enter","and","leav","room","in","my","view","thi","film","turn","the","french","revolut","of","the","into","the","papiermach","revolut","of","a","papier","coll","world"],"filtered":["revolut","alwai","present","opportun","dramat","film","sinc","fact","much","revolut","themselv","dramat","event","unfortun","thi","film","lack","drama","compens","overabund","boredom","care","win","lose","die","livesjust","end","soon","possibl","thi","due","larg","measur","seem","superfici","us","background","technologi","scene","pari","french","countrysid","cardboard","qualiti","thei","mai","well","bare","stage","leav","wai","expect","amaz","effect","hous","fly","dagger","golden","compass","thi","digit","master","product","charact","seem","enter","scene","sake","enter","scene","much","lose","count","numb","time","charact","enter","leav","room","view","thi","film","turn","french","revolut","papiermach","revolut","papier","coll","world"],"filtered2":["revolut","alwai","present","opportun","dramat","sinc","fact","revolut","themselv","dramat","event","unfortun","lack","drama","compens","overabund","boredom","care","win","lose","die","livesjust","end","soon","possibl","due","larg","measur","seem","superfici","us","background","technologi","scene","pari","french","countrysid","cardboard","qualiti","mai","well","bare","stage","leav","wai","expect","amaz","effect","hous","fly","dagger","golden","compass","digit","master","product","charact","seem","enter","scene","sake","enter","scene","lose","count","numb","time","charact","enter","leav","room","view","turn","french","revolut","papiermach","revolut","papier","coll","world"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,10,19,20,24,33,35,46,56,74,96,97,106,130,162,165,183,190,197,205,213,221,227,293,312,319,402,411,436,449,463,470,489,513,516,564,568,589,652,669,685,756,801,884,899,993,1059,1170,1270,1766,1814,1828,1894,2266,2420,2444,2459,2465,3170,4012,4468,6731],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,10,19,20,24,33,35,46,56,74,96,97,106,130,162,165,183,190,197,205,213,221,227,293,312,319,402,411,436,449,463,470,489,513,516,564,568,589,652,669,685,756,801,884,899,993,1059,1170,1270,1766,1814,1828,1894,2266,2420,2444,2459,2465,3170,4012,4468,6731],"values":[0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,3.9371420340352055,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,1.4018535447685214,2.926338025798268,1.655771293751733,1.8610609350701788,3.8972672736018033,2.0390708128715254,2.0545557924622586,2.159084361316692,2.2642139034199635,2.3586007221245198,2.448847599972298,2.4885128563647294,2.558331832813986,2.558331832813986,2.571852579609833,2.8432628718938773,5.284684914728755,2.6005321873043625,2.9012296278682137,2.8824835850471584,2.9056060024680126,3.084424928710765,3.229006157521873,3.2070272508030975,3.2597778161886266,3.3467891931782563,3.3814747511661465,3.3956930001684253,3.454678155189441,3.442099372982581,3.469984576472117,3.4471119148061256,3.496027715008137,3.7810747398219124,3.7099788181381825,3.607563812710113,7.527365994220087,3.7881170224473255,3.9323057095458362,8.394243914521228,4.026392148630444,4.224077767249142,12.858208329831331,4.3521595551061,4.715065048795469,4.869215728622727,4.944927550358424,5.1994574154933035,5.089758498236879,5.2288713006995975,5.116075806554253,5.102830579804232,21.853088026153767,5.482320201509136,5.850044981634453,6.032366538428407,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.905374956409179E-5,4.872296866295063E-5,4.910174328455995E-5,4.8818032888763374E-5,4.8818832717269284E-5,4.875059374499739E-5,4.889558484138532E-5,4.8729984452072684E-5,4.883954722130721E-5,0.3556799320498163,0.5164850925894493,4.865132351339221E-5,4.95593763407207E-5,5.026635173420161E-5,4.868

{"value":"This 1919 to 1933 Germany looks hardly like a post WWII Czech capitol. Oh sorry, it is the Czech capitol and it is 2003, how funny.<br /><br />This is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past. Röhm is a head higher than Adolf and looks so damned good, Göring looks like 40 when he just is 23 and the \"Führer\" always seems to look like 56. And the buildings, folks, even buildings have been young, sometimes. Especially 1919 were a lot of houses in Germany nearly new (the WWI does not reach German cities!). No crumbling plaster! Then the Reichstagsbuilding. There have never been urban canyons around this building, never. And this may sound to you all like a miracle: in the year 1933 the Greater Berlin fire brigade owns a lot of vehicles with engines, some even with turntable ladders, but none with a hand pump.<br /><br />One last thing: What kind of PLAYMOBIL castle was this at the final sequence?

{"value":"I just loved watching it though and having fun with it's total badness of a film. I saw this film through the helpful sarcasm of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I have the DVD. If you flip the to the other side of the DVD, they show the actual movie, so I gave it a chance. Seriously, folks this is grilled cheese.<br /><br />The acting, special effects, and plot in general is very cheesy and unrealistic. \"Doesn't she need lungs\" said Crow noticing how the head can still talk while it doesn't have a body, and Tom Servo just wistfully remarks \"No, she's got neck juice!\". The ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with K-Porn! I loved the \"cat fight\" between the two strippers. That \"Meow\" after the fight or scene, whatever, was classic. So, in some ways this was a fun movie. I think for horror fans, you'll probably enjoy it.

{"value":"(Very light spoilers, maybe.) <br /><br />Normally a fan of Diane Keaton, I tried to watch this tonight. I had to switch it off before the second hour because I found myself with absolutely no sympathy for daughter or mother. Both came across as self-absorbed with little regard for others, with the daughter also adding in rude, disrespectful and reckless to the mix. When the daughter died, the only thing I thought was, \"At least we won't have to watch her anymore.\" Keaton did a good job of moving into her stunned state and into the grieving, but it was too far gone for me by then. I simply wasn't enjoying it, so I stopped watching. If you want me to care for the protagonist, you need to get me caring about the characters much sooner--if it's nearly an hour in and I don't care, it's too late.<br /><br />The supporting cast was

{"value":"The past creeps up on a rehab-addict when he reconnects with his ill brother and a former girlfriend after what he hopes was his last stint in detox. \"Life's dramas\", presented here in the most simplistic way imaginable (not even the writing has any bite or wit). The cast is made up of attractive looking actors smiling glumly at one another, and the music and photography are lugubrious (a couple of the visual effects are laughable, indie-cliché touches that reek of a puny budget). Although written and directed by a man, this was produced by a woman, and I'm not sure but I think this may be a distinct reason why this picture about two men, estranged brothers growing closer, never quite gels, never feels natural or seems lived in. It's an attempt to get inside a male relationship, but the careful, sterile presentation is a cheat.

{"value":"I was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that I went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated 12A here in the UK. To my dismay, this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (Which is not a problem to me as an adult, but not good for watching with children). This film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes, getting hit in the groin etc... and for the most part of the film not very funny.<br /><br />The premise of the film is that Calvin Sims who is a 2inch midget, gets out of jail and steals a giant sized diamond but is then forced to put it in a womens handbag. So the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby, getting into this womens house so he can get this diamond back.<br /><br />Up until now, I have enjoyed most of the output

{"value":"A family moves into a old house in Japan. But there's a catch it's haunted (BOO!!!). Aw, didn't mean to make you jump. It's only a review. Settle back down. Ahem, now anyways it's haunted by an old samurai who killed his wife & her lover in slow motion. This naturally makes a 3 minutes scene stretch out to about 7 or 8. Horrid acting. Horrid story. But How bad can it be you ask? Well it was SO bad my brain started to melt & leak out through my nose in thoughtful drips. It was SO bad whenever Doug McClure came on-screen I prayed that i had flashbacks of Small Wonder (Yes, i know Doug was in \"Out of this world\" & not \"small Wonder\", but it's pretty much the same damn show, & i can hum the \"small wonder\" theme better) There are movies that are so bad they're good. this isn't one of those<br /><br />Where i saw it: Showtime Beyond<br /><br />My Grade: F-<br

{"value":"Richard Dreyfuss is, indeed, in this flick, but in a rather small part. He is NOT the \"obsessed\" filmmaker - he's the group's business manager/accountant. Even the box describes the film inaccurately. There are no erotic scenes with Sondra Locke, as advertised, unless one uses the term \"erotic\" quite loosely. I would not have considered viewing the film without Richard Dreyfuss being in it as a major character. I might have, however, had I realized that the famous 60's anthem, Leonard Cohen's \"Suzanne,\" was an artistic influence. Other than the brief recitation of lines from the end of James Joyce's \"Ulysses\", and an interesting visual reference to the end of Ingmar Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal,\" I found it a poor attempt to meld symbolic elements and moods immortalized in films like \"Last Year at Marianbad\" and \"Un Chien Andalou.\" If you like the idea of the eccentric artistic troupe, there are many superior films, ranging from \"Bye, Bye, Brasil\" to \"Cecil B.

{"value":"Another violent, angry fantasy from Paul Verhoeven. Verhoeven is a puzzle: it's difficult to tell whether he takes his sordid impulses seriously, with sardonic intent or operates in complete oblivion. He also seems completely ignorant of the fact that all the brilliant visuals in the world (and this has some outstanding ones) cannot hide a negligence to story, dialogue and performance. Kevin Bacon plays a corrupt scientist who has discovered invisibility and uses it to drive himself into moral bankruptcy. Bacon is normally a likable actor who occasionally shows his dark side (`The River Wild') in an attempt to offset his boyish looks; given the material, however, Bacon isn't nearly hateful enough to compel. The other principals are Elisabeth Shue and Josh Brolin, neither of whom are gifted enough to make a solid impression and who, when forced to deliver inane dialogue, embarrass themselves.

{"value":"This movie lost me with the crossbow RPG (rocket-propelled grenade). It was like someone cut and pasted a scene from Robocop. I half expected Beowulf to say exclaim, \"I LIKE IT!\"<br /><br />I watched this because I like Chris Bruno from \"The Dead Zone\" TV show and he did his part. He chose a strange accent, but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie -- unlike any of his costars. They kept slipping into all kinds of speech from old English to modern English, sometimes in the same sentence.<br /><br />There are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material. However, even on its own, this movie's plot is not good. It's just boring, which even the low budget doesn't excuse. Having a low budget means that you need to at least have a good story, dialog and decent acting. Those things don't cost much. Instead, they spent their money on half-assed CGI and some decent costumes and sets.<br /><br />Life is too short to watch this

{"value":"Stewart Moss stars as a scientist who is on a working trip with his wife, and one gets the feeling that he was picked for this role for his ability to roll his eyes back in his head...imagine the auditions for this..\"can you...no, that's not quite it, thank you, next!\". Anyway, he's bitten by a bat, and then, he's either changing into some kind of bat creature and killing people or....he's not. For no one else sees his strange transformations, but he himself seems to think that he's changing because his wedding ring pops off when his hands turn into claws, etc. To its credit the movie does kind of hold back on whether he's just nuts or whether he's actually transforming into something until almost the very end. This has some good locations & sort of a decent atmosphere at times but unfortunately none of that can make up for the somewhat lame story and the wonderfully bad acting.

{"value":"I grew up on Scooby Doo Where Are You, and I still love it. It is one of my favourite cartoons along with Darkwing Duck, Talespin, Peter Pan and the Pirates and Tom and Jerry. This show though is good for kids, the voices are good(Don Messick and Casey Kasem are perfect as Scooby and Shaggy), the theme tune is tolerable and it has some nice animation. However it is rather disappointing. I normally don't mind Scrappy, but when he appears to be like the main character, it gets annoying fast. Complete with the catchphrase Puppy Power, Scrappy is somewhat more annoying than usual. Also half the gang are missing after the first year, somehow it didn't feel like Scooby Doo. And the jokes and the story lines were in general lame and unoriginal, very little chasing monsters or unmasking the baddies. All in all, not as bad as Shaggy and Scooby Doo:Get a Clue, but this show is disappointing. 4/10 for the animation, voices, theme tune and the fact it is nice for kids.
