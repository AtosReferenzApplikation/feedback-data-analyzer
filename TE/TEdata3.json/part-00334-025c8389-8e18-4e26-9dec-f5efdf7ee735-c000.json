{"value":"I went to a screening of this movie and while it had a couple moments that made me laugh, it had some very major flaws. It first of all presents itself to be the humorous exploits of a real-life divorcee trying to find love in LA. What it morphs into is a depressing, narcissistic, and unfunny romp through the history of the film director's love life and professional life. Jokes wear thin quickly and you find yourself suddenly not caring how this man's dates progress. The ridiculousness is that the director simultaneously presents himself as an extremely annoying and heavily flawed character and then expects us to be concerned.","finished_norm":["i","go","to","a","screen","of","thi","movi","and","while","it","have","a","coupl","moment","that","make","me","laugh","it","have","some","veri","major","flaw","it","of","all","present","itself","to","be","the","humor","exploit","of","a","reallif","divorce","try","to","find","love","in","la","what","it","morph","into","be","a","depress","narcissist","and","unfunni","romp","through","the","histori","of","the","film","director","love","life","and","profession","life","joke","wear","thin","quickli","and","you","find","yourself","suddenli","not","care","how","thi","man","date","progress","the","ridicul","be","that","the","director","simultan","present","himself","a","a","extrem","annoi","and","heavili","flaw","charact","and","then","expect","u","to","be","concern"],"filtered":["go","screen","thi","movi","coupl","moment","make","laugh","veri","major","flaw","present","humor","exploit","reallif","divorce","try","find","love","la","morph","depress","narcissist","unfunni","romp","histori","film","director","love","life","profession","life","joke","wear","thin","quickli","find","suddenli","care","thi","man","date","progress","ridicul","director","simultan","present","extrem","annoi","heavili","flaw","charact","expect","u","concern"],"filtered2":["go","screen","coupl","moment","make","laugh","veri","major","flaw","present","humor","exploit","reallif","divorce","try","find","love","la","morph","depress","narcissist","unfunni","romp","histori","director","love","life","profession","life","joke","wear","thin","quickli","find","suddenli","care","man","date","progress","ridicul","director","simultan","present","extrem","annoi","heavili","flaw","charact","expect","u","concern"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,10,15,36,38,45,54,58,75,112,130,133,188,192,205,214,253,271,274,329,369,404,411,499,514,647,766,770,785,874,918,923,948,980,1075,1160,1504,2098,3268,4075,4490,4596,5859],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,10,15,36,38,45,54,58,75,112,130,133,188,192,205,214,253,271,274,329,369,404,411,499,514,647,766,770,785,874,918,923,948,980,1075,1160,1504,2098,3268,4075,4490,4596,5859],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,1.4680183469605717,3.038623282696244,1.8162961064622165,3.6227786505458823,3.731402629253362,3.948450049740535,2.2466628996789315,2.2642139034199635,2.3212364753796515,2.5378812223426954,2.5318267134339894,2.571852579609833,2.7303758068497004,2.7073305177318163,2.757740698455715,2.748952192422636,2.951986790814132,3.121829110937649,3.1419947805322432,6.458012315043746,3.3814747511661465,3.405285399859865,3.6746621462132825,3.9825254665248626,3.7264536553416874,3.7952092507568174,3.872882289075035,4.039936373738201,7.982292419137539,4.049068857301474,4.081705786614497,4.202455303235976,4.2574141875167335,4.566029469634981,4.944927550358424,5.649374286172302,5.822646007446338,5.967828017290836,6.101359409915359,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006096E-4,2.4075667160687833E-4,2.4081611628889958E-4,2.407677045465102E-4,2.4079049035382493E-4,2.407553441472231E-4,2.408302224017345E-4,2.4071952367870074E-4,2.4075672248833965E-4,2.4100551847254214E-4,2.4291782711448516E-4,2.4075712015618722E-4,2.4098513236326822E-4,2.4101023885640517E-4,2.409007541978268E-4,2.407686528956509E-4,2.4085148662392355E-4,2.409648321523585E-4,2.4078108274308002E-4,2.40780202423552E-4,2.4099682081796475E-4,2.408043261416534E-4,2.4080469057813226E-4,2.4095895264117194E-4,2.4078116959887945E-4,2.4101311952363057E-4,2.4084142415433356E-4,2.4075613202122128E-4,2.4086528056278402E-4,2.409387961184072E-4,2.4080550732584645E-4,2.409344775116556E-4,2.4105277032522793E-4,2.412765046734123E-4,2.4084100797358164E-4,2.4076850686564617E-4,2.4085531750952737E-4,2.407929591559198E-4,2.407197806021709E-4,2.4078100817709696E-4,2.410223118943288E-4,2.4089009598459967E-4,2.4093502655981778E-4,2.4073176119878195E-4,2.4078106940160772E-4,2.4076841632749481E-4,2.4084991425345312E-4,2.408916779296221E-4,2.408426939681423E-4,2.4080451997563967E-4,2.4076901172928757E-4,2.412623083340394E-4,2.4082959614816173E-4,2.407810142148923E-4,2.4082830641647616E-4,2.4075637834747315E-4,0.9809713522425287,2.4079394036305172E-4,2.4076934973816367E-4,2.4075624091759266E-4,2.4094885168561992E-4,2.408521287765039E-4,2.4075614027516243E-4,2.4073166311921887E-4,2.4070745489132762E-4,2.4092509253415947E-4,2.4076793474448412E-4,2.408773788924867E-4,2.4094807029668825E-4,2.4083875684592366E-4,2.4078133312136933E-4,2.4073197870238768E-4,2.407935623903713E-4,2.4073184904116243E-4,2.4074448225927753E-4,2.4073198551570268E-4,2.4088825421425398E-4,2.4081655816085971E-4,2.4075646162263976E-4,2.4077978339942256E-4]}}
{"value":"This is by far the WORST movie I have ever seen. I was going in expecting a cheesy movie but at least with some cool car scenes/races. What I got was nothing. The racing scene are so low budget they sped them up to make it look like the cars are \"going fast\" In one scene a Mercedes SLR goes from over 200 to 0 in like 4 seconds by just spinning around in circles. Its just ridiculous.<br /><br />If you wanna see a real movie about cars, see the fast and the furious series. They may be a little cheesy, but 100x better than this movie could ever hope to be. Better yet just watch Mischief 3000, the best car movie ever made I think.","finished_norm":["thi","be","by","far","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","i","be","go","in","expect","a","cheesi","movi","but","at","littl","with","some","cool","car","scenesrac","what","i","get","be","noth","the","race","scene","be","so","low","budget","thei","spe","them","up","to","make","it","look","like","the","car","be","go","fast","in","on","scene","a","merced","slr","go","from","over","to","in","like","second","by","just","spin","around","in","circl","it","just","ridiculousbr","br","if","you","wanna","see","a","real","movi","about","car","see","the","fast","and","the","furiou","seri","thei","mai","be","a","littl","cheesi","but","x","well","than","thi","movi","can","ever","hope","to","be","well","yet","just","watch","mischief","the","well","car","movi","ever","make","i","think"],"filtered":["thi","far","wrong","movi","ever","see","go","expect","cheesi","movi","littl","cool","car","scenesrac","get","noth","race","scene","low","budget","thei","spe","make","look","like","car","go","fast","scene","merced","slr","go","like","second","spin","around","circl","ridiculousbr","br","wanna","see","real","movi","car","see","fast","furiou","seri","thei","mai","littl","cheesi","x","well","thi","movi","ever","hope","well","yet","watch","mischief","well","car","movi","ever","make","think"],"filtered2":["far","wrong","ever","see","go","expect","cheesi","littl","cool","car","scenesrac","get","noth","race","scene","low","budget","spe","make","look","like","car","go","fast","scene","merced","slr","go","like","second","spin","around","circl","ridiculousbr","wanna","see","real","car","see","fast","furiou","mai","littl","cheesi","x","well","ever","hope","well","yet","watch","mischief","well","car","ever","make","think"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,12,14,16,19,20,25,44,46,49,80,98,101,130,181,194,217,256,284,481,542,543,947,1123,1429,1808,2001,2017,2268,4363,5308],"values":[2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,12,14,16,19,20,25,44,46,49,80,98,101,130,181,194,217,256,284,481,542,543,947,1123,1429,1808,2001,2017,2268,4363,5308],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.2920765891153156,1.967100616408184,0.7966340470719924,2.912480743411154,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,2.2350163994518417,1.1966138720291084,2.62476135602347,3.4960351200691706,1.2796387880827016,4.814188177507422,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,1.9951803900462557,2.0881990796736947,2.098582041218749,2.2642139034199635,2.4442286541160034,2.5378812223426954,2.6113665294700725,2.748952192422636,12.443994720653116,3.353630724994973,6.894223829612251,6.955453101251464,3.9911462095687695,4.390138803171316,4.535724120139652,4.770124825978496,5.064116067623542,5.00274712124725,5.143104478942172,6.032366538428407,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255726E-4,2.2737792632708287E-4,2.2743406769354615E-4,2.273883461709777E-4,2.274098657807245E-4,2.2737667263379298E-4,2.2744738993572342E-4,2.2734284269338752E-4,2.2737797438108313E-4,2.2761294487884298E-4,2.294189873473664E-4,2.273783499506985E-4,2.2759369161694313E-4,2.2761740295299343E-4,2.2751400231007032E-4,2.2738924182076224E-4,2.2746747251417923E-4,2.2757451948007213E-4,2.2740098094688543E-4,2.2740014954633712E-4,2.2760473054921085E-4,2.274229327197403E-4,2.2742327690463988E-4,2.275689666908078E-4,2.2740106297614525E-4,2.2762012354277306E-4,2.2745796921172108E-4,2.2737741672597002E-4,2.2748049992975632E-4,2.27549930257393E-4,2.274240482660329E-4,2.2754585163377167E-4,2.2765757096628261E-4,2.2786887249242008E-4,2.2745757615795555E-4,2.2738910390558242E-4,2.2747109051910835E-4,2.2741219739254274E-4,2.273430853397303E-4,2.2740091052450215E-4,2.2762880509736278E-4,2.2750393636919414E-4,2.275463701715623E-4,2.273544001797113E-4,2.2740096834679302E-4,2.273890183985974E-4,2.2746598751966342E-4,2.2750543040620823E-4,2.274591684625195E-4,2.2742311578245484E-4,2.2738958071416717E-4,2.2785546503755494E-4,2.2744679848279387E-4,2.274009162267798E-4,2.274455804209465E-4,2.2737764936397743E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441395E-4,2.2738989994003456E-4,2.2737751957101662E-4,2.2755942704103606E-4,2.274680789826153E-4,2.2737742452124318E-4,2.2735430755038756E-4,2.273314445633674E-4,2.2753698817546146E-4,2.2738856357694867E-4,2.2749192596045138E-4,2.2755868907355315E-4,2.2745545012449881E-4,2.2740121741176027E-4,2.2735460559673466E-4,2.2741276710551374E-4,2.2735448314072822E-4,2.2736641433631537E-4,2.2735461203143666E-4,2.2750219694523893E-4,2.2743448501087046E-4,2.2737772801157864E-4,2.2739975380719934E-4]}}
{"value":"It makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie is jaw dropping in how appalling it is. Turning the DVD player off was not a sufficient course of action. I want to find the people responsible for this disaster and slap them around the face. I will never get that time back. Never. How is it possible to create such a banal, boring and soulless film? I could not think of a course of action that would relieve the tedium. Writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a disgraceful piece of cinema. What more can you say than reiterate how truly awful the acting is.

{"value":"This movie sucked plain and simple. Okay so it's basically about a girl that gets raped, and to get revenge she gets another guy to rape the rapist. The rapist is a douche, but the girl victim is partly to blame. I mean they both get in the mood and start kissing and stuff, but when the rapist tries to have sex with her, she doesn't allow it so the rapist rapes her. And the thing is the rape scene for the girl is very short and it doesn't really expose or show anything, but when it comes to the rapist getting raped, it's a pretty long rape scene. There is basically nothing in the story that is worth watching.<br /><br />3.2/10","finished_norm":["thi","movi","suck","plain","and","simpl","okai","so","it","basic","about","a","girl","that","get","rape","and","to","get","reveng","she","get","anoth","gui","to","rape","the","rapist","the","rapist","be","a","douch","but","the","girl","victim","be","partli","to","blame","i","mean","thei","both","get","in","the","mood","and","start","kiss","and","stuff","but","when","the","rapist","try","to","have","sex","with","her","she","doe","not","allow","it","so","the","rapist","rape","her","and","the","thing","be","the","rape","scene","for","the","girl","be","veri","short","and","it","doe","not","realli","expos","or","show","anyth","but","when","it","come","to","the","rapist","get","rape","it","a","pretti","long","rape","scene","there","be","basic","noth","in","the","stori","that","be","worth","watchingbr","br"],"filtered":["thi","movi","suck","plain","simpl","okai","basic","girl","get","rape","get","reveng","get","anoth","gui","rape","rapist","rapist","douch","girl","victim","partli","blame","mean","thei","get","mood","start","kiss","stuff","rapist","try","sex","doe","allow","rapist","rape","thing","rape","scene","girl","veri","short","doe","realli","expos","show","anyth","come","rapist","get","rape","pretti","long","rape","scene","basic","noth","stori","worth","watchingbr","br"],"filtered2":["suck","plain","simpl","okai","basic","girl","get","rape","get","reveng","get","anoth","gui","rape","rapist","rapist","douch","girl","victim","partli","blame","mean","get","mood","start","kiss","stuff","rapist","try","sex","doe","allow","rapist","rape","thing","rape","scene","girl","veri","short","doe","realli","expos","show","anyth","come","rapist","get","rape","pretti","long","rape","scene","basic","noth","stori","worth","watchingbr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,13,15,17,18,19,28,29,34,36,49,55,71,73,78,84,88,99,104,191,219,254,272,286,361,421,521,535,586,736,746,871,898,1129,1461,1790,2849,3069,4402],"values":[5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,13,15,17,18,19,28,29,34,36,49,55,71,73,78,84,88,99,104,191,219,254,272,286,361,421,521,535,586,736,746,871,898,1129,1461,1790,2849,3069,4402],"values":[3.983170235359962,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,2.430631986809635,2.62476135602347,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.6920303308087352,1.9536997889255368,1.9214926742550966,1.8950689206770979,2.0064197866819473,6.6638083547706675,2.0317223413467334,2.056430207256609,2.0728240170322856,2.5460113484259455,2.5792094178355414,2.889652074525771,2.8028805344481915,5.561401781474432,3.0399731661399314,3.2597778161886266,3.4076979462652486,3.4986697244709752,3.4572130107926293,3.6841709341823097,24.051683415654963,3.9954846111673676,3.892300374932137,4.197121957260614,4.6295428753573065,4.760735085628657,28.479471509035974,5.583416318380505,5.9370563586240825]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.118807647961298E-4,2.1169300653874434E-4,2.1174527517734873E-4,2.1170270760391543E-4,2.1172274275403058E-4,2.1169183932737032E-4,2.1175767842838503E-4,2.1166034303434335E-4,2.1169305127789715E-4,2.1191181310725404E-4,2.1359327166514588E-4,2.1169340094007554E-4,2.1189388796841977E-4,2.1191596365579464E-4,2.1181969576676945E-4,2.117035414702399E-4,2.1177637567609516E-4,2.118760383584706E-4,2.1171447081128587E-4,2.1171369676217496E-4,2.1190416541618475E-4,2.1173490831315585E-4,2.1173522875559005E-4,2.1187086861014439E-4,2.117145471820265E-4,2.1191849657461973E-4,2.1176752792775869E-4,2.116925320907913E-4,2.117885044381764E-4,2.11853145342594E-4,2.117359469071497E-4,2.1184934806943348E-4,2.119533608105547E-4,2.1215008639459366E-4,2.1176716198751682E-4,2.11703413068686E-4,2.1177974410483183E-4,2.11724913527262E-4,2.1166056894252475E-4,2.1171440524675952E-4,2.1192657926066678E-4,2.1181032419177913E-4,2.118498308375969E-4,2.1167110326541518E-4,2.1171445908036948E-4,2.1170333346011964E-4,2.1177499311905094E-4,2.1181171516755458E-4,2.117686444521778E-4,2.1173507874789002E-4,2.1170385698619584E-4,2.1213760380898704E-4,2.1175712777489413E-4,2.1171441055568426E-4,2.117559937370445E-4,2.1169274868102948E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502653E-4,2.1170415419131475E-4,2.1169262784141E-4,2.118619870217944E-4,2.1177694030929717E-4,2.1169253934833314E-4,2.1167101702582126E-4,2.1164973116690375E-4,2.118410960276969E-4,2.1170291001284917E-4,2.1179914228165449E-4,2.1186129996057565E-4,2.1176518261149853E-4,2.1171469096440762E-4,2.1167129451241955E-4,2.1172544394045402E-4,2.116711805036387E-4,2.1168228866486722E-4,2.1167130050324477E-4,2.118087047562751E-4,2.1174566370740742E-4,2.1169282190338412E-4,2.1171332832180243E-4]}}
{"value":"Disjointed, unclear, bad screenplay, poor photography and direction...all in all very obviously an ill-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good people at TBN.<br /><br />TBN Pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring \"China Cry\", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. But \"The Omega Code\" is an unfortunate miscue. As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved \"China Cry\", I still find it impossible to recommend this film to anyone.

{"value":"The youthful group in \"St. Elmo's Fire\" who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university. For the most part, these kids are irresponsible, selfish, greedy and stupid, yet co-writer and director Joel Schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation. With a now-outdated cast of \"up and comers\", a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of \"Terms Of Endearment\", and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us, \"Fire\"

{"value":"I really looked forward to see Planet of the Apes, but it was a huge dissapointment.<br /><br />The settings and masks are great, but that is the only good aspect of the film. All other things are really annoying. Mark Wahlberg is not acting, he is just in the movie, looking stupid. The other actors are also not very good.<br /><br />But the worst point of all, is the story. It is absolutely ridiculous! For example: the apes are lying unconsiousness on the ground, but the humans don`t attack them, no, they wait until they are up again! This is just one example for the stupid story, but it would take too long to tell them all.","finished_norm":["i","realli","look","forward","to","see","planet","of","the","ap","but","it","be","a","huge","dissapointmentbr","br","the","set","and","mask","be","great","but","that","be","the","onli","good","aspect","of","the","film","all","other","thing","be","realli","annoi","mark","wahlberg","be","not","act","he","be","just","in","the","movi","look","stupid","the","other","actor","be","conjur","not","veri","goodbr","br","but","the","wrong","point","of","all","be","the","stori","it","be","absolut","ridicul","for","exampl","the","ap","be","lie","unconsi","on","the","grind","but","the","human","do","attack","them","no","thei","wait","until","thei","be","up","again","thi","be","just","on","exampl","for","the","stupid","stori","but","it","would","take","too","long","to","tell","them","all"],"filtered":["realli","look","forward","see","planet","ap","huge","dissapointmentbr","br","set","mask","great","onli","good","aspect","film","thing","realli","annoi","mark","wahlberg","act","movi","look","stupid","actor","conjur","veri","goodbr","br","wrong","point","stori","absolut","ridicul","exampl","ap","lie","unconsi","grind","human","attack","thei","wait","thei","thi","exampl","stupid","stori","take","long","tell"],"filtered2":["realli","look","forward","see","planet","ap","huge","dissapointmentbr","set","mask","great","onli","good","aspect","thing","realli","annoi","mark","wahlberg","act","look","stupid","actor","conjur","veri","goodbr","wrong","point","stori","absolut","ridicul","exampl","ap","lie","unconsi","grind","human","attack","wait","exampl","stupid","stori","take","long","tell"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,11,13,15,16,17,21,25,29,31,39,41,51,66,90,99,109,136,222,271,274,292,307,331,444,495,645,650,699,717,1007,1064,1340,1441,2486,6507],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,11,13,15,16,17,21,25,29,31,39,41,51,66,90,99,109,136,222,271,274,292,307,331,444,495,645,650,699,717,1007,1064,1340,1441,2486,6507],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9913098153388195,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.7139899308309823,1.929723173391612,2.0477128419653545,2.056430207256609,2.125691139326857,4.693651971159972,2.5771019354959765,2.757740698455715,2.748952192422636,2.9752256367457734,5.753571127865041,2.932274249550174,3.2535472664379905,3.5173618574831282,3.558633189238533,3.6621227969605474,3.5813614403160887,3.7398317812878634,4.358390104856736,4.105687751300982,4.5432147918688095,10.258997653772786,5.143104478942172,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.793182480923801E-4,2.7907073007172234E-4,2.791396347907477E-4,2.790835187952803E-4,2.7910993073992197E-4,2.790691913599074E-4,2.791559857528251E-4,2.7902767041581346E-4,2.7907078905046827E-4,2.79359178470736E-4,2.815758122415372E-4,2.7907125000324606E-4,2.7933554811249747E-4,2.793646500573055E-4,2.7923774199117716E-4,2.790846180648677E-4,2.7918063396702034E-4,2.7931201732250366E-4,2.790990260003719E-4,2.7909800558664153E-4,2.793490966699011E-4,2.791259683574245E-4,2.791263907903877E-4,2.793052021448874E-4,2.790991266784183E-4,2.793679891544126E-4,2.7916897015427505E-4,2.790701046163103E-4,2.7919662307570285E-4,2.792818379095949E-4,2.791273375154748E-4,2.7927683203901604E-4,2.7941394999145134E-4,2.796732894625996E-4,2.791684877424461E-4,2.7908444879562265E-4,2.791850745004234E-4,2.7911279242761027E-4,2.7902796822612915E-4,2.7909893956794534E-4,2.7937864440057765E-4,2.79225387628049E-4,2.7927746846279793E-4,2.7904185541696225E-4,2.7909901053573536E-4,2.790843438492142E-4,2.791788113692406E-4,2.7922722132407663E-4,2.7917044204647345E-4,2.791261930381849E-4,2.790850340033515E-4,2.796568339153173E-4,2.791552598371502E-4,2.790989465665965E-4,2.7915376485734047E-4,2.790703901429646E-4,0.9779431299389859,2.791139297842153E-4,2.7908542580301876E-4,2.7907023084246913E-4,2.792934937215174E-4,2.7918137831187367E-4,2.7907011418378506E-4,2.790417417290005E-4,2.790136809995251E-4,2.792659535345739E-4,2.7908378562699966E-4,2.792106467356922E-4,2.792925879822157E-4,2.791658783699423E-4,2.7909931622390556E-4,2.790421075341295E-4,2.79113491660897E-4,2.790419572385944E-4,2.790566009092308E-4,2.7904211543171666E-4,2.792232527580512E-4,2.791401469822882E-4,2.7907048667055566E-4,2.7909751987893945E-4]}}
{"value":"Jerry spies Tom listening to a creepy story on the radio and seizes the opportunity to scare his nemesis.<br /><br />I didn't find this particular episode that funny: the humour seemed rather constrained and the whole set up was kinda lame (Jerry is essentially the 'bad guy' in this one, tormenting poor Tom for no particular reason).<br /><br />There is the occasional flash of

Too many warrior-wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over, but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings. And who in the world would've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place? I thought this was a \"family\" movie!

{"value":"I read that \"There's a Girl in My Soup\" came out during Peter Sellers's low period. Watching the movie, I'm not surprised. Almost nothing happens in the movie. Seemingly, the very presence of Sellers and Goldie Hawn should help the movie; it doesn't. The whole movie seems like they just randomly filmed whatever happened without scripting anything. Maybe I haven't seen every movie about middle-aged to elderly people trying to be hippies, but this one gives such movies a pretty bad name.<br /><br />All in all, both Sellers and Hawn have starred in much better movies than this, so don't waste your time on this.

{"value":"Alicia Silverstone (pre-\"Clueless\") plays a modern-day crime-obsessed teenager attempting to solve the brutal slaying of a local girl. Pat Verducci wrote and directed this B-flick, which isn't especially well-made but is however surprisingly serious-minded in regards to its leading character. Silverstone is appealing and successful in carving out an interesting young woman here, despite the picture's kitschy undermining. The supporting cast (including Kevin Dillon and Michael Bowen) isn't bad, though the violence in the last act goes overboard. Not a cheesy camp-fest, but nothing exceptionally memorable either. *1/2 from

{"value":"I am a huge fan of warrior movies. Some of my favorites are Braveheart, Troy, The last samurai and Gladiator. And after watching Mongol, which is absolutely awesome, and which i strongly recommend, i had high expectations from a Sergei Bodrov movie. But it was terrible, awful, even pathetic is not a strong word in this case. The whole movie i was waiting for something exciting to happen, but it didn't, then i was at least expecting a big epic battle at the end, but even that was a huge disappointment, just some random running around, waving with the swords... There are so many good warrior movies, this one is not one of them.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","huge","fan","of","warrior","movi","some","of","my","favorit","be","braveheart","troi","the","last","samurai","and","gladiat","and","after","watch","mongol","which","be","absolut","awesom","and","which","i","strongli","recommend","i","have","high","expect","from","a","sergei","bodrov","movi","but","it","be","terribl","aw","even","pathet","be","not","a","strong","word","in","thi","case","the","whole","movi","i","be","wait","for","someth","excit","to","happen","but","it","do","not","then","i","be","at","littl","expect","a","big","epic","battl","at","the","end","but","even","that","be","a","huge","disappoint","just","some","random","run","around","wave","with","the","sword","there","be","so","mani","good","warrior","movi","thi","on","be","not","on","of","them"],"filtered":["huge","fan","warrior","movi","favorit","braveheart","troi","last","samurai","gladiat","watch","mongol","absolut","awesom","strongli","recommend","high","expect","sergei","bodrov","movi","terribl","aw","even","pathet","strong","word","thi","case","whole","movi","wait","someth","excit","happen","littl","expect","big","epic","battl","end","even","huge","disappoint","random","run","around","wave","sword","mani","good","warrior","movi","thi"],"filtered2":["huge","fan","warrior","favorit","braveheart","troi","last","samurai","gladiat","watch","mongol","absolut","awesom","strongli","recommend","high","expect","sergei","bodrov","terribl","aw","even","pathet","strong","word","case","whole","wait","someth","excit","happen","littl","expect","big","epic","battl","end","even","huge","disappoint","random","run","around","wave","sword","mani","good","warrior"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,14,24,50,53,82,94,98,111,130,137,138,140,144,166,187,211,222,258,288,298,331,444,524,602,631,786,822,859,1567,1679,1775,1804,1942,2217,2953,5435,5844],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,14,24,50,53,82,94,98,111,130,137,138,140,144,166,187,211,222,258,288,298,331,444,524,602,631,786,822,859,1567,1679,1775,1804,1942,2217,2953,5435,5844],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,0.9609497720722932,1.1175081997259209,1.3210361566119257,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,2.020196584395323,2.08112281984698,2.0881990796736947,2.1183455303375887,4.528427806839927,2.2939035841256437,2.2907365189289424,2.317169775997098,2.2931108769894046,2.4423870329693536,2.4732161909892554,2.5687161421197025,2.5771019354959765,2.7061321952397077,2.8015621426949333,2.7819920465008363,2.932274249550174,6.507094532875981,3.4028786598293,3.506637894120152,3.607563812710113,3.900174431363043,3.813163054373413,3.9405024767500145,4.679973728984199,4.706176101378222,10.179516996473758,4.869215728622727,5.0768550934009715,5.00274712124725,5.822646007446338,6.489124940924123,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.7310929654841837E-4,2.7286728059361924E-4,2.7293465363304793E-4,2.7287978503727267E-4,2.7290560987210116E-4,2.728657760857533E-4,2.729506411303967E-4,2.728251781086752E-4,2.728673382613295E-4,2.7314931708741496E-4,2.753166774155836E-4,2.7286778896761074E-4,2.7312621200724276E-4,2.7315466704635674E-4,2.730305800133636E-4,2.7288085987125073E-4,2.729747414406557E-4,2.731032042820178E-4,2.7289494753346806E-4,2.728939498024641E-4,2.7313945939443296E-4,2.7292129099019616E-4,2.72921704032918E-4,2.730965405986483E-4,2.728950459735472E-4,2.731579319188392E-4,2.72963336902228E-4,2.7286666904142466E-4,2.7299037512823086E-4,2.730736957257883E-4,2.7292262971329983E-4,2.7306880113045934E-4,2.7320287109470093E-4,2.7345644572155135E-4,2.7296286521390776E-4,2.728806943646834E-4,2.729790832656611E-4,2.7290840794747515E-4,2.7282546929898013E-4,2.7289486302234367E-4,2.7316835031006336E-4,2.730185002747634E-4,2.7306942340720846E-4,2.7283904779213395E-4,2.728949324125942E-4,2.7288059175112345E-4,2.729729593573121E-4,2.7302029320965253E-4,2.7296477607580746E-4,2.7292151067653906E-4,2.7288126656385854E-4,2.7344035596381703E-4,2.729499313510655E-4,2.7289486986542213E-4,2.7294846960308815E-4,2.7286694822112106E-4,0.9784334310143922,2.7290952002183635E-4,2.728816496542303E-4,2.728667924617084E-4,2.730850924412432E-4,2.729754692395041E-4,2.728666783962245E-4,2.7283893663133626E-4,2.7281149966243076E-4,2.730581644437553E-4,2.72880045937603E-4,2.7300408705697483E-4,2.730842068355757E-4,2.7296031384501653E-4,2.728952313056372E-4,2.7283929430500114E-4,2.729090916375397E-4,2.7283914735037803E-4,2.7285346550758304E-4,2.728393020270332E-4,2.730164128606853E-4,2.7293515443910796E-4,2.7286704260300504E-4,2.728934748915346E-4]}}
{"value":"The Good Earth is perhaps the most boring film I've seen in my life. The plot is slow and lacking. The acting is borderline comical. While I love Paul Muni, I can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice. The only saving grace I found with this film is it's production value. The use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment. Also, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time. Other than the production value I can say little else that is good or entertaining about this

{"value":"Saw it yesterday night at the Midnight Slam of the Festival des films du Monde in Montreal. What a disappointment. This movie is clearly over rated by IMDb fans. The acting was only but regular. The directing didn't bring anything new or interesting. The plot lacks considerably : the movie is all about those college grads and the game they play making prank calls(7eventy 5ive). And on top of that, you can predict the movie's end in the first five minutes. If you like prank calls and a slasher with an axe that makes you jump only once or twice during the whole movie, you might like it. If you don't, this movie is not worth

{"value":"I still find it difficult to comprehend that a movie as bad as this could be made in Hollywood. The acting and story is simply pathetic & the direction is awful. I don't see any logic behind this trash except may be that the director had nothing good to do. I took me ten minutes to realize that i had wasted my precious thirty rupees. It filled me with dismay that i was going to waste some more time of my life on this crap. I bet the movie was made in less than a day. I don't know what category it falls into.

{"value":"This film (along with Rinne) are minor gems amongst the retread homage pics that have passed for horror movies so far at the 8FTDF \"HorrorFest.\" And, yes, that's faint praise indeed. 'Cause there's not much worse in filmdom than would-be auteurs who think atmosphere is a substitute for a coherent plot.<br /><br />And that's all you get with The Abandoned. This is a film that was made almost entirely in the directors head. Sure, it would have been nice if he'd transfered it to film, but this happened instead. It's a very pretty film with a few genuine scares, but the last reel is strictly for the latte slurping cineaste crowd.","finished_norm":["thi","film","along","with","rinn","be","minor","gem","amongst","the","retread","homag","pic","that","have","pass","for","horror","movi","so","far","at","the","ftdf","horrorfest","and","ye","that","faint","prais","ind","caus","there","not","much","wrong","in","filmdom","than","wouldb","auteur","who","think","atmospher","be","a","substitut","for","a","coher","plotbr","br","and","that","all","you","get","with","the","abandon","thi","be","a","film","that","be","make","almost","entir","in","the","director","head","sure","it","would","have","be","nice","if","he","have","transfer","it","to","film","but","thi","happen","instead","it","a","veri","pretti","film","with","a","few","genuin","scare","but","the","last","reel","be","strictli","for","the","latt","slurp","cineast","crowd"],"filtered":["thi","film","along","rinn","minor","gem","amongst","retread","homag","pic","pass","horror","movi","far","ftdf","horrorfest","ye","faint","prais","ind","caus","much","wrong","filmdom","wouldb","auteur","think","atmospher","substitut","coher","plotbr","br","get","abandon","thi","film","make","almost","entir","director","head","sure","nice","transfer","film","thi","happen","instead","veri","pretti","film","genuin","scare","last","reel","strictli","latt","slurp","cineast","crowd"],"filtered2":["along","rinn","minor","gem","amongst","retread","homag","pic","pass","horror","far","ftdf","horrorfest","ye","faint","prais","ind","caus","wrong","filmdom","wouldb","auteur","think","atmospher","substitut","coher","plotbr","get","abandon","make","almost","entir","director","head","sure","nice","transfer","happen","instead","veri","pretti","genuin","scare","last","reel","strictli","latt","slurp","cineast","crowd"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,12,15,25,58,78,83,94,101,119,131,144,152,198,208,209,262,324,452,487,623,829,835,1097,1166,1486,1653,1720,1850,2015,2187,2195,2335,2385,2638,2931,3222,3667,4499,4712,6069,6554],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,12,15,25,58,78,83,94,101,119,131,144,152,198,208,209,262,324,452,487,623,829,835,1097,1166,1486,1653,1720,1850,2015,2187,2195,2335,2385,2638,2931,3222,3667,4499,4712,6069,6554],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2796387880827016,1.865701314626681,2.0064197866819473,2.292318797740072,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,2.1653408989309972,2.2512118082053005,2.2931108769894046,2.3131195476980753,2.5439726117360975,2.6289494000279396,2.6026896854443837,2.726701583487816,2.8753661172782943,3.2872346624216657,3.3220965805878846,3.607563812710113,3.8240921249056035,3.8614098879127985,4.186539847930077,4.246178114249808,4.558366596889411,4.662879295624898,4.724033718778229,4.789173020949191,4.979216623837056,5.064116067623542,5.039114765418124,5.0768550934009715,5.129498826886393,5.339219357868463,5.3560264761848435,5.501738287366237,5.695894301807195,6.101359409915359,6.101359409915359,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.793182480923801E-4,2.790707300717223E-4,2.7913963479074766E-4,2.7908351879528024E-4,2.791099307399219E-4,2.790691913599074E-4,2.79155985752825E-4,2.790276704158134E-4,2.790707890504682E-4,2.79359178470736E-4,2.8157581224153716E-4,2.79071250003246E-4,2.793355481124974E-4,2.7936465005730545E-4,2.792377419911771E-4,2.7908461806486765E-4,2.791806339670203E-4,2.793120173225036E-4,2.790990260003718E-4,2.790980055866415E-4,2.7934909666990106E-4,2.7912596835742443E-4,2.791263907903877E-4,2.7930520214488735E-4,2.790991266784183E-4,2.7936798915441255E-4,2.79168970154275E-4,2.7907010461631027E-4,2.791966230757028E-4,2.792818379095949E-4,2.7912733751547477E-4,2.79276832039016E-4,2.794139499914513E-4,2.7967328946259954E-4,2.7916848774244604E-4,2.790844487956226E-4,2.7918507450042335E-4,2.791127924276102E-4,2.7902796822612915E-4,2.790989395679453E-4,2.793786444005776E-4,2.79225387628049E-4,2.792774684627979E-4,2.7904185541696225E-4,2.790990105357353E-4,2.7908434384921416E-4,2.7917881136924056E-4,2.792272213240766E-4,2.7917044204647345E-4,2.7912619303818487E-4,2.7908503400335145E-4,2.7965683391531726E-4,2.791552598371501E-4,2.7909894656659646E-4,2.7915376485734047E-4,2.7907039014296456E-4,0.8186550013545348,2.791139297842152E-4,2.790854258030187E-4,0.15956719881529358,2.792934937215174E-4,2.791813783118736E-4,2.79070114183785E-4,2.7904174172900043E-4,2.7901368099952505E-4,2.7926595353457384E-4,2.790837856269996E-4,2.7921064673569213E-4,2.7929258798221565E-4,2.7916587836994227E-4,2.790993162239055E-4,2.7904210753412946E-4,2.7911349166089694E-4,2.790419572385943E-4,2.790566009092308E-4,2.790421154317166E-4,2.7922325275805114E-4,2.791401469822882E-4,2.790704866705556E-4,2.7909751987893945E-4]}}

costs.","finished_norm":["thi","have","to","be","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","the","dvd","be","give","to","me","free","with","a","order","i","place","onlin","for","non","dvd","relat","itemsbr","br","no","wonder","thei","be","give","awai","sure","no","on","can","part","with","monei","for","thi","drivelbr","br","how","some","review","can","sai","thei","find","it","hilari","beggar","belief","the","person","who","includ","it","in","the","wrong","five","film","ever","have","get","it","spot","onbr","br","how","on","earth","a","talent","actor","like","philip","seymour","hoffman","can","get","involv","in","thi","rubbish","be","unbeliev","mostli","toilet","humour","and","badli","do","at","thatbr","br","anyon","want","to","be","entertain","should","avoid","thi","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","film","ever","see","dvd","give","free","order","place","onlin","non","dvd","relat","itemsbr","br","wonder","thei","give","awai","sure","part","monei","thi","drivelbr","br","review","sai","thei","find","hilari","beggar","belief","person","includ","wrong","five","film","ever","get","spot","onbr","br","earth","talent","actor","like","philip","seymour","hoffman","get","involv","thi","rubbish","unbeliev","mostli","toilet","humour","badli","thatbr","br","anyon","want","entertain","avoid","thi","cost"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","see","dvd","give","free","order","place","onlin","non","dvd","relat","itemsbr","wonder","give","awai","sure","part","monei","drivelbr","review","find","hilari","beggar","belief","person","includ","wrong","five","ever","get","spot","onbr","earth","talent","actor","like","philip","seymour","hoffman","get","involv","rubbish","unbeliev","mostli","toilet","humour","badli","thatbr","anyon","want","entertain","avoid","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,25,30,37,38,41,44,61,119,126,153,155,158,164,175,176,195,241,247,276,301,335,439,448,504,510,522,571,632,686,836,903,1005,1098,1235,1513,1600,1891,2083,2606,3488,3746,4111,5752,7154,8221],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,25,30,37,38,41,44,61,119,126,153,155,158,164,175,176,195,241,247,276,301,335,439,448,504,510,522,571,632,686,836,903,1005,1098,1235,1513,1600,1891,2083,2606,3488,3746,4111,5752,7154,8221],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,2.559277576165403,2.6728839783437044,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,3.209458785004948,1.8818517047392527,2.1653408989309972,2.2391270689902285,2.3409902041158843,2.3074766467914385,2.3106972614914807,2.3930275298746078,2.3791142619576227,2.5040471493269134,2.51289241584188,2.6627744961815836,5.460751613699401,2.7884729505849193,2.8309760279012264,2.908534262247101,3.2872346624216657,3.2681460658591432,3.3956930001684253,3.374440724508766,3.604618302480356,3.467417180966871,3.541919708264792,3.6016814428070463,3.7881170224473255,3.948766986599908,4.062925891962901,4.186539847930077,4.4637506205145625,4.535724120139652,4.558366596889411,4.869215728622727,4.9227044135737135,5.243909178064138,5.626901430320244,5.7446844659766265,6.1754673820690815,6.389041482367141,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125572E-4,2.273779263270828E-4,2.274340676935461E-4,2.2738834617097765E-4,2.2740986578072443E-4,2.2737667263379293E-4,2.2744738993572337E-4,2.2734284269338746E-4,2.2737797438108308E-4,2.276129448788429E-4,2.294189873473668E-4,2.2737834995069841E-4,2.2759369161694305E-4,2.2761740295299337E-4,2.2751400231007027E-4,2.273892418207622E-4,2.2746747251417917E-4,2.2757451948007208E-4,2.2740098094688535E-4,2.2740014954633704E-4,2.276047305492108E-4,2.2742293271974025E-4,2.2742327690463982E-4,2.275689666908077E-4,2.2740106297614517E-4,2.2762012354277298E-4,2.2745796921172103E-4,2.2737741672596996E-4,2.2748049992975627E-4,2.2754993025739294E-4,2.2742404826603285E-4,2.2754585163377162E-4,2.2765757096628256E-4,2.2786887249242002E-4,2.274575761579555E-4,2.2738910390558234E-4,2.274710905191083E-4,2.2741219739254268E-4,2.2734308533973026E-4,2.274009105245021E-4,2.2762880509736273E-4,2.275039363691941E-4,2.2754637017156223E-4,2.2735440017971123E-4,2.2740096834679297E-4,2.2738901839859736E-4,2.2746598751966334E-4,2.2750543040620818E-4,2.2745916846251944E-4,2.2742311578245478E-4,2.2738958071416712E-4,2.2785546503755488E-4,2.2744679848279382E-4,2.2740091622677975E-4,2.2744558042094644E-4,2.2737764936397737E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.274131240744139E-4,2.273898999400345E-4,2.2737751957101657E-4,2.2755942704103598E-4,2.2746807898261525E-4,2.2737742452124313E-4,2.273543075503875E-4,2.2733144456336734E-4,2.275369881754614E-4,2.273885635769486E-4,2.274919259604513E-4,2.275586890735531E-4,2.2745545012449876E-4,2.274012174117602E-4,2.273546055967346E-4,2.2741276710551368E-4,2.27354

{"value":"I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and very much like the book. Years later, I laid eyes on this version and was horrified. William Hurt is totally miscast as Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a passionate character, where as William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two zombies together. This is story about love and passion, but I couldn't see it in this version. No, back to the BBC-version. A wonderful time is guaranteed.","finished_norm":["i","read","the","novel","jane","eyr","for","the","time","back","in","it","be","round","that","time","that","i","see","the","bbcversion","with","timothi","dalton","and","zelah","clark","it","be","a","excel","version","and","veri","much","like","the","book","year","late","i","lai","ey","on","thi","version","and","be","horrifi","william","hurt","be","total","miscast","a","mr","rochest","mr","rochest","be","a","passion","charact","where","a","william","hurt","portrai","him","a","a","block","of","ic","the","same","go","for","charlott","gainsborough","it","be","like","watch","two","zombi","togeth","thi","be","stori","about","love","and","passion","but","i","can","not","see","it","in","thi","version","no","back","to","the","bbcversion","a","wonder","time","be","guarante"],"filtered":["read","novel","jane","eyr","time","back","round","time","see","bbcversion","timothi","dalton","zelah","clark","excel","version","veri","much","like","book","year","late","lai","ey","thi","version","horrifi","william","hurt","total","miscast","mr","rochest","mr","rochest","passion","charact","william","hurt","portrai","block","ic","go","charlott","gainsborough","like","watch","two","zombi","togeth","thi","stori","love","passion","see","thi","version","back","bbcversion","wonder","time","guarante"],"filtered2":["read","novel","jane","eyr","time","back","round","time","see","bbcversion","timothi","dalton","zelah","clark","excel","version","veri","like","book","year","late","lai","ey","version","horrifi","william","hurt","total","miscast","mr","rochest","mr","rochest","passion","charact","william","hurt","portrai","block","ic","go","charlott","gainsborough","like","watch","two","zombi","togeth","stori","love","passion","see","version","back","bbcversion","wonder","time","guarante"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,8,10,15,17,47,54,57,63,145,150,151,175,184,220,268,270,281,357,469,474,580,720,863,1067,1464,1480,1541,1708,1773,1979,2204,2467,2562,2738,3689,3932,4238,6010],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,8,10,15,17,47,54,57,63,145,150,151,175,184,220,268,270,281,357,469,474,580,720,863,1067,1464,1480,1541,1708,1773,1979,2204,2467,2562,2738,3689,3932,4238,6010],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,2.825681057716235,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,3.745925514644013,2.34599021453259,2.332712011146513,2.8002454868101863,2.3791142619576227,2.496249838866882,8.501080262633181,3.6746621462132825,2.731603554088023,2.832333801361687,6.565922303288567,3.328770687675578,3.6466665387238555,3.5039747767006686,7.715229633888494,7.889252387867754,4.74221603786142,9.178753667263944,4.5432147918688095,4.605250182788262,4.671389985292807,5.02684467282631,4.979216623837056,5.039114765418124,5.185068678041204,5.259176650194926,12.875663293073144,5.7959777603641776,5.9370563586240825,6.489124940924123,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164655E-4,2.232427581278421E-4,2.232978784893336E-4,2.2325298847309999E-4,2.2327411672029313E-4,2.2324152723462217E-4,2.2331095844892396E-4,2.2320831253640845E-4,2.2324280530791686E-4,2.2347350255652804E-4,2.2524669975505118E-4,2.232431740473022E-4,2.2345459944064997E-4,2.234778795547062E-4,2.2337635938917728E-4,2.2325386783430908E-4,2.2333067579914E-4,0.12925992843948375,2.2326539346890378E-4,2.2326457718847362E-4,2.2346543761534018E-4,2.2328694601974757E-4,2.232872839451897E-4,2.2343032416998442E-4,2.2326547400635307E-4,2.2348055066696387E-4,2.2332134532680108E-4,2.2324225779449922E-4,2.233434662939417E-4,2.2341163393927872E-4,2.23288041278356E-4,2.2340762949082018E-4,2.235173170595689E-4,2.2372477578809865E-4,2.233209594212379E-4,2.2325373242729912E-4,2.2333422800586625E-4,2.232764059286679E-4,2.232085507699067E-4,2.2326532432724466E-4,2.234890743360058E-4,2.233664765107438E-4,2.2340813859831552E-4,2.2321965983456365E-4,2.2326538109796072E-4,2.2325364847537168E-4,2.2332921781121273E-4,2.2336794337671957E-4,2.2332252276763823E-4,2.2328712575322464E-4,2.232542005644894E-4,2.237116121655258E-4,2.2331037775234788E-4,2.2326532992581884E-4,2.2330918184256554E-4,2.232424862016769E-4,0.8533191040455302,2.2327731575760417E-4,2.2325451398481235E-4,2.2324235876917267E-4,2.2342095801135584E-4,2.2333127123814577E-4,2.2324226544800504E-4,2.2321956888982664E-4,2.2319712169645184E-4,2.2339892722621741E-4,2.2325320192525592E-4,2.2335468452716256E-4,2.2342023346478724E-4,2.2331887205251033E-4,2.2326562563335225E-4,2.2321986151580686E-4,2.2327696528065536E-4,2.2321974128682482E-4,2.2323145549784634E-4,2.232198678334853E-4,2.2336476872051285E-4,2.232982882171906E-4,2.232425634189675E-4,2.2326418864637525E-4]}}
{"value":"You know what kind of movie you're getting into when the serial killer main character is being transported to the electric chair (in what seems to be a bakery truck), only to have the prison vehicle collide with (and I'm not making this up) a genetic engineering tanker truck. The goo which spurts forth melts him, and fuses his DNA with the snow, creating our protagonist, the killer snowman.<br /><br />My favorite portion of the movie, however, is an over-the-shoulder shot

{"value":"Rarely has such an amazing cast been wasted so badly. Griffin Dunne, Rosanna Arquette, Illeana Douglas, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, and John Turturro, all jumped on board, only to be torpedoed by a script that seems like nothing more than a Hollywood in joke. Attaching Martin Scorsese's name to this was probably the draw, but the end result is way less than the sum of it's parts. Resembling a nightmare gone horribly wrong, each scene seems more contrived than the next. \"Search and Destroy\" is nothing more than abstract, stylish, self indulgent nonsense, and the entire film is decidedly dull..........

{"value":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The Avengers held this dubious honor but no longer. The acting in \"Jill the Ripper\" is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot. This movie is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes. It doesn't know whether it wants to be an S&M flick or a really bad thriller. Only watch under extreme intoxication or if you're bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction. This script should be reworked into a porn, it wouldn't take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life. A porn, even a bad porn, wouldn't do the damage to Dolf Lundgren's career the way that this movie has.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","the","aveng","hold","thi","dubiou","honor","but","no","long","the","act","in","jill","the","ripper","be","terribl","and","be","onli","eclips","by","the","plot","thi","movi","be","a","intellectu","stimul","a","the","telletubb","it","doe","not","know","whether","it","want","to","be","a","sm","flick","or","a","realli","bad","thriller","onli","watch","under","extrem","intox","or","if","you","re","bed","ride","and","ne","a","leather","cloth","distract","thi","script","should","be","rework","into","a","porn","it","would","not","take","veri","much","effort","and","would","have","a","long","shelf","life","a","porn","even","a","bad","porn","would","not","do","the","damag","to","dolf","lundgren","career","the","wai","that","thi","movi","have"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","movi","ever","see","aveng","hold","thi","dubiou","honor","long","act","jill","ripper","terribl","onli","eclips","plot","thi","movi","intellectu","stimul","telletubb","doe","know","whether","want","sm","flick","realli","bad","thriller","onli","watch","extrem","intox","re","bed","ride","ne","leather","cloth","distract","thi","script","rework","porn","take","veri","much","effort","long","shelf","life","porn","even","bad","porn","damag","dolf","lundgren","career","wai","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","see","aveng","hold","dubiou","honor","long","act","jill","ripper","terribl","onli","eclips","plot","intellectu","stimul","telletubb","doe","know","whether","want","sm","flick","realli","bad","thriller","onli","watch","extrem","intox","re","bed","ride","ne","leather","cloth","distract","script","rework","porn","take","veri","effort","long","shelf","life","porn","even","bad","porn","damag","dolf","lundgren","career","wai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,9,11,13,15,18,21,25,26,31,32,33,37,44,68,75,77,99,110,166,257,329,401,414,511,597,714,879,971,1002,1065,1356,1704,1779,2050,2325,2477,2961,3901,4146,4227,4932,5084,5477,7239],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,9,11,13,15,18,21,25,26,31,32,33,37,44,68,75,77,99,110,166,257,329,401,414,511,597,714,879,971,1002,1065,1356,1704,1779,2050,2325,2477,2961,3901,4146,4227,4932,5084,5477,7239],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,1.982619630677639,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.604729392502474,2.0064197866819473,1.9742250248702675,1.9463902258768238,4.112860414513218,2.1290479736304078,2.4423870329693536,2.7602659523229094,2.951986790814132,3.0879275592619675,3.1254654785810323,3.3909310864081816,3.4986697244709752,3.7297814454343623,3.8962296530720266,12.5438714761318,4.072271754381138,4.1302590120314875,4.396611317676934,4.869215728622727,4.8085911068062925,5.02684467282631,6.255510089742618,5.156897801074508,5.501738287366237,6.543192162194399,5.878215858601149,6.0662680901040895,6.137727054086234,6.137727054086234,6.342521466732247,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651698E-4,2.3166917872259962E-4,2.3172637963242852E-4,2.3167979521786163E-4,2.317017209623567E-4,2.3166790136863863E-4,2.3173995330228207E-4,2.316334329633868E-4,2.3166922768351223E-4,2.3190863272655828E-4,2.3374876022784916E-4,2.3166961034116833E-4,2.3188901610218265E-4,2.3191317493693819E-4,2.3180782283696818E-4,2.3168070777104284E-4,2.3176041489471826E-4,2.318694821338903E-4,2.3169266844704956E-4,2.3169182135566595E-4,2.3190026336973298E-4,2.3171503451076974E-4,2.3171538519139342E-4,2.318638245480847E-4,2.3169275202442912E-4,2.3191594687179602E-4,2.3175073223857305E-4,2.3166865950389974E-4,2.3177368817377562E-4,2.3184442884434928E-4,2.3171617111051627E-4,2.318402732457829E-4,2.319541010320959E-4,2.3216939040434867E-4,2.3175033176679234E-4,2.3168056725302087E-4,2.317641011814396E-4,2.317040965781597E-4,2.3163368018913936E-4,2.316925966956005E-4,2.3192479227141034E-4,2.3179756692385682E-4,2.3184080156982048E-4,2.3164520857154707E-4,2.3169265560915846E-4,2.316804801322818E-4,2.3175890187423538E-4,2.3179908915749498E-4,2.317519541225617E-4,2.3171522102838566E-4,2.3168105306030668E-4,2.3215572991360737E-4,2.317393506869946E-4,2.3169260250549596E-4,2.3173810963694028E-4,2.3166889653243188E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908918E-4,2.3168137831085198E-4,2.3166876428991776E-4,2.3185410485865126E-4,2.3176103280889656E-4,2.3166866744629136E-4,2.3164511419405097E-4,2.3162181971902578E-4,2.3183124250942015E-4,2.316800167268865E-4,2.317853298453747E-4,2.3185335296367423E-4,2.3174816560918497E-4,2.3169290937467274E-4,2.3164541786535963E-4,2.317046770431953E-4,2.3164529309826858E-4,2.3165744946862301E-4,2.3

{"value":"I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine. It wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic. The storyline is different and I am sure that it could have been a good movie if it was in right hands. Directing and acting were awful!! I had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of amateurs. Although the movie started promisingly, it got worse and worse. I think this is an unoriginal movie with awkward characters.. I still think that it is worth watching as I haven't seen films subjecting gay porn. Don't keep your expectations high though,then you will be very disappointed. * out of *****","finished_norm":["i","want","to","see","the","movi","becaus","of","a","articl","in","a","film","magazin","it","be","not","a","highli","recommend","on","by","the","critic","the","storylin","be","differ","and","i","be","sure","that","it","can","have","be","a","good","movi","if","it","be","in","right","hand","direct","and","act","be","aw","i","have","the","feel","of","watch","a","movi","which","be","make","a","bunch","of","amateur","although","the","movi","start","promisingli","it","get","wrong","and","wrong","i","think","thi","be","a","unorigin","movi","with","awkward","charact","i","still","think","that","it","be","worth","watch","a","i","have","not","see","film","subject","gai","porn","do","not","keep","your","expect","high","thoughthen","you","will","be","veri","disappoint","out","of"],"filtered":["want","see","movi","becaus","articl","film","magazin","highli","recommend","critic","storylin","differ","sure","good","movi","right","hand","direct","act","aw","feel","watch","movi","make","bunch","amateur","although","movi","start","promisingli","get","wrong","wrong","think","thi","unorigin","movi","awkward","charact","still","think","worth","watch","see","film","subject","gai","porn","keep","expect","high","thoughthen","veri","disappoint"],"filtered2":["want","see","becaus","articl","magazin","highli","recommend","critic","storylin","differ","sure","good","right","hand","direct","act","aw","feel","watch","make","bunch","amateur","although","start","promisingli","get","wrong","wrong","think","unorigin","awkward","charact","still","think","worth","watch","see","subject","gai","porn","keep","expect","high","thoughthen","veri","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,10,12,15,21,22,25,37,43,64,71,102,119,121,130,134,138,187,204,211,219,235,237,298,419,515,550,579,640,896,971,1158,1516,2369,2382,4791,8423],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,10,12,15,21,22,25,37,43,64,71,102,119,121,130,134,138,187,204,211,219,235,237,298,419,515,550,579,640,896,971,1158,1516,2369,2382,4791,8423],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,1.1238870241028365,2.133457220525776,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.559277576165403,1.4876543214774305,1.6608112036218214,1.883428577602134,1.9214926742550966,2.087553710177271,2.1653408989309972,2.2190595059394194,2.2642139034199635,2.2443961816702407,2.2907365189289424,2.4732161909892554,2.624524614047584,2.5687161421197025,2.5792094178355414,2.6457189377809835,2.640097787510554,2.7819920465008363,3.1758963322079246,3.3956930001684253,3.4751392270607813,3.5642670069567886,3.9998419165363233,3.8844878351953436,4.181290492043933,4.2860694432771105,4.535724120139652,5.185068678041204,5.102830579804232,6.101359409915359,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6717037937823456E-4,2.669336261981838E-4,2.6699953417250584E-4,2.669458587255896E-4,2.6697112198467926E-4,2.669321544066981E-4,2.67015174012621E-4,2.668924392557493E-4,2.6693368261187687E-4,2.6720952964782177E-4,2.693297594914966E-4,2.669341235172934E-4,2.671869270007747E-4,2.6721476326885995E-4,2.670933745790582E-4,2.669469101866907E-4,2.6703875024791E-4,2.6716441959163603E-4,2.6696069150467124E-4,2.669597154698961E-4,2.6719988631598694E-4,2.66986462107932E-4,2.6698686616880463E-4,2.671579008138558E-4,2.6696078780411475E-4,2.6721795714483115E-4,2.670275937076645E-4,2.669330279445399E-4,2.6705404397204657E-4,2.671355527157648E-4,2.6698777171973943E-4,2.671307645561984E-4,2.6726191909272405E-4,2.6750997959492046E-4,2.670271322764754E-4,2.6694674827915793E-4,2.6704299765745827E-4,2.6697385921431097E-4,2.6689272411395523E-4,2.6696060883128937E-4,2.6722814898220564E-4,2.670815575212524E-4,2.6713137330118525E-4,2.6690600733504346E-4,2.6696067671260935E-4,2.6694664789698834E-4,2.670370069169834E-4,2.6708331146775143E-4,2.6702900158559494E-4,2.6698667701707026E-4,2.6694730803553617E-4,2.6749423971813007E-4,2.6701447966784547E-4,2.669606155255612E-4,2.6701304970641035E-4,2.6693330105331483E-4,0.9789024083376444,2.669749471059819E-4,2.669476827953897E-4,2.669331486809793E-4,2.671467016031525E-4,2.6703946222035797E-4,2.669330370959143E-4,2.669058985915006E-4,2.6687905825510737E-4,2.6712035917030356E-4,2.6694611395249366E-4,2.670674577270919E-4,2.671458352554845E-4,2.670246363885535E-4,2.669609691060529E-4,2.6690624848734796E-4,2.669745280371457E-4,2.669061047283368E-4,2.6692011152906016E-4,2.6690625604146003E-4,2.6707951549918206E-4,2.6700002408825297E-4,2.6693339338281104E-4,2.6695925088617516E-4]}}
