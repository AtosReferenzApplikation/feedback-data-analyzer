{"value":"When the folks at Kino Video assembled their fine \"Slapstick Encyclopedia\" collection, a multi-cassette selection of silent comedies, someone decided to kick off the first installment with ONE TOO MANY (1916), an obscure one-reel farce made in Florida starring the very young Oliver Hardy. As enjoyable as the set is over all, this decision was an unfortunate one, for ONE TOO MANY is a very poor film which almost discourages the viewer from watching further. Like any typical farce, this one involves deception inspired by greed, panic when plans go awry, and complications escalating to the point of absurdity, but unlike the good ones, ONE TOO MANY is incoherent, unfunny, and downright annoying. It's hard to tell at this point whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing footage or inept film-making, but whatever the cause, by the halfway point even the most alert viewer has no idea what the character relationships are or what is happening, and by the end one no longer cares.<br /><br />The only point of interest here is seeing the 24 year-old \"Babe\" Hardy, who appears considerably heavier than he would a decade later when he teamed with Stan Laurel, but who is nonetheless full of youthful energy. In the opening scene, awakening with a hangover, Babe performs a highly athletic backward roll off a bed. Trust me, that's as funny as this movie gets. If you read this before seeing the first cassette of Kino's \"Slapstick Encyclopedia\" I suggest you fast-forward past this one and skip to the good stuff.","finished_norm":["when","the","folk","at","kino","video","assembl","their","fine","slapstick","encyclopedia","collect","a","multicassett","select","of","silent","comedi","someon","decid","to","kick","off","the","instal","with","on","too","mani","a","obscur","onereel","farc","make","in","florida","star","the","veri","young","oliv","hardi","a","enjoy","a","the","set","be","over","all","thi","decis","be","a","unfortun","on","for","on","too","mani","be","a","veri","poor","film","which","almost","discourag","the","viewer","from","watch","far","like","ani","typic","farc","thi","on","involv","decept","inspir","by","gre","panic","when","plan","go","awri","and","complic","escal","to","the","point","of","absurd","but","unlik","the","good","on","on","too","mani","be","incoher","unfunni","and","downright","annoi","it","hard","to","tell","at","thi","point","whether","the","hopelessli","confus","plot","be","the","result","of","miss","footag","or","inept","filmmak","but","whatev","the","caus","by","the","halfwai","point","even","the","much","alert","viewer","have","no","idea","what","the","charact","relationship","be","or","what","be","happen","and","by","the","end","on","no","long","caresbr","br","the","onli","point","of","interest","here","be","see","the","yearold","babe","hardi","who","appear","consider","heavi","than","he","would","a","decad","late","when","he","team","with","stan","laurel","but","who","be","nonetheless","full","of","youth","energi","in","the","open","scene","awaken","with","a","hangov","babe","perform","a","highli","athlet","backward","roll","off","a","bed","trust","me","that","a","funni","a","thi","movi","get","if","you","read","thi","befor","see","the","cassett","of","kino","slapstick","encyclopedia","i","suggest","you","fastforward","past","thi","on","and","skip","to","the","good","stuff"],"filtered":["folk","kino","video","assembl","fine","slapstick","encyclopedia","collect","multicassett","select","silent","comedi","someon","decid","kick","instal","mani","obscur","onereel","farc","make","florida","star","veri","young","oliv","hardi","enjoy","set","thi","decis","unfortun","mani","veri","poor","film","almost","discourag","viewer","watch","far","like","ani","typic","farc","thi","involv","decept","inspir","gre","panic","plan","go","awri","complic","escal","point","absurd","unlik","good","mani","incoher","unfunni","downright","annoi","hard","tell","thi","point","whether","hopelessli","confus","plot","result","miss","footag","inept","filmmak","whatev","caus","halfwai","point","even","much","alert","viewer","idea","charact","relationship","happen","end","long","caresbr","br","onli","point","interest","see","yearold","babe","hardi","appear","consider","heavi","decad","late","team","stan","laurel","nonetheless","full","youth","energi","open","scene","awaken","hangov","babe","perform","highli","athlet","backward","roll","bed","trust","funni","thi","movi","get","read","thi","befor","see","cassett","kino","slapstick","encyclopedia","suggest","fastforward","past","thi","skip","good","stuff"],"filtered2":["folk","kino","video","assembl","fine","slapstick","encyclopedia","collect","multicassett","select","silent","comedi","someon","decid","kick","instal","mani","obscur","onereel","farc","make","florida","star","veri","young","oliv","hardi","enjoy","set","decis","unfortun","mani","veri","poor","almost","discourag","viewer","watch","far","like","ani","typic","farc","involv","decept","inspir","gre","panic","plan","go","awri","complic","escal","point","absurd","unlik","good","mani","incoher","unfunni","downright","annoi","hard","tell","point","whether","hopelessli","confus","plot","result","miss","footag","inept","filmmak","whatev","caus","halfwai","point","even","alert","viewer","idea","charact","relationship","happen","end","long","caresbr","onli","point","interest","see","yearold","babe","hardi","appear","consider","heavi","decad","late","team","stan","laurel","nonetheless","full","youth","energi","open","scene","awaken","hangov","babe","perform","highli","athlet","backward","roll","bed","trust","funni","get","read","befor","see","cassett","kino","slapstick","encyclopedia","suggest","fastforward","past","skip","good","stuff"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,11,15,19,24,27,32,50,60,62,66,79,90,94,99,100,101,105,109,123,127,131,135,139,145,146,150,169,171,227,240,241,242,249,255,271,279,323,336,361,427,440,447,453,464,556,577,581,597,613,615,646,658,723,736,795,869,896,909,928,931,948,1005,1026,1065,1177,1196,1225,1290,1373,1396,1414,1483,1537,1556,1640,1646,1981,1996,2085,2088,2103,2117,2164,2277,2431,2491,2610,2639,2871,3006,3151,3258,3486,3646,4129,4407,4485,4692,4814,5012,5370,7230,8040,8216,8324],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"Beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a Chinese factory, Manufactured Landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. Its droning narrative assumes that industrial development in China and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in Europe and America and Karl Marx had never visited the British Museum. That there might be a connection between the present-day Asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never mentioned.<br /><br />At the same time, there's an effort to present Edward Burtynsky's photographs of industrial waste as somehow \"beautiful\". Much of the film is a slide show of these images. They are well produced, of museum size, and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions. To me, however, they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented. Industrial waste is still industrial waste. The relationship, if any, between the photographs and the film's spoken message remains unclear.<br /><br />I don't mean to imply that there aren't real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize. Manufactured Landscapes, however, offers only strange and bitter hopelessness. It's like a two-hour lecture by Noam Chomsky. Maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what's wrong with the American (and Canadian) Left.","finished_norm":["begin","with","it","long","open","shoot","of","seemingli","endless","row","of","assembli","line","worker","in","a","chines","factori","manufactur","landscap","attempt","to","show","the","devast","impact","of","industri","on","the","natur","environ","and","tradit","societi","it","drone","narr","assum","that","industri","develop","in","china","and","elsewher","be","entir","unpreced","a","if","there","have","never","be","a","industri","revolut","in","europ","and","america","and","karl","marx","have","never","visit","the","british","museum","that","there","mai","be","a","connect","between","the","presentdai","asian","drive","for","industri","and","wealth","and","earli","experi","of","starvat","and","terror","be","never","mentionedbr","br","at","the","same","time","there","a","effort","to","present","edward","burtynski","photograph","of","industri","wast","a","somehow","beauti","much","of","the","film","be","a","slide","show","of","thi","imag","thei","be","good","produc","of","museum","size","and","have","appar","appear","in","sever","exhibit","to","me","howev","thei","onli","demonstr","that","almost","ani","photograph","can","be","make","to","appear","beauti","if","good","present","industri","wast","be","still","industri","wast","the","relationship","if","ani","between","the","photograph","and","the","film","speak","messag","remain","unclearbr","br","i","do","not","mean","to","impli","that","there","be","not","real","and","sometim","desper","problem","when","countri","rush","to","industri","manufactur","landscap","howev","offer","onli","strang","and","bitter","hopeless","it","like","a","twohour","lectur","by","noam","chomski","mayb","it","have","some","valu","a","a","demonstr","of","what","wrong","with","the","american","and","canadian","leav"],"filtered":["begin","long","open","shoot","seemingli","endless","row","assembli","line","worker","chines","factori","manufactur","landscap","attempt","show","devast","impact","industri","natur","environ","tradit","societi","drone","narr","assum","industri","develop","china","elsewher","entir","unpreced","never","industri","revolut","europ","america","karl","marx","never","visit","british","museum","mai","connect","presentdai","asian","drive","industri","wealth","earli","experi","starvat","terror","never","mentionedbr","br","time","effort","present","edward","burtynski","photograph","industri","wast","somehow","beauti","much","film","slide","show","thi","imag","thei","good","produc","museum","size","appar","appear","sever","exhibit","howev","thei","onli","demonstr","almost","ani","photograph","make","appear","beauti","good","present","industri","wast","still","industri","wast","relationship","ani","photograph","film","speak","messag","remain","unclearbr","br","mean","impli","real","sometim","desper","problem","countri","rush","industri","manufactur","landscap","howev","offer","onli","strang","bitter","hopeless","like","twohour","lectur","noam","chomski","mayb","valu","demonstr","wrong","american","canadian","leav"],"filtered2":["begin","long","open","shoot","seemingli","endless","row","assembli","line","worker","chines","factori","manufactur","landscap","attempt","show","devast","impact","industri","natur","environ","tradit","societi","drone","narr","assum","industri","develop","china","elsewher","entir","unpreced","never","industri","revolut","europ","america","karl","marx","never","visit","british","museum","mai","connect","presentdai","asian","drive","industri","wealth","earli","experi","starvat","terror","never","mentionedbr","time","effort","present","edward","burtynski","photograph","industri","wast","somehow","beauti","slide","show","imag","good","produc","museum","size","appar","appear","sever","exhibit","howev","onli","demonstr","almost","ani","photograph","make","appear","beauti","good","present","industri","wast","still","industri","wast","relationship","ani","photograph","speak","messag","remain","unclearbr","mean","impli","real","sometim","desper","problem","countri","rush","industri","manufactur","landscap","howev","offer","onli","strang","bitter","hopeless","like","twohour","lectur","noam","chomski","mayb","valu","demonstr","wrong","american","canadian","leav"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,8,11,25,27,28,42,46,64,74,80,88,89,99,107,113,117,131,147,163,167,169,177,198,223,242,261,266,308,316,320,325,333,344,401,411,417,451,456,461,500,507,549,569,577,608,682,696,740,767,788,809,920,1049,1083,1167,1198,1207,1313,1321,1363,1421,1448,1449,1671,1796,1815,1884,2045,2183,2203,2285,2352,2422,2465,2602,2613,2880,2886,2940,2997,3289,3317,3371,3426,3618,3957,4284,4988,5470,6469,6798],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"This is an interesting treatment of a subject that is quite controversial, (just read the other comments on this film). Apparently, you either love it or hate it and it seems most people make that distinction based on whether they believe the tribulation and end times will happen as portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />Basically, the film - and its sequels - were made for about $1.30 each. The production values are right down there with \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" and the acting is about on the same level as \"Glen or Glenda\", (my apologies to Ed Wood). Putting aside the religious message, the story is as scary as they come. Add in even the slightest thought that the story might actually be close to something that might happen in the future and it becomes even scarier.<br /><br />This movie, and its sequels, didn't try to bring in the reasons why the tribulation happened when it did. \"Left Behind\" and \"The Omega Code\" tried to get in everything \"Thief\" did and to explain all the politics and maneuvering in the Middle East leading up to it. The net effect was \"Thief\" did a much better job on the scary part of movie, instead of spreading itself too thin trying to explain what was happening in the Middle East at the same time. <br /><br />Forget the politics and watch this movie, and its sequels, for what they are - horror stories.

{"value":"... just look at the poor Robert Webber character (great performance, once again!) who tries to wrestle a sub machine gun from one of the terrorists. Everything in this movie seems to be a little wrong. The biggest mistake in my opinion is the effort to give the action a firm footing in the actuality of the early 1980ies (the fundamental difference between this flick and the far more fantastic, ironic and therefore timeless Die Hard). The story comes through as a failed attempt to glorify the SAS commandos. Ideas like when a commando shouts heads down\" all good guys do it and all bad guys don't so that they can blast away ad lib (with a good conscience), that the main character does not get mown down by the gas masked commandos although he wears the same clothes and carries a weapon from their arsenal just seem to be unlikely and make it hard to take the movie seriously. And it just happens that it tries to be more than just fun. Don't talk about the toilet-mirror-signal episode ...<br /><br />I don't mind the criticism of the Pacifist movement as a shield for evildoers and the arguments between the peace fanatics and the settled, even headed representatives of power in this movie. But the political comment is rather lame and uninspired. This is insofar regrettable as the movie features an early performance of Judy Davies. She plays the main fanatic and seems to have done extensive studies on the subject\". Anyway, her performance is a notch above that of the others and somehow I feel the movie let her

{"value":"You know, I went to see \"The Hills have eyes 2\" wanting to like it. I really enjoyed the original, and the remake was fairly entertaining. They obviously had more money to throw around than Wes Craven did on special effects the second time around. Even though I still prefer the original film, the remake was done well, and it was kind of a guilty pleasure for me. Bloody, intense, and great special effects. In short, a great popcorn movie for any horror fan.<br /><br />Which brings us to \"The Hills have eyes 2\". Man, where do I start? The plot, or lack of one, is paper thin. We are not exactly breaking new ground here.The military has decided to monitor the area, and all of these people turn up missing. So what do we do now? Let's send in the National Guard to investigate. In true Hollywood fashion we need to make them the dumbest, and worst soldiers ever seen. Gee, I've never seen that premise before. To make a long story short, you have the mutants killing off the moron soldiers one at a time in graphic fashion. Once again the special effects by Nicotero are great, but the kills no matter how graphic become boring, and predictable. Honestly it seemed to me that this flick was done just to grab a quick buck. It was bloody, and graphic, but I found it predictable, boring, and not scary at all. For me it would have been nice if this film contained one original thought.Wes Craven and his son shared the writing duties, and he has been involved with many of my favorite horror films, but sadly this isn't one of them.","finished_norm":["you","know","i","go","to","see","the","hill","have","ey","want","to","like","it","i","realli","enjoi","the","origin","and","the","remak","be","fairli","entertain","thei","obvious","have","much","monei","to","throw","around","than","we","craven","do","on","special","effect","the","time","around","even","though","i","still","prefer","the","origin","film","the","remak","be","do","good","and","it","be","kind","of","a","guilti","pleasur","for","me","bloodi","intens","and","great","special","effect","in","short","a","great","popcorn","movi","for","ani","horror","fanbr","br","which","bring","u","to","the","hill","have","ey","man","where","do","i","start","the","plot","or","lack","of","on","be","paper","thin","we","be","not","exactli","break","new","grind","hereth","militari","have","decid","to","monitor","the","area","and","all","of","thi","peopl","turn","up","miss","so","what","do","we","do","now","let","send","in","the","nation","guard","to","investig","in","true","hollywood","fashion","we","ne","to","make","them","the","dumb","and","wrong","soldier","ever","see","gee","i","have","never","see","that","premis","befor","to","make","a","long","stori","short","you","have","the","mutant","kill","off","the","moron","soldier","on","at","a","time","in","graphic","fashion","onc","again","the","special","effect","by","nicotero","be","great","but","the","kill","no","matt","how","graphic","becom","bore","and","predict","honestli","it","seem","to","me","that","thi","flick","be","do","just","to","grab","a","quick","buck","it","be","bloodi","and","graphic","but","i","find","it","predict","bore","and","not","scari","at","all","for","me","it","would","have","be","nice","if","thi","film","contain","on","origin","thoughtw","craven","and","hi","son","share","the","write","duti","and","he","have","be","involv","with","mani","of","my","favorit","horror","film","but","sadli","thi","be","not","on","of","them"],"filtered":["know","go","see","hill","ey","want","like","realli","enjoi","origin","remak","fairli","entertain","thei","obvious","much","monei","throw","around","craven","special","effect","time","around","even","though","still","prefer","origin","film","remak","good","kind","guilti","pleasur","bloodi","intens","great","special","effect","short","great","popcorn","movi","ani","horror","fanbr","br","bring","u","hill","ey","man","start","plot","lack","paper","thin","exactli","break","new","grind","hereth","militari","decid","monitor","area","thi","peopl","turn","miss","let","send","nation","guard","investig","true","hollywood","fashion","ne","make","dumb","wrong","soldier","ever","see","gee","never","see","premis","befor","make","long","stori","short","mutant","kill","moron","soldier","time","graphic","fashion","onc","special","effect","nicotero","great","kill","matt","graphic","becom","bore","predict","honestli","seem","thi","flick","grab","quick","buck","bloodi","graphic","find","predict","bore","scari","nice","thi","film","contain","origin","thoughtw","craven","hi","son","share","write","duti","involv","mani","favorit","horror","film","sadli","thi"],"filtered2":["know","go","see","hill","ey","want","like","realli","enjoi","origin","remak","fairli","entertain","obvious","monei","throw","around","craven","special","effect","time","around","even","though","still","prefer","origin","remak","good","kind","guilti","pleasur","bloodi","intens","great","special","effect","short","great","popcorn","ani","horror","fanbr","bring","u","hill","ey","man","start","plot","lack","paper","thin","exactli","break","new","grind","hereth","militari","decid","monitor","area","peopl","turn","miss","let","send","nation","guard","investig","true","hollywood","fashion","ne","make","dumb","wrong","soldier","ever","see","gee","never","see","premis","befor","make","long","stori","short","mutant","kill","moron","soldier","time","graphic","fashion","onc","special","effect","nicotero","great","kill","matt","graphic","becom","bore","predict","honestli","seem","flick","grab","quick","buck","bloodi","graphic","find","predict","bore","scari","nice","contain","origin","thoughtw","craven","son","share","write","duti","involv","mani","favorit","horror","sadli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,8,13,17,23,25,26,27,32,35,37,38,42,44,45,50,51,64,65,69,71,76,79,83,86,87,96,98,99,106,108,110,112,115,122,124,126,183,195,200,203,236,241,249,250,255,257,262,272,281,300,304,310,337,341,360,396,408,420,434,462,483,484,657,705,711,721,757,819,822,980,984,1018,1037,1055,1064,1113,1124,1146,1156,1173,1179,1268,1350,1387,1399,1407,1550,1591,1638,2038,2309,2765,2984,3262,4345,5100],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,

{"value":"Ah yez, the Sci Fi Channel produces Yeti another abominable movie. I was particularly taken by the scenes immediately following the crash where, as the survivors desperately searched for matches, at least a half dozen fires burned  with no apparent reason  at various points of the wreckage. Fire seemed to be a predominate theme throughout. They searched corpses for lighters and matches, and finally finding a box built a fire every day for, apparently, 12, but no one ever gathered wood. Then when the vegan (hah) burned the bodies, what did she use for an accelerant? I mean these guys were frozen  well maybe not. Despite the apparent low temperature everything the yeti ate, bled. Maybe it's just me, but even in a totally unbelievable tale (none of the survivors had ever heard of a yeti, or an abominable snowman, until the very end), if you take care of the little things the bigger deals become more acceptable. Oh, what did the prologue (1972) have to do with the remainder of the movie? And the revolver, warm enough to hold in his hand, froze up and wouldn't fire. Gimme a break. Well, at least we have Carly Pope, another eminently lovely Canadian lass. And, with little irony, Ed Marinaro as the coach.<br /><br />Well I might as well add, the rabbit they ate (despite it looking like chicken) is not a rodent, but a lagomorph.

{"value":"Recently, I saw the documentary \"The revolution will not be televised\", also know as \"Chávez: inside the coup\". At first I thought it showed a genuine inside view of events during the Venezuela coup of April 2002. What bothered me though was the fact that the tone of the narration and the accompanying music were suggestive, and that at no point any criticism was expressed about Hugo Chávez. This is peculiar because if a documentary is giving an non-biased account of what happened, there should have been some of that too. After all, Chávez certainly is not a saint. Fortunately, since the documentary is several years old, a lot of additional information is available on the internet nowadays, and it was not difficult to find for instance \"Urgent Investigation about Chavez-the coup by the 5 European TV Corporations who financed the film which presents blatant falsehoods about Venezuela.\" It lists the many errors and intended or unintended falsifications in the documentary. (Just use the title as a search string in Google, you will find it). Another interesting document was the video registration of a presentation of the findings of the many errors in this documentary, \"X-ray of a lie\". To me it seems to be a good counterweight to \"Chávez: inside the coup\" It's available at video.google. I strongly advice you after watching \"Chávez: inside the coup\" to look at \"X-ray of a lie\" and then form your opinion. My conclusion is that Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Brian were (knowingly or not) part in

{"value":"Vampires Vs. Zombies wasn't the original title. It was actually... <br /><br />Nasty Lesbian Semi-Vampires and Two Zombies Getting Hit by Cars: Special Guest appearances by Bob the Lesbian Gypsie-Witch and her dog, Random Woman with special powers and the Catholic School Girl Short Skirt Zombie Choir. <br /><br />Also on the Box: Warning: No Plot- only the writer and director will understand the end, or anything else in this movie.<br /><br />Seriously though, I love bad movies. I love Vampires. I love Zombies. Hell, I even enjoy the lesbians. This movie combined all three with a vague and confusing (or non-existent) plot, horrendous (I mean REALLY BAD) dialogue, and random STUFF and PEOPLE that have nothing to do with anything (or do they... I didn't know what in the world was going on). Oh, and I can't forget the green oatmeal 'Zombies' in latex gloves (yes, the film makers were so cheap they couldn't even cover their Zombies hands in oatmeal and paint). Any way, the result was this excruciatingly BAD film, if you could even call it that. <br /><br />Was the end supposed to not make sense? The Vampire was really Nurse and the other girl was really a mental patient? Where were the Vampires Vs. Zombies? Hell, where were the Vampires at all... you really couldn't call any of the girls vampires. Whatever. <br /><br />Don't ever rent or buy this movie. If you are REALLY curious... okay, I'll understand. Seriously, even lovers of BAD movies won't be able to stand this one.

{"value":"This is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic, genre defining MASTERPIECE, Jaws. Yes, brainiac, great whites(and other species of shark, bull, black-tip, oceanic white-tip, tiger)have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found. Humans don't often make it onto that menu, granted, but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior. It's not like it's never happened. The odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town, singling out a human nemesis, sinking several dozen thick hulled North Atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people, all friends of the aforementioned \"nemesis\", are close enough to the water for it to reach, are so slim as to be laughable. Much like this turd of a Jaws knock-off. Laughable. Great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards, as they look like seals from below. A shark the size of Bruce(if you don't know, look it up)would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca(hey! that's the name of the blatant rip-off we're discussing!), as it would weigh upwards of 6,000 lbs. I could go on, but I don't need to. Jaws is amazing(better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), Orca is crap(BLATANT rip-off of Jaws, lousy writing, abominable effects, most ridiculous plot this side of an Olson Twins flick). It doesn't take a masters from Columbia University to see that.

{"value":"Charles Bronson continued his 80's slump with what could possibly be his worst movie of the decade, if not ever. In it he plays a detective who goes to great lengths to track down a pimp who has abducted an Asian girl and is currently selling her to the highest bidder. It's a shameful attempt at action and is quite possibly the most depressing movie ever made. A lot of people consider the Death Wish sequels to be Bronson's worst movies. The Death Wish sequels weren't great movies but were in most cases competently made and very watchable. Kinjite however is an utterly dull thriller which is punctuated by mean spirited racism and child molestation. It really is a rephrensible film and all of it is made worse by the fact that it tries to preach a \"Law and Justice\" mentality that is too overwrought to really say anything. Indeed the movie begins with underage sex being interrupted with Bronson then anally raping the pedophile with a dildo. The Chicago theater I watched this in just gasped at the awkwardness of this scene, only to gasp at the awkwardness of the pimp raping the girl in this film. It has no point other than to exploit and really the movie wasn't well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would work. Bronson seems more into things but clearly this is far too repugnant to save. I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever but this effort is ultimately his worst.

{"value":"It's hard to believe, after waiting 14 years, we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage. The original was a high impact, dark thriller that achieved \"cult\" status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by Paul Verhoeven. This film adds nothing, delivers nothing, and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels.<br /><br />The opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast. Unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self-indulgent life of Catherine Tramell... or is it Sharon Stone. Possibly a copulation of both.<br /><br />If the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in \"B.S.1\", forget it. You wind up with soft-porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them. It's interesting to note that the wonderful Charlotte Rampling was romping around in her skivvies, via the 1966 GEORGY GIRL, when Ms. Stone was only 8 years old. A very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here.<br /><br />If you're a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system. If not, you might as well wait for the DVD release in the \"rated\" version, \"unrated\" version, \"collectors\" edition, or \"ultimate\" version, and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of \"Basic Instinct 3\" at which point Ms. Stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really

{"value":"This movie was so badly written, directed and acted that it beggars belief. It should be remade with a better script, director and casting service. The worst problem is the acting. You have Jennifer Beals on the one hand who is polished, professional and totally believable, and on the other hand, Ri'chard, who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece. Peter Gallagher and Jenny Levine are just awful as the slave owning (and keeping) couple, although both normally do fine work. The actors (and director) should not have attempted to do accents at all--they are inconsistent and unbelievable. Much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual English. The casting is ludicrous. Why have children of an \"African\" merchant (thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society ) been cast with very pale skinned actors, while the supposedly socially desirable Marcel, has pronounced African features, including an obviously dyed blond \"fro\"? It's as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color. It's just so weird! This could be a great movie and should be re-made, but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors. There are plenty of good actors out there, and it would be fun to see how Jennifer Beals, Daniel Sunjata and Gloria Reuben would do with an appropriate cast, good script and decent direction.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","so","badli","write","direct","and","act","that","it","beggar","belief","it","should","be","remak","with","a","well","script","director","and","cast","servic","the","wrong","problem","be","the","act","you","have","jennif","beal","on","the","on","hand","who","be","polish","profession","and","total","believ","and","on","the","other","hand","ri","chard","who","be","woefulli","miscast","and","just","jar","in","thi","particular","piec","peter","gallagh","and","jenni","levin","be","just","aw","a","the","slave","own","and","keep","coupl","although","both","normal","do","fine","work","the","actor","and","director","should","not","have","attempt","to","do","accent","at","allthei","be","inconsist","and","unbeliev","much","well","to","have","concentr","on","do","a","good","job","in","actual","english","the","cast","be","ludicr","why","have","child","of","a","african","merchant","thu","littl","social","desir","to","the","gen","de","couleur","societi","be","cast","with","veri","pale","skin","actor","while","the","supposedli","social","desir","marcel","have","pronounc","african","featur","includ","a","obvious","dye","blond","fro","it","a","if","the","cast","director","cannot","be","bother","to","read","the","script","thei","be","cast","and","to","choos","appropri","actor","from","a","larg","pool","of","extrem","talent","and","physic","divers","actor","of","color","it","just","so","weird","thi","can","be","a","great","movi","and","should","be","remak","but","with","peopl","who","respect","the","materi","and","can","choos","appropri","and","skill","actor","there","be","plenti","of","good","actor","out","there","and","it","would","be","fun","to","see","how","jennif","beal","daniel","sunjata","and","gloria","reuben","would","do","with","a","appropri","cast","good","script","and","decent","direct"],"filtered":["thi","movi","badli","write","direct","act","beggar","belief","remak","well","script","director","cast","servic","wrong","problem","act","jennif","beal","hand","polish","profession","total","believ","hand","ri","chard","woefulli","miscast","jar","thi","particular","piec","peter","gallagh","jenni","levin","aw","slave","keep","coupl","although","normal","fine","work","actor","director","attempt","accent","allthei","inconsist","unbeliev","much","well","concentr","good","job","actual","english","cast","ludicr","child","african","merchant","thu","littl","social","desir","gen","de","couleur","societi","cast","veri","pale","skin","actor","supposedli","social","desir","marcel","pronounc","african","featur","includ","obvious","dye","blond","fro","cast","director","bother","read","script","thei","cast","choos","appropri","actor","larg","pool","extrem","talent","physic","divers","actor","color","weird","thi","great","movi","remak","peopl","respect","materi","choos","appropri","skill","actor","plenti","good","actor","fun","see","jennif","beal","daniel","sunjata","gloria","reuben","appropri","cast","good","script","decent","direct"],"filtered2":["badli","write","direct","act","beggar","belief","remak","well","script","director","cast","servic","wrong","problem","act","jennif","beal","hand","polish","profession","total","believ","hand","ri","chard","woefulli","miscast","jar","particular","piec","peter","gallagh","jenni","levin","aw","slave","keep","coupl","although","normal","fine","work","actor","director","attempt","accent","allthei","inconsist","unbeliev","well","concentr","good","job","actual","english","cast","ludicr","child","african","merchant","thu","littl","social","desir","gen","de","couleur","societi","cast","veri","pale","skin","actor","supposedli","social","desir","marcel","pronounc","african","featur","includ","obvious","dye","blond","fro","cast","director","bother","read","script","cast","choos","appropri","actor","larg","pool","extrem","talent","physic","divers","actor","color","weird","great","remak","peopl","respect","materi","choos","appropri","skill","actor","plenti","good","actor","fun","see","jennif","beal","daniel","sunjata","gloria","reuben","appropri","cast","good","script","decent","direct"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,14,15,20,21,23,25,41,48,51,52,58,65,77,91,92,102,134,138,145,167,177,180,184,218,235,237,253,259,276,289,301,305,309,329,341,448,464,483,496,537,559,564,571,584,588,625,695,700,750,760,832,875,887,946,970,975,976,985,1049,1160,1182,1192,1230,1394,1512,1541,1578,1617,1632,1750,1877,2138,2270,2362,2385,2506,2732,3110,3534,3632,3856,4164,4464,5696,5880,7334],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,14,15,20,21,23,25,41,48,51,52,58,65,77,91,92,102,134,138,145,167,1

{"value":"\"Back of Beyond\" takes place at a dive diner/gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. We get what, at first, confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister (though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle. Afterwards, he appears as a terribly quiet, and sometimes, moody character in the presence of the arrivals.<br /><br />We know one thing is for sure and that is McGregor's sort of spiritual sense, his foresight of danger and such--his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on Tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other. But not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie all the while seems to want to build up to something significant, but really fails to do so. Even the ending, of which plays out like a trite campfire tale (and one that really reveals a lot of narrative flaws), is almost just as ridiculous.<br /><br />It may be worth trying if you don't mind

{"value":"I saw this movie when I was really little. It is, by far, one of the strangest movies I have ever seen. Now, normally, I like weird movies, but this was just a bit too much.<br /><br />There's not much of a plot to the movie. If anything, it starts out like Toy Story, where toys come to life, and Raggedy Ann and Andy go on an adventure to rescue their new friend, Babette. From there, craziness ensues. There's the Greedy, the Looneys, a sea monster named Gazooks, and a bunch of pirates singing show tunes, all of which just made the movie weirder. Also, I can't help but feel that Babette is annoying and a bit too whiny. She definitely didn't help the movie.<br /><br />Now, even though I didn't like this movie, there were a few cute parts. I liked the camel's song. Even though it was a song about being lonely, it had a friendly feel to it. Then, there was Sir Leonard. While most of the Looneys were just plain nuts, Sir Leonard was the most interesting and probably the funniest. King Koo Koo was just a little dirtbag that made Dr. Evil look like a serious villain. Also, there was Raggedy Andy's song, No Girl's Toy. It was definitely good song for little boys who wanted to act tough. But, honestly, even these things didn't make the movie any better. (But remember, this is just my perspective.) <br /><br />While I personally wouldn't recommend this movie, even I have to admit, it does have its charming moments. See it if you're interested, but only if you're in the mood for something \"really\" out of the

{"value":"The poster who called this \"Plotless and pointless\" literally took the words I would have used in my subject line. The only thing I'd add is \"passionless.\" For a film made by a real life married couple and featuring lots of graphic sex scenes this movie manages to make what should be a sultry situation into one beyond ice cold. Dafoe and Colagrande look bored during the sex scenes, and the viewer might as well take a Valium and have done with it. Also, please, the women in the audience have seen WAY too many used tampons in their time, and any guy who is turned on by seeing Willem Dafoe pull a bloody tampon out of his wife's vagina really needs to get therapy.<br /><br />I think the key to the film (if there is one) is the restaurant scene where a waiter explains to the perpetually sleepy-eyed Dafoe what a \"deconstructed jambalaya\" is. (All the ingredients of the dish still separate rather than simmered together.) This movie is a \"deconstructed thriller\". All the elements are there: spooky, isolated house, dead spouse,creepy violins on the score, weirdo caretaker who comes and goes as he pleases, auto accident deaths and near deaths, characters with a secret past. Basically every thriller cliché you can think of, but NOTHING comes together. Everything just sits there and never meshes into a coherent plot or even an artsy mood piece. At the restaurant, Dafoe passes on the \"deconstructed jambalaya\".

{"value":"I just watched this movie and I've gotta say that with such a great premise and great talent this turkey just lays there!!! A friend lent me this movie and I watched with an open mind mainly because he had such high praise for the story. <br /><br />Well, the movie started off with Kevin Costner as a fighter pilot retiring... why? Why did they make him a fighter pilot? He was supposedly going to be hired by Anthony Quinn's character to be his new pilot... well, we never see Costner go near a plane for the rest of the movie! <br /><br />Costner runs into a Texan (James Gammon) selling a horse to a big Mexican businessman and Costner tags along for a ride. Without knowing what happened, Gammon is beat to near death and Costner drives him to the meeting, which happens to be with an associate of Quinn! But, nothing comes of it... nada, zilcho! Why did they have Gammon's character? Why did they have the horse sale with the Quinn associate if nothing was to come of it? <br /><br />Also, after they leave Costner for dead, they make Madeline Stowe's character become a whore, then she attacks one of Quinn's men that was paying for a turn... she stabs him with his own knife, and the next thing she's been moved to a convent! No explanation as to why she was moved, or when it was done!<br /><br />Too much talent wasted on such a weak script and poor editing!!

{"value":"The Marquis De Sade, Egypt, ancient Gnostic cults, Robert Englund in a dual role, gratuitous sex and nudity, murder and mayhem... on paper Tobe Hopper's Night Terrors sounds like it should be at least a fun, entertaining flick given the ingredients. It's not. It is a plot less, incoherent shambles that brings little entertainment. There is basically no plot beyond some vague stuff about a cult that follows the work of De Sade who for some unclear reason feel the need to seduce the daughter of a local Christian archaeologist and kill her. That is pretty much it- I think it has something to with the Gnostics but who knows what the writers were thinking. Most of the movie is a meandering mess as the heroine is exposed to various weirdness, dream sequences and erotic encounters, intercut with scenes of Englund as the imprisoned De Sade in the 19th century chewing the scenery. It seems like the makers were trying for something serious but whatever their pretensions were they are buried in the cheesiness, bad acting, sleaze and fake looking decapitated heads.<br /><br />There aren't too many good points. Robert Englund is fun to watch, as always and the lead actress, Zoe Trilling, whilst not very talented, is attractive and in various stages of undress through the movie but watching Night Terrors is a chore. At least I got to see the movie from which the \"When you're as criminal as I\" bit from the Australian film certification ratings guide that was on the front of so many VHS tapes from the nineties

{"value":"Shecky, is a god damned legend, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to tortu^^^^^ test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.<br /><br />Now, as to why this film is so bad, where do I begin?<br /><br />Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, must have been having one hell of an off day. The rest of the crew stank, and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the worst movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute zero.<br /><br />I would have been inclined to give this a zero if I could, because they didn't even have the guts to call it by it's full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. Even so it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come, and just how low he can go.","finished_norm":["shecki","be","a","god","damn","legend","make","no","mistak","until","recent","i","work","for","a","uk","hifi","video","retail","chain","run","their","test","depart","we","would","go","through","mani","new","starter","thei","would","be","expect","to","to","learn","how","to","fault","find","the","variou","detritu","that","return","a","non","function","in","on","wai","or","anoth","from","the","store","now","to","tortu","test","the","resolv","of","thi","new","staff","member","we","would","issu","them","with","a","copi","of","go","overboard","we","have","hundr","of","copi","of","thi","film","becaus","whenev","someon","who","have","bui","a","particular","model","of","goodman","dvd","player","that","have","thi","film","a","a","free","gift","get","round","to","send","their","dvd","player","back","thei","never","fail","to","send","shecki","back","conjur","our","new","staff","would","be","forc","to","us","onli","go","overboard","to","test","thi","machin","for","fault","until","thei","have","find","a","disc","or","two","of","their","own","to","test","withbr","br","now","a","to","why","thi","film","be","so","bad","where","do","i","beginbr","br","adam","sandler","who","can","be","so","so","veri","funni","a","in","happi","gilmor","or","the","wed","singer","must","have","be","have","on","hell","of","a","off","dai","the","rest","of","the","crow","stink","and","what","be","it","with","billi","zane","hi","name","crop","up","in","sever","of","the","wrong","movi","of","all","time","and","he","be","a","decent","actor","crazi","the","product","qualiti","be","absolut","zerobr","br","i","would","have","be","inclin","to","give","thi","a","zero","if","i","can","becaus","thei","do","not","even","have","the","gut","to","call","it","by","it","full","name","the","unsink","shecki","moskowitz","on","releas","even","so","it","be","worth","a","watch","so","you","can","see","just","how","far","sandler","have","come","and","just","how","low","he","can","go"],"filtered":["shecki","god","damn","legend","make","mistak","recent","work","uk","hifi","video","retail","chain","run","test","depart","go","mani","new","starter","thei","expect","learn","fault","find","variou","detritu","return","non","function","wai","anoth","store","tortu","test","resolv","thi","new","staff","member","issu","copi","go","overboard","hundr","copi","thi","film","becaus","whenev","someon","bui","particular","model","goodman","dvd","player","thi","film","free","gift","get","round","send","dvd","player","back","thei","never","fail","send","shecki","back","conjur","new","staff","forc","us","onli","go","overboard","test","thi","machin","fault","thei","find","disc","two","test","withbr","br","thi","film","bad","beginbr","br","adam","sandler","veri","funni","happi","gilmor","wed","singer","must","hell","dai","rest","crow","stink","billi","zane","hi","name","crop","sever","wrong","movi","time","decent","actor","crazi","product","qualiti","absolut","zerobr","br","inclin","give","thi","zero","becaus","thei","even","gut","call","full","name","unsink","shecki","moskowitz","releas","even","worth","watch","see","far","sandler","come","low","go"],"filtered2":["shecki","god","damn","legend","make","mistak","recent","work","uk","hifi","video","retail","chain","run","test","depart","go","mani","new","starter","expect","learn","fault","find","variou","detritu","return","non","function","wai","anoth","store","tortu","test","resolv","new","staff","member","issu","copi","go","overboard","hundr","copi","becaus","whenev","someon","bui","particular","model","goodman","dvd","player","free","gift","get","round","send","dvd","player","back","never","fail","send","shecki","back","conjur","new","staff","forc","us","onli","go","overboard","test","machin","fault","find","disc","two","test","withbr","bad","beginbr","adam","sandler","veri","funni","happi","gilmor","wed","singer","must","hell","dai","rest","crow","stink","billi","zane","name","crop","sever","wrong","time","decent","actor","crazi","product","qualiti","absolut","zerobr","inclin","give","zero","becaus","even","gut","call","full","name","unsink","shecki","moskowitz","releas","even","worth","watch","see","far","sandler","come","low","go"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,15,22,25,30,33,34,38,39,41,42,47,48,50,56,62,63,73,87,101,130,132,137,139,141,142,143,190,215,217,219,222,226,240,247,309,316,319,327,336,338,347,352,394,430,488,562,593,605,618,686,712,721,747,769,793,806,832,889,942,964,999,1071,1102,1251,1284,1298,1306,1328,1377,1408,1452,1480,1497,1498,1739,1838,1846,2151,2299,2450,2608,2694,2712,2830,3233,3444,3994,4076,5020,5092,5653],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"This movie was terrible. The first half hour is much like a... well, apologies for the lack of articulation, but it was simply a bad version of A Clockwork Orange. The first scene is almost photocopied from one of the first in Clockwork! Supposedly it was a tribute, as per the appearance of the Clockwork poster on the protagonist's wall, however \"ripoff\" is the more appropriate word. The movie felt as though it was torn right from the Kubrick classic, only filmed through a new director's eyes. A blind director. Unfortunately when it stops its massacre of Kubrick's work, the film gets even worse. As another commentator said, the deepness of this film is just shoved down your throat. Arrogant, self absorbed and ultimately meaningless drivel.<br /><br />Perhaps the protagonists ramblings would touch a nerve if there was any actual character development in this movie. I felt absolutely nothing for this guy. And I'm an alcoholic, so I figure that if anyone might be able to feel anything for him, it would be me. Awful character development, dialogue and plot.<br /><br />The worst part about this movie is the title. For a film called \"16 Years of Alcohol\", the alcoholism is hardly a factor in the flick. See first paragraph - it was such a butchering of A Clockwork Orange I can't get over it. A more suited title would have been \"16 Years of Violence,\" or, even better, \"A Clockwork Banana\".<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor and avoid this movie.

{"value":"Having not read the novel, I can't tell how faithful this film is. The story is typical mystery material: killer targets newlyweds; woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease. Yes, it sounds like a soap opera and that's exactly how it plays. The first 2/3 are dull, save for the murders and the last 1/3 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed toward its twisty conclusion.<br /><br />Acting is strictly sub par, though it's hard to blame the actors alone: the screenplay is atrocious. During the last 1/3 you stop noticing because the film actually becomes interesting, but that's only the last 1/3. Director Russell Mulcahy is very much in his element, but there's only so much he can do with a TV budget and the network censors on his back. He's pretty much limited to quick cutting and distorted lenses, though he managed to squeeze in a couple \"under the floor\" shots during the murders in the club restroom. Unfortunately, as this is made for TV, the cool compositional details he uses so well with a wider image are nowhere to be found. Note to producers: give this man a reasonable budget and an anamorphic lens when you hire him.<br /><br />Summing it up: this film is bad by cinema standards and mediocre by TV standards(watch CSI, instead). If you're in the mood for a film like this, I've some excellent suggestions: pick up a copy of Dario Argento's \"Deep Red\"(my highest recommendation; superb film), \"Opera\", or even \"Tenebre\". They're stronger in every category.","finished_norm":["have","not","read","the","novel","i","ca","not","tell","how","faith","thi","film","be","the","stori","be","typic","mysteri","materi","killer","target","newlyw","woman","investig","fall","in","love","with","her","partner","and","be","diagnos","with","a","fatal","diseas","ye","it","sound","like","a","soap","opu","and","that","exactli","how","it","plai","the","be","dull","save","for","the","murder","and","the","last","make","a","partial","comeback","a","it","pick","up","spe","toward","it","twisti","conclusionbr","br","act","be","strictli","sub","par","though","it","hard","to","blame","the","actor","alon","the","screenplai","be","atroci","dure","the","last","you","stop","notic","becaus","the","film","actual","becom","interest","but","that","onli","the","last","director","russel","mulcahi","be","veri","much","in","hi","elem","but","there","onli","so","much","he","can","do","with","a","tv","budget","and","the","network","censor","on","hi","back","he","pretti","much","limit","to","quick","cut","and","distort","lens","though","he","manag","to","squeez","in","a","coupl","under","the","floor","shot","dure","the","murder","in","the","club","restroom","unfortun","a","thi","be","make","for","tv","the","cool","composit","detail","he","us","so","good","with","a","wide","imag","be","nowher","to","be","find","note","to","produc","give","thi","man","a","reason","budget","and","a","anamorph","len","when","you","hire","himbr","br","sum","it","up","thi","film","be","bad","by","cinema","standard","and","mediocr","by","tv","standardswatch","csi","instead","if","you","re","in","the","mood","for","a","film","like","thi","i","have","some","excel","suggest","pick","up","a","copi","of","dario","argento","deep","redmi","high","recommend","superb","film","opu","or","even","tenebr","thei","re","strong","in","everi","categori"],"filtered":["read","novel","ca","tell","faith","thi","film","stori","typic","mysteri","materi","killer","target","newlyw","woman","investig","fall","love","partner","diagnos","fatal","diseas","ye","sound","like","soap","opu","exactli","plai","dull","save","murder","last","make","partial","comeback","pick","spe","toward","twisti","conclusionbr","br","act","strictli","sub","par","though","hard","blame","actor","alon","screenplai","atroci","dure","last","stop","notic","becaus","film","actual","becom","interest","onli","last","director","russel","mulcahi","veri","much","hi","elem","onli","much","tv","budget","network","censor","hi","back","pretti","much","limit","quick","cut","distort","lens","though","manag","squeez","coupl","floor","shot","dure","murder","club","restroom","unfortun","thi","make","tv","cool","composit","detail","us","good","wide","imag","nowher","find","note","produc","give","thi","man","reason","budget","anamorph","len","hire","himbr","br","sum","thi","film","bad","cinema","standard","mediocr","tv","standardswatch","csi","instead","re","mood","film","like","thi","excel","suggest","pick","copi","dario","argento","deep","redmi","high","recommend","superb","film","opu","even","tenebr","thei","re","strong","everi","categori"],"filtered2":["read","novel","ca","tell","faith","stori","typic","mysteri","materi","killer","target","newlyw","woman","investig","fall","love","partner","diagnos","fatal","diseas","ye","sound","like","soap","opu","exactli","plai","dull","save","murder","last","make","partial","comeback","pick","spe","toward","twisti","conclusionbr","act","strictli","sub","par","though","hard","blame","actor","alon","screenplai","atroci","dure","last","stop","notic","becaus","actual","becom","interest","onli","last","director","russel","mulcahi","veri","elem","onli","tv","budget","network","censor","back","pretti","limit","quick","cut","distort","lens","though","manag","squeez","coupl","floor","shot","dure","murder","club","restroom","unfortun","make","tv","cool","composit","detail","us","good","wide","imag","nowher","find","note","produc","give","man","reason","budget","anamorph","len","hire","himbr","sum","bad","cinema","standard","mediocr","tv","standardswatch","csi","instead","re","mood","like","excel","suggest","pick","copi","dario","argento","deep","redmi","high","recommend","superb","opu","even","tenebr","re","strong","everi","categori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,9,11,15,17,21,22,30,38,40,41,45,52,54,56,58,60,63,68,70,78,81,85,86,90,95,115,144,145,152,170,171,172,178,189,209,211,227,239,252,253,256,261,273,298,303,315,345,367,403,409,441,446,457,462,474,479,481,537,560,563,580,613,616,631,646,688,703,740,741,747,787,799,834,898,1014,1027,1035,1072,1113,1129,1148,1173,1200,1219,1237,1271,1343,1433,1473,1513,1582,1792,1909,1966,2027,2139,2180,2335,2607,2924,3417,3454,3995,4712,5142,5569,6057,6693,7304,8050],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,

{"value":"It really boggles my mind when someone comes across a movie like this and claims it to be one of the worst slasher films out there. This is by far not one of the worst out there, still not a good movie, but not the worst nonetheless. Go see something like Death Nurse or Blood Lake and then come back to me and tell me if you think the Night Brings Charlie is the worst. The film has decent camera work and editing, which is way more than I can say for many more extremely obscure slasher films.<br /><br />The film doesn't deliver on the on-screen deaths, there's one death where you see his pruning saw rip into a neck, but all other deaths are hardly interesting. But the lack of on-screen graphic violence doesn't mean this isn't a slasher film, just a bad one.<br /><br />The film was obviously intended not to be taken too seriously. The film came in at the end of the second slasher cycle, so it certainly was a reflection on traditional slasher elements, done in a tongue in cheek way. For example, after a kill, Charlie goes to the town's 'welcome' sign and marks the population down one less. This is something that can only get a laugh.<br /><br />If you're into slasher films, definitely give this film a watch. It is slightly different than your usual slasher film with possibility of two killers, but not by much. The comedy of the movie is pretty much telling the audience to relax and not take the movie so god darn serious. You may forget the movie, you may remember it. I'll remember it because I love the

{"value":"This (extremely)low-budget movie is compared to the great classic \"Silent Night Deadly Night\", since it is labeled as a Slasher Flick. First let me say that I think that even \"Silent Night Part 2\" is better than this (that one was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie). \"Christmas Evil\" tries to get psychological by introducing the main character as someone who goes insane,(a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is irritated by people who do not get the true meaning of Christmas and at work he can't stand how the fabricated toys are made with such lack of quality and love. Dressed up as Santa he finally goes on a killing spree. Also a strong word, since only 3 people are killed without the real need for special effects. No tension, no thrills, no gore, no cast. For one exception that is: Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing aside Tom Hanks as one of the guards in the classic \"The Green Mile\". He still must be kicking himself these days for ever accepting the role. He truly is the only one who really can act, his supporting role is better than the main lead. (who also isn't that bad, but if you're overshadowed by a little supporting character, you're not great either.). And what about that strange ending ?

{"value":"Every so often a movie comes along that knocks me down a notch and reminds me that my taste in films I seek out to watch isn't always impeccable. I normally would stay away from stuff like this, but I was duped by some glowing reviews and the Rohmer pedigree.<br /><br />There's an initial and intriguing novelty to the production where Rohmer essentially superimposes the actors onto painted (digital) back-drops of revolution era France. This quickly wanes and becomes about as interesting as watching the paint dry on a paint by numbers scene. What we're left with is a boring and stuffy film about aristocrats in 18th century France. None of the characters are appealing or sympathetic. The pace is so languid, the dialogue so arduous, and suspense is clearly a foreign concept to Rohmer, that I ended up not caring whose head rolled, who was harboring who, or what the devil the revolution was supposed to be about. The movie would've greatly benefited from some semblance of emotional build-up and a music score (there's some fine classical music used at the very end). Despite being so \"talky\", the film plays much like a silent film, and the worst kind of film at that, a dull and uninteresting film about infinitely interesting subjects. Only the most astute French historians will find anything to take from this film, as it dose seem to paint well known events from a new angle (the Lady is English and a royalist). Otherwise, avoid this yawner at all costs unless you are suffering from insomnia (I dozed off twice).","finished_norm":["everi","so","often","a","movi","come","along","that","knock","me","down","a","notch","and","remind","me","that","my","tast","in","film","i","seek","out","to","watch","be","not","alwai","impecc","i","normal","would","stai","awai","from","stuff","like","thi","but","i","be","dupe","by","some","glow","review","and","the","rohmer","pedigreebr","br","there","a","initi","and","intrigu","novelti","to","the","product","where","rohmer","essenti","superimpos","the","actor","onto","paint","digit","backdrop","of","revolut","era","franc","thi","quickli","wane","and","becom","about","a","interest","a","watch","the","paint","spindri","on","a","paint","by","number","scene","what","we","re","leav","with","be","a","bore","and","stuffi","film","about","aristocrat","in","th","centuri","franc","none","of","the","charact","be","appeal","or","sympathet","the","pace","be","so","languid","the","dialogu","so","arduou","and","suspens","be","clearli","a","foreign","concept","to","rohmer","that","i","end","up","not","care","whose","head","roll","who","be","harbor","who","or","what","the","devil","the","revolut","be","suppos","to","be","about","the","movi","would","have","greatli","benefit","from","some","semblanc","of","emot","buildup","and","a","music","score","there","some","fine","classic","music","us","at","the","veri","end","despit","be","so","talki","the","film","plai","much","like","a","silent","film","and","the","wrong","kind","of","film","at","that","a","dull","and","uninterest","film","about","infinit","interest","subject","onli","the","much","astut","french","historian","will","find","anyth","to","take","from","thi","film","a","it","dose","seem","to","paint","good","know","event","from","a","new","angl","the","ladi","be","english","and","a","royalist","otherwis","avoid","thi","yawner","at","all","cost","unless","you","be","suffer","from","insomnia","i","doze","off","twice"],"filtered":["everi","often","movi","come","along","knock","notch","remind","tast","film","seek","watch","alwai","impecc","normal","stai","awai","stuff","like","thi","dupe","glow","review","rohmer","pedigreebr","br","initi","intrigu","novelti","product","rohmer","essenti","superimpos","actor","onto","paint","digit","backdrop","revolut","era","franc","thi","quickli","wane","becom","interest","watch","paint","spindri","paint","number","scene","re","leav","bore","stuffi","film","aristocrat","th","centuri","franc","none","charact","appeal","sympathet","pace","languid","dialogu","arduou","suspens","clearli","foreign","concept","rohmer","end","care","whose","head","roll","harbor","devil","revolut","suppos","movi","greatli","benefit","semblanc","emot","buildup","music","score","fine","classic","music","us","veri","end","despit","talki","film","plai","much","like","silent","film","wrong","kind","film","dull","uninterest","film","infinit","interest","subject","onli","much","astut","french","historian","find","anyth","take","thi","film","dose","seem","paint","good","know","event","new","angl","ladi","english","royalist","otherwis","avoid","thi","yawner","cost","unless","suffer","insomnia","doze","twice"],"filtered2":["everi","often","come","along","knock","notch","remind","tast","seek","watch","alwai","impecc","normal","stai","awai","stuff","like","dupe","glow","review","rohmer","pedigreebr","initi","intrigu","novelti","product","rohmer","essenti","superimpos","actor","onto","paint","digit","backdrop","revolut","era","franc","quickli","wane","becom","interest","watch","paint","spindri","paint","number","scene","re","leav","bore","stuffi","aristocrat","th","centuri","franc","none","charact","appeal","sympathet","pace","languid","dialogu","arduou","suspens","clearli","foreign","concept","rohmer","end","care","whose","head","roll","harbor","devil","revolut","suppos","greatli","benefit","semblanc","emot","buildup","music","score","fine","classic","music","us","veri","end","despit","talki","plai","like","silent","wrong","kind","dull","uninterest","infinit","interest","subject","onli","astut","french","historian","find","anyth","take","dose","seem","paint","good","know","event","new","angl","ladi","english","royalist","otherwis","avoid","yawner","cost","unless","suffer","insomnia","doze","twice"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,10,11,15,19,24,25,26,31,34,35,38,40,41,56,60,68,74,85,87,104,108,115,118,122,149,155,176,190,197,205,208,248,324,332,335,361,365,367,370,391,400,460,464,470,472,494,506,518,529,546,550,588,598,627,633,644,689,700,726,771,795,837,853,868,872,899,1017,1163,1197,1204,1225,1226,1238,1248,1256,1293,1297,1383,1410,1411,1447,1770,2056,2279,2420,2452,2465,2566,3001,3008,3267,3671,3849,3907,4248,4427,4622,4672,4831,4836,5508,5663,6141,6238,6856,7852,8313],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1

{"value":"I love movies. I love independent efforts and major studio productions. I love films with stars and I love those featuring unknowns. I love dramas, comedies, action-adventures, science fiction, mysteries, westerns, any genre except horror. I love foreign films as well as those in English. I love good movies and I even love bad ones, because almost no film ever fails to entertain or amuse on some level. Except for \"Even Cowgirls Get the Blues.\"<br /><br />When I attended a late-night showing of \"Cowgirls,\" I joined an audience of around 10. Less than halfway into it, I alone remained. Soon not even I could tolerate the disturbing mess unfolding before my eyes, and I left as well. To this day \"Cowgirls\" remains the only movie I have ever walked out of.<br /><br />I don't quite know how to describe this incoherent, vacuous, trashy, meaningless film, or how to adequately convey its lack of redeeming value. Suffice to say that it ranks as one of the worst major films of all time, preposterous and inexcusable on every level. It tries to be clever, but its conception of feminism seems hopelessly anachronistic. It tries to be funny, but its humor is coarse and cringe-worthy. This is one of the few films which manages to profane its own ethos, by depicting protagonists in so off-putting a manner that you revolt against them and their values. If you want to watch a movie, watch \"Waterworld,\" \"Ishtar,\" anything but this. Except for the new \"Alexander.\" If you're choosing between that and this, read a book

{"value":"This was my first, and probably the last Angelopoulos movie. I was eager to get into it, as it featured Mastroianni, one of my favorite actors and was a film By Theo, of whom I've heard a lot. The opening was promising, a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the Albanian-Greek border. OK! but that was all. Nothing left. The movie had big holes and I don't know which to mention first. The main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman. during a long walk. It's like a 15 minutes monologue, killing the action and viewers patience, nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes, apart this old lady telling a story. All that is presumed to be shown through action, was simply told to the camera by the old lady. In a moment, the equippe of TV was heading to the bar. They turn the corner and immediately the winter begins! Probably, shot in different days, continuity leaked. A lot of problems with the story-telling, it went from absurd to irrational never sticking to a style, making the viewer asking questions that never got answers. Poor Mastroianni, given a role which lacked integrity or charm. On the other hand, as many Greeks or Albanians or Balcan people would agree with, the movies showed lot of historic, ethnic, or politically incorrectness, just for the sake of making a movie about \"humanity\" as a red in another review. A lot more to say, but no time to lose on a poor movie, which was not movie at all, but lunacies of a person impressed on film and paid with state money.","finished_norm":["thi","be","my","and","probabl","the","last","angelopoulo","movi","i","be","eager","to","get","into","it","a","it","featur","mastroianni","on","of","my","favorit","actor","and","be","a","film","by","theo","of","whom","i","have","hear","a","lot","the","open","be","promis","a","long","shoot","over","a","jeep","of","soldier","across","the","albaniangreek","border","okai","but","that","be","all","noth","leav","the","movi","have","big","hole","and","i","do","not","know","which","to","mention","the","main","plot","of","the","stori","be","reveal","to","the","journalist","by","the","old","woman","dure","a","long","walk","it","like","a","minut","monologu","kill","the","action","and","viewer","patienc","noth","happen","on","screen","for","or","even","minut","apart","thi","old","ladi","tell","a","stori","all","that","be","presum","to","be","show","through","action","be","simpli","tell","to","the","camera","by","the","old","ladi","in","a","moment","the","equipp","of","tv","be","head","to","the","bar","thei","turn","the","corner","and","immedi","the","winter","begin","probabl","shoot","in","differ","dai","continu","leak","a","lot","of","problem","with","the","storytel","it","go","from","absurd","to","irrat","never","stick","to","a","styl","make","the","viewer","ask","question","that","never","get","answer","poor","mastroianni","give","a","role","which","lack","integr","or","charm","on","the","other","hand","a","mani","greek","or","albanian","or","balcan","peopl","would","agre","with","the","movi","show","lot","of","histor","ethnic","or","polit","incorrect","just","for","the","sake","of","make","a","movi","about","human","a","a","red","in","anoth","review","a","lot","much","to","sai","but","no","time","to","lose","on","a","poor","movi","which","be","not","movi","at","all","but","lunaci","of","a","person","impress","on","film","and","pai","with","state","monei"],"filtered":["thi","probabl","last","angelopoulo","movi","eager","get","featur","mastroianni","favorit","actor","film","theo","hear","lot","open","promis","long","shoot","jeep","soldier","across","albaniangreek","border","okai","noth","leav","movi","big","hole","know","mention","main","plot","stori","reveal","journalist","old","woman","dure","long","walk","like","minut","monologu","kill","action","viewer","patienc","noth","happen","screen","even","minut","apart","thi","old","ladi","tell","stori","presum","show","action","simpli","tell","camera","old","ladi","moment","equipp","tv","head","bar","thei","turn","corner","immedi","winter","begin","probabl","shoot","differ","dai","continu","leak","lot","problem","storytel","go","absurd","irrat","never","stick","styl","make","viewer","ask","question","never","get","answer","poor","mastroianni","give","role","lack","integr","charm","hand","mani","greek","albanian","balcan","peopl","agre","movi","show","lot","histor","ethnic","polit","incorrect","sake","make","movi","human","red","anoth","review","lot","much","sai","time","lose","poor","movi","movi","lunaci","person","impress","film","pai","state","monei"],"filtered2":["probabl","last","angelopoulo","eager","get","featur","mastroianni","favorit","actor","theo","hear","lot","open","promis","long","shoot","jeep","soldier","across","albaniangreek","border","okai","noth","leav","big","hole","know","mention","main","plot","stori","reveal","journalist","old","woman","dure","long","walk","like","minut","monologu","kill","action","viewer","patienc","noth","happen","screen","even","minut","apart","old","ladi","tell","stori","presum","show","action","simpli","tell","camera","old","ladi","moment","equipp","tv","head","bar","turn","corner","immedi","winter","begin","probabl","shoot","differ","dai","continu","leak","lot","problem","storytel","go","absurd","irrat","never","stick","styl","make","viewer","ask","question","never","get","answer","poor","mastroianni","give","role","lack","integr","charm","hand","mani","greek","albanian","balcan","peopl","agre","show","lot","histor","ethnic","polit","incorrect","sake","make","human","red","anoth","review","lot","time","lose","poor","lunaci","person","impress","pai","state","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,6,8,17,23,26,28,30,32,41,42,49,50,59,67,70,72,73,74,76,82,90,94,96,99,117,126,128,129,132,144,146,147,148,153,167,172,176,179,183,188,191,192,201,204,208,216,221,231,235,239,242,279,285,292,294,305,306,322,378,380,416,418,433,472,498,503,572,575,622,657,683,779,797,800,810,822,833,928,953,987,1070,1270,1607,2028,2188,2222,2836,2921,3382,3404,3427,3572,3670,3691,3959,4390,5826,6178,6671],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"Sadly, it's true. \"Legiunea sträinä\" exposes with absolute clarity the parameters of Daneliuc's irreversible failure.<br /><br />As it was already said, the author lost the faculty to coalesce his content factors and artistic intentions in a coherent form. Maniacally concerned with the mechanic trick of picking at random news subjects and join them together without any legitimacy, he only gathers a disordered pile of events, unable to follow the least story-line. The script's level is similar to a \"Cântarea României\" amateur play about the glorious feats of socialist realism - only, turned upside down: while the communist line dictated a narrow concern only with positivism and sugary festivism, now Daneliuc is as perniciously obsessed only with negativism and disgusting scatology. The ideas content is zero, and the \"message\", infantile and didactic, at a kindergarten level.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he also forgot the most elementary professional tenets. He isn't able anymore to organize a dramatic situation, to order it in a correct movie scene, to frame it right and to edit it following the simplest rules of cinematographic grammar. His level of story-telling in film-images is similar to phrasing something like: \"Holy sheet man it ain't nuthin right 'ere, and all da people is asses!\" What a huge distance from the impressive artist of 1976-1984, who had created unique works as \"Cursa\", \"Proba de microfon\", \"Vânätoarea de vulpi\" - and even \"Croaziera\" and \"Glissando\"...

{"value":"The wife of a stage producer in London hopes to fix up the American song-and-dance man starring in her husband's latest show with an acquaintance, an American girl who makes her living modeling fashions in society circles. Unfortunately, the couple has already met on their own, with the girl thinking the guy is actually the show producer married to her friend (the fact he's not wearing a wedding ring should have discouraged any misunderstandings!). Wafty Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical is eventually dragged back down to the earth by Dwight Taylor and Allan Scott's idiotic script, which is full of juvenile behavior. Astaire and Rogers don't just 'meet cute'--they meet ridiculously (he's tap-dancing like a madman in the hotel suite above hers and she complains). Audiences of 1935 probably didn't care how these two were going to get together--as long as they did so, and happily. Seen today, the central characters appear to have no motivation to end up in each other's arms: he plies her with flowers (after telling his friend he wants to remain \"fancy free\" in the love department) and she gives him the brush-off. Nothing that a little dancing couldn't cure! This glamorous twosome are as deliberately unreal as are the London and Venice settings, but we watch simply because the leads are Fred and Ginger. It's a fantasy for have-nots...ones who don't mind the dumbed-down plot. The musical moments do break up the monotony of the contrived scenario, yet fail to transcend the surrounding silliness. ** from

{"value":"This film is based on the novel by John Fante. Could someone please tell me why? I see absolutely no reason why this fine book should be adapted in this way. If you want to make a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek, then how could you possibly make a connection to Ask The Dust (the novel)? -And if you wanted to make this story into a film, then why would you want to make it into a romantic melodramatic Hollywood production with Colin Farell and Selma Hayek? I don't get it.<br /><br />The adaptation of the story is poorly made, and if you have read the book and liked it, I'm almost sure you won't like what Towne did with it. <br /><br />In the beginning of the film you'll maybe find the casting odd, the acting bad and the cinematography just a bit overdone. But you hope for the best. I really hoped a lot during this film. I actually wanted it to be good. But it only gets worse, and it is as simple as that: Whether you read Fantes novel or not, this is not a good film. Just another romantic melodramatic Hollywood production combined with bad acting, lack of structure and - of course - plenty of shots of Colin Farells naked butt.<br /><br />I could complain a lot more about this film, but why waste my time. I've seen it. Alright. I had to see it, because I like the book so much and was curious. And I'm very disappointed.<br /><br />1/10 is for Colin's sweet little mustache in the end of the film.

{"value":"After watching Revolt Of The Zombies starring future Academy Award winner Dean Jagger I was left with one burning question. How was a society that created these ultimate warrior fighting machines ever defeated in the first place? <br /><br />That's the question you'll be pondering if you take time to watch Revolt Of The Zombies. Towards the end of World War I, the French discover a cult from occupied Cambodia where these undead creatures who cannot be stopped with bullets form a brigade of monks who go over the top and dislodge the Hun.<br /><br />This scares the living fecal matter out of everyone concerned so an international expedition is formed to find out destroy the secret of these zombies so no nation can get their hands on it and rule the world.<br /><br />But we've got some dissent in those ranks. First is Snidely Whiplash villain Roy D'Arcy who murders the Buddhist monk who has the secret and second is Dean Jagger. Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac as we all know and he's determined to woo Dorothy Stone away from rival Robert Noland.<br /><br />I think you've got some idea how this comes out, especially since a race of zombies didn't conquer the world for one country. Dean Jagger as he got the Oscar for Twelve O'Clock High must have shuddered every time he thought about this film and the awful dialog he tried to give a spark of sincerity to.<br /><br />Moral of the

{"value":"When many people say it's the \"worst movie I've ever seen\", they tend to say that about virtually any movie they didn't like. However, of the nearly 700 movies I can remember ever seeing this one is one of two that I walked away from feeling personally insulted and angry. This is my first movie review, by the way, and I registered with IMDb just to rave at this movie's badness. I went to see it when it was in the theaters (myself and my two buddies were 3 of 5 people there), and after 15 years I can't remember very many specifics, but my attitude upon leaving the theater is still crystal clear.<br /><br />---Spoiler alert---<br /><br />Oh my, where to begin. Fat loser left at altar, goes on ski weekend, meets blonde bombshell who takes an interest in him, takes him home to meet the family, they're all cannibals and he's the main course, pathetic attempt at a dramatic escape, kicks all their butts and runs off with the brother's girlfriend, they live happily ever after. Puke. Firstly, the gags are so bad that it took me a while to understand that they were trying to be FUNNY, and that this was a COMEDY. The special effects, what few there are, look like they were done 15 years earlier. The big dramatic ending was so hokey and poorly acted that it was nearly unbearable to watch (he knocks out the entire cannibal family with rakes laying in the lawn, that stand up Tom and Jerry style when they step on them). I'm sure that there's much, much more, but I have no intention on seeing it again for a refresher.","finished_norm":["when","mani","peopl","sai","it","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","thei","tend","to","sai","that","about","virtual","ani","movi","thei","do","not","like","howev","of","the","nearli","movi","i","can","rememb","ever","see","thi","on","be","on","of","two","that","i","walk","awai","from","feel","person","insult","and","angri","thi","be","my","movi","review","by","the","wai","and","i","regist","with","imdb","just","to","rave","at","thi","movi","bad","i","go","to","see","it","when","it","be","in","the","theater","myself","and","my","two","buddi","be","of","peopl","there","and","after","year","i","ca","not","rememb","veri","mani","specif","but","my","attitud","upon","leav","the","theater","be","still","crystal","clearbr","br","spoiler","alertbr","br","oh","my","where","to","begin","fat","loser","leav","at","altar","go","on","ski","weekend","meet","blond","bombshel","who","take","a","interest","in","him","take","him","home","to","meet","the","famili","thei","re","all","cannib","and","he","the","main","cours","pathet","attempt","at","a","dramat","escap","kick","all","their","butt","and","run","off","with","the","brother","girlfriend","thei","live","happili","ever","after","puke","firstli","the","gag","be","so","bad","that","it","take","me","a","while","to","understand","that","thei","be","try","to","be","funni","and","that","thi","be","a","comedi","the","special","effect","what","few","there","be","look","like","thei","be","do","year","earli","the","big","dramat","end","be","so","hokei","and","poorli","act","that","it","be","nearli","unbear","to","watch","he","knock","out","the","entir","cannib","famili","with","rake","lai","in","the","lawn","that","stand","up","tom","and","jerri","styl","when","thei","step","on","them","i","be","sure","that","there","much","much","much","but","i","have","no","intent","on","see","it","again","for","a","refresh"],"filtered":["mani","peopl","sai","wrong","movi","ever","see","thei","tend","sai","virtual","ani","movi","thei","like","howev","nearli","movi","rememb","ever","see","thi","two","walk","awai","feel","person","insult","angri","thi","movi","review","wai","regist","imdb","rave","thi","movi","bad","go","see","theater","two","buddi","peopl","year","ca","rememb","veri","mani","specif","attitud","upon","leav","theater","still","crystal","clearbr","br","spoiler","alertbr","br","oh","begin","fat","loser","leav","altar","go","ski","weekend","meet","blond","bombshel","take","interest","take","home","meet","famili","thei","re","cannib","main","cours","pathet","attempt","dramat","escap","kick","butt","run","brother","girlfriend","thei","live","happili","ever","puke","firstli","gag","bad","take","understand","thei","try","funni","thi","comedi","special","effect","look","like","thei","year","earli","big","dramat","end","hokei","poorli","act","nearli","unbear","watch","knock","entir","cannib","famili","rake","lai","lawn","stand","tom","jerri","styl","thei","step","sure","much","much","much","intent","see","refresh"],"filtered2":["mani","peopl","wrong","ever","see","tend","virtual","ani","like","howev","nearli","rememb","ever","see","two","walk","awai","feel","person","insult","angri","review","wai","regist","imdb","rave","bad","go","see","theater","two","buddi","peopl","year","ca","rememb","veri","mani","specif","attitud","upon","leav","theater","still","crystal","clearbr","spoiler","alertbr","oh","begin","fat","loser","leav","altar","go","ski","weekend","meet","blond","bombshel","take","interest","take","home","meet","famili","re","cannib","main","cours","pathet","attempt","dramat","escap","kick","butt","run","brother","girlfriend","live","happili","ever","puke","firstli","gag","bad","take","understand","try","funni","comedi","special","effect","look","like","year","earli","big","dramat","end","hokei","poorli","act","nearli","unbear","watch","knock","entir","cannib","famili","rake","lai","lawn","stand","tom","jerri","styl","step","sure","intent","see","refresh"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,9,15,16,21,23,24,25,27,31,33,36,43,44,47,50,57,60,62,64,68,74,81,82,106,113,116,119,127,137,147,153,155,176,177,179,182,198,199,203,212,234,266,290,294,302,350,377,380,381,398,424,490,592,601,611,630,638,709,730,756,759,811,869,985,998,1060,1151,1161,1302,1316,1410,1432,1525,1565,1666,1706,1709,1740,1821,1962,2153,2434,2756,2956,3197,3290,3786,4504,4632,6365,6668,7877],"values":[2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,9,15,16,21,23,24,25,27,31,33,36,43,44,47,50,57,60,62,64,68,74,81,82,106,113,116,119,127,137,147,153,155,176,177,179,182,198,199,203,2

{"value":"Full House is one of the worst TV series ever! Why?Because all the characters are so irritating that it's impossible to bear.The best character is Joey an even he is pretty irritating occasionally.An that girl DJ,who wrote her character?I want to kill my self every time she speaks.Not to mention when Danny start's with his philosophy.<br /><br />Example: DJ won around ten thousand dollars or more in the casino.However,she's not eighteen so she shouldn't gamble according to law.However the casino was ready to pay her the money but then Danny,her father cought's her and don't let's her raise that money because she is not eighteen.Oh come on,give me a break,will ya?Since i've seen that stupid and childish scene i instantly turned off the television.Some of the thing's they say in this series not even a child would bought.Who in the world could think that Full House is entertaining and funny?Every single word they say in this series seem's like Shakespeare wrote it.Except that Shakespere knew how to write and except that he wouldn't be that childish and stupid to write something as stupid as they wrote in the script for the Full House! <br /><br />For everyone who has a bad heart or any kind of bad medical condition or

{"value":"I can see little girls enjoying this show, but calling this a family show is ridiculous. I'm amazed how well remembered it is after all these years. It's an extremely unfunny and stupid show about widowed father of three living with his dead wife's brother and his stupid friend from school, and others as the seasons go on. All of the plot lines generally have a really dumb lesson. In the middle of each episode somebody is mad at somebody else and each episode they make up and it ends on a light unfunny joke. As for the actors, I didn't like them either. Bob Saget was painfully unfunny as the dad with the mom responsibilities. Dave Coulier is a one note joke 30 something year old that does cartoon voices and acts like a kid, and he's horrid. John Stamos was the most tolerable character but he was so clichéd it was hard to watch him. The oldest girl, DJ, on the show was a genuinely bad actress and showed no emotion ever. The middle girl Stephanie was too clichéd as the annoying little sister. The youngest girl Michelle showed what bad actresses the Olsen twins were. You can always tell when they are switching them off. The plot lines to too many story lines were so unrealistically stupid it's cringe worthy. This is a \"family\" show that tried to replace any good substance with cuteness and love, and though those are needed for a show about a family they overdid it way too much. This will be remembered as my least favorite sit-com from the 80's and 90's.<br /><br />My rating: Terrible show.
