{"value":"Ummm, please forgive me, but weren't more than half the characters missing? In the original novel, Valjean is a man imprisoned for 19 years for stealing a loaf of bread and then attempting several times to escape. He breaks parole and is pursued relentlessly by the police inspector Javert. Along the way there are MANY characters that weren't in this version. Some worth mentioning would be Fantine, Cosette, M & Mme. Thenardier, Eponine, Marius, Gavroche, and Enjolras. The only character with the same name is Javert. I was confused and frustrated throughout the whole movie, trying to see how it was in any way connected to Victor Hugo's epic novel.","finished_norm":["ummm","pleas","forgiv","me","but","be","not","much","than","half","the","charact","miss","in","the","origin","novel","valjean","be","a","man","imprison","for","year","for","steal","a","loaf","of","bread","and","then","attempt","sever","time","to","escap","he","break","parol","and","be","pursu","relentlessli","by","the","polic","inspector","javert","along","the","wai","there","be","mani","charact","that","be","not","in","thi","version","some","worth","mention","would","be","fantin","cosett","be","mme","thenardi","eponin","mariu","gavroch","and","enjolra","the","onli","charact","with","the","same","name","be","javert","i","be","confus","and","frustrat","throughout","the","whole","movi","try","to","see","how","it","be","in","ani","wai","connect","to","victor","hugo","epic","novel"],"filtered":["ummm","pleas","forgiv","much","half","charact","miss","origin","novel","valjean","man","imprison","year","steal","loaf","bread","attempt","sever","time","escap","break","parol","pursu","relentlessli","polic","inspector","javert","along","wai","mani","charact","thi","version","worth","mention","fantin","cosett","mme","thenardi","eponin","mariu","gavroch","enjolra","onli","charact","name","javert","confus","frustrat","throughout","whole","movi","try","see","ani","wai","connect","victor","hugo","epic","novel"],"filtered2":["ummm","pleas","forgiv","half","charact","miss","origin","novel","valjean","man","imprison","year","steal","loaf","bread","attempt","sever","time","escap","break","parol","pursu","relentlessli","polic","inspector","javert","along","wai","mani","charact","version","worth","mention","fantin","cosett","mme","thenardi","eponin","mariu","gavroch","enjolra","onli","charact","name","javert","confus","frustrat","throughout","whole","try","see","ani","wai","connect","victor","hugo","epic","novel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,10,11,27,33,36,45,50,57,69,111,143,177,206,219,220,255,285,316,324,346,360,427,438,471,474,578,638,767,1311,1366,1567,2287,2324,2468,4833,5420,5472],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,10,11,27,33,36,45,50,57,69,111,143,177,206,219,220,255,285,316,324,346,360,427,438,471,474,578,638,767,1311,1366,1567,2287,2324,2468,4833,5420,5472],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9418936859054116,3.3716610723085094,0.9913098153388195,1.3002700588679295,2.803707089537043,1.4680183469605717,1.8162961064622165,1.717994385570355,1.834162586674748,2.127032521151058,2.1183455303375887,2.3409902041158843,2.458149992634611,2.597304642813496,2.5792094178355414,2.8336934208777267,2.6754694156628323,2.808171552082607,2.878207028279898,2.8753661172782943,3.023389038124396,3.028335462059722,3.233054746047873,3.1797351085150902,3.496027715008137,7.293333077447711,3.575630765607104,3.613480989738201,3.79165684915245,4.456830177669989,4.422928625994308,4.679973728984199,5.649374286172302,5.604922523601468,5.185068678041204,6.0662680901040895,6.255510089742618,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.7931824809238005E-4,2.790707300717223E-4,2.7913963479074766E-4,2.790835187952802E-4,2.7910993073992186E-4,2.7906919135990737E-4,2.7915598575282497E-4,2.7902767041581336E-4,2.7907078905046816E-4,2.7935917847073593E-4,2.8157581224153716E-4,2.7907125000324595E-4,2.7933554811249736E-4,2.793646500573054E-4,2.792377419911771E-4,2.790846180648676E-4,2.7918063396702023E-4,2.793120173225036E-4,2.7909902600037177E-4,2.790980055866415E-4,2.79349096669901E-4,2.791259683574244E-4,2.7912639079038766E-4,2.7930520214488735E-4,2.7909912667841824E-4,2.793679891544125E-4,2.7916897015427494E-4,2.790701046163102E-4,2.7919662307570274E-4,2.7928183790959483E-4,2.791273375154747E-4,2.7927683203901593E-4,2.7941394999145123E-4,2.796732894625995E-4,2.7916848774244604E-4,2.7908444879562255E-4,2.791850745004233E-4,2.7911279242761016E-4,2.790279682261291E-4,2.790989395679453E-4,2.793786444005776E-4,2.7922538762804893E-4,2.792774684627978E-4,2.790418554169622E-4,2.7909901053573525E-4,2.790843438492141E-4,2.791788113692405E-4,2.792272213240765E-4,2.791704420464734E-4,2.791261930381848E-4,2.790850340033514E-4,2.796568339153172E-4,2.7915525983715007E-4,2.790989465665964E-4,2.791537648573404E-4,2.790703901429645E-4,0.9779431299389859,2.791139297842152E-4,2.7908542580301865E-4,2.79070230842469E-4,2.7929349372151735E-4,2.7918137831187356E-4,2.7907011418378495E-4,2.7904174172900043E-4,2.7901368099952505E-4,2.792659535345738E-4,2.7908378562699956E-4,2.792106467356921E-4,2.792925879822156E-4,2.791658783699422E-4,2.7909931622390545E-4,2.790421075341294E-4,2.791134916608969E-4,2.7904195723859427E-4,2.7905660090923076E-4,2.7904211543171656E-4,2.792232527580511E-4,2.7914014698228814E-4,2.7907048667055555E-4,2.790975198789394E-4]}}

{"value":"The only reason I didn't score this a one is that Sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film. It is a technically adept film.<br /><br />That having been said, this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven. Most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program, rather than actual fact. And Sibrel's \"irrefutable proof\" that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics.<br /><br />I do not recommend watching this, but if you do, see it at google video for free.

{"value":"'Iedereen Beroemd' has everything we can expect from a straight to video-movie. It's the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star. The only thing he needs is to get her on stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters. A simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail. The problem with the movie is not the basic plot, but how it is made. Everything is supposed to be funny, but it isn't. It is trivial and clumsy, the characters are shallow, and the end-sequence is totally without climax or emotion. The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing, but only at how pathetic the whole set-up

I was hoping to see a lot of cool murders and hot chicks,instead the director depended on animal slaughter videos to shock you, the watcher. Disgusting. The murders are pretty lame, basically strangulation. One woman he stuffs worms in her mouth, one he puts raw hamburgers on her face and strangles her. BTK = BTK broiler, burger king's \"killer\" new sandwich....ha ha. I don't think this movie relied too much on actual facts. I mean, he real BTK killer didn't carry around a bunch of rodents, scorpions and worms..and oh yeah...a slaughtered cow head too.

{"value":"This is perhaps the creepiest display of Santa Claus ever committed to any medium, whether it be a book, a picture, or a movie. Santa looks like a perv looking down on the children and the twisted story of bringing Merlin in to help him defeat one of Satan's minions, Pitch, doesn't make things any better. It's laughable to say the least, with bad effects, even for 1959 standards. If a kid were to watch this movie, he'd have nightmares and never want Santa to visit. They'd be scarred for life.

{"value":"The plot, character development, and gags in this movie are all extremely weak. Quite a waste of time. The conclusion of Saving Grace is supposed to make one feel warm and fuzzy as though the characters have grown through their struggles. There was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible. The drug gags are cliched and much of the movie doesn't ring true to life. The plot builds what is supposed to be tension but the characters aren't developed enough to care. Then it rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding problems in about a minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling like they have just wasted their time.","finished_norm":["the","plot","charact","develop","and","gag","in","thi","movi","be","all","extrem","weak","quit","a","wast","of","time","the","conclus","of","save","grace","be","suppos","to","make","on","feel","warm","and","fuzzi","a","though","the","charact","have","grow","through","their","struggl","there","be","no","such","develop","to","make","such","warm","fuzzi","feel","possibl","the","drug","gag","be","clich","and","much","of","the","movi","doe","not","ring","true","to","life","the","plot","build","what","be","suppos","to","be","tension","but","the","charact","be","not","develop","enough","to","care","then","it","rush","through","a","resolut","of","all","the","outstand","problem","in","about","a","minut","of","screen","time","leav","the","viewer","feel","like","thei","have","just","wast","their","time"],"filtered":["plot","charact","develop","gag","thi","movi","extrem","weak","quit","wast","time","conclus","save","grace","suppos","make","feel","warm","fuzzi","though","charact","grow","struggl","develop","make","warm","fuzzi","feel","possibl","drug","gag","clich","much","movi","doe","ring","true","life","plot","build","suppos","tension","charact","develop","enough","care","rush","resolut","outstand","problem","minut","screen","time","leav","viewer","feel","like","thei","wast","time"],"filtered2":["plot","charact","develop","gag","extrem","weak","quit","wast","time","conclus","save","grace","suppos","make","feel","warm","fuzzi","though","charact","grow","struggl","develop","make","warm","fuzzi","feel","possibl","drug","gag","clich","doe","ring","true","life","plot","build","suppos","tension","charact","develop","enough","care","rush","resolut","outstand","problem","minut","screen","time","leav","viewer","feel","like","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,8,10,18,32,43,59,74,75,86,89,93,120,149,167,189,192,205,279,304,320,329,379,402,477,561,697,842,887,956,998,1084,1149,1364,1581,1922,2362,2422,4641],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,8,10,18,32,43,59,74,75,86,89,93,120,149,167,189,192,205,279,304,320,329,379,402,477,561,697,842,887,956,998,1084,1149,1364,1581,1922,2362,2422,4641],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,2.825681057716235,3.3716610723085094,1.2153159934048174,2.742262257014735,4.982433610865464,1.8693254449200722,1.9486336368009016,1.9742250248702675,2.031112399272319,3.9880092219144876,2.035389827120098,2.2044500422972613,4.650639560718045,2.4609576687888097,2.498193474075453,2.5318267134339894,2.571852579609833,2.7910771187233068,2.871119826396843,8.814895092460665,2.951986790814132,3.1272886331425473,3.084424928710765,3.351345009714117,3.4725585804672896,3.7952092507568174,3.8883864756110005,3.944626193933877,3.969732115064953,8.270493107085054,4.224077767249142,4.297765483040301,4.436351646326448,4.671389985292807,10.128232135247083,5.143104478942172,5.116075806554253,12.275454108172468]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805355E-4,2.1925531043720598E-4,2.1930944626706033E-4,2.1926535805328188E-4,2.19286108918556E-4,2.1925410152956966E-4,2.193222925991185E-4,2.192214800952665E-4,2.1925535677457442E-4,2.1948193342720784E-4,2.2122345868647709E-4,2.1925571892772593E-4,2.1946336794909405E-4,2.1948623224568857E-4,2.1938652538130765E-4,2.192662217077919E-4,2.1934165776813395E-4,2.194448806979818E-4,2.192775414774106E-4,2.1927673977696296E-4,2.1947401253786462E-4,2.1929870906764107E-4,2.192990409572322E-4,2.194395262708674E-4,2.1927762057634125E-4,2.194888556479086E-4,2.1933249395190825E-4,2.1925481904056077E-4,2.193542198056751E-4,2.194211698754802E-4,2.1929978476330176E-4,2.1941723695242696E-4,2.1952496533805875E-4,2.197287185451422E-4,2.1933211493919242E-4,2.1926608871935255E-4,2.1934514652716485E-4,2.1928835723826443E-4,2.1922171407356012E-4,2.1927747357072436E-4,2.194972270715441E-4,2.1937681902578187E-4,2.1941773696650525E-4,2.192326247137997E-4,2.19277529327431E-4,2.192660062669314E-4,2.1934022582203953E-4,2.1937825969134961E-4,2.1933365036190086E-4,2.192988855908109E-4,2.1926654849491634E-4,2.1971579004444685E-4,2.1932172227464693E-4,2.1927747906929967E-4,2.1932054772559202E-4,2.1925504336804653E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.192892508163027E-4,2.1926685631708617E-4,2.1925491821167637E-4,2.1943032740576226E-4,2.1934224257171348E-4,2.1925482655736357E-4,2.1923253539347096E-4,2.1921048914035573E-4,2.1940869012321295E-4,2.1926556769286487E-4,2.193652376645657E-4,2.19429615800673E-4,2.193300648539749E-4,2.1927776949505674E-4,2.1923282279271596E-4,2.1928890659939345E-4,2.1923270471120235E-4,2.1924420968899244E-4,2.1923282899755127E-4,2.1937514173922445E-4,2.1930984867656844E-4,2.1925511920612147E-4,2.1927635817480437E-4]}}

this is THE WORST FILM IN THE WORLD!!! seriously doesn't it even give you a hit seeing as it cost my 99p from sainsburys and it was only made in 2005? hahaha this film is like a cheap college movie

{"value":"This must be one of the most overrated Spanish films in history. Its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correction make it really childish, with only good/bad characters. The world is just not like this, and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. However, what I HATE most about this film is Bola's friend's father. The director tries to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than the average looking dad (wow, this is like... philosophy, or something).

{"value":"I watched Free Money last night & it was the longest 90+ minutes of my life. With such an intriguing cast, I really thought that I was in for a treat - especially since I'm a Brando fan. WRONG! What a waste of talent. It's almost embarrassing to watch at times (like the cattle prod scene), & there were so many missed opportunities for humorous setups (why didn't they show Charlie Sheen's character going back to tow Brando's truck?) Ugh. It tries to be a slapstick comedy, but I just wasn't buying into it. Skip this one. Only for die-hard Brando fans.<br /><br />I'm giving it 2 out of 10 because I still think the worse movie ever made was Skidoo.","finished_norm":["i","watch","free","monei","last","night","it","be","the","long","+","minut","of","my","life","with","such","a","intrigu","cast","i","realli","think","that","i","be","in","for","a","treat","especi","sinc","i","be","a","brando","fan","wrong","what","a","wast","of","talent","it","almost","embarrass","to","watch","at","time","like","the","cattl","prod","scene","there","be","so","mani","miss","opportun","for","humor","setup","why","do","not","thei","show","charli","sheen","charact","go","back","to","tow","brando","truck","ugh","it","try","to","be","a","slapstick","comedi","but","i","just","be","not","bui","into","it","skip","thi","on","onli","for","diehard","brando","fansbr","br","i","be","give","it","out","of","becaus","i","still","think","the","wrong","movi","ever","make","be","skidoo"],"filtered":["watch","free","monei","last","night","long","+","minut","life","intrigu","cast","realli","think","treat","especi","sinc","brando","fan","wrong","wast","talent","almost","embarrass","watch","time","like","cattl","prod","scene","mani","miss","opportun","humor","setup","thei","show","charli","sheen","charact","go","back","tow","brando","truck","ugh","try","slapstick","comedi","bui","skip","thi","onli","diehard","brando","fansbr","br","give","becaus","still","think","wrong","movi","ever","make","skidoo"],"filtered2":["watch","free","monei","last","night","long","+","minut","life","intrigu","cast","realli","think","treat","especi","sinc","brando","fan","wrong","wast","talent","almost","embarrass","watch","time","like","cattl","prod","scene","mani","miss","opportun","humor","setup","show","charli","sheen","charact","go","back","tow","brando","truck","ugh","try","slapstick","comedi","bui","skip","onli","diehard","brando","fansbr","give","becaus","still","think","wrong","ever","make","skidoo"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,19,22,25,28,30,36,44,50,59,63,64,75,89,92,99,126,127,131,140,144,162,210,255,267,276,347,369,556,686,849,931,993,1017,1489,1622,1717,1985,2130,3187,3331,3534,4602,5254,7358,8349,8591],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,19,22,25,28,30,36,44,50,59,63,64,75,89,92,99,126,127,131,140,144,162,210,255,267,276,347,369,556,686,849,931,993,1017,1489,1622,1717,1985,2130,3187,3331,3534,4602,5254,7358,8349,8591],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,2.559277576165403,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,1.604729392502474,1.717994385570355,1.8693254449200722,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,1.9742250248702675,1.9940046109572438,2.0489535369135887,2.056430207256609,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.2512118082053005,2.317169775997098,2.2931108769894046,2.3586007221245198,2.687151791517189,2.6754694156628323,2.7085302779237206,2.7884729505849193,3.0151989841543516,3.121829110937649,3.43462735814388,3.6016814428070463,3.880604335168946,3.9241755834625858,4.026392148630444,4.0536665665501035,5.02684467282631,4.770124825978496,4.956227105612356,4.869215728622727,5.02684467282631,18.413181162258702,5.541743621979936,5.626901430320244,6.2980697041614135,6.489124940924123,6.725513718988353,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.014580719987593E-4,2.0127954981638413E-4,2.0132924729208173E-4,2.0128877367343214E-4,2.01307823268228E-4,2.0127844002166892E-4,2.0134104041092708E-4,2.0124849307261752E-4,2.0127959235475933E-4,2.0148759300272546E-4,2.0308633840816445E-4,2.0127992481659644E-4,2.0147054962498738E-4,2.0149153938033807E-4,2.014000070350727E-4,2.0128956652077813E-4,2.0135881791649252E-4,2.014535780607694E-4,2.0129995823319928E-4,2.0129922226057968E-4,2.0148032151161326E-4,2.013193903875393E-4,2.0131969506698976E-4,2.0144866261914582E-4,2.0130003084716297E-4,2.014939477015631E-4,2.013504054005045E-4,2.0127909870714837E-4,2.0137035004885463E-4,2.0143181118237826E-4,2.01320377891732E-4,2.0142820070206635E-4,2.0152709691999225E-4,2.0171414531445814E-4,2.0135005746134323E-4,2.012894444354651E-4,2.013620206478004E-4,2.0130988725827623E-4,2.0124870786807913E-4,2.0129989589387802E-4,2.015016327896794E-4,2.013910964601512E-4,2.0142865972223045E-4,2.0125872399380604E-4,2.0129994707934206E-4,2.0128936874294856E-4,2.0135750336924311E-4,2.0139241901200337E-4,2.0135146700162263E-4,2.0131955243836528E-4,2.0128986651609025E-4,2.0170227676361404E-4,2.0134051684480385E-4,2.0129990094164976E-4,2.0133943859176385E-4,2.0127930464302856E-4,0.9840914994019674,2.0131070757585442E-4,2.0129014910129944E-4,2.012791897476685E-4,2.0144021792777898E-4,2.0135935477464653E-4,2.0127910560

Unfortunately I would have to say that this was probably the worst movie I have seen this year. Don't get me wrong the cars were nice and the girls were OK but the way they put the movie together was just plain crappy to put it nicely. The story just never made you care about the cast and the movie seemed just pieced together. So overall this movie was not the worst thing ever by far but if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend I would pass on this one for now.","finished_norm":["okai","so","i","go","into","thi","movi","not","realli","expect","much","i","figur","a","action","flick","similar","to","the","fast","and","the","furiou","some","nice","car","some","nice","girl","somewhat","of","a","decent","plot","unfortun","i","would","have","to","sai","that","thi","be","probabl","the","wrong","movi","i","have","see","thi","year","do","not","get","me","wrong","the","car","be","nice","and","the","girl","be","okai","but","the","wai","thei","put","the","movi","togeth","be","just","plain","crappi","to","put","it","nice","the","stori","just","never","make","you","care","about","the","cast","and","the","movi","seem","just","piec","togeth","so","overal","thi","movi","be","not","the","wrong","thing","ever","by","far","but","if","your","look","for","a","movi","to","go","to","thi","weekend","i","would","pass","on","thi","on","for","now"],"filtered":["okai","go","thi","movi","realli","expect","much","figur","action","flick","similar","fast","furiou","nice","car","nice","girl","somewhat","decent","plot","unfortun","sai","thi","probabl","wrong","movi","see","thi","year","get","wrong","car","nice","girl","okai","wai","thei","put","movi","togeth","plain","crappi","put","nice","stori","never","make","care","cast","movi","seem","piec","togeth","overal","thi","movi","wrong","thing","ever","far","look","movi","go","thi","weekend","pass","thi"],"filtered2":["okai","go","realli","expect","figur","action","flick","similar","fast","furiou","nice","car","nice","girl","somewhat","decent","plot","unfortun","probabl","wrong","see","year","get","wrong","car","nice","girl","okai","wai","put","togeth","plain","crappi","put","nice","stori","never","make","care","cast","seem","piec","togeth","overal","wrong","thing","ever","far","look","go","weekend","pass"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,13,16,17,25,29,32,33,35,42,44,57,84,92,101,129,130,148,159,191,205,218,227,257,262,270,284,309,412,415,487,542,586,589,596,1077,1565,4363],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,13,16,17,25,29,32,33,35,42,44,57,84,92,101,129,130,148,159,191,205,218,227,257,262,270,284,309,412,415,487,542,586,589,596,1077,1565,4363],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,3.838916364248105,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.834162586674748,4.442538903180445,2.0489535369135887,2.098582041218749,2.4106958340079214,2.2642139034199635,2.3018654096236517,4.60053593038899,5.092022696851891,2.571852579609833,2.5940874818617203,2.6005321873043625,2.7602659523229094,10.906806333951264,5.463207108176046,6.221997360326558,2.848772527704847,3.107414446935464,3.1588018988486244,3.3220965805878846,3.4471119148061256,3.4572130107926293,3.530930586689197,3.485528930909917,4.235066888824737,4.671389985292807,6.032366538428407]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.318746545765169E-4,2.3166917872259954E-4,2.3172637963242844E-4,2.3167979521786155E-4,2.317017209623566E-4,2.3166790136863854E-4,2.31739953302282E-4,2.3163343296338668E-4,2.3166922768351215E-4,2.319086327265582E-4,2.3374876022784906E-4,2.3166961034116825E-4,2.3188901610218256E-4,2.3191317493693808E-4,2.3180782283696808E-4,2.3168070777104276E-4,2.3176041489471815E-4,2.3186948213389018E-4,2.3169266844704945E-4,2.3169182135566584E-4,2.3190026336973287E-4,2.3171503451076966E-4,2.317153851913933E-4,2.318638245480846E-4,2.3169275202442903E-4,2.3191594687179591E-4,2.3175073223857297E-4,2.3166865950389966E-4,2.317736881737755E-4,2.318444288443492E-4,2.317161711105162E-4,2.3184027324578283E-4,2.3195410103209578E-4,2.3216939040434859E-4,2.3175033176679223E-4,2.316805672530208E-4,2.317641011814395E-4,2.317040965781596E-4,2.3163368018913925E-4,2.3169259669560043E-4,2.3192479227141023E-4,2.317975669238567E-4,2.318408015698204E-4,2.3164520857154696E-4,2.3169265560915838E-4,2.3168048013228173E-4,2.3175890187423527E-4,2.317990891574949E-4,2.3175195412256162E-4,2.3171522102838558E-4,2.3168105306030658E-4,2.321557299136073E-4,2.317393506869945E-4,2.3169260250549586E-4,2.317381096369402E-4,2.3166889653243177E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908907E-4,2.3168137831085188E-4,2.3166876428991765E-4,2.3185410485865115E-4,2.3176103280889645E-4,2.3166866744629125E-4,2.3164511419405089E-4,2.316218197190257E-4,2.3183124250942007E-4,2.3168001672688643E-4,2.317853298453746E-4,2.3185335296367415E-4,2.3174816560918489E-4,2.3169290937467265E-4,2.3164541786535955E-4,2.3170467704319522E-4,2.316452930982685E-4,2.3165744946862293E-4,2.3164542442150225E-4,2.3179579467214493E-4,2.317268048256886E-4,2.3166897666433145E-4,2.3169141814783246E-4]}}
{"value":"This movie is god awful. Not one quality to this movie. You would think that the gore would be good but it sucks bad. The effects are worse and the acting if you can call it acting is the worst I've ever seen. This movie was obviously shot on a camcorder and runs on a budget around 500 dollars probably. If you want to watch a good Zombie movie than watch Dawn of the dead or Day of the dead. If you want to watch a good cheap shot on video Zombie movie like this but way better than watch Redneck Zombies. Please avoid this movie at all costs. It is unwatchable and pointless.

time.","finished_norm":["actual","the","movi","be","neither","horror","nor","scifi","with","a","veri","strong","christian","religi","theme","thi","movi","deliv","minim","content","and","no","suspens","secondti","actor","do","halfdec","job","of","read","their","bore","role","the","onli","good","perform","be","by","sydnei","penni","who","plai","a","role","of","a","mother","of","i","wo","not","spoil","the","movi","it","either","christ","or","antichrist","avoid","watch","thi","movi","unless","you","a","christian","religi","fanat","obsess","with","apocalypsebr","br","be","a","nonchristian","i","have","to","forc","myself","to","watch","thi","movi","just","becaus","i","want","to","write","thi","review","it","a","piti","that","scifi","channel","have","to","air","thi","movi","at","the","peak","even","time"],"filtered":["actual","movi","neither","horror","scifi","veri","strong","christian","religi","theme","thi","movi","deliv","minim","content","suspens","secondti","actor","halfdec","job","read","bore","role","onli","good","perform","sydnei","penni","plai","role","mother","wo","spoil","movi","either","christ","antichrist","avoid","watch","thi","movi","unless","christian","religi","fanat","obsess","apocalypsebr","br","nonchristian","forc","watch","thi","movi","becaus","want","write","thi","review","piti","scifi","channel","air","thi","movi","peak","even","time"],"filtered2":["actual","neither","horror","scifi","veri","strong","christian","religi","theme","deliv","minim","content","suspens","secondti","actor","halfdec","job","read","bore","role","onli","good","perform","sydnei","penni","plai","role","mother","wo","spoil","either","christ","antichrist","avoid","watch","unless","christian","religi","fanat","obsess","apocalypsebr","nonchristian","forc","watch","becaus","want","write","review","piti","scifi","channel","air","peak","even","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,11,15,22,37,40,41,52,65,83,105,108,128,145,176,207,289,335,338,397,406,460,517,529,534,631,679,684,718,728,781,1122,1142,1193,1266,1316,1931,2066,3152,3249,4214,4246,6197],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,11,15,22,37,40,41,52,65,83,105,108,128,145,176,207,289,335,338,397,406,460,517,529,534,631,679,684,718,728,781,1122,1142,1193,1266,1316,1931,2066,3152,3249,4214,4246,6197],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.2979240167361772,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.7122153074726136,1.9073850067444174,2.292318797740072,2.1765612129984904,2.138507503627933,4.681980408231769,2.34599021453259,2.5040471493269134,2.5531798379045583,2.8282659991423613,2.908534262247101,2.9720957437368454,3.3176717946075294,3.121829110937649,3.216957819005698,3.4198487640477615,3.4648563601051974,3.4933926673701317,3.607563812710113,3.6715125373103863,8.260518024062975,3.634471265630037,3.7740817043309423,7.872791389594723,4.263079925052412,4.263079925052412,4.240607069200353,4.327618446189983,9.19456402627817,5.143104478942172,4.933754249760298,5.521540914662417,5.541743621979936,6.032366538428407,6.214688095222362,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918352E-4,2.3612552253122064E-4,2.3618382374676034E-4,2.3613634324334566E-4,2.36158690747249E-4,2.361242206063243E-4,2.3619765851711915E-4,2.3608908917345183E-4,2.3612557243393595E-4,2.3636958262639038E-4,2.3824510646673104E-4,2.3612596245232122E-4,2.3634958866039743E-4,2.363742122098564E-4,2.362668335771339E-4,2.3613727335022451E-4,2.362185137048159E-4,2.3632967894044428E-4,2.3614946409949674E-4,2.3614860071362605E-4,2.3636105227822527E-4,2.361722603925212E-4,2.3617261781876998E-4,2.363239125264052E-4,2.3614954928455472E-4,2.3637703746512054E-4,2.3620864479495754E-4,2.3612499332492963E-4,2.3623204230611885E-4,2.3630414373063946E-4,2.3617341885568208E-4,2.3629990819577752E-4,2.3641592555151696E-4,2.3663535618876835E-4,2.3620823661977858E-4,2.3613713012922487E-4,2.3622227090024033E-4,2.3616111205994108E-4,2.3608934115479146E-4,2.3614939096785063E-4,2.363860530131423E-4,2.362563803832485E-4,2.3630044668255477E-4,2.361010912949481E-4,2.3614945101465846E-4,2.36137041332648E-4,2.3621697158016173E-4,2.3625793189828046E-4,2.362098901828718E-4,2.3617245049795414E-4,2.3613762528140628E-4,2.366214329274519E-4,2.3619704431003977E-4,2.361493968895041E-4,2.3619577938738506E-4,2.3612523491289706E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276115E-4,2.3613795678840857E-4,2.3612510012659135E-4,2.3631400587089337E-4,2.362191435050726E-4,2.3612500142009956E-4,2.3610099510202465E-4,2.360772525389537E-4,2.3629070374590528E-4,2.3613656901327556E-4,2.3624390791467597E-4,2.3631323951260906E-4,2.3620602879437968E-4,2.361497096615574E-4,2.3610130461469624E-4,2.361617036906906E-4,2.361011

{"value":"\"They Are Among Us\" is poor science fiction at best. Mediocre acting bogs down this film. The plot holes are numerous. Aliens that somehow came to earth on a meteor and have been hiding among us for over 100 years, but need a plastic surgeon to make them appear human. In their alien form they supposedly have exo-skeletons (which is why they need the plastic surgery) but when you see them they have teeth and fingernails. The heroine's father \"disappeared\" after Project Blue Book closed, but was supposedly an F-16 pilot. And on and on. If you want to see an alien invasion movie, pick \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", and see how it is done right.","finished_norm":["thei","be","among","u","be","poor","scienc","fiction","at","well","mediocr","act","bog","down","thi","film","the","plot","hole","be","numer","alien","that","somehow","come","to","earth","on","a","meteor","and","have","be","hide","among","u","for","over","year","but","ne","a","plastic","surgeon","to","make","them","appear","human","in","their","alien","form","thei","supposedli","have","exoskeleton","which","be","why","thei","ne","the","plastic","surgeri","but","when","you","see","them","thei","have","tooth","and","fingernail","the","heroin","father","disappear","after","project","blue","book","close","but","be","supposedli","a","f","pilot","and","on","and","on","if","you","want","to","see","a","alien","invas","movi","pick","invas","of","the","bodi","snatcher","and","see","how","it","be","do","right"],"filtered":["thei","among","u","poor","scienc","fiction","well","mediocr","act","bog","thi","film","plot","hole","numer","alien","somehow","come","earth","meteor","hide","among","u","year","ne","plastic","surgeon","make","appear","human","alien","form","thei","supposedli","exoskeleton","thei","ne","plastic","surgeri","see","thei","tooth","fingernail","heroin","father","disappear","project","blue","book","close","supposedli","f","pilot","want","see","alien","invas","movi","pick","invas","bodi","snatcher","see","right"],"filtered2":["among","u","poor","scienc","fiction","well","mediocr","act","bog","plot","hole","numer","alien","somehow","come","earth","meteor","hide","among","u","year","ne","plastic","surgeon","make","appear","human","alien","form","supposedli","exoskeleton","ne","plastic","surgeri","see","tooth","fingernail","heroin","father","disappear","project","blue","book","close","supposedli","f","pilot","want","see","alien","invas","pick","invas","bodi","snatcher","see","right"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,20,21,32,34,37,57,110,112,121,146,151,170,292,295,343,376,446,522,549,565,659,689,707,787,810,826,910,916,946,1040,1096,1203,1212,1308,1430,1593,1738,3200,3264,4251,4829,5714,7091],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,20,21,32,34,37,57,110,112,121,146,151,170,292,295,343,376,446,522,549,565,659,689,707,787,810,826,910,916,946,1040,1096,1203,1212,1308,1430,1593,1738,3200,3264,4251,4829,5714,7091],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.967100616408184,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.834162586674748,4.2580959472608155,4.493325799357863,2.2190595059394194,2.326138445979858,2.8002454868101863,2.4214486257841834,2.9752256367457734,2.7910771187233068,3.112795625839981,3.1569204307489187,3.233054746047873,3.604618302480356,3.4471119148061256,11.724332942876337,3.6405503117064195,3.607563812710113,3.6375061693251913,3.760240652919071,3.8425769395797067,7.6408716274049855,4.096025840389245,4.100845126825194,7.922586492838177,4.240607069200353,4.429617614145104,4.3521595551061,4.550761997504193,4.506310234933358,4.760735085628657,4.589376833631972,9.521470171257315,5.695894301807195,11.298748572344604,5.907203395474402,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805376E-4,2.192553104372062E-4,2.1930944626706055E-4,2.1926535805328213E-4,2.192861089185562E-4,2.1925410152956988E-4,2.1932229259911872E-4,2.192214800952667E-4,2.1925535677457463E-4,2.1948193342720805E-4,2.212234586864773E-4,2.1925571892772615E-4,2.1946336794909427E-4,2.1948623224568882E-4,2.193865253813079E-4,2.1926622170779215E-4,2.1934165776813416E-4,2.1944488069798203E-4,2.1927754147741082E-4,2.192767397769632E-4,2.1947401253786484E-4,2.1929870906764129E-4,2.1929904095723243E-4,2.194395262708676E-4,2.192776205763415E-4,2.194888556479088E-4,2.193324939519085E-4,2.1925481904056098E-4,2.1935421980567532E-4,2.194211698754804E-4,2.19299784763302E-4,2.1941723695242718E-4,2.19524965338059E-4,2.1972871854514242E-4,2.1933211493919264E-4,2.1926608871935277E-4,2.1934514652716507E-4,2.1928835723826465E-4,2.1922171407356034E-4,2.1927747357072458E-4,2.1949722707154432E-4,2.1937681902578209E-4,2.1941773696650547E-4,2.1923262471379993E-4,2.192775293274312E-4,2.1926600626693163E-4,2.1934022582203975E-4,2.1937825969134983E-4,2.1933365036190107E-4,2.1929888559081112E-4,2.1926654849491656E-4,2.1971579004444707E-4,2.1932172227464715E-4,2.192774790692999E-4,2.1932054772559224E-4,2.1925504336804674E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630293E-4,2.192668563170864E-4,2.1925491821167659E-4,2.1943032740576247E-4,2.1934224257171372E-4,2.1925482655736378E-4,2.192325353934712E-4,2.1921048914035594E-4,2.1940869012321317E-4,2.1926556769286508E-4,2.193652376645659E-4,2.1942961580067325E-4,2.193300648539751E-4,2.1927776949505696E-4,2.1923282279271618E-4,2.1928890659939367E-4,2.192327047112026E-4,2.1924420968899265E-4,2.1923

{"value":"I can't say that Wargames: The Dead Code is the worst movie I've ever seen, as it had one or two decent moments, but I can easily say it's the most transparent movie I've ever seen. Not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10+ minutes in advance. There was no subtlety to anything the movie did, no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes. Every spoken or typed line's intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to \"get into\" the movie.<br /><br />I found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line, and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience, far more often than I found myself enjoying the movie.","finished_norm":["i","ca","not","sai","that","wargam","the","dead","code","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","a","it","have","on","or","two","decent","moment","but","i","can","easili","sai","it","the","much","transpar","movi","i","have","ever","see","not","onc","do","a","plot","devic","present","itself","without","me","guess","it","+","minut","in","advanc","there","be","no","subtleti","to","anyth","the","movi","do","no","intellig","evid","at","all","behind","the","scene","everi","speak","or","typ","line","intent","be","so","glaringli","obviou","it","be","imposs","to","get","into","the","moviebr","br","i","find","myself","laugh","at","the","horribli","think","out","plot","line","and","the","bumbl","attempt","to","reclaim","the","audienc","far","much","often","than","i","find","myself","enjoi","the","movi"],"filtered":["ca","sai","wargam","dead","code","wrong","movi","ever","see","two","decent","moment","easili","sai","much","transpar","movi","ever","see","onc","plot","devic","present","without","guess","+","minut","advanc","subtleti","anyth","movi","intellig","evid","behind","scene","everi","speak","typ","line","intent","glaringli","obviou","imposs","get","moviebr","br","find","laugh","horribli","think","plot","line","bumbl","attempt","reclaim","audienc","far","much","often","find","enjoi","movi"],"filtered2":["ca","wargam","dead","code","wrong","ever","see","two","decent","moment","easili","transpar","ever","see","onc","plot","devic","present","without","guess","+","minut","advanc","subtleti","anyth","intellig","evid","behind","scene","everi","speak","typ","line","intent","glaringli","obviou","imposs","get","moviebr","find","laugh","horribli","think","plot","line","bumbl","attempt","reclaim","audienc","far","often","find","enjoi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,12,19,25,32,38,44,47,59,81,85,101,104,107,125,133,168,177,188,200,228,236,243,309,344,383,384,393,400,411,465,583,603,811,901,1015,1276,1555,1622,1747,1824,3132,4008,4124,6089,8416],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,12,19,25,32,38,44,47,59,81,85,101,104,107,125,133,168,177,188,200,228,236,243,309,344,383,384,393,400,411,465,583,603,811,901,1015,1276,1555,1622,1747,1824,3132,4008,4124,6089,8416],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,1.066728610262888,1.312380678011735,1.2796387880827016,2.742262257014735,3.038623282696244,3.209458785004948,1.7064694353107215,1.8693254449200722,1.949757232424728,2.011190219103739,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,4.287906797278791,2.2242236634876535,2.3212364753796515,2.4894767118610357,2.458149992634611,2.5378812223426954,2.5308211829319704,2.7742700004069256,2.617923930016232,2.627841366673578,2.848772527704847,2.983093497946387,3.0433232530252132,3.109204957709252,3.120015873813468,3.130944944345658,3.229006157521873,3.2681460658591432,3.4986697244709752,3.530930586689197,3.8425769395797067,3.8962296530720266,4.086456389373095,4.297765483040301,4.637773374493822,4.770124825978496,4.74221603786142,4.979216623837056,5.482320201509136,5.7959777603641776,5.850044981634453,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.318746545765171E-4,2.316691787225997E-4,2.3172637963242863E-4,2.3167979521786174E-4,2.317017209623568E-4,2.3166790136863873E-4,2.3173995330228218E-4,2.3163343296338687E-4,2.316692276835123E-4,2.319086327265584E-4,2.3374876022784924E-4,2.3166961034116844E-4,2.3188901610218275E-4,2.3191317493693827E-4,2.3180782283696826E-4,2.3168070777104295E-4,2.3176041489471834E-4,2.3186948213389037E-4,2.3169266844704964E-4,2.3169182135566603E-4,2.3190026336973306E-4,2.3171503451076985E-4,2.317153851913935E-4,2.318638245480848E-4,2.3169275202442922E-4,2.319159468717961E-4,2.3175073223857316E-4,2.3166865950389985E-4,2.317736881737757E-4,2.318444288443494E-4,2.3171617111051638E-4,2.3184027324578302E-4,2.3195410103209597E-4,2.3216939040434877E-4,2.3175033176679242E-4,2.3168056725302098E-4,2.317641011814397E-4,2.3170409657815978E-4,2.3163368018913944E-4,2.3169259669560062E-4,2.3192479227141042E-4,2.317975669238569E-4,2.3184080156982059E-4,2.3164520857154715E-4,2.3169265560915855E-4,2.316804801322819E-4,2.3175890187423546E-4,2.3179908915749506E-4,2.317519541225618E-4,2.3171522102838577E-4,2.3168105306030677E-4,2.3215572991360748E-4,2.3173935068699467E-4,2.3169260250549605E-4,2.3173810963694036E-4,2.3166889653243196E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908926E-4,2.3168137831085207E-4,2.3166876428991784E-4,2.3185410485865134E-4,2.3176103280889664E-4,2.3166866744629144E-4,2.3164511419405107E-4,2.3162181971902586E-4,2.3183124250942026E-4,2.316800167268866E-4,2.3178532984537479E-4,2.3185335296367434E-4,2.3174816560918507E-4,2.3169290937467284E-4,2.3164541786535974E-4,2.3170467704319538E-4,2.316452930982687E-4,2.316574494686231E-4,2.31645

{"value":"One of the worst films ever. Not funny, poor TV style cinematography, bad acting. Sad to see so many famous old actors barely able to walk, let alone act. Lead female Nancy Young can't act. Terrible direction. Sub-par with bad TV movies. Occasional weak jokes fall flat. Even the basic premise of the movie makes no sense. Somehow they are supposed to stop a wedding from happening but there's no logic behind their actions. Slow pacing made my wife stop watching but I suffered through it. The old men are supposed to be acting like they are young and horny, but it comes off as pathetic instead of funny. How did they even get the money to make this?","finished_norm":["on","of","the","wrong","film","ever","not","funni","poor","tv","styl","cinematographi","bad","act","sad","to","see","so","mani","famou","old","actor","bare","abl","to","walk","let","alon","act","lead","femal","nanci","young","ca","not","act","terribl","direct","subpar","with","bad","tv","movi","occasion","weak","joke","fall","flat","even","the","basic","premis","of","the","movi","make","no","sens","somehow","thei","be","suppos","to","stop","a","wed","from","happen","but","there","no","logic","behind","their","action","slow","pace","make","my","wife","stop","watch","but","i","suffer","through","it","the","old","man","be","suppos","to","be","act","like","thei","be","young","and","horni","but","it","come","off","a","pathet","instead","of","funni","how","do","thei","even","get","the","monei","to","make","thi"],"filtered":["wrong","film","ever","funni","poor","tv","styl","cinematographi","bad","act","sad","see","mani","famou","old","actor","bare","abl","walk","let","alon","act","lead","femal","nanci","young","ca","act","terribl","direct","subpar","bad","tv","movi","occasion","weak","joke","fall","flat","even","basic","premis","movi","make","sens","somehow","thei","suppos","stop","wed","happen","logic","behind","action","slow","pace","make","wife","stop","watch","suffer","old","man","suppos","act","like","thei","young","horni","come","pathet","instead","funni","thei","even","get","monei","make","thi"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","funni","poor","tv","styl","cinematographi","bad","act","sad","see","mani","famou","old","actor","bare","abl","walk","let","alon","act","lead","femal","nanci","young","ca","act","terribl","direct","subpar","bad","tv","occasion","weak","joke","fall","flat","even","basic","premis","make","sens","somehow","suppos","stop","wed","happen","logic","behind","action","slow","pace","make","wife","stop","watch","suffer","old","man","suppos","act","like","young","horni","come","pathet","instead","funni","even","get","monei","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,7,9,21,25,34,41,44,45,50,62,67,81,94,102,124,126,129,135,146,149,152,157,166,169,172,173,214,263,286,294,315,379,380,390,393,422,454,455,457,484,546,549,593,594,602,629,633,865,973,1099,1497,2629,3377,3709],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,7,9,21,25,34,41,44,45,50,62,67,81,94,102,124,126,129,135,146,149,152,157,166,169,172,173,214,263,286,294,315,379,380,390,393,422,454,455,457,484,546,549,593,594,602,629,633,865,973,1099,1497,2629,3377,3709],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,4.648062181340196,1.2796387880827016,1.3982850089458962,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,1.717994385570355,4.045224089013853,3.9141830778533158,1.949757232424728,2.08112281984698,2.087553710177271,2.2323930368088845,2.2391270689902285,2.4106958340079214,4.732488142874176,2.326138445979858,4.650639560718045,2.3131195476980753,2.3360150694757706,2.4423870329693536,2.4071371113909277,5.000281788719697,2.4368824319140248,2.7303758068497004,2.902686292364678,2.780700890737216,2.886778509330039,5.708625416160924,3.1272886331425473,3.102062070196872,3.132778125427319,3.120015873813468,3.2090054908152035,3.2556198060399626,3.2787058260741455,3.3243163373261977,3.291526514503207,3.4572130107926293,3.4471119148061256,3.490764544963862,3.496027715008137,3.506637894120152,3.488143311483988,3.550241531602284,3.9201351739255808,4.072271754381138,4.135246553542527,4.770124825978496,5.2288713006995975,5.583416318380505,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6833549634637514E-4,1.681863257528079E-4,1.6822785225584507E-4,1.6819403307641624E-4,1.6820995064657535E-4,1.6818539842414654E-4,1.6823770641802684E-4,1.6816037517994187E-4,1.6818636129726852E-4,1.6836016367693173E-4,1.6969605257274978E-4,1.6818663909764557E-4,1.68345922473179E-4,1.6836346121387125E-4,1.682869780895213E-4,1.6819469556836897E-4,1.6825256104853863E-4,1.6833174127578115E-4,1.682033787352977E-4,1.6820276376705646E-4,1.6835408772249909E-4,1.6821961596676454E-4,1.6821987055257493E-4,1.683276340027528E-4,1.682034394104918E-4,1.6836547357279417E-4,1.6824553166996714E-4,1.6818594881235396E-4,1.6826219713413125E-4,1.6831355318214195E-4,1.682204411112066E-4,1.6831053631620392E-4,1.6839317258769291E-4,1.6854946756267612E-4,1.6824524093695837E-4,1.681945935556198E-4,1.6825523720521494E-4,1.6821167528726993E-4,1.6816055465997105E-4,1.682033266454485E-4,1.6837189512299412E-4,1.6827953253999696E-4,1.6831091986691695E-4,1.6816892399200615E-4,1.6820336941529343E-4,1.6819453030803081E-4,1.6825146263157523E-4,1.6828063764549243E-4,1.68246418728745E-4,1.6821975137412725E-4

No amount of denial or ad-dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact.<br /><br />Maybe Peter Sollett saw he didn't have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current \"edgy film-making\". Maybe he just doesn't know any better. It's hard to tell.<br /><br />What's not hard to tell is the result.

{"value":"Last of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films and a good thing too, as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years. No mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people, who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride. She finds Tarzan and Jane, who try to protect her. George Zucco is present as a potentially villainous High Priest but isn't used to his full advantage.

Acting in this movie also dissatisfied me, Will Smith didn't show anything new in this movie, yet I never saw his acting to change since \"Men In Black\" which was his only success by my opinion.

{"value":"Have you ever heard the saying that people \"telegraph their intentions?\" Well in this movie, the characters' actions do more than telegraph future plans -- they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head. This could be forgiven if the setting had been used better, or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced. Embeth Davidtz's character is not mysterious, just wooden, and Kenneth Branagh doesn't succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have.<br /><br />The bottom line: obvious plot, one-note performances, unlikeable characters, and grotesque \"Southern\" accents employed by British

{"value":"\"It's not like that big mechanical toy\", says a character early on, commenting on \"Jaws\". Well, \"Blood Surf\" would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the \"Jaws\" series. In other words, the digital special effects of this movie are TERRIBLE. Acting and directing are not much better, either; they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble-gum commercial than to a horror movie. The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre, but for the audience too. Saying you \"liked\" this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap, further destroying the poor horror genre.

{"value":"Oh dear. While Chevy Chase and the gang at SNL set new highs with the sketch show format this fails miserably at every level. Fortunately Chevy is barely in this at all and can't be blamed for this utter tripe. It seriously is very, very bad. While meant to be a political comment on USA at the time of it's release (1974) it still remains neither funny or acutely observed. The sketches are all way too long and any satirical impact they may have had is lost as they're all drawn out to the point of complete boredom. This is credited as Chevy's movie debut and I'm pleased to say that everything he did after this bettered it.

{"value":"I actually like Asylum movies. I've made it a habit to see as many as possible. Even the rip-offs they've done have been cool like EXORCISM And WHEN A KILLER CALLS. This is just plain lame. I can't believe that the same people who made DEAD MEN WALKING and DRACULA'S CURSE actually made this movie too!!! It's not even laughably bad like JOLLY ROGER or ALIEN ABDUCTION (which, by the way are pretty bad). This is just BAD! I mean, I can appreciate and/or forgive bad acting or lame special effects in an Asylum movie, but this film takes itself way too seriously. I really hope that SNAKES ON A TRAIN is better. Now that's a movie I can't wait to see.","finished_norm":["i","actual","like","asylum","movi","i","have","make","it","a","habit","to","see","a","mani","a","possibl","even","the","ripoff","thei","have","do","have","be","cool","like","exorc","and","when","a","killer","call","thi","be","just","plain","lame","i","ca","not","believ","that","the","same","peopl","who","make","dead","man","walk","and","dracula","curs","actual","make","thi","movi","too","it","not","even","laughabl","bad","like","jolli","roger","or","alien","abduct","which","by","the","wai","be","pretti","bad","thi","be","just","bad","i","mean","i","can","appreci","andor","forgiv","bad","act","or","lame","special","effect","in","a","asylum","movi","but","thi","film","take","itself","wai","too","serious","i","realli","hope","that","snake","on","a","train","be","well","now","that","a","movi","i","ca","not","wait","to","see"],"filtered":["actual","like","asylum","movi","make","habit","see","mani","possibl","even","ripoff","thei","cool","like","exorc","killer","call","thi","plain","lame","ca","believ","peopl","make","dead","man","walk","dracula","curs","actual","make","thi","movi","even","laughabl","bad","like","jolli","roger","alien","abduct","wai","pretti","bad","thi","bad","mean","appreci","andor","forgiv","bad","act","lame","special","effect","asylum","movi","thi","film","take","wai","serious","realli","hope","snake","train","well","movi","ca","wait","see"],"filtered2":["actual","like","asylum","make","habit","see","mani","possibl","even","ripoff","cool","like","exorc","killer","call","plain","lame","ca","believ","peopl","make","dead","man","walk","dracula","curs","actual","make","even","laughabl","bad","like","jolli","roger","alien","abduct","wai","pretti","bad","bad","mean","appreci","andor","forgiv","bad","act","lame","special","effect","asylum","take","wai","serious","realli","hope","snake","train","well","ca","wait","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,9,13,20,21,23,31,33,45,50,52,78,81,88,91,106,142,181,203,228,252,294,331,371,373,402,481,552,565,586,713,961,1311,1414,1479,1566,1646,2114,2145,3054,3358,4219,5983,6292],"values":[3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,9,13,20,21,23,31,33,45,50,52,78,81,88,91,106,142,181,203,228,252,294,331,371,373,402,481,552,565,586,713,961,1311,1414,1479,1566,1646,2114,2145,3054,3358,4219,5983,6292],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.9381148836729736,1.3114004109387893,1.852034211452262,4.273428342688829,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.4070669811451506,2.803707089537043,1.8162961064622165,1.717994385570355,3.4244306149452273,2.0064197866819473,3.899514464849456,2.0317223413467334,2.0105926690411424,2.159084361316692,2.2844323215331563,2.4442286541160034,2.569760528637609,2.7742700004069256,3.0433232530252132,2.886778509330039,2.932274249550174,3.0466846007279185,6.141071633100196,3.084424928710765,3.353630724994973,3.424750734647968,3.9081109809587793,3.4572130107926293,3.865219416329466,3.9954846111673676,4.456830177669989,4.484804029712395,4.715065048795469,4.74221603786142,5.143104478942172,4.9676558014359795,5.626901430320244,11.344727608794,5.604922523601468,5.9370563586240825,6.725513718988353,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079215E-4,1.9803239209117214E-4,1.980812878185437E-4,1.9804146714364116E-4,1.9806020941939265E-4,1.9803130020030503E-4,1.980928906839977E-4,1.9800183637269864E-4,1.9803243394329376E-4,1.9823707900490495E-4,1.9981003252786677E-4,1.9803276104166486E-4,1.9822031058076118E-4,1.98240961717279E-4,1.981509060245713E-4,1.9804224720031672E-4,1.981103813925955E-4,1.9820361281160044E-4,1.980524712676428E-4,1.9805174716815775E-4,1.9822992482167903E-4,1.9807158993126735E-4,1.980718896954533E-4,1.9819877666871463E-4,1.980525427101562E-4,1.9824333118607777E-4,1.9810210459216479E-4,1.980319482594906E-4,1.9812172748195065E-4,1.98182197089039E-4,1.9807256150447316E-4,1.9817864485507675E-4,1.9827594562220636E-4,1.9845997644414871E-4,1.9810176226615865E-4,1.9804212708455436E-4,1.981135324555957E-4,1.980622401119636E-4,1.9800204770295603E-4,1.980524099340154E-4,1.982508922939225E-4,1.9814213920018092E-4,1.9817909647006296E-4,1.9801190224276894E-4,1.9805246029372606E-4,1.9804205261315315E-4,1.981090880523801E-4,1.9814344041586422E-4,1.981031490669217E-4,1.98071749367796E-4,1.9804254235593154E-4,1.9844829936360844E-4,1.9809237556434495E-4,1.980524149003536E-4,1.9809131470630457E-4,1.9803215087309449E-4,0.9843481445040683,1.980630471957058E-4,1.9804282038231327E-4,1.980320378312926E-4,1.9819046821197686E-4,1.981109095898443E-4,1.9803195504870105E-4,1.9801182156824236E-4,1.9799190929231002E-4,1.9817092532011692E-4,1.9804165649106454E-4,1.9813167886213604E-4,1.9818982548702865E-4,1.9809991061988012E-4,1.9805267721421628E-4,1.9801208114854563E-

{"value":"If you have plenty of time to waste ... it's OK. It moves at a good pace but to pull this movie off it would need to be a little longer with a little more background on the sitter. <br /><br />The acting is OK.

Like most of these sitter movies ... there are parts that are interesting ... but overall it leaves you wondering why you spent the time.","finished_norm":["if","you","have","plenti","of","time","to","wast","it","okai","it","move","at","a","good","pace","but","to","pull","thi","movi","off","it","would","ne","to","be","a","littl","long","with","a","littl","much","background","on","the","sitter","br","br","the","act","be","okai","mariana","klaveno","a","the","sitter","doe","the","well","job","and","be","the","much","believablebr","br","william","r","mose","plai","a","pretti","good","part","a","the","husbandbr","br","gail","o","gradi","a","the","wife","have","a","weak","part","and","the","reason","for","her","go","back","to","work","be","not","developedbr","br","the","end","be","sort","of","silli","like","much","of","thi","sitter","movi","there","be","part","that","be","interest","but","overal","it","leav","you","wonder","why","you","spend","the","time"],"filtered":["plenti","time","wast","okai","move","good","pace","pull","thi","movi","ne","littl","long","littl","much","background","sitter","br","br","act","okai","mariana","klaveno","sitter","doe","well","job","much","believablebr","br","william","r","mose","plai","pretti","good","part","husbandbr","br","gail","o","gradi","wife","weak","part","reason","go","back","work","developedbr","br","end","sort","silli","like","much","thi","sitter","movi","part","interest","overal","leav","wonder","spend","time"],"filtered2":["plenti","time","wast","okai","move","good","pace","pull","ne","littl","long","littl","background","sitter","act","okai","mariana","klaveno","sitter","doe","well","job","believablebr","william","r","mose","plai","pretti","good","part","husbandbr","gail","o","gradi","wife","weak","part","reason","go","back","work","developedbr","end","sort","silli","like","sitter","part","interest","overal","leav","wonder","spend","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,14,18,20,21,24,40,48,60,61,63,74,78,89,95,99,110,175,191,263,269,275,283,289,379,385,412,544,546,720,801,888,994,1602,5580,7345,7662,8572],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,14,18,20,21,24,40,48,60,61,63,74,78,89,95,99,110,175,191,263,269,275,283,289,379,385,412,544,546,720,801,888,994,1602,5580,7345,7662,8572],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,2.2350163994518417,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.6284968758320737,1.6955116224012472,1.838176641236591,5.645555114217758,1.8729627573220065,1.9486336368009016,2.0064197866819473,1.9940046109572438,2.0323326556775485,2.056430207256609,2.1290479736304078,2.3791142619576227,5.092022696851891,2.902686292364678,2.76533567167316,2.7832848715031413,2.7678802023081546,2.8282659991423613,3.1272886331425473,3.09496984188738,3.107414446935464,3.4222967456864013,3.4572130107926293,3.857614816944247,3.7881170224473255,3.9323057095458362,4.140259095366071,4.724033718778229,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040352E-4,2.558082347393933E-4,2.5587139576862254E-4,2.558199574334826E-4,2.558441677579874E-4,2.558068242899597E-4,2.558863837637599E-4,2.5576876440667974E-4,2.558082888018486E-4,2.560726389488427E-4,2.581045008063247E-4,2.558087113309915E-4,2.5605097834607827E-4,2.560776544404394E-4,2.559613250483812E-4,2.5582096507126886E-4,2.559089773770749E-4,2.560294090118497E-4,2.558341720046747E-4,2.558332366495588E-4,2.56063397536553E-4,2.558588685280097E-4,2.558592557482338E-4,2.5602316192690816E-4,2.5583426429050244E-4,2.56080715200471E-4,2.5589828582462174E-4,2.558076614200601E-4,2.559236336818263E-4,2.560017452638827E-4,2.558601235571697E-4,2.5599715666759464E-4,2.5612284488059546E-4,2.56360566594713E-4,2.558978436251895E-4,2.558208099117982E-4,2.55913047760991E-4,2.558467909040111E-4,2.557690373924247E-4,2.5583409277699483E-4,2.5609048225741564E-4,2.5595000050774474E-4,2.5599774004100737E-4,2.557817669888664E-4,2.5583415782912366E-4,2.5582071371340617E-4,2.559073067055553E-4,2.559516813523957E-4,2.558996350243207E-4,2.5585907448005883E-4,2.558213463383737E-4,2.563454827322783E-4,2.5588571835822877E-4,2.558340991922595E-4,2.558843479954323E-4,2.558079231460727E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.5584783345399594E-4,2.55821705478801E-4,2.558077771243866E-4,2.560124294824376E-4,2.5590965967558365E-4,2.55807670190019E-4,2.5578166277759063E-4,2.5575594110598875E-4,2.5598718496251026E-4,2.558202020229137E-4,2.559364883717665E-4,2.560115992428354E-4,2.5589545176211666E-4,2.558344380360489E-4,2.557819980903061E-4,2.5584743185131753E-4,2.55781860322954E-4,2.557952833413216E-4,2.557820053295742E-4,2.5594804359407847E-4,2.5587186526541923E-4,2.558080116274146E-4,2.5583279142898756E-4]}}

{"value":"I cant help it but i seem to like films that are meant to be scary and are just plain bad. I have personally listed it in my own top 10 worst movies right under creatures of the abyss!. Watch this film and have a laugh just don't expect to see any academy awards for acting. More chance of understanding the film its self. In all honesty though i have seen much worse than this.
