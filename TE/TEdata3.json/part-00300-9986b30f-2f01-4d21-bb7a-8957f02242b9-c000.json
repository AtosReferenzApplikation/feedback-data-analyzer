{"value":"The last reviewer was very generous. I quiet like the first movie, but can't say I enjoy this one very much. The beginning is bearable, but it goes downhill pretty quickly. I just don't see Jon Bon Jovi as a \"bad-ass vampire hunter\" and the vampire princess is neither sexy nor scary. A lot of the scenes just do not make sense. I mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you, let alone an experienced hunter. Why Una is able to communicate with Jovi? Nothing was ever explain in this movie, you wouldn't mind if it was entertaining, but that was too much to ask. This has to be one of worst vampire movie I have seen.","finished_norm":["the","last","review","be","veri","gener","i","quiet","like","the","movi","but","ca","not","sai","i","enjoi","thi","on","veri","much","the","begin","be","bearabl","but","it","go","downhil","pretti","quickli","i","just","do","not","see","jon","bon","jovi","a","a","badass","vampir","hunter","and","the","vampir","princess","be","neither","sexi","nor","scari","a","lot","of","the","scene","just","do","not","make","sens","i","mean","ani","normal","person","would","suspect","someth","be","up","when","a","strang","woman","suddenli","appear","out","of","nowher","to","seduc","you","let","alon","a","experi","hunter","why","una","be","abl","to","commun","with","jovi","noth","be","ever","explain","in","thi","movi","you","would","not","mind","if","it","be","entertain","but","that","be","too","much","to","ask","thi","have","to","be","on","of","wrong","vampir","movi","i","have","see"],"filtered":["last","review","veri","gener","quiet","like","movi","ca","sai","enjoi","thi","veri","much","begin","bearabl","go","downhil","pretti","quickli","see","jon","bon","jovi","badass","vampir","hunter","vampir","princess","neither","sexi","scari","lot","scene","make","sens","mean","ani","normal","person","suspect","someth","strang","woman","suddenli","appear","nowher","seduc","let","alon","experi","hunter","una","abl","commun","jovi","noth","ever","explain","thi","movi","mind","entertain","much","ask","thi","wrong","vampir","movi","see"],"filtered2":["last","review","veri","gener","quiet","like","ca","enjoi","veri","begin","bearabl","go","downhil","pretti","quickli","see","jon","bon","jovi","badass","vampir","hunter","vampir","princess","neither","sexi","scari","lot","scene","make","sens","mean","ani","normal","person","suspect","someth","strang","woman","suddenli","appear","nowher","seduc","let","alon","experi","hunter","una","abl","commun","jovi","noth","ever","explain","mind","entertain","ask","wrong","vampir","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,15,19,25,27,44,49,53,70,72,78,81,88,124,144,147,153,169,173,176,195,200,225,238,306,333,395,396,417,454,457,485,700,718,771,785,799,977,1061,1087,1260,2247,2526,2567,2660,2969,4704,5207,5808,5909],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,15,19,25,27,44,49,53,70,72,78,81,88,124,144,147,153,169,173,176,195,200,225,238,306,333,395,396,417,454,457,485,700,718,771,785,799,977,1061,1087,1260,2247,2526,2567,2660,2969,4704,5207,5808,5909],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.9708269144703846,2.4001215597131385,1.312380678011735,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,2.094675786251684,1.9209463754160525,2.0064197866819473,1.949757232424728,2.0317223413467334,2.2323930368088845,2.2931108769894046,2.2844323215331563,2.3409902041158843,2.4214486257841834,2.4368824319140248,2.5040471493269134,2.51289241584188,2.5308211829319704,2.641219492619754,2.597304642813496,2.8739486825973213,2.948928684455311,3.153168081130368,3.291526514503207,3.1932880749197934,3.2556198060399626,3.3243163373261977,12.48169308458045,3.616452760127359,3.634471265630037,3.7264536553416874,3.7952092507568174,3.7636829971100436,4.035401218572811,4.218628162481577,4.176068548062782,9.178753667263944,5.014723312293965,5.143104478942172,5.444579873526289,5.3064295350454715,5.521540914662417,6.101359409915359,6.600350576034347,13.897314540605125,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.619498352242294E-5,6.574861527340739E-5,0.02136640330249549,6.587689853242765E-5,6.5877977851241E-5,6.578589360314039E-5,6.598155006817283E-5,6.575808264439243E-5,6.590593078584133E-5,7.311903254388427E-5,0.3567886714510938,6.565193460094859E-5,6.687729540367302E-5,6.783131471795772E-5,6.56998073067852E-5,6.551824138618699E-5,6.715251196097007E-5,6.59877320413646E-5,6.578300535976508E-5,6.583752777518913E-5,6.64745444709005E-5,6.605310918578597E-5,6.612832067127523E-5,6.619956651990471E-5,6.67076141831232E-5,6.635875214057608E-5,6.914834801746566E-5,6.567145231914525E-5,6.567320918428928E-5,6.583959188837465E-5,6.723899700074677E-5,6.59839086157794E-5,7.082813628858008E-5,0.047782454101713605,6.574293274167187E-5,6.604637971446215E-5,6.567705668016084E-5,6.57158669884899E-5,6.551791221724489E-5,6.553491058639543E-5,6.568242170547094E-5,6.637523207743136E-5,6.603795163027373E-5,6.577685602971241E-5,6.657611380171905E-5,6.580210154649257E-5,6.798837862039353E-5,6.698858969530511E-5,6.555119959433502E-5,6.569607175416948E-5,6.567328588137442E-5,6.752157901472928E-5,6.569704918647319E-5,6.552909258387994E-5,6.624836815434442E-5,6.571397100232078E-5,0.5278917352237281,6.565981415150797E-5,6.555044153231724E-5,6.586342565157984E-5,6.65167354798118E-5,6.585906841133562E-5,6.553

{"value":"My wife and I really had high hopes for this film, but it was a major disappointment. It was a Native American version of Mr. Magoo. A pathetic father who fails at everything he tries e.g. fishing, hunting, in an obvious way he subjects his family to his wild fantasies. His \"visions\" are not only ridiculous but in the process he lies to his son numerous times about various obvious things. Words cannot express how bad this film is. The children and wife are very real which makes the film even sadder. I don't get the humor... unless you like laughing at other people making a fool of themselves. I don't get how this could have come up for awards.

{"value":"Another horror flick in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over?! Yes, but the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a slightly different feel. \"The Brain\" has troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly \"brain\". Can Jim stop him? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they're entitled to make at least one ridiculous horror movie. But still, they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all.<br /><br />The bad guy had a brain.

The young actors were alright at playing their characters, but I'd have to say the killer was definitely at the top of the game - acting wise.<br /><br />Yes, I'll give props for the plot because it was good, but it's not thrilling or scary. There were almost zero \"jump-in-your-seat\" scenes. So, don't waste ten dollars seeing it in theatres, wait 'til it comes to DVD.","finished_norm":["so","prom","night","be","suppos","to","be","a","horror","and","thriller","movi","i","be","a","big","wuss","and","be","scare","to","see","thi","movi","at","the","begin","but","upon","see","it","it","be","neither","horror","or","thrillerbr","br","i","be","basic","make","fun","of","the","movi","in","my","seat","becaus","it","be","so","predict","you","can","predict","what","be","go","to","happen","next","the","young","actor","be","alright","at","plai","their","charact","but","i","have","have","to","sai","the","killer","be","definit","at","the","top","of","the","game","act","wisebr","br","ye","i","will","give","prop","for","the","plot","becaus","it","be","good","but","it","not","thrill","or","scari","there","be","almost","zero","jumpinyourseat","scene","so","do","not","wast","ten","dollar","see","it","in","theatr","wait","til","it","come","to","dvd"],"filtered":["prom","night","suppos","horror","thriller","movi","big","wuss","scare","see","thi","movi","begin","upon","see","neither","horror","thrillerbr","br","basic","make","fun","movi","seat","becaus","predict","predict","go","happen","next","young","actor","alright","plai","charact","sai","killer","definit","top","game","act","wisebr","br","ye","give","prop","plot","becaus","good","thrill","scari","almost","zero","jumpinyourseat","scene","wast","ten","dollar","see","theatr","wait","til","come","dvd"],"filtered2":["prom","night","suppos","horror","thriller","big","wuss","scare","see","begin","upon","see","neither","horror","thrillerbr","basic","make","fun","seat","becaus","predict","predict","go","happen","next","young","actor","alright","plai","charact","killer","definit","top","game","act","wisebr","ye","give","prop","plot","becaus","good","thrill","scari","almost","zero","jumpinyourseat","scene","wast","ten","dollar","see","theatr","wait","til","come","dvd"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,10,19,21,22,30,32,34,40,41,82,83,89,94,131,135,147,149,209,210,247,252,259,286,297,331,337,364,374,392,396,545,623,630,714,718,964,1039,1118,1218,1551,1751,1893,2055,6896,8125],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,10,19,21,22,30,32,34,40,41,82,83,89,94,131,135,147,149,209,210,247,252,259,286,297,331,337,364,374,392,396,545,623,630,714,718,964,1039,1118,1218,1551,1751,1893,2055,6896,8125],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,2.5958480334723544,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,2.020196584395323,4.584637595480144,1.9940046109572438,2.08112281984698,2.2512118082053005,2.366244071437088,2.2844323215331563,2.3253197803590226,2.6026896854443837,2.687151791517189,2.7303758068497004,3.0433232530252132,2.7464553122240485,2.780700890737216,2.813490713560207,2.932274249550174,5.947318931426056,2.9878441007049847,3.4572130107926293,3.0670934723591254,3.291526514503207,3.442099372982581,3.607563812710113,3.558633189238533,3.7297814454343623,3.634471265630037,4.062925891962901,4.145296889396028,4.34596758485818,4.297765483040301,4.573751515728891,4.751432692966343,5.719991853386255,4.933754249760298,6.660975197850782,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.338626200189637E-5,8.28239689431009E-5,8.34678463249087E-5,8.298556821963064E-5,8.29869278447346E-5,8.287092870356457E-5,8.311739845682062E-5,8.283589505344068E-5,8.302214034278613E-5,9.210853271024951E-5,0.8315293645779828,8.27021796555269E-5,8.42457748270284E-5,8.544755931676795E-5,8.276248522219086E-5,8.25337654216868E-5,8.459246695886129E-5,8.31251859296596E-5,8.286729036413153E-5,8.293597261429006E-5,8.373842679225925E-5,8.320754195429414E-5,8.330228636392808E-5,8.339203523437463E-5,8.403202626239922E-5,8.359256242187275E-5,8.710663494356058E-5,8.27267662552452E-5,8.272897938997848E-5,8.293857279142932E-5,8.470141273998111E-5,8.312036953496279E-5,8.922267542622666E-5,8.335417486867507E-5,8.281681061999366E-5,8.319906479440857E-5,8.273382610617546E-5,8.278271571028881E-5,8.25333507653762E-5,8.255476372430699E-5,8.274058446432211E-5,8.361332230818534E-5,8.318844788057444E-5,8.285954401207248E-5,8.386637435535703E-5,8.289134595784819E-5,8.56454137616613E-5,8.438597298809003E-5,8.257528309619175E-5,8.275777952165948E-5,8.27290760058079E-5,8.505738318669914E-5,8.275901079964808E-5,8.254743474775518E-5,8.345351097859218E-5,8.278032732387286E-5,8.902114424353017E-5,8.2712105577892E-5,8.257432816041468E-5,8.296859634181581E-5,0.07688318763183595,8.296310749723461E-5,8.255905172509984E-5,8.275127783251964E-5,8.253434902086345E-5,8.444402278897681E-5,8.324534369435467E-5,8.30680189240948E-5,8.299537218724694E-5,8.329790351173274E-5,8.25313380369159E-5,8.299711214634607E-5,8.434327020817474E-5

{"value":"This is not Michael Madsen's fault, he was hardly in it. This movie was just awful. If you want to laugh and be bored, go ahead and watch this movie. Words cannot describe how idiotic it is. Sorry Michael. The cinematography was dark. All the other actors are unknowns. When watching it, it feels like a soft porn, but with no nudity or heated scenes. This movie had sexual overtones, since it is about a underground S & M killer. The acting was bad, except Michael Madsen's parts. He looked like he wanted to laugh. I hope he got paid well for this lousy movie. It is something I would not be proud of. It is not even a B movie for cable, it is more like a F and it should never be shown, ever.","finished_norm":["thi","be","not","michael","madsen","fault","he","be","hardli","in","it","thi","movi","be","just","aw","if","you","want","to","laugh","and","be","bore","go","ahead","and","watch","thi","movi","word","cannot","describ","how","idiot","it","be","sorri","michael","the","cinematographi","be","dark","all","the","other","actor","be","unknown","when","watch","it","it","feel","like","a","soft","porn","but","with","no","nuditi","or","heat","scene","thi","movi","have","sexual","overton","sinc","it","be","about","a","underground","be","killer","the","act","be","bad","except","michael","madsen","part","he","look","like","he","want","to","laugh","i","hope","he","get","pai","good","for","thi","lousi","movi","it","be","someth","i","would","not","be","proud","of","it","be","not","even","a","b","movi","for","cabl","it","be","much","like","a","f","and","it","should","never","be","show","ever"],"filtered":["thi","michael","madsen","fault","hardli","thi","movi","aw","want","laugh","bore","go","ahead","watch","thi","movi","word","describ","idiot","sorri","michael","cinematographi","dark","actor","unknown","watch","feel","like","soft","porn","nuditi","heat","scene","thi","movi","sexual","overton","sinc","underground","killer","act","bad","except","michael","madsen","part","look","like","want","laugh","hope","get","pai","good","thi","lousi","movi","someth","proud","even","b","movi","cabl","much","like","f","never","show","ever"],"filtered2":["michael","madsen","fault","hardli","aw","want","laugh","bore","go","ahead","watch","word","describ","idiot","sorri","michael","cinematographi","dark","actor","unknown","watch","feel","like","soft","porn","nuditi","heat","scene","sexual","overton","sinc","underground","killer","act","bad","except","michael","madsen","part","look","like","want","laugh","hope","get","pai","good","lousi","someth","proud","even","b","cabl","like","f","never","show","ever"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,7,9,16,19,21,28,37,41,42,43,44,53,61,108,133,138,162,181,233,252,258,322,368,437,466,519,612,629,642,665,668,706,971,1096,1117,1298,1322,1511,1535,1989,2284,2681,2879,3514,6842],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,7,9,16,19,21,28,37,41,42,43,44,53,61,108,133,138,162,181,233,252,258,322,368,437,466,519,612,629,642,665,668,706,971,1096,1117,1298,1322,1511,1535,1989,2284,2681,2879,3514,6842],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.5452294193519092,2.975308642954861,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.7003182735607676,1.8818517047392527,2.138507503627933,4.642472950759303,2.2907365189289424,2.3586007221245198,2.4442286541160034,2.6102777977348763,3.0433232530252132,2.7061321952397077,2.885344817328191,3.1346146732346205,3.1952392950510555,10.3338075096021,3.5614461306151473,3.5929222627171646,3.488143311483988,3.622422927113863,3.5929222627171646,3.5813614403160887,3.6590123745461547,4.181290492043933,4.429617614145104,4.224077767249142,4.3521595551061,4.3521595551061,4.566029469634981,4.558366596889411,4.956227105612356,5.185068678041204,5.243909178064138,5.426230734858092,12.202718819830718,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.505102642787588E-5,7.454493981117503E-5,7.512445563594328E-5,7.469038573095116E-5,7.469160944882938E-5,7.458720550505546E-5,7.480903830486213E-5,7.455567379541662E-5,7.472330212887537E-5,8.290142472764392E-5,0.7545299283281582,7.443532450020042E-5,7.582462291973703E-5,7.690627782708859E-5,7.448960196232413E-5,7.42837448417373E-5,7.613665993547393E-5,7.481604734706898E-5,7.45839308516247E-5,7.464574766950361E-5,7.53679890588173E-5,7.489017111797506E-5,7.497544493911323E-5,7.505622257185567E-5,7.563224052019333E-5,7.523670519437793E-5,7.839951335201748E-5,7.445745343967953E-5,7.445944535092928E-5,7.464808793465653E-5,7.623471556840113E-5,7.481171239599912E-5,8.030403582819483E-5,7.50221467032597E-5,7.453849702930901E-5,7.488254132938242E-5,7.446380759258223E-5,7.450781022421808E-5,7.428337163419712E-5,7.43026441679219E-5,7.446989038972046E-5,7.525538993619128E-5,7.487298567523006E-5,7.457695881979182E-5,7.54831470681692E-5,7.460558186411075E-5,7.708435487258832E-5,7.595080696538639E-5,7.432111243697048E-5,7.448536664050415E-5,7.445953230910432E-5,7.65551034448066E-5,7.448647484075973E-5,7.429604779101672E-5,0.21470365951414905,0.024976435749111486,8.012264956916993E-5,7.444425823393377E-5,7.432025295594182E-5,7.467511035081262E-5,7.541582468557213E-5,7.467017016750386E-5,7.430650354299281E-5,7.447951485590864E-5,7.42842701047264E-5,7.600305414658738E-5,7.49241942211121E-5,7.476459471755373E-5,7.469920

{"value":"i think this one sucked on ice, because it left the cube, and gave us to much information as to the who's and why's. The original CUBE never left the cube, and it left everything to your imagination. This crap fest however, gives you it all. and i didn't like it...Though the acting is solid, I think the reason this one was a downer was because it was done by people other than the ORIGINAL filmmakers, if they had Vincenzo Natali do this prequel, or even the sequel i think it would have done better and would have been more true to the source. so i recommend you stay far, far away from this one, and HYPERCUBE, another movie i don't even want to discuss...(i gave it a 2 for the acting only)","finished_norm":["i","think","thi","on","suck","on","ic","becaus","it","leav","the","cube","and","give","u","to","much","inform","a","to","the","who","and","why","the","origin","cube","never","leav","the","cube","and","it","leav","everyth","to","your","imagin","thi","crap","fest","howev","give","you","it","all","and","i","do","not","like","itthough","the","act","be","solid","i","think","the","reason","thi","on","be","a","downer","be","becaus","it","be","do","by","peopl","other","than","the","origin","filmmak","if","thei","have","vincenzo","natali","do","thi","prequel","or","even","the","sequel","i","think","it","would","have","do","well","and","would","have","be","much","true","to","the","sourc","so","i","recommend","you","stai","far","far","awai","from","thi","on","and","hypercub","anoth","movi","i","do","not","even","want","to","discussi","give","it","a","for","the","act","onli"],"filtered":["think","thi","suck","ic","becaus","leav","cube","give","u","much","inform","origin","cube","never","leav","cube","leav","everyth","imagin","thi","crap","fest","howev","give","like","itthough","act","solid","think","reason","thi","downer","becaus","peopl","origin","filmmak","thei","vincenzo","natali","thi","prequel","even","sequel","think","well","much","true","sourc","recommend","stai","far","far","awai","thi","hypercub","anoth","movi","even","want","discussi","give","act","onli"],"filtered2":["think","suck","ic","becaus","leav","cube","give","u","inform","origin","cube","never","leav","cube","leav","everyth","imagin","crap","fest","howev","give","like","itthough","act","solid","think","reason","downer","becaus","peopl","origin","filmmak","vincenzo","natali","prequel","even","sequel","think","well","true","sourc","recommend","stai","far","far","awai","hypercub","anoth","even","want","discussi","give","act","onli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,11,12,20,21,22,23,30,37,42,69,73,74,95,101,112,113,155,193,298,304,313,323,340,365,387,421,1044,1520,1588,1978,2368,2522,2832,5048,7963],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,11,12,20,21,22,23,30,37,42,69,73,74,95,101,112,113,155,193,298,304,313,323,340,365,387,421,1044,1520,1588,1978,2368,2522,2832,5048,7963],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.852034211452262,0.9913098153388195,3.200185830788664,1.165345040023057,2.324031090670098,2.5958480334723544,1.364847727375781,4.009325967515556,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,4.254065042302116,1.8950689206770979,5.845900910402705,2.0323326556775485,4.197164082437498,2.2466628996789315,2.1521782565202803,2.3074766467914385,2.517840471459249,2.7819920465008363,2.871119826396843,2.907069060519773,3.0433232530252132,2.948928684455311,3.008694896185175,3.360519385990158,3.2597778161886266,4.125296222689358,4.550761997504193,4.654440426979034,4.979216623837056,17.55013494490336,5.501738287366237,5.3560264761848435,6.342521466732247,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.236664266974484E-5,9.174379280466447E-5,9.245701331150552E-5,9.192279570361409E-5,9.192430175512818E-5,9.179580995125998E-5,9.206882355183827E-5,9.175700331135645E-5,9.196330650419537E-5,1.0202826848730358E-4,0.622532188415118,9.160888727782727E-5,9.331872173028876E-5,9.464993380125664E-5,9.167568752277553E-5,9.142233547679735E-5,9.370275127530773E-5,9.207744970564045E-5,9.179177977662144E-5,9.186785884175572E-5,9.275673425763224E-5,9.216867515832889E-5,9.227362317757714E-5,9.23730376572232E-5,9.308195326488105E-5,9.259516085388103E-5,9.64876855112272E-5,9.16361217600564E-5,9.163857324091405E-5,9.187073904800233E-5,9.382343009929484E-5,9.207211460370357E-5,9.883161543978887E-5,9.233109987531571E-5,9.173586355760761E-5,9.215928504082984E-5,9.164394192986042E-5,9.169809675686659E-5,9.142187616359211E-5,9.144559521609045E-5,9.165142813726412E-5,9.261815650034442E-5,9.2147524726087E-5,9.17831991721495E-5,9.289846128265285E-5,9.181842606553873E-5,9.486909641117995E-5,9.347401869569825E-5,9.146832444564441E-5,9.167047503634122E-5,9.163868026189783E-5,9.42177371981338E-5,9.167183891824777E-5,9.143747693686741E-5,9.244113410336046E-5,9.169545115039204E-5,9.860838012149972E-5,9.161988218396953E-5,9.14672666669459E-5,9.190399601963831E-5,9.281560642039465E-5,9.189791604754303E-5,9.145034501812608E-5,9.166327314021216E-5,9.142298192736747E-5,9.3538320237545E-5,0.06471407272677934,9.201412603278675E-5,9.193365552094875E-5,9.226876830900667E-5,9.141964667199457E-5,9.193558286697087E-5,9.342671699013252E-5,9.158347575681851E-5,9.3850119063782E-5,9.18256131623148E-5,0.3056285294211018,9.197869648795853E-5,9.139098392024242E-5,9.150426932159752E-5]}}
{"value":"How this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me. This is a terrible cliché' ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done. It really surprises me that so many of these A list stars would agree to this unfunny film. What's even worse is the fact that is made almost 100 million here in the states. It does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks, even if the film is terrible. I felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore-fest. Billy Crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions. Whatever you do, don't fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this.","finished_norm":["how","thi","film","be","make","with","so","mani","big","star","be","beyond","me","thi","be","a","terribl","cliché","ride","film","with","the","wrong","act","ani","of","thi","actor","have","ever","do","it","realli","surpris","me","that","so","mani","of","thi","a","list","star","would","agre","to","thi","unfunni","film","what","even","wrong","be","the","fact","that","be","make","almost","million","here","in","the","state","it","doe","go","to","show","howev","that","big","star","can","pull","in","the","buck","even","if","the","film","be","terribl","i","feel","sorri","for","everyon","involv","in","thi","snorefest","billi","crystal","try","hi","well","with","the","what","he","be","give","and","the","rest","of","the","star","seem","to","be","walk","through","the","motion","whatev","you","do","do","not","fall","for","the","excel","cast","becaus","no","on","can","have","save","thi"],"filtered":["thi","film","make","mani","big","star","beyond","thi","terribl","cliché","ride","film","wrong","act","ani","thi","actor","ever","realli","surpris","mani","thi","list","star","agre","thi","unfunni","film","even","wrong","fact","make","almost","million","state","doe","go","show","howev","big","star","pull","buck","even","film","terribl","feel","sorri","everyon","involv","thi","snorefest","billi","crystal","try","hi","well","give","rest","star","seem","walk","motion","whatev","fall","excel","cast","becaus","save","thi"],"filtered2":["make","mani","big","star","beyond","terribl","cliché","ride","wrong","act","ani","actor","ever","realli","surpris","mani","list","star","agre","unfunni","even","wrong","fact","make","almost","million","state","doe","go","show","howev","big","star","pull","buck","even","terribl","feel","sorri","everyon","involv","snorefest","billi","crystal","try","well","give","rest","star","seem","walk","motion","whatev","fall","excel","cast","becaus","save"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,13,18,20,21,22,25,27,28,30,35,36,41,43,44,50,82,92,97,100,113,131,166,170,189,226,241,246,294,326,437,498,502,523,544,556,580,602,622,807,948,1002,1021,1284,1407,3290],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,13,18,20,21,22,25,27,28,30,35,36,41,43,44,50,82,92,97,100,113,131,166,170,189,226,241,246,294,326,437,498,502,523,544,556,580,602,622,807,948,1002,1021,1284,1407,3290],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,3.43598877114071,4.040393168790646,2.0489535369135887,2.0545557924622586,8.562184961271125,2.1521782565202803,2.2512118082053005,4.884774065938707,2.4071371113909277,2.498193474075453,2.5940874818617203,2.6627744961815836,2.673149229007135,2.886778509330039,2.942840385588056,3.1952392950510555,3.386191741044285,3.3132665011396125,3.4986697244709752,3.4222967456864013,3.4471119148061256,3.5039747767006686,3.555828138310924,3.4933926673701317,3.900174431363043,4.049068857301474,4.072271754381138,4.076977645418551,4.706176101378222,4.443131333311827,5.907203395474402]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.114695186338215E-5,9.05323266585495E-5,9.123612917129702E-5,9.070896584497423E-5,9.07104520092527E-5,9.05836569247557E-5,9.085306541239483E-5,9.054536272203239E-5,9.074894170513114E-5,1.0068099703230426E-4,0.9927865629591438,9.039920254355163E-5,9.208645883032699E-5,9.340009240025435E-5,9.046512069901098E-5,9.021511413742327E-5,9.246541730973294E-5,9.086157765883626E-5,9.057967996810597E-5,9.065475441800667E-5,9.153189233708336E-5,9.095159848999972E-5,9.105516068282272E-5,9.115326240579235E-5,9.185281686505123E-5,9.137245249139394E-5,9.521357681198562E-5,9.042607739760082E-5,9.0428496506938E-5,9.065759659146377E-5,9.258450258384227E-5,9.085631300630184E-5,9.752655541762385E-5,9.111187840743219E-5,9.052450211628062E-5,9.094233236791345E-5,9.043379430296934E-5,9.048723402176425E-5,9.021466088939565E-5,9.023806673455602E-5,9.044118165587231E-5,9.139514448301217E-5,9.093072734676314E-5,9.057121266952114E-5,9.16717478731721E-5,9.060597439586779E-5,9.361636099332596E-5,9.223970511731523E-5,9.026049582726921E-5,9.045997704285562E-5,9.042860211472209E-5,9.297360290316173E-5,9.046132291485976E-5,9.02300556562688E-5,9.122045964625428E-5,9.048462335021644E-5,9.730626789582815E-5,9.041005226323317E-5,9.025945201641577E-5,9.069041440864549E-5,9.158998709976283E-5,9.068441472187674E-5,9.02427538160065E-5,9.045287024692986E-5,9.021575205168856E-5,9.230315756475778E-5,9.099291840648155E-5,9.079909016774009E-5,9.07196822596802E-5,9.10503699222288E-5,9.021246083797613E-5,9.072158415532158E-5,9.219

{"value":"Movie about a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists. New family moves in, cue the overwritten dialog, mediocre acting, green jello salad with shredded carrots, and every other 'inside Mormon joke' known to man. Anyone outside the Mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie. Anyone inside the Mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there. You'll be much better off watching Hess's other movies (Napoleon Dynamite, etc..) than trying to sit through this one. The acting is mediocre. Jared Hess has had his hands on much more quality films like \"Saints and Soldiers\", and \"Napoleon Dynamite\". I would recommend both movies over this groaner.","finished_norm":["movi","about","a","small","town","with","equal","number","of","mormon","and","baptist","new","famili","move","in","cue","the","overwrit","dialog","mediocr","act","green","jello","salad","with","shred","carrot","and","everi","other","insid","mormon","joke","know","to","man","anyon","outsid","the","mormon","cultur","will","have","a","hard","time","stomach","thi","movi","anyon","insid","the","mormon","cultur","will","be","slightli","amus","with","a","chuckl","here","and","there","you","will","be","much","well","off","watch","hess","other","movi","napoleon","dynamit","etc","than","try","to","sit","through","thi","on","the","act","be","mediocr","jare","hess","have","have","hi","hand","on","much","much","qualiti","film","like","saint","and","soldier","and","napoleon","dynamit","i","would","recommend","both","movi","over","thi","groaner"],"filtered":["movi","small","town","equal","number","mormon","baptist","new","famili","move","cue","overwrit","dialog","mediocr","act","green","jello","salad","shred","carrot","everi","insid","mormon","joke","know","man","anyon","outsid","mormon","cultur","hard","time","stomach","thi","movi","anyon","insid","mormon","cultur","slightli","amus","chuckl","much","well","watch","hess","movi","napoleon","dynamit","etc","try","sit","thi","act","mediocr","jare","hess","hi","hand","much","much","qualiti","film","like","saint","soldier","napoleon","dynamit","recommend","movi","thi","groaner"],"filtered2":["small","town","equal","number","mormon","baptist","new","famili","move","cue","overwrit","dialog","mediocr","act","green","jello","salad","shred","carrot","everi","insid","mormon","joke","know","man","anyon","outsid","mormon","cultur","hard","time","stomach","anyon","insid","mormon","cultur","slightli","amus","chuckl","well","watch","hess","napoleon","dynamit","etc","try","sit","act","mediocr","jare","hess","hand","qualiti","like","saint","soldier","napoleon","dynamit","recommend","groaner"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,8,20,21,26,36,45,85,87,158,171,182,214,235,244,275,298,319,363,429,432,450,657,708,787,791,880,891,906,965,1172,1383,1824,2050,2558,2979,2989,3381,4394,4783,5073,5923,7819],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,8,20,21,26,36,45,85,87,158,171,182,214,235,244,275,298,319,363,429,432,450,657,708,787,791,880,891,906,965,1172,1383,1824,2050,2558,2979,2989,3381,4394,4783,5073,5923,7819],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.165345040023057,2.324031090670098,1.3324924169710188,1.4680183469605717,1.8162961064622165,2.011190219103739,2.115024371522662,4.621394522982961,2.373087554090762,2.7365296724240786,2.7303758068497004,2.6457189377809835,2.634508058031767,2.7832848715031413,2.7819920465008363,2.9056060024680126,3.0349689855553557,3.2872346624216657,3.235085203598255,3.469984576472117,4.00861390260916,3.6683728173057184,7.520481305838142,3.8240921249056035,8.22110788190431,7.832222047251711,3.9081109809587793,3.9868265484242533,4.327618446189983,4.520909034354511,4.798834931860927,4.944927550358424,5.214056214914456,5.408212229355414,24.701869528276326,5.7959777603641776,6.489124940924123,12.685042933464494,12.875663293073144,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.07386221447378E-5,6.0329047416085135E-5,6.07980482330336E-5,6.044675646263983E-5,6.044774681468902E-5,6.036325294441E-5,6.054278171634111E-5,6.0337734404711254E-5,6.0473395627366054E-5,0.1513338917666985,0.22291319179902583,6.0240335998381034E-5,6.136469199678446E-5,0.4255680301387613,6.028426262296991E-5,6.011766293129024E-5,6.161722283208527E-5,6.054845411799185E-5,6.036060277496059E-5,6.0410630982728604E-5,6.0995139269033956E-5,6.060844231438692E-5,6.067745422065214E-5,6.0742827372045417E-5,6.120899736568688E-5,6.0888891541115846E-5,6.344854486961196E-5,6.0258244897931895E-5,6.0259856947100344E-5,6.041252495390538E-5,6.169657902907549E-5,6.054494585211489E-5,6.498987050568255E-5,6.0715249850385624E-5,6.0323833287618864E-5,6.060226754412155E-5,6.026338729918309E-5,6.029899852721703E-5,6.011736089529096E-5,6.013295811226981E-5,6.026831009284158E-5,6.090401305945995E-5,6.059453417531195E-5,6.0354960325719924E-5,6.10883363797182E-5,6.037812488930109E-5,6.23841901533009E-5,6.146681245314831E-5,6.014790443970595E-5,6.02808349868145E-5,6.025992732215033E-5,6.195586819660536E-5,6.028173185071881E-5,6.012761967969349E-5,6.078760635493125E-5,6.0297258824578105E-5,6.484307502568005E-5,6.024756604843362E-5,6.014720886369686E-5,6.043439413281555E-5,6.10338525311545E-5,6.043039605388714E-5,6.013608149559052E-5,6.027609915107266E-5,6.0118088025412733E-5,6.150909597608114E-5,6.063597713308281E-5,6.0506813623901034E-5,6.045389768075262E-5,6.067426174749148E-5,6.011589482221735E-5,6.045516506839816E-5,6.143570771297245

{"value":"The novelty of hearing clean-cut Jay Leno spout four-letter words is the only memorable aspect of this formulaic mismatched-police-partners caper. In COLLISION COURSE, the pelican-faced comedian teams up with the late Pat Morita to track down a stolen prototype turbocharger (think car lover Leno played a hand in the plot?). The two leads try hard, they really do, but Leno is no actor and Morita's fish-out-of-water routine gets old in a hurry. The film carries a bit of cheesy '80s appeal, but its worthy moments become increasingly scarce as it fills out its overlong 100-minute running time. Fans of Leno's considerable comedic talents will feel let down; everyone else will just be bored.","finished_norm":["the","novelti","of","hear","cleancut","jai","leno","spout","fourlett","word","be","the","onli","memor","aspect","of","thi","formula","mismatchedpolicepartn","caper","in","collis","cours","the","pelicanfac","comedian","team","up","with","the","late","pat","morita","to","track","down","a","steal","prototyp","turbocharg","think","car","lover","leno","plai","a","hand","in","the","plot","the","two","lead","try","hard","thei","realli","do","but","leno","be","no","actor","and","morita","fishoutofwat","routin","get","old","in","a","hurri","the","film","carri","a","bite","of","cheesi","appeal","but","it","worthi","moment","becom","increasingli","scarc","a","it","fill","out","it","overlong","minut","run","time","fan","of","leno","consider","comed","talent","will","feel","let","down","everyon","els","will","just","be","bore"],"filtered":["novelti","hear","cleancut","jai","leno","spout","fourlett","word","onli","memor","aspect","thi","formula","mismatchedpolicepartn","caper","collis","cours","pelicanfac","comedian","team","late","pat","morita","track","steal","prototyp","turbocharg","think","car","lover","leno","plai","hand","plot","two","lead","try","hard","thei","realli","leno","actor","morita","fishoutofwat","routin","get","old","hurri","film","carri","bite","cheesi","appeal","worthi","moment","becom","increasingli","scarc","fill","overlong","minut","run","time","fan","leno","consider","comed","talent","feel","let","everyon","els","bore"],"filtered2":["novelti","hear","cleancut","jai","leno","spout","fourlett","word","onli","memor","aspect","formula","mismatchedpolicepartn","caper","collis","cours","pelicanfac","comedian","team","late","pat","morita","track","steal","prototyp","turbocharg","think","car","lover","leno","plai","hand","plot","two","lead","try","hard","realli","leno","actor","morita","fishoutofwat","routin","get","old","hurri","carri","bite","cheesi","appeal","worthi","moment","becom","increasingli","scarc","fill","overlong","minut","run","time","fan","leno","consider","comed","talent","feel","let","everyon","els","bore"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,8,11,12,13,32,36,40,41,43,47,59,67,108,115,124,137,140,150,154,157,171,188,196,199,216,235,246,258,276,284,543,553,578,621,645,689,723,867,954,1074,1176,1337,1573,1634,1683,1981,2176,2182,2929,3195,3751,4427,4913,5560,5710,5889,6753],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,8,11,12,13,32,36,40,41,43,47,59,67,108,115,124,137,140,150,154,157,171,188,196,199,216,235,246,258,276,284,543,553,578,621,645,689,723,867,954,1074,1176,1337,1573,1634,1683,1981,2176,2182,2929,3195,3751,4427,4913,5560,5710,5889,6753],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.7064694353107215,1.8693254449200722,1.9570915389266579,2.138507503627933,2.201553588425805,2.2323930368088845,2.2939035841256437,2.317169775997098,2.332712011146513,2.348499626138016,2.3360150694757706,2.373087554090762,2.5378812223426954,2.478925055209576,2.558331832813986,2.6070186965339692,2.6457189377809835,2.673149229007135,2.7061321952397077,2.7884729505849193,3.110998680163279,3.477726550625732,3.454678155189441,3.575630765607104,3.5446859617576822,3.558633189238533,3.634471265630037,3.865219416329466,3.8844878351953436,4.062925891962901,4.110553940952155,4.358390104856736,4.396611317676934,4.605250182788262,4.828393734102471,4.706176101378222,4.838444069955973,5.259176650194926,5.426230734858092,5.373120909544144,5.501738287366237,5.719991853386255,5.967828017290836,6.101359409915359,6.2980697041614135,6.543192162194399,27.474458250516104,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.743500495179707E-5,5.7047707286199055E-5,5.749119881255673E-5,5.7159014053343524E-5,5.715995053943492E-5,5.708005235132147E-5,5.7249816424669766E-5,5.705592178328738E-5,5.718420429480663E-5,6.344275310237113E-5,0.5385635120673528,5.696382094608791E-5,5.8027022415854504E-5,5.885479064124413E-5,0.41895535342510165,5.684782015504227E-5,5.826581791802149E-5,5.7255180300329015E-5,5.707754632648793E-5,5.712485346417766E-5,5.767756992584376E-5,5.7311905695725544E-5,5.737716399494462E-5,5.743898145377732E-5,5.7879796127336655E-5,5.7577101088000324E-5,5.9997533037324595E-5,5.698075576775597E-5,5.698228013641471E-5,5.712664442090463E-5,5.834085787457875E-5,5.7251862851547656E-5,6.14550248673021E-5,5.741290389328683E-5,5.704277675791729E-5,5.730606677564068E-5,5.698561847011729E-5,5.701929277793407E-5,5.6847534546997466E-5,5.6862283420165516E-5,5.6990273509500274E-5,5.759140013612332E-5,5.7298754030303534E-5,5.70722107741057E-5,5.776569797887874E-5,5.709411540047044E-5,5.89910693

{"value":"I picked this movie on the cover alone thinking that i was in for an adventure to the level of \"Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom\". Unfortunately I was in for a virtual yawn. Not like any yawn i have had before though. This yawn was so large that i could barely find anything of quality in this movie. The cover described amazing special effects. There were none. The movie was so lightweight that even the stereotypes were awfully portrayed. It does give the idea that you can solve problems with violence. Good if you want to teach your kids that. I don't. Keep away from this one.

{"value":"This film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes. The problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time. The film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. Eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad English dubbing, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. For a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then I probably didn't see an uncut version.","finished_norm":["thi","film","seem","wai","too","long","even","at","onli","minut","the","problem","with","jungl","horror","film","be","that","there","be","alwai","wai","too","much","footag","of","peopl","walk","through","the","jungl","up","a","rocki","cliff","near","a","river","or","lake","to","pad","out","the","run","time","the","film","be","worth","see","for","the","laughabl","and","nake","nativ","zombi","with","big","bulg","bloodi","ey","which","be","alwai","accompani","on","the","soundtrack","with","heavi","breath","and","lot","of","reverb","eurotrash","fan","will","be","plenti","entertain","by","the","bad","english","dub","gratuit","femal","flesh","and","veri","silli","makeup","job","on","the","monster","and","nativ","extra","for","a","zombiecannib","flick","thi","be","pretti","light","on","the","gore","but","then","i","probabl","do","not","see","a","uncut","version"],"filtered":["thi","film","seem","wai","long","even","onli","minut","problem","jungl","horror","film","alwai","wai","much","footag","peopl","walk","jungl","rocki","cliff","near","river","lake","pad","run","time","film","worth","see","laughabl","nake","nativ","zombi","big","bulg","bloodi","ey","alwai","accompani","soundtrack","heavi","breath","lot","reverb","eurotrash","fan","plenti","entertain","bad","english","dub","gratuit","femal","flesh","veri","silli","makeup","job","monster","nativ","extra","zombiecannib","flick","thi","pretti","light","gore","probabl","see","uncut","version"],"filtered2":["seem","wai","long","even","onli","minut","problem","jungl","horror","alwai","wai","footag","peopl","walk","jungl","rocki","cliff","near","river","lake","pad","run","time","worth","see","laughabl","nake","nativ","zombi","big","bulg","bloodi","ey","alwai","accompani","soundtrack","heavi","breath","lot","reverb","eurotrash","fan","plenti","entertain","bad","english","dub","gratuit","femal","flesh","veri","silli","makeup","job","monster","nativ","extra","zombiecannib","flick","pretti","light","gore","probabl","see","uncut","version"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,8,9,11,15,23,33,35,59,72,78,82,83,99,137,140,148,167,195,197,219,220,257,268,281,289,294,353,358,385,413,422,552,555,588,658,796,887,893,949,960,1001,1177,1179,1320,1344,1364,1437,1665,1806,1936,1975,2316,2874,3971,4845,8087],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,8,9,11,15,23,33,35,59,72,78,82,83,99,137,140,148,167,195,197,219,220,257,268,281,289,294,353,358,385,413,422,552,555,588,658,796,887,893,949,960,1001,1177,1179,1320,1344,1364,1437,1665,1806,1936,1975,2316,2874,3971,4845,8087],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.364847727375781,2.803707089537043,1.463169012899134,1.8693254449200722,1.9209463754160525,2.0064197866819473,2.020196584395323,2.292318797740072,2.056430207256609,2.2939035841256437,2.317169775997098,2.3018654096236517,2.4609576687888097,2.51289241584188,5.116663665627972,2.5792094178355414,2.8336934208777267,2.7602659523229094,3.6746621462132825,2.832333801361687,2.8282659991423613,2.886778509330039,3.0266839340212486,3.2030824725120812,3.09496984188738,3.467417180966871,3.2090054908152035,3.424750734647968,3.432149042129413,3.6375061693251913,3.813163054373413,3.850067611308864,3.9323057095458362,4.017463517886143,4.086456389373095,4.058285512406398,4.035401218572811,4.263079925052412,4.274508620876034,4.370968887063596,4.477736862489302,9.448067437556459,4.828393734102471,4.77960356993304,4.724033718778229,10.398914830986607,4.8796870284900224,5.039114765418124,5.373120909544144,5.878215858601149,6.214688095222362,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.02958601602351459,6.050349191408483E-5,6.097384887066384E-5,0.10597374125991439,6.06225345380153E-5,6.0537796349428335E-5,6.071784423790176E-5,6.05122040215788E-5,6.064825751553404E-5,0.578623616953925,0.2811846487085342,6.041452398282066E-5,6.154213111357433E-5,6.242004313693295E-5,6.045857762347068E-5,6.0291496200339466E-5,6.179539215458334E-5,6.0723533041589344E-5,6.053513851687966E-5,6.05853113837458E-5,6.11715098053831E-5,6.0783694696894415E-5,6.085290615458403E-5,6.091846833575759E-5,6.138598628356054E-5,6.106495485677523E-5,6.363200955259052E-5,6.043248466686217E-5,6.043410137735249E-5,6.0587210831436213E-5,6.187497781403883E-5,6.072001463138381E-5,6.517779200985015E-5,6.089081107229632E-5,6.049826270870185E-5,6.0777502071967894E-5,6.04376419376272E-5,6.0473356137331724E-5,6.0291193290987785E-5,6.030683560810998E-5,6.044257896579303E-5,6.108012009975596E-5,6.076974634173046E-5,6.052947975221106E-5,6.1264976400236E-5,6.0552711297301765E-5,6.256457720067717E-5,6.16445468564131E-5,6.0321825153609355E-5,6.045514007613162E-5,6.04341

{"value":"A real blow-up of the film literally. This British film is boringly made.<br /><br />What an exciting plot! A terrorist places bombs on a train. How could the writers and producers of this stinker turn this into such a dull story?<br /><br />Glenn Ford, as the expert called upon to defuse the bomb, is given awful writing material to work with. Naturally, just as he is called in, his wife, Anne Vernon, is about to leave him. No wonder we never heard of Miss Vernon. After such a film, it would be enough to end her career.<br /><br />That elderly man who loved trains and interferes is our 1953 version of senile dementia. I thought it was highly insulting to show this man, even at the

{"value":"Visually speaking, this film is stunning. It has some delightful black comedic moments. But on the whole, the plot is very clichéd, as is its seeming message. If you're a fan of over-the-top violence in mainstream movies like hostel or saw, you'll love it. If you're looking for something at all high-brow, steer away. I saw it as part of the edinburgh film festival 06, and I only chose it because I was looking for something disturbing. Ultimately, it isn't disturbing. Just grinding and unpleasant to sit through.

{"value":"I only watched this because it was directed by Lucio Fulci and featured Claudio Cassinelli, an actor I like. I was certainly disappointed.<br /><br />The idea that condemned prisoners would fight to the death for TV ratings has been overdone with Rollerball, Logan's Run, Blade Runner, and the new film, Death Race, which will certainly suck me in because it stars Jason Statham.<br /><br />This was just a bore for the most part. The \"Kill Bike\" action was ridiculous. The \"training\" was a snooze-fest. It just never grabbed me and made me want to care about anyone, including \"Dallas\" star Jared Martin or Fred Williamson.<br /><br />Pick one of the others mentioned and you'll be better

{"value":"This film differentiates itself from the run-of-the-mill \"wonder of the human body\" documentaries by bravely, if bizarrely, opting to elicit disgust in the viewer. In one scene, the camera closes in on a gigantic 50-foot zit as a teenager squeezes pus and fluid out of it. In another, the camera is semisubmerged in a swamp of half digested food and stomach acid as parts of a pasta salad drop in from the esophagus and plop into the goo. In a final tour de force, the camera takes the viewer on a harrowing ride through a forest of...teenage armpit hair. Unfortunately, I'm not making any of this up. See this film if you must, but: bring your vomit bag, and don't have pasta salad beforehand.","finished_norm":["thi","film","differenti","itself","from","the","runofthemil","wonder","of","the","human","bodi","documentari","by","brave","if","bizarr","opt","to","elicit","disgust","in","the","viewer","in","on","scene","the","camera","close","in","on","a","gigant","foot","zit","a","a","teenag","squeez","pu","and","fluid","out","of","it","in","anoth","the","camera","be","semisubmerg","in","a","swamp","of","half","digest","food","and","stomach","acid","a","part","of","a","pasta","salad","drop","in","from","the","esophagu","and","plop","into","the","goo","in","a","final","tour","de","forc","the","camera","take","the","viewer","on","a","harrow","ride","through","a","forest","ofteenag","armpit","hair","unfortun","i","be","not","make","ani","of","thi","up","see","thi","film","if","you","must","but","bring","your","vomit","bag","and","do","not","have","pasta","salad","beforehand"],"filtered":["thi","film","differenti","runofthemil","wonder","human","bodi","documentari","brave","bizarr","opt","elicit","disgust","viewer","scene","camera","close","gigant","foot","zit","teenag","squeez","pu","fluid","anoth","camera","semisubmerg","swamp","half","digest","food","stomach","acid","part","pasta","salad","drop","esophagu","plop","goo","final","tour","de","forc","camera","take","viewer","harrow","ride","forest","ofteenag","armpit","hair","unfortun","make","ani","thi","see","thi","film","must","bring","vomit","bag","pasta","salad","beforehand"],"filtered2":["differenti","runofthemil","wonder","human","bodi","documentari","brave","bizarr","opt","elicit","disgust","viewer","scene","camera","close","gigant","foot","zit","teenag","squeez","pu","fluid","anoth","camera","semisubmerg","swamp","half","digest","food","stomach","acid","part","pasta","salad","drop","esophagu","plop","goo","final","tour","de","forc","camera","take","viewer","harrow","ride","forest","ofteenag","armpit","hair","unfortun","make","ani","see","must","bring","vomit","bag","pasta","salad","beforehand"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,19,27,31,61,73,141,156,175,206,227,231,250,279,292,295,338,376,624,692,750,813,825,904,963,981,1002,1390,1637,1824,1897,2349,2641,2937,2999,3995,4512,4573,4726,4890,4970,5374,6026,6473,7142,7144,7819,8053],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,19,27,31,61,73,141,156,175,206,227,231,250,279,292,295,338,376,624,692,750,813,825,904,963,981,1002,1390,1637,1824,1897,2349,2641,2937,2999,3995,4512,4573,4726,4890,4970,5374,6026,6473,7142,7144,7819,8053],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.312380678011735,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,1.8818517047392527,1.8950689206770979,2.2657547357741192,2.3451551414151686,2.3791142619576227,2.597304642813496,2.6005321873043625,8.114805921017584,2.6812935439488212,5.5821542374466135,2.9752256367457734,2.7910771187233068,2.9720957437368454,3.1569204307489187,3.9241755834625858,3.753391311073496,4.030886538218284,3.8204358137024927,3.850067611308864,3.9121030022283168,4.035401218572811,4.039936373738201,4.072271754381138,4.456830177669989,4.8796870284900224,4.798834931860927,4.85885294158718,5.102830579804232,5.322690055917252,5.444579873526289,5.604922523601468,5.7959777603641776,6.032366538428407,5.999576715605417,6.032366538428407,6.101359409915359,6.137727054086234,6.255510089742618,6.600350576034347,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353,13.897314540605125,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.719801957866032E-5,5.681231996083603E-5,5.7253981575192386E-5,5.692316745970383E-5,5.6924100081714325E-5,0.058459486416591794,5.701359516694031E-5,5.682050056368757E-5,0.04722260170667144,0.2710453542888869,7.358326052649521E-5,5.672877974824117E-5,0.10910605166917133,5.861194702117817E-5,5.6770145782644644E-5,5.6613257593712984E-5,5.8025404487013546E-5,5.701893691045079E-5,5.68420358808065E-5,5.6889147822209806E-5,5.743958369354573E-5,0.05161887561830032,0.04975492129159097,5.720197967300195E-5,5.764097547965276E-5,5.733952940507066E-5,5.974997429216443E-5,5.67456446943162E-5,5.674716277320312E-5,5.6890931389182934E-5,5.810013481754883E-5,5.701563314995653E-5,6.120145229406861E-5,0.07099884620046903,5.680740977664731E-5,5.706961342059662E-5,5.6750487332444314E-5,5.678402269505842E-5,5.661297316412946E-5,5.662766118125312E-5,5.6755123164442425E-5,5.735376945319431E-5,5.706233084873441E-5,5.6836722343706994E-5,5.752734811712599E-5,5.685853658832533E-5,5.874766341067741E-5,5.788376189626183E-5,5.6641736250774514E-5,5.676691795176863E-5,5.674722904591963E-5,0.048782697428158134,5.676776253528644E-5,5.662263393894439E-5,5.724414837965639E-5,5.678238440393346E-5,0.2514571944266803,5.673558834102546E-5,5.664108122158911E-5,5.6911525760265176E-5,5.7476040265106546E-5,5.690776073911802E-5,5.6630602494934936E-5

{"value":"absolutely trash. i liked Halloween and from then on johnny's been in a downward spiral. this is about the pits. we get it john. pro-lifers are scary! you don't have to make a shitty film that bores the hell out of me to 'tell' me.<br /><br />The pacing is way off here. It feels like john didn't have much to work with here. to his credit it looks like he did not write this junk. There are countless times where the camera just sits and waits for the actors to look dumb or say something dumb. i love the long cut. too bad carpenter doesn't know how to employ it. he needs to bunk up with Herzog and Fassbinder 30 years ago.

{"value":"I watched this knowing almost nothing about it, other than the brief description I read here. After watching it I was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish, then I looked at the other stuff he's done to see if this was his first or second movie, but no, he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com. He sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this one.<br /><br />The story was pretty awful too, could someone just fall in love with a girl because she's pretty but has the mind of a child? I gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that I rather enjoyed near the end but as a whole this movie is pretty terrible.","finished_norm":["i","watch","thi","know","almost","noth","about","it","other","than","the","brief","descript","i","read","here","after","watch","it","i","be","origin","go","to","sai","that","the","director","show","promis","but","seem","kind","of","amateurish","then","i","look","at","the","other","stuff","he","do","to","see","if","thi","be","hi","or","movi","but","no","he","do","hous","on","haunt","hill","and","fear","dot","com","he","sort","of","miss","the","mark","on","both","that","movi","and","it","be","the","same","with","thi","onebr","br","the","stori","be","pretti","aw","too","can","someon","just","fall","in","love","with","a","girl","becaus","she","pretti","but","have","the","mind","of","a","child","i","give","it","a","becaus","there","be","some","visual","that","i","rather","enjoi","near","the","end","but","a","a","whole","thi","movi","be","pretti","terribl"],"filtered":["watch","thi","know","almost","noth","brief","descript","read","watch","origin","go","sai","director","show","promis","seem","kind","amateurish","look","stuff","see","thi","hi","movi","hous","haunt","hill","fear","dot","com","sort","miss","mark","movi","thi","onebr","br","stori","pretti","aw","someon","fall","love","girl","becaus","pretti","mind","child","give","becaus","visual","rather","enjoi","near","end","whole","thi","movi","pretti","terribl"],"filtered2":["watch","know","almost","noth","brief","descript","read","watch","origin","go","director","show","promis","seem","kind","amateurish","look","stuff","see","hous","haunt","hill","fear","dot","com","sort","miss","mark","onebr","stori","pretti","aw","someon","fall","love","girl","becaus","pretti","mind","child","give","becaus","visual","rather","enjoi","near","end","whole","pretti","terribl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,7,16,17,22,24,26,28,30,35,49,54,58,69,78,84,111,122,131,138,139,145,160,166,170,180,200,213,238,255,269,361,555,635,683,717,812,1018,1186,1188,1262,1587,2068,6840],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,7,16,17,22,24,26,28,30,35,49,54,58,69,78,84,111,122,131,138,139,145,160,166,170,180,200,213,238,255,269,361,555,635,683,717,812,1018,1186,1188,1262,1587,2068,6840],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,2.5958480334723544,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.6920303308087352,1.8113893252729412,1.865701314626681,2.127032521151058,6.019259360045842,2.2212694515902225,2.1183455303375887,2.2489347673732487,2.2512118082053005,2.2907365189289424,2.2939035841256437,2.34599021453259,2.3722295531801256,2.4423870329693536,2.4071371113909277,2.7097314792693545,2.5308211829319704,2.8432628718938773,2.597304642813496,2.6754694156628323,2.76533567167316,3.0399731661399314,3.432149042129413,3.587125145032839,3.6105180246075443,3.7398317812878634,3.952924996748572,4.268777946167049,4.2574141875167335,4.213208095012239,4.528289141652134,4.573751515728891,4.944927550358424,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.958342368856844E-5,9.891190938193244E-5,9.968085516001032E-5,9.910489811696007E-5,9.910652183913605E-5,9.896799072687223E-5,9.926233539799272E-5,9.892615205057368E-5,9.914857410324305E-5,1.099999306601433E-4,0.5197237052302971,9.876646343035671E-5,1.0060989049228409E-4,1.0204511268777429E-4,9.883848290516828E-5,9.856533598320837E-5,1.0102392499419067E-4,9.927163552955598E-5,9.896364566704361E-5,9.9045668933865E-5,1.0000399387225295E-4,9.936998859992507E-5,9.948313640701212E-5,9.959031832855027E-5,1.0035462285750503E-4,9.982979643194876E-5,1.0402645142520937E-4,9.879582579434842E-5,9.879846881405615E-5,9.904877417608967E-5,1.0115403268363346E-4,9.926588358598364E-5,1.0655351704571535E-4,9.954510386818297E-5,9.890336060776061E-5,9.9359864814732E-5,9.880425696885472E-5,0.47249405176513526,9.856484078299104E-5,9.859041305005805E-5,9.881232808784482E-5,9.985458877189495E-5,9.934718564428802E-5,9.895439464366618E-5,1.0015679429860612E-4,9.899237388106419E-5,1.0228139888818021E-4,1.0077732110421199E-4,9.861491815743626E-5,9.883286315728033E-5,9.879858419679241E-5,1.0157914774413736E-4,9.883433360186764E-5,9.858166047427829E-5,9.966373527920875E-5,9.885979070250366E-5,1.0631283992851271E-4,9.877831738937408E-5,9.861377773248135E-5,9.908462957801074E-5,1.0006746582877726E-4,9.907807456616145E-5,9.859553396313749E-5,9.882509856334412E-5,9.85660329421879E-5,1.0084664664750849E-4,9.941513304705868E-5,9.920336425801205E-5,9.911660643242505E-5,9.947790221835016E-5,9.856243709698546E-5,9.91186843656482E-5,1.0072632362665523E-4,9.87390664590038E-5,1.0118280690754714E-4,9.900012251934587E-5,9.977494711993197E-5,9.916516653563368E-5,9.853153487006336E-5,9.865367147473795E-5]}}
{"value":"I saw the omen when i was 11 on tv. I enjoyed the Trilogy. So when the chance to finally see one at the cinema came around i didnt pass it up. I went in to the cinema knowing that what i was about to see wasnt a cinema release but a made for TV film. However being a fan i couldnt resist. But this Omen movie which i saw at a midnight screening didnt bring chills it brought laughter. Risible Dialogue such as \"it is written that if a baby cries during baptism they reject there god\".

{"value":"The beginning of this movie was good. It started to get really dumb after he told the people he wanted to kill himself. I think if I came from a little town like that I would be offended after seeing this movie. They made a lot of these people look dumb and crazy. How could these people have so little to do that they follow him around all day. A lot of times these people were telling him ways to kill himself like they were urging him to do it. How can so many people have little respect for other people? I also think they could have made a much better ending for this movie. There were some good parts to this movie also. Some people might like it, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.","finished_norm":["the","begin","of","thi","movi","be","good","it","start","to","get","realli","dumb","after","he","tell","the","peopl","he","want","to","kill","himself","i","think","if","i","come","from","a","littl","town","like","that","i","would","be","offend","after","see","thi","movi","thei","make","a","lot","of","thi","peopl","look","dumb","and","crazi","how","can","thi","peopl","have","so","littl","to","do","that","thei","follow","him","around","all","dai","a","lot","of","time","thi","peopl","be","tell","him","wai","to","kill","himself","like","thei","be","urg","him","to","do","it","how","can","so","mani","peopl","have","littl","respect","for","other","peopl","i","conjur","think","thei","can","have","make","a","much","well","end","for","thi","movi","there","be","some","good","part","to","thi","movi","conjur","some","peopl","mai","like","it","but","i","would","not","recommend","thi","to","anyon"],"filtered":["begin","thi","movi","good","start","get","realli","dumb","tell","peopl","want","kill","think","come","littl","town","like","offend","see","thi","movi","thei","make","lot","thi","peopl","look","dumb","crazi","thi","peopl","littl","thei","follow","around","dai","lot","time","thi","peopl","tell","wai","kill","like","thei","urg","mani","peopl","littl","respect","peopl","conjur","think","thei","make","much","well","end","thi","movi","good","part","thi","movi","conjur","peopl","mai","like","recommend","thi","anyon"],"filtered2":["begin","good","start","get","realli","dumb","tell","peopl","want","kill","think","come","littl","town","like","offend","see","make","lot","peopl","look","dumb","crazi","peopl","littl","follow","around","dai","lot","time","peopl","tell","wai","kill","like","urg","mani","peopl","littl","respect","peopl","conjur","think","make","well","end","good","part","conjur","peopl","mai","like","recommend","anyon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,8,12,13,14,16,20,23,24,33,34,37,39,46,50,61,71,72,76,90,98,132,147,158,260,298,420,450,695,712,1629,2596],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,8,12,13,14,16,20,23,24,33,34,37,39,46,50,61,71,72,76,90,98,132,147,158,260,298,420,450,695,712,1629,2596],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,3.3525245991777624,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,9.553934091630467,1.3210361566119257,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,3.1077880109725475,1.655771293751733,1.717994385570355,1.8818517047392527,1.9214926742550966,3.841892750832105,4.267533106664805,4.095425683930709,2.0881990796736947,2.253494045787767,2.2844323215331563,2.3106972614914807,2.6754694156628323,2.7819920465008363,6.604674861214845,3.469984576472117,3.6284289511740746,3.7165362186843414,4.679973728984199,5.185068678041204]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.2843300948738108E-4,1.275669556792211E-4,1.285586671182655E-4,1.278158537700748E-4,1.2781794788893424E-4,1.2763928394069203E-4,1.2801890105505035E-4,1.2758532448729147E-4,1.2787218280710608E-4,1.4186720655706085E-4,0.9898357168400581,1.2737937364411204E-4,1.2975684648612072E-4,1.3160785641349936E-4,1.2747225735456447E-4,1.2711997903433684E-4,1.3029082789730188E-4,1.28030895459752E-4,1.276336801053395E-4,1.2773946573326492E-4,1.2897541998493724E-4,1.2815774167925268E-4,1.2830366871050772E-4,1.2844190152311755E-4,1.294276271306793E-4,1.2875075707745142E-4,1.341631943144991E-4,1.2741724236395958E-4,1.274206510735884E-4,1.2774347057251754E-4,1.3045862813446628E-4,1.2802347716264962E-4,1.3742235764502173E-4,1.2838358831192005E-4,1.2755593030216889E-4,1.2814468500624838E-4,1.2742811607240672E-4,1.275034167135217E-4,1.2711934037328408E-4,1.2715232099492954E-4,1.274385254162858E-4,1.2878273182499056E-4,1.2812833264601002E-4,1.276217490355972E-4,1.2917248710595596E-4,1.276707309602629E-4,1.3191259536195506E-4,1.2997278219684165E-4,1.2718392529785286E-4,1.2746500955059195E-4,1.2742079988301382E-4,1.3100690017188563E-4,1.2746690598693284E-4,1.271410327743952E-4,1.2853658756193E-4,1.2749973807812235E-4,1.3711195571935834E-4,1.2739466172695307E-4,1.271824544887199E-4,1.2778971338085385E-4,1.2905727993805515E-4,1.2778125936443378E-4,1.2715892545030728E-4,1.2745499553289965E-4,1.2712087790420809E-4,1.3006219153657034E-4,1.2821596459419428E-4,1.2794284581713942E-4,1.2783095401603439E-4,1.282969181633064E-4,1.2711624033297494E-4,1.2783363393210353E-4,1.2990701061281414E-4,1.2734403969643924E-4,1.304957383284726E-4,1.276807243999046E-4,1.286800177721564E-4,1.278935821118067E-4,1.2707638564776264E-4,1.2723390555545317E-4]}}
{"value":"Denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie.<br /><br />Maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie. Someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie, giving away most of the story line in about the first 5 minutes. That and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before.<br /><br />So first it confuses you and then it puts you off. The dramatization pushes beyond suspension of disbelieve.<br /><br />Of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers. Granted, it does that so if you are looking for that ... knock yourself

{"value":"OH MY GOD.. THE WORST SH*T I'VE EVER SEEN -this is the main thought which came into my mind right after watching the movie. And I really do not understand anybody with opposite myth. Though, maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable. I especially mean the role of H. Graham. What was that??? In my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers. The character was played in affected and annoying way. Every time she appears it reminds that you' re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment, then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion. TERRIBLE, don't waste your time.","finished_norm":["oh","my","god","the","wrong","sht","i","have","ever","see","thi","be","the","main","think","which","come","into","my","mind","right","after","watch","the","movi","and","i","realli","do","not","understand","anybodi","with","opposit","myth","though","mayb","the","idea","be","good","but","the","effect","miser","i","especi","mean","the","role","of","h","graham","what","be","that","in","my","opinion","it","have","destroi","all","posit","intent","of","produc","the","charact","be","plai","in","affect","and","annoi","wai","everi","time","she","appear","it","remind","that","you","re","watch","a","movi","and","be","destroi","a","spirit","of","the","moment","then","whole","movi","becaus","the","much","time","what","you","can","see","there","be","her","stupid","face","with","much","stupid","attempt","to","creat","the","emot","terribl","do","not","wast","your","time"],"filtered":["oh","god","wrong","sht","ever","see","thi","main","think","come","mind","right","watch","movi","realli","understand","anybodi","opposit","myth","though","mayb","idea","good","effect","miser","especi","mean","role","h","graham","opinion","destroi","posit","intent","produc","charact","plai","affect","annoi","wai","everi","time","appear","remind","re","watch","movi","destroi","spirit","moment","whole","movi","becaus","much","time","see","stupid","face","much","stupid","attempt","creat","emot","terribl","wast","time"],"filtered2":["oh","god","wrong","sht","ever","see","main","think","come","mind","right","watch","realli","understand","anybodi","opposit","myth","though","mayb","idea","good","effect","miser","especi","mean","role","h","graham","opinion","destroi","posit","intent","produc","charact","plai","affect","annoi","wai","everi","time","appear","remind","re","watch","destroi","spirit","moment","whole","becaus","time","see","stupid","face","stupid","attempt","creat","emot","terribl","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,8,10,12,13,22,25,33,34,40,44,68,85,86,88,89,106,111,121,123,128,136,163,166,169,177,179,188,212,234,238,251,261,267,271,352,362,506,509,538,644,738,811,894,1209,1330,1652,1849,3068,3176,3565,3686],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,8,10,12,13,22,25,33,34,40,44,68,85,86,88,89,106,111,121,123,128,136,163,166,169,177,179,188,212,234,238,251,261,267,271,352,362,506,509,538,644,738,811,894,1209,1330,1652,1849,3068,3176,3565,3686],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,1.9218995441445863,2.825681057716235,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,2.0064197866819473,2.011190219103739,2.031112399272319,2.0317223413467334,1.9940046109572438,2.159084361316692,2.1183455303375887,2.2190595059394194,2.2619070973220485,2.3409902041158843,4.693651971159972,2.4000574358028657,2.4423870329693536,2.4214486257841834,2.458149992634611,2.507968722980095,2.5378812223426954,2.5983793339432615,2.673149229007135,2.597304642813496,2.6942272927333892,2.7085302779237206,2.7085302779237206,2.757740698455715,3.1236456418640466,3.058539100262467,3.449627639403373,3.360519385990158,3.43462735814388,3.5670958631572662,7.479663562575727,3.8425769395797067,4.091229668125752,4.3095999406873045,4.370968887063596,4.646072177308517,4.798834931860927,5.501738287366237,5.7959777603641776,5.649374286172302,5.7959777603641776]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.957877950839383E-5,7.904216119416879E-5,7.965663862686821E-5,7.919638172027158E-5,7.919767926382088E-5,7.908697673493042E-5,7.932219248485103E-5,7.905354274890381E-5,7.923128393143772E-5,8.79027844565563E-5,0.9224440316048335,7.892593290152612E-5,8.039904629999391E-5,8.154595636203047E-5,7.89834848684505E-5,7.876520859443904E-5,0.07133877496049083,7.932962437553784E-5,7.908350452494561E-5,7.914905068938913E-5,7.991486417666054E-5,7.940821995912967E-5,7.949863826429054E-5,7.958428913052352E-5,8.019505766341881E-5,7.977566008847567E-5,8.312927728711617E-5,7.894939685770873E-5,7.895150893896448E-5,7.915153214038933E-5,8.083387942645908E-5,7.93250279012218E-5,8.514869769232737E-5,7.954815749898399E-5,7.903532972574073E-5,7.94001298730508E-5,7.895613435027709E-5,7.90027916165052E-5,7.876481287166263E-5,7.87852480979993E-5,7.896258411646014E-5,7.979547206200498E-5,7.938999773587638E-5,7.907611187743149E-5,8.003696955310928E-5,7.910646172127944E-5,8.173477661691328E-5,8.053284290244087E-5,7.880483053917925E-5,7.897899403391698E-5,7.895160114323893E-5,8.117359598181006E-5,7.898016909078144E-5,7.877825376829752E-5,7.964295784377142E-5,7.900051228569681E-5,8.495636858238954E-5,7.8935405598447E-5,7.880391920652296E-5,7.918018479178426E-5,7.99655856787552E-5,7.917494657217593E-5,7.8789340305

{"value":"Weak plot, predictable violence, only semi interesting characters. Like the writer (also one of the stars?) was fictionalizing his own screw ups and added an incredulous fantasies of drugs and murder to make it \"hot\". From the predictable rap and house soundtrack, to the family conflicts, it's poorly acted, stereotypical, and ultimately terribly boring. Even the title has been done before - IMDb lists FIVE movies with the same name released in 2007-2008!! <br /><br />Note: Saw it on Showtime, which listed the synopsis for one of the other movies. Was halfway thru before I realized no one was an undercover cop. Even tho another stereotype, would have made it interesting if it happened.","finished_norm":["weak","plot","predict","violenc","onli","semi","interest","charact","like","the","writer","conjur","on","of","the","star","be","fiction","hi","own","screw","up","and","add","a","incredul","fantasi","of","drug","and","murder","to","make","it","hot","from","the","predict","rap","and","hous","soundtrack","to","the","famili","conflict","it","poorli","act","stereotyp","and","ultim","terribli","bore","even","the","titl","have","be","do","befor","imdb","list","five","movi","with","the","same","name","releas","in","br","br","note","see","it","on","showtim","which","list","the","synopsi","for","on","of","the","other","movi","be","halfwai","thru","befor","i","realiz","no","on","be","a","undercov","cop","even","tho","anoth","stereotyp","would","have","make","it","interest","if","it","happen"],"filtered":["weak","plot","predict","violenc","onli","semi","interest","charact","like","writer","conjur","star","fiction","hi","screw","add","incredul","fantasi","drug","murder","make","hot","predict","rap","hous","soundtrack","famili","conflict","poorli","act","stereotyp","ultim","terribli","bore","even","titl","befor","imdb","list","five","movi","name","releas","br","br","note","see","showtim","list","synopsi","movi","halfwai","thru","befor","realiz","undercov","cop","even","tho","anoth","stereotyp","make","interest","happen"],"filtered2":["weak","plot","predict","violenc","onli","semi","interest","charact","like","writer","conjur","star","fiction","screw","add","incredul","fantasi","drug","murder","make","hot","predict","rap","hous","soundtrack","famili","conflict","poorli","act","stereotyp","ultim","terribli","bore","even","titl","befor","imdb","list","five","name","releas","note","see","showtim","list","synopsi","halfwai","thru","befor","realiz","undercov","cop","even","tho","anoth","stereotyp","make","interest","happen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,10,11,21,32,39,60,73,79,94,100,108,143,182,213,264,273,287,299,327,337,379,398,405,452,476,505,560,592,602,604,666,697,735,796,916,996,1153,1331,1396,1703,2557,2760,3605,4567,5789,6567,7584,7724],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,10,11,21,32,39,60,73,79,94,100,108,143,182,213,264,273,287,299,327,337,379,398,405,452,476,505,560,592,602,604,666,697,735,796,916,996,1153,1331,1396,1703,2557,2760,3605,4567,5789,6567,7584,7724],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.852034211452262,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.162015545335049,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,3.676353282473182,1.8950689206770979,3.893901213901217,2.08112281984698,2.1405462403177813,2.138507503627933,2.3409902041158843,2.7365296724240786,2.8432628718938773,2.757740698455715,2.9674191958529437,2.841890188081905,2.7949961309240425,2.9674191958529437,5.947318931426056,3.1272886331425473,3.143848349181566,3.109204957709252,3.41740676039221,3.6105180246075443,3.3956930001684253,3.4623020803001006,3.509308122676031,7.111656276621848,7.145555393249395,3.6621227969605474,3.7952092507568174,3.7132521434831514,3.850067611308864,4.100845126825194,4.1302590120314875,4.213208095012239,4.513582994262438,4.409683399244287,4.751432692966343,5.2288713006995975,5.583416318380505,5.719991853386255,6.032366538428407,6.437831646536572,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.610277137931003E-5,6.565702493833293E-5,6.616744570002846E-5,6.578512949386829E-5,6.578620730914925E-5,6.569425133792723E-5,0.0745650156828002,6.566647912090821E-5,6.581412130424287E-5,0.16774435034360433,0.6374016943401255,6.556047894574761E-5,6.678413277402031E-5,6.773682310292182E-5,6.560828496307451E-5,6.542697197074614E-5,6.705896594412972E-5,6.589580860748939E-5,6.569136711798538E-5,6.57458135816E-5,6.638194288869693E-5,6.596109467904878E-5,6.603620139206294E-5,6.610734799250109E-5,6.661468792589872E-5,6.626631186151615E-5,6.905202172468477E-5,6.557996947501653E-5,6.558172389278024E-5,6.574787481939692E-5,6.714533050693911E-5,6.589199050808222E-5,7.072946998650827E-5,6.607733495392505E-5,6.565135032258141E-5,6.595437458213583E-5,6.558556602894293E-5,6.562432227302852E-5,6.542664326034897E-5,6.54436179501213E-5,6.559092358056764E-5,6.628276884118925E-5,6.594595823859095E-5,6.56852263541846E-5,6.648337072955398E-5,6.571043670299459E-5,6.789366820933596E-5,6.689527202844864E-5,6.545988426685001E-5,6.560455461422642E-5,6.558180048302341E-5,6.742751887337119E-5,6.560553068492956E-5,6.543780805230579E-5,6.615608164439801E-5,6.562242892804063E-5,7.056971022062161E-5,6.556834751979179E-5,6.54591272608416E-5,6.577167538125864E-5,6.642407512391959E-5,6.576732421081669E-5,6.544701717595633E-5,6.55994005317616E-5,6.542743460718078E-5,6.694128983311467E-5,6.599106124333613E-5,6.585049062

{"value":"I am a MAJOR fan of the horror genre! I LOVE horror/slasher/gore flicks of all kinds. Some of my favorites are the really \"good\" bad horror flicks.

The FX are not even worth discussing. The \"set\" is an absolute JOKE!! The sad thing is I think there MAY be some real potential in a couple of the actors, but this vehicle left them NOTHING to work with!!!<br /><br />Suffice it to say I saw it for \"free\" & feel I was robbed!!

{"value":"What a piece of junk this movie was. The premise was okay, but even in the beginning with crappy effects to blend in a giant with normal sized people (even the effects in Hercules was better) I knew this would be bad. But the really awful part of the movie is the dialogs. It's completely incoherent, silly and stupid. I felt like it had been written by some 9th grader in creative class and gotten a D-. I want to slap Casper van Diem and the other actors for following this movie through.<br /><br />I've had my share of cheesy and bad movies (I love the tremors series), but this... I do not recommend it at all. It's silly and the totally flabbergastingly bad dialogs will make you cringe.","finished_norm":["what","a","piec","of","junk","thi","movi","be","the","premis","be","okai","but","even","in","the","begin","with","crappi","effect","to","blend","in","a","giant","with","normal","size","peopl","even","the","effect","in","hercul","be","well","i","know","thi","would","be","bad","but","the","realli","aw","part","of","the","movi","be","the","dialog","it","complet","incoher","silli","and","stupid","i","feel","like","it","have","be","write","by","some","th","grader","in","creativ","class","and","get","a","have","i","want","to","slap","casper","van","diem","and","the","other","actor","for","follow","thi","movi","throughbr","br","i","have","have","my","share","of","cheesi","and","bad","movi","i","love","the","tremor","seri","but","thi","i","do","not","recommend","it","at","all","it","silli","and","the","total","flabbergastingli","bad","dialog","will","make","you","cring"],"filtered":["piec","junk","thi","movi","premis","okai","even","begin","crappi","effect","blend","giant","normal","size","peopl","even","effect","hercul","well","know","thi","bad","realli","aw","part","movi","dialog","complet","incoher","silli","stupid","feel","like","write","th","grader","creativ","class","get","want","slap","casper","van","diem","actor","follow","thi","movi","throughbr","br","share","cheesi","bad","movi","love","tremor","seri","thi","recommend","silli","total","flabbergastingli","bad","dialog","make","cring"],"filtered2":["piec","junk","premis","okai","even","begin","crappi","effect","blend","giant","normal","size","peopl","even","effect","hercul","well","know","bad","realli","aw","part","dialog","complet","incoher","silli","stupid","feel","like","write","th","grader","creativ","class","get","want","slap","casper","van","diem","actor","follow","throughbr","share","cheesi","bad","love","tremor","recommend","silli","total","flabbergastingli","bad","dialog","make","cring"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,9,13,20,23,26,37,41,43,54,61,65,103,106,136,138,147,184,191,218,260,298,385,432,484,543,628,700,818,853,907,1077,1124,1128,1482,1491,1537,1827,2183,3344,4243,5204,5673,6036,8085],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,9,13,20,23,26,37,41,43,54,61,65,103,106,136,138,147,184,191,218,260,298,385,432,484,543,628,700,818,853,907,1077,1124,1128,1482,1491,1537,1827,2183,3344,4243,5204,5673,6036,8085],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,3.205071257016622,1.1317941569733974,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.8113893252729412,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,2.098582041218749,4.318168722633384,2.346825985579986,2.2907365189289424,2.2844323215331563,2.496249838866882,2.5460113484259455,2.5940874818617203,2.6754694156628323,2.7819920465008363,6.18993968377476,6.47017040719651,3.291526514503207,3.477726550625732,3.607563812710113,3.616452760127359,4.202455303235976,3.8962296530720266,4.181290492043933,4.235066888824737,4.181290492043933,4.251780369798478,4.506310234933358,4.558366596889411,4.550761997504193,4.770124825978496,5.014723312293965,5.541743621979936,6.948657270302562,6.1754673820690815,6.342521466732247,6.600350576034347,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.563262309829583E-5,7.512261463928015E-5,7.570662133499556E-5,7.526918767039232E-5,7.527042087128866E-5,7.516520786481476E-5,7.538875972462497E-5,7.513343180492234E-5,7.530235914900424E-5,8.354385688199964E-5,0.15258773490564168,7.501214988089724E-5,7.641221446011854E-5,7.750225148990867E-5,7.506684795807115E-5,7.485939557861028E-5,7.672666955989822E-5,7.539582308235294E-5,7.51619078349485E-5,7.522420369298401E-5,7.595204198359616E-5,7.547052126430187E-5,7.555645590212449E-5,7.563785950901391E-5,7.621834122203008E-5,7.581974075454405E-5,7.90070586195282E-5,7.503445030527315E-5,7.50364576525403E-5,7.522656209367065E-5,7.682548506024284E-5,7.539145453823009E-5,8.092633990692513E-5,0.8415022470017905,7.511612193004259E-5,7.546283234980712E-5,7.504085369873052E-5,7.508519732215912E-5,7.485901947895427E-5,7.487844136228796E-5,7.504698363359265E-5,7.583857029096106E-5,7.545320264554643E-5,7.515488177440083E-5,7.606809239266594E-5,7.518372662870778E-5,7.768170851675802E-5,7.653937635009996E-5,7.489705274841699E-5,7.50625798152601E-5,7.503654528458467E-5,7.714835573443308E-5,7.506369660334732E-5,7.48717938677495E-5,7.569361895524004E-5,7.508303101891834E-5,8.074354802229684E-5,7.502115284525994E-5,7.489618660696902E-5,7.525379391598694E-5,7.60002483053644E-5,7.524881544946874E-5,7.4882330645007E-5,7.505668268313774E-5,7.485992491204612E-5,7.659202841299375E-5,7.550480802437265E-5,7.5343971728404E-5,7.527808001992076E-5,7.555248058772344E-5,7.485719390326132E-5,7.527965818960

YES, but tiring as the back stabbing gets so tiring.. its not team work, its not personal, its just business. watch your back jack.","finished_norm":["i","love","the","apprentic","for","the","two","seasonsbr","br","but","now","with","season","or","be","it","thing","be","get","just","plain","too","tiringbr","br","i","us","to","like","the","show","but","it","becom","donald","trump","own","ego","fest","grant","it","hi","compani","you","will","be","work","for","but","come","on","some","of","the","thing","sai","you","re","fire","be","just","insultingbr","br","after","watch","the","show","i","would","not","want","to","work","for","him","not","becaus","he","be","arrog","pompou","or","such","it","just","that","the","show","be","unrealist","and","the","wai","he","handl","thing","make","me","just","squirm","good","entertain","ye","but","tire","a","the","back","stab","get","so","tire","it","not","team","work","it","not","person","it","just","busi","watch","your","back","jack"],"filtered":["love","apprentic","two","seasonsbr","br","season","thing","get","plain","tiringbr","br","us","like","show","becom","donald","trump","ego","fest","grant","hi","compani","work","come","thing","sai","re","fire","insultingbr","br","watch","show","want","work","becaus","arrog","pompou","show","unrealist","wai","handl","thing","make","squirm","good","entertain","ye","tire","back","stab","get","tire","team","work","person","busi","watch","back","jack"],"filtered2":["love","apprentic","two","seasonsbr","season","thing","get","plain","tiringbr","us","like","show","becom","donald","trump","ego","fest","grant","compani","work","come","thing","re","fire","insultingbr","watch","show","want","work","becaus","arrog","pompou","show","unrealist","wai","handl","thing","make","squirm","good","entertain","ye","tire","back","stab","get","tire","team","work","person","busi","watch","back","jack"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,22,28,29,33,34,37,47,48,54,56,63,68,115,153,195,209,551,586,723,777,790,817,882,900,945,1066,1264,1584,2364,2664,2793,2832,5396,6723,8341],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,22,28,29,33,34,37,47,48,54,56,63,68,115,153,195,209,551,586,723,777,790,817,882,900,945,1066,1264,1584,2364,2664,2793,2832,5396,6723,8341],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,1.9218995441445863,1.2979240167361772,4.635688258055728,3.9586154332014196,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.7064694353107215,5.086534867203742,1.8113893252729412,1.8610609350701788,3.745925514644013,2.0064197866819473,2.201553588425805,2.3409902041158843,2.51289241584188,2.6026896854443837,3.528202072035993,3.4572130107926293,3.865219416329466,4.086456389373095,3.749984152751882,4.197121957260614,3.9612932464190886,7.8402703478511615,3.9782428047328615,4.3095999406873045,4.327618446189983,4.706176101378222,5.129498826886393,5.3560264761848435,5.444579873526289,5.3560264761848435,6.255510089742618,6.543192162194399,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.856797927635729E-5,8.797074468659352E-5,8.865463334210338E-5,8.814238592618327E-5,8.814383003993942E-5,8.802062258004646E-5,8.828240824443006E-5,8.798341189901033E-5,8.818123068271708E-5,9.783226181875776E-5,0.5577395184508304,8.78413872740057E-5,8.948090320718808E-5,9.075736795361693E-5,8.790544029725335E-5,8.7662507587898E-5,8.984913918287857E-5,8.8290679639699E-5,8.8016758150058E-5,8.808970839345127E-5,8.894202798781067E-5,8.837815336148485E-5,8.847878529662086E-5,8.857411126407584E-5,8.925387206335293E-5,8.878709943934957E-5,0.2391121499769147,8.786750171302776E-5,8.786985237447352E-5,8.809247014855885E-5,8.9964854978896E-5,8.828556394875121E-5,9.476707407692025E-5,8.853389821213934E-5,8.796314153713707E-5,8.836914942123088E-5,8.787500027113402E-5,8.792692793091858E-5,8.766206716437206E-5,8.768481074895421E-5,8.788217860135179E-5,8.880914936863734E-5,8.83578727602814E-5,0.15549675384559156,8.907792635817588E-5,8.804230858576081E-5,9.096751729901691E-5,8.962981344162462E-5,8.770660521797374E-5,8.790044217913247E-5,8.786995499412059E-5,9.0342945834524E-5,8.790174997013735E-5,8.76770263414538E-5,8.863940718104278E-5,8.792439112745103E-5,9.45530195170433E-5,8.785193000448942E-5,8.770559094140006E-5,8.812435939655479E-5,8.899847897856646E-5,8.811852946892106E-5,8.768936521099916E-5,8.789353646762588E-5,8.766312745259202E-5,8.969147052324104E-5,8.841830414471837E-5,8.822996021131116E-5,8.815279912351123E-5,8.847413008899926E-5,8.765992936267332E-5,8.81546472056501E-5,8.958445706233887E-5,8.781702082524203E-5,8.99904463350965E-5,0.04091081975070361,8.87383172972009E-5,8.819598773919982E-5,8.763244539303004E-5,8.774107182774204E-5]}}
{"value":"I cannot believe the same guy directed this crap and Dracula 2000. Dracula 2000 was innovative, fresh, and well written, if poorly acted.<br /><br />This pile can't even claim that. It starts with the defeat of Dracula at the end of Dracula 2000. Then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that. Following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow, but Craven chose to go in the style of his older films, having no good tie but the main villain's name.<br /><br />Even the actor playing Dracula was different (going from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to a blonde here).<br /><br />Avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in

{"value":"I will say that at least the movie makes sense, but it's bad. The acting for the most part is not good (I think only Sky showed any promise) and you feel awkward watching it. All of the scenes that should be meaningful are really shallow, like when Ng comes out to her parents. There are a lot of corny details, like the kanji tattoo on the Sky's shoulder, the magnets on the girls' refrigerator and the god awful decor at the sets...and the music...and clothes..and everything. Real life has never been like this movie. The boy says at one point \"I'm gay, not corny.\" And not aware.
