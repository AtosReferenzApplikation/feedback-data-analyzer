{"value":"Protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars Goldie Hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors. The story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an Arab dignitary. The story goes downhill halfway through the movie and Goldie's charm just doesn't save this movie. Unless you are a Goldie Hawn fan don't go out of your way to see this film.","finished_norm":["protocol","be","a","implaus","movi","whose","onli","save","grace","be","that","it","star","goldi","hawn","along","with","a","good","cast","of","support","actor","the","stori","revolv","around","a","ditzi","cocktail","waitress","who","becom","famou","after","inadvert","save","the","life","of","a","arab","dignitari","the","stori","go","downhil","halfwai","through","the","movi","and","goldi","charm","just","doe","not","save","thi","movi","unless","you","be","a","goldi","hawn","fan","do","not","go","out","of","your","wai","to","see","thi","film"],"filtered":["protocol","implaus","movi","whose","onli","save","grace","star","goldi","hawn","along","good","cast","support","actor","stori","revolv","around","ditzi","cocktail","waitress","becom","famou","inadvert","save","life","arab","dignitari","stori","go","downhil","halfwai","movi","goldi","charm","doe","save","thi","movi","unless","goldi","hawn","fan","go","wai","see","thi","film"],"filtered2":["protocol","implaus","whose","onli","save","grace","star","goldi","hawn","along","good","cast","support","actor","stori","revolv","around","ditzi","cocktail","waitress","becom","famou","inadvert","save","life","arab","dignitari","stori","go","downhil","halfwai","goldi","charm","doe","save","unless","goldi","hawn","fan","go","wai","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,11,17,18,33,41,75,92,98,100,115,140,189,324,459,460,598,797,865,1149,1396,1500,2058,2526,2855,3923,4163,5386,5683,6510,6736],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,11,17,18,33,41,75,92,98,100,115,140,189,324,459,460,598,797,865,1149,1396,1500,2058,2526,2855,3923,4163,5386,5683,6510,6736],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,0.9913098153388195,2.5541073880211935,1.2153159934048174,1.4018535447685214,1.5687599167621034,1.9742250248702675,2.0489535369135887,2.0881990796736947,2.1405462403177813,2.201553588425805,2.317169775997098,7.494580422226358,2.8753661172782943,3.2850956241729166,3.216957819005698,3.5642670069567886,3.7987743169213135,3.9201351739255808,4.297765483040301,4.409683399244287,4.605250182788262,4.9676558014359795,5.143104478942172,5.7959777603641776,18.89420911248424,12.596139408322827,6.2980697041614135,6.2980697041614135,6.489124940924123,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.9976296075729617E-4,2.9949732564315705E-4,2.9957127384642074E-4,2.995110504379537E-4,2.9953939560615957E-4,2.9949567430525653E-4,2.995888216179574E-4,2.994511142336534E-4,2.994973889388551E-4,2.9980688703667345E-4,3.0218576745713783E-4,2.994978836310938E-4,2.9978152705322186E-4,2.9981275911628626E-4,2.996765620081259E-4,2.995122301686317E-4,2.996152739593816E-4,2.997562739259176E-4,2.9952769269367126E-4,2.995265975907086E-4,2.997960672979393E-4,2.995566070978501E-4,2.9955706045081454E-4,2.997489599110464E-4,2.9952780074085216E-4,2.9981634261876745E-4,2.9960275641329885E-4,2.994966544075059E-4,2.9963243339164666E-4,2.997238855294228E-4,2.9955807647149006E-4,2.99718513253905E-4,2.998656675614939E-4,3.001439893977633E-4,2.996022386913128E-4,2.995120485097161E-4,2.9962003951784164E-4,2.995424667552165E-4,2.9945143384220956E-4,2.995275999348191E-4,2.998277777761904E-4,2.9966330336679163E-4,2.997191962607564E-4,2.994663375066467E-4,2.995276760970999E-4,2.995119358817502E-4,2.996133179564693E-4,2.9966527128028855E-4,2.9960433604071785E-4,2.9955684822412964E-4,2.995126765517529E-4,3.001263293859027E-4,2.995880425688496E-4,2.9952760744573684E-4,2.995864381639205E-4,2.994969608332975E-4,0.9763286762691163,2.995436873606932E-4,2.995130970292157E-4,2.994967898727945E-4,2.997363944890621E-4,2.9961607278659245E-4,2.9949666467527246E-4,2.9946621549728904E-4,2.994361008613639E-4,2.997068384968046E-4,2.995113368004337E-4,2.9964748351410646E-4,2.9973542245412846E-4,2.995994383256625E-4,2.9952800416013054E-4,2.9946660807754217E-4,2.9954321716891744E-4,2.994664467811181E-4,2.994821622959343E-4,2.9946661655319356E-4,2.9966101223488113E-4,2.995718235278458E-4,2.994970644262302E-4,2.9952607633160786E-4]}}

{"value":"Gregory Peck's acting was excellent, as one would expect, and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic \"moment.\" But, the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch, for me anyway. I tried to like it, but had to fast-forward through the last thirty minutes or so. I feel I wasted a couple of good hours. Had it not been for Gregory Peck, I wouldn't have lasted fifteen minutes. 4/10.","finished_norm":["gregori","peck","act","be","excel","a","on","would","expect","and","the","cinematographi","quit","stun","even","when","plai","directli","into","some","melodramat","moment","but","the","rest","of","the","film","be","overact","and","hard","to","watch","for","me","anywai","i","try","to","like","it","but","have","to","fastforward","through","the","last","thirti","minut","or","so","i","feel","i","wast","a","coupl","of","good","hour","have","it","not","be","for","gregori","peck","i","would","not","have","last","fifteen","minut"],"filtered":["gregori","peck","act","excel","expect","cinematographi","quit","stun","even","plai","directli","melodramat","moment","rest","film","overact","hard","watch","anywai","try","like","fastforward","last","thirti","minut","feel","wast","coupl","good","hour","gregori","peck","last","fifteen","minut"],"filtered2":["gregori","peck","act","excel","expect","cinematographi","quit","stun","even","plai","directli","melodramat","moment","rest","overact","hard","watch","anywai","try","like","fastforward","last","thirti","minut","feel","wast","coupl","good","hour","gregori","peck","last","fifteen","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,7,21,36,40,43,59,89,120,130,144,171,174,188,226,253,386,580,629,1415,1556,1987,2067,2282,2803,3252,3888,3961],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,7,21,36,40,43,59,89,120,130,144,171,174,188,226,253,386,580,629,1415,1556,1987,2067,2282,2803,3252,3888,3961],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.162015545335049,1.4680183469605717,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,3.7386508898401445,1.9940046109572438,2.2044500422972613,2.2642139034199635,4.586221753978809,2.373087554090762,2.456282578459816,2.5378812223426954,2.5940874818617203,2.7073305177318163,3.0433232530252132,3.5039747767006686,3.488143311483988,4.4919214974812585,4.589376833631972,4.890269137820559,4.956227105612356,5.116075806554253,5.3560264761848435,5.501738287366237,12.511020179485236,12.429376190444724]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.5117090321374104E-4,3.508597129228464E-4,3.509463428962945E-4,3.5087579145560765E-4,3.5090899768727636E-4,3.508577783882375E-4,3.5096690002838426E-4,3.508055764732557E-4,3.508597870734599E-4,3.5122236264410154E-4,3.54009209864799E-4,3.508603666030983E-4,3.5119265354237767E-4,3.512292417578391E-4,3.5106968748413247E-4,3.508771735045662E-4,3.5099788882235196E-4,3.5116306962212944E-4,3.508952877801605E-4,3.508940048721737E-4,3.5120968737089827E-4,3.5092916086910286E-4,3.5092969196997534E-4,3.511545012879966E-4,3.508954143569264E-4,3.5123343981419613E-4,3.5098322457579933E-4,3.508589265734278E-4,3.5101799101680564E-4,3.5112512676747524E-4,3.509308822334336E-4,3.5111883317189187E-4,3.512912237533607E-4,3.516172764797547E-4,3.5098261806691976E-4,3.5087696069199825E-4,3.510034716517466E-4,3.5091259552399876E-4,3.508059508931809E-4,3.508951791136001E-4,3.512468360475081E-4,3.51054155047967E-4,3.5111963331121624E-4,3.508234104661994E-4,3.50895268337355E-4,3.508768287488642E-4,3.5099559737411014E-4,3.510564604494029E-4,3.509850751019153E-4,3.5092944334740896E-4,3.5087769644030005E-4,3.515965878586515E-4,3.509659873760067E-4,3.50895187912605E-4,3.509641078231539E-4,3.508592855498061E-4,0.9722691552224233,3.509140254575924E-4,3.5087818902767654E-4,3.5085908527037835E-4,3.511397809550497E-4,3.509988246446845E-4,3.508589386020682E-4,3.508232675328089E-4,3.507879883780025E-4,3.511051562486809E-4,3.508761269279105E-4,3.510356221647111E-4,3.511386422206819E-4,3.509793374516888E-4,3.5089565266165735E-4,3.5082372743873495E-4,3.509134746301314E-4,3.5082353848073033E-4,3.508419491326619E-4,3.508237373679209E-4,3.510514709976749E-4,3.50946986845507E-4,3.5085940690844116E-4,3.508933942195808E-4]}}

{"value":"I have to admit I've caught this one a few times on the USA Network. There's just something about the, well, sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it's on. Yes, you're right about the sub-par acting, the plot which only an seven year old could like, etc. But I can't help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors. Then again, a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel.","finished_norm":["i","have","to","admit","i","have","catch","thi","on","a","few","time","on","the","usa","network","there","just","someth","about","the","good","sheer","stupid","of","thi","flick","which","make","me","want","to","watch","it","whenev","it","on","ye","you","re","right","about","the","subpar","act","the","plot","which","onli","a","seven","year","old","can","like","etc","but","i","ca","not","help","feel","sympathet","toward","some","of","the","actor","then","again","a","few","of","thi","actor","sign","up","for","the","even","much","atroci","sequel"],"filtered":["admit","catch","thi","time","usa","network","someth","good","sheer","stupid","thi","flick","make","want","watch","whenev","ye","re","right","subpar","act","plot","onli","seven","year","old","like","etc","ca","help","feel","sympathet","toward","actor","thi","actor","sign","even","much","atroci","sequel"],"filtered2":["admit","catch","time","usa","network","someth","good","sheer","stupid","flick","make","want","watch","whenev","ye","re","right","subpar","act","plot","onli","seven","year","old","like","etc","ca","help","feel","sympathet","toward","actor","actor","sign","even","atroci","sequel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,7,8,11,21,32,37,41,43,53,57,67,68,81,121,136,185,209,257,387,429,512,563,691,876,1219,1498,1509,1626,1791,2278,2515,2629],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,7,8,11,21,32,37,41,43,53,57,67,68,81,121,136,185,209,257,387,429,512,563,691,876,1219,1498,1509,1626,1791,2278,2515,2629],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.162015545335049,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,3.1375198335242067,1.6608112036218214,1.7003182735607676,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,2.0064197866819473,1.949757232424728,2.2190595059394194,2.346825985579986,2.518833027372001,2.6026896854443837,2.7602659523229094,3.360519385990158,3.2872346624216657,3.369778711402955,3.459754308221302,3.5929222627171646,3.8844878351953436,4.246178114249808,4.506310234933358,4.751432692966343,4.613282354485526,4.8184434032493035,5.02684467282631,5.259176650194926,5.2288713006995975]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.2343694346142896E-4,3.2315032963437E-4,3.232301179470343E-4,3.231651383541246E-4,3.231957221011734E-4,3.231485478809411E-4,3.2324905156570424E-4,3.231004686475251E-4,3.2315039792888865E-4,3.234843388484492E-4,3.260510929237655E-4,3.231509316897816E-4,3.2345697604314096E-4,3.2349067467952363E-4,3.233437213125686E-4,3.231664112548313E-4,3.2327759299869525E-4,3.234297285330166E-4,3.231830949432508E-4,3.2318191335379057E-4,3.234726646135258E-4,3.232142928820688E-4,3.2321478203889046E-4,3.234218368888709E-4,3.23183211523531E-4,3.234945411915386E-4,3.2326408687093886E-4,3.23149605387429E-4,3.232961076087369E-4,3.233947822409883E-4,3.232158783004865E-4,3.233889856863756E-4,3.2354776160499975E-4,3.238480640966556E-4,3.232635282615085E-4,3.231662152492799E-4,3.2328273492036E-4,3.231990357963056E-4,3.231008134973833E-4,3.2318299485870554E-4,3.2350687944825824E-4,3.233294155610616E-4,3.233897226341553E-4,3.2311689418880604E-4,3.2318307703595406E-4,3.2316609372644414E-4,3.232754825191292E-4,3.2333153889185887E-4,3.2326579125050234E-4,3.232145530514595E-4,3.231668928913616E-4,3.2382900937340606E-4,3.232482109906659E-4,3.231830029628031E-4,3.232464798767717E-4,3.231499360134048E-4,0.9744592174568528,3.2320035279992593E-4,3.2316734657631665E-4,3.2314975155118045E-4,3.234082791041812E-4,3.232784549138257E-4,3.231496164660993E-4,3.2311676254367683E-4,3.2308426958399804E-4,3.2337638890743176E-4,3.231654473322752E-4,3.233123463248039E-4,3.234072303021307E-4,3.232605067350857E-4,3.231834310079845E-4,3.231171861282211E-4,3.231998454744365E-4,3.231170120933028E-4,3.2313396875153784E-4,3.231171952732428E-4,3.2332694348545787E-4,3.2323071103992185E-4,3.2315004778765954E-4,3.231813509278995E-4]}}

I stayed only because I could not belive it.........","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","movi","in","new","york","citi","i","be","wait","for","a","bu","the","next","morn","so","it","be","or","in","the","morn","it","be","rain","and","do","not","want","to","wait","at","the","port","authorti","so","i","go","across","the","street","and","see","the","wrong","film","of","my","life","it","be","so","bad","that","i","choos","to","stai","and","see","the","whole","moviei","have","yet","to","see","anyth","els","that","bad","sinc","the","year","be","so","call","me","crazi","i","stai","onli","becaus","i","can","not","beliv","it"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","new","york","citi","wait","bu","next","morn","morn","rain","want","wait","port","authorti","go","across","street","see","wrong","film","life","bad","choos","stai","see","whole","moviei","yet","see","anyth","els","bad","sinc","year","call","crazi","stai","onli","becaus","beliv"],"filtered2":["see","new","york","citi","wait","bu","next","morn","morn","rain","want","wait","port","authorti","go","across","street","see","wrong","life","bad","choos","stai","see","whole","moviei","yet","see","anyth","els","bad","sinc","year","call","crazi","stai","onli","becaus","beliv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,9,11,22,25,37,57,75,87,104,111,142,162,194,196,297,331,366,503,584,595,664,712,827,1693,2048,2061,5377,7317],"values":[4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,9,11,22,25,37,57,75,87,104,111,142,162,194,196,297,331,366,503,584,595,664,712,827,1693,2048,2061,5377,7317],"values":[2.6228008218775787,0.9708269144703846,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.4876543214774305,1.834162586674748,1.9742250248702675,2.115024371522662,2.0728240170322856,2.1183455303375887,2.2844323215331563,2.3586007221245198,2.5378812223426954,2.478925055209576,2.813490713560207,5.864548499100348,6.01738979237035,3.3490645070153917,3.5146700658174166,3.6284289511740746,3.6905607322810807,3.7165362186843414,4.062925891962901,9.540249651956993,5.214056214914456,5.0768550934009715,6.255510089742618,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.234369434614289E-4,3.231503296343699E-4,3.232301179470342E-4,3.2316513835412453E-4,3.231957221011733E-4,3.2314854788094107E-4,3.232490515657042E-4,3.23100468647525E-4,3.231503979288886E-4,3.2348433884844916E-4,3.260510929237654E-4,3.2315093168978155E-4,3.234569760431409E-4,3.234906746795235E-4,3.2334372131256856E-4,3.2316641125483124E-4,3.232775929986952E-4,3.2342972853301654E-4,3.2318309494325074E-4,3.231819133537905E-4,3.234726646135257E-4,3.2321429288206875E-4,3.232147820388904E-4,3.234218368888708E-4,3.231832115235309E-4,3.2349454119153854E-4,3.2326408687093875E-4,3.2314960538742894E-4,3.2329610760873685E-4,3.2339478224098825E-4,3.2321587830048645E-4,3.2338898568637554E-4,3.235477616049997E-4,3.2384806409665556E-4,3.2326352826150844E-4,3.2316621524927983E-4,3.2328273492035996E-4,3.2319903579630557E-4,3.231008134973832E-4,3.231829948587055E-4,3.235068794482582E-4,3.2332941556106155E-4,3.2338972263415525E-4,3.23116894188806E-4,3.23183077035954E-4,3.231660937264441E-4,3.2327548251912913E-4,3.233315388918588E-4,3.232657912505023E-4,3.2321455305145945E-4,3.2316689289136154E-4,3.2382900937340595E-4,3.2324821099066585E-4,3.23183002962803E-4,3.2324647987677164E-4,3.2314993601340476E-4,0.9744592174568528,3.232003527999259E-4,3.231673465763166E-4,3.2314975155118034E-4,3.2340827910418114E-4,3.2327845491382566E-4,3.2314961646609926E-4,3.231167625436768E-4,3.23084269583998E-4,3.233763889074317E-4,3.2316544733227516E-4,3.2331234632480377E-4,3.2340723030213067E-4,3.2326050673508566E-4,3.2318343100798446E-4,3.2311718612822106E-4,3.231998454744364E-4,3.231170120933027E-4,3.231339687515377E-4,3.2311719527324277E-4,3.233269434854578E-4,3.232307110399218E-4,3.231500477876595E-4,3.2318135092789945E-4]}}
{"value":"This is a bit of a first for me, the first time I have ever been disappointed in a Tim Burton film. POTA isn't a bad film (great sets, costumes and the odd great performance) but it could have been made by any off-the-shelf hollywood director. The pacing was very odd, the last third was just spent waiting for the film to end, by myself and the cast. Tim Roth was excellent, probably the only pleasure in the film.

This movie is so bad Leno's character, a sanctimonious buffoon, is less annoying than Morita's character, a sanctimonious fool.","finished_norm":["collus","cours","be","even","wrong","than","the","typic","evil","white","male","corpor","capitalist","movi","of","the","week","thi","movi","be","littl","pleasant","than","a","toothach","jai","leno","can","act","he","good","in","hi","underr","debut","movi","the","silverbear","in","which","he","give","a","perform","consist","with","the","demand","of","hi","charact","thi","movi","be","so","bad","leno","charact","a","sanctimoni","buffoon","be","littl","annoi","than","morita","charact","a","sanctimoni","fool"],"filtered":["collus","cours","even","wrong","typic","evil","white","male","corpor","capitalist","movi","week","thi","movi","littl","pleasant","toothach","jai","leno","act","good","hi","underr","debut","movi","silverbear","give","perform","consist","demand","hi","charact","thi","movi","bad","leno","charact","sanctimoni","buffoon","littl","annoi","morita","charact","sanctimoni","fool"],"filtered2":["collus","cours","even","wrong","typic","evil","white","male","corpor","capitalist","week","littl","pleasant","toothach","jai","leno","act","good","underr","debut","silverbear","give","perform","consist","demand","charact","bad","leno","charact","sanctimoni","buffoon","littl","annoi","morita","charact","sanctimoni","fool"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,9,10,14,21,25,30,105,199,271,321,359,613,649,828,857,1057,1683,2177,2240,2311,2704,3893,5044,5835,7225],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,9,10,14,21,25,30,105,199,271,321,359,613,649,828,857,1057,1683,2177,2240,2311,2704,3893,5044,5835,7225],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,3.3716610723085094,2.2350163994518417,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,2.1765612129984904,2.558331832813986,2.757740698455715,3.09496984188738,3.2189558216683714,3.5364100524538222,3.6375061693251913,3.827761853794566,3.9612932464190886,4.181290492043933,4.662879295624898,5.259176650194926,5.051537285416681,5.0768550934009715,5.426230734858092,5.7959777603641776,6.342521466732247,13.737229125258052,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.8410719480521733E-4,3.837668180012387E-4,3.8386157299313215E-4,3.837844045383322E-4,3.8382072517987627E-4,3.837647020267799E-4,3.838840581770354E-4,3.8370760409826816E-4,3.837668991064325E-4,3.8416348061153313E-4,3.872117060154508E-4,3.8376753299011046E-4,3.8413098509547844E-4,3.8417100491681104E-4,3.8399648606023216E-4,3.837859162095547E-4,3.839179534075696E-4,3.8409862650166016E-4,3.8380572942164253E-4,3.8380432618981584E-4,3.841496165254459E-4,3.8384277946495185E-4,3.838433603777337E-4,3.84089254544138E-4,3.838058678700334E-4,3.8417559670854596E-4,3.8390191380247783E-4,3.837659579001696E-4,3.8393994098527144E-4,3.8405712498963066E-4,3.8384466227590875E-4,3.8405024111820893E-4,3.8423880019885283E-4,3.8459543338499564E-4,3.839012504091778E-4,3.837856834373126E-4,3.839240598500972E-4,3.838246604574239E-4,3.8370801363500894E-4,3.8380561056325385E-4,3.8419024937353427E-4,3.8397949683809156E-4,3.8405111630253813E-4,3.8372711074001746E-4,3.838057081552978E-4,3.837855391192423E-4,3.839154470445761E-4,3.8398201846294813E-4,3.839039378892937E-4,3.838430884368762E-4,3.837864881913902E-4,3.8457280437973466E-4,3.838830599270626E-4,3.8380562018751677E-4,3.8388100409109447E-4,3.837663505449144E-4,0.9696682814560783,3.8382622450437763E-4,3.8378702697849823E-4,3.837661314812947E-4,3.8407315359231353E-4,3.839189770006056E-4,3.837659710569752E-4,3.837269544009155E-4,3.8368836641693453E-4,3.8403528143743804E-4,3.8378477147455614E-4,3.839592257571622E-4,3.840719080561382E-4,3.838976621053005E-4,3.8380612852534644E-4,3.8372745744138246E-4,3.83825622014852E-4,3.8372725076102126E-4,3.8374738814655996E-4,3.837274683018259E-4,3.839765610509321E-4,3.8386227733829096E-4,3.8376648328576634E-4,3.8380365826416393E-4]}}

{"value":"This third Darkman was definitely better than the second one, but still far worse than the original movie. What made this one better than D2 was the fact that The Bad Guy had been changed and Durant was not brought back again.

This made my heart soften and I gave this flick as much as 4/10, i.e. **/*****.","finished_norm":["thi","darkman","be","definit","well","than","the","on","but","still","far","wrong","than","the","origin","movi","what","make","thi","on","well","than","have","be","the","fact","that","the","bad","gui","have","be","chang","and","durant","be","not","bring","back","again","furthermor","there","be","actual","some","hint","of","charact","develop","when","it","come","to","the","bad","gui","famili","and","darkman","himself","thi","make","my","heart","soften","and","i","give","thi","flick","a","much","a","ie"],"filtered":["thi","darkman","definit","well","still","far","wrong","origin","movi","make","thi","well","fact","bad","gui","chang","durant","bring","back","furthermor","actual","hint","charact","develop","come","bad","gui","famili","darkman","thi","make","heart","soften","give","thi","flick","much","ie"],"filtered2":["darkman","definit","well","still","far","wrong","origin","make","well","fact","bad","gui","chang","durant","bring","back","furthermor","actual","hint","charact","develop","come","bad","gui","famili","darkman","make","heart","soften","give","flick","ie"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,9,10,20,25,30,34,52,55,63,64,69,97,101,182,250,257,278,320,392,614,1303,1416,2775,4768],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,9,10,20,25,30,34,52,55,63,64,69,97,101,182,250,257,278,320,392,614,1303,1416,2775,4768],"values":[1.2399534312410465,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,2.330690080046114,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.7122153074726136,3.9073995778510735,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,2.127032521151058,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.7365296724240786,2.6812935439488212,2.7602659523229094,2.8336934208777267,2.938298364153555,3.0670934723591254,3.553030933689863,4.370968887063596,4.484804029712395,5.3064295350454715,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.0972597280253503E-4,4.0936289390420747E-4,4.094639687649664E-4,4.093816534096693E-4,4.094203965271914E-4,4.0936063680070803E-4,4.094879536420346E-4,4.092997306145681E-4,4.0936298041887025E-4,4.097860127004063E-4,4.1303754543909227E-4,4.0936365658065556E-4,4.097513498325733E-4,4.0979403885388983E-4,4.0960788012202743E-4,4.093832659047503E-4,4.095241095810324E-4,4.097168330192721E-4,4.0940440059763496E-4,4.0940290377452663E-4,4.0977122392207583E-4,4.094439217657948E-4,4.0944454142368683E-4,4.0970683598077676E-4,4.0940454828011113E-4,4.097989369041241E-4,4.095070001832172E-4,4.093619764370212E-4,4.0954756366308367E-4,4.096725634830098E-4,4.094459301544981E-4,4.0966522047836666E-4,4.09866355874403E-4,4.1024677540598754E-4,4.0950629254360806E-4,4.0938301760730974E-4,4.095306233046461E-4,4.094245942757451E-4,4.0930016746616E-4,4.0940427381175445E-4,4.098145668571624E-4,4.095897577706035E-4,4.096661540348204E-4,4.093205382898081E-4,4.0940437791289E-4,4.0938286366366453E-4,4.09521436051274E-4,4.095924475801447E-4,4.095091592704483E-4,4.0944425134520384E-4,4.0938387603602907E-4,4.1022263711511584E-4,4.094868888118342E-4,4.094042840779263E-4,4.094846958578793E-4,4.093623952699725E-4,0.9676452483700981,4.094262626398588E-4,4.0938445075859337E-4,4.093621615954778E-4,4.096896611445889E-4,4.0952520144460096E-4,4.0936199047134563E-4,4.09320371523365E-4,4.0927920983858295E-4,4.096492630325298E-4,4.0938204481941984E-4,4.095681346704225E-4,4.096883325349508E-4,4.095024649108099E-4,4.094048263203383E-4,4.093209081150963E-4,4.0942561996612004E-4,4.0932068764978566E-4,4.0934216813750136E-4,4.0932091969989823E-4,4.0958662617539754E-4,4.0946472008779837E-4,4.093625368642343E-4,4.0940219130027164E-4]}}

Hope that Scola will change radically themes and style in his next film.","finished_norm":["i","give","to","thi","film","i","ca","not","understand","how","ettor","scolaon","of","the","great","director","of","italian","cinema","make","a","film","like","thi","so","stupid","and","ridicul","all","the","stori","of","the","peopl","involv","in","the","movi","be","unsubstantialbor","and","not","interest","too","longtoo","bore","the","onli","thing","i","save","in","thi","movi","be","giancarlo","giannini","and","vittorio","gasmann","hope","that","scola","will","chang","radic","theme","and","styl","in","hi","next","film"],"filtered":["give","thi","film","ca","understand","ettor","scolaon","great","director","italian","cinema","make","film","like","thi","stupid","ridicul","stori","peopl","involv","movi","unsubstantialbor","interest","longtoo","bore","onli","thing","save","thi","movi","giancarlo","giannini","vittorio","gasmann","hope","scola","chang","radic","theme","styl","hi","next","film"],"filtered2":["give","ca","understand","ettor","scolaon","great","director","italian","cinema","make","like","stupid","ridicul","stori","peopl","involv","unsubstantialbor","interest","longtoo","bore","onli","thing","save","giancarlo","giannini","vittorio","gasmann","hope","scola","chang","radic","theme","styl","next"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,11,17,23,29,30,51,58,60,81,108,136,181,189,212,241,274,278,297,380,409,534,1030,3189],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,11,17,23,29,30,51,58,60,81,108,136,181,189,212,241,274,278,297,380,409,534,1030,3189],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.364847727375781,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.7139899308309823,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,1.949757232424728,2.138507503627933,2.346825985579986,2.4442286541160034,2.498193474075453,2.5983793339432615,2.6627744961815836,2.748952192422636,2.8336934208777267,2.813490713560207,3.102062070196872,3.2209578243390444,3.4933926673701317,4.297765483040301,5.822646007446338]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.727937778115476E-4,4.7237481134278854E-4,4.7249144433271864E-4,4.7239645843876463E-4,4.724411651601184E-4,4.723722068105859E-4,4.725191211249948E-4,4.723019255305386E-4,4.7237491117437593E-4,4.728630594583512E-4,4.766150972372612E-4,4.7237569141557635E-4,4.728230610464359E-4,4.728723210519007E-4,4.726575075034507E-4,4.723983191400422E-4,4.7256084243173105E-4,4.7278323117075816E-4,4.7242270702842405E-4,4.7242097980413494E-4,4.7284599429079965E-4,4.7246831156325494E-4,4.724690266030991E-4,4.7277169532018747E-4,4.7242287744319017E-4,4.7287797304329955E-4,4.7254109943917975E-4,4.723737526528206E-4,4.725879067254156E-4,4.7273214736675065E-4,4.724706290967905E-4,4.727236740769517E-4,4.72955769599462E-4,4.733947458895441E-4,4.725402828748749E-4,4.7239803262297297E-4,4.725683587919312E-4,4.7244600905464485E-4,4.7230242962529505E-4,4.724225607267995E-4,4.72896008864884E-4,4.726365956365902E-4,4.727247513327565E-4,4.7232593606449843E-4,4.72422680851889E-4,4.723978549832761E-4,4.7255775737411093E-4,4.7263969947988787E-4,4.7254359086778414E-4,4.724686918737655E-4,4.7239902318687205E-4,4.7336689206896966E-4,4.725178923888966E-4,4.724225725732103E-4,4.725153618805722E-4,4.7237423595538486E-4,0.9626649852058324,4.7244793422469616E-4,4.723996863746376E-4,4.723739663121246E-4,4.727518768165447E-4,4.7256210236235714E-4,4.7237376884740355E-4,4.7232574362823153E-4,4.722782460573158E-4,4.727052603526524E-4,4.7239691009696283E-4,4.7261164416194325E-4,4.7275034369828584E-4,4.7253586606683533E-4,4.724231982812578E-4,4.7232636281580725E-4,4.724471926262499E-4,4.7232610841497835E-4,4.7235089532528056E-4,4.7232637618382055E-4,4.7263298200497713E-4,4.724923113042647E-4,4.723743993447973E-4,4.724201576610027E-4]}}

{"value":"102 DALMATIANS [Walt Disney]: I wasn't a fan of the previous installment and this effort has all the weaknesses of the first, a silly padded storyline, terrible over acting by Glenn Close, who hams up every scene as though she's playing for her own amusement, and incredibly borring and uninteresting lead actors. Once more the dogs are the only \"actors\" that seem \"real\" and thats a stretch. Another wasted effort here.

{"value":"Not even the most ardent stooge fan could possibly like the movie, (I one of them) the stooges just aren't given any material to work with. It is really a shame too because this is the only feature length movie the stooges did with Curly, and this one effort by them is painfully unfunny, when it could have had great potential. Awful musical numbers don't help any either. The short they did with the same title has more laughs.","finished_norm":["not","even","the","much","ardent","stoog","fan","can","possibli","like","the","movi","i","on","of","them","the","stoog","just","be","not","give","ani","materi","to","work","with","it","be","realli","a","shame","too","becaus","thi","be","the","onli","featur","length","movi","the","stoog","do","with","curli","and","thi","on","effort","by","them","be","painfulli","unfunni","when","it","can","have","have","great","potenti","aw","music","number","do","not","help","ani","either","the","short","thei","do","with","the","same","titl","have","much","laugh"],"filtered":["even","much","ardent","stoog","fan","possibli","like","movi","stoog","give","ani","materi","work","realli","shame","becaus","thi","onli","featur","length","movi","stoog","curli","thi","effort","painfulli","unfunni","great","potenti","aw","music","number","help","ani","either","short","thei","titl","much","laugh"],"filtered2":["even","ardent","stoog","fan","possibli","like","stoog","give","ani","materi","work","realli","shame","becaus","onli","featur","length","stoog","curli","effort","painfulli","unfunni","great","potenti","aw","music","number","help","ani","either","short","titl","laugh"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,11,13,22,27,30,48,51,118,133,138,140,185,207,264,272,305,401,537,547,558,574,948,1241,1384,1651,2864,5432,8015],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,11,13,22,27,30,48,51,118,133,138,140,185,207,264,272,305,401,537,547,558,574,948,1241,1384,1651,2864,5432,8015],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2979240167361772,2.600540117735859,1.3364419891718522,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,2.354379525480895,2.3212364753796515,2.2907365189289424,2.317169775997098,2.518833027372001,2.5531798379045583,2.757740698455715,2.8028805344481915,2.8612813773965557,3.0879275592619675,3.424750734647968,3.432149042129413,3.4572130107926293,3.5039747767006686,4.049068857301474,4.3095999406873045,4.520909034354511,4.6295428753573065,18.304078229746075,6.489124940924123,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.615035986143645E-4,3.6118325199970263E-4,3.6127243093469634E-4,3.611998036200119E-4,3.6123398689697135E-4,3.6118126054421367E-4,3.6129359293063514E-4,3.611275226634617E-4,3.6118332833209063E-4,3.615565721639602E-4,3.6442541832931973E-4,3.6118392491354956E-4,3.615259889149311E-4,3.6156365368565993E-4,3.613994047584527E-4,3.612012263337601E-4,3.6132549352499964E-4,3.6149553453066125E-4,3.6121987359568784E-4,3.6121855293999095E-4,3.6154352393919425E-4,3.6125474335123076E-4,3.612552900789775E-4,3.6148671408570176E-4,3.6122000389679184E-4,3.615679752637473E-4,3.6131039780422315E-4,3.6118244251309093E-4,3.613461871974211E-4,3.6145647526244264E-4,3.6125651536421475E-4,3.614499964869211E-4,3.6162745941166203E-4,3.619631057674699E-4,3.6130977344969793E-4,3.6120100725949044E-4,3.6133124062106637E-4,3.612376905948303E-4,3.611279081001511E-4,3.6121976173177116E-4,3.615817656618294E-4,3.6138341530284095E-4,3.6145082016918667E-4,3.6114588139582763E-4,3.6121985358080594E-4,3.612008714341207E-4,3.613231346542109E-4,3.613857885373764E-4,3.613123027793909E-4,3.61255034141052E-4,3.612017646561208E-4,3.6194180841364376E-4,3.612926534247827E-4,3.612197707896741E-4,3.612907185688084E-4,3.611828120518294E-4,0.9714532152636556,3.612391626021497E-4,3.612022717371677E-4,3.6118260587946946E-4,3.614715606282701E-4,3.613264568825494E-4,3.611824548956566E-4,3.6114573425682906E-4,3.6110941706396976E-4,3.614359171400462E-4,3.612001489631015E-4,3.613643371163273E-4,3.6147038838829214E-4,3.6130639630711347E-4,3.6122024921329447E-4,3.6114620769482115E-4,3.612385955673881E-4,3.611460131770008E-4,3.611649655357105E-4,3.61146217916159E-4,3.61380652278255E-4,3.612730938311821E-4,3.611829369812666E-4,3.612179243198296E-4]}}
{"value":"The film did what it set out to do: show how a young girl copes with poverty and grows into her maturity. However, for most of us, this subject has been explored adequately and in most instances with more sophistication than done here. The movie fixated on breasts, which soon became boring and I lost interest. If this was on TV, I would've switched to the latest news on the Starr Report. That's how boring I found this movie.","finished_norm":["the","film","do","what","it","set","out","to","do","show","how","a","young","girl","cope","with","poverti","and","grow","into","her","matur","howev","for","much","of","u","thi","subject","have","be","explor","adequ","and","in","much","instanc","with","much","sophist","than","do","here","the","movi","fixat","on","breast","which","soon","becom","bore","and","i","lose","interest","if","thi","be","on","tv","i","would","have","switch","to","the","late","new","on","the","starr","report","that","how","bore","i","find","thi","movi"],"filtered":["film","set","show","young","girl","cope","poverti","grow","matur","howev","much","u","thi","subject","explor","adequ","much","instanc","much","sophist","movi","fixat","breast","soon","becom","bore","lose","interest","thi","tv","switch","late","new","starr","report","bore","find","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["set","show","young","girl","cope","poverti","grow","matur","howev","u","subject","explor","adequ","instanc","sophist","fixat","breast","soon","becom","bore","lose","interest","tv","switch","late","new","starr","report","bore","find"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[28,38,60,84,87,108,109,112,113,115,135,150,172,221,449,550,561,990,1216,1291,1579,1669,2410,2829,2937,3309,4867,5911],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[28,38,60,84,87,108,109,112,113,115,135,150,172,221,449,550,561,990,1216,1291,1579,1669,2410,2829,2937,3309,4867,5911],"values":[1.5452294193519092,1.519311641348122,1.838176641236591,2.2212694515902225,2.115024371522662,4.277015007255866,2.125691139326857,2.2466628996789315,2.1521782565202803,2.201553588425805,2.366244071437088,2.332712011146513,2.5001408943598484,2.6423424573643777,3.2597778161886266,3.4751392270607813,3.4725585804672896,4.235066888824737,4.280272325592784,4.449957298382227,4.605250182788262,4.74221603786142,5.089758498236879,5.3560264761848435,5.463272006538442,5.626901430320244,6.137727054086234,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.0972597280253476E-4,4.093628939042072E-4,4.094639687649661E-4,4.09381653409669E-4,4.0942039652719115E-4,4.0936063680070776E-4,4.094879536420343E-4,4.0929973061456783E-4,4.0936298041887E-4,4.09786012700406E-4,4.1303754543874717E-4,4.093636565806553E-4,4.09751349832573E-4,4.0979403885388956E-4,4.096078801220271E-4,4.0938326590474997E-4,4.0952410958103205E-4,4.0971683301927185E-4,4.094044005976347E-4,4.0940290377452636E-4,4.0977122392207556E-4,4.094439217657945E-4,4.0944454142368656E-4,4.0970683598077644E-4,4.0940454828011086E-4,4.097989369041238E-4,4.095070001832169E-4,4.0936197643702093E-4,4.0954756366308335E-4,4.096725634830095E-4,4.0944593015449784E-4,4.096652204783664E-4,4.0986635587440275E-4,4.1024677540598726E-4,4.0950629254360774E-4,4.0938301760730947E-4,4.0953062330464576E-4,4.094245942757448E-4,4.0930016746615973E-4,4.094042738117541E-4,4.098145668571621E-4,4.0958975777060324E-4,4.0966615403482015E-4,4.093205382898078E-4,4.0940437791288966E-4,4.093828636636642E-4,4.0952143605127374E-4,4.0959244758014435E-4,4.0950915927044797E-4,4.0944425134520357E-4,4.093838760360288E-4,4.1022263711511556E-4,4.0948688881183395E-4,4.0940428407792604E-4,4.09484695857879E-4,4.093623952699722E-4,0.9676452483700985,4.0942626263985854E-4,4.093844507585931E-4,4.0936216159547753E-4,4.0968966114458865E-4,4.0952520144460063E-4,4.0936199047134536E-4,4.0932037152336466E-4,4.092792098385827E-4,4.0964926303252945E-4,4.093820448194195E-4,4.095681346704222E-4,4.0968833253495054E-4,4.095024649108096E-4,4.0940482632033804E-4,4.0932090811509605E-4,4.094256199661198E-4,4.093206876497854E-4,4.093421681375011E-4,4.0932091969989796E-4,4.095866261753972E-4,4.094647200877981E-4,4.0936253686423403E-4,4.094021913002713E-4]}}
{"value":"What a waste! This movie could have really been something decent, but the writing, in particular, is crap, and the main characters are rather shallow and uninteresting.

Instead, the movie to watch, that deals with similar themes and the same basic time frame, is the great BOOGIE NIGHTS.","finished_norm":["what","a","wast","thi","movi","can","have","realli","be","someth","decent","but","the","write","in","particular","be","crap","and","the","main","charact","be","rather","shallow","and","uninterest","mike","meyer","be","good","and","the","histor","recreat","of","late","decad","be","good","craft","but","overal","thi","movi","be","a","big","wast","of","time","instead","the","movi","to","watch","that","deal","with","similar","theme","and","the","same","basic","time","frame","be","the","great","boogi","night"],"filtered":["wast","thi","movi","realli","someth","decent","write","particular","crap","main","charact","rather","shallow","uninterest","mike","meyer","good","histor","recreat","late","decad","good","craft","overal","thi","movi","big","wast","time","instead","movi","watch","deal","similar","theme","basic","time","frame","great","boogi","night"],"filtered2":["wast","realli","someth","decent","write","particular","crap","main","charact","rather","shallow","uninterest","mike","meyer","good","histor","recreat","late","decad","good","craft","overal","big","wast","time","instead","watch","deal","similar","theme","basic","time","frame","great","boogi","night"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,8,10,13,51,53,65,82,89,150,152,160,179,210,286,309,313,412,468,534,589,832,953,1150,1196,1247,1327,1401,2223,2866,3300,5849],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,8,10,13,51,53,65,82,89,150,152,160,179,210,286,309,313,412,468,534,589,832,953,1150,1196,1247,1327,1401,2223,2866,3300,5849],"values":[1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,1.9073850067444174,2.020196584395323,3.9880092219144876,2.332712011146513,2.3131195476980753,2.3722295531801256,2.507968722980095,2.687151791517189,2.780700890737216,2.848772527704847,2.907069060519773,3.107414446935464,3.304513710030018,3.4933926673701317,3.530930586689197,3.7987743169213135,4.1302590120314875,4.246178114249808,4.291900363587903,4.327618446189983,4.613282354485526,4.470719289830655,5.051537285416681,5.426230734858092,6.137727054086234,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.3218170169836984E-4,3.31887338698943E-4,3.319692842466372E-4,3.3190254780176046E-4,3.319339584409727E-4,3.31885508772282E-4,3.319887297731803E-4,3.3183612962158393E-4,3.3188740883993923E-4,3.3223037851353056E-4,3.348665298679644E-4,3.318879570321149E-4,3.32202275900597E-4,3.322368856463443E-4,3.3208595910411636E-4,3.3190385511785834E-4,3.3201804288033E-4,3.3217429170008083E-4,3.319209898828314E-4,3.319197763467603E-4,3.3221838864254865E-4,3.3195303131970357E-4,3.3195353370184846E-4,3.3216618668970856E-4,3.319211096150903E-4,3.322408566971681E-4,3.320041715876648E-4,3.3188659487055184E-4,3.320370580695168E-4,3.321384005658468E-4,3.319546596030476E-4,3.321324472899018E-4,3.3229551602989435E-4,3.326039377940717E-4,3.320035978751224E-4,3.3190365381290874E-4,3.3202332382402904E-4,3.3193736172841467E-4,3.3183648379514095E-4,3.3192088709230226E-4,3.322535285430904E-4,3.3207126656828906E-4,3.3213320416252404E-4,3.318529992598993E-4,3.319209714913754E-4,3.319035290044625E-4,3.320158753397697E-4,3.3207344730753905E-4,3.3200592204850484E-4,3.319532985232889E-4,3.31904349776386E-4,3.3258436788864687E-4,3.3198786647153125E-4,3.319208954155101E-4,3.3198608855354497E-4,3.3188693443565563E-4,0.9737686718248919,3.3193871433983576E-4,3.319048157276122E-4,3.3188674498612974E-4,3.3215226234346266E-4,3.320189280990428E-4,3.31886606248756E-4,3.3185286405548335E-4,3.3181949258429704E-4,3.3211950993209505E-4,3.3190286513374727E-4,3.320537358314285E-4,3.321511851849719E-4,3.320004946557495E-4,3.319213350337406E-4,3.318532990924746E-4,3.319381932977971E-4,3.318531203521776E-4,3.3187053546724564E-4,3.3185330848475007E-4,3.3206872765522615E-4,3.319698933749654E-4,3.3188704923194865E-4,3.3191919871457156E-4]}}
{"value":"This dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent. In particular, Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused badly here. I might have chuckled once or twice during this film, but in general, it's a boring movie, with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure. The premise, although routine, still wasn't bad, but once the plot was set, the film went nowhere.

Murray Abraham is good (and appears to have some fencing background), but most of the other actors--especially the students--just seem to be lost.","finished_norm":["i","would","not","sai","thi","be","a","bad","movi","unfortun","for","me","i","get","the","feel","that","the","much","you","know","about","fenc","the","wrong","it","get","simpli","due","to","the","fact","that","it","becom","total","unrealist","i","have","be","fenc","sinc","i","be","year","old","and","thi","movi","portrai","it","veri","poorli","f","murrai","abraham","be","good","and","appear","to","have","some","fenc","background","but","much","of","the","other","actorsespeci","the","studentsjust","seem","to","be","lose"],"filtered":["sai","thi","bad","movi","unfortun","get","feel","much","know","fenc","wrong","get","simpli","due","fact","becom","total","unrealist","fenc","sinc","year","old","thi","movi","portrai","veri","poorli","f","murrai","abraham","good","appear","fenc","background","much","actorsespeci","studentsjust","seem","lose"],"filtered2":["bad","unfortun","get","feel","know","fenc","wrong","get","simpli","due","fact","becom","total","unrealist","fenc","sinc","year","old","portrai","veri","poorli","f","murrai","abraham","good","appear","fenc","background","actorsespeci","studentsjust","seem","lose"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,9,15,25,26,35,43,57,67,97,115,162,170,184,201,221,227,398,469,568,801,1096,1264,3109,3514,4561],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,9,15,25,26,35,43,57,67,97,115,162,170,184,201,221,227,398,469,568,801,1096,1264,3109,3514,4561],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.463169012899134,1.6608112036218214,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,2.0545557924622586,2.201553588425805,2.3586007221245198,2.4214486257841834,2.496249838866882,2.561435818751577,2.6423424573643777,2.6005321873043625,3.143848349181566,3.328770687675578,3.4471119148061256,3.7881170224473255,4.429617614145104,4.327618446189983,5.850044981634453,18.304078229746075,6.101359409915359]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[3.965031960715055E-4,3.9615183454412095E-4,3.9624964749227084E-4,3.961699886382377E-4,3.9620748142840233E-4,3.9614965028241726E-4,3.962728583235244E-4,3.960907096756019E-4,3.961519182667614E-4,3.965612983471189E-4,3.9970789682625596E-4,3.961525726072883E-4,3.965277541278282E-4,3.9656906547861563E-4,3.9638891450684494E-4,3.9617154909448333E-4,3.963078474292223E-4,3.964943512495618E-4,3.9619200172339396E-4,3.961905532061268E-4,3.9654698683585707E-4,3.96230247454756E-4,3.962308471148971E-4,3.9648467683793597E-4,3.9619214463982515E-4,3.9657380545777567E-4,3.96291290190075E-4,3.9615094668565994E-4,3.963305445954055E-4,3.9645151039059315E-4,3.9623219102824823E-4,3.964444043611905E-4,3.966390486665686E-4,3.9700719120605555E-4,3.9629060538758424E-4,3.961713088101585E-4,3.9631415094035563E-4,3.962115437061888E-4,3.9609113242901247E-4,3.9619187902917833E-4,3.9658893099714956E-4,3.9637137700437527E-4,3.964453077896822E-4,3.961108458404612E-4,3.9619197977073655E-4,3.961711598346202E-4,3.9630526018026975E-4,3.963739800077255E-4,3.962933795987153E-4,3.962305663978978E-4,3.961721395354564E-4,3.9698383191200625E-4,3.962718278577845E-4,3.961918889640378E-4,3.9626970567537554E-4,3.9615135200193186E-4,0.9686894088221777,3.9621315822844805E-4,3.961726957104336E-4,3.961511258686376E-4,3.964680562722591E-4,3.96308904055903E-4,3.961509602670652E-4,3.9611068445594545E-4,3.960708511511146E-4,3.964289618979456E-4,3.961703674163171E-4,3.96350451730168E-4,3.96466770539836E-4,3.9628690128108723E-4,3.961924137070702E-4,3.961112037306573E-4,3.9621253629523327E-4,3.9611099038025705E-4,3.9613177764442334E-4,3.9611121494159164E-4,3.9636834647277514E-4,3.9625037456822877E-4,3.9615148902662906E-4,3.9618986372501504E-4]}}
{"value":"At least it's not full of sensless violence or fluff. It's also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline.
