{"value":"I admit, I had to fast forward through this poorly transferred DVD after about 30 minutes -- NOTHING was happening, and everyone has already described the \"plot.\" But has anyone mentioned the opening scene -- a butcher knife is stabbed through a wig and it's impaled on the grass in the front yard! I'm guessing the bratty kid did it, put it's never explained. Really trippy opening.<br /><br />I wish this had been a better written or thought out film, because what we're left with if pretty daft and a movie that makes no sense isn't a \"clever\" movie, it's just a poorly executed film.<br /><br />I would like to see a cleaned up version and if there was any missing footage, I would like to see if it would help.

{"value":"This movie was craptacular. I was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies' biggest antagonist was, in fact, myself. I played it beautifully throughout; promising myself I would walk away, but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto-magically transform into something engrossing along the way. Even in this state, I couldn't help but notice that Cuba's acting was as flimsy as tracing paper. His obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards. Burt came on the screen as a General, that's right, a General (who wears too much makeup). I fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival Cuba's, except mine was real and I stubbed my toe.

{"value":"This woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling. So she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer. This movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope. The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds, someone is snorting heroin. If they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin, then this would be a pretty good movie. Every time I thought that a scene was going somewhere, someone inhaled the white powder. It was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie. It pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer. The lesbian stuff didn't bother me. I was looking for a movie about art. I found a movie about drug use.","finished_norm":["thi","woman","who","work","a","a","intern","for","a","photograph","go","home","and","take","a","bath","where","she","discov","thi","hole","in","the","ceil","so","she","go","to","find","out","that","her","neighbor","abov","her","be","a","photograph","thi","movi","can","have","have","a","great","plot","but","then","the","plot","drain","of","ani","hope","the","problem","i","have","with","thi","movi","be","that","everi","ten","second","someon","be","snort","heroin","if","thei","take","out","the","scene","where","someon","snort","heroin","then","thi","would","be","a","pretti","good","movi","everi","time","i","think","that","a","scene","be","go","somewher","someon","inhal","the","white","powder","it","be","realli","lame","to","have","that","much","drug","us","in","on","movi","it","pull","attent","from","the","main","plot","and","a","great","stori","about","a","photograph","the","lesbian","stuff","do","not","bother","me","i","be","look","for","a","movi","about","art","i","find","a","movi","about","drug","us"],"filtered":["thi","woman","work","intern","photograph","go","home","take","bath","discov","thi","hole","ceil","go","find","neighbor","abov","photograph","thi","movi","great","plot","plot","drain","ani","hope","problem","thi","movi","everi","ten","second","someon","snort","heroin","thei","take","scene","someon","snort","heroin","thi","pretti","good","movi","everi","time","think","scene","go","somewher","someon","inhal","white","powder","realli","lame","much","drug","us","movi","pull","attent","main","plot","great","stori","photograph","lesbian","stuff","bother","look","movi","art","find","movi","drug","us"],"filtered2":["woman","work","intern","photograph","go","home","take","bath","discov","hole","ceil","go","find","neighbor","abov","photograph","great","plot","plot","drain","ani","hope","problem","everi","ten","second","someon","snort","heroin","take","scene","someon","snort","heroin","pretti","good","everi","time","think","scene","go","somewher","someon","inhal","white","powder","realli","lame","drug","us","pull","attent","main","plot","great","stori","photograph","lesbian","stuff","bother","look","art","find","drug","us"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,8,12,13,16,17,19,27,31,32,38,48,51,56,70,78,85,139,167,179,181,302,359,361,372,382,496,544,545,636,697,704,782,804,810,947,1239,1308,1313,1382,2112,2519,2875,4449,6911],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,8,12,13,16,17,19,27,31,32,38,48,51,56,70,78,85,139,167,179,181,302,359,361,372,382,496,544,545,636,697,704,782,804,810,947,1239,1308,1313,1382,2112,2519,2875,4449,6911],"values":[0.6786144649922705,2.912480743411154,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,2.62476135602347,1.3002700588679295,2.814133962290301,4.1133933855221025,3.038623282696244,1.6955116224012472,3.4279798616619646,3.7221218701403576,2.094675786251684,2.0064197866819473,4.022380438207478,6.8817107523769305,2.4609576687888097,2.507968722980095,2.4442286541160034,2.902686292364678,3.2189558216683714,3.0399731661399314,3.070535816550098,3.235085203598255,3.293679367864308,3.4222967456864013,3.442099372982581,3.530930586689197,7.590418501513635,3.5900195030592035,3.7810747398219124,3.7740817043309423,3.8425769395797067,3.9911462095687695,4.573751515728891,9.012620469866716,13.475764492443776,4.449957298382227,5.014723312293965,5.2288713006995975,5.373120909544144,5.999576715605417,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.230705802888805E-5,7.181947463258902E-5,7.237780256445875E-5,7.195960285017475E-5,7.196078182724999E-5,7.186019503476741E-5,7.20739173233459E-5,7.182981616765361E-5,7.199131577947219E-5,7.987043500623976E-5,0.23121510139433102,7.171386700763384E-5,0.7631355170383028,7.409447889394398E-5,7.176616001134394E-5,7.156782930925507E-5,7.335299928736551E-5,7.208067010536235E-5,7.185704010715466E-5,7.191659681743931E-5,7.261243207158012E-5,7.215208380960231E-5,7.223423990295445E-5,7.231206419472157E-5,7.286702213731757E-5,7.248594812517605E-5,7.55331196812967E-5,7.173518688275338E-5,7.17371059669975E-5,7.191885151929043E-5,7.344746987194759E-5,7.207649364604556E-5,7.736801020520736E-5,7.227923418658942E-5,7.181326740765918E-5,7.21447329765388E-5,7.174130871911627E-5,7.17837025542249E-5,7.156746974669413E-5,7.158603765016898E-5,7.174716912085342E-5,7.250394972721745E-5,7.213552669020024E-5,7.185032298236217E-5,7.272337974626251E-5,7.187789952894706E-5,7.426604519856922E-5,7.317394135661387E-5,7.16038306939866E-5,7.176207953869508E-5,7.173718974586248E-5,7.375614392843455E-5,7.176314722163031E-5,7.157968244584512E-5,7.236537189910586E-5,7.178163150329843E-5,7.719325567643939E-5,7.172247411181639E-5,7.160300263676244E-5,7.19448859588721E-5,7.265851876225229E-5,7.194012

Rather, it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical Shaka, but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to Sinclair's idiotic story about an African superhero who is a combination of Jesus, Lincoln, Superman, and Nelson Mandela.<br /><br />On the other hand, there are a few laugh-out-loud moments, as when Shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious slaver butt. You know, like Jesus would have done if he hadn't been such a wimp.<br /><br />True, I saw only the 98-minute version, but I can't imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been better.<br

{"value":"Although it's an R rated movie, I really doubt that you'll really enjoy it unless you're a teenager<br /><br />Why? Because there's no real plot, no character development,no funny jokes. <br /><br />The only thing that this movie has plenty of is nudity. Tons and tons of naked or almost naked chicks (pretty nice ones I might add) to feast your eyes on.<br /><br />I really can't understand why this movie has the American Pie title since it's only a bad combination between an erotic movie and a comedy without succeeding in being either of them.<br /><br />My suggestion is to watch this movie only if you want to see some naked chicks, but you're too

{"value":"With Adam Sandler.<br /><br />This is without a doubt one of the most idiotic films ever made. It's about cruise ship waiter Shecky (Sandler) wanting to be a comedian on the cruise ship. First off, there is not one funny or clever line in the entire movie honestly. It is so unfunny it's pathetic. There is surprisingly not much crude or sexual humor, but the f-word is plentiful. The budget is really low, and that also ruins the film. It takes place on a cruise ship, but it seems they only had money to rent out a small boat and only had money for 10 ship extras, one of which is Billy Bob Thornton. The opening credits are animated reeeeeaally cheaply, and it is just pathetic.

{"value":"This film is regarded by some as a classic - I've no idea why. It is terrible to the point of being laughable. The only saving grace with this movie are the delivery of cheesy lines that are so toe curlingly embarrassing that you have no choice but to laugh at them.<br /><br />There are a couple of good songs and good choreography in this film, but SO WHAT! There is no plot, it is set in a theatre with no change of scenery, and Michael Douglas is as depressing as ever. My brother once forced me to watch this film, because he said I wouldn't believe how bad a film can get! He was right.<br /><br />Normally with a film this dreadful I would recommend that people shouldn't watch it, but in this case I think people should, as it will put every other bad film you've seen in

{"value":"This film is beautiful to look at, but is like watching really bad experimental theater. The plot (if there was one) doesn't make any sense. But it is very \"artistic\". Lots of shots of half-dressed actors wrestling and looking deep into each other's eyes. Lots of arty shots through windows and with people out of frame. Mumbling and people wandering wistfully. Lingering close-ups of faces and bodies. By the time you get to the threesome on the roof with the cat, you'll be ready to throw a bottle of KY at the screen.<br /><br />It is supposed to be about a father and son's relationship, but you will just be wishing the two of them would just f*$& each other and get it over with. If you have always wanted to see bad Russian gay porn without any money shots, your wish has been

What we saw was 2 hours of brutal police oppression, with no uplift at the end. The previews and ads made NO mention of this! Plus, for all that they played up whoopi goldberg, my recollection is that she is arrested and killed in the first 20 minutes! Again, the previews say nothing about this! (not that you would expect that, but it's just more of the problem). If I had known how depressing this movie would be, I would've never have seen it. Or at least, I would've been prepared for it. This was a bait and switch ad campaign, and I will NEVER see this movie again!","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","aw","movi","not","for","the","subject","matt","but","for","the","deliveri","i","go","with","my","girlfriend","at","the","time","when","the","movi","come","out","expect","to","see","a","movi","about","the","triumph","of","the","human","spirit","over","oppress","what","we","see","be","hour","of","brutal","polic","oppress","with","no","uplift","at","the","end","the","preview","and","ad","make","no","mention","of","thi","plu","for","all","that","thei","plai","up","whoopi","goldberg","my","recollect","be","that","she","be","arrest","and","kill","in","the","minut","again","the","preview","sai","noth","about","thi","not","that","you","would","expect","that","but","it","just","much","of","the","problem","if","i","have","know","how","depress","thi","movi","would","be","i","would","have","never","have","see","it","or","at","littl","i","would","have","be","prepar","for","it","thi","be","a","bait","and","switch","ad","campaign","and","i","will","never","see","thi","movi","again"],"filtered":["thi","aw","movi","subject","matt","deliveri","go","girlfriend","time","movi","come","expect","see","movi","triumph","human","spirit","oppress","see","hour","brutal","polic","oppress","uplift","end","preview","ad","make","mention","thi","plu","thei","plai","whoopi","goldberg","recollect","arrest","kill","minut","preview","sai","noth","thi","expect","much","problem","know","depress","thi","movi","never","see","littl","prepar","thi","bait","switch","ad","campaign","never","see","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["aw","subject","matt","deliveri","go","girlfriend","time","come","expect","see","triumph","human","spirit","oppress","see","hour","brutal","polic","oppress","uplift","end","preview","ad","make","mention","plu","plai","whoopi","goldberg","recollect","arrest","kill","minut","preview","noth","expect","problem","know","depress","never","see","littl","prepar","bait","switch","ad","campaign","never","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,8,14,24,26,34,40,42,49,59,76,130,138,167,174,285,292,408,471,550,730,749,894,1075,1191,1295,1579,1832,1974,1994,2113,3160,3754,3794,3853,4108,4279,5594,7389],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,8,14,24,26,34,40,42,49,59,76,130,138,167,174,285,292,408,471,550,730,749,894,1075,1191,1295,1579,1832,1974,1994,2113,3160,3754,3794,3853,4108,4279,5594,7389],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.6228008218775787,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.1175081997259209,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,3.2439908614907673,1.6920303308087352,1.8693254449200722,2.1337665533324026,4.528427806839927,2.2907365189289424,2.4609576687888097,2.456282578459816,2.808171552082607,2.9752256367457734,3.130944944345658,3.496027715008137,3.4751392270607813,3.767137231978131,3.7165362186843414,4.091229668125752,4.202455303235976,4.3215761317340196,4.358390104856736,4.605250182788262,9.617182213612585,9.981825327200493,5.051537285416681,5.00274712124725,5.626901430320244,11.700089963268907,5.770002273960917,6.032366538428407,5.822646007446338,6.1754673820690815,6.2980697041614135,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.611823182487334E-5,7.560494879268829E-5,7.619270517651713E-5,7.575246291429914E-5,7.575370403311625E-5,7.564781549336055E-5,7.587280269587764E-5,7.56158354112969E-5,7.578584737454291E-5,8.408026067565247E-5,9.792345477072197E-5,7.549377478149286E-5,7.69028286506474E-5,7.799986439967105E-5,7.554882405452003E-5,7.534003970108168E-5,7.72193027487682E-5,7.58799114047783E-5,7.564449427523933E-5,7.570719011163143E-5,7.643970157912123E-5,7.595508919575742E-5,7.604157558768206E-5,7.612350185662207E-5,7.670771062515889E-5,7.630655089346253E-5,7.951433333188348E-5,7.551621838853572E-5,7.551823862422734E-5,7.570956365472499E-5,7.73187527064055E-5,7.587551481187092E-5,0.9567658286376295,7.608894143834565E-5,7.55984143961981E-5,7.594735091362442E-5,7.552266289578255E-5,7.556729123299766E-5,7.533966118663072E-5,7.535920777059818E-5,7.5528832188659E-5,7.632550132727575E-5,7.593765938064178E-5,7.563742310299018E-5,7.655649710437314E-5,7.566645315929589E-5,7.818047365283112E-5,7.703080699946542E-5,7.537793865346219E-5,7.554452850756365E-5,7.551832681892422E-5,7.764369641218607E-5,7.55456524661286E-5,7.53525175949887E-5,7.617961931335436E-5,7.556511102073567E-5,8.126197208228875E-5,7.550283555051552E-5,7.53770669508446E-5,7.573697032236617E-5,7.648821741561431E-5,7.573195989098031E-5,7.536312202494389E-5,7.553859351216611E-5,7.534057243316912E-5,7.708379712152159E-5,7.598959609826428E-5,7.582772713271902E-5,7.576141235827115E-5,0.03726967837478996,7.533782388960046E-5,7.576300066079118E-5,7.699182623665003E-5,7.547283345471883E-5,7.734074675888246E-5,7.567237595872581E-5,7.626462591746867E-5,7.57985300738162E-5,7.531420326293755E-5,7.

{"value":"For two of the funniest comedians, the movie was awful. Fast forwarded it and never got any better! Waste of time and waste of money! Tina Fey is such a great writer, I thought that she would be so great in the comedy. The previews were so great, but they only showed the best parts of the movie. My husband even thought that for a chick flick, it sucked. What is up with that. Movie was very slow ans boring. I will not recommend it to anyone at this time. I would like my money back for this one! BOO from us here in Arizona. Thanks but no thanks. Who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant. I thought that it was going to be so funny, I have had my own children and I have helped others have children. It could have been more along the lines of reality.","finished_norm":["for","two","of","the","funni","comedian","the","movi","be","aw","fast","forward","it","and","never","get","ani","well","wast","of","time","and","wast","of","monei","tina","fei","be","such","a","great","writer","i","think","that","she","would","be","so","great","in","the","comedi","the","preview","be","so","great","but","thei","onli","show","the","well","part","of","the","movi","my","husband","even","think","that","for","a","chick","flick","it","suck","what","be","up","with","that","movi","be","veri","slow","an","bore","i","will","not","recommend","it","to","anyon","at","thi","time","i","would","like","my","monei","back","for","thi","on","boo","from","u","here","in","arizona","thank","but","no","thank","who","doe","thi","kind","of","stupid","stuff","to","make","peopl","think","that","you","be","pregnant","i","think","that","it","be","go","to","be","so","funni","i","have","have","my","own","child","and","i","have","help","other","have","child","it","can","have","be","much","along","the","line","of","realiti"],"filtered":["two","funni","comedian","movi","aw","fast","forward","never","get","ani","well","wast","time","wast","monei","tina","fei","great","writer","think","great","comedi","preview","great","thei","onli","show","well","part","movi","husband","even","think","chick","flick","suck","movi","veri","slow","bore","recommend","anyon","thi","time","like","monei","back","thi","boo","u","arizona","thank","thank","doe","thi","kind","stupid","stuff","make","peopl","think","pregnant","think","go","funni","child","help","child","much","along","line","realiti"],"filtered2":["two","funni","comedian","aw","fast","forward","never","get","ani","well","wast","time","wast","monei","tina","fei","great","writer","think","great","comedi","preview","great","onli","show","well","part","husband","even","think","chick","flick","suck","veri","slow","bore","recommend","anyon","time","like","monei","back","boo","u","arizona","thank","thank","doe","kind","stupid","stuff","make","peopl","think","pregnant","think","go","funni","child","help","child","along","line","realiti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,6,8,11,12,15,18,20,23,27,28,42,47,51,61,62,63,89,107,108,112,122,126,127,136,138,158,180,185,257,287,298,324,361,390,421,536,542,651,656,699,1042,1634,1812,1974,4646,4897,7470,7697],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,6,8,11,12,15,18,20,23,27,28,42,47,51,61,62,63,89,107,108,112,122,126,127,136,138,158,180,185,257,287,298,324,361,390,421,536,542,651,656,699,1042,1634,1812,1974,4646,4897,7470,7697],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,0.9913098153388195,4.266914441051552,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,1.364847727375781,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.6219954307453837,1.7064694353107215,5.141969792492947,1.8818517047392527,4.045224089013853,1.8729627573220065,3.9880092219144876,2.1439533986393955,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,2.2489347673732487,4.478254137980457,2.4359679371086367,2.346825985579986,2.2907365189289424,2.3106972614914807,5.419462958538709,2.518833027372001,2.7602659523229094,2.841890188081905,2.7819920465008363,2.8753661172782943,3.0399731661399314,3.132778125427319,3.2597778161886266,3.6254214301101193,3.4471119148061256,7.094919777280815,3.68099128126493,3.5813614403160887,4.176068548062782,4.828393734102471,4.869215728622727,4.9909126636002465,6.0662680901040895,6.437831646536572,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.759544883418296E-5,7.707220458235898E-5,7.767136748085202E-5,7.722258149208688E-5,7.72238466971417E-5,7.711590319173234E-5,7.73452566927625E-5,7.708330247621398E-5,7.725661384037711E-5,8.571199578351758E-5,0.9210254378821239,7.695887303102641E-5,7.839527223247056E-5,7.951359801713254E-5,7.701499063841339E-5,7.680215443312848E-5,7.871788810385044E-5,7.735250335948814E-5,7.711251751914623E-5,7.717643008579744E-5,7.792315731176387E-5,7.742914011645863E-5,7.751730493897949E-5,7.760082114077903E-5,7.819636757585355E-5,7.778742258739407E-5,8.105745805858517E-5,7.698175219834541E-5,7.698381164049856E-5,7.71788496919451E-5,7.881926807438313E-5,7.734802144245182E-5,8.302654873445741E-5,7.75655900127856E-5,7.7065543373653E-5,7.742125165845166E-5,7.698832177333876E-5,7.70338162071151E-5,7.680176857289489E-5,7.682169449497383E-5,7.699461079291083E-5,7.780674078990727E-5,7.741137204309999E-5,7.710530911754123E-5,0.07291164324781865,7.713490255652054E-5,7.969771233149032E-5,7.852573424110522E-5,7.684078888573999E-5,7.701061172831423E-5,7.69839015467789E-5,7.915051792203982E-5,7.701175749940254E-5,7.681487448396266E-5,7.765802766197875E-5,7.70315936837463E-5,8.28390130157

{"value":"Sondra Locke stinks in this film, but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway. Unfortunately, she drags everyone else (including then =real life boyfriend Clint Eastwood down the drain with her. But what was Clint Eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one? One read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer. It's an exceptionally weak story, basically no story or plot at all. Add in bored, poor acting, even from the normally good Eastwood. There's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as I was concerned, this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers. Wow! Could a film BE any more boring? I think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun. A real stinker. Don't bother with this

{"value":"Sondra Locke stinks in this film, but then she was an awful 'actress' anyway. Unfortunately, she drags everyone else (including then =real life boyfriend Clint Eastwood down the drain with her. But what was Clint Eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one? One read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer. It's an exceptionally weak story, basically no story or plot at all. Add in bored, poor acting, even from the normally good Eastwood. There's absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as I was concerned, this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers. Wow! Could a film BE any more boring? I think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun. A real stinker.

{"value":"It's not just the plot alone that makes this movie an instant turn-off for bored audiences. It's the terrible direction with a horrible script and mistakes left and right that makes this too agonizing to watch. I'm sorry but I do not see the 'fun' in this. Just the thrill of pointing the many mistakes and stupid one-liners. Well I'm wondering how dumb the directors think of their producing company when this movie was first introduced. Probably as dumb as that sheriff who dove into the pickup truck full of antifreeze with a gaping bloody wound. Oops! Did I forget to mention this sheriff's not only a poor actor but also can shrug off an impalement with a load of antifreeze drenching the exposed flesh?

{"value":"Hmm, Hip Hop music to a period western. Modern phrases like \"cool\" and too many others to keep track of. \"The sistahs are in tha house\"!?French manicured nails on hard riding girls. Microphone packs CLEARLY visible on Li'l Kim's back. I just can't go on with the litany of errors made by the director and editors.<br /><br />The acting isn't as bad as I've ever seen. The women did well enough with a poor script.<br /><br />It was weird hearing Louis Mandylor speaking in his native accent.<br /><br />The girls are beautiful. The costumes fabulous albeit completely incorrect. I just can't believe they would dumb down what could have been a great story.

{"value":"I gave this film 2 stars only because Dominic Monaghan actually put effort through in his acting. Everything else about this film is extremely amateur. Everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed. Not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films. As Dominic Monaghan is a very credible actor, placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful. Whomever the \"actor\" was that played Jack's best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera. I didn't expect much from such a small film, but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their surroundings.

{"value":"A cast of 1980's TV movie and TV series guest stars (Misty Rowe, Pamela Hemsley,Clevon Little, Seymour Cassel among several others)in the story of a photographer who has dreams about killing his models. Of course the models and other people start turning up dead causing all sorts of complications.<br /><br />Over done not very good thriller has enough nudity and violence to get an R rating but not enough good material to engender any real interest. This is best described as the sort of movie that gave the cable channel Cinemax the alternate name of Skinamax. I really can't see the point of watching this unless you need to see every sleazy thriller out there.

{"value":"Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this god awful movie that powered on Adam Sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time.<br /><br />Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails...or so I thought. Sandler encounters babes that like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. The babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler fared bad in Going Overboard, but fared better in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone's favorite, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard ain't Dooley squat!

{"value":"Some moron who read or saw some reference to angels coming to Earth, decided to disregard what he'd heard about the offspring of humans and angels being larger than normal humans. Reinventing them as mythical giants that were 40 feet tall, is beyond ridiculous. There was some historical references to housing and furniture in parts of the world, that were much larger than would be needed for standard humans. These were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a 10 to 14 foot human, somewhat supporting the \"David and Goliath\" tale from the bible. There is no mention in any historical references to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of a 40 foot tall being. If I was rating this movie on my own scale, it would have been a negative value instead of a

{"value":"It's hard to say what was the worst thing about this show: the bad acting, poor acoustics of different portions, bad CGI, improper sets for the period, the poor script.

{"value":"I'm 47 years old and I've spent as much of my life as I can remember, a fan of horror and sci-fi films. Be they silent, black and white, no budget or big budget, there are very few of them that I can't find something to like about. That said, I'll give this movie credit for good gore and creature effects but that's all. This is a case of effects over story. Truth is we live in a time where there is very little left that hasn't been seen in a horror film. Therefor for a film of any kind to really entertain it must have a good, original story. A good story can overcome poor effects and bad acting but a bad story with good acting and good effects is still a bad movie. This movie doesn't even have good acting, only good effects. So unless you can only about the gore, pass this one

{"value":"I discovered this movie on IFC, and I thought it would be interesting. For \"tiny\" love stories, some of the stories really dragged on in this movie. The fact that none of these women had names almost makes you suspect that the actresses were talking about their own real sex lives, including Kathy Baker and Alicia Witt. I have to admit, I want to start seeing some more romantic views of first sexual encounters again, like in \"Strike!(1998),\" when Odette Sinclair's acquaintances started asking about her presumed first time, and Tweety asked \"Was it beautiful?\"<br /><br />Some might think re-enactments and flashbacks would improve this movie. I think it would make things even worse. It doesn't necessarily have to be hardcore porn to get my attention, but somehow I just expected more.","finished_norm":["i","discov","thi","movi","on","ifc","and","i","think","it","would","be","interest","for","tini","love","stori","some","of","the","stori","realli","drag","on","in","thi","movi","the","fact","that","none","of","thi","woman","have","name","almost","make","you","suspect","that","the","actress","be","talk","about","their","own","real","sex","live","includ","kathi","baker","and","alicia","witt","i","have","to","admit","i","want","to","start","see","some","much","romant","view","of","sexual","encount","again","like","in","strike","when","odett","sinclair","acquaint","start","ask","about","her","presum","time","and","tweeti","ask","be","it","beautifulbr","br","some","mai","think","reenact","and","flashback","would","improv","thi","movi","i","think","it","would","make","thing","even","wrong","it","doe","not","necessarili","have","to","be","hardcor","porn","to","get","my","attent","but","somehow","i","just","expect","much"],"filtered":["discov","thi","movi","ifc","think","interest","tini","love","stori","stori","realli","drag","thi","movi","fact","none","thi","woman","name","almost","make","suspect","actress","talk","real","sex","live","includ","kathi","baker","alicia","witt","admit","want","start","see","much","romant","view","sexual","encount","like","strike","odett","sinclair","acquaint","start","ask","presum","time","tweeti","ask","beautifulbr","br","mai","think","reenact","flashback","improv","thi","movi","think","make","thing","even","wrong","doe","necessarili","hardcor","porn","get","attent","somehow","expect","much"],"filtered2":["discov","ifc","think","interest","tini","love","stori","stori","realli","drag","fact","none","woman","name","almost","make","suspect","actress","talk","real","sex","live","includ","kathi","baker","alicia","witt","admit","want","start","see","romant","view","sexual","encount","like","strike","odett","sinclair","acquaint","start","ask","presum","time","tweeti","ask","beautifulbr","mai","think","reenact","flashback","improv","think","make","thing","even","wrong","doe","necessarili","hardcor","porn","get","attent","somehow","expect"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,8,12,13,17,18,25,29,37,46,54,60,70,71,80,97,116,130,131,143,186,254,301,306,312,354,370,519,549,636,691,764,782,864,971,977,1051,1056,1116,1288,1607,1889,2267,2554,2570,4556,4649,4658,5262],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,8,12,13,17,18,25,29,37,46,54,60,70,71,80,97,116,130,131,143,186,254,301,306,312,354,370,519,549,636,691,764,782,864,971,977,1051,1056,1116,1288,1607,1889,2267,2554,2570,4556,4649,4658,5262],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,3.200185830788664,1.1317941569733974,2.5541073880211935,1.2153159934048174,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.4876543214774305,1.655771293751733,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,2.094675786251684,3.8429853485101932,1.9951803900462557,2.0545557924622586,2.2466628996789315,2.2642139034199635,2.2512118082053005,2.3409902041158843,2.571852579609833,2.889652074525771,2.8309760279012264,5.747897365194643,2.8824835850471584,3.0316467233633775,2.9958122703541616,3.5614461306151473,3.4471119148061256,3.530930586689197,3.5929222627171646,3.7465885637507435,3.7810747398219124,3.9782428047328615,4.181290492043933,4.035401218572811,4.191816905030921,4.100845126825194,4.181290492043933,4.403125998698128,4.597282013139085,4.838444069955973,5.051537285416681,5.501738287366237,5.2288713006995975,6.101359409915359,6.214688095222362,6.437831646536572,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.416433238757833E-5,7.366422495608336E-5,7.423689406265818E-5,7.380795249789201E-5,7.380916175809521E-5,7.37059912998462E-5,7.392520324513704E-5,7.367483212314059E-5,7.384048000341519E-5,8.192198177080684E-5,0.768295526344668,7.355590470058758E-5,7.492878918566613E-5,7.599766482795422E-5,7.360954089896743E-5,7.340611588744913E-5,0.17908938066341362,7.393212947867027E-5,7.370275533496934E-5,7.376384181501527E-5,7.44775502479386E-5,7.400537751064198E-5,7.408964386002931E-5,7.416946714145973E-5,7.473867969743693E-5,7.434781744316792E-5,7.747325844838512E-5,7.357777219662364E-5,7.357974057434003E-5,7.376615443099052E-5,7.533403677457757E-5,7.392784574309287E-5,7.935527985016529E-5,7.413579386388802E-5,7.365785829278036E-5,7.399783786456164E-5,7.358405127807457E-5,7.362753403845634E-5,7.340574708918777E-5,7.342479192661567E-5,7.359006220970706E-5,7.436628143318081E-5,7.398839510615492E-5,7.36958656745492E-5,7.45913477173293E-5,7.372415055050427E-5,7.617363797344785E-5,7.505348242370652E-5,7.34430420013919E-5,7.360535561556525E-5,7.357982650514344E-5,7.565063941267101E-5,7.360645072293444E-5,7.341827348292962E-5,7.422414

{"value":"There's no getting around it-- this movie is terrible. I've seen the old Christopher Lee/Fu Manchu movies, I'm familiar with the characters and it's serial origins, but it's still just godawful. However, Peter Sellers' genius still shines through with his portrayal of Nayland Smith, with echoes of sadness, tragedy, and strength simmering through a stoic facade; it's a performance I place on par with Peter Cushing's portrayal of Van Helsing but done in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of all Cushing's \"Dracula\" movies. If the movie was done in a more serio-comic vein like BUBBA HO-TEP by way of the 1960's AVENGERS TV show, this could've been something special. If you're a Fu Manchu or Peter Sellers completest, this is something you need to see, but it's a pass for anyone else.","finished_norm":["there","no","get","around","it","thi","movi","be","terribl","i","have","see","the","old","christoph","leefu","manchu","movi","i","be","familiar","with","the","charact","and","it","serial","origin","but","it","still","just","godaw","howev","peter","seller","geniu","still","shine","through","with","hi","portray","of","nayland","smith","with","echo","of","sad","tragedi","and","strength","simmer","through","a","stoic","facad","it","a","perform","i","place","on","par","with","peter","cush","portray","of","van","hels","but","do","in","a","of","the","cumul","screen","time","of","all","cush","dracula","movi","if","the","movi","be","do","in","a","much","seriocom","vein","like","bubba","hotep","by","wai","of","the","aveng","tv","show","thi","can","have","be","someth","special","if","you","re","a","fu","manchu","or","peter","seller","complet","thi","be","someth","you","ne","to","see","but","it","a","pass","for","anyon","els"],"filtered":["get","around","thi","movi","terribl","see","old","christoph","leefu","manchu","movi","familiar","charact","serial","origin","still","godaw","howev","peter","seller","geniu","still","shine","hi","portray","nayland","smith","echo","sad","tragedi","strength","simmer","stoic","facad","perform","place","par","peter","cush","portray","van","hels","cumul","screen","time","cush","dracula","movi","movi","much","seriocom","vein","like","bubba","hotep","wai","aveng","tv","show","thi","someth","special","re","fu","manchu","peter","seller","complet","thi","someth","ne","see","pass","anyon","els"],"filtered2":["get","around","terribl","see","old","christoph","leefu","manchu","familiar","charact","serial","origin","still","godaw","howev","peter","seller","geniu","still","shine","portray","nayland","smith","echo","sad","tragedi","strength","simmer","stoic","facad","perform","place","par","peter","cush","portray","van","hels","cumul","screen","time","cush","dracula","seriocom","vein","like","bubba","hotep","wai","aveng","tv","show","someth","special","re","fu","manchu","peter","seller","complet","someth","ne","see","pass","anyon","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,8,10,28,33,53,64,67,68,69,98,103,105,110,113,158,164,166,172,192,196,203,455,487,760,818,1095,1133,1162,1341,1423,1528,1707,1880,2139,2146,2221,2231,2429,2963,3083,3611,3649,5416,6354,6824],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,8,10,28,33,53,64,67,68,69,98,103,105,110,113,158,164,166,172,192,196,203,455,487,760,818,1095,1133,1162,1341,1423,1528,1707,1880,2139,2146,2221,2231,2429,2963,3083,3611,3649,5416,6354,6824],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,3.400636547121535,3.766857155204268,1.9570915389266579,2.0064197866819473,2.127032521151058,2.0881990796736947,2.098582041218749,2.1765612129984904,2.1290479736304078,2.1521782565202803,2.3106972614914807,2.3930275298746078,2.4423870329693536,2.5001408943598484,2.5318267134339894,2.478925055209576,2.569760528637609,3.2787058260741455,3.3220965805878846,11.550202833926592,4.202455303235976,4.1554492608600455,4.403125998698128,4.383707912841026,4.449957298382227,8.96960805942479,4.848596441419991,4.706176101378222,4.911775343041523,4.956227105612356,5.626901430320244,5.02684467282631,11.935656034581672,5.541743621979936,5.501738287366237,5.463272006538442,5.695894301807195,5.672363804397,13.321950395701563,7.0356686472921925,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.32369913634537E-5,6.281056954708819E-5,0.03084995489945952,6.293312033433922E-5,6.29341514226611E-5,6.284618205561872E-5,6.303309540661713E-5,6.281961385868643E-5,6.296085525110614E-5,6.985163200343454E-5,0.26844029365371613,6.27182091517235E-5,6.388881342376402E-5,6.480020138592816E-5,6.276394261556688E-5,6.259049015826885E-5,6.41517316409878E-5,6.303900113186297E-5,6.284342287642324E-5,6.289550890061747E-5,6.35040598381886E-5,6.310145683012206E-5,6.317330741161977E-5,6.324136956489363E-5,6.37267145862469E-5,6.339344180940398E-5,6.605838167323276E-5,6.273685470024334E-5,6.27385330580286E-5,6.289748077674372E-5,6.423435200619379E-5,6.303534856005398E-5,6.766310684635573E-5,6.321265769364192E-5,6.28051409452341E-5,6.309502807227154E-5,6.274220862451797E-5,6.277928465357669E-5,6.259017569858564E-5,6.260641447780977E-5,6.274733390805378E-5,6.340918532302288E-5,6.308697660585108E-5,6.283754833562365E-5,0.2798958199852859,6.286166573004904E-5,6.495024672340422E-5,0.032246495558691614,6.262197559437152E-5,6.276037399003171E-5,6.273860632782417E-5,6.450430654695784E-5,6.276130774474935E-5,6.260085645882938E-5,6.328799044719266E-5,6.277747339153504E-5,0.12852433766189233,6.272573659631459E-5,6.262125140714885E-5,6.292024950328105E-5,6.35443654976837E-5,6.291

{"value":"Holy cow, what a piece of sh*t this movie is. I didn't how these filmmakers could take a 250 word book and turn it into a movie. I guess they didn't know either! I don't remember any farting or belching in the book, do you?<br /><br />They took this all times childrens classic, added some farting, belching and sexual inuindo, and prostituted it into a KAKA joke. This should give you a good idea of what these hollywood producers think like. I have to say, visually it was interesting, but the brilliant visual story is ruined by toilet humor (if you even think that kind of thing is funny) I DON'T want the kids that I know to think it is.<br /><br />Don't take your kids to see, don't rent the DVD.

{"value":"!!!! POSSIBLE MILD SPOILER !!!!!<br /><br />As I watched the first half of GUILTY AS SIN I couldn`t believe it was made in 1993 because it played like a JAGGED EDGE / Joe Eszterhas clone from the mid 80s . It starts with a murder and it`s left for the audience to muse \" Is he guilty or innocent and will he go to bed with his attorney ? \" , but halfway through the film shows its early 90s credentials by turning into a \" Lawyer gets manipulated and stalked by her client \" type film which ends in a ridiculous manner , and GUILTY AS SIN has an even more ridiculous ending in this respect .<br /><br />This is a very poor thriller but the most unforgivable thing about it is that it was directed by Sidney Lumet the same man who brought us the all time classic court room drama 12 ANGRY

{"value":"Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller's film is incomprehensible.<br /><br />This new film is a mess. There was one other person in the audience when I saw it, and she left about an hour into it. (I hope she demanded a refund.) The only reason I stayed through to the end was because I've never walked out of a movie.<br /><br />But I sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that Madonna and Ritchie could actually think they made a good film. The dialogue is laughable, the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery. Ritchie took Lina's movie and turned it into another \"Blue Lagoon.\"<br /><br />This is a film that you wouldn't even waste time watching late night on Cinemax.

{"value":"My husband and I went to see this movie, being the horror movie buffs that we are. Two hours later I found myself wanting both my money and time back. I was so disappointed. The teasers for this film basically contained the best points of the film. There was nothing very scary about the film other than good timing on surprise entrances, etc. I found most of the 'scary' parts to be more comical than anything. After viewing other movies based on the works of Japanese writers, I have to conclude that what is deemed frightening in Japan is not what is frightening here in the US. My advice: If you are a fan of true horror movies, save yourself the pain of sitting through this one. I can't really say that I would recommend renting it either, unless you have a free rental coming to you.","finished_norm":["my","husband","and","i","go","to","see","thi","movi","be","the","horror","movi","buff","that","we","be","two","hour","late","i","find","myself","want","both","my","monei","and","time","back","i","be","so","disappoint","the","teaser","for","thi","film","basic","contain","the","well","point","of","the","film","there","be","noth","veri","scari","about","the","film","other","than","good","time","on","surpris","entranc","etc","i","find","much","of","the","scari","part","to","be","much","comic","than","anyth","after","view","other","movi","base","on","the","work","of","japanes","writer","i","have","to","conclud","that","what","be","deem","frighten","in","japan","be","not","what","be","frighten","here","in","the","u","my","advic","if","you","be","a","fan","of","true","horror","movi","save","yourself","the","pain","of","sit","through","thi","on","i","ca","not","realli","sai","that","i","would","recommend","rent","it","either","unless","you","have","a","free","rental","come","to","you"],"filtered":["husband","go","see","thi","movi","horror","movi","buff","two","hour","late","find","want","monei","time","back","disappoint","teaser","thi","film","basic","contain","well","point","film","noth","veri","scari","film","good","time","surpris","entranc","etc","find","much","scari","part","much","comic","anyth","view","movi","base","work","japanes","writer","conclud","deem","frighten","japan","frighten","u","advic","fan","true","horror","movi","save","pain","sit","thi","ca","realli","sai","recommend","rent","either","unless","free","rental","come"],"filtered2":["husband","go","see","horror","buff","two","hour","late","find","want","monei","time","back","disappoint","teaser","basic","contain","well","point","noth","veri","scari","good","time","surpris","entranc","etc","find","scari","part","comic","anyth","view","base","work","japanes","writer","conclud","deem","frighten","japan","frighten","u","advic","fan","true","horror","save","pain","sit","ca","realli","recommend","rent","either","unless","free","rental","come"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,8,13,15,20,34,37,38,47,48,49,61,63,66,81,83,104,112,126,140,150,174,187,189,207,244,286,287,298,304,312,326,334,396,429,459,460,480,536,661,686,711,843,1283,1504,1708,1841,2331,2347,5174,5823,8320],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,8,13,15,20,34,37,38,47,48,49,61,63,66,81,83,104,112,126,140,150,174,187,189,207,244,286,287,298,304,312,326,334,396,429,459,460,480,536,661,686,711,843,1283,1504,1708,1841,2331,2347,5174,5823,8320],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,3.038623282696244,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,1.929723173391612,1.949757232424728,4.584637595480144,2.0728240170322856,2.2466628996789315,2.2391270689902285,2.317169775997098,2.332712011146513,2.456282578459816,2.4732161909892554,2.498193474075453,2.5531798379045583,2.634508058031767,2.780700890737216,2.841890188081905,2.7819920465008363,2.871119826396843,2.8824835850471584,2.942840385588056,2.942840385588056,6.583053029006414,3.2872346624216657,3.2829611516442836,3.216957819005698,3.43462735814388,3.6254214301101193,3.5727776966246974,3.6016814428070463,3.6375061693251913,4.339813719283801,4.3773181147422555,4.535724120139652,9.377263583454626,5.156897801074508,5.089758498236879,5.064116067623542,6.1754673820690815,6.342521466732247,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.381794869854915E-5,7.33201770132472E-5,7.389017147513307E-5,7.34632332771714E-5,7.346443688953827E-5,7.336174828776631E-5,7.357993640610631E-5,7.333073463964872E-5,7.349560886334203E-5,8.153936606666943E-5,0.9396588557806484,7.321236266629919E-5,7.457883510966923E-5,7.56427185801657E-5,7.326574835741142E-5,7.306327344014547E-5,7.488574540145384E-5,7.358683029074291E-5,7.335852743642739E-5,7.34193286127481E-5,7.412970367837846E-5,7.365973621859648E-5,7.374360900293683E-5,7.382305947061967E-5,7.438961352568904E-5,7.400057678922864E-5,7.711142045701452E-5,7.323412803043838E-5,7.323608721486855E-5,7.34216304276762E-5,7.498218999422674E-5,7.358256656230486E-5,7.898465189878299E-5,7.378954346371611E-5,7.331384008537428E-5,7.365223178634926E-5,7.324037778550927E-5,7.328365746014261E-5,7.306290636435229E-5,7.308186225307893E-5,7.324636064315246E-5,7.401895454338166E-5,7.364283313024057E-5,7.335166995408956E-5,7.424296965795483E-5,7.337982272584628E-5,7.581786984504175E-5,7.470294596932909E-5,7.310002709108404E-5,7.32615826213288E-5,7.32361727443331E-5,7.529731394322247E-5,7.326267261401122E-5,7.307537425371157E-5,7.387748106506353E-5,7.328154313361335E-

Rider Haggard, the only similarity it bears to anything Haggard actually wrote is that it takes place in Africa (albeit an Africa that has dinosaurs - which our intrepid adventurers use to pull their canoes!), and has some characters with the same names.<br /><br />Our heroes (David McCallum, Patrick McNee and John Colico) set out to seek treasure, armed only with a medallion, and end up precisely where the treasure is, purely by chance. On the way, they meet a motley assortment of extremely lame monsters, pick up a French chef, and McCallum has an affair with the Queen of Phoenicia.<br /><br />It's so ridiculous, it's a hoot. That's the only reason I didn't give it a

{"value":"This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Not just the story, but the acting is shockingly bad. The dialog sounds like someone reading the news.<br /><br />This is rated as comedy/drama/romance, it's not of those things ! It's a little action, that's it. There's really NO comedy and drama at all.<br /><br />If you went to the cinema to see this I feel sorry for you. I would not recommend it at all. Pretty much anything else that you choose to look at will be better. This is pretty much a action/crime movie. The actions scenes sucked, and crime story part of it was very predictable.<br /><br />If you are not really interested in a good story, or good acting.

{"value":"One wonders why this picture was made at all : the plot as such is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous, the characters (experienced loner cop versus younger one, quite fascinated) quite predictable, the ending totally murky and impossible to understand (maybe after several viewings but you'd have to have a masochistic tendency for that ; the idea being you have to read the book to understand fully what it's all about)and the acting is bad. Was the basic idea to show that French film makers are able to do as well as Americans in the genre that include \"Seven\" and \"Silence of the lambs\" ? If so, it is a total failure. It was quite a success though (and has a sort of cult-status as the first French serial killer film)and, it seems, considered as a good product to export.

{"value":"Well, what can i say about this movie. I'm speechless. I could go on about how stupid this movie is forever though the one thing that REALLY pi*sed me off was the music. And to top it all off someone commented on how much they LIKED it. To them all I have to say is that it was ripped off from one of the best martial arts movies of all time Fistsof fury starring Bruce Lee. IF he was still alive and ever came across this movie he'd be horrified. the rest of the movie is absolutely ridiculous and a waste of tape. I say tape because a movie like that couldn't possibly have been shot on film.I now feel more stupid for wasting 30 minutes of my life watching it.

{"value":"I went in not knowing anything about this movie and I walked out in an half hour knowing everything about it. It was one of worst movies I've ever seen. I'm a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie, I would probably never talk to them again. Anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry, hermit type personality. I'm gonna also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too, just like the self-centered fart bags who do the voices for the movie. I know everyone has different types of humor, some people may not even like mine, but that's okay; I don't think this covers any range of humor though. This movie is as flat and dull as Wes Anderson's mind. Go in and get ready to walk out; it's best to get your money back too.","finished_norm":["i","go","in","not","know","anyth","about","thi","movi","and","i","walk","out","in","a","half","hour","know","everyth","about","it","it","be","on","of","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","i","be","a","gener","a","nice","person","but","if","somebodi","tell","me","thei","like","thi","movi","i","would","probabl","never","talk","to","them","again","anybodi","who","like","it","throughli","be","much","like","to","have","a","extrem","spindri","hermit","typ","person","i","be","gonna","conjur","includ","that","thei","think","thei","be","pretti","intellig","too","just","like","the","selfcent","fart","bag","who","do","the","voic","for","the","movi","i","know","everyon","have","differ","typ","of","humor","some","peopl","mai","not","even","like","mine","but","that","okai","i","do","not","think","thi","cover","ani","rang","of","humor","though","thi","movi","be","a","flat","and","dull","a","we","anderson","mind","go","in","and","get","readi","to","walk","out","it","well","to","get","your","monei","back","too"],"filtered":["go","know","anyth","thi","movi","walk","half","hour","know","everyth","wrong","movi","ever","see","gener","nice","person","somebodi","tell","thei","like","thi","movi","probabl","never","talk","anybodi","like","throughli","much","like","extrem","spindri","hermit","typ","person","gonna","conjur","includ","thei","think","thei","pretti","intellig","like","selfcent","fart","bag","voic","movi","know","everyon","differ","typ","humor","peopl","mai","even","like","mine","okai","think","thi","cover","ani","rang","humor","though","thi","movi","flat","dull","anderson","mind","go","get","readi","walk","well","get","monei","back"],"filtered2":["go","know","anyth","walk","half","hour","know","everyth","wrong","ever","see","gener","nice","person","somebodi","tell","like","probabl","never","talk","anybodi","like","throughli","like","extrem","spindri","hermit","typ","person","gonna","conjur","includ","think","pretti","intellig","like","selfcent","fart","bag","voic","know","everyon","differ","typ","humor","peopl","mai","even","like","mine","okai","think","cover","ani","rang","humor","though","flat","dull","anderson","mind","go","get","readi","walk","well","get","monei","back"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,12,20,23,25,26,27,39,42,44,46,63,78,86,90,104,126,148,153,174,186,191,193,204,206,225,238,246,262,294,301,329,367,369,384,428,491,594,603,1082,1209,1334,1353,1447,1553,1580,1844,1897,3041,5104,8480],"values":[5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,12,20,23,25,26,27,39,42,44,46,63,78,86,90,104,126,148,153,174,186,191,193,204,206,225,238,246,262,294,301,329,367,369,384,428,491,594,603,1082,1209,1334,1353,1447,1553,1580,1844,1897,3041,5104,8480],"values":[3.230191472788289,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,2.133457220525776,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,3.9974772509130565,1.3002700588679295,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.8729627573220065,2.0064197866819473,2.031112399272319,2.0477128419653545,2.0728240170322856,2.2391270689902285,2.3018654096236517,4.681980408231769,2.456282578459816,2.571852579609833,2.5460113484259455,2.517840471459249,2.624524614047584,2.597304642813496,2.641219492619754,2.597304642813496,2.673149229007135,2.726701583487816,5.773557018660078,2.8309760279012264,2.951986790814132,3.0791938792932125,6.243658221875298,6.218409915418504,3.3721070011625462,3.369778711402955,3.490764544963862,3.530930586689197,4.165705761027235,4.3095999406873045,4.383707912841026,4.436351646326448,4.477736862489302,4.589376833631972,4.605250182788262,5.2288713006995975,4.85885294158718,5.521540914662417,6.137727054086234,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.15111656269687E-5,7.102894911920026E-5,7.158113146900832E-5,7.116753492880106E-5,7.116870092873517E-5,7.106922130706071E-5,7.128059112894733E-5,7.103917682375637E-5,0.028539540104199193,7.899129161287887E-5,0.9254743986716154,7.092450392995438E-5,7.2248274624553E-5,7.32789121376212E-5,7.097622133834279E-5,7.078007368591965E-5,7.254559408540742E-5,7.128726958228764E-5,7.106610110611205E-5,7.11250022685914E-5,7.181317838119257E-5,7.135789722737726E-5,7.143914901882232E-5,7.151611668933849E-5,7.206496614374623E-5,7.168808665865505E-5,7.470171763443716E-5,7.094558913466856E-5,7.094748709532379E-5,7.112723215267063E-5,7.263902482101038E-5,7.128313909375609E-5,7.651641129975414E-5,7.1483648045017E-5,7.102281021793471E-5,7.135062730580901E-5,7.09516435872493E-5,7.099357078836436E-5,7.077971808110664E-5,7.07980816054559E-5,7.095743948284635E-5,7.170589011491818E-5,7.134152235416096E-5,7.105945791751239E-5,7.192290484160214E-5,7.108673092576374E-5,7.344858999149
