{"value":"Saving Grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the 'How to Ruin an Adequate Film in the Final Few Minutes' award. Naturally if you mix a quaint Cornish village - largely populated by retired genteel ladies - with a liberal dose of marijuana, a certain amount of silliness will ensue. However, the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not even redeemed by being particularly funny. It is a real shame, because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998's Waking Ned Devine, which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation.<br /><br />The protagonist of Saving Grace is middle-aged, recently widowed Grace Trevethyn, whose husband's legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money. Helped by her gardener, Matthew, she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana. Unfortunately, this leads her into confrontation with the local police, her husband's creditors and a French drug baron. . . . . . . . . . whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously. The relationship and rapport between Grace and Matthew is well-portrayed, and Brenda Blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character - you can really feel what she is going through.<br /><br />The casting of the minor roles is excellent, even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric. However, the transformation of Jacques the drug lord into Grace's romantic interest is highly implausible and does not fit the tone of the movie at all. And surely hydroponics is not such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing? Sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants.","finished_norm":["save","grace","be","sure","on","of","the","lead","contend","for","the","how","to","ruin","a","adequ","film","in","the","final","few","minut","award","natur","if","you","mix","a","quaint","cornish","villag","larg","popul","by","retir","genteel","ladi","with","a","liber","dose","of","marijuana","a","certain","amount","of","silli","will","ensu","howev","the","last","seven","minut","of","the","film","descend","into","the","total","ludicr","and","be","not","even","redeem","by","be","particularli","funni","it","be","a","real","shame","becaus","thi","comedi","have","the","potenti","to","be","everi","bite","a","good","a","wake","ned","devin","which","conjur","portrai","a","picturesqu","small","villag","and","it","oddbal","inhabit","try","to","extract","themselv","from","a","tricki","situationbr","br","the","protagonist","of","save","grace","be","middleag","recent","widow","grace","trevethyn","whose","husband","legaci","of","bad","debt","have","forc","her","into","a","unconvent","wai","of","earn","monei","help","by","her","garden","matthew","she","turn","her","horticultur","expertis","to","the","lucr","cultiv","of","marijuana","unfortun","thi","lead","her","into","confront","with","the","local","polic","her","husband","creditor","and","a","french","drug","baron","whom","all","turn","up","at","her","greenhous","simultan","the","relationship","and","rapport","between","grace","and","matthew","be","wellportrai","and","brenda","blethyn","get","the","viewer","emotion","involv","with","her","likeabl","charact","you","can","realli","feel","what","she","be","go","throughbr","br","the","cast","of","the","minor","role","be","excel","even","if","some","of","them","be","rather","outlandishli","eccentr","howev","the","transform","of","jacqu","the","drug","lord","into","grace","romant","interest","be","highli","implaus","and","doe","not","fit","the","tone","of","the","movi","at","all","and","sure","hydropon","be","not","such","a","revolut","in","the","world","of","cannabi","grow","sadli","the","film","swap","gentl","humour","for","slapstick","and","end","up","be","a","fake","a","the","marijuana","plant"],"filtered":["save","grace","sure","lead","contend","ruin","adequ","film","final","minut","award","natur","mix","quaint","cornish","villag","larg","popul","retir","genteel","ladi","liber","dose","marijuana","certain","amount","silli","ensu","howev","last","seven","minut","film","descend","total","ludicr","even","redeem","particularli","funni","real","shame","becaus","thi","comedi","potenti","everi","bite","good","wake","ned","devin","conjur","portrai","picturesqu","small","villag","oddbal","inhabit","try","extract","themselv","tricki","situationbr","br","protagonist","save","grace","middleag","recent","widow","grace","trevethyn","whose","husband","legaci","bad","debt","forc","unconvent","wai","earn","monei","help","garden","matthew","turn","horticultur","expertis","lucr","cultiv","marijuana","unfortun","thi","lead","confront","local","polic","husband","creditor","french","drug","baron","turn","greenhous","simultan","relationship","rapport","grace","matthew","wellportrai","brenda","blethyn","get","viewer","emotion","involv","likeabl","charact","realli","feel","go","throughbr","br","cast","minor","role","excel","even","rather","outlandishli","eccentr","howev","transform","jacqu","drug","lord","grace","romant","interest","highli","implaus","doe","fit","tone","movi","sure","hydropon","revolut","world","cannabi","grow","sadli","film","swap","gentl","humour","slapstick","end","fake","marijuana","plant"],"filtered2":["save","grace","sure","lead","contend","ruin","adequ","final","minut","award","natur","mix","quaint","cornish","villag","larg","popul","retir","genteel","ladi","liber","dose","marijuana","certain","amount","silli","ensu","howev","last","seven","minut","descend","total","ludicr","even","redeem","particularli","funni","real","shame","becaus","comedi","potenti","everi","bite","good","wake","ned","devin","conjur","portrai","picturesqu","small","villag","oddbal","inhabit","try","extract","themselv","tricki","situationbr","protagonist","save","grace","middleag","recent","widow","grace","trevethyn","whose","husband","legaci","bad","debt","forc","unconvent","wai","earn","monei","help","garden","matthew","turn","horticultur","expertis","lucr","cultiv","marijuana","unfortun","lead","confront","local","polic","husband","creditor","french","drug","baron","turn","greenhous","simultan","relationship","rapport","grace","matthew","wellportrai","brenda","blethyn","get","viewer","emotion","involv","likeabl","charact","realli","feel","go","throughbr","cast","minor","role","excel","even","rather","outlandishli","eccentr","howev","transform","jacqu","drug","lord","grace","romant","interest","highli","implaus","doe","fit","tone","sure","hydropon","revolut","world","cannabi","grow","sadli","swap","gentl","humour","slapstick","end","fake","marijuana","plant"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,5,6,9,10,13,18,

{"value":"Oh, brother...after hearing about this ridiculous film for umpteen years all I can think of is that old Peggy Lee song..<br /><br />\"Is that all there is??\" ...I was just an early teen when this smoked fish hit the U.S. I was too young to get in the theater (although I did manage to sneak into \"Goodbye Columbus\"). Then a screening at a local film museum beckoned - Finally I could see this film, except now I was as old as my parents were when they schlepped to see it!!<br /><br />The ONLY reason this film was not condemned to the anonymous sands of time was because of the obscenity case sparked by its U.S. release. MILLIONS of people flocked to this stinker, thinking they were going to see a sex film...Instead, they got lots of closeups of gnarly, repulsive Swedes, on-street interviews in bland shopping malls, asinie political pretension...and feeble who-cares simulated sex scenes with saggy, pale actors.<br /><br />Cultural icon, holy grail, historic artifact..whatever this thing was, shred it, burn it, then stuff the ashes in a lead box!<br /><br />Elite esthetes still scrape to find value in its boring pseudo revolutionary political spewings..But if it weren't for the censorship scandal, it would have been ignored, then forgotten.<br /><br />Instead, the \"I Am Blank, Blank\" rhythymed title was repeated endlessly for years as a titilation for porno films (I am Curious, Lavender - for gay films, I Am Curious, Black - for blaxploitation films, etc..) and every ten years or so the thing rises from the dead, to be viewed by a new generation of suckers who want to see that \"naughty sex

{"value":"(aka: DEMONS III)<br /><br />Made for Italian TV although shot in English and was never meant to be a sequel to the earlier DEMONS films. It was supposed to be simply titled, THE OGRE, which is how director Lamberto Bava had released it.<br /><br />An American family rents an Italian villa for the summer. The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl going down to the old wine-cellar of this villa an encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging down from the ceiling. It glows and is covered in cobwebs and has what looks like spider or insect legs hanging down from it. It drips what looks like green paint.<br /><br />Of course the husband doesn't believe any of this. The villa just is old and creaks and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it.<br /><br />But then the OGRE itself appears in what looks like some kind of 16th Centaury costume with what looks like a wolf's head attached to it and it's attracted to the scent of orchids.<br /><br />The films isn't really that bad and at least the dialog is halfway intelligent without the ridiculous awkward phrases that dubbing would bring. There's no real gore other than some skeletons rotting in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. The OGRE itself just simply fades away after it is run over by the family's Jeep Cherokee. <br /><br />The copy of the Shriek DVD I watched was defective, with the picture going black for a few seconds about a half an hour into the film, a flaw I hope Shriek has since corrected. Extras include a short interview with Lamberto Bava where he explains how this wasn't a sequel, etc..etc...along with some trailers to other Shriek DVD releases.

{"value":"I saw this movie for a number of reasons the main being Mira Sorvino. With her on the cast it couldn't be so bad. And it even seemed like it had some mystery and Olivier Martinez was her boyfriend at the time and he was pretty good in `Unfaithful'. The story is set in Spain so it could be an exotic entertaining movie with one of my favorite actresses.<br /><br />If you're thinking about the same thing let me warn you: this is a truly awful, uninteresting, boring movie. The only adjective that comes to mind is pathetic.<br /><br />The story is contrived with sub-plots that add nothing to the narrative. They try to build a slasher/thriller with a look at fascism in Spain but fail horribly. The twists have no credibility and the so-called investigation leads nowhere.<br /><br />The characters are paper-thin! I didn't care about anyone. More than that they're irritating and pretty hateful people.<br /><br />The acting is atrocious. Mira what is wrong with you? Why Mira? You're an oscar winner! Keep some dignity! Her character was weak but that is no excuse for such an awful performance. She seems to be sleepwalking all movie long. Come to think of it, I actually think I saw her eyes slowly closing in some scenes. I used to think this woman was sexy. Well she isn't here. If you want to look at some skin try Romi and Michelle because there's nothing to see here. And that accent? My god...<br /><br />Olivier Martinez is even worst. It's too painful to remember his performance to describe it here. Im sorry but I can´t. Ive suffered enough with this garbage.<br /><br />This whole movie is depressing! It's so bad in every way it's a wonder how it was even made. A lousy team to produce a lousy script and make some money over the actor's name.

{"value":"2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that is being overly generous.<br /><br />I thought with a cast of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett, Jr., and Henry Thomas - how could it miss. I was wrong.<br /><br />I can only wonder what drugs Sam Shepard was on the week-end he cranked out this piece of dribble. I'd long suspected Sam S. of being kind of nuts, this film, based on his play, confirms it.<br /><br />This is the kind of artsy b.s. that actors LOVE to sink their teeth into as it gives them a chance to endlessly emote. However, for the viewer who sits through this nonsensical trash, there is absolutely NOTHING to love about this movie.<br /><br />You haven't seen dysfunctional families until you've seen this bunch. Pa is crazy, Ma is crazy, the son is crazy and the daughter is, oh yeah, crazy. They also have mouths on them that utter words that would make a sailor blush, especially the teenage daughter.<br /><br />In addition to the above, as if that weren't enough, the plot--and it's so thin you could read thorough it--has a hole in it the size of Alaska.<br /><br />Ma is conspiring to sell their rundown farm. As it turns out so is Pa. Now I don't claim to be a real estate expert, but the last time I checked, property jointly owned must have both of the owners signatures in order to be sold. If only one of them owned the property, then the other could not legally sell it, so it would be pointless for that person to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this basic fact, and therefore, his plot does not work.<br /><br />Not that anything else was really working anyway.<br /><br />The only possible reason anyone could have for watching this film is if they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can't imagine why anyone would want to.","finished_norm":["star","out","of","a","possibl","and","that","be","be","overli","generousbr","br","i","think","with","a","cast","of","jame","wood","cathi","bate","randi","quaid","lou","gossett","jr","and","henri","thoma","how","can","it","miss","i","be","wrongbr","br","i","can","onli","wonder","what","drug","sam","shepard","be","on","the","weekend","he","crank","out","thi","piec","of","dribbl","i","have","long","suspect","sam","of","be","kind","of","nut","thi","film","base","on","hi","plai","confirm","itbr","br","thi","be","the","kind","of","artsi","b","that","actor","love","to","sink","their","tooth","into","a","it","give","them","a","chanc","to","endlessli","emot","howev","for","the","viewer","who","sit","through","thi","nonsens","trash","there","be","absolut","noth","to","love","about","thi","moviebr","br","you","have","not","see","dysfunct","famili","until","you","have","see","thi","bunch","pa","be","crazi","ma","be","crazi","the","son","be","crazi","and","the","daughter","be","oh","ye","crazi","thei","conjur","have","mouth","on","them","that","utter","word","that","would","make","a","sailor","blush","especi","the","teenag","daughterbr","br","in","addit","to","the","abov","a","if","that","be","not","enough","the","plotand","it","so","thin","you","can","read","thorough","itha","a","hole","in","it","the","size","of","alaskabr","br","ma","be","conspir","to","sell","their","rundown","farm","a","it","turn","out","so","be","pa","now","i","do","not","claim","to","be","a","real","estat","expert","but","the","last","time","i","check","properti","jointli","own","must","have","both","of","the","owner","signatur","in","order","to","be","sell","if","onli","on","of","them","own","the","properti","then","the","other","can","not","legal","sell","it","so","it","would","be","pointless","for","that","person","to","do","so","mr","shepherd","prefer","to","ignor","thi","basic","fact","and","therefor","hi","plot","doe","not","workbr","br","not","that","anyth","els","be","realli","work","anywaybr","br","the","onli","possibl","reason","anyon","can","have","for","watch","thi","film","be","if","thei","be","absolut","desper","to","see","jame","wood","in","full","frontal","nuditi","and","i","ca","not","imagin","why","anyon","would","want","to"],"filtered":["star","possibl","overli","generousbr","br","think","cast","jame","wood","cathi","bate","randi","quaid","lou","gossett","jr","henri","thoma","miss","wrongbr","br","onli","wonder","drug","sam","shepard","weekend","crank","thi","piec","dribbl","long","suspect","sam","kind","nut","thi","film","base","hi","plai","confirm","itbr","br","thi","kind","artsi","b","actor","love","sink","tooth","give","chanc","endlessli","emot","howev","viewer","sit","thi","nonsens","trash","absolut","noth","love","thi","moviebr","br","see","dysfunct","famili","see","thi","bunch","pa","crazi","ma","crazi","son","crazi","daughter","oh","ye","crazi","thei","conjur","mouth","utter","word","make","sailor","blush","especi","teenag","daughterbr","br","addit","abov","enough","plotand","thin","read","thorough","itha","hole","size","alaskabr","br","ma","conspir","sell","rundown","farm","turn","pa","claim","real","estat","expert","last","time","check","properti","jointli","must","owner","signatur","order","sell","onli","properti","legal","sell","pointless","person","mr","shepherd","prefer","ignor","thi","basic","fact","therefor","hi","plot","doe","workbr","br","anyth","els","realli","work","anywaybr","br","onli","possibl","reason","anyon","watch","thi","film","thei","absolut","desper","see","jame","wood","full","frontal","nuditi","ca","imagin","anyon","want"],"filtered2":["star","possibl","overli","generousbr","think","cast","jame","wood","cathi","bate","randi","quaid","lou","gossett","jr","henri","thoma","miss","wrongbr","onli","wonder","drug","sam","shepard","weekend","crank","piec","dribbl","long","suspect","sam","kind","nut","base","plai","confirm","itbr","kind","artsi","b","actor","love","sink","tooth","give","chanc","endlessli","emot","howev","viewer","sit","nonsens","trash","absolut","noth","love","moviebr","see","dysfunct","famili","see","bunch","pa","crazi","ma","crazi","son","crazi","daughter","oh","ye","crazi","conjur","mouth","utter","word","make","sailor","blush","especi","teenag","daughterbr","addit","abov","enough","plotand","thin","read","thorough","itha","hole","size","alaskabr","ma","conspir","sell","rundown","farm","turn","pa","claim","real","estat","expert","last","time","check","properti","jointli","must","owner","signatur","order","sell","onli","properti","legal","sell","pointless","person","mr","shepherd","prefer","ignor","basic","fact","therefor","plot","doe","workbr","anyth","els","realli","work","anywaybr","onli","possibl","reason","anyon","watch","absolut","desper","see","jame","wood","full","frontal","nuditi","ca","imagin","anyon","want"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,11,12,13,18,30,32,37,39,40,41,48,49,54,80,81,92,93,95,96,97,99,100,104,113,122,141,144,145,153,

{"value":"PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly made, unedited, sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved - an outing that should have been nixed from the start. It is just another Mafia-based 'comedy' that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating.<br /><br />Joe Maloni (Paul Sorvino) is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control. His personal assistant Mario (Anthony DeSando) is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny. Maloni has whacked one of his debtors (who just happens to be married to bookish Fran - Diane Keaton) and Maloni takes Fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband's debt by being Maloni's 'hit man'. Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out Maloni's assignments, electing instead to transport her 'whackees' to Florida to hide at her brother James' house until she can figure out what to do next. This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B, Plan A being to kill them! The ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters.<br /><br />Diane Keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes, but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch. Paul Sorvino is, well, the Paul Sorvino type cast from other mobster films. The supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick, pratfall fashion imaginable. What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone. Director Greg Yaitanes needs to go back to TV sitcoms: had this flimsy story been compressed into a half-hour gig it might have had a chance.

{"value":"A real head scratcher of a film by Bill Rebane who appeared to be getting worse in his trade throughout the eighties. Three crackpot millionaires invite nine people to a remote hotel to compete in a last person standing contest in which the final contestant will be given $1 million provided he or she makes it that far. A series of lame pranks are pulled on some of the guests while the others engage in what most adults would do under the circumstances namely get shatfaced at the hotel bar. Most scenes are merely an excuse to focus the camera on various female body parts including an opening dance number that is a crossover of American Bandstand meets geriatric aerobics complete with hookers. If there was any hesitation that white people can't dance this scene hammers the final nail in that coffin. Pay close attention for the nipple slip. This continues on for about forty-five minutes until Bill Rebane begins throwing darts at various plot twists and whatever he hits becomes the inspiration for the next scene making this one incoherent mess. It's a game until it's not a game. The three old coots are in complete control until they're not. The hotel is possessed by a supernatural force until it becomes just props. They're dead until they're not. Even the narrator at the end replies that he doesn't know what the hell happened. I defy anyone to reason where Rebane was going on this one. The acting is dinner theater caliber minus the dinner. Most of the actors probably went back to their day jobs at the local Stuckey's. I give it a few points for the scene where the yuppie broad opens the closet and a skeleton is inside skull humping himself. Let's see Gone With the Wind do that!

{"value":"Trying to cash in on the success of Deal Or No Deal and 1 Versus 100 comes this lame excuse for entertainment - Show Me The Money, in which 12 sexy 'dancers' shimmy out in shiny red hooker attire. A contestant is given the beginning of a phrase, such as \"Which team lost . . .\" with three choices, A, B, or C, each which completes the phrase. The contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices. The host - William Shatner, at his obnoxious smarmiest - asks the contestant if he wants to \"lock into the answer\" and when the contestant says yes, he picks a 'dancer', to whom he yells \"Show me the money!\" She opens a scroll that has an amount, and if his answer was right, he adds that amount to his winnings; if he was wrong, the amount is subtracted. (So theoretically, it is possible for a contestant on this dreary debacle to actually wind up owing Shatner money.) There is also a \"Killer Card\" and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile scroll, but he has answered properly, nothing happens. If he's answered wrong, the game goes into Sudden Death and has to answer another question. If he gets that one wrong, he leaves with nothing.<br /><br />Before going to commercials, Shatner yells, \"let's dance\" and Shatner, the contestant and the 12 dancers shake booty. At the end of the show, Shatner asks the ladies for \"a last dance\" and they all shake it some more.<br /><br />I give this show 6 episodes at the very most, at which time hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door. (It could've been worse - they could've somehow bribed Cuba Gooding Jr to be the host, although I bet he's a better dancer than 'Shat,' as they call him these days.)<br /><br />7/08: Guess what - I was wrong!

{"value":"...they bothered making this movie? Anyone? I didn't think so.<br /><br />If you are looking for a coming-of-age movie, go rent Summer of '42. This is no Summer of '42.<br /><br />When your big stars are Nolte & Sarsgaard, & Sarsgaard gets more screen time, that is your first warning sign And, of course, for such an \"artsy\" movie, there is plenty of cursing & skin flung around, just to make it look \"artsy\".<br /><br />Sarsgaard did his usual uninteresting, cardboard character, punctuated by moments that were supposed to be intense. The intensity is that of someone with bi-polar disorder.<br /><br />Miller is most famous for her looks & what she had to say about the city of Pittsburgh after this movie. Pittsburgh SHOULD hold a grudge against her. She misrepresented an actual Pittsburgh native.<br /><br />Foster gave Sarsgaard a run for his money in the cardboard acting style. Wow! Was this his first role after high school graduation?<br /><br />So, we have this weird triangle. Foster has a crush on Miller, but is with his boss/girlfriend. He can't take Miller to bed, & won't take his boss to bed. So, he hangs with Sarsgaard & Miller, & watches them get it on.<br /><br />Then, after one of Sarsgaard's pseudo-intense moments, Foster & Miller get it on, a scene that we are \"treated\" to in every sloppy, moaning detail. Finally, just to round it all out, Foster & Sarsgaard get it on, with Foster in the Miller role. Now I know how 2 guys get it on (as if that was ever anything I needed to know).<br /><br />After all that, all that's left is the tragic ending for one character & the retrospective views of the remaining 2.

{"value":"OK, admittedly as an Orthodox woman who LIVES in Boro Park, I'm going to be a little biased against this film. However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin's sole purpose in making this film was Orthodox-bashing. With our wigs, modest attire, and separate seating, we're a pretty easy target already. Yakin never made it past the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia off for loving him more than G-d or their parents. Then he deliberately defies his father's order that he not go swimming because of his poor health. 2. Sonia flips out at her son's bris. Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It's hard to believe that she never attended one before. Let's face it, even Reform Jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays. 3. Was Mendel sleeping during his chosson classes? He's supposed to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to have been married for over a year, and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other? A little clue--arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with. Nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesn't work out. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly, she did not have to go through her lecherous brother-in-law. There are Orthodox female doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat back and waited for things to happen, and then complained that she didn't like the outcome. That's not standing up to one's environment; that's pandering to stereotype.

{"value":"I just have to add, in case anyone actually reads this and hasn't completely gotten the point yet. These other reviewers aren't joking around, this really IS the worst colour movie you're likely to ever see. When the movie started I couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see.<br /><br />They're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie. It really does. Like the \"director\" took the family hi8 camcorder (before DV cameras and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (lights, sound gear, etc), grabbed some decent-looking acting students, and went out to shoot a movie. No script, just making it up as he went along.<br /><br />When I watched it, it was on my mono TV, so I only have one channel of audio (left of right speaker). At first I thought I'd hooked it up wrong. The movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in. I got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly I could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog. They recorded the sound on different bloody channels! I mean, there's movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they're good, kind of thing. I'm not sure this is one of those. I mean, I'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker. And seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and PROVE you can do it better, you know. But watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it.<br /><br />As bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about this. I thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene. A bit of T and A from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4. But alas, no. If you want to make a movie but it's turning out crap, throw in some gratuitous nudity.

{"value":"I expected a bad movie, and got a bad movie. But I couldn't really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was. I don't even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is about. Is not about blood surfing, but a big a$$ crocodile. They are complaining about the fake shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and didn't show the shark until the end. Here the crocodile is shown a lot of times, and it's the worst fake crocodile I have ever seen, and they don't try to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch Lake Placid. <br /><br />The director had an opportunity to make a decent surf/shark movie, but he had to make a bad b-monster movie. He had the chance to make an original surf movie, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you have understand how bad this movie is, does it have some good parts? Not really, it got some nudity, and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie. The acting isn't half bad either, and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad she doesn't take her top off. The lead actors aren't bad either. They had some potential. The location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes. The blame is on the untalented writer and director. The dialogue is some of the worst I have ever seen, and the script is really badly written, and the director got no talent what so ever, and not much of a fantasy either.<br /><br />Don't watch it. Even if you want to watch the beautiful Kate Fischer. It isn't worth it. Watch Sirens to watch Kate nude, and watch Lake Placid if you want some good crocodile action.<br /><br />3/10 because I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked, and Kate looks good

{"value":"Was there a single positive to this film? Critics who knew nothing of video games could spot the gaming errors made. No damage taken with damage clearly visible towards the beginning being a primary example.<br /><br />And I may have missed something, but wasn't Super Mario Bros. 3 suppose to be a game that had never played before? Well if that IS the case, and I did not miss anything... how did Fred Savage's character, and even the girl, know so much about the game already? We're talking things that some people don't know about by their second or third play-through.<br /><br />Beyond the factual and gaming errors there is the general low quality of the film itself. Nothing here is honestly very memorable. The kid wasn't even that good at playing video games in the footage they showed. A lot of kids I knew way back in those days were significantly more experienced. On top of all this the acting and storyline are just mediocre at their strongest points. The characters are bland and completely uninteresting, the 'Wizard' (the youngest child) is a very silent, completely dry child cliché of a little kid who almost never talks because of a trauma. It isn't that this is unrealistic, it's the fact that it had to be thrown into the movie to actually even begin to form a plot that would exceed even 30 minutes.<br /><br />Honestly, the only value that is to be found here is that of a nostalgic nature. If you grew up with this movie you're going to like it whether it was good or not. It was about kids playing video games, and at the time you saw it you likely had an obsession with the NES as well.

{"value":"I can't believe I've just spent one and a half hours watching such a weak film. If there is only one film you have to miss, this is the one.<br /><br />Robert is a teenager whose father's died recently so he starts hanging out with some local anti-social teenagers and using drugs. All these make him subconsciously more violent and at last such subconsciousness explodes...<br /><br />The first thing is that I don't think I can find any sense or trace of great ecstasy in this film, not in any single character. If the director considers what I saw in the last couple of minutes as great ecstasy, I have to say that that's not even close.<br /><br />The use of cinematography is also not mature. Most of the time I couldn't see any facial expressions from the actors and I didn't feel the body language was sufficient enough to make an impact. Maybe the crew was just so tired that they fixed the camera there to include everything in the settings. Everybody happy except the audience.<br /><br />The plot is particularly weak. There are a lot of unrelated scenes and talking which might be supposed to be related but they are really so random that you can never pull them all together, perhaps unless you're the one who wrote them.<br /><br />In the one and a half hour you may find less than 5 minutes of real acting and all other time there are just people walking, talking and moving. So I really can't comment on acting here.<br /><br />Nice choice of music in the last couple of minutes though. Maybe this is the only good thing.<br /><br />I have never given a film a 1 but this film certainly deserves it (at least you laugh when you watch Scary Movies). This is a film about when a failed attempt to portray troubled teenagers meets extremely disturbed audience.

{"value":"This has to be THE WORST film I have ever seen. I bought the DVD and it didn't work, well the DVD worked fine, its just the film didn't, in fact its so bad that I think non of the actors have worked since (or before judging from the acting). There is no real plot to speak of and no real horror. The production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphone.<br /><br />All in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they didn't know any better (which have been an improvement). There are only two lines in the film that are funny, both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute. (Although they hardly merit watching all 76 minutes for)<br /><br />As for the marketing of the DVD I feel thoroughly cheated. I mean reading the back I expected it to be bad:<br /><br />He chose his weapons. He selected his victims. He picked his nose. He turned into a GIRL!<br /><br />But I thought it might be funny. Also the case claims it is digitally re mastered, I would love to have seen it beforehand, the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper. The case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie, IN WHAT WAY?, disgusting production, acting.<br /><br />This film out stays it welcome in the first five minutes, (if you are considering buying this I would say buy `bad taste' instead it is a much better film and is funny, also it has Peter Jackson the director of the LOTR in it.)<br /><br />Incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the actors (or director Patrick J Mathews) and what they have done since, please post here as I would love to know, purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there, or if anyone in this film

{"value":"I'd passed this title 15 or 20 times while in Blockbuster, looking for something halfway decent to watch. All I can say is that they were all out halfway decent films the night I chose to rent this.<br /><br />I will give it credit for being leaps and bounds better than \"Dracula 3000\", but in actuality that's pretty easy to say since this one DIDN'T have Caper Van Dien in it. The other things it lacked in spades were: an interesting cast, interesting story, good dialog and originality, but I suppose you can't have everything.<br /><br />***SPOILERS AHEAD*** The misfit crew of vampire hunters (one of which was a vampire... go figure) flew around from mining colony to mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires it could find. The crew consists of: the cocky, ne'er-do-well captain (who dies early on), his by-the-book, yet inexperienced first mate, the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter (not a typo), a wannabe cowboy and a REALLY, REALLY butch Asian commando, \"tough guy\" female... it almost sounds like the cast for MTV's 'The Real World'. After the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of bloodsuckers (and as it turns out, lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy) his first mate takes over... blah, blah, blah... everyone hates him... blah, blah, blah... I could go on, but as I said it's the same storyline used in about a hundred other 'films' of the genre.<br /><br />The effects were cheese and why Michael Ironside was in this movie is beyond me. The vampire vampire hunter (still not a typo) was pretty hot, but of course if you're waiting for her to expose more than just her cleavage, look elsewhere.<br /><br />I can't say that it was the worst film I've seen, as I actually rented 'Starship Troopers 2', but wait for this one to come on the Sci-Fi Channel.","finished_norm":["i","have","pass","thi","titl","or","time","while","in","blockbust","look","for","someth","halfwai","decent","to","watch","all","i","can","sai","be","that","thei","be","all","out","halfwai","decent","film","the","night","i","choos","to","rend","thisbr","br","i","will","give","it","credit","for","be","leap","and","bound","well","than","dracula","but","in","actual","that","pretti","easi","to","sai","sinc","thi","on","didn","t","have","caper","van","dien","in","it","the","other","thing","it","lack","in","spade","be","a","interest","cast","interest","stori","good","dialog","and","origin","but","i","suppos","you","ca","not","have","everythingbr","br","spoiler","ahead","the","misfit","crow","of","vampir","hunter","on","of","which","be","a","vampir","go","figur","fly","around","from","mine","coloni","to","mine","coloni","try","to","wipe","out","all","the","vampir","it","can","find","the","crow","consist","of","the","cocki","neerdowel","captain","who","die","earli","on","hi","bythebook","yet","inexperienc","mate","the","aforement","vampir","vampir","hunter","not","a","typo","a","wannab","cowboi","and","a","realli","realli","butch","asian","commando","tough","gui","femal","it","almost","sound","like","the","cast","for","mtv","the","real","world","after","the","captain","die","in","a","violent","confront","with","a","mob","of","bloodsuck","and","a","it","turn","out","lover","of","the","fine","part","of","human","anatomi","hi","mate","take","over","blah","blah","blah","everyon","hate","him","blah","blah","blah","i","can","go","on","but","a","i","sai","it","the","same","storylin","us","in","about","a","hundr","other","film","of","the","genrebr","br","the","effect","be","chees","and","why","michael","ironsid","be","in","thi","movi","be","beyond","me","the","vampir","vampir","hunter","still","not","a","typo","be","pretti","hot","but","of","cours","if","you","re","wait","for","her","to","expos","much","than","just","her","cleavag","look","elsewherebr","br","i","ca","not","sai","that","it","be","the","wrong","film","i","have","see","a","i","actual","rent","starship","trooper","but","wait","for","thi","on","to","come","on","the","scifi","channel"],"filtered":["pass","thi","titl","time","blockbust","look","someth","halfwai","decent","watch","sai","thei","halfwai","decent","film","night","choos","rend","thisbr","br","give","credit","leap","bound","well","dracula","actual","pretti","easi","sai","sinc","thi","didn","caper","van","dien","thing","lack","spade","interest","cast","interest","stori","good","dialog","origin","suppos","ca","everythingbr","br","spoiler","ahead","misfit","crow","vampir","hunter","vampir","go","figur","fly","around","mine","coloni","mine","coloni","try","wipe","vampir","find","crow","consist","cocki","neerdowel","captain","die","earli","hi","bythebook","yet","inexperienc","mate","aforement","vampir","vampir","hunter","typo","wannab","cowboi","realli","realli","butch","asian","commando","tough","gui","femal","almost","sound","like","cast","mtv","real","world","captain","die","violent","confront","mob","bloodsuck","turn","lover","fine","part","human","anatomi","hi","mate","take","blah","blah","blah","everyon","hate","blah","blah","blah","go","sai","storylin","us","hundr","film","genrebr","br","effect","chees","michael","ironsid","thi","movi","beyond","vampir","vampir","hunter","still","typo","pretti","hot","cours","re","wait","expos","much","cleavag","look","elsewherebr","br","ca","sai","wrong","film","see","actual","rent","starship","trooper","wait","thi","come","scifi","channel"],"filtered2":["pass","titl","time","blockbust","look","someth","halfwai","decent","watch","halfwai","decent","night","choos","rend","thisbr","give","credit","leap","bound","well","dracula","actual","pretti","easi","sinc","didn","caper","van","dien","thing","lack","spade","interest","cast","interest","stori","good","dialog","origin","suppos","ca","everythingbr","spoiler","ahead","misfit","crow","vampir","hunter","vampir","go","figur","fly","around","mine","coloni","mine","coloni","try","wipe","vampir","find","crow","consist","cocki","neerdowel","captain","die","earli","bythebook","yet","inexperienc","mate","aforement","vampir","vampir","hunter","typo","wannab","cowboi","realli","realli","butch","asian","commando","tough","gui","femal","almost","sound","like","cast","mtv","real","world","captain","die","violent","confront","mob","bloodsuck","turn","lover","fine","part","human","anatomi","mate","take","blah","blah","blah","everyon","hate","blah","blah","blah","go","storylin","us","hundr","genrebr","effect","chees","michael","ironsid","beyond","vampir","vampir","hunter","still","typo","pretti","hot","cours","re","wait","expos","cleavag","look","elsewherebr","ca","wrong","see","actual","rent","starship","trooper","wait","come","scifi","channel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,7,8,13,16,17,20,25,29,30,31,34,36,38,52,53,55,56,60,61,64,68,69,78,80,81,92,96,98,106,131,149,162,165,178,183,194

{"value":"I didn't have HUGE expectations for this film when renting it for $1 at the video store, but the box at least showed a little promise with its \"killer cut\" of \"more gore! more sex!\" Can't go wrong there! Well... needless to say, the box is a fraud. How in the hades did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this low?<br /><br />It all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend (?) as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her. Then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another. They slit her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they \"cut\" her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon.<br /><br />From there, repeat the same theme of the girl getting chased/killed unbrutally by two guys for about 84 more minutes. Add in one tit shot. That is Soul Survivors.<br /><br />I wouldn't have had a problem with this film had the box not frauded me into renting the flick. If I rent a bad film that claims to have more violence and sex.... I want more violence and sex! One full frontal shot in 85 minutes from a chick who is clearly androginous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it. If this is the Killer Cut, what is the Theatrical Cut?! Of course, I doubt this garbage was actually put into theaters in the first place. Shame on the actors in this film. I could see them making their screen debuts in here because they have not done anything before, but they were all established before this was released. I don't know if it was filmed before they had all been established and the studio sat on the film until they were semi-big names or not. But what i want to know is.... they really spent $14 million on this

{"value":"This version moved a little slow for my taste and I suppose I have problems with this play to begin with. But first the movie, it's a typical TV movie version of a play which means it doesn't have the flair of the original film version with William Holden. What they couldn't afford to hire more than twelve people as extras? Why move the movie up to 1966? So you could give the little sister a line about the Vietnam war protests? Why not 1963 and give her a line about the civil rights movement?<br /><br />As for the casting, some hits some misses. Jay O. Sanders hit the right notes for his character especially with his scenes with Josh Brolin. Brolin on the other hand miss a lot of the notes. He's believable as an ex-BMOC jock but he doesn't have the raw sensuality of William Holden. I always thought Brolin looks a little bit like a gorilla to have all the women in town go ape over him (pardon the pun). Gretchen Moll was lovely but she seemed a little too wise for the character she played. She didn't project the innocence or ignorance that the character required. Maybe it's because she and Brolin were about 5 years older than the characters should be. But then again Holden was ten years too old. Bonnie Bedelia was rather forgettable as the mother and Mary Steenburgen can't seem to make up her mind whether she was playing Blanche duBois or Katharine from \"The Taming of The Shrew\".<br /><br />As for Mr. Inge's play, I always felt that stories like this of a young woman choosing passion over practicality always needed an epilogue. \"The Twilight Zone\" I believe offer a likely epilogue with the episode, \"Spur of the Moment\" where a young Diana Hyland was being chased by a bitter older Diana Hyland, because the younger Diana Hyland chose to run off with a guy similar to Hal Carter.","finished_norm":["thi","version","move","a","littl","slow","for","my","tast","and","i","suppos","i","have","problem","with","thi","plai","to","begin","with","but","the","movi","it","a","typic","tv","movi","version","of","a","plai","which","mean","it","doe","not","have","the","flair","of","the","origin","film","version","with","william","holden","what","thei","can","not","afford","to","hire","much","than","twelv","peopl","a","extra","why","move","the","movi","up","to","so","you","can","give","the","littl","sister","a","line","about","the","vietnam","war","protest","why","not","and","give","her","a","line","about","the","civil","right","movementbr","br","a","for","the","cast","some","hit","some","miss","jai","o","sander","hit","the","right","note","for","hi","charact","especi","with","hi","scene","with","josh","brolin","brolin","on","the","other","hand","miss","a","lot","of","the","note","he","believ","a","a","exbmoc","jock","but","he","doe","not","have","the","raw","sensual","of","william","holden","i","alwai","think","brolin","look","a","littl","bite","like","a","gorilla","to","have","all","the","woman","in","town","go","ap","over","him","pardon","the","pun","gretchen","moll","be","love","but","she","seem","a","littl","too","wise","for","the","charact","she","plai","she","do","not","project","the","innoc","or","ignor","that","the","charact","requir","mayb","it","becaus","she","and","brolin","be","about","year","old","than","the","charact","should","be","but","then","again","holden","be","ten","year","too","old","bonni","bedelia","be","rather","forgett","a","the","mother","and","mari","steenburgen","ca","not","seem","to","make","up","her","mind","whether","she","be","plai","blanch","duboi","or","katharin","from","the","tame","of","the","shrewbr","br","a","for","mr","ing","plai","i","alwai","feel","that","stori","like","thi","of","a","young","woman","choos","passion","over","practic","alwai","ne","a","epilogu","the","twilight","zone","i","believ","offer","a","like","epilogu","with","the","episod","spur","of","the","moment","where","a","young","diana","hyland","be","be","chase","by","a","bitter","old","diana","hyland","becaus","the","young","diana","hyland","choos","to","run","off","with","a","gui","similar","to","hal","carter"],"filtered":["thi","version","move","littl","slow","tast","suppos","problem","thi","plai","begin","movi","typic","tv","movi","version","plai","mean","doe","flair","origin","film","version","william","holden","thei","afford","hire","much","twelv","peopl","extra","move","movi","give","littl","sister","line","vietnam","war","protest","give","line","civil","right","movementbr","br","cast","hit","miss","jai","o","sander","hit","right","note","hi","charact","especi","hi","scene","josh","brolin","brolin","hand","miss","lot","note","believ","exbmoc","jock","doe","raw","sensual","william","holden","alwai","think","brolin","look","littl","bite","like","gorilla","woman","town","go","ap","pardon","pun","gretchen","moll","love","seem","littl","wise","charact","plai","project","innoc","ignor","charact","requir","mayb","becaus","brolin","year","old","charact","holden","ten","year","old","bonni","bedelia","rather","forgett","mother","mari","steenburgen","ca","seem","make","mind","whether","plai","blanch","duboi","katharin","tame","shrewbr","br","mr","ing","plai","alwai","feel","stori","like","thi","young","woman","choos","passion","practic","alwai","ne","epilogu","twilight","zone","believ","offer","like","epilogu","episod","spur","moment","young","diana","hyland","chase","bitter","old","diana","hyland","becaus","young","diana","hyland","choos","run","gui","similar","hal","carter"],"filtered2":["version","move","littl","slow","tast","suppos","problem","plai","begin","typic","tv","version","plai","mean","doe","flair","origin","version","william","holden","afford","hire","twelv","peopl","extra","move","give","littl","sister","line","vietnam","war","protest","give","line","civil","right","movementbr","cast","hit","miss","jai","o","sander","hit","right","note","charact","especi","scene","josh","brolin","brolin","hand","miss","lot","note","believ","exbmoc","jock","doe","raw","sensual","william","holden","alwai","think","brolin","look","littl","bite","like","gorilla","woman","town","go","ap","pardon","pun","gretchen","moll","love","seem","littl","wise","charact","plai","project","innoc","ignor","charact","requir","mayb","becaus","brolin","year","old","charact","holden","ten","year","old","bonni","bedelia","rather","forgett","mother","mari","steenburgen","ca","seem","make","mind","whether","plai","blanch","duboi","katharin","tame","shrewbr","mr","ing","plai","alwai","feel","stori","like","young","woman","choos","passion","practic","alwai","ne","epilogu","twilight","zone","believ","offer","like","epilogu","spur","moment","young","diana","hyland","chase","bitter","old","diana","hyland","becaus","young","diana","hyland","choos","run","gui","similar","hal","carter"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indic

{"value":"The movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (I'm sorry I'm biased, i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies), and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than Azumi 1. I watched Azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. I amazed myself being able to sit through it. <br /><br />Lets talk about the plus points of the movie. The girl. Ueto Aya is cute. Thats all there is to salvage the whole movie. The fact is, if the main character was male, i am sure that most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all. <br /><br />Now lets talk about the minus points. Firstly, it is real draggy, with lots and lots of repeated scenes. Scenes of Nachi and Azumi keeps coming back. It seems more like a drama way of shooting. Typical Japanese dramas love flashbacks, and this movie too. Secondly, the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting. I do not mind unrealistic movies. But this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness, by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs, etc... it reminds me of Shinobi, though Shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. Moreover, to portray \"i-don't-know\" what effect, the director films people dying with blood spraying (literally) all around... people not realizing their head was cut off... etc.. etc... etc... Too many of these spoils the show. It seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie. It degrades the show greatly. Thirdly, Isn't Azumi supposed to be an assassin. She seems more like an one-man-army to me, just that she is a female. I don't think you see assassins charging into army camps. The only time i felt she acted \"assassin-liked\" was when she killed the Kiyomasa Kato at the end of Azumi 1. Lastly, the plot was thin in both movies. Its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way.","finished_norm":["the","movi","deserv","star","for","the","girl","i","be","sorri","i","be","bia","i","think","pretti","girl","be","the","onli","highlight","of","the","movi","and","for","the","fact","that","it","be","short","than","azumi","i","watch","azumi","and","in","seat","i","amaz","myself","be","abl","to","sit","through","it","br","br","let","talk","about","the","plu","point","of","the","movi","the","girl","ueto","aya","be","cute","that","all","there","be","to","salvag","the","whole","movi","the","fact","be","if","the","main","charact","be","male","i","be","sure","that","much","peopl","includ","me","would","not","have","touch","the","movi","at","all","br","br","now","let","talk","about","the","minu","point","firstli","it","be","real","draggi","with","lot","and","lot","of","repeat","scene","scene","of","nachi","and","azumi","keep","come","back","it","seem","much","like","a","drama","wai","of","shoot","typic","japanes","drama","love","flashback","and","thi","movi","too","secondli","the","movi","be","too","unrealist","in","a","histor","set","i","do","not","mind","unrealist","movi","but","thi","movi","be","like","a","poor","wai","of","show","creativ","by","throw","in","ninja","that","act","like","bear","and","spider","web","etc","it","remind","me","of","shinobi","though","shinobi","be","a","movi","with","a","fantasi","set","moreov","to","portrai","idontknow","what","effect","the","director","film","peopl","dye","with","blood","sprai","liter","all","around","peopl","not","realiz","their","head","be","cut","off","etc","etc","etc","too","mani","of","thi","spoil","the","show","it","seem","like","the","anim","influenc","be","strong","in","thi","movi","it","degrad","the","show","greatli","thirdli","be","not","azumi","suppos","to","be","a","assassin","she","seem","much","like","a","onemanarmi","to","me","just","that","she","be","a","femal","i","do","not","think","you","see","assassin","charg","into","armi","camp","the","onli","time","i","feel","she","act","assassinlik","be","when","she","kill","the","kiyomasa","kato","at","the","end","of","azumi","lastli","the","plot","be","thin","in","both","movi","it","a","linear","plot","with","no","develop","and","surpris","in","ani","wai"],"filtered":["movi","deserv","star","girl","sorri","bia","think","pretti","girl","onli","highlight","movi","fact","short","azumi","watch","azumi","seat","amaz","abl","sit","br","br","let","talk","plu","point","movi","girl","ueto","aya","cute","salvag","whole","movi","fact","main","charact","male","sure","much","peopl","includ","touch","movi","br","br","let","talk","minu","point","firstli","real","draggi","lot","lot","repeat","scene","scene","nachi","azumi","keep","come","back","seem","much","like","drama","wai","shoot","typic","japanes","drama","love","flashback","thi","movi","secondli","movi","unrealist","histor","set","mind","unrealist","movi","thi","movi","like","poor","wai","show","creativ","throw","ninja","act","like","bear","spider","web","etc","remind","shinobi","though","shinobi","movi","fantasi","set","moreov","portrai","idontknow","effect","director","film","peopl","dye","blood","sprai","liter","around","peopl","realiz","head","cut","etc","etc","etc","mani","thi","spoil","show","seem","like","anim","influenc","strong","thi","movi","degrad","show","greatli","thirdli","azumi","suppos","assassin","seem","much","like","onemanarmi","femal","think","see","assassin","charg","armi","camp","onli","time","feel","act","assassinlik","kill","kiyomasa","kato","end","azumi","lastli","plot","thin","movi","linear","plot","develop","surpris","ani","wai"],"filtered2":["deserv","star","girl","sorri","bia","think","pretti","girl","onli","highlight","fact","short","azumi","watch","azumi","seat","amaz","abl","sit","let","talk","plu","point","girl","ueto","aya","cute","salvag","whole","fact","main","charact","male","sure","peopl","includ","touch","let","talk","minu","point","firstli","real","draggi","lot","lot","repeat","scene","scene","nachi","azumi","keep","come","back","seem","like","drama","wai","shoot","typic","japanes","drama","love","flashback","secondli","unrealist","histor","set","mind","unrealist","like","poor","wai","show","creativ","throw","ninja","act","like","bear","spider","web","etc","remind","shinobi","though","shinobi","fantasi","set","moreov","portrai","idontknow","effect","director","peopl","dye","blood","sprai","liter","around","peopl","realiz","head","cut","etc","etc","etc","mani","spoil","show","seem","like","anim","influenc","strong","degrad","show","greatli","thirdli","azumi","suppos","assassin","seem","like","onemanarmi","femal","think","see","assassin","charg","armi","camp","onli","time","feel","act","assassinlik","kill","kiyomasa","kato","end","azumi","lastli","plot","thin","linear","plot","develop","surpris","ani","wai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,7,8,10,11,12,19,21,23,24,27,28,32,33,34,35,43,50,54,58,63,66,72,76,78,80,84,86,97,98,100,106,109,111,117,119,124,134,146,149,179,186,208,238,244,272,277,3

{"value":"Ted V. Mikels's film Corpse Grinders 2 is 103 minutes of excruciating cinematic swill. The plot is pretty much a mixture of nonsensical business dealings among people who grind corpses into cat food while cat aliens, who are losing a war with dog aliens, looking to get some of this cat food. Watching this movie, I began to look for any kind of distraction, anything to reassure myself that I was doing something else besides losing my mind from the inside out.<br /><br />Several scenes go on for far too long, as characters take forever to do simple things. I've heard that Mr. Mikels doesn't like to use jump cuts too often, fearful that they will confuse his audience. I'm not sure if this attitude is \"avant-garde\" or just \"stupid.\" Try as I might, I could not bring myself to care about any of the characters in the unnecessarily huge cast, well with the possible exception of the old men who are the caretakers of the factory. The majority of the cast are a bunch of no-talent amateurs who don't even bother to learn the lyrics to \"Amazing Grace\" before they have to sing it on camera. Although perhaps the blame should go to the poor sound quality, since I only actually heard around 80% of the dialogue while watching the DVD.<br /><br />This is quite possibly the worst film to ever be shot. I've listened to snippets of the commentary,and Mr. Mikels comes off as a surprisingly sweet old man, what the hell was he doing making this kind of trash? I'd like to hear the explanations from the old men who had to lie shirtless on a metal conveyor belt waiting to be ground up. Movies I've long hated suddenly seem a lot better. I long for the intermittedly appropriate music of Excalibur, and the consistent lighting of Dawn of the Dead. I need to go do something, anything.

{"value":"Unfortunately, this has been showing on Star Movies here in Thailand for the last week or so. It's complete rubbish acting. As another member said, this movie is a good example of 'how not to act.' I haven't seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time. The actors (can you call them 'actors'?) are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog. I would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is, you would have to see the movie... but that would be akin to torture.<br /><br />I cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines, and the rest of the cast with their accents (fake or contrived) is equally heinous. Another actress with the fake British accent was pretty, yes, but good lord was her accent terrible. Mix that with her (lack of) acting and you have a disaster. She should just have said nothing and I could have accepted her as the pretty girl. Oh my, we just got to the scene where the leading lady's lover says \"Really me?\" after a forced crying scene from her. Laughable. No, really, I just laughed out loud.<br /><br />The sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film. Some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice (minus the actors).<br /><br />The old magic potion lady? What?! Another member mentioned the 'modern' love song that was in the movie. Totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago.<br /><br />I understand the movie was considered 'Big Budget' in Thailand at the time of it's production. I would be seriously upset if I were the producer of this movie. Just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) film.<br /><br />I would give the King Maker a 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating. 2 out of

{"value":"Yes, I know I'm one of the few people longing to trample this movie into the dust of oblivion.So let me me tell you why I feel this way. In truth,had it been advertized as a Zombie film or the like,I might have enjoyed it.But right now,I'm totally speechless.<br /><br />*SPOILER...Though I'm not sure what's to spoil* Let's start with the first HUGE flaw. If I did not know that the movie is called \"Darkness - The VAMPIRE Version\" and had I not seen some sequences where some individuals seem to be sucking blood, I would not have seen the connection with Vampires. I mean, FANGLESS???? Give me a break!!!<br /><br />Second bad point: what's with the Metal? It appears that all young people, but mainly those so-called \"vampires\", are into various kinds of Metal,judging mainly by their shirts! Don't get me wrong, I've been into the more extreme forms of music for almost 15 years, but nobody 's going to scare me by showing me some ridiculous teenagers in Iron Maiden (of all bands!!!) T-shirts running around,pretending to be Vampires! \"Pathetic\" is the only only word that I could use here.<br /><br />Third weakness: the actors. Wait a minute. WHAT actors?! You mean the director's wooden friends! Words would be a waste here.<br /><br />Yes, alright, the movie is very gory, but what difference does that make? It WOULD have been a strong point and something to enjoy if the \"briliant\" director had not chosen to create an ARTIFICIAL vampire topic in this movie. I wanted to see Vampires,but was treated to some stupid looking kids I would have loved to use my baseball bat on. The Film-makers should simply have advertized the movie saying \"cheap B-grade horror with no plot but a lot of gore\" !!!<br /><br />This movie is blasphemy against the whole concept of Vampirism.

{"value":"The \"math\" aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this TV show apart from the millions of other cop shows. The only redeeming aspect to this show is Rob Morrow, although his career must have been (undeservedly) waning after Northern Exposure if he signed up for this schlock.<br /><br />The lame-ness of the \"math\" aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co-starring Lou Diamond Phillips (which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned.) In order to catch a fugitive, the \"mathematician\" uses some theory about \"bubbles\". So, he gives this long explanation that, if we have seen the suspect in places A, B and C, then we can use \"bubble theory\" to calculate where he might be. He does this all on a chalkboard, or maybe with a stick in the dirt (I cant remember).<br /><br />Anyway, when you look at the finished product, he basically took three spots, and picked a point right in the middle and said \"Ok, mathematically, here's where we are most likely to find the fugitive.\" At which point, one other character points out \"Oh, that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live.\" Is that math? Its not even connect-the-f**k**g-dots!!! This show reminds me of the math major I used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to \"support\" points that every one else had already agreed on through either less-complex analysis or basic common sense.<br /><br />It just goes to show -- When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail. I can't wait til they stick the NUMB3RS team on OSAMA...

{"value":"I admire 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its frankness  pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the lead/director Joe Swanberg. They weren't afraid to show trueness to everyday \"private\" occurrences. Unfortunately, the film falls under the 'The Brown Bunny' realm, though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, it mirrors 'Bunny' with a whole lot of nothing going on, or too many cinematography shots focused (or sincerely unfocused) on absolutely nothing  feet, hands or genitals. Again, unfortunately, I can see why this film was released, and why people are renting: true life sex scenes and full frontal (equally, both male and female) nudity. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time. We quickly learn of a post-college male/female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex-boyfriend. Other than that, we are subjected to the every-day events of their boring lives: she works for her parents; he works on an extremely uninteresting sexual awareness project on his computer. For this all to work, the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real. Neither work and it's as boring as watching someone drive for an hour, i.e. 'The Brown Bunny.' The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich, and even she does some questionable acting. (The DVD extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching/listening to.) Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower-habits, but overall the film falls flat. It has narrations that doesn't fit the scenes, too many boring everyday events and unconvincing acting that you wonder, other than the soft-porn factor, why you rented this.","finished_norm":["i","admir","kiss","on","the","mouth","for","it","frank","pubic","hair","cut","and","masturb","especi","from","the","leaddirector","joe","swanberg","thei","be","not","afraid","to","show","trueness","to","everydai","privat","occurr","unfortun","the","film","fall","under","the","the","brown","bunni","realm","though","with","a","slightli","much","develop","plot","of","jealousi","ye","it","mirror","bunni","with","a","whole","lot","of","noth","go","on","or","too","mani","cinematographi","shot","focu","or","sincer","unfocus","on","absolut","noth","foot","hand","or","genit","again","unfortun","i","can","see","why","thi","film","be","releas","and","why","peopl","be","rent","true","life","sex","scene","and","full","frontal","equal","both","male","and","femal","nuditi","other","than","that","it","be","a","complet","wast","of","time","we","quickli","learn","of","a","postcolleg","malefemal","roommat","pair","in","which","the","male","have","obviou","feel","for","the","femal","that","see","him","a","just","a","friend","while","continu","have","sex","with","her","exboyfriend","other","than","that","we","be","subject","to","the","everydai","event","of","their","bore","live","she","work","for","her","parent","he","work","on","a","extrem","uninterest","sexual","awar","project","on","hi","comput","for","thi","all","to","work","the","dialogu","have","to","be","interest","and","the","act","real","neither","work","and","it","a","bore","a","watch","someon","drive","for","a","hour","ie","the","brown","bunni","the","onli","actor","that","stand","out","be","kate","winterich","and","even","she","doe","some","question","act","the","dvd","extra","with","her","in","front","of","a","mike","be","actual","worth","watchinglisten","to","again","i","admir","the","filmmak","especi","swanberg","for","bare","it","all","and","not","be","afraid","to","expos","themselv","or","showerhabit","but","overal","the","film","fall","flat","it","have","narrat","that","doe","not","fit","the","scene","too","mani","bore","everydai","event","and","unconvinc","act","that","you","wonder","other","than","the","softporn","factor","why","you","rent","thi"],"filtered":["admir","kiss","mouth","frank","pubic","hair","cut","masturb","especi","leaddirector","joe","swanberg","thei","afraid","show","trueness","everydai","privat","occurr","unfortun","film","fall","brown","bunni","realm","though","slightli","much","develop","plot","jealousi","ye","mirror","bunni","whole","lot","noth","go","mani","cinematographi","shot","focu","sincer","unfocus","absolut","noth","foot","hand","genit","unfortun","see","thi","film","releas","peopl","rent","true","life","sex","scene","full","frontal","equal","male","femal","nuditi","complet","wast","time","quickli","learn","postcolleg","malefemal","roommat","pair","male","obviou","feel","femal","see","friend","continu","sex","exboyfriend","subject","everydai","event","bore","live","work","parent","work","extrem","uninterest","sexual","awar","project","hi","comput","thi","work","dialogu","interest","act","real","neither","work","bore","watch","someon","drive","hour","ie","brown","bunni","onli","actor","stand","kate","winterich","even","doe","question","act","dvd","extra","front","mike","actual","worth","watchinglisten","admir","filmmak","especi","swanberg","bare","afraid","expos","themselv","showerhabit","overal","film","fall","flat","narrat","doe","fit","scene","mani","bore","everydai","event","unconvinc","act","wonder","softporn","factor","rent","thi"],"filtered2":["admir","kiss","mouth","frank","pubic","hair","cut","masturb","especi","leaddirector","joe","swanberg","afraid","show","trueness","everydai","privat","occurr","unfortun","fall","brown","bunni","realm","though","slightli","develop","plot","jealousi","ye","mirror","bunni","whole","lot","noth","go","mani","cinematographi","shot","focu","sincer","unfocus","absolut","noth","foot","hand","genit","unfortun","see","releas","peopl","rent","true","life","sex","scene","full","frontal","equal","male","femal","nuditi","complet","wast","time","quickli","learn","postcolleg","malefemal","roommat","pair","male","obviou","feel","femal","see","friend","continu","sex","exboyfriend","subject","everydai","event","bore","live","work","parent","work","extrem","uninterest","sexual","awar","project","comput","work","dialogu","interest","act","real","neither","work","bore","watch","someon","drive","hour","ie","brown","bunni","onli","actor","stand","kate","winterich","even","doe","question","act","dvd","extra","front","mike","actual","worth","watchinglisten","admir","filmmak","especi","swanberg","bare","afraid","expos","themselv","showerhabit","overal","fall","flat","narrat","doe","fit","scene","mani","bore","everydai","event","unconvinc","act","wonder","softporn","factor","rent"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,7,8,11,18,19,21,23,28,32,41,43,48,49,50,52,60,72,75,80,86,89,103,108,111,116,139,161,170,174,175,209,219,222,227,235,247,248,254,267,303,304,320,323,327,329,336

{"value":"I came here for a review last night before deciding which TV movie to settle in front of, and those I found made this one look unmissable. How misled I feel!<br /><br />Firstly, it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife's daytime movie. The performances are wooden, every sentence is an attempt at 'poignant' in the way that housewife's daytime movies and bad soap operas always are, and it is based in that predictable and well-trodden premise that men (particularly soldiers) are essentially violent and incompassionate. The whole movie is about the 'drama' apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension.<br /><br />If that sounds tolerable (or even enjoyable) to you, then be warned. Linda Hamilton's German accent, while quite good, is painfully distracting - as is her face, for some reason. The other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators, with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day. There are few surprises, but do watch for the 'Monty Pythonesque' endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers' knapsacks!<br /><br />I wasn't expecting action, but I had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged. What I got was a particularly bad Christmas 'feelgood' story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all.<br /><br />Watch it under the folowing circumstances: 1: There's nothing else on. 2: You are a fan of predictable 'housewife takes on men and wins' TV movies. 3: The only way you can appreciate a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film. 4: You've imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling.","finished_norm":["i","come","here","for","a","review","last","night","befor","decid","which","tv","movi","to","settl","in","front","of","and","that","i","find","make","thi","on","look","unmiss","how","mislead","i","feelbr","br","firstli","it","ne","to","be","point","out","up","front","that","thi","be","veri","much","a","housewif","daytim","movi","the","perform","be","wooden","everi","sentenc","be","a","attempt","at","poignant","in","the","wai","that","housewif","daytim","movi","and","bad","soap","opera","alwai","be","and","it","be","base","in","that","predict","and","welltrodden","premis","that","man","particularli","soldier","be","essenti","violent","and","incompassion","the","whole","movi","be","about","the","drama","appar","in","the","moment","when","the","male","charact","threaten","to","develop","a","dimensionbr","br","if","that","sound","toler","or","even","enjoy","to","you","then","be","warn","linda","hamilton","german","accent","while","quit","good","be","painfulli","distract","a","be","her","face","for","some","reason","the","other","perform","be","no","doubt","a","endur","sourc","of","embarrass","to","their","perpetr","with","painfulli","thin","and","obviou","character","be","the","order","of","the","dai","there","be","few","surpris","but","do","watch","for","the","monti","pythonesqu","endless","suppli","of","food","and","drink","that","miracul","appear","from","the","hungri","soldier","knapsacksbr","br","i","be","not","expect","action","but","i","have","hope","for","beauti","or","textur","or","emotion","charg","what","i","get","be","a","particularli","bad","christma","feelgood","stori","that","will","have","a","intellig","audienc","cring","with","the","crapul","of","it","allbr","br","watch","it","under","the","folow","circumst","there","noth","els","on","you","be","a","fan","of","predict","housewif","take","on","man","and","win","tv","movi","the","onli","wai","you","can","appreci","a","true","stori","be","when","hollywood","turn","it","into","a","featur","film","you","have","imbib","enough","nog","that","your","emot","be","easili","stir","by","unsophist","storytel"],"filtered":["come","review","last","night","befor","decid","tv","movi","settl","front","find","make","thi","look","unmiss","mislead","feelbr","br","firstli","ne","point","front","thi","veri","much","housewif","daytim","movi","perform","wooden","everi","sentenc","attempt","poignant","wai","housewif","daytim","movi","bad","soap","opera","alwai","base","predict","welltrodden","premis","man","particularli","soldier","essenti","violent","incompassion","whole","movi","drama","appar","moment","male","charact","threaten","develop","dimensionbr","br","sound","toler","even","enjoy","warn","linda","hamilton","german","accent","quit","good","painfulli","distract","face","reason","perform","doubt","endur","sourc","embarrass","perpetr","painfulli","thin","obviou","character","order","dai","surpris","watch","monti","pythonesqu","endless","suppli","food","drink","miracul","appear","hungri","soldier","knapsacksbr","br","expect","action","hope","beauti","textur","emotion","charg","get","particularli","bad","christma","feelgood","stori","intellig","audienc","cring","crapul","allbr","br","watch","folow","circumst","noth","els","fan","predict","housewif","take","man","win","tv","movi","onli","wai","appreci","true","stori","hollywood","turn","featur","film","imbib","enough","nog","emot","easili","stir","unsophist","storytel"],"filtered2":["come","review","last","night","befor","decid","tv","settl","front","find","make","look","unmiss","mislead","feelbr","firstli","ne","point","front","veri","housewif","daytim","perform","wooden","everi","sentenc","attempt","poignant","wai","housewif","daytim","bad","soap","opera","alwai","base","predict","welltrodden","premis","man","particularli","soldier","essenti","violent","incompassion","whole","drama","appar","moment","male","charact","threaten","develop","dimensionbr","sound","toler","even","enjoy","warn","linda","hamilton","german","accent","quit","good","painfulli","distract","face","reason","perform","doubt","endur","sourc","embarrass","perpetr","painfulli","thin","obviou","character","order","dai","surpris","watch","monti","pythonesqu","endless","suppli","food","drink","miracul","appear","hungri","soldier","knapsacksbr","expect","action","hope","beauti","textur","emotion","charg","get","particularli","bad","christma","feelgood","stori","intellig","audienc","cring","crapul","allbr","watch","folow","circumst","noth","els","fan","predict","housewif","take","man","win","tv","onli","wai","appreci","true","stori","hollywood","turn","featur","imbib","enough","nog","emot","easili","stir","unsophist","storytel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,7,9,10,11,15,16,17,31,33,34,38,45,49,66,79,85,93,95,96,105,110,111,120,129,130,132,140,144,168,169,172,176,177,178,181,188,196,197,210,249,251,300,304,305,308,320,325,326,334,337,383,439,463,484,489,497,506,527,557,559,567,583,603,649,657,667,736,

{"value":"In the title I write that the story is ludicrous. below I'll elaborate and tell you why it, in my humble opinion, ruins this movie.<br /><br />Gere and Danes are doing their jobs, and while it's not their best work, it's quite OK. The rest of the cast, though, is doing a really poor job. Mind you, this is not entirely the actors fault. The problem is that Gere and Danes are the only ones that have characters that have even the slightest room in the movie to really give any depth. All other characters have either too little room in the movie to create any depth, or the character is such a cliché that it doesn't matter how hard the actors try.<br /><br />The director has a bit of a Se7en complex, but looking merely at the direction, I think he does an OK job.<br /><br />But the story. This is the kind of script that is bad in two ways. First of all it's a bad movie script. The characters are shallow (except for Gere's and Danes' characters), the villains are clichés and the actions of the characters is totally unbelievable. Besides this, the writers must have an agenda where they want to bring back our views and ethics a hundred years. It's the kind of movie that are saying that some criminals are still criminals, regardless of the fact that they have paid the price the society has given them. It's also the kind of movie that says, albeit only between the lines, that every form of sexual deviance should be punished without trial, judge or jury. And of course, according to the movie, everything that is not sex in the missionary position by a married couple is a sexual deviance.<br /><br />So, if you're going to film school and need an example of a bad script, or if you're writing scripts yourself and want an ego boost.

{"value":"This does give away some of the plot, by the way. A Charlie Brown Christmas is one of those timeless classics that teach you the value Christmas and just enjoying the holiday. This, however, does not. It tries to capture the emotion of A Charlie Brown Christmas, there even is another Christmas play, but fails with lackluster and easy jokes. Charlie Brown is no longer wondering about the spirit of Christmas but is instead wants to buy a present for Peggy Jean ($25 gloves...what?). His sister Sally is the most annoying character in the movie. Here is one of her jokes: Sally wants to write a letter to Santa, but doesn't know how to spell Charlie (for some reason he needs to be in her letter) so instead decides to name him Sam, because she knows how to spell Sam. Also, Sally plays an angel in the play with one word to day: \"Hark!\" She instead says hockey stick (har har). If Sally saying hark 12 times (all oddly sounding exactly the same) doesn't kill you, nothing will. Peppermint Patty and Marcy are a large focal point, but that hardly makes it better. Marcy is funny with her responses to Patty, but Patty is another story. She sounds like a boy (which doesn't dispel the rumors) and gets mad when she has to be the sheep in the play (terrible baas and all). Apparently she is the sheep every year, and is worried she will forget her lines (lines she doesn't have). She is so worried she mentions it twice, one right after the other, and gets the same response. I'm assuming she must have short term memory loss, or something. Lucy and Linus are more welcome (although Linus still has annoying advice), but hardly amount to much air time. I'm sure Schroeder isn't even in this one. All in all, it tries to be a parasite to the original, but compromised the message for a few quick

{"value":"I saw this movie in my international cinema class and was grossed out from get go. This movie is nothing but one scene of blatant shock value after the next.<br /><br />The 4th Man is about an alcoholic writer named Reve, who has visions of his in-pending danger. He meets up with a woman named Christine when giving a lecture at a local book club, and only decides to stay with her when he discovers how attractive her boyfriend is. To put it plainer, Reve likes the Dutch sausage. So Reve concocts a plan to seduce Christine's boyfriend so he can ultimately have sex with him. But its later discovered that Christine has had 3 previous husbands, who she all murdered. Now Reve and Christine's boyfriend could be \"THE 4TH MAN.\" The storyline makes sense with no plot holes. The editing and everything else that is technical about this movie is perfectly fine. The movie is just gross and I felt the need to vomit in some parts. Basically, this isn't my cup of tea.<br /><br />The movie opens with Reve getting out of bed in JUST a t-shirt. So in the very beginning, you get to see Reve's lovely pecker flopping around as he walks around his cramped apartment in a hangover state. Later on he has a dream where his pecker gets cut off by a pair of scissors, and they do show it along with the blood fountain that ensues. Reve fondles a statue of Jesus and has homosexual sex in a mausoleum. Plus there's a lot of blood. More blood than all the Freddy Krueger movies combined.<br /><br />Not that I have anything against \"shocking\" scenes, but this movie is just so blatant when it comes to shocking. The whole movie is revolved around the shock value.<br /><br />So if any of this is your cup of tea, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far far far far far away from this one.

{"value":"Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Basically a man at a horn factory is the fourth to crack, and soon enough Ollie cracks with all the horn noises. He is resting at home with Stan by his side, needing quiet, and the Doctor (James Finlayson) phones to say he is coming over to check on Ollie. After realising plumbing and electricity is muddled up by a cross-eyed repairman, the Doctor comes in for a check-up, and after some tests, he recommends drinking goat's milk and getting some sea air on the ocean. After Stan practises some trumpet playing, hanging out the window by the phone cord and a car crash, he and Ollie to a dock to rent a boat. They keep the boat on the dock trying to milk a goat, and Stan has brought his trumpet! Meanwhile, the newspaper's front page reads that Killer Nick Grainger - Escaped Convict (Richard Cramer) has escaped, and he sneaks onto the boys' boat while they are sleeping, and the goat chews through the boat rope, drifting out to sea. In the morning, the see their location, and the Killer comes out demanding something to eat, and he spots Stan and Ollie making fake food, e.g. string for spaghetti, soap for cheese, belt for bacon, sponge for meatballs, and he forces them to eat it. When Ollie starts choking on something, Stan blows his trumpet to help, and Ollie's rage gets him punching the Killer, and it keeps going till the police arrive, only to have Ollie's rage get them put in prison too. There were the tiniest moments of comedy, but it isn't a great black and white film. \"Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into!\" was number 60 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian.

{"value":"Well, I'll start by admitting I'm not a John Ford fan. (I watched \"The Informer\" only because I'm trying to work my way through a list of the \"greats.\") So if you are, just move along, 'cause you're not going to agree with me.<br /><br />What an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is! I will say that there is a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how few films there are about the Irish Revolution) but, as usual, Ford is determined to bury it under over-acting and cheap sentiment. I suppose it's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less-than-seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the \"talkies\" -- the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue. (Of course, title cards would prevent Ford from restating every bit of emotion six times.) What dialogue there is usually has a \"They're always after me Lucky Charms!\" quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an Irish accent. Of course, as bad as they are, the accents are helpful in reminding us we're in Ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some German expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over. (It feels as if, with an eagle eye, you might see some villagers off to torch Dr. Frankenstein in the background.)<br /><br />Techniques change. Tastes change. So I won't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day. But it's not one of the classics that hold up --- more just \"fair warning\" about the kind of over-simplified malarkey to which Ford was going to devote his

{"value":"Gung Ho was a good idea, however it is to much to ask Americans viewers to understand the dynamics of American jobs and foreign competition.In this movie the main character Hunt Stevenson(Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese auto company to come to America and help his dying Pennslyvania town. Two things come at you.First why would a Japanese company come to America to make cars when they do so ,and so well at that? Secondly can anyone understand that American companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape American labor costs? It makes the film's premise then that the Number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its' top competitors(aside from Germany)and put a plant there as unrealistic. Keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time. But he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but Director Ron Howard can't keep this from becoming a TV movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of Japanese and American relations not withstanding. Gung Ho has a Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley feel to it as the producers of both TV shows made the film and then made the TV version of this movie as well which gives the film its' lightweight feel.The Japanese manager gets to love his American workers and feels he and other Japanese people can learnfrom Americans.His No.2 man Saito who supposedly doesn't like Americans all that much doesn't think so.I would have prefered all the Japanese characters been like Saito than the soft goofball characters they made the Japanese out to be.It would have made the film more interesting.","finished_norm":["gung","ho","be","a","good","idea","howev","it","be","to","much","to","ask","american","viewer","to","understand","the","dynam","of","american","job","and","foreign","competitionin","thi","movi","the","main","charact","hunt","stevensonmichael","keaton","go","to","japan","and","convinc","a","japanes","auto","compani","to","come","to","america","and","help","hi","dye","pennslyvania","town","two","thing","come","at","youfirst","why","would","a","japanes","compani","come","to","america","to","make","car","when","thei","do","so","and","so","good","at","that","secondli","can","anyon","understand","that","american","compani","of","all","typ","go","to","world","nation","to","have","their","product","make","to","escap","american","labor","cost","it","make","the","film","premis","then","that","the","numb","on","maker","of","car","in","the","world","would","go","to","on","of","it","top","competitorsasid","from","germanyand","put","a","plant","there","a","unrealist","keaton","be","still","in","hi","comedi","mode","by","thi","time","but","he","give","a","credibl","perform","all","the","same","a","he","can","prove","that","he","can","go","from","comedi","to","drama","in","a","matt","of","second","and","still","not","embarrass","himself","but","director","ron","howard","ca","not","keep","thi","from","becom","a","tv","movi","which","it","end","up","be","anywai","becaus","thei","have","to","give","the","unlik","stori","a","happi","end","the","polit","and","problem","of","japanes","and","american","relat","not","withstand","gung","ho","have","a","happi","dai","and","lavern","and","shirlei","feel","to","it","a","the","produc","of","both","tv","show","make","the","film","and","then","make","the","tv","version","of","thi","movi","a","good","which","give","the","film","it","lightweight","feelth","japanes","manag","get","to","love","hi","american","worker","and","feel","he","and","other","japanes","peopl","can","learnfrom","americanshi","no","man","saito","who","supposedli","doe","not","like","american","all","that","much","doe","not","think","soi","would","have","prefer","all","the","japanes","charact","be","like","saito","than","the","soft","goofbal","charact","thei","make","the","japanes","out","to","beit","would","have","make","the","film","much","interest"],"filtered":["gung","ho","good","idea","howev","much","ask","american","viewer","understand","dynam","american","job","foreign","competitionin","thi","movi","main","charact","hunt","stevensonmichael","keaton","go","japan","convinc","japanes","auto","compani","come","america","help","hi","dye","pennslyvania","town","two","thing","come","youfirst","japanes","compani","come","america","make","car","thei","good","secondli","anyon","understand","american","compani","typ","go","world","nation","product","make","escap","american","labor","cost","make","film","premis","numb","maker","car","world","go","top","competitorsasid","germanyand","put","plant","unrealist","keaton","still","hi","comedi","mode","thi","time","give","credibl","perform","prove","go","comedi","drama","matt","second","still","embarrass","director","ron","howard","ca","keep","thi","becom","tv","movi","end","anywai","becaus","thei","give","unlik","stori","happi","end","polit","problem","japanes","american","relat","withstand","gung","ho","happi","dai","lavern","shirlei","feel","produc","tv","show","make","film","make","tv","version","thi","movi","good","give","film","lightweight","feelth","japanes","manag","get","love","hi","american","worker","feel","japanes","peopl","learnfrom","americanshi","man","saito","supposedli","doe","like","american","much","doe","think","soi","prefer","japanes","charact","like","saito","soft","goofbal","charact","thei","make","japanes","beit","make","film","much","interest"],"filtered2":["gung","ho","good","idea","howev","ask","american","viewer","understand","dynam","american","job","foreign","competitionin","main","charact","hunt","stevensonmichael","keaton","go","japan","convinc","japanes","auto","compani","come","america","help","dye","pennslyvania","town","two","thing","come","youfirst","japanes","compani","come","america","make","car","good","secondli","anyon","understand","american","compani","typ","go","world","nation","product","make","escap","american","labor","cost","make","premis","numb","maker","car","world","go","top","competitorsasid","germanyand","put","plant","unrealist","keaton","still","comedi","mode","time","give","credibl","perform","prove","go","comedi","drama","matt","second","still","embarrass","director","ron","howard","ca","keep","becom","tv","end","anywai","becaus","give","unlik","stori","happi","end","polit","problem","japanes","american","relat","withstand","gung","ho","happi","dai","lavern","shirlei","feel","produc","tv","show","make","make","tv","version","good","give","lightweight","feelth","japanes","manag","get","love","american","worker","feel","japanes","peopl","learnfrom","americanshi","man","saito","supposedli","doe","l

{"value":"Unfortunately for Sarah Silverman this show doesn't compliment her at all.The character isn't even remotely likable and it's not a situation where you think \"oh she's such i b*tch i love her\" just \"she's such a b*tch\".This character is just a plain old self righteous, mean, b*tch.Sarah seems to struggle to have to carry this show because she's the only semi funny one in it.The mood, the dialogue it's all so damn boring and dry it's like listening to your grandpa go on and on about the marbles he collected as a kid.<br /><br />The Sarah Silverman Program is so unbelievably boring that i was thinking of changing the channel to watch old repeats of Married With children something that is funny because the characters are so \"immoral\" and \"rude\".I'm sorry but i don't find a show packed with dry humour and corny off the wall story lines about some angry, bitter, loser's angry, bitter life with her annoying as hell sister and gay friends who sound like Keanu Reeves with a cold anywhere close to funny.I can't stand this show even though generally i find Sarah Silverman to be that \"I love her cause she's such a b*tch character\" like in School Of Rock, and most of her stand up.I think this show is boring with characters who think being mean and saying and doing things for shock value eg. the constant pube, diarrhea and $hit in general for laughs.The Sarah Silverman program attempts to be funny and fails it either needs a laugh track or better writers.Someone compared it to South Park but it's not even close.I've expressed my opinions on The Sarah Silverman Program and won't become an annoying troll meaning you won't see me being a b*tch and constantly posting stuff like \"This show sucks\" and \"Why isn't this cancelled yet\".I don't like The
