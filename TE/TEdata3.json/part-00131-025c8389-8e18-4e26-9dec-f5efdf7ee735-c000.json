{"value":"Much of \"Over Her Dead Body\" is so painfully unfunny that I was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors.<br /><br />Eva Longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy, and further, that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing. She's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé. The fiancé is played by Paul Rudd, drippy and charmless, while the psychic is played by Lake Bell, bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has. I felt most sorry for Bell, as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work. Unfortunately, she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features Jason Biggs tolerable, and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like Leo DiCaprio at the end of \"Titanic.\" <br /><br />\"Over Her Dead Body\" actually pi**ed me off, because of its laziness and utter lack of effort. I started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this. Seriously, does Hollywood think movies like this are good enough? How stupid do they really think the movie-going public is? <br /><br />Grade:

{"value":"This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train. Previously, we've set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but must rally in the face of attack. I've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn. However, Bruce Cabot's allure is pretty much a mystery to me - he's base and unsubtle in comparison, but I've always felt he'd just emerged, smiling, from under a car, covered in grease and a sixth grade education. Some people like 'em that way, as did Gene's gypsy queen character. This is an action adventure filler, tho, and just as we've been warned of invading locals with guns, ready to sabotage and attack the Brits in their land, there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all. This feature requires nothing more than your barest attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better. It was almost more interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles.

{"value":"Music that grinds on the nerves like fingernails on a blackboard, acting that is so zombielike it was a shame to waste the cast by not making a second movie; casting everyone in it as true zombies---with the cast of Sabrina the Teenaged Witch as the heroes... a movie so downright awful that if \"stoners\" were still around it might be considered a cult movie---but, oh so amateurish, the scripts might as well have been carried around by the actors, their lines read as they slowly shuffled through the movie---banal, illogical sets modeled after LA subdivisions, props straight from ToysRus! Was a movie ever made that is so completely and totally inept??? Logic flies to the wind in this plodding, senseless, pointless and with a \"monster\" so stupid and uncoordinated that it couldn't catch a turtle in an icebox---lowcut, leggy---and amazon! It kept my attention all the way through; the way a terrible, ongoing chain accident in the fog involving multiple vehicles keeps one watching to the very end... as, after a ridiculous ray-gun fight in a prison on another planet, a pneumaticaly-disadvantaged sexy and mentally unbalanced bounty hunter chases a retarded extra-terrestrial fugitive---TO EARTH!

{"value":"In the opening scene of \"Malta Story\" Mr A.Guinness bore such a startling resemblance to Noel Coward that I fully expected his first words to be \"Certain women need striking regularly - like gongs\" or some such world - weary bon mot.Unfortunately his dialogue is hardly deathless prose and even the Master would have had trouble bringing it to life.Indeed Mr Guinness wanders through the picture as if looking for a focal point and failing to find one.And therein lies the fatal weakness of the whole movie.Mr J.Hawkins likewise gives up early on and ends up giving a \"Jack Hawkins\" performance without an ounce of individuality.It could have been spliced from any of a dozen British war movies.Many of the early fifties usual suspects turn up and do their schtick to very little purpose. The Luftwaffe failed to bomb Malta into submission in much the same way as it failed to bring London to its knees.The courage of the Maltese people in the face of incessant danger was recognised by the King and the island was awarded the George Cross.A worthy subject you might think for a movie,but \"Malta Story\" does not even qualify for the term \"worthy\" in its most patronising sense.It gives the appearance of being hastily cobbled together to meet a deadline,perhaps before the actors lost the will to live.","finished_norm":["in","the","open","scene","of","malta","stori","mr","aguin","bear","such","a","startl","resembl","to","noel","coward","that","i","fulli","expect","hi","word","to","be","certain","woman","ne","strike","regularli","like","gong","or","some","such","world","weari","bon","motunfortun","hi","dialogu","be","hardli","deathless","prose","and","even","the","master","would","have","have","troubl","bring","it","to","lifeind","mr","guin","wander","through","the","pictur","a","if","look","for","a","focal","point","and","fail","to","find","oneand","therein","lie","the","fatal","weak","of","the","whole","moviemr","jhawkin","likewis","give","up","earli","on","and","end","up","give","a","jack","hawkin","perform","without","a","ounc","of","individualityit","can","have","be","splice","from","ani","of","a","dozen","british","war","moviesmani","of","the","earli","fifti","usual","suspect","turn","up","and","do","their","schtick","to","veri","littl","purpos","the","luftwaff","fail","to","bomb","malta","into","submiss","in","much","the","same","wai","a","it","fail","to","bring","london","to","it","kneesth","courag","of","the","maltes","peopl","in","the","face","of","incess","danger","be","recognis","by","the","king","and","the","island","be","award","the","georg","crossa","worthi","subject","you","mai","think","for","a","moviebut","malta","stori","doe","not","even","qualifi","for","the","term","worthi","in","it","much","patronis","senseit","give","the","appear","of","be","hastili","cobbl","togeth","to","meet","a","deadlineperhap","befor","the","actor","lose","the","will","to","live"],"filtered":["open","scene","malta","stori","mr","aguin","bear","startl","resembl","noel","coward","fulli","expect","hi","word","certain","woman","ne","strike","regularli","like","gong","world","weari","bon","motunfortun","hi","dialogu","hardli","deathless","prose","even","master","troubl","bring","lifeind","mr","guin","wander","pictur","look","focal","point","fail","find","oneand","therein","lie","fatal","weak","whole","moviemr","jhawkin","likewis","give","earli","end","give","jack","hawkin","perform","without","ounc","individualityit","splice","ani","dozen","british","war","moviesmani","earli","fifti","usual","suspect","turn","schtick","veri","littl","purpos","luftwaff","fail","bomb","malta","submiss","much","wai","fail","bring","london","kneesth","courag","maltes","peopl","face","incess","danger","recognis","king","island","award","georg","crossa","worthi","subject","mai","think","moviebut","malta","stori","doe","even","qualifi","term","worthi","much","patronis","senseit","give","appear","hastili","cobbl","togeth","meet","deadlineperhap","befor","actor","lose","live"],"filtered2":["open","scene","malta","stori","mr","aguin","bear","startl","resembl","noel","coward","fulli","expect","word","certain","woman","ne","strike","regularli","like","gong","world","weari","bon","motunfortun","dialogu","hardli","deathless","prose","even","master","troubl","bring","lifeind","mr","guin","wander","pictur","look","focal","point","fail","find","oneand","therein","lie","fatal","weak","whole","moviemr","jhawkin","likewis","give","earli","end","give","jack","hawkin","perform","without","ounc","individualityit","splice","ani","dozen","british","war","moviesmani","earli","fifti","usual","suspect","turn","schtick","veri","littl","purpos","luftwaff","fail","bomb","malta","submiss","wai","fail","bring","london","kneesth","courag","maltes","peopl","face","incess","danger","recognis","king","island","award","georg","crossa","worthi","subject","mai","think","moviebut","malta","stori","doe","even","qualifi","term","worthi","patronis","senseit","give","appear","hastili","cobbl","togeth","meet","deadlineperhap","befor","actor","lose","live"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,23,24,27,30,33,38,41,46,66,70,79,96,105,110,111,116,125,130,165,170,215,221,242,248,250,251,258,265,266,270,311,314,350,357,379,525,541,550,650,665,680,696,719,752,774,777,794,858,977,978,1004,1053,1056,1059,1079,1092,1242,1323,1337,1367,2028,2465,3075,3183,3964,4167,4336,4398,4870,5014,5027,5199,5232,5298,5442,6001,6138,6595,7580,7941],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,12,14,15,16,17,18,19,23,24,27,30,33,38,41,46,66,70,79,96,105,110,111,116,125,130,165,170,215,221,242,248,250,251,258,265,266,270,311,314,350,357,379,525,541,550,650,665,680,696,719,752,774,777,794,858,977,978,1004,1053,1056,1059,1079,1092,1242,1323,1337,1367,2028,2465,3075,3183,3964,4167,4336,4398,4870,5014,5027,5199,5232,5298,5442,6001,6138,6595,7580,7941],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.852034211452262,1.066

{"value":"First off, the title character is not even the main character of the movie. He is the sidekick of the cult leader. The actor who portrays Igor believed that screaming loud, laughing hysterically, and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people. Igor also had the annoying habit of yelling (because he never actually just spoke) in a high pitched voice. He would also say idiotic one-liners. For example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw, Igor upon seeing this, yells out \"Paul! No Paul! Why'd you do it? I could have cut her clean! So clean!\" In another scene Igor tells a victim that she would have to 'get her own tools for surgery because right now, it was his time to operate.' Aside from the bad acting, the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax, which is Igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed, he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining 'good guys'. The movie offers no explanation of this, only telling the viewer that Igor escaped from the mental hospital. What??? Bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie. I wish I could get back the moments I lost watching

{"value":"This movie is bad. If you are thinking about watching it, there is only one decent scene in the movie, and it lasts about 5 seconds (Amanda Carraway's topless scene). The rest of the movie is horrible. I think high school plays probably have better acting. The plot makes no sense at all. The set was pretty lame, and it wasn't even good to make fun of. It was just dull and very very bad! I watched this on Starz so I thought it had to be at least decent. The mini description sounded like it'd be alright. The girlfriend kills herself for apparently no reason at the beginning of the movie, after you have to watch some horrible music video. The transitions between scenes are VERY abrupt and its like someone just put a ton of clips into a movie without even thinking about how to transition them. Just cuts from one scene to another, no smoothness. Kind of like my random switching from talking about how bad the movie is, to explaining why the plot sucks. The audio gets low at some points, where you can barely hear it, then gets loud with gay 'horror screams' thrown in at random points in the movie. It is the same sound every time.

{"value":"I think the biggest failing something can have is to be boring. Bad is actually better than boring. This thing has no breath. It does have the interesting fact of taking place in Cambodia. How many American made films of the 30's take place in Cambodia. Nevertheless, the conflict there is a little hard to figure out. Even the troop movements are a little confusing. What drags it to a resounding halt is the love story. Why those two guys are so totally transfixed on the dippy blonde I don't know. I thought he should continue to use his Zombies (such as they are) and forget all about her. The movie just plods along. The perfect microcosm is where one of the principle characters follows a Cambodian priest through the water to get to the secret place where the hieroglyphics (or whatever) that explain how to turn people into zombies is kept. I thought they would never get there. One guy takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some columns. He takes two steps. He stops. He looks around. The other guy hides behind some bushes. This is the movie in a nutshell. Then there is the bad acting and insipid dialogue. I actually have a lot of patience when it comes to B movies. This one is insufferable.

{"value":"If this is all the Watchowski's have to offer in terms of a back story to the Matrix, than I really have to question the claims of all of the fans who believe that the movies are intended to register on a deeper level. The second renaissance, while visually stunning & beautiful is, story-wise cliched & ludicrous. How many times have we heard the story of humans relying too much on technology, humans all-too eager to make war, humans basically destroying themselves? There is nothing new here. And I have another question. Considering the plot of the second renaissance, doesn't that make the machines the good guys?! The machines are oppressed for generations by their cruel human overmasters. They fight back, win their freedom and seek to establish a peaceful harmonious coexistence with the humans, who reject them in favor of all-out war, which the cleverer machines naturally win. If this is the back-story, then we shouldn't be rooting for Neo, we should be rooting for the machines! The humans were cruel and oppressive, while the machines were courageous and attepted to be compassionate. Since I do not believe that the Watchowski's intend for us to favor the machines over the humans, I have to believe that the Second Renaissance was simply a misguided attempt @ creating a

{"value":"This movie had the potential to be far more than it was. But it not only fails to deliver, it brings up nauseous self righteous preaching at the same time.<br /><br />John Cusack is even flatter than he was in Midnight of the Garden of Good and Evil. The difference is that this time he is supposed to have an southern accent, which he noticeably loses several times each scene.<br /><br />Al Pacino does his shtick but seems to be walking through this film and collecting a paycheck. He's good as usual but hardly standout.<br /><br />Supporting cast -- throw in female romantic interest which added little, if anything, to the story. Speaking of the story, a convoluted \"who really cares\" tale where Cusack is the self-righteous Mayor's boy who just has to search for \"the right thing\" to be done.<br /><br />People don't act this way. Cusack's character loses all credibility at the end, of which without revealing it, is preach and nauseous. The final scene makes the penultimate silliness seem profound. It's also completely inaccurate but I won't get into law.<br /><br />This is a bad, by the numbers movie. It seems interesting for the first 40 minutes and then it's really a preachy, proselytizing, self-righteous film for the last hour.

{"value":"We laughed our heads off. This script is so incredible you either zap to CNN or go to sleep.<br /><br />My dad was a sea captain for 30 years, he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie.<br /><br />During his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship, the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey/daily and (sorry) s**t on his desk. Of course this was not on a nuclear mission.<br /><br />For instance, the fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. To give a drill at that time is just Hollywood script. When a captain is put under arrest, he IS under arrest, you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept. This is stored within minutes in a well guarded room. He CANNOT escape, it's just like in prison.<br /><br />Funny thing is, my dad also had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman let him pee in the control room. This is not done, ever.

{"value":"I watched this film not really expecting much, I got it in a pack of 5 films, all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could I expect? and you know what I was right, they were all terrible, this movie has a few (and a few is stretching it) interesting points, the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch, the drummer is very like a drummer, i.e damned annoying and, well thats about it actually, the problem is that its just so boring, in what I can only assume was an attempt to build tension, a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious (I had my thumb on the fast forward button, ready to press for most of the movie, but gave it a go) and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking, coz they don't half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot, I thought he looked a bit like a meercat, all this and I haven't even mentioned the killer, I'm not even gonna go into it, its just not worth explaining. Anyway as far as I'm concerned Star and London are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of London (who was actually quite funny) it wasn't because of their acting talent, I've certainly seen a lot worse, but I've also seen a lot better. Best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry.","finished_norm":["i","watch","thi","film","not","realli","expect","much","i","get","it","in","a","pack","of","film","all","of","which","be","pretti","terribl","in","their","own","wai","for","under","a","fiver","so","what","can","i","expect","and","you","know","what","i","be","right","thei","be","all","terribl","thi","movi","have","a","few","and","a","few","be","stretch","it","interest","point","the","occasion","camcord","view","be","a","nice","touch","the","drummer","be","veri","like","a","drummer","ie","damn","annoi","and","good","that","about","it","actual","the","problem","be","that","it","just","so","bore","in","what","i","can","onli","assum","be","a","attempt","to","build","tension","a","whole","lot","of","noth","happen","and","when","it","doe","it","utterli","tediou","i","have","my","thumb","on","the","fast","forward","button","readi","to","press","for","much","of","the","movi","but","give","it","a","go","and","serious","be","the","lead","singer","of","the","band","that","great","look","coz","thei","do","not","half","mention","how","beauti","he","be","a","hell","of","a","lot","i","think","he","look","a","bite","like","a","meercat","all","thi","and","i","have","not","even","mention","the","killer","i","be","not","even","gonna","go","into","it","it","just","not","worth","explain","anywai","a","far","a","i","be","concern","star","and","london","be","just","about","the","onli","reason","to","watch","thi","and","with","the","except","of","london","who","be","actual","quit","funni","it","be","not","becaus","of","their","act","talent","i","have","certainli","see","a","lot","wrong","but","i","have","conjur","see","a","lot","well","well","avoid","unless","your","bore","of","watch","paint","spindri"],"filtered":["watch","thi","film","realli","expect","much","get","pack","film","pretti","terribl","wai","fiver","expect","know","right","thei","terribl","thi","movi","stretch","interest","point","occasion","camcord","view","nice","touch","drummer","veri","like","drummer","ie","damn","annoi","good","actual","problem","bore","onli","assum","attempt","build","tension","whole","lot","noth","happen","doe","utterli","tediou","thumb","fast","forward","button","readi","press","much","movi","give","go","serious","lead","singer","band","great","look","coz","thei","half","mention","beauti","hell","lot","think","look","bite","like","meercat","thi","even","mention","killer","even","gonna","go","worth","explain","anywai","far","concern","star","london","onli","reason","watch","thi","except","london","actual","quit","funni","becaus","act","talent","certainli","see","lot","wrong","conjur","see","lot","well","well","avoid","unless","bore","watch","paint","spindri"],"filtered2":["watch","realli","expect","get","pack","pretti","terribl","wai","fiver","expect","know","right","terribl","stretch","interest","point","occasion","camcord","view","nice","touch","drummer","veri","like","drummer","ie","damn","annoi","good","actual","problem","bore","onli","assum","attempt","build","tension","whole","lot","noth","happen","doe","utterli","tediou","thumb","fast","forward","button","readi","press","give","go","serious","lead","singer","band","great","look","coz","half","mention","beauti","hell","lot","think","look","bite","like","meercat","even","mention","killer","even","gonna","go","worth","explain","anywai","far","concern","star","london","onli","reason","watch","except","london","actual","quit","funni","becaus","act","talent","certainli","see","lot","wrong","conjur","see","lot","well","well","avoid","unless","bore","watch","paint","spindri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,11,12,13,15,16,18,20,21,22,25,26,30,33,39,49,51,52,60,62,66,72,78,94,95,100,101,108,111,120,121,130,154,157,166,167,177,206,219,232,252,262,271,276,285,312,325,335,371,386,389,394,395,460,477,542,699,745,816,868,874,887,889,920,927,1092,1099,1220,1240,1334,1351,1416,1447,1453,1507,1964,2349,2549,2888],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,11,12,13,15,16,18,20,21,22,25,26,30,33,39,49,51,52,60,62,66,72,78,94,95,100,101,108,111,120,121,130,154,157,166,167,177,206,219,232,252,262,271,276,285,312,325,335,371,386,389,394,395,460,477,542,699,745,816,868,874,887,889,920,927,1092,1099,1220,1240,1334,1351,1416,1447,1453,1507,1964,2349,2549,2888],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,1.9416538289407692,2.8828493162168796,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,

{"value":"Siskel & Ebert were terrific on this show whether you agreed with them or not because of the genuine conflict their separate professional opinions generated. Roeper took this show down a notch or two because he wasn't really a film critic and because he substituted snide for opinionated. Now, when Ben Lyons comes on I feel like I'm watching \"Teen News\" -- you know, that kids' news show, hosted by kids for kids? Manckiewitz is not much better. It's obvious they've encountered only a steady diet of mainstream films their entire lives. The idea that these two rank amateurs have anything of interest or consequence to say about motion pictures is ludicrous. If they are reviewing a non-formula film, they are completely lost. Show them something original and intelligent -- they just find it \"confusing\". Wait -- I think I get it ... ABC is owned by Disney ... Disney makes movies for kids. While Siskel, Ebert, and Roper promoted independent films and were only hit-or-miss with the big budget studio productions -- what a surprise: these two guys LOVE the big studio schlock and only manage to tolerate a few indies. Plus everyone knows the age group TV advertisers are aiming for. The blatant nepotism is the icing on the cake.

{"value":"This is, without a doubt, the single worst movie ever created. There's no arguing here. This is it. End of story. The story is juvenile and sub-moronic, looking like it was created by a three-year-old fascinated with dinosaurs. The entire concept is just plain dumb. It's inconceivable how someone could possibly come up with something so stupid and think it was entertaining. The jokes are also completely lame. If you haven't seen this movie yet, consider yourself lucky. If your morbidly curious as to how bad this movie is, please don't make me describe it. Words can't express how completely awful this movie is. This isn't just bad as in being a bad movie. Even those have cohesion, if not entertainment value. This. . . This is. . . Ugh! Think of the worst story ever told and multiply its badness level by 5,000, and you still haven't come close to how awful this movie is. After giving Pokemon the Movie one point, giving this movie one point seems like nothing short of charity. That's how bad it is. Did the producers and directors even take film classes? Because this is a perfect example of how not to make a film. It looks like some amateur high on paint thinner made this film. If you rented this, please take it back and ask for a refund.

{"value":"When I was kid back in the 1970s a local theatre had Children's Matinees every Saturday and Sunday afternoon (anybody remember those?). They showed this thing one year around Christmas time. Me and some friends went to see it. I expected a cool Santa Claus movie. What I got was a terribly dubbed (you can tell) and truly creepy movie.<br /><br />Something about Santa Claus and Merlin the Magician (don't ask me what those two are doing in the same movie) fighting Satan (some joker in a silly devil costume complete with horns!). The images had me cringing in my seat. I always found Santa spooky to begin with so that didn't help. The guy in the Satan suit didn't help. But what REALLY horrified me were the wooden rein deers that pulled Santa's sled. When he wound them up and the creepy sound they made and the movements--I remember having nightmares about those things! All these years later I still remember walking out of that theatre more than a little disturbed by what I saw. My friends were sort of frightened by it too. I just saw an ad for it on TV and ALL those nightmares came roaring back. This is a creepy, disturbing little Christmas film that will probably scare the pants off any little kid who sees it. Avoid this one--unless you really want to punish your kids.

{"value":"Ugh, what can I say other than, ugh. I rented this film because it was labeled as a sequel to the original Vampires. This movie could not have been any lamer. Lacking not only in plot, but the acting is atrocious. Combined with some obvious plot holes makes this movie a very hard one to watch. Many times I questioned my own sanity at continuing to watch the film long after the plot had jumped the shark. Here's a sampling of the lamer aspects...<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Professional \"Slayer\" insists on sleeping outdoors by himself at night. He wakes up to a woman crying, sitting no more than 3 feet from him in the middle of nowhere. He immediately goes to comfort her without questioning her sudden appearance.

{"value":"\"American Nightmare\" is officially tied, in my opinion, with \"It's Pat!\" for the WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.<br /><br />Seven friends (oddly resembling the K-Mart version of the cast of \"Friends\") gather in a coffee shop to listen to American Nightmare, a pirate radio show. It's hosted by a guy with a beard. That's the most exciting aspect of his show.<br /><br />Chandler, Monica, Joey, and... oh wait, I mean, Wayne, Jessie, and the rest of the bad one-liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded DJ. Unbeknownst to them, a crazed nurse/serial killer is listening...<br /><br />Crazy Nurse then proceeds to torture Ross and Rachel and... wait, sorry again... by making their fears come to life. These fears include such stunners as \"voodoo\" and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures.<br /><br />No. Really.<br /><br />This movie was, in a word, rotten. Crazy Nurse's killing spree lacks motivation, there's nothing to make the viewer \"jump,\" the ending blows, and--again--voodoo?<br /><br />If you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones, rent

{"value":"If you haven't seen the gong show TV series then you won't like this movie much at all, not that knowing the series makes this a great movie. <br /><br />I give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems.<br /><br />1) It's a funny snapshot of the era it was made in, the late 1970's and early 1980's. 2) You get a lot of funny cameos of people you've seen on the show. 3) It's interesting to see Chuck (the host) when he isn't doing his on air TV personality. 4) You get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the TV show.<br /><br />I won't list all the bad things because there's a lot of them, but here's a few of the most prominent.<br /><br />1) The Gong Show Movie has a lot of the actual TV show clips which gets tired at movie length. 2) The movie's story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point. 3) Chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor, but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970's flatness.<br /><br />It's a good movie to watch when you don't have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once.

{"value":"The comedic might of Pryor and Gleason couldn't save this dog from the tissue-thin plot, weak script, dismal acting, and laughable continuity in editing this mess together. It has a very few memorable moments, but the well dries up quickly. As a kid I remember this as a Luke-warm vehicle for the two actor-comedians, but there was always something strange about the flow and feeling of what was being conveyed in each scene and how this ties to the plot overall. Watching it again after many years, it screams schlock-a-mania. I'm not so concerned with the racial controversy, as I wouldn't mind seeing a movie take that issue on with a little levity. The most obvious fault to me is that the scenes are laid out like a jumbled, non-related series of 2 minute situation comedy bits (any not very good ones at that), that were stapled together by the editor after an all-nighter at the local watering hole. Characters change feelings and motivations on a dime, without rhyme nor reason, between scenes and within scenes, making this feel as though no one had any idea of what to get out of the screenplay. Not that it was any gem to start with. I feel bad for the two actors whose legacy is marred by this disaster that should never have been made.

{"value":"Don't be deceived as I was by the 'glowing' reviews quoted on the DVD box. \"Wildly entertaining.\", \"a seriously scary freakout.\", and the worst of all, \"ON PAR WITH JAWS.\" This movie is none of the above.<br /><br />Normally I don't bother with writing bad reviews for films but I can't believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on IMDb. It doesn't deserve it.<br /><br />After a so-so opening daylight attack by a monster created by, what else, chemicals dumped by lazy scientists, this movie goes absolutely nowhere and it goes there sloooowly. Basically and improbably, a girl is snagged by the monster (I'll give them points for a good creature design but this ain't no WETA creation) and her semi-comical family spend an hour-and-a-half tracking her down...in the sewers surrounding the Han river. Their search lacks any suspense-again, someone called this on par with Jaws?-and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much pointless. Other than that, a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop.<br /><br />Blech.

{"value":"I really tried to like this movie but in the end it just didn't work for me. I have seen most of Kitamura's output and have found it to be very variable. Alive, like all of his films has an interesting plot, some nifty sequences and a fair amount of creativity. However, these qualities are in painfully short supply in Alive. The plot is cool if not all that original and could have made for a pretty ace film. Unfortunately, the pacing is painfully slow and the film takes an age to get going, before reaching fairly predictable places. The action is just about passable, with the final fight pretty cool, and the earlier one about OK. The earlier one is also marred by overspeedy camera-work, making for less coherency. There are some neat visual effects and some interesting ideas floating around in the dialogue but the film still drags badly. The characters are neither well fleshed out nor well acted and the setting and general color scheme is drab and boring. The film is not completely terrible and has some points of interest, perhaps judicious use of the fast forward button could improve it. With about twenty minutes taken off the run time this could be a pretty decent sci fi thriller. But the full length film is dull. Only recommended to very patient and determined Kitumura fans.","finished_norm":["i","realli","try","to","like","thi","movi","but","in","the","end","it","just","do","not","work","for","me","i","have","see","much","of","kitamura","output","and","have","find","it","to","be","veri","variabl","aliv","like","all","of","hi","film","have","a","interest","plot","some","nifti","sequenc","and","a","fair","amount","of","creativ","howev","thi","qualiti","be","in","painfulli","short","suppli","in","aliv","the","plot","be","cool","if","not","all","that","origin","and","can","have","make","for","a","pretti","ac","film","unfortun","the","pace","be","painfulli","slow","and","the","film","take","a","ag","to","get","go","befor","reach","fairli","predict","place","the","action","be","just","about","passabl","with","the","final","fight","pretti","cool","and","the","earli","on","about","okai","the","earli","on","be","conjur","mar","by","overspeedi","camerawork","make","for","littl","coher","there","be","some","neat","visual","effect","and","some","interest","idea","float","around","in","the","dialogu","but","the","film","still","drag","badli","the","charact","be","neither","good","flesh","out","nor","good","act","and","the","set","and","gener","color","scheme","be","drab","and","bore","the","film","be","not","complet","terribl","and","have","some","point","of","interest","perhap","judici","us","of","the","fast","forward","button","can","improv","it","with","about","twenti","minut","take","off","the","run","time","thi","can","be","a","pretti","decent","sci","fi","thriller","but","the","full","length","film","be","dull","onli","recommend","to","veri","patient","and","determin","kitumura","fan"],"filtered":["realli","try","like","thi","movi","end","work","see","much","kitamura","output","find","veri","variabl","aliv","like","hi","film","interest","plot","nifti","sequenc","fair","amount","creativ","howev","thi","qualiti","painfulli","short","suppli","aliv","plot","cool","origin","make","pretti","ac","film","unfortun","pace","painfulli","slow","film","take","ag","get","go","befor","reach","fairli","predict","place","action","passabl","final","fight","pretti","cool","earli","okai","earli","conjur","mar","overspeedi","camerawork","make","littl","coher","neat","visual","effect","interest","idea","float","around","dialogu","film","still","drag","badli","charact","neither","good","flesh","good","act","set","gener","color","scheme","drab","bore","film","complet","terribl","point","interest","perhap","judici","us","fast","forward","button","improv","twenti","minut","take","run","time","thi","pretti","decent","sci","fi","thriller","full","length","film","dull","onli","recommend","veri","patient","determin","kitumura","fan"],"filtered2":["realli","try","like","end","work","see","kitamura","output","find","veri","variabl","aliv","like","interest","plot","nifti","sequenc","fair","amount","creativ","howev","qualiti","painfulli","short","suppli","aliv","plot","cool","origin","make","pretti","ac","unfortun","pace","painfulli","slow","take","ag","get","go","befor","reach","fairli","predict","place","action","passabl","final","fight","pretti","cool","earli","okai","earli","conjur","mar","overspeedi","camerawork","make","littl","coher","neat","visual","effect","interest","idea","float","around","dialogu","still","drag","badli","charact","neither","good","flesh","good","act","set","gener","color","scheme","drab","bore","complet","terribl","point","interest","perhap","judici","us","fast","forward","button","improv","twenti","minut","take","run","time","pretti","decent","sci","fi","thriller","full","length","dull","onli","recommend","veri","patient","determin","kitumura","fan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,8,10,11,13,14,15,21,24,31,32,36,38,39,48,56,59,60,64,66,69,78,79,98,103,106,108,109,113,123,129,137,140,156,164,166,191,225,227,233,248,266,272,298,309,318,319,336,337,349,367,390,442,448,481,542,546,635,699,714,718,764,771,819,875,877,934,1048,1117,1125,1241,1344,1574,1651,1850,1914,2100,2386,2405,2435,2549,2648,2825,2944,3064,4018,4084,4386,4663,6870,6926,7736],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,8,10,11,13,14,15,21,24,31,32,36,38,39,48,56,59,60,64,66,69,78,79,98,103,106,108,109,113,123,129,137,140,156,164,166,191,225,227,233,248,266,272,298,309,318,319,336,337,349,367,390,442,448,481,542,546,635,699,714,718,764,771,819,875,877,934,1048,1117,1125,1241,1344,1574,1651,1850,1914,2100,2386,2405,2435,2549,2648,2825,2944,3064,4018,4084,4386,4663,6870,6926,7736],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9708

{"value":"I'm a big fan of Westerns but this one.... whew, what a stinker! I think what turned me off almost right off the bat was the inane dialog. I think I could have written better dialog than this when I was in eighth grade. And the poor actors! Given this terrible dialog, none of them came across looking anything but ridiculous. Really, I'm not kidding. Some of this is little better than what you'd get in an Ed Wood film. <br /><br />The biggest tragedy is Sterling Hayden. He was probably THE \"big\" star in this movie which if you called it a B-Western, you'd be lavishing praise upon it. This is what should be called a B-minus Western perhaps. Pity Sterling Hayden, who appeared at other times along with Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Frank Sinatra, and other major talents. For him to appear in a vehicle this poor must have been something he tried to downplay for the rest of his life.<br /><br />One annoying thing about this movie is all the men look like they haven't shaved in a week and their faces are all greasy. I know in the old West guys weren't always well groomed but to a man this is a movie that makes you want to just go 'EWWWW!' Really, this is a crummy Western.

{"value":"Steven Seagal movies have never been Oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse.<br /><br />This one starts with Seagal getting picked up by the FBI because he killed a few people 'in self defence' he's active military so is saved from jail to rescue a stolen Stealth plane that will be used by the cliché 'evil English villain' that Hollywood is so obsessed with including these days.<br /><br />Suffice to say the film has terrible dialog that is almost always delivered with a hefty topping of cheese and lack of acting talent. The story isn't interesting and there are segments of it which make absolutely no sense and do not add anything to the story, characters of movie as a whole such as the 'lesbian' interaction between the two main females in the cast which is there purely for titilation to get viewers and yet isn't even titilating just confusing as it makes no sense as to why it happened when it didn't need to.<br /><br />In short a terrible script with bad dialog, delivered by sub-par actors, boring and at times badly choreographed action scenes, and non-relevant parts that only serve to achieve the near-impossible and make the movie even worse.<br /><br />Save 98 minutes of your life and give this miss, even if you are Seagal's most ardent

{"value":"Unlike many, I don't find the premise or theme of this show the least bit offensive. Its execution, however, is another matter entirely. Like so many B-minus movies, all the decent gags appear to have been spliced into the trailers. For most of the 22-or-so minutes we sit in waning anticipation any morsel of real humor. Or at least something to keep one from fidgeting with the remote or counting carpet fibers. With a couple of exceptions the acting is awful; the comical over-emoting and gesticulating of some cast members might be well suited to a late-night infomercial, but not a primetime sitcom (even a Canadian one.) Notwithstanding the admittedly original cultural angle, I cannot help but think this is mainly a misfired shot by the CBC to replicate the success of Corner Gas. Unfortunately, they got the tone -- and the script -- completely wrong for the prairies. The final insult is that they apparently couldn't even afford to have the location work done in an actual small town (Why? are they so hard to find in Saskatchewan?) Did they think the audience would be fooled by the downtown Regina exteriors? As a proud Canadian I hope this thing goes away soon, and that the rest of the world, primed by the CBC's publicists, quickly forgets this colossal embarrassment of a sitcom.","finished_norm":["unlik","mani","i","do","not","find","the","premis","or","theme","of","thi","show","the","littl","bite","offens","it","execut","howev","be","anoth","matt","entir","like","so","mani","bminu","movi","all","the","decent","gag","appear","to","have","be","splice","into","the","trailer","for","much","of","the","orso","minut","we","sit","in","wane","anticip","ani","morsel","of","real","humor","or","at","littl","someth","to","keep","on","from","fidget","with","the","remot","or","count","carpet","fiber","with","a","coupl","of","except","the","act","be","aw","the","comic","overemot","and","gesticul","of","some","cast","member","mai","be","good","suit","to","a","latenight","infomerci","but","not","a","primetim","sitcom","even","a","canadian","on","notwithstand","the","admittedli","origin","cultur","angl","i","cannot","help","but","think","thi","be","mainli","a","misfir","shoot","by","the","cbc","to","replic","the","success","of","corner","ga","unfortun","thei","get","the","tone","and","the","script","complet","wrong","for","the","prairi","the","final","insult","be","that","thei","appar","can","not","even","afford","to","have","the","locat","work","do","in","a","actual","small","town","why","be","thei","so","hard","to","find","in","saskatchewan","do","thei","think","the","audienc","would","be","fool","by","the","downtown","regina","exterior","a","a","proud","canadian","i","hope","thi","thing","go","awai","soon","and","that","the","rest","of","the","world","prime","by","the","cbc","publicist","quickli","forget","thi","coloss","embarrass","of","a","sitcom"],"filtered":["unlik","mani","find","premis","theme","thi","show","littl","bite","offens","execut","howev","anoth","matt","entir","like","mani","bminu","movi","decent","gag","appear","splice","trailer","much","orso","minut","sit","wane","anticip","ani","morsel","real","humor","littl","someth","keep","fidget","remot","count","carpet","fiber","coupl","except","act","aw","comic","overemot","gesticul","cast","member","mai","good","suit","latenight","infomerci","primetim","sitcom","even","canadian","notwithstand","admittedli","origin","cultur","angl","help","think","thi","mainli","misfir","shoot","cbc","replic","success","corner","ga","unfortun","thei","get","tone","script","complet","wrong","prairi","final","insult","thei","appar","even","afford","locat","work","actual","small","town","thei","hard","find","saskatchewan","thei","think","audienc","fool","downtown","regina","exterior","proud","canadian","hope","thi","thing","go","awai","soon","rest","world","prime","cbc","publicist","quickli","forget","thi","coloss","embarrass","sitcom"],"filtered2":["unlik","mani","find","premis","theme","show","littl","bite","offens","execut","howev","anoth","matt","entir","like","mani","bminu","decent","gag","appear","splice","trailer","orso","minut","sit","wane","anticip","ani","morsel","real","humor","littl","someth","keep","fidget","remot","count","carpet","fiber","coupl","except","act","aw","comic","overemot","gesticul","cast","member","mai","good","suit","latenight","infomerci","primetim","sitcom","even","canadian","notwithstand","admittedli","origin","cultur","angl","help","think","mainli","misfir","shoot","cbc","replic","success","corner","ga","unfortun","get","tone","script","complet","wrong","prairi","final","insult","appar","even","afford","locat","work","actual","small","town","hard","find","saskatchewan","think","audienc","fool","downtown","regina","exterior","proud","canadian","hope","thing","go","awai","soon","rest","world","prime","cbc","publicist","quickli","forget","coloss","embarrass","sitcom"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,12,14,21,25,27,28,29,38,46,48,50,52,53,59,69,73,77,80,92,103,113,117,134,138,154,155,156,165,168,170,171,181,185,198,226,227,232,244,253,308,309,363,369,372,408,449,450,480,484,532,534,556,615,618,662,709,770,775,880,883,884,885,950,967,998,1057,1145,1210,1293,1864,1882,1884,2190,2222,2270,2419,2663,2667,4208,4398,4917,4968,5623,6088,6169,6545,6983,7055,7323,7420,8308,8401],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,12,14,21,25,27,28,29,38,46,48,50,52,53,59,69,73,77,80,92,103,113,117,134,138,154,155,156,165,168,170,171,181,185,198,226,227,232,244,253,308,309,363,369,372,408,449,450,480,484,532,534,556,615,618,662,709,770,775,880,883,884,885,950,967,998,1057,1145,1210,1293,1864,1882,1884,2190,2222,2270,2419,2663,2667,4208,4398,4917,4968,5623,6088,6169,6545,6983,7055,7323,7420,8308,8401],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,2.13345722

{"value":"I just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget, now my take on things.<br /><br />The CGI monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes weren't even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all. When the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro. In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets. They may not look as fancy but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jacksons early films.<br /><br />As for the acting Beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where.<br /><br />The script seemed confused to me. One minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club Shakespeare speech. I'm not say it should be all 'ye' and 'that it be' but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person.<br /><br />I did notice one part near the start when Beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents.<br /><br />In short, this film is a very slightly polished turd, but a turn none the

{"value":"The film is a collection of cliche's on just about anything out there. It has no focus whatsoever, no goals, no real message. Symbolism is pushed over the top and stereotyping is abundant and outrageous. This movie can't resist the temptation of making drama where non exists. Every small exchange of words turns immediately into a lengthy, unjustified dialog that is so typical of an acting class rehearsal. Where there is no substance to this exchange, the actors (regardless of how good they are normally) can't help but compensate with exaggerated emotion, aka \"raising the stakes\". Over acting, to put it simply. The directing is of no help here. Nothing can save this non-story. It is forced, faked and boring to tears. Inaccuracies in portaraying punk rock with The Who, piercings and flashy 90's outfits. Characters wander without a role, detail and motive. Locations are arbitrary. This is Boogie Nights cum The Good Fellas cum Saturday Night Fever, with meaning and art ripped out.<br /><br />Good DP. I'll give it that.<br /><br />Some films have flaws. This film is Lee's flaw.

{"value":"Shame on Yash Raj films and Aditya Chopra who seems to have lost their intelligence over the years and providing steady fare of tripe in this piece of cinematic crap thats not even worth You Tube standards. I was gritting my teeth throughout the whole flick start to finish with the schizophrenic direction, plot line that never quite materialized and on the last scene I just felt ashamed that my country and its crorepati film makers can \"THROW AWAY\" crores on such stupidity. Shame on the actors for taking this work and even commenting on it as some piece of work they can own up to. Saif Ali Khan -completely disappointed in your choice of film. Kareen shows enough skin for the puberty stricken and Akshay comes up as the dim-wit. Anil another retard with a pubescent fascination for English. His cronies were commendable in their acting and with the bizarre cinematography scattered in the last 15 minutes, it was enough to pop a blood vessel.

{"value":"Not only does this movie have a poor plot, bad direction, and terrible acting, its opens up a whole new meaning to racism.<br /><br />In this film \"White\" chicks are the sluts, \"White\" boys are the wana-be gangsters, and successful (yes again) \"White\" businessmen are revolting toilet shitters.<br /><br />I just wonder what would happen if I made the exact same movie with the exact same story line and script, only I made it about Caucasians. \"He dude, its good to finally see your've stopped dating those black chicks\".<br /><br />Nobody seems to notice it, but watch this film again and you'll vomit at how they have portrayed the new Zealand \"white boys\". All of a sudden its white folks who are the main cause of gang aggression, and whores out for a quick bang. Only Samoans girls have a heart, there's no such thing as a non-slutty white girl.<br /><br />It disgusts me that they couldn't make this film without giving the Caucasian community in New Zealand a repulsive profile. If you think I'm overgeneralizing, go watch this film, and see what you make of the \"white boys\". Just because Samoans choose to call us \"white boys\" in actual life, doesn't mean its funny.

{"value":"Being a big fan of Corman's horror movies I expected from his western a bit more than I got. Well, I was entertained all right. I had almost as many laughs as watching Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles.<br /><br />See the spectacle of mobile tire tracks on the prairie of the old west. You can kill time by counting them if there happens to be an otherwise boring scene going on. And the horses seem to have gears in them too, considered the fast-forward chases. See also the swinging bar room queens of the traditional wild west saloon doing a number that reminds of a certain fashionable dance from 1920's, here decades before the style was invented. Hope the saloon around them won't crumple.<br /><br />In the middle of all this mayhem the main actors do a decent job. Ireland, Garland and Hayes are all truly fine. A special praise for them for doing the best they could with the material that seems mostly having been lifted from 'Johnny Guitar', but doesn't quite impress the same way. But there is really nothing wrong with a laughable western like this. Just like a really bad old horror movie, it might fail one way but succeeds to give joy anyway. That is one of the reasons Corman's work appeals to me and that is why I dare to recommend you to experience this movie if you get the

{"value":"Let's see where to begin... bad acting; I'm not sure if I'd even call it that, as it more along the lines of a no-effort script read. The actors didn't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless. Sure there was a scene or two with nudity, but that couldn't save this movie from it's lifeless characters.<br /><br />To call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do. The lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants.<br /><br />Budget? Did this movie even have a budget? It seemed like they used less money than I've seen in a home-shot YouTube video. Bad lighting, props, poor sound post production. Bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them that. Story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so, but there was no life to this flick; I don't care who directed it.<br /><br />I've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom. Don't waste your time or you'll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review. Check the ratings, you'll see the 1's are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10's with hardly anything in between.

{"value":"\"I Am Curious: Yellow\" is a risible and pretentious steaming pile. It doesn't matter what one's political views are because this film can hardly be taken seriously on any level. As for the claim that frontal male nudity is an automatic NC-17, that isn't true. I've seen R-rated films with male nudity. Granted, they only offer some fleeting views, but where are the R-rated films with gaping vulvas and flapping labia? Nowhere, because they don't exist. The same goes for those crappy cable shows: schlongs swinging in the breeze but not a clitoris in sight. And those pretentious indie movies like The Brown Bunny, in which we're treated to the site of Vincent Gallo's throbbing johnson, but not a trace of pink visible on Chloe Sevigny. Before crying (or implying) \"double-standard\" in matters of nudity, the mentally obtuse should take into account one unavoidably obvious anatomical difference between men and women: there are no genitals on display when actresses appears nude, and the same cannot be said for a man. In fact, you generally won't see female genitals in an American film in anything short of porn or explicit erotica. This alleged double-standard is less a double standard than an admittedly depressing ability to come to terms culturally with the insides of women's

{"value":"Imagine that you are asked by your date what movie you wanted to see, and you remember seeing a rather intriguing trailer about \"The Grudge.\" So, in good faith, you recommend seeing that movie. It is the Halloween season, after all. And it did boffo box office this past weekend, so it must be pretty good...so you go.<br /><br />And you're actually in a state of shock when the movie ends the way it does, and you hear yourself audibly saying, \"that can't be the end of the movie....\" But, alas, it is. <br /><br />And imagine coming out of the movie theater being embarrassed and ashamed for recommending such a dog of a movie. You think that your date thinks you're a bonehead for suggesting such an atrocity, and your suggestion will certainly end a promising relationship. Actually, it was so bad that both of us cracked up laughing at how bad it was. I see no future for Miss Gellar in the movies, and suggest that she sticks to television in the future. Actually, it won't be long before she is consigned to flea-market conventions selling Buffy memorabilia, and it can't happen soon enough, if you ask me. Horrible, horrible, horrible.

{"value":"You will recognize the plot immediately. Daughters of a divorced couple trying to get Mom and Dad back together again. Yes, that was the theme of The Parent Trap in the 60s, 80s and 90s. But here's the spooky thing. Even though Deanna Durbin was younger than the 21 year old Hayley Mills while playing the doting daughter(s) roles, Durbin looks much older, as in adult. And so do all of her so-called siblings. <br /><br />And this confusion between adult and child goes throughout the film. The girls are dressed in cute little sailor outfits but look ridiculous in them as the director seems to take pains to point out their ample tops and tushies throughout the film. So you're constantly torn between thinking of them as children or women. When Ray Milland and others start \"hitting on\" them you get the feeling as if they're pedophiles, and you might be one, too for noticing those tushies and tops the director was pointing out. Teens or temptresses, little girls or little foxes, you are never quite sure what you're supposed to be thinking of them as.<br /><br />The parents, too, seem very old and the whole film seems very
