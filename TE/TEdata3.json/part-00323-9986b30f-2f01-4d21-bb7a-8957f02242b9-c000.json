{"value":"I do not envy Barry Levinson, Rachel Weisz, Ben Stiller or Jack Black for doing this film. It's, in one word, boring. Maybe the fact that is too predictable, the more-than-exploited Ben Stiller's loser role or the not-at-all funny scenes make this film just something to forget. Even Christopher Walken's appearance finishes in a pathetic way. I was very disappointed. I love Ben Stiller's acting. I loved it in most of his films, the last one I saw before this was Duplex with Drew Barrymore and was not that bad. About Jack Black... Well, apart from High Fidelity I've never seen him doing something good. What about School of Rock? Ooops, frightening.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","envi","barri","levinson","rachel","weisz","ben","still","or","jack","black","for","do","thi","film","it","in","on","word","bore","mayb","the","fact","that","be","too","predict","the","morethanexploit","ben","still","loser","role","or","the","notatal","funni","scene","make","thi","film","just","someth","to","forget","even","christoph","walken","appear","finish","in","a","pathet","wai","i","be","veri","disappoint","i","love","ben","still","act","i","love","it","in","much","of","hi","film","the","last","on","i","see","befor","thi","be","duplex","with","draw","barrymor","and","be","not","that","bad","about","jack","black","good","apart","from","high","fidel","i","have","never","see","him","do","someth","good","what","about","school","of","rock","ooop","frighten"],"filtered":["envi","barri","levinson","rachel","weisz","ben","still","jack","black","thi","film","word","bore","mayb","fact","predict","morethanexploit","ben","still","loser","role","notatal","funni","scene","make","thi","film","someth","forget","even","christoph","walken","appear","finish","pathet","wai","veri","disappoint","love","ben","still","act","love","much","hi","film","last","see","befor","thi","duplex","draw","barrymor","bad","jack","black","good","apart","high","fidel","never","see","someth","good","school","rock","ooop","frighten"],"filtered2":["envi","barri","levinson","rachel","weisz","ben","still","jack","black","word","bore","mayb","fact","predict","morethanexploit","ben","still","loser","role","notatal","funni","scene","make","someth","forget","even","christoph","walken","appear","finish","pathet","wai","veri","disappoint","love","ben","still","act","love","last","see","befor","duplex","draw","barrymor","bad","jack","black","good","apart","high","fidel","never","see","someth","good","school","rock","ooop","frighten"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,9,15,19,21,33,42,53,54,62,64,79,97,108,128,144,163,169,187,211,229,258,296,337,373,572,573,576,582,601,777,854,1162,1525,1708,2322,2401,2796,3815,4969,5387,6190,7439],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,9,15,19,21,33,42,53,54,62,64,79,97,108,128,144,163,169,187,211,229,258,296,337,373,572,573,576,582,601,777,854,1162,1525,1708,2322,2401,2796,3815,4969,5387,6190,7439],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.4018535447685214,1.6219954307453837,3.400636547121535,3.6227786505458823,2.0226120445069267,5.6502857328064025,1.9469506069506084,2.0545557924622586,2.138507503627933,2.3409902041158843,2.2931108769894046,2.4000574358028657,2.4214486257841834,2.4732161909892554,2.5687161421197025,5.6865257437877545,2.7061321952397077,2.9504565686333644,2.973659465713028,3.0316467233633775,3.4933926673701317,3.4623020803001006,3.587125145032839,3.7099788181381825,3.506637894120152,8.17291277874619,12.875701090763709,4.383707912841026,4.6973654716960676,4.688631791727313,5.521540914662417,5.373120909544144,5.482320201509136,6.255510089742618,6.489124940924123,6.725513718988353,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.376671608533666E-5,7.32692898735228E-5,7.38388887364207E-5,7.341224685066963E-5,7.341344962768132E-5,7.331083229591223E-5,7.352886898295847E-5,7.32798401725087E-5,7.344459996688665E-5,8.148277448051813E-5,0.5176780758663477,7.316155035405012E-5,7.452707441080972E-5,7.559021950356327E-5,7.321489899335434E-5,7.301256460179121E-5,7.483377169455839E-5,7.353575808296299E-5,7.330761367997317E-5,7.336837265784209E-5,7.407825469472246E-5,7.360861341118235E-5,7.369242798445079E-5,7.377182331032665E-5,7.433798415418819E-5,7.394921742480595E-5,7.705790204247995E-5,7.318330061215478E-5,7.318525843683248E-5,7.33706728752184E-5,7.493014935092075E-5,7.353149731372325E-5,7.892983338659459E-5,7.373833056487437E-5,7.326295734373166E-5,7.360111418731171E-5,7.318954602964532E-5,7.323279566645088E-5,7.301219778076334E-5,7.30311405133439E-5,7.319552473494566E-5,7.396758242406146E-5,7.359172205424683E-5,7.330076095700275E-5,7.419144206317207E-5,7.33288941896082E-5,7.576524920644573E-5,0.476558622878768,7.304929274422384E-5,7.321073614845942E-5,7.318534390693616E-5,7.524505459127344E-5,7.321182538464326E-5,7.3024657016908E-5,7.382620713400408E-5,7.323068280734893E-5,7.875155109908811E-5,7.317033120930628E-5,7.304844797106031E-5,7.339723287040304E-5,7.412527173453575E-5,7.339237722595829E-5,7.303493384487677E-5,7.320498450250073E-5,7.301308087621984E-5,7.470245223411606E-5,7.364205429412436E-5,7.348518593633228E-5,7.342091982003292E-5,7.368855074369463E-5,7.301041724323445E-5,7.342245905522328E-5,7.461332259999573E-5,7.314125596636461E-5,7.49514639425204E-5,7.333463401636853E-5,7.3908587

{"value":"This is actually an insult to the victims and their families of the BTK killer. The events in this movie are not even close to the truth. Why they couldn't make a movie of the real events doesn't make any sense since the real events are more interesting then this made up farce. Don't even waste your time watching this for free. Low budget and a shameful depiction of the events which should not be made a joke of, which is really what this movie did. If they would allow me to give a -10 to this movie I would. The acting sucked and it looks like it was shot on an old VHS video camera from the 80s. Save your time and money by not watching this movie.","finished_norm":["thi","be","actual","a","insult","to","the","victim","and","their","famili","of","the","btk","killer","the","event","in","thi","movi","be","not","even","close","to","the","truth","why","thei","can","not","make","a","movi","of","the","real","event","doe","not","make","ani","sens","sinc","the","real","event","be","much","interest","then","thi","make","up","farc","do","not","even","wast","your","time","watch","thi","for","free","low","budget","and","a","shame","depict","of","the","event","which","should","not","be","make","a","joke","of","which","be","realli","what","thi","movi","do","if","thei","would","allow","me","to","give","a","to","thi","movi","i","would","the","act","suck","and","it","look","like","it","be","shoot","on","a","old","vh","video","camera","from","the","save","your","time","and","monei","by","not","watch","thi","movi"],"filtered":["thi","actual","insult","victim","famili","btk","killer","event","thi","movi","even","close","truth","thei","make","movi","real","event","doe","make","ani","sens","sinc","real","event","much","interest","thi","make","farc","even","wast","time","watch","thi","free","low","budget","shame","depict","event","make","joke","realli","thi","movi","thei","allow","give","thi","movi","act","suck","look","like","shoot","old","vh","video","camera","save","time","monei","watch","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["actual","insult","victim","famili","btk","killer","event","even","close","truth","make","real","event","doe","make","ani","sens","sinc","real","event","interest","make","farc","even","wast","time","watch","free","low","budget","shame","depict","event","make","joke","realli","allow","give","act","suck","look","like","shoot","old","vh","video","camera","save","time","monei","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,8,13,16,18,21,27,30,52,60,67,80,89,117,126,162,173,182,189,214,217,231,240,252,256,295,421,470,521,535,574,686,709,758,1011,2178,2639,4256],"values":[4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,8,13,16,18,21,27,30,52,60,67,80,89,117,126,162,173,182,189,214,217,231,240,252,256,295,421,470,521,535,574,686,709,758,1011,2178,2639,4256],"values":[2.479906862482093,0.6460382945576578,1.852034211452262,1.9218995441445863,1.8837873718108231,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.7122153074726136,1.838176641236591,1.9570915389266579,3.9903607800925114,1.9940046109572438,2.2797301185117202,2.2391270689902285,2.3586007221245198,2.4368824319140248,2.7365296724240786,2.498193474075453,2.7303758068497004,2.6113665294700725,2.7049353070058615,2.7666071276613566,3.0433232530252132,2.748952192422636,2.7910771187233068,3.2597778161886266,13.525899004664586,3.4076979462652486,3.4986697244709752,3.5039747767006686,3.6016814428070463,3.6497387377608255,3.8240921249056035,4.086456389373095,5.039114765418124,5.3064295350454715,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0163929718625856E-4,1.0095391964400366E-4,1.01738740104712E-4,1.0115089258052787E-4,1.0115254982401962E-4,1.0101115877350743E-4,1.0131158011267295E-4,1.0096845634877973E-4,1.0119547024601969E-4,1.1227085019489614E-4,0.9004870345473116,1.0080547099914708E-4,1.0268695512620805E-4,1.0415180710510713E-4,1.008789772970071E-4,1.0060019132893858E-4,1.0310953726112494E-4,1.0132107224299762E-4,1.010067240110655E-4,1.0109044062658095E-4,1.0206854993037863E-4,1.0142145578654488E-4,1.0153693950024465E-4,1.0164633416426303E-4,1.0242641755848513E-4,1.0189075622989758E-4,1.061740500578158E-4,1.0083543954139343E-4,1.008381371255454E-4,1.0109360997571172E-4,0.09157239879016424,1.0131520155206843E-4,1.0875328628105552E-4,1.016001862632955E-4,1.0094519438264544E-4,1.014111229984786E-4,1.0084404477527206E-4,1.0090363618616517E-4,1.0059968590544348E-4,1.0062578610521447E-4,1.0085228252038339E-4,1.0191606040115819E-4,1.0139818206990738E-4,1.0099728200275217E-4,1.0222450488120324E-4,1.0103604531148192E-4,1.0439297137175431E-4,1.0285784229892705E-4,1.0065079711406653E-4,1.008732415309073E-4,1.008382548903278E-4,1.0367622243819704E-4,1.0087474233243501E-4,1.006168528348179E-4,1.0172126678848994E-4,1.0090072498819444E-4,1.085076404482933E-4,1.0081756968001961E-4,1.0064963314533944E-4,1.0113020560294167E-4,1.0213333224869239E-4,1.011235152646029E-4,1.0063101273819279E-4,1.0086531663897869E-4,1.0060090267645228E-4,1.029285990497669E-4,1.0146753222887398E-4,1.0125139152907241E-4,1.0116284261107529E-4,1.015315972531393E-4,1.0059723259597475E-4,1.0116496344268138E-4,1.0280579199190656E-4,1.0077750842455185E-4,1.0327169924964685E-4,1.0104395391835573E-4,1.0183477456831129E-4,1.0121240522479756E-4,1.0056569240073427E-4,1.0069035048337525E-4]}}
{"value":"i went into watching this movie knowing it wasn't going to be great. but what i witnessed was to awful for words. i don't mean to be harsh, its just the movie was terrible. overall it had bad, i mean AWFUL special effects, the acting wasn't too bad, but wasn't good either, and sasquatch himself was like.... well, not sasquatch. in my opinion the best sasquatch movie is Harry and the Hendersons. its not violent or horror, but it has the best depiction of sasquatch. at least its a suit and not some half-ass cgi rip-off. only see this movie if you are desperate, or really appreciate anyone in the film. or go watch boondock saints, it is MUCH better.","finished_norm":["i","go","into","watch","thi","movi","know","it","be","not","go","to","be","great","but","what","i","wit","be","to","aw","for","word","i","do","not","mean","to","be","harsh","it","just","the","movi","be","terribl","overal","it","have","bad","i","mean","aw","special","effect","the","act","be","not","too","bad","but","be","not","good","either","and","sasquatch","himself","be","like","good","not","sasquatch","in","my","opinion","the","well","sasquatch","movi","be","harri","and","the","henderson","it","not","violent","or","horror","but","it","have","the","well","depict","of","sasquatch","at","littl","it","a","suit","and","not","some","halfass","cgi","ripoff","onli","see","thi","movi","if","you","be","desper","or","realli","appreci","anyon","in","the","film","or","go","watch","boondock","saint","it","be","much","well"],"filtered":["go","watch","thi","movi","know","go","great","wit","aw","word","mean","harsh","movi","terribl","overal","bad","mean","aw","special","effect","act","bad","good","either","sasquatch","like","good","sasquatch","opinion","well","sasquatch","movi","harri","henderson","violent","horror","well","depict","sasquatch","littl","suit","halfass","cgi","ripoff","onli","see","thi","movi","desper","realli","appreci","anyon","film","go","watch","boondock","saint","much","well"],"filtered2":["go","watch","know","go","great","wit","aw","word","mean","harsh","terribl","overal","bad","mean","aw","special","effect","act","bad","good","either","sasquatch","like","good","sasquatch","opinion","well","sasquatch","harri","henderson","violent","horror","well","depict","sasquatch","littl","suit","halfass","cgi","ripoff","onli","see","desper","realli","appreci","anyon","go","watch","boondock","saint","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,7,9,11,13,14,20,21,26,51,83,88,106,138,158,166,203,207,258,412,538,788,851,888,961,966,1010,1011,1012,1413,2296,3381,4406,7601],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,7,9,11,13,14,20,21,26,51,83,88,106,138,158,166,203,207,258,412,538,788,851,888,961,966,1010,1011,1012,1413,2296,3381,4406,7601],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,2.912480743411154,1.9218995441445863,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,3.4960351200691706,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.7139899308309823,2.292318797740072,4.063444682693467,2.159084361316692,4.581473037857885,2.3106972614914807,2.4423870329693536,2.569760528637609,2.5531798379045583,2.7061321952397077,3.107414446935464,3.43462735814388,3.753391311073496,3.857614816944247,3.9323057095458362,3.9954846111673676,4.026392148630444,4.34596758485818,4.086456389373095,4.297765483040301,4.484804029712395,5.064116067623542,5.7959777603641776,26.90205487595341,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.141757347682275E-5,9.08011234071845E-5,9.150701555834174E-5,9.097828704758875E-5,9.097977762439192E-5,9.08526060765065E-5,9.112281445660619E-5,9.081419817564282E-5,9.101838159884343E-5,1.0097992588623377E-4,1.1760552507581452E-4,9.066760403746827E-5,9.235986990502806E-5,9.36774037440143E-5,9.073371790849703E-5,9.048296906011109E-5,9.27399535384082E-5,9.113135197649692E-5,9.084861731199699E-5,9.092391466313954E-5,9.180365686545355E-5,9.122164008574345E-5,9.132550976189025E-5,9.142390275567048E-5,9.212553424057402E-5,9.164374363181856E-5,9.549627251657629E-5,9.069455868482064E-5,9.0696984976661E-5,9.092676527520649E-5,9.285939238494488E-5,9.112607169284446E-5,0.9927453563583656,9.138239588535268E-5,9.079327563330765E-5,9.121234645189889E-5,9.07022985022157E-5,9.075589688723726E-5,9.048251446635868E-5,9.050598980509455E-5,9.070970778868114E-5,9.166650299753169E-5,9.120070697463695E-5,9.084012487341618E-5,9.194392764231614E-5,9.087498980973615E-5,9.389431445351873E-5,9.251357119085708E-5,9.052848549133759E-5,9.072855898047029E-5,9.069709089800191E-5,9.32496479700637E-5,9.072990884846161E-5,9.049795494136101E-5,9.14912995093938E-5,9.075327846442478E-5,9.759517694519847E-5,9.067848597071904E-5,9.052743858133742E-5,9.095968053076059E-5,9.186192411550739E-5,9.095366303050625E-5,9.051069080281453E-5,9.072143108397516E-5,9.048360886838802E-5,9.257721203301118E-5,9.126308268391936E-5,9.106867895571144E-5,9.098903528007227E-5,9.132070477719629E-5,9.048030788283412E-5,9.099094282257355E-5,9.246675551130927E-5,9.064245362037145E-5,9.288580711976152E-5,9.088210305894193E-5,9.15933919686027E-5,9.103361345020027E-5,9.045193964145809E-5,9.056406103293552E-5]}}

{"value":"I did not think this movie was worth anything bad script, bad acting except for Janine Turner, no fantasy, stupid plot, dumb-ass husband and unfair divorce settings. If you have never seen this movie before don't even bother it's not worth it at all. The only thing that was good about it was that Janine Turner, did a good job acting. Terry's husband is a stuck up smart-ass defense attorney who has won a lot of cases and even gotten guility murderers off. He think he is so smart but he is really just a nut.

{"value":"I have seen every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Grey's Anatomy. Thus i have continued to watch. I'm afraid the second season lacks the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor Grey's Anatomy. The relationships seem contrived and the acting is so-so. The writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in GA. There are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, unfortunately PP is not so. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA. I'm afraid Kate Walsh's life in LA is simply not interesting.","finished_norm":["i","have","see","everi","episod","of","thi","spin","off","i","think","the","season","be","a","decent","effort","consid","the","expect","of","follow","such","a","success","that","be","grei","anatomi","thu","i","have","continu","to","watch","i","be","afraid","the","season","lack","the","charm","the","chemistri","and","much","importantli","the","drama","of","it","predecessor","grei","anatomi","the","relationship","seem","contriv","and","the","act","be","soso","the","write","lack","the","intellig","and","comed","hint","see","in","ga","there","be","show","that","a","formula","but","do","not","feel","formula","and","contriv","unfortun","pp","be","not","so","i","love","kate","walsh","presenc","in","ga","i","be","afraid","kate","walsh","life","in","la","be","simpli","not","interest"],"filtered":["see","everi","episod","thi","spin","think","season","decent","effort","consid","expect","follow","success","grei","anatomi","thu","continu","watch","afraid","season","lack","charm","chemistri","much","importantli","drama","predecessor","grei","anatomi","relationship","seem","contriv","act","soso","write","lack","intellig","comed","hint","see","ga","show","formula","feel","formula","contriv","unfortun","pp","love","kate","walsh","presenc","ga","afraid","kate","walsh","life","la","simpli","interest"],"filtered2":["see","everi","spin","think","season","decent","effort","consid","expect","follow","success","grei","anatomi","thu","continu","watch","afraid","season","lack","charm","chemistri","importantli","drama","predecessor","grei","anatomi","relationship","seem","contriv","act","soso","write","lack","intellig","comed","hint","see","ga","show","formula","feel","formula","contriv","unfortun","pp","love","kate","walsh","presenc","ga","afraid","kate","walsh","life","la","simpli","interest"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,12,21,28,35,43,54,60,65,75,85,130,183,201,227,260,309,317,401,433,463,532,577,603,766,797,817,1132,1159,1176,1181,1192,1244,1300,1593,1683,1808,1866,2894,2934,3252,3651,6729],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,12,21,28,35,43,54,60,65,75,85,130,183,201,227,260,309,317,401,433,463,532,577,603,766,797,817,1132,1159,1176,1181,1192,1244,1300,1593,1683,1808,1866,2894,2934,3252,3651,6729],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,1.162015545335049,1.5452294193519092,1.463169012899134,1.6608112036218214,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,1.9742250248702675,2.011190219103739,2.2642139034199635,4.977025712729459,2.561435818751577,2.6005321873043625,2.6754694156628323,2.848772527704847,2.8529247828056143,3.0879275592619675,3.164467636384302,3.3467891931782563,3.4446025032006995,3.604618302480356,3.530930586689197,3.9825254665248626,3.7987743169213135,8.394243914521228,4.218628162481577,4.224077767249142,8.716780209713471,8.526159850104824,4.268777946167049,8.679627438567602,4.370968887063596,10.0054942424945,4.706176101378222,4.770124825978496,10.05368934565262,5.339219357868463,11.39178860361439,5.5623629091826725,5.695894301807195,13.321950395701563]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.481452984855268E-5,6.437747032138375E-5,6.487794376605071E-5,6.450307831580259E-5,6.450413512611843E-5,6.441397123560131E-5,6.460554741128858E-5,0.19397038103893544,6.453150512030227E-5,7.159418229490955E-5,0.6154173097097075,6.428280586197293E-5,6.548261255573133E-5,6.641673641272805E-5,6.432968021341569E-5,6.415190073294938E-5,6.575208964928937E-5,6.461160046341789E-5,6.441114322467816E-5,6.446452861030516E-5,6.508826073381607E-5,6.467561420967219E-5,6.474925720815632E-5,6.481901727057881E-5,6.531646992756161E-5,6.4974883177834E-5,6.770630383249454E-5,6.430191655074899E-5,6.430363677760392E-5,6.446654967774191E-5,6.58367710993597E-5,6.460785677290649E-5,0.16228441285314002,6.47895891400475E-5,6.437190629518134E-5,6.466902507713113E-5,6.430740403643139E-5,6.434540498081978E-5,6.41515784286132E-5,6.416822230774205E-5,6.431265717760006E-5,6.499101943623864E-5,6.466077275520086E-5,6.440512213493634E-5,6.51877119017706E-5,6.442984117275188E-5,6.657052484881261E-5,6.559158587671595E-5,6.418417161893036E-5,6.432602256333969E-5,6.430371187522084E-5,6.611346004775606E-5,6.432697961192333E-5,6.41625256359154E-5,6.486680117841797E-5,6.434354853421897E-5,6.91944149096572E-5,0.023396454992628424,6.418342936580688E-5,6.448988640319245E-5,6.51295718764572E-5,6.448562003038233E-5,6.417155528788418E-5,6.432096892602937E-5,6.415235435331017E-5,6.563670686501728E-5,6.470499677162736E-5,6.456716565485858E-5,6.451069875034955E-5,6.474585050185223E-5,6.415001397368099E-5,6.451205118692912E-5,6.555839383120403E-5,6.426497436199292E-5,6.58554989932766E-5,6.443488442521892E-5,6.493918414039175E-5,6.454230441464874E-5,6.412990105493366E-5,6.420939447177017E-5]}}
{"value":"Look, I'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this, but life is confusing enough. I don't need to watch it that way. I dig Anthony Hopkins, big time. I even watched Fracture, and I knew that would be a steaming pile of Quentin. But this thing is not well shot, and it's not daring--even if it is artsy. Well-produced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits, not this \"oh, but it's a realistic interpretation\" excuse. This thing'll make your head hurt.

We've still got 3 more on the DVR to watch, maybe we'll get lucky. Oh yeah, I figured the guy out pretty quickly and nailed it when he picked up the flowers and then drove out with his cousin.

{"value":"I stopped watching lost at this episode because I thought Ana-Lucia and Libby's deaths were unnecessary and really depressing. Then I found out that they kept Libby around just to die in the next episode! Gah! I can't handle it.<br /><br />I liked this show for the first season, but it definitely declined in the second season, I found Jack and Locke's little religious feud to be annoying. The deaths of Rodriguez & Watros' characters was the final straw! <br /><br />I give this episode a 4/10, for being the end to my viewing of this formerly great series created by Alias legend J.J. Abrams. I hope his series in the future will improve on this one.","finished_norm":["i","stop","watch","lose","at","thi","episod","becaus","i","think","analucia","and","libbi","death","be","unnecessari","and","realli","depress","then","i","find","out","that","thei","keep","libbi","around","just","to","die","in","the","next","episod","gah","i","ca","not","handl","itbr","br","i","like","thi","show","for","the","season","but","it","definit","declin","in","the","season","i","find","jack","and","lock","littl","religi","feud","to","be","annoi","the","death","of","rodriguez","watro","charact","be","the","final","straw","br","br","i","give","thi","episod","a","for","be","the","end","to","my","view","of","thi","formerli","great","seri","creat","by","alia","legend","jj","abram","i","hope","hi","seri","in","the","futur","will","improv","on","thi","on"],"filtered":["stop","watch","lose","thi","episod","becaus","think","analucia","libbi","death","unnecessari","realli","depress","find","thei","keep","libbi","around","die","next","episod","gah","ca","handl","itbr","br","like","thi","show","season","definit","declin","season","find","jack","lock","littl","religi","feud","annoi","death","rodriguez","watro","charact","final","straw","br","br","give","thi","episod","end","view","thi","formerli","great","seri","creat","alia","legend","jj","abram","hope","hi","seri","futur","improv","thi"],"filtered2":["stop","watch","lose","becaus","think","analucia","libbi","death","unnecessari","realli","depress","find","keep","libbi","around","die","next","gah","ca","handl","itbr","like","show","season","definit","declin","season","find","jack","lock","littl","religi","feud","annoi","death","rodriguez","watro","charact","final","straw","give","end","view","formerli","great","creat","alia","legend","jj","abram","hope","futur","improv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,10,12,13,14,22,24,28,30,38,51,81,98,134,156,181,221,245,271,293,297,312,315,362,392,431,777,817,844,945,1075,1081,1116,1317,1318,1377,3330,5016,6637,7271,7796,7857],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,10,12,13,14,22,24,28,30,38,51,81,98,134,156,181,221,245,271,293,297,312,315,362,392,431,777,817,844,945,1075,1081,1116,1317,1318,1377,3330,5016,6637,7271,7796,7857],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,3.038623282696244,1.7139899308309823,1.949757232424728,2.0881990796736947,2.2443961816702407,2.3451551414151686,2.4442286541160034,2.6423424573643777,5.500405948648577,2.757740698455715,2.9012296278682137,2.813490713560207,2.8824835850471584,2.854312708080462,3.058539100262467,3.0670934723591254,3.1419947805322432,4.086456389373095,8.394243914521228,3.8690435127678695,3.9782428047328615,4.202455303235976,4.1302590120314875,4.181290492043933,4.597282013139085,4.436351646326448,4.558366596889411,5.626901430320244,6.1754673820690815,6.600350576034347,7.0356686472921925,6.948657270302562,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.484436704348602E-5,8.427224164151797E-5,0.0657911144224118,8.443666666792748E-5,8.443805006764576E-5,8.432002254759772E-5,8.457080210898277E-5,8.428437629366304E-5,8.447387829687055E-5,9.371915672305375E-5,0.6297157781606856,8.414832272767269E-5,8.571890944247769E-5,8.694170852120737E-5,8.420968280677884E-5,8.397696357655795E-5,8.607166388641294E-5,8.45787257547732E-5,8.431632058760007E-5,8.438620382618065E-5,0.05753790255318676,8.46625218695598E-5,8.475892299455706E-5,8.485024122759804E-5,8.550142323747182E-5,8.505427486443264E-5,8.862979500036019E-5,8.417333925246672E-5,8.417559108641537E-5,8.43888494704185E-5,8.618251471026877E-5,8.45738251398557E-5,9.078283689335343E-5,8.481171882970305E-5,8.426495814686855E-5,8.465389647674867E-5,8.418052255303948E-5,8.42302670483127E-5,8.397654166950313E-5,8.399832905873723E-5,8.41873990888793E-5,8.507539776131997E-5,8.464309391392134E-5,0.09508350101636218,8.533287471562753E-5,8.434079682113957E-5,0.08766106225312255,8.586155913021238E-5,8.401920723552435E-5,8.420489482164202E-5,8.417568939168408E-5,8.654470971113463E-5,8.420614762994746E-5,8.399087192657077E-5,8.491279194616302E-5,8.42278368982034E-5,9.057778170530557E-5,8.415842221624756E-5,8.401823560159296E-5,8.441939801723888E-5,8.525676749616403E-5,8.441381319387456E-5,8.400269204017346E-5,8.419827944296284E-5,8.397755738063982E-5,8.592062399887298E-5,8.47009846166788E-5,8.45205591181298E-5,8.4446642069234E-5,8.475446350313208E-5,8.397449374616246E-5,8.444841245352637E-5,8.581810964289963E-5,8.41249807033955E-5,8.62070301439092E-5,8.434739860571483E-5,8.500754364162E-5,0.0579220653117974,8.394816526912958E-5,8.40522247855895E-5]}}
{"value":"This movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. There were a couple of sub-plots that for awhile made you think these items would all come together in the end... but they didn't.

But, I just laughed it off again and said, \"there's no way I'm ever gonna see a part 3 to this one.\" Then, about 1/2 a year later, part 3 came out. I was stupid enough to rent it and boy, I just snapped after watching it. God, I never actually realized how much movies can suck these days. Just save yourself $7.50 and don't rent the whole series.

{"value":"Beautifully photographed and ably acted, generally, but the writing is very slipshod. There are scenes of such unbelievability that there is no joy in the watching. The fact that the young lover has a twin brother, for instance, is so contrived that I groaned out loud. And the \"emotion-light bulb connection\" seems gimmicky, too.<br /><br />I don't know, though. If you have a few glasses of wine and feel like relaxing with something pretty to look at with a few flaccid comedic scenes, this is a pretty good movie. No major effort on the part of the viewer required. But Italian film, especially Italian comedy, is usually much, much better than this.","finished_norm":["beautifulli","photograph","and","abli","act","gener","but","the","write","be","veri","slipshod","there","be","scene","of","such","unbeliev","that","there","be","no","joi","in","the","watch","the","fact","that","the","young","lover","have","a","twin","brother","for","instanc","be","so","contriv","that","i","groan","out","loud","and","the","emotionlight","bulb","connect","seem","gimmicki","toobr","br","i","do","not","know","though","if","you","have","a","few","glass","of","wine","and","feel","like","relax","with","someth","pretti","to","look","at","with","a","few","flaccid","comed","scene","thi","be","a","pretti","good","movi","no","major","effort","on","the","part","of","the","viewer","requir","but","italian","film","especi","italian","comedi","be","usual","much","much","well","than","thi"],"filtered":["beautifulli","photograph","abli","act","gener","write","veri","slipshod","scene","unbeliev","joi","watch","fact","young","lover","twin","brother","instanc","contriv","groan","loud","emotionlight","bulb","connect","seem","gimmicki","toobr","br","know","though","glass","wine","feel","like","relax","someth","pretti","look","flaccid","comed","scene","thi","pretti","good","movi","major","effort","part","viewer","requir","italian","film","especi","italian","comedi","usual","much","much","well","thi"],"filtered2":["beautifulli","photograph","abli","act","gener","write","veri","slipshod","scene","unbeliev","joi","watch","fact","young","lover","twin","brother","instanc","contriv","groan","loud","emotionlight","bulb","connect","seem","gimmicki","toobr","know","though","glass","wine","feel","like","relax","someth","pretti","look","flaccid","comed","scene","pretti","good","major","effort","part","viewer","requir","italian","especi","italian","comedi","usual","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,15,16,19,20,21,26,35,43,53,61,65,78,86,97,127,135,225,265,267,279,381,401,404,571,767,954,956,989,1030,1181,1216,1313,1683,1719,1776,2184,2718,2779,3334,3654,5428,8105,8582],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,15,16,19,20,21,26,35,43,53,61,65,78,86,97,127,135,225,265,267,279,381,401,404,571,767,954,956,989,1030,1181,1216,1313,1683,1719,1776,2184,2718,2779,3334,3654,5428,8105,8582],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.463169012899134,1.6608112036218214,1.7003182735607676,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,4.012839573363895,2.031112399272319,2.0545557924622586,2.4359679371086367,2.366244071437088,2.641219492619754,2.73529586597515,2.7085302779237206,2.7910771187233068,3.24941502915308,3.0879275592619675,3.1419947805322432,3.467417180966871,3.79165684915245,4.062925891962901,3.969732115064953,4.044492190274062,8.595530966080602,4.263079925052412,4.280272325592784,4.4919214974812585,4.706176101378222,4.9227044135737135,4.770124825978496,5.0768550934009715,5.274680836730892,5.339219357868463,5.583416318380505,5.672363804397,6.342521466732247,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.899096446482943E-5,7.845830992486309E-5,7.906824847067453E-5,7.861139128866871E-5,7.861267924780843E-5,7.850279443203501E-5,7.873627274193528E-5,7.846960740883032E-5,7.864603569185006E-5,0.1900557645968997,0.4495276698149219,7.834294016183502E-5,7.980517228992088E-5,8.094361060870822E-5,7.840006701653534E-5,7.818340305774548E-5,0.07707561249975907,7.874364973636489E-5,7.849934786980801E-5,7.856440987224568E-5,7.932456661671251E-5,7.882166476736873E-5,7.89114151904596E-5,7.899643338969294E-5,7.960269043178641E-5,7.918639077070057E-5,8.251523620666896E-5,7.836623079962156E-5,7.836832727981957E-5,7.856687299380887E-5,8.023679348658824E-5,7.87390872142754E-5,8.451974000093443E-5,7.896056864735048E-5,7.8451528917625E-5,7.881363443936016E-5,7.837291852516016E-5,0.051904688648043505,7.818301025800712E-5,7.820329453790388E-5,7.837932064962751E-5,7.920605640149686E-5,7.88035771440304E-5,7.849200982867823E-5,7.944577005199528E-5,7.852213549096807E-5,8.113103612761952E-5,7.993798059302243E-5,7.822273233180994E-5,7.839560935391163E-5,7.836841880301974E-5,8.057400069833007E-5,7.839677573112423E-5,7.819635187237997E-5,7.90546687417804E-5,7.841696865939718E-5,0.1844253575872123,7.835234288791962E-5,7.822182773078548E-5,7.859531400009398E-5,7.937491346035994E-5,7.859011447301533E-5,7.820735651778066E-5,7.838945036940415E-5,7.818395589535586E-5,7.999297058356709E-5,7.885747397423499E-5,7.868949600891965E-5,7.862067848825053E-5,7.890726335880645E-5,7.818110362064904E-5,7.862232673394556E-5,7.989752868056279E-5,7.832120850097801E-5,8.025961760343902E-5,0.041168167044920496,7.914288352927464E-5,7.86591970412876E-5,7.815659154204926E-5,7.82534

{"value":"and shot in Vancouver with the 'mountains' of the low country of South Carolina visible in the background. For heaven's sake, they should have reset the location. There are no coastal mountains in South Carolina. Period.<br /><br />Lame visuals. They should have been beautiful. And the story limped along.<br /><br />I really don't understand why it was such a hit as a book, although I have to admit it's one I haven't read as yet. Usually I read the book and give the film a miss.

{"value":"The film lacks style, i mean original style. everything looks copied including action, first appearances in the movie, songs, dialog delivery, etc etc. Yes, there the goof-ups were original, like in the beginning a car is shown with number UP**** number and few seconds later it starts falling down a hill with number MH**** . That was one in many goof-ups of the movie :) Anything good in the movie? yes, for kareena fans, if there are any, Kareena in bikini. For akshay fans, his dialogs and action stunts. Thats it. nothing else. So watch it on your own risk and don't blame the director or actors. Director is already insane and actors, i pity them.","finished_norm":["the","film","lack","styl","i","mean","origin","styl","everyth","look","copi","includ","action","appear","in","the","movi","song","dialog","deliveri","etc","etc","ye","there","the","goofup","be","origin","like","in","the","begin","a","car","be","show","with","numb","up","numb","and","few","second","late","it","start","fall","down","a","hill","with","numb","mh","that","be","on","in","mani","goofup","of","the","movi","anyth","good","in","the","movi","ye","for","kareena","fan","if","there","be","ani","kareena","in","bikini","for","akshai","fan","hi","dialog","and","action","stunt","that","it","noth","els","so","watch","it","on","your","own","risk","and","do","not","blame","the","director","or","actor","director","be","alreadi","insan","and","actor","i","piti","them"],"filtered":["film","lack","styl","mean","origin","styl","everyth","look","copi","includ","action","appear","movi","song","dialog","deliveri","etc","etc","ye","goofup","origin","like","begin","car","show","numb","numb","second","late","start","fall","hill","numb","mh","mani","goofup","movi","anyth","good","movi","ye","kareena","fan","ani","kareena","bikini","akshai","fan","hi","dialog","action","stunt","noth","els","watch","risk","blame","director","actor","director","alreadi","insan","actor","piti"],"filtered2":["lack","styl","mean","origin","styl","everyth","look","copi","includ","action","appear","song","dialog","deliveri","etc","etc","ye","goofup","origin","like","begin","car","show","numb","numb","second","late","start","fall","hill","numb","mh","mani","goofup","anyth","good","ye","kareena","fan","ani","kareena","bikini","akshai","fan","dialog","action","stunt","noth","els","watch","risk","blame","director","actor","director","alreadi","insan","actor","piti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,16,27,28,41,49,50,58,69,71,88,104,129,140,147,150,169,170,183,193,196,209,284,301,328,330,380,429,432,516,747,898,947,1018,1266,1285,1546,1928,2113,2758,3748,3816],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,16,27,28,41,49,50,58,69,71,88,104,129,140,147,150,169,170,183,193,196,209,284,301,328,330,380,429,432,516,747,898,947,1018,1266,1285,1546,1928,2113,2758,3748,3816],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.1966138720291084,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,3.1375198335242067,1.6920303308087352,1.717994385570355,3.731402629253362,4.254065042302116,1.9214926742550966,2.0317223413467334,2.0728240170322856,4.821391668015843,4.634339551994196,2.2844323215331563,2.332712011146513,2.4214486257841834,2.4071371113909277,2.4885128563647294,2.517840471459249,2.478925055209576,5.2053793708887675,3.110998680163279,2.8309760279012264,3.1550424959247185,2.9292757465539174,6.204124140393744,6.5744693248433315,6.47017040719651,10.326298118947744,3.7465885637507435,3.892300374932137,3.9911462095687695,4.268777946167049,4.327618446189983,4.449957298382227,4.6973654716960676,4.848596441419991,5.00274712124725,5.7959777603641776,5.822646007446338,12.596139408322827]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.512862510876638E-5,7.46220152260192E-5,7.520213023864265E-5,7.476761152896866E-5,7.476883651210462E-5,7.466432462032917E-5,7.488638678319004E-5,7.46327603086169E-5,7.480056196065869E-5,8.298714029355947E-5,0.6492187839912259,7.45122865787727E-5,7.590302145734059E-5,7.698579473705805E-5,7.456662016084124E-5,7.436055019518393E-5,7.621538110238667E-5,7.489340307236547E-5,7.46610465810848E-5,7.472292731419248E-5,7.54459154618353E-5,7.496760348322063E-5,7.505296547285363E-5,7.513382662527656E-5,7.571044014485537E-5,7.531449585701786E-5,7.848057418633426E-5,7.45344383983721E-5,7.45364323691498E-5,7.472526999905233E-5,7.631353811950715E-5,7.488906363919189E-5,8.038706583520533E-5,0.15801430808819605,7.461556578266702E-5,7.495996580584141E-5,7.454079912112343E-5,7.458484724908803E-5,7.436017660176744E-5,7.437946906224427E-5,7.454688820754319E-5,7.533319991783838E-5,7.49504002716622E-5,7.465406734055005E-5,7.556119253830788E-5,7.468271997954061E-5,7.716405590454097E-5,7.602933597043267E-5,7.439795642647896E-5,0.18697083517728325,7.453651941723486E-5,7.66342572595577E-5,7.456348980600315E-5,7.437286586504401E-5,7.518921450368389E-5,7.458269538158189E-5,8.020549203265035E-5,7.4521229549501E-5,7.439709605679364E-5,7.475232035491755E-5,7.549380054802744E-5,7.474737506372783E-5,7.438333242769917E-5,7.455652262490614E-5,7.436107600126641E-5,7.608163717237841E-5,7.500166176439652E-5,7.484189724362872E-5,7.477644462197391E-5,7.50490166490116E-5,7.435836319128101E-5,7.477801227510675E-5,7.599086199322903E-5,7.449161750842295E-5,7.63352462291617E-5,7.468856577715436E-5,7.527311594410314E-5,7.481307977322774E-5,7.43350496543944E-5,7.44271930538155E-5]}}

{"value":"This ranks as one of the worst movies I've seen in years. Besides Cuba and Angie, the acting is actually embarrassing. Wasn't Archer once a decent actress? What happened to her? The action is decent but completely implausible. The make up is so bad it's worth mentioning. I mean, who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film. Someone should tell the make up artist, and the DOP that you're not supposed to actually see it.

{"value":"This film is so bad, it made me want to vomit. Poorly produced, a complete laugh free zone. Why in the name of god would you spoof a movie which to a degree is a spoof (and a damn funny one at that) as it stands? The sets are laughable, the effects so bad that they aren't even laughable, and the acting farcical. It is a complete mystery why you would even consider watching this lump of garbage. National Lampoon once made Animal House, which people still consider to be completely and utterly hilarious. Now they've been relegated to making TV movies like this lump of ****. Name your expletive, and it could be accurately used to describe this film.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","so","bad","it","make","me","want","to","vomit","poorli","produc","a","complet","laugh","free","zone","why","in","the","name","of","god","would","you","spoof","a","movi","which","to","a","degre","be","a","spoof","and","a","damn","funni","on","at","that","a","it","stand","the","set","be","laughabl","the","effect","so","bad","that","thei","be","not","even","laughabl","and","the","act","farcic","it","be","a","complet","mysteri","why","you","would","even","consid","watch","thi","lump","of","garbag","nation","lampoon","onc","make","anim","hous","which","peopl","still","consid","to","be","complet","and","utterli","hilari","now","thei","have","be","releg","to","make","tv","movi","like","thi","lump","of","name","your","explet","and","it","can","be","accur","us","to","describ","thi","film"],"filtered":["thi","film","bad","make","want","vomit","poorli","produc","complet","laugh","free","zone","name","god","spoof","movi","degre","spoof","damn","funni","stand","set","laughabl","effect","bad","thei","even","laughabl","act","farcic","complet","mysteri","even","consid","watch","thi","lump","garbag","nation","lampoon","onc","make","anim","hous","peopl","still","consid","complet","utterli","hilari","thei","releg","make","tv","movi","like","thi","lump","name","explet","accur","us","describ","thi","film"],"filtered2":["bad","make","want","vomit","poorli","produc","complet","laugh","free","zone","name","god","spoof","degre","spoof","damn","funni","stand","set","laughabl","effect","bad","even","laughabl","act","farcic","complet","mysteri","even","consid","watch","lump","garbag","nation","lampoon","onc","make","anim","hous","peopl","still","consid","complet","utterli","hilari","releg","make","tv","like","lump","name","explet","accur","us","describ"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,9,21,23,37,56,62,64,103,106,109,133,143,172,213,236,261,277,317,352,377,398,403,552,632,668,686,702,816,889,1055,1548,1602,1630,2680,2881,2937,6830,7529,8335],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,9,21,23,37,56,62,64,103,106,109,133,143,172,213,236,261,277,317,352,377,398,403,552,632,668,686,702,816,889,1055,1548,1602,1630,2680,2881,2937,6830,7529,8335],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,1.852034211452262,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.4876543214774305,1.8610609350701788,2.0226120445069267,1.883428577602134,6.295746123656246,2.159084361316692,2.125691139326857,2.3212364753796515,4.681980408231769,2.5001408943598484,2.8432628718938773,2.617923930016232,2.7085302779237206,3.1163992333432793,5.705849565611229,3.1236456418640466,3.0602441305135506,3.143848349181566,3.189397019426827,6.849501469295936,3.541919708264792,3.5813614403160887,3.6016814428070463,3.6466665387238555,3.7881170224473255,3.9571003681590526,4.246178114249808,9.448067437556459,4.613282354485526,4.654440426979034,5.373120909544144,5.719991853386255,5.444579873526289,13.589013180950609,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.06233842030112156,7.502866294115414E-5,7.561193925200418E-5,7.517505266148514E-5,7.517628432008534E-5,7.507120289769795E-5,7.529447517356464E-5,7.503946657836569E-5,7.520818265436391E-5,0.3510491687303088,0.4813384140233031,7.49183363349333E-5,7.631664993084104E-5,7.740532371162206E-5,7.497296600424815E-5,7.47657730740014E-5,7.663071175902401E-5,7.530152969754187E-5,7.506790699499647E-5,7.513012494304873E-5,7.585705296657695E-5,7.537613445860716E-5,7.54619616227324E-5,7.554326342263417E-5,7.612301915928583E-5,0.09953056354289451,7.890824886221493E-5,7.494060886940216E-5,7.494261370619115E-5,7.513248039421411E-5,7.672940367628911E-5,7.529716661691546E-5,8.082512981068598E-5,7.550896643526266E-5,7.502217835198882E-5,7.53684551602124E-5,7.49470042544896E-5,7.499129241980159E-5,7.476539744471242E-5,7.478479503817109E-5,7.495312652298133E-5,7.574372318671026E-5,7.535883749929007E-5,7.506088972155403E-5,7.597295823782037E-5,7.508969850119749E-5,7.758455630149602E-5,7.644365278648165E-5,7.480338314806912E-5,7.496870319936719E-5,7.494270122863896E-5,7.705187055398929E-5,7.496981859074932E-5,7.47781558572863E-5,7.55989531336057E-5,7.498912882583643E-5,8.06425665337552E-5,7.492732803978653E-5,7.480251808985636E-5,7.515967815919677E-5,7.590519899936549E-5,7.515470591897122E-5,7.47886794567794E-5,7.496281344246172E-5,7.476630174542919E-5,7.649623900035323E-5,7.541037833812396E-5,7.524974319121275E-5,7.518393388984399E-5,7.545799128003715E-5,7.476357415216599E-5,7.518551008579843E-5,7.64049691478949E-5,7.489755462985764E-5,7.675123008284524E-5,7.509557615509703E-5,7.568331178935127E-5,7.522076868192104E-5,7.474013356970874E-5,7.483277909846427E-5]}}
{"value":"Watched this on DVD in original language with English subs. Either the subtitling was very poor or the actual dialog doesn't make much of story and give any character development. There are quite a few HK stars in this but the movie doesn't need their presence to make it better or worse. It's just bad. The bright and colorful scenes done in CG are attractive for the sheer colors and brilliance but it can get overwhelming before long. If anything this makes me think of a child's movie with its nonstop barrage of cg, fight scenes, and crap plot. I'm certain I grasped what took place in the film but the whole delivery of the story was rather lousy.","finished_norm":["watch","thi","on","dvd","in","origin","languag","with","english","sub","either","the","subtitl","be","veri","poor","or","the","actual","dialog","doe","not","make","much","of","stori","and","give","ani","charact","develop","there","be","quit","a","few","hk","star","in","thi","but","the","movi","doe","not","ne","their","presenc","to","make","it","well","or","wrong","it","just","bad","the","bright","and","color","scene","do","in","cg","be","attract","for","the","sheer","color","and","brillianc","but","it","can","get","overwhelm","befor","long","if","anyth","thi","make","me","think","of","a","child","movi","with","it","nonstop","barrag","of","cg","fight","scene","and","crap","plot","i","be","certain","i","grasp","what","take","place","in","the","film","but","the","whole","deliveri","of","the","stori","be","rather","lousi"],"filtered":["watch","thi","dvd","origin","languag","english","sub","either","subtitl","veri","poor","actual","dialog","doe","make","much","stori","give","ani","charact","develop","quit","hk","star","thi","movi","doe","ne","presenc","make","well","wrong","bad","bright","color","scene","cg","attract","sheer","color","brillianc","get","overwhelm","befor","long","anyth","thi","make","think","child","movi","nonstop","barrag","cg","fight","scene","crap","plot","certain","grasp","take","place","film","whole","deliveri","stori","rather","lousi"],"filtered2":["watch","dvd","origin","languag","english","sub","either","subtitl","veri","poor","actual","dialog","doe","make","stori","give","ani","charact","develop","quit","hk","star","doe","ne","presenc","make","well","wrong","bad","bright","color","scene","cg","attract","sheer","color","brillianc","get","overwhelm","befor","long","anyth","make","think","child","nonstop","barrag","cg","fight","scene","crap","plot","certain","grasp","take","place","whole","deliveri","stori","rather","lousi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,9,10,12,15,17,18,19,20,25,27,30,31,32,52,69,79,99,100,104,110,111,120,146,160,164,180,207,232,247,313,320,432,588,648,774,875,1094,1117,1159,1329,1626,2113,2254,2892,2924,2954,3037,3586,3932,5214,7123],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,9,10,12,15,17,18,19,20,25,27,30,31,32,52,69,79,99,100,104,110,111,120,146,160,164,180,207,232,247,313,320,432,588,648,774,875,1094,1117,1159,1329,1626,2113,2254,2892,2924,2954,3037,3586,3932,5214,7123],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,2.430631986809635,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.7122153074726136,2.127032521151058,1.9469506069506084,2.056430207256609,2.1405462403177813,2.0728240170322856,2.1290479736304078,2.1183455303375887,2.2044500422972613,2.326138445979858,2.3722295531801256,2.3930275298746078,2.7097314792693545,2.5531798379045583,2.8377834061292515,2.7303758068497004,2.907069060519773,2.938298364153555,3.235085203598255,3.6375061693251913,3.6105180246075443,3.753391311073496,7.856464768316401,4.218628162481577,4.224077767249142,4.224077767249142,4.416284083275639,4.613282354485526,5.00274712124725,5.143104478942172,11.39178860361439,5.373120909544144,5.373120909544144,5.408212229355414,5.672363804397,5.7959777603641776,6.948657270302562,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.126240356293642E-5,7.078186451592158E-5,0.05240279593714691,7.09199682344847E-5,7.092113017831726E-5,7.08219966110778E-5,7.103263115207917E-5,7.079205664190931E-5,7.095122299200581E-5,7.871650883524713E-5,0.6252726802915004,7.06777826545648E-5,7.199694841890664E-5,7.302400070842586E-5,7.072932015637298E-5,7.053385483228896E-5,0.1058181347569289,7.103928637344134E-5,7.081888726420515E-5,7.087758353036343E-5,7.156336572155824E-5,7.110966832992252E-5,7.119063747510992E-5,7.126733740231057E-5,7.181427760349995E-5,7.143870914890003E-5,7.444185676791969E-5,7.069879451130598E-5,7.070068586962708E-5,7.087980565746428E-5,7.23863393335716E-5,7.103517025341914E-5,0.08662580382334699,7.12349817049241E-5,7.077574696972326E-5,7.11024236978413E-5,7.070482790258661E-5,7.074660925379142E-5,7.053350046449939E-5,7.055180010863944E-5,7.071060363631188E-5,7.145645067323284E-5,7.109335041910117E-5,7.081226718491009E-5,7.16727104824034E-5,7.083944532000749E-5,7.3193088313029E-5,7.211676261482452E-5,7.056933608788835E-5,7.072529863625368E-5,7.070076843809892E-5,7.269055382911909E-5,7.07263508938656E-5,7.05455367209758E-5,7.131987494492955E-5,0.12453144614388222,7.60780079885647E-5,7.068626540781857E-5,7.056851999400084E-5,7.090546396511196E-5,7.160878657588546E-5,7.090077316535372E-5,7.055546466003724E-5,7.071974225341

{"value":"Iberia is nice to see on TV. But why see this in silver screen? Lot of dance and music. If you like classical music or modern dance this could be your date movie. But otherwise one and half hour is just too long time. If you like to see skillful dancing in silver screen it's better to see Bollywood movie. They know how to combine breath taking dancing to long movie. Director Carlos Saura knows how to shoot dancing from old experience. And time to time it's look really good. but when the movie is one and hour it should be at least most of time interesting.

{"value":"Needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried - left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dry.<br /><br />I don't recall ever walking out on a movie before, but I really tried to stay. The script was not up to the cast and just kept \"going and going\" badly - come on! Uma Thurman doing this stuff? Fairly lame special effects. These were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20-something lives - just sort of annoying and wrong feeling.<br /><br />This review is base only on the first hour - it might have gotten better. I just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went

{"value":"Take young, pretty people, put them in an exotic locale, stick in a few bad guys, have the two lead characters find romance after a couple of heavy breathing scenes, create the flimsiest of plots, then work out a happy ending for everybody (other than the three or four who get murdered, of course) That's the classic (and successful) format of the Harlequin Romance. It's not very good but then it's not very bad either, like most of the little yellow pocket books.

{"value":"I was lured to see this movie by its starpower, but ultimately that's all it delivers. It plays much more like a Greek tragedy than a modern thriller about big city corruption. It's greatest flaw is its predictibability and utter lack of suspense. We know who the bad guys are from the beginning, and just follow along as they fall like dominoes. The film to its credit does abstain from gratuitous violence and sex, but has forgotten to substitute good, clean romance or excitement in any other way. All the flavor of a good, flat decaffeinated diet cola. \"Q&A\", which also takes place in New York, is a far better alternative, as is \"LA

{"value":"Brilliant book with wonderful characterizations and insights into human nature, particularly the nature of addiction, which still resonate strongly today.<br /><br />As for the movie... eh. Nothing special. The cameraman clearly had an unfortunate addiction to circling and circling and CIRCLING around everything, making the viewer quite nauseous. Why the director didn't put a stop to this is beyond me--but maybe he was too busy trying, and somehow failing, to draw good performances from these normally excellent but inappropriately-cast actors.

{"value":"What is this ? A low budget sex comedy ? Anyway it describes perfectly the people in Spain. They could come up with a better idea, I mean they do this kind of movies since the 60s.. and people like them !
