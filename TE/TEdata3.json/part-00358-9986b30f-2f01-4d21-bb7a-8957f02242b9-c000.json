{"value":"As far as HEIST movies go, this one is pretty weak. Continuity is pretty lousy, there isn't enough character continuity to really feel like you understand any of the characters. Peter Falk is great, and he is one of the reasons its worth watching. Falk has some great lines, like \"he'll be right back, he goin' buy to some saugages\" or something like that... there are a few nice scenes, although they are entirely due to the efforts of the actors. Direction, script, and editing is pretty lousy.","finished_norm":["a","far","a","heist","movi","go","thi","on","be","pretti","weak","continu","be","pretti","lousi","there","be","not","enough","charact","continu","to","realli","feel","like","you","understand","ani","of","the","charact","peter","falk","be","great","and","he","be","on","of","the","reason","it","worth","watch","falk","have","some","great","line","like","he","will","be","right","back","he","goin","bui","to","some","saugag","or","someth","like","that","there","be","a","few","nice","scene","although","thei","be","entir","due","to","the","effort","of","the","actor","direct","script","and","edit","be","pretti","lousi"],"filtered":["far","heist","movi","go","thi","pretti","weak","continu","pretti","lousi","enough","charact","continu","realli","feel","like","understand","ani","charact","peter","falk","great","reason","worth","watch","falk","great","line","like","right","back","goin","bui","saugag","someth","like","nice","scene","although","thei","entir","due","effort","actor","direct","script","edit","pretti","lousi"],"filtered2":["far","heist","go","pretti","weak","continu","pretti","lousi","enough","charact","continu","realli","feel","like","understand","ani","charact","peter","falk","great","reason","worth","watch","falk","great","line","like","right","back","goin","bui","saugag","someth","like","nice","scene","although","entir","due","effort","actor","direct","script","edit","pretti","lousi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,7,10,13,19,27,41,43,51,53,63,77,78,93,95,101,102,107,121,198,212,219,237,262,347,348,379,401,433,568,760,1117,3639,3837],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,7,10,13,19,27,41,43,51,53,63,77,78,93,95,101,102,107,121,198,212,219,237,262,347,348,379,401,433,568,760,1117,3639,3837],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,1.3002700588679295,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,3.4279798616619646,1.7003182735607676,1.8729627573220065,1.9463902258768238,6.019259360045842,2.035389827120098,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.087553710177271,2.1439533986393955,2.2190595059394194,2.5439726117360975,2.5983793339432615,2.5792094178355414,2.640097787510554,2.726701583487816,3.0151989841543516,3.0103169565570433,3.1272886331425473,3.0879275592619675,6.328935272768604,3.4471119148061256,3.850067611308864,8.448155534498284,12.350934764138163,5.9370563586240825]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1512315451505593E-4,1.1434685217056443E-4,1.1523578991084742E-4,1.1456995628909455E-4,1.1457183338883698E-4,1.1441168486158644E-4,1.1475196124292537E-4,1.1436331737011229E-4,1.146204477979342E-4,1.2716512994809609E-4,0.8262700727758049,1.1417870976155057E-4,1.1630979875836182E-4,1.1796898359510312E-4,1.1426196768560784E-4,1.1394619690632188E-4,1.167884422531529E-4,1.147627126355097E-4,1.1440666176662245E-4,1.1450148454806888E-4,1.1560935356754237E-4,1.1487641344331224E-4,1.1500721766750779E-4,1.1513112504543694E-4,1.1601469728190259E-4,1.1540797307575508E-4,1.2025950502093545E-4,1.1421265404506223E-4,1.1421570950102998E-4,1.1450507435515921E-4,1.1693885290465009E-4,1.1475606311630146E-4,1.2318091257174446E-4,1.1507885498768658E-4,1.1433696938271235E-4,1.148647098681198E-4,1.142224008821309E-4,1.142898979171748E-4,1.139456244314157E-4,1.1397518718336589E-4,1.1423173147796893E-4,1.1543663419501265E-4,1.1485005214654246E-4,1.1439596714542691E-4,1.1578599809774084E-4,1.1443987294273118E-4,1.1824214163437858E-4,1.1650335647603788E-4,1.140035162481702E-4,1.1425547099087215E-4,1.1421584288893815E-4,1.174303060500061E-4,1.1425717089446214E-4,1.1396506879120205E-4,1.1521599851776413E-4,1.1428660050856328E-4,1.2290267842467788E-4,1.1419241349963294E-4,1.1400219786290653E-4,1.1454652489805747E-4,1.1568273015560961E-4,0.16473353475700514,1.139811072014358E-4,1.1424649475251484E-4,1.1394700262391341E-4,1.1658350008766668E-4,1.1492860256244827E-4,1.1468378781196206E-4,1.1458349165633198E-4,1.1500116669749921E-4,1.1394284565654357E-4,1.1458589384555848E-4,1.1644440097650609E-4,1.1414703756501947E-4,1.1697211727037449E-4,1.1444883073559613E-4,1.1534456467314681E-4,1.1463962943567203E-4,1.1390712121854935E-4,1.1404831691850712E-4]}}

{"value":"Slaughter High the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history. Unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell. A very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness. The guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released.

{"value":"After seeing the trailer for this movie and finding out Spike Lee was directing, I was excited to hear about this event. I wasn't alive at the time, I didn't live in New York, so I expected more of a history lesson than anything. What I got was some interesting acting, a lot of sex, and about 30 minutes worth of film that actually had anything to do with the Son of Sam. I guess the film wasn't about the Son of Sam, but it was a peek into the summer of '77. Label me disappointed.<br /><br />","finished_norm":["after","see","the","trailer","for","thi","movi","and","find","out","spike","lee","be","direct","i","be","excit","to","hear","about","thi","event","i","be","not","aliv","at","the","time","i","do","not","live","in","new","york","so","i","expect","much","of","a","histori","lesson","than","anyth","what","i","get","be","some","interest","act","a","lot","of","sex","and","about","minut","worth","of","film","that","actual","have","anyth","to","do","with","the","son","of","sam","i","guess","the","film","be","not","about","the","son","of","sam","but","it","be","a","peek","into","the","summer","of","label","me","disappointedbr","br"],"filtered":["see","trailer","thi","movi","find","spike","lee","direct","excit","hear","thi","event","aliv","time","live","new","york","expect","much","histori","lesson","anyth","get","interest","act","lot","sex","minut","worth","film","actual","anyth","son","sam","guess","film","son","sam","peek","summer","label","disappointedbr","br"],"filtered2":["see","trailer","find","spike","lee","direct","excit","hear","event","aliv","time","live","new","york","expect","histori","lesson","anyth","get","interest","act","lot","sex","minut","worth","actual","anyth","son","sam","guess","son","sam","peek","summer","label","disappointedbr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,21,38,52,59,60,72,87,102,104,116,130,216,219,243,254,434,470,499,524,570,827,950,1048,1058,1272,1384,2591,2598,3580,6318],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,21,38,52,59,60,72,87,102,104,116,130,216,219,243,254,434,470,499,524,570,827,950,1048,1058,1272,1384,2591,2598,3580,6318],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.162015545335049,1.519311641348122,1.7122153074726136,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,1.9209463754160525,2.115024371522662,2.087553710177271,4.145648034064571,2.2466628996789315,2.2642139034199635,2.6070186965339692,2.5792094178355414,2.627841366673578,2.889652074525771,6.820232654259061,3.3814747511661465,3.3814747511661465,3.4028786598293,3.944626193933877,4.062925891962901,4.125296222689358,4.160564361526816,9.178753667263944,4.416284083275639,4.573751515728891,5.501738287366237,5.259176650194926,5.649374286172302,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1102799367316019E-4,1.1027930595559606E-4,1.1113662240266287E-4,1.1049447381444219E-4,1.1049628414199275E-4,1.1034183241813894E-4,1.1067000448807196E-4,1.1029518545506709E-4,1.1054316923933402E-4,1.2264161195719598E-4,0.6988087312186687,1.1011714470834027E-4,1.1217242660755158E-4,1.1377259092143184E-4,1.1019744098153058E-4,1.0989290280037654E-4,1.1263404379598965E-4,1.1068037343212026E-4,1.1033698800470856E-4,1.1042843775018204E-4,1.1149689765299599E-4,1.1079002967479802E-4,1.1091618093114244E-4,1.1103568067583522E-4,1.11887822480786E-4,1.1130268066804416E-4,1.1598163391931366E-4,1.1014988152580196E-4,1.101528282930903E-4,1.1043189986065486E-4,1.1277910403980552E-4,1.106739604496087E-4,1.1879912116099207E-4,1.1098526996857439E-4,1.1026977471827254E-4,1.1077874241918127E-4,1.101592816483833E-4,1.102243776789028E-4,1.0989235068954767E-4,1.0992086183528818E-4,1.1016828033626705E-4,1.1133032225397012E-4,0.2350713681559821,1.1032667381257721E-4,1.1166725858398238E-4,1.1036901779286378E-4,1.1403603218295914E-4,1.1235909909011215E-4,1.0994818317860187E-4,1.1019117538721944E-4,1.1015295693612382E-4,1.1325307521391982E-4,1.1019281482183908E-4,1.0991110337456948E-4,1.1111753502901254E-4,1.102211975657101E-4,0.05756235865305961,1.1013036097705282E-4,1.0994691169093868E-4,1.1047187592484494E-4,1.115676640890792E-4,1.1046456758187808E-4,1.0992657126647587E-4,1.1018251845161216E-4,1.0989367985698199E-4,1.124363918331954E-4,1.1084036232259292E-4,1.1060425612238864E-4,1.1050752770159748E-4,1.1091034520623847E-4,1.0988967076125504E-4,1.1050984444014904E-4,1.1230224075560432E-4,1.100865991551813E-4,1.1281118512551542E-4,1.1037765693912174E-4,1.1124152782912768E-4,1.1056166854785598E-4,1.098552171129659E-4,1.0999139019949766E-4]}}
{"value":"The plot is about the death of little children. Hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings. During the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter. In the end the serial killer get caught. That's it. But before you find out who dunnit, you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors. It is unbelievable how bad these actors are, including Hopper. I could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time. Just don't watch the movie.

{"value":"Bizarre take on the Cinderella tale. Terribly poor script, but Kathleen Turner turns in a pretty decent evil step-mother performance.<br /><br />Visually stunning in some parts, but that's about it. The period costumes range from the Elizabethan era to the 1990s. Fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivel.<br /><br />If you're really in the mood for a Cinderella story - I suggest \"Ever After: A Cinderella Story\" or \"The Glass Slipper\".","finished_norm":["bizarr","take","on","the","cinderella","tale","terribli","poor","script","but","kathleen","turner","turn","in","a","pretti","decent","evil","stepmoth","performancebr","br","visual","stun","in","some","part","but","that","about","it","the","period","costum","rang","from","the","elizabethan","era","to","the","fast","forward","until","you","see","someth","interest","and","save","yourself","the","full","minut","of","drivelbr","br","if","you","re","realli","in","the","mood","for","a","cinderella","stori","i","suggest","ever","after","a","cinderella","stori","or","the","glass","slipper"],"filtered":["bizarr","take","cinderella","tale","terribli","poor","script","kathleen","turner","turn","pretti","decent","evil","stepmoth","performancebr","br","visual","stun","part","period","costum","rang","elizabethan","era","fast","forward","see","someth","interest","save","full","minut","drivelbr","br","re","realli","mood","cinderella","stori","suggest","ever","cinderella","stori","glass","slipper"],"filtered2":["bizarr","take","cinderella","tale","terribli","poor","script","kathleen","turner","turn","pretti","decent","evil","stepmoth","performancebr","visual","stun","part","period","costum","rang","elizabethan","era","fast","forward","see","someth","interest","save","full","minut","drivelbr","re","realli","mood","cinderella","stori","suggest","ever","cinderella","stori","glass","slipper"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,13,17,31,44,53,59,60,61,68,77,78,96,146,189,309,321,336,542,635,646,699,743,776,820,825,1129,1153,1204,1553,1555,1776,3144,3308,6422,6806,7953,8380],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,13,17,31,44,53,59,60,61,68,77,78,96,146,189,309,321,336,542,635,646,699,743,776,820,825,1129,1153,1204,1553,1555,1776,3144,3308,6422,6806,7953,8380],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.1317941569733974,2.5541073880211935,1.4070669811451506,1.604729392502474,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.0064197866819473,1.9463902258768238,2.0064197866819473,2.0390708128715254,2.326138445979858,2.498193474075453,2.848772527704847,3.09496984188738,2.9233055795674137,3.4471119148061256,3.587125145032839,3.5900195030592035,3.5813614403160887,3.7568101178222815,3.770603439954617,3.900174431363043,3.850067611308864,4.197121957260614,4.213208095012239,4.3215761317340196,4.589376833631972,4.589376833631972,4.770124825978496,19.313494939609715,5.822646007446338,6.660975197850782,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.479139958940651E-5,8.421963135936411E-5,8.487435868562566E-5,0.05545764595510019,8.438533627301955E-5,8.426738243632218E-5,8.451800543864073E-5,8.423175843597231E-5,8.442114213505424E-5,9.36606488302722E-5,0.4182510101535543,8.409578980680523E-5,8.566539602069315E-5,8.688743171870225E-5,8.415711157945351E-5,8.392453763342258E-5,8.601793024370554E-5,8.452592413778166E-5,8.426368278741956E-5,8.433352239862264E-5,8.514949869043468E-5,8.460966793952714E-5,0.05707064830929062,8.479727010632661E-5,8.544804559005839E-5,8.50011763670882E-5,0.4154428357836636,8.412079071404355E-5,8.412304114219574E-5,8.433616639121237E-5,8.612871186454736E-5,8.452102658226697E-5,9.072616211443863E-5,8.475877175756313E-5,8.421235241172449E-5,8.460104793145886E-5,8.412796953015663E-5,8.41776829704599E-5,8.392411598975993E-5,8.394588977735402E-5,8.41348417730468E-5,8.502228607717116E-5,8.459025211255891E-5,8.425580590198267E-5,8.527960229129963E-5,8.428814374070157E-5,8.70886201986117E-5,8.580795665371452E-5,8.396675492011297E-5,8.415232658340588E-5,8.41231393860935E-5,8.649068075084905E-5,8.415357860959618E-5,8.393843730059745E-5,8.48597817751299E-5,8.417525433746798E-5,0.047415591517072316,8.410588299037465E-5,8.396578389276251E-5,8.436669586689335E-5,8.520354258478003E-5,8.436111453007604E-5,8.39502500350264E-5,8.414571533463868E-5,8.392513106679877E-5,8.58669846487932E-5,8.464810667475398E-5,8.44677938139633E-5,8.439392291071075E-5,8.470155217489583E-5,8.392206934491647E-5,8.439569218977065E-5,8.576453429146386E-5,8.407246235471052E-5,8.615321199345807E-5,8.429474140385151E-5,8.495447431809093E-5,8.443526994380878E-5,8.38957573044774E-5,8.399975185766573E-5]}}
{"value":"waste of my life, .... the director should be embarrassed. why people feel they need to make worthless movies will never make sense to me. when she died at the end, it made me laugh. i had to change the channel many times throughout the film because i was getting embarrassed watching such poor acting. hopefully the guy who played Heath never gets work again.

{"value":"After Disney's witty live-action George of the Jungle, I had high hopes for this flick. Major disappointment. Thread bare plot, bad acting, bad visual effects. This film relied on lame one-liners, idiotic ( and pointless) product placement, and the lamest most annoying side-kick in that gadget car thing. I took two young kids to see it and they where bored out of their mind. The only laugh received from this movie was bad standby of when needing a laugh show a guy getting it in the groin!","finished_norm":["after","disnei","witti","liveact","georg","of","the","jungl","i","have","high","hope","for","thi","flick","major","disappoint","thread","bare","plot","bad","act","bad","visual","effect","thi","film","reli","on","lame","onelin","idiot","and","pointless","product","placem","and","the","lame","much","annoi","sidekick","in","that","gadget","car","thing","i","take","two","young","kid","to","see","it","and","thei","where","bore","out","of","their","mind","the","onli","laugh","receiv","from","thi","movi","be","bad","standbi","of","when","ne","a","laugh","show","a","gui","get","it","in","the","groin"],"filtered":["disnei","witti","liveact","georg","jungl","high","hope","thi","flick","major","disappoint","thread","bare","plot","bad","act","bad","visual","effect","thi","film","reli","lame","onelin","idiot","pointless","product","placem","lame","much","annoi","sidekick","gadget","car","thing","take","two","young","kid","see","thei","bore","mind","onli","laugh","receiv","thi","movi","bad","standbi","ne","laugh","show","gui","get","groin"],"filtered2":["disnei","witti","liveact","georg","jungl","high","hope","flick","major","disappoint","thread","bare","plot","bad","act","bad","visual","effect","reli","lame","onelin","idiot","pointless","product","placem","lame","annoi","sidekick","gadget","car","thing","take","two","young","kid","see","bore","mind","onli","laugh","receiv","bad","standbi","ne","laugh","show","gui","get","groin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,9,11,21,28,29,31,32,47,55,106,108,110,114,133,135,181,187,190,211,238,257,271,284,372,404,534,589,635,680,706,841,1031,1428,1882,1936,2143,2275,2737,2839,4568,5812,6993],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,9,11,21,28,29,31,32,47,55,106,108,110,114,133,135,181,187,190,211,238,257,271,284,372,404,534,589,635,680,706,841,1031,1428,1882,1936,2143,2275,2737,2839,4568,5812,6993],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,3.205071257016622,0.9913098153388195,1.162015545335049,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.7064694353107215,1.9536997889255368,2.159084361316692,2.138507503627933,2.1290479736304078,2.4433074195966826,4.642472950759303,2.366244071437088,2.4442286541160034,2.4732161909892554,2.558331832813986,2.5687161421197025,2.597304642813496,2.7602659523229094,2.757740698455715,3.110998680163279,6.141071633100196,3.1419947805322432,3.4272107604888307,3.496027715008137,3.587125145032839,3.8095464139032247,3.6590123745461547,4.30366520516749,4.081705786614497,4.449957298382227,6.0662680901040895,5.1994574154933035,5.00274712124725,5.0768550934009715,5.259176650194926,5.3560264761848435,6.101359409915359,6.342521466732247,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.499322358114068E-5,8.442009440473942E-5,8.50763801400274E-5,0.06227950707908638,8.458619373607503E-5,8.446795914078329E-5,8.471917868632431E-5,8.443225034671629E-5,8.462208482470155E-5,9.388358377540667E-5,0.6928879602575099,8.42959580794017E-5,8.586930033483476E-5,8.709424477269021E-5,8.43574258126662E-5,8.412429828452215E-5,8.62226736743667E-5,8.472711623388004E-5,8.446425068582354E-5,8.453425653215403E-5,0.1565986675367664,8.481105936608159E-5,8.490762962355274E-5,8.499910807130766E-5,8.565143255772703E-5,8.520349967817376E-5,8.87852929417855E-5,8.432101849483211E-5,8.432327427954635E-5,8.453690681808414E-5,8.633371898219843E-5,8.472220702100141E-5,9.094211227307884E-5,8.496051808718422E-5,8.441279813144795E-5,8.480241884031404E-5,8.432821439825984E-5,8.43780461685472E-5,8.412387563724582E-5,8.414570125170854E-5,8.433510299874641E-5,0.03227534307063497,8.479159732476002E-5,8.445635505149857E-5,8.548258832327078E-5,8.448876986207694E-5,8.729591212972992E-5,8.601220029656352E-5,8.416661605854215E-5,8.435262942717335E-5,8.432337275728829E-5,8.669654944179496E-5,8.435388443348809E-5,8.413823103625896E-5,8.506176853296716E-5,8.437561175482273E-5,9.073669732272283E-5,8.430607528718355E-5,8.416564271991228E-5,8.456750896128419E-5,8.540634757629597E-5,8.456191433953846E-5,8.415007188784634E-5,8.434600244203874E-5,8.412489313041295E-5,8.607136879251432E-5,8.484958959477379E-5,8.466884754586376E-5,8.459480081203594E-5,8.49031623081027E-5,8.412182412089378E-5,8.459657430240694E-5,0.049573225930286964,8.427257510234192E-5,8.635827742732799E-5,8.449538322925724E-5,8.515668646703036E-5,8.463624626105005E-5,8.409544945144919E-5,8.419969153676866E-5]}}

{"value":"If you are studying Welles and want to see just how far he fell after Citizen Kane, this film will prove it. The cheap excuse of making the protagonist a self-admitted dummy to explain how he might fall into such a half-baked scheme fails to explain the absurd courtroom theatrics and ridiculous plot twists that eventually ensue. Don't be taken in by the high rating of this film in the db as I was; all I can guess is that there are a lot of die hard old Welles and Hayworth fans out there.","finished_norm":["if","you","be","studi","well","and","want","to","see","just","how","far","he","fall","after","citizen","kane","thi","film","will","prove","it","the","cheap","excus","of","make","the","protagonist","a","selfadmit","dummi","to","explain","how","he","mai","fall","into","such","a","halfbak","scheme","fail","to","explain","the","absurd","courtroom","theatric","and","ridicul","plot","twist","that","eventu","ensu","do","not","be","take","in","by","the","high","rate","of","thi","film","in","the","db","a","i","be","all","i","can","guess","be","that","there","be","a","lot","of","die","hard","old","well","and","hayworth","fan","out","there"],"filtered":["studi","well","want","see","far","fall","citizen","kane","thi","film","prove","cheap","excus","make","protagonist","selfadmit","dummi","explain","mai","fall","halfbak","scheme","fail","explain","absurd","courtroom","theatric","ridicul","plot","twist","eventu","ensu","take","high","rate","thi","film","db","guess","lot","die","hard","old","well","hayworth","fan"],"filtered2":["studi","well","want","see","far","fall","citizen","kane","prove","cheap","excus","make","protagonist","selfadmit","dummi","explain","mai","fall","halfbak","scheme","fail","explain","absurd","courtroom","theatric","ridicul","plot","twist","eventu","ensu","take","high","rate","db","guess","lot","die","hard","old","well","hayworth","fan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,20,31,32,37,46,67,72,101,140,170,171,202,211,215,243,274,293,351,395,435,540,617,716,928,1171,1281,1912,2369,2433,2834,2919,6685,6717,7078],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,20,31,32,37,46,67,72,101,140,170,171,202,211,215,243,274,293,351,395,435,540,617,716,928,1171,1281,1912,2369,2433,2834,2919,6685,6717,7078],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,2.330690080046114,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.655771293751733,1.9570915389266579,1.9209463754160525,2.098582041218749,2.317169775997098,4.814274222781855,2.373087554090762,2.597304642813496,2.5687161421197025,2.605934685587711,2.627841366673578,2.748952192422636,2.9012296278682137,3.0135689919434205,6.306336162260736,3.2829611516442836,3.432149042129413,3.5119855004467477,3.6746621462132825,4.017463517886143,4.297765483040301,4.34596758485818,4.933754249760298,5.089758498236879,5.143104478942172,5.373120909544144,5.3560264761848435,6.600350576034347,6.543192162194399,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.986052681953576E-5,9.918714394170624E-5,9.995822940603667E-5,9.93806696916379E-5,9.938229793202067E-5,9.924338133988958E-5,9.953854506127897E-5,9.920142624232563E-5,9.942446721172741E-5,1.1030601900359531E-4,0.6698690291352403,9.904129326887192E-5,1.0088984989344787E-4,1.0232906577131284E-4,9.911351314673474E-5,9.883960615985151E-5,1.0130503649730634E-4,9.954787107160276E-5,9.923902418939729E-5,9.932127569605224E-5,1.0028226729151097E-4,9.964649782149331E-5,9.975996047627733E-5,9.98674406447018E-5,1.0063387194506227E-4,1.0010758512539271E-4,1.0431591782760475E-4,9.907073733725473E-5,9.907338771149002E-5,9.932438957899551E-5,1.0143550622740581E-4,9.954210312253962E-5,1.0685001531917587E-4,9.982210036953451E-5,9.917857137951826E-5,9.963634586562213E-5,9.907919197254161E-5,0.10541414757129726,9.883910958167864E-5,9.886475300672565E-5,9.908728555041351E-5,0.14585628392606784,9.962363141382611E-5,9.922974742390889E-5,1.0043549290385381E-4,9.926783234320862E-5,1.0256600946714835E-4,1.0105774640165716E-4,9.888932630258068E-5,9.910787776120673E-5,9.907350341529295E-5,1.0186180422287945E-4,9.910935229748707E-5,9.88559760758267E-5,9.994106188706001E-5,9.91348802356383E-5,1.0660866848827731E-4,9.905318021298898E-5,9.8888182704253E-5,9.936034475298474E-5,1.0034591586656506E-4,9.935377150100834E-5,9.886988816937589E-5,9.910009156133239E-5,9.884030505820516E-5,0.07125790102530304,9.969176788860645E-5,9.947940982684443E-5,9.939241058693147E-5,9.975471172284131E-5,9.883669920712097E-5,9.939449430225953E-5,1.0100660701734346E-4,9.901382006207481E-5,1.0146436051913843E-4,9.927560254302985E-5,1.0005258318841558E-4,9.9441105814603E-5,9.880571099094967E-5,9.892818745575669E-5]}}

And whoever compares this to the Evil Dead Series might as well compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones (well, ok, at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider)! 1 out of 10","finished_norm":["what","the","hell","of","a","dmovi","be","that","bad","act","bad","special","effect","and","the","wrong","dialoguesstorylin","i","ever","come","across","the","onli","cool","thing","here","be","coolio","who","have","a","nice","cameo","a","a","freak","out","cop","howev","the","rest","of","the","film","be","aw","and","bore","it","not","even","so","bad","you","can","laugh","about","it","just","plain","crap","and","whoever","compar","thi","to","the","evil","dead","seri","mai","a","good","compar","tomb","raider","to","indiana","jone","good","okai","at","littl","there","be","angelina","joli","in","tomb","raider","out","of"],"filtered":["hell","dmovi","bad","act","bad","special","effect","wrong","dialoguesstorylin","ever","come","across","onli","cool","thing","coolio","nice","cameo","freak","cop","howev","rest","film","aw","bore","even","bad","laugh","plain","crap","whoever","compar","thi","evil","dead","seri","mai","good","compar","tomb","raider","indiana","jone","good","okai","littl","angelina","joli","tomb","raider"],"filtered2":["hell","dmovi","bad","act","bad","special","effect","wrong","dialoguesstorylin","ever","come","across","onli","cool","thing","coolio","nice","cameo","freak","cop","howev","rest","aw","bore","even","bad","laugh","plain","crap","whoever","compar","evil","dead","mai","good","compar","tomb","raider","indiana","jone","good","okai","littl","angelina","joli","tomb","raider"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,9,11,14,21,25,29,34,44,46,106,108,113,133,138,191,203,226,228,262,313,321,394,476,481,482,503,586,1195,1199,1314,1609,3561,4195,4833,5233,5497],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,9,11,14,21,25,29,34,44,46,106,108,113,133,138,191,203,226,228,262,313,321,394,476,481,482,503,586,1195,1199,1314,1609,3561,4195,4833,5233,5497],"values":[1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,3.205071257016622,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,2.159084361316692,2.138507503627933,2.1521782565202803,2.3212364753796515,2.2907365189289424,2.5460113484259455,2.569760528637609,2.5940874818617203,2.7742700004069256,2.726701583487816,2.907069060519773,3.09496984188738,3.0967381889441223,3.6105180246075443,3.353630724994973,6.630933444098431,3.3490645070153917,3.4572130107926293,4.422928625994308,4.291900363587903,4.409683399244287,4.621379564718146,12.350934764138163,12.429376190444724,6.137727054086234,6.437831646536572,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.12931173453987,9.284238419857972E-5,9.356414520594757E-5,9.302353057817538E-5,9.30250546639911E-5,9.289502422752878E-5,9.317130704537887E-5,9.2855752895254E-5,9.306452647769926E-5,1.0325001193467637E-4,0.570380406946933,9.27058632376489E-5,9.443617220241329E-5,9.578332494991015E-5,9.277346338602352E-5,9.2517077561205E-5,9.482480033160094E-5,9.31800364935625E-5,9.289094579332915E-5,9.296793587166289E-5,9.386745517801191E-5,0.11876674434945036,9.337855905617219E-5,9.347916398029881E-5,9.419656853921731E-5,9.370394700412072E-5,9.764308292483888E-5,9.273342384077275E-5,9.273590467703081E-5,9.297085056710706E-5,9.494692423119925E-5,9.317463750613653E-5,1.0001508037893812E-4,9.343672401197767E-5,9.283436000229185E-5,9.326285177074262E-5,9.274133765365585E-5,9.279614096079424E-5,9.251661274792702E-5,9.254061582560189E-5,9.274891350508642E-5,9.372721801329292E-5,9.325095063142546E-5,9.288226243990886E-5,9.401087932155371E-5,9.291791115978607E-5,9.600511193527913E-5,9.459332878038602E-5,9.256361722763984E-5,9.27681884823666E-5,0.057934630980299336,9.534595298337412E-5,9.276956869615654E-5,9.253240033357114E-5,9.354807585129911E-5,9.279346367435078E-5,0.11658825555042797,9.271698980293555E-5,9.256254678250865E-5,9.300450577628817E-5,9.392703230891848E-5,9.299835299921268E-5,9.254542250441881E-5,9.27609003467126E-5,9.251773175273514E-5,9.465840030479322E-5,9.331472858205596E-5,9.31159545476976E-5,9.303452043702565E-5,9.33736460526951E-5,9.25143565591524E-5,9.303647086216504E-5,9.454546065779018E-5,9.268014742490079E-5,9.497393278424714E-5,9.292518431887135E-5,9.365246340693701E-5,9.308010074971995E-5,9.248535058360889E-5,9.259999252760497E-5]}}

{"value":"I've found the movie offensive for Americans which lost somebody in the towers, for American people in general. Pretending to be an homage to horrible facts happened last years, each director takes the opportunity to polemize with old facts (which have none to do with a terrorist attack), or criticize American's political behaviour, or compare different political situation as they have in own country having this nothing to do or to share with the atrocity of September 11.

If you like amateur splatter like this one (Only way better) I would recommend Andreas Schnass' Violent Shit 2 and 3.","finished_norm":["thi","be","not","a","funni","and","gori","a","the","dvd","box","claim","i","realli","love","twist","and","wierd","movi","but","thi","on","be","realli","just","dull","it","on","hour","of","rip","off","peni","fly","babi","bear","doll","and","a","lot","of","rape","i","think","the","intent","with","thi","amateur","sleaz","be","to","make","a","itssobaditsgood","movi","but","it","fail","it","just","bad","a","few","scene","be","okai","but","in","whole","it","a","mess","if","you","like","amateur","splatter","like","thi","on","onli","wai","well","i","would","recommend","andrea","schnass","violent","shit","and"],"filtered":["thi","funni","gori","dvd","box","claim","realli","love","twist","wierd","movi","thi","realli","dull","hour","rip","peni","fly","babi","bear","doll","lot","rape","think","intent","thi","amateur","sleaz","make","itssobaditsgood","movi","fail","bad","scene","okai","whole","mess","like","amateur","splatter","like","thi","onli","wai","well","recommend","andrea","schnass","violent","shit"],"filtered2":["funni","gori","dvd","box","claim","realli","love","twist","wierd","realli","dull","hour","rip","peni","fly","babi","bear","doll","lot","rape","think","intent","amateur","sleaz","make","itssobaditsgood","fail","bad","scene","okai","whole","mess","like","amateur","splatter","like","onli","wai","well","recommend","andrea","schnass","violent","shit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,9,11,12,13,19,20,33,54,62,72,111,174,191,215,247,298,367,407,435,525,652,654,698,746,751,811,824,966,1158,1488,1757,2394,3919,4591,5069,6875],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,9,11,12,13,19,20,33,54,62,72,111,174,191,215,247,298,367,407,435,525,652,654,698,746,751,811,824,966,1158,1488,1757,2394,3919,4591,5069,6875],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.4018535447685214,1.8113893252729412,2.0226120445069267,1.9209463754160525,2.1183455303375887,2.456282578459816,2.5460113484259455,2.605934685587711,2.7303758068497004,2.7819920465008363,3.0791938792932125,3.120015873813468,3.2829611516442836,3.4149707055943286,3.7810747398219124,3.634471265630037,3.90413483257914,4.00861390260916,3.8023521382691974,3.8425769395797067,3.8767358583910254,4.026392148630444,8.572138886554221,4.581533656170946,4.944927550358424,5.290429193699031,5.878215858601149,6.0662680901040895,6.255510089742618,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.867443730172907E-5,9.800905250280321E-5,9.877097942956426E-5,9.820027965817776E-5,9.820188855919878E-5,9.806462194348004E-5,9.835627986926504E-5,9.80231651659533E-5,9.824355697492828E-5,1.0899586355921652E-4,0.6820528100714228,9.786493416565471E-5,0.20875755103449228,1.0111365627825416E-4,9.793629625473112E-5,9.766564258741613E-5,1.001017898720645E-4,9.836549511026446E-5,9.806031654487302E-5,9.814159111246131E-5,9.909116856767488E-5,9.846295042477461E-5,9.857506543129573E-5,9.868126900820598E-5,9.943859705064836E-5,9.891856118218096E-5,1.0307690957663386E-4,9.789402851326213E-5,9.789664740778068E-5,9.814466801038121E-5,1.0023070995302642E-4,9.835979566979165E-5,1.0558090842395003E-4,9.863646726039103E-5,9.800058176088874E-5,9.845291904836387E-5,9.79023827289477E-5,9.79602358340033E-5,9.766515190733118E-5,9.769049075359599E-5,9.791038017566367E-5,9.894312722041272E-5,9.844035561197385E-5,9.805114996380538E-5,9.924257424877514E-5,9.80887825309595E-5,1.0134778568457116E-4,9.985743695489463E-5,9.771477218108662E-5,9.793072780327525E-5,9.78967617373162E-5,1.006519446106628E-4,9.793218482580834E-5,9.768181807035193E-5,9.87540158171256E-5,9.795740955686848E-5,1.053424281806352E-4,9.787667992305602E-5,9.771364216580352E-5,0.10157834283078689,9.915406115925781E-5,9.817370094975973E-5,9.769556492355186E-5,9.792303408368664E-5,9.766633318463182E-5,9.992612970236245E-5,9.850768279842885E-5,9.829784701127423E-5,9.821188110144476E-5,9.856987901972421E-5,9.766277016190342E-5,9.821394006752518E-5,9.980690497662627E-5,9.783778727080128E-5,1.0025922152903283E-4,9.809646044053501E-5,9.886421252856798E-5,9.825999795344628E-5,9.763215000706274E-5,9.775317176242936E-5]}}
{"value":"This movie is one of the most awful I've ever seen. Not only is the dialogue awful, it never ends. You'll think it's ending, but it's not. How long is it, 140, 160 minutes? I don't even know. I do know that I'll never watch it again. It's like someone took a romantic comedy, took out the comedy, then decided to downplay the romance, leaving us with the pile of crap that managed to make its way to the screen. But don't take my word for it, find out for yourself how terrible this film is.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","on","of","the","much","aw","i","have","ever","see","not","onli","be","the","dialogu","aw","it","never","end","you","will","think","it","end","but","it","not","how","long","be","it","minut","i","do","not","even","know","i","do","know","that","i","will","never","watch","it","again","it","like","someon","take","a","romant","comedi","take","out","the","comedi","then","decid","to","downplai","the","romanc","leav","u","with","the","pile","of","crap","that","manag","to","make","it","wai","to","the","screen","but","do","not","take","my","word","for","it","find","out","for","yourself","how","terribl","thi","film","be"],"filtered":["thi","movi","much","aw","ever","see","onli","dialogu","aw","never","end","think","end","long","minut","even","know","know","never","watch","like","someon","take","romant","comedi","take","comedi","decid","downplai","romanc","leav","u","pile","crap","manag","make","wai","screen","take","word","find","terribl","thi","film"],"filtered2":["aw","ever","see","onli","dialogu","aw","never","end","think","end","long","minut","even","know","know","never","watch","like","someon","take","romant","comedi","take","comedi","decid","downplai","romanc","leav","u","pile","crap","manag","make","wai","screen","take","word","find","terribl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,7,11,12,24,26,31,33,38,42,44,59,74,99,112,127,138,139,166,192,248,249,258,313,345,864,892,1131],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,7,11,12,24,26,31,33,38,42,44,59,74,99,112,127,138,139,166,192,248,249,258,313,345,864,892,1131],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.6420723132238515,2.6649848339420377,4.221200943435452,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,3.2439908614907673,1.604729392502474,1.8693254449200722,1.9486336368009016,2.056430207256609,2.2466628996789315,4.871935874217273,4.581473037857885,2.2939035841256437,2.4423870329693536,2.5318267134339894,2.689504733779216,2.6754694156628323,2.7061321952397077,2.907069060519773,3.0022328381570844,3.9782428047328615,3.9825254665248626,4.197121957260614]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.644896957860768E-4,1.6338050331283956E-4,1.646506309347576E-4,1.6369927783513465E-4,1.6370195986349718E-4,1.6347313723751028E-4,1.6395932925236084E-4,1.6340402903775643E-4,1.63771420862867E-4,1.816954515177366E-4,0.9869821640749871,1.6314025890828054E-4,1.6618519094002655E-4,1.6855585920565988E-4,1.6325921908321364E-4,1.628080410413881E-4,1.6686908396901638E-4,1.6397469100389486E-4,1.6346596016382766E-4,1.6360144438105066E-4,1.6518438430961367E-4,1.6413714842929163E-4,1.6432404347343886E-4,1.6450108419984247E-4,1.6576354550915492E-4,1.648966488321515E-4,1.7182859069146518E-4,1.6318875901142685E-4,1.6319312469289848E-4,1.6360657355144826E-4,1.6708399297157088E-4,1.6396519007077422E-4,1.7600274176753626E-4,1.6442639995465914E-4,1.6336638263681958E-4,1.641204261849167E-4,1.6320268543892143E-4,1.6329912621842926E-4,1.6280722308062635E-4,1.6284946278553514E-4,1.6321601713468122E-4,1.6493760027069942E-4,1.6409948301172682E-4,1.6345067952810836E-4,1.6543677667287907E-4,1.6351341279208334E-4,1.6894615152323242E-4,1.6646174912010505E-4,1.628899397796828E-4,1.6324993650799937E-4,1.631933152795492E-4,1.6778618862207446E-4,1.6325236535583246E-4,1.6283500547452864E-4,1.6462235269445777E-4,1.632944148313788E-4,1.7560519663075588E-4,1.6315983901549525E-4,1.6288805605097623E-4,1.6366579871097611E-4,1.6528922588296912E-4,1.636549712874449E-4,1.628579213964503E-4,1.6323711112354116E-4,1.62809192262809E-4,1.6657625951856965E-4,1.6421171702816467E-4,1.6386192202818352E-4,1.6371861737155214E-4,1.643153977564229E-4,1.628032527252682E-4,1.6372204965567214E-4,1.6637751261508788E-4,1.6309500519720718E-4,1.6713152159794994E-4,1.6352621182134445E-4,1.6480604995220202E-4,1.6379882787555237E-4,1.6275220911060573E-4,1.6295395165171476E-4]}}
{"value":"DEAD HUSBANDS is a somewhat silly comedy about a bunch of wives conspiring to bump off each others husbands`. It`s by no means embarrassingly bad like some comedies I could mention but it never fufils its potential . Imagine how good this could have been if we had the Farrelly brothers directing Ben Stiller in the role of Carter Elson .<br /><br />Oh is Carter based on Jerry Springer ?

{"value":"This movie is a good example of how to ruin a book in 109 minutes. Except for the names of the characters the movie bears very little resemblance to the book.

And to delete a complete generation is inexcusable. Isabel Allende has written a powerful book and the book is what should be read!","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","a","good","exampl","of","how","to","ruin","a","book","in","minut","except","for","the","name","of","the","charact","the","movi","bear","veri","littl","resembl","to","the","book","a","book","full","of","strong","latino","charact","and","thei","be","repres","for","the","much","part","by","nonlatino","there","be","no","charact","develop","in","the","movi","and","we","have","no","reason","to","love","or","hate","the","charact","and","to","delet","a","complet","gener","be","inexcus","isabel","allend","have","write","a","power","book","and","the","book","be","what","should","be","read"],"filtered":["thi","movi","good","exampl","ruin","book","minut","except","name","charact","movi","bear","veri","littl","resembl","book","book","full","strong","latino","charact","thei","repres","much","part","nonlatino","charact","develop","movi","reason","love","hate","charact","delet","complet","gener","inexcus","isabel","allend","write","power","book","book","read"],"filtered2":["good","exampl","ruin","book","minut","except","name","charact","bear","veri","littl","resembl","book","book","full","strong","latino","charact","repres","part","nonlatino","charact","develop","reason","love","hate","charact","delet","complet","gener","inexcus","isabel","allend","write","power","book","book","read"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,14,15,54,59,61,65,95,103,143,145,151,225,233,307,320,336,339,366,525,631,710,1053,1349,3659,4016,4149,6934],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,14,15,54,59,61,65,95,103,143,145,151,225,233,307,320,336,339,366,525,631,710,1053,1349,3659,4016,4149,6934],"values":[0.6786144649922705,4.495548096411346,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.3409902041158843,2.34599021453259,14.001227434050932,2.641219492619754,2.6102777977348763,2.8767855639325206,2.938298364153555,2.9233055795674137,3.003844442051426,3.185521045582134,3.4149707055943286,3.607563812710113,3.6528204042982337,4.067587905068712,4.470719289830655,5.7446844659766265,6.489124940924123,6.389041482367141,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1947347534980207E-4,1.186678377748999E-4,1.1959036705798446E-4,1.1889937264308458E-4,1.1890132067543959E-4,1.1873512039015925E-4,1.1908825527452952E-4,1.1868492516814062E-4,0.07767871162078151,1.3197049787426818E-4,0.6778028276286789,1.184933415317836E-4,1.2070496099097298E-4,1.2242684378273799E-4,1.1857974564031793E-4,1.1825204238571091E-4,1.2120169166185453E-4,1.190994129451329E-4,1.1872990748042889E-4,1.1882831346391208E-4,1.1997804709088253E-4,1.1921741032555102E-4,1.1935315743325414E-4,1.1948174707384414E-4,1.2039870809925925E-4,1.1976905675073047E-4,1.2480392036876554E-4,1.1852856851575985E-4,1.1853173943254703E-4,1.1883203892410055E-4,1.213577860925509E-4,1.1909251215117395E-4,1.2783572326261915E-4,1.1942750181377916E-4,1.1865758153221955E-4,1.1920526449087383E-4,1.1853868367029298E-4,1.1860873131089554E-4,1.1825144827788889E-4,1.182821281591975E-4,1.1854836685450167E-4,0.1000894851866309,1.1919005287732023E-4,1.1871880872651478E-4,1.2016136673681513E-4,1.1876437365403992E-4,1.2271032402969134E-4,1.209058329468271E-4,1.1831152773428592E-4,1.1857300344582517E-4,1.1853187786097202E-4,1.2186781047031059E-4,1.1857476758606707E-4,1.1827162740909333E-4,1.1956982777964697E-4,1.1860530929845915E-4,1.2754697508983795E-4,1.1850756311232386E-4,1.1831015952934084E-4,1.1887505581706228E-4,1.200541964634621E-4,1.1886719155594747E-4,1.1828827188533085E-4,1.1856368800970258E-4,1.1825287855008825E-4,1.2098900505802151E-4,0.13533177869280041,1.19017505678082E-4,1.1891341949031356E-4,1.1934687780671675E-4,1.1824856449753571E-4,1.1891591245444876E-4,1.2084464961277309E-4,1.1846047249333976E-4,1.2139230746572854E-4,1.1877366994764434E-4,1.197032522454778E-4,1.189716786270131E-4,1.1821149008987145E-4,1.1835802135067178E-4]}}
{"value":"From the pen of Richard Condon (The Manchurian Candidate 1962) comes this muddled tale of political intrigue and assassination. The story, told in almost comic book fashion is difficult to swallow. All-star cast considered, this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and crew: the novel was replete with the same short-comings. It seems as though at times the story is actually mocking the more sincere effort put forth in \"Manchurian Candidate.\" A disappointment on all counts.","finished_norm":["from","the","pen","of","richard","condon","the","manchurian","candid","come","thi","muddl","tale","of","polit","intrigu","and","assassin","the","stori","tell","in","almost","comic","book","fashion","be","difficult","to","swallow","allstar","cast","consid","thi","poor","effort","be","not","entir","the","fault","of","the","cast","and","crow","the","novel","be","replet","with","the","same","shortcom","it","seem","a","though","at","time","the","stori","be","actual","mock","the","much","sincer","effort","put","forth","in","manchurian","candid","a","disappoint","on","all","count"],"filtered":["pen","richard","condon","manchurian","candid","come","thi","muddl","tale","polit","intrigu","assassin","stori","tell","almost","comic","book","fashion","difficult","swallow","allstar","cast","consid","thi","poor","effort","entir","fault","cast","crow","novel","replet","shortcom","seem","though","time","stori","actual","mock","much","sincer","effort","put","forth","manchurian","candid","disappoint","count"],"filtered2":["pen","richard","condon","manchurian","candid","come","muddl","tale","polit","intrigu","assassin","stori","tell","almost","comic","book","fashion","difficult","swallow","allstar","cast","consid","poor","effort","entir","fault","cast","crow","novel","replet","shortcom","seem","though","time","stori","actual","mock","sincer","effort","put","forth","manchurian","candid","disappoint","count"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,17,34,35,52,86,90,92,131,146,151,159,187,198,317,401,474,480,575,641,769,803,820,884,1017,1037,1298,1809,2064,2216,2530,2713,2927,3652,3791,4258,6837,7629],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[8,17,34,35,52,86,90,92,131,146,151,159,187,198,317,401,474,480,575,641,769,803,820,884,1017,1037,1298,1809,2064,2216,2530,2713,2927,3652,3791,4258,6837,7629],"values":[0.9418936859054116,2.5541073880211935,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.7122153074726136,2.031112399272319,2.0477128419653545,4.0979070738271774,2.2512118082053005,2.326138445979858,2.8002454868101863,2.300267965194495,2.4732161909892554,2.5439726117360975,2.8529247828056143,6.175855118523935,3.6466665387238555,3.43462735814388,3.6314455447135003,3.7034641371169887,3.857614816944247,3.7636829971100436,3.900174431363043,3.9323057095458362,4.0536665665501035,4.062925891962901,4.3521595551061,5.014723312293965,4.911775343041523,5.02684467282631,5.156897801074508,5.426230734858092,5.3560264761848435,11.489368931953253,5.770002273960917,5.878215858601149,6.660975197850782,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.18363413839674E-5,8.128449980224049E-5,0.042509227917646206,8.144309539393627E-5,8.144442974735961E-5,8.13305867102797E-5,8.157247527062583E-5,8.129620423908318E-5,8.147898774219409E-5,9.039648913727399E-5,0.5085561626950265,8.116497424160809E-5,8.267987823635448E-5,8.385932486714416E-5,8.122415889412021E-5,8.099969036386162E-5,8.30201263176891E-5,8.158011799582382E-5,8.132701599754159E-5,0.11066403176021639,8.218196040220441E-5,8.166094324911155E-5,8.175392662149067E-5,8.184200730797739E-5,8.247010266798893E-5,8.203880724814607E-5,8.548756285403143E-5,8.118910384425142E-5,8.11912758429142E-5,8.139697348112427E-5,8.312704709722784E-5,8.157539112462005E-5,8.75642719805038E-5,8.180485066205123E-5,8.127747453261602E-5,8.165262365624688E-5,8.119603247202508E-5,8.124401335324335E-5,8.099928341486813E-5,8.102029836595279E-5,8.120266521093443E-5,8.205918126543121E-5,8.164220408155778E-5,8.131941362880163E-5,8.230752977300412E-5,8.135062446412024E-5,0.33204135350388553,8.281747050029098E-5,8.104043633930994E-5,8.121954065958262E-5,8.119137066292183E-5,8.347640103516497E-5,8.122074905150947E-5,8.101310561486059E-5,8.19023403876699E-5,8.12416693603433E-5,8.736648670663832E-5,8.117471566845372E-5,8.10394991531551E-5,8.142643897651886E-5,8.223412081716138E-5,8.142105215441931E-5,8.102450666463789E-5,8.12131598189112E-5,8.100026311553922E-5,8.287444131548995E-5,8.169804235908761E-5,8.152401356721671E-5,8.14527171328355E-5,8.174962523442903E-5,8.099730809747849E-5,8.145442475089407E-5,8.27755614472732E-5,8.114245977265859E-5,8.315069337412853E-5,8.135699219264567E-5,8.199373280847909E-5,8.149262318382899E-5,8.097191305583148E-5,8.107228330326229E-5]}}
{"value":"Not to be confused with the Madonna film \"The Next Best Thing\", \"The Last Big Thing\" is a silly, campy, off-the-wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called \"The Next Big Thing\" which reviews a variety of up and coming artists.

{"value":"Just had to write that one liner, but it really is. I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I've seen in recent years . I have praises for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important one, the script . It is a weak story about a petty criminal. No amount of fine acting or black and white film styling can make up for a total lack of substance. I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he's gonna do another film about the general. My advice is don't waste your time.","finished_norm":["just","have","to","write","that","on","liner","but","it","realli","be","i","love","the","gangster","genr","and","thi","be","the","weak","entri","i","have","see","in","recent","year","i","have","prais","for","everyon","involv","in","much","aspect","except","the","much","import","on","the","script","it","be","a","weak","stori","about","a","petti","crimin","no","amount","of","fine","act","or","black","and","white","film","styl","can","make","up","for","a","total","lack","of","substanc","i","love","kevin","spacei","and","i","hear","he","gonna","do","anoth","film","about","the","gener","my","advic","be","do","not","wast","your","time"],"filtered":["write","liner","realli","love","gangster","genr","thi","weak","entri","see","recent","year","prais","everyon","involv","much","aspect","except","much","import","script","weak","stori","petti","crimin","amount","fine","act","black","white","film","styl","make","total","lack","substanc","love","kevin","spacei","hear","gonna","anoth","film","gener","advic","wast","time"],"filtered2":["write","liner","realli","love","gangster","genr","weak","entri","see","recent","year","prais","everyon","involv","aspect","except","import","script","weak","stori","petti","crimin","amount","fine","act","black","white","styl","make","total","lack","substanc","love","kevin","spacei","hear","gonna","anoth","gener","advic","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,8,13,17,21,54,57,65,73,77,89,183,184,216,225,229,233,241,246,359,379,380,464,467,562,600,645,772,1033,1283,1353,1439,1485,1645,1705,2305,2662,3668,4282],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,8,13,17,21,54,57,65,73,77,89,183,184,216,225,229,233,241,246,359,379,380,464,467,562,600,645,772,1033,1283,1353,1439,1485,1645,1705,2305,2662,3668,4282],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9418936859054116,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,3.6227786505458823,1.834162586674748,1.9073850067444174,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,1.9940046109572438,2.4885128563647294,2.496249838866882,2.6070186965339692,2.641219492619754,2.8432628718938773,2.6102777977348763,2.6627744961815836,2.673149229007135,3.2189558216683714,6.254577266285095,3.102062070196872,3.2872346624216657,3.342254038012865,3.432149042129413,3.558633189238533,3.558633189238533,3.7398317812878634,4.2574141875167335,4.3773181147422555,4.436351646326448,4.477736862489302,4.679973728984199,4.662879295624898,5.00274712124725,5.089758498236879,5.695894301807195,5.822646007446338,5.9370563586240825]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.585723959746246E-5,9.521085182126354E-5,9.595102540594748E-5,9.539661935895141E-5,9.539818232515501E-5,9.52648347304639E-5,9.55481656967909E-5,9.522456156179946E-5,9.54386610896603E-5,1.0588398468774511E-4,0.717744573560209,9.507084812474193E-5,9.684529835963482E-5,9.822681782113627E-5,9.514017279542493E-5,9.487724640693779E-5,9.724384063686154E-5,9.555711783868887E-5,9.526065225284232E-5,9.533960639650436E-5,9.626207300619397E-5,9.565179076197579E-5,9.576070483674982E-5,0.13396293724228653,9.659958225626989E-5,9.609439363593326E-5,1.0013401939187168E-4,9.509911181618826E-5,9.51016559401398E-5,9.534259544766278E-5,9.73690799939597E-5,9.555158111969748E-5,0.08852109922284941,9.582035361716611E-5,9.52026229226808E-5,9.564204578568415E-5,9.510722751541613E-5,9.516342888939321E-5,9.487676973598069E-5,9.4901385147266E-5,9.511499663158222E-5,9.611825830318788E-5,9.56298410408167E-5,9.525174738161409E-5,9.640915598985735E-5,9.528830552275991E-5,9.845426273201539E-5,9.700646410076976E-5,9.492497332953878E-5,9.513476332565759E-5,9.510176700551781E-5,9.777828822060847E-5,9.513617874956953E-5,9.489296007286568E-5,9.593454611195364E-5,9.516068330368844E-5,1.0233485646350563E-4,9.508225853570812E-5,9.492387557667896E-5,9.537710922240065E-5,9.632316998718648E-5,9.537079948411161E-5,9.490631444748315E-5,9.512728926507851E-5,9.487791728730538E-5,9.707319564069732E-5,9.569524600708681E-5,9.549140112207472E-5,9.540788957601402E-5,9.575566649946352E-5,9.48744559904112E-5,9.540988975772563E-5,9.695737483225543E-5,9.504447628543429E-5,9.739677755218536E-5,9.529576422470858E-5,0.05247964928703609,9.545463267115709E-5,9.48447100541856E-5,9.496227658628764E-5]}}
{"value":"Blank Check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties. The plot is completely pointless; its overtones of lonliness are pathetic.

The notion, let alone the bargain-basement price, will only be believed by the most gullible viewers.

{"value":"I'm sorry but this is just plain pathetic. The little girl was a brat, their were no enjoyable characters and the plot sucked. Besides it wasn't even a gator as the film would like us to believe. If you check out any complete guide to reptiles you will find that it really is a Crocodile, not a gator. Obviously they didn't hire a real animal expert or they would know that the creature is a croc. It is a sad excuse for a movie. Especially the ending.

Especially the scene in romania when he becomes the werewolf, that must be the worst scene that has ever been made. This movie isn't funny, it isn't scary and not entertaining at all. Please do yourself (and me, i don't think anyone should suffer through this movie) a favour and DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE!!

This is not a step forward for Christians in the arts, it is a step forward for those who believe we check our brains at the door.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","youth","pastor","wife","and","we","take","some","youth","to","see","thi","film","we","then","spend","a","hour","try","to","explain","it","to","them","thei","do","not","get","it","and","i","do","not","enjoi","it","it","be","base","on","a","concept","that","have","run","through","all","three","of","the","major","religion","of","the","world","the","bibl","code","the","torah","code","and","the","code","in","the","koran","and","be","so","question","a","to","be","laughabl","thi","be","not","a","step","forward","for","christian","in","the","art","it","be","a","step","forward","for","that","who","believ","we","check","our","brain","at","the","door"],"filtered":["youth","pastor","wife","take","youth","see","thi","film","spend","hour","try","explain","thei","get","enjoi","base","concept","run","three","major","religion","world","bibl","code","torah","code","code","koran","question","laughabl","thi","step","forward","christian","art","step","forward","believ","check","brain","door"],"filtered2":["youth","pastor","wife","take","youth","see","spend","hour","try","explain","get","enjoi","base","concept","run","three","major","religion","world","bibl","code","torah","code","code","koran","question","laughabl","step","forward","christian","art","step","forward","believ","check","brain","door"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,31,36,91,137,165,174,200,224,263,283,334,378,382,395,404,504,552,673,684,699,726,838,1060,1471,1640,1823,2159,7693],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,31,36,91,137,165,174,200,224,263,283,334,378,382,395,404,504,552,673,684,699,726,838,1060,1471,1640,1823,2159,7693],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.4070669811451506,1.4680183469605717,2.0105926690411424,2.2939035841256437,2.448847599972298,2.456282578459816,2.5308211829319704,2.689504733779216,2.902686292364678,2.7678802023081546,2.942840385588056,3.130944944345658,3.235085203598255,3.153168081130368,3.1419947805322432,3.41740676039221,3.424750734647968,3.7297814454343623,4.1302590120314875,7.162722880632177,3.7034641371169887,3.9363956947973615,8.321128723053633,4.9227044135737135,9.377263583454626,14.937649871511168,5.274680836730892,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0272982499402672E-4,1.0203709376781945E-4,1.0283033487448069E-4,1.022361801040877E-4,1.0223785512879361E-4,1.020949470383508E-4,1.0239859171566875E-4,1.0205178644259168E-4,1.022812360608032E-4,1.1347544809677795E-4,0.6215850228858354,1.0188705235933972E-4,1.0378872366613566E-4,1.0526929261535503E-4,1.0196134733504465E-4,1.0167957016318968E-4,1.042158398502043E-4,1.0240818569077553E-4,1.0209046469360659E-4,1.0217507953746204E-4,1.0316368335887601E-4,1.0250964628865817E-4,1.0262636907233009E-4,1.0273693747452294E-4,1.0352539068885721E-4,1.0298398204018244E-4,1.0731323300434125E-4,1.0191734244580746E-4,1.0192006897339583E-4,1.0217828289178032E-4,1.043500583744502E-4,1.0240225201090517E-4,1.0992014286270156E-4,1.0269029443466062E-4,1.0202827488971648E-4,1.024992026360638E-4,1.0192604000860903E-4,0.2570859032847747,1.0167905931680804E-4,1.017054395558397E-4,1.0193436613971245E-4,1.0300955770980221E-4,1.0248612285920402E-4,1.0208092137828984E-4,1.0332131161141897E-4,0.1134030660317056,1.0551304442782651E-4,1.0396144435422715E-4,1.0173071891759668E-4,1.0195555002766501E-4,1.0192018800172267E-4,1.0478860521437879E-4,1.0195706693187981E-4,1.0169641043688799E-4,1.028126740802087E-4,1.019833283657242E-4,1.0967186139963782E-4,1.0189928085169555E-4,1.0172954246019346E-4,1.0221527116782075E-4,1.03229160752043E-4,1.022085090462229E-4,1.0171072226740929E-4,1.0194754010646857E-4,1.0168028914302933E-4,1.0403296028194558E-4,1.0255621710317434E-4,1.0233775734519302E-4,1.0224825835119088E-4,1.0262096950616424E-4,1.0167657968482165E-4,1.0225040193802952E-4,1.0390883557908675E-4,1.0185878976333528E-4,1.0437974173818186E-4,1.0212809405514633E-4,1.0292739972943411E-4,1.0229835274159783E-4,1.0164470108247952E-4,1.0177069667048848E-4]}}
