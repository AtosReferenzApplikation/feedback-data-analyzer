{"value":"Susan Swift is an appealing youngster, a flower child transplanted to the 1980's (like a young Susan Dey), but she doesn't quite have the vocal range for a demanding dramatic lead and she tends to whine; still, she's rather sweet and has bright eyes and a pretty smile. In \"The Coming\" (as it was called when briefly released to theaters), Swift may be the reincarnation of a Salem witch. The flick is very low-budget and borrows from so many other pictures that I gave up on it with about 15 minutes to go. It starts out strong and has some camp appeal. Obviously, there are more serious films that deal with the Salem witch trials that deserve to be seen over this one; however, as junk movies go, it isn't too terrible. The Boston locales are a definite plus, and the supporting cast is amusingly hammy. *1/2 from

I'm a \"B\" movie pervert and from certain people point of view all the flicks I love are put aside by \"regular viewers\" but take my word on this one, Vampire club makes the top of my list of the best of worst.It's hard to Imagine, vampires with no fangs, the music score is totally out of place,the sound effects are just not effective and finally Mr.Savage doesn't seem to know he is in a vampire movie at all witch is too bad 'cause he had a \"not to bad\" career over all.

{"value":"Whoo-boy, that was definitely one of the worst flicks I've seen all summer. Granted, it was on Sci Fi, and I don't watch much Sci Fi, but man, talk about a razor thin plot and two dimensional characters to the max.<br /><br />The characters were stereotypical and overdone, the plot and setting were unbelievable, the vampires were less intimidating, more funny-looking, the gore was unnecessary, the special effects were down-right horrible, and the ending? Well, the only thing unpredictable about the ending was when suddenly the tomboy becomes a lesbian and starts to do it with the female vampire, which, by the way, isn't really all that hot considering

{"value":"A 1957 (yes, that's the correct date) J. Arthur Rank production with James Robertson Justice, Margaret Rutherford, Wilfred Hyde White; it has to be a smash comedy, right? Oh, it's just awful. It's a one gag film: watching people be shocked at the sight of a little alligator. Music is thrown in, most inappropriately and forgettably. Jeannie Carson is a lively dancer and competent singer. But what was she doing in this film? Diana Dors is here too, providing oh-so-daring shots for use in the previews. Her acting level is not bad, but she's in the film to provide someone to leer at. Well, one must do something beside groan during this film. The movie is being sold on VHS now by people on e-Bay. Spare yourself the expense and the waste of time. A comedy without a laugh.

{"value":"Well, finally got to see the remake last night in London, unintentionally hilarious, sexless and devoid of any real humour. I don't really know where to start, whilst I was entertained by this strange homage, it didn't really move me. The acting is screamingly hammy, there is no original music, the costumes are far too 'Disney' there is a ridiculous 'six months later' insert after the burning of Nic Cage (which didn't come soon enough for my liking) The bit with Cage in the bear suit had the audience suppressing mirth as did the comedy punching out of various 'baddies' on the island. It's such a weird remake that I cant quite believe I saw it, it reminded me of something that The Comic Strip presents would have done in the eighties, a bit like their Hollywood interpretation of the

{"value":"The killings in this movie isn't that bad, but for sure the movie is. It's even worse than that. It's not even worth the wear it might cause when you slide it into your DVD-player.<br /><br />Not even the wear it causes on your shoulders carrying it from the DVD-store, not to speak of the money and time you spend renting and watching it. Horrible.<br /><br />It's beyond understanding how anyone could say anything positive about this movie. It was just a bare masochistic tendency of mine that caused me not to stop watching, add to that the group pressure from my co-watchers.<br /><br />The manuscript is awful, the directing even worse

{"value":"Lauren Bacall and Charles Boyer do not provide the right chemistry here in this 1945 film.<br /><br />There is a good story here about the Axis trying to obtain coal to use for the upcoming war. Unfortunately, this part of the story is not emphasized. Instead, we deal with a supposedly bungling Boyer. By the way, Bacall is as British as Vladimir Putin.<br /><br />The real acting kudos goes to veteran Oscar winner Katina Paxinou. As was the case with her memorable Pilar in the 1943 Oscar winner, \"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\" Paxinou again plays a Spanish revolutionary but this time she is a double-crossing counter-spy for the pro-Franco group. She is quite a vicious character here;especially, when she throws a 14 year old child out the window. She believed that Boyer had given the child important material to hide.","finished_norm":["lauren","bacal","and","charl","boyer","do","not","provid","the","right","chemistri","here","in","thi","filmbr","br","there","be","a","good","stori","here","about","the","axi","try","to","obtain","coal","to","us","for","the","upcom","war","unfortun","thi","part","of","the","stori","be","not","emphas","instead","we","deal","with","a","supposedli","bungl","boyer","by","the","wai","bacal","be","a","british","a","vladimir","putinbr","br","the","real","act","kudo","go","to","veteran","oscar","winner","katina","paxin","a","be","the","case","with","her","memor","pilar","in","the","oscar","winner","for","whom","the","bell","toll","paxin","again","plai","a","spanish","revolutionari","but","thi","time","she","be","a","doublecross","counterspi","for","the","profranco","group","she","be","quit","a","viciou","charact","hereespeci","when","she","throw","a","year","old","child","out","the","window","she","believ","that","boyer","have","give","the","child","import","materi","to","hide"],"filtered":["lauren","bacal","charl","boyer","provid","right","chemistri","thi","filmbr","br","good","stori","axi","try","obtain","coal","us","upcom","war","unfortun","thi","part","stori","emphas","instead","deal","supposedli","bungl","boyer","wai","bacal","british","vladimir","putinbr","br","real","act","kudo","go","veteran","oscar","winner","katina","paxin","case","memor","pilar","oscar","winner","bell","toll","paxin","plai","spanish","revolutionari","thi","time","doublecross","counterspi","profranco","group","quit","viciou","charact","hereespeci","throw","year","old","child","window","believ","boyer","give","child","import","materi","hide"],"filtered2":["lauren","bacal","charl","boyer","provid","right","chemistri","filmbr","good","stori","axi","try","obtain","coal","us","upcom","war","unfortun","part","stori","emphas","instead","deal","supposedli","bungl","boyer","wai","bacal","british","vladimir","putinbr","real","act","kudo","go","veteran","oscar","winner","katina","paxin","case","memor","pilar","oscar","winner","bell","toll","paxin","plai","spanish","revolutionari","time","doublecross","counterspi","profranco","group","quit","viciou","charact","hereespeci","throw","year","old","child","window","believ","boyer","give","child","import","materi","hide"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,8,10,17,21,30,33,36,40,56,57,61,67,80,91,120,121,152,180,227,288,310,314,410,468,537,566,600,695,696,707,946,979,1074,1132,1224,1357,1668,1901,1947,2339,3406,3671,3924,4063,4085,5898,5973,7226,7881,8502],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,8,10,17,21,30,33,36,40,56,57,61,67,80,91,120,121,152,180,227,288,310,314,410,468,537,566,600,695,696,707,946,979,1074,1132,1224,1357,1668,1901,1947,2339,3406,3671,3924,4063,4085,5898,5973,7226,7881,8502],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.6284968758320737,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,1.8818517047392527,1.9570915389266579,1.9951803900462557,2.0105926690411424,2.2044500422972613,2.2190595059394194,2.3131195476980753,5.419462958538709,2.6005321873043625,2.8015621426949333,2.854312708080462,3.189397019426827,3.2070272508030975,3.304513710030018,3.424750734647968,3.439602492783994,3.558633189238533,3.6715125373103863,3.8095464139032247,3.6375061693251913,3.9612932464190886,8.19205168077849,4.110553940952155,4.218628162481577,4.5432147918688095,4.477736862489302,4.9676558014359795,4.85885294158718,5.089758498236879,10.341768086098496,5.719991853386255,5.7446844659766265,5.822646007446338,5.822646007446338,5.822646007446338,6.437831646536572,13.897314540605125,6.725513718988353,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612973E-4,2.1169300653874423E-4,2.1174527517734863E-4,2.1170270760391532E-4,2.1172274275403047E-4,2.116918393273702E-4,2.1175767842838492E-4,2.1166034303434324E-4,2.1169305127789707E-4,2.1191181310725393E-4,2.1359327166515902E-4,2.1169340094007543E-4,2.1189388796841969E-4,2.1191596365579453E-4,2.1181969576676937E-4,2.117035414702398E-4,2.1177637567609508E-4,2.1187603835847048E-4,2.1171447081128576E-4,2.1171369676217488E-4,2.1190416541618464E-4,2.1173490831315574E-4,2.1173522875558994E-4,2.1187086861014428E-4,2.117145471820264E-4,2.1191849657461963E-4,2.1176752792775858E-4,2.116925320907912E-4,2.117885044381763E-4,2.1185314534259388E-4,2.117359469071496E-4,2.1184934806943337E-4,2.119533608105546E-4,2.1215008639459355E-4,2.117671619875167E-4,2.1170341306868588E-4,2.1177974410483173E-4,2.117249135272619E-4,2.1166056894252467E-4,2.117144052467594E-4,2.1192657926066667E-4,2.1181032419177905E-4,2.118498308375968E-4,2.1167110326541507E-4,2.11714459080

acting was horrendous, and this film was just an unnecessary movie in the Tremor saga, because even though it tells the story of how the graboids were formed, the story is so dumb and useless.Also, if you want to tell a story WAY back in time, make sure you use the SAME ACTOR(Michael Gross), to be someone in the past, when he's someone in the present in the other Tremor movies.Geez...If you haven't seen this film, don't waste your time.Stick to Tremors, 1, 2, and 3, for a good time.This film however, make sure you're remote is sitting right next to you with the STOP button working for a quick retreat away from this nonsense.","finished_norm":["i","find","tremor","the","legend","begin","to","be","dull","and","boringal","the","action","scene","be","stupidth","so","call","graboid","be","reduc","to","the","size","of","a","modern","dai","hous","cat","if","not","smallerth","act","be","horrend","and","thi","film","be","just","a","unnecessari","movi","in","the","tremor","saga","becaus","even","though","it","tell","the","stori","of","how","the","graboid","be","form","the","stori","be","so","dumb","and","uselessalso","if","you","want","to","tell","a","stori","wai","back","in","time","make","sure","you","us","the","same","actormichael","gross","to","be","someon","in","the","past","when","he","someon","in","the","present","in","the","other","tremor","moviesgeezif","you","have","not","see","thi","film","do","not","wast","your","timestick","to","tremor","and","for","a","good","timethi","film","howev","make","sure","you","re","remot","be","sit","right","next","to","you","with","the","stop","button","work","for","a","quick","retreat","awai","from","thi","nonsens"],"filtered":["find","tremor","legend","begin","dull","boringal","action","scene","stupidth","call","graboid","reduc","size","modern","dai","hous","cat","smallerth","act","horrend","thi","film","unnecessari","movi","tremor","saga","becaus","even","though","tell","stori","graboid","form","stori","dumb","uselessalso","want","tell","stori","wai","back","time","make","sure","us","actormichael","gross","someon","past","someon","present","tremor","moviesgeezif","see","thi","film","wast","timestick","tremor","good","timethi","film","howev","make","sure","re","remot","sit","right","next","stop","button","work","quick","retreat","awai","thi","nonsens"],"filtered2":["find","tremor","legend","begin","dull","boringal","action","scene","stupidth","call","graboid","reduc","size","modern","dai","hous","cat","smallerth","act","horrend","unnecessari","tremor","saga","becaus","even","though","tell","stori","graboid","form","stori","dumb","uselessalso","want","tell","stori","wai","back","time","make","sure","us","actormichael","gross","someon","past","someon","present","tremor","moviesgeezif","see","wast","timestick","tremor","good","timethi","howev","make","sure","re","remot","sit","right","next","stop","button","work","quick","retreat","awai","nonsens"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,8,17,19,21,22,33,37,38,48,56,63,68,86,89,90,113,119,121,129,132,139,142,147,155,213,244,297,315,367,411,420,440,689,729,792,883,905,1081,1173,1377,1656,1681,2013,2191,2549,4192,4241,6402],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,8,17,19,21,22,33,37,38,48,56,63,68,86,89,90,113,119,121,129,132,139,142,147,155,213,244,297,315,367,411,420,440,689,729,792,883,905,1081,1173,1377,1656,1681,2013,2191,2549,4192,4241,6402],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,3.83116108203179,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.6955116224012472,1.8610609350701788,1.8729627573220065,2.0064197866819473,2.031112399272319,1.9940046109572438,4.095425683930709,2.1521782565202803,4.3306817978619945,2.2190595059394194,2.4106958340079214,2.253494045787767,4.587807168251287,2.2844323215331563,2.2844323215331563,2.3074766467914385,2.8432628718938773,2.634508058031767,2.813490713560207,2.854312708080462,3.0791938792932125,3.229006157521873,3.3023374306074227,3.212973749990824,3.607563812710113,3.7952092507568174,4.115443926246347,3.8614098879127985,3.9121030022283168,4.1302590120314875,4.2574141875167335,4.558366596889411,4.760735085628657,4.662879295624898,4.9227044135737135,5.014723312293965,5.185068678041204,5.9370563586240825,27.79462908121025,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079186E-4,1.9803239209117182E-4,1.9808128781854337E-4,1.9804146714364084E-4,1.9806020941939232E-4,1.980313002003047E-4,1.9809289068399737E-4,1.9800183637269834E-4,1.9803243394329344E-4,1.9823707900490465E-4,1.9981003252786644E-4,1.9803276104166453E-4,1.9822031058076088E-4,1.982409617172787E-4,1.9815090602457098E-4,1.9804224720031642E-4,1.9811038139259517E-4,1.9820361281160012E-4,1.980524712676425E-4,1.9805174716815743E-4,1.9822992482167873E-4,1.9807158993126703E-4,1.9807188969545297E-4,1.981987766687143E-4,1.9805254271015586E-4,1.9824333118607744E-4,1.981021045921645E-4,1.980319482594903E-4,1.9812172748195033E-4,1.981821970890387E-4,1.9807256150447284E-4,1.9817864485507643E-4,1.9827594562220606E-4,1.984599764441484E-4,1.9810176226615832E-4,1.9804212708455403E-4,1.9811353245559538E-4,1.980622401119633E-4,1.9800204770295573E-4,1.9805240993401509E-4,1.982508922939222E-4,1.9814213920018063E-4,1.9817909647006264E-4,1.9801190224276861E-4,1.980524602937

{"value":"Dire. Just dire. The script is contrived, the acting painful, and the story just drags along. It is, without a doubt, a celebration of Sally Potter and little else. This wouldn't be so bad, but she's the director, writer and star of the film, and so is just self-glorification. I found myself not caring about the developing romance between the principal two characters, and the ending came not a moment too soon. It has two redeeming features. First is that a lot of the shots are really quite lovely, particularly in Paris, and look rather good in black and white. Secondly, whether you're a fan of tango or not, the music is by and large, excellent (except where Sally starts singing). Watch this film at your own risk, or if you need an unintentional laugh.

{"value":"Saw it at UCSB's reel loud festival and was *shocked* that it won the golden reel award. I wasn't the only one, considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece. I thought there were many other better flicks out there, but then I learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap. While the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there, the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece. Seems as though \"serious\" student films need to include one of these categories: sex, intrapersonal struggle, and eventual suicide -- Nick and Kate cops out and includes all three. Please, be more original!<br /><br />Oh, and it might be my outsider's opinion, but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake.

{"value":"This movie could have been 15 minutes long if it weren't for all the bickering between son and father. Very predictable. Both Male \"stars\" need a good slap in the face! Would you like some cheese with that \"whine?\" Two chuckles...and a headache. I can understand why the mother left her hubby after 47 years...I don't know how she lasted that long! The first 5 minutes made me want to turn the movie off wishing I had never paid the $3.99 to watch it! The movie didn't flow well and was painfully long. I kept watching my watch hoping time would fly faster...It didn't. The script had so much repetition that it had to be easy for the writer to fill space. On a positive note...the scenery was pretty, fall being my favorite season. The car, the 40 Ford was also quite nice.

{"value":"All I can say after watching Snitch'd is please stop Mr. Cahill. It is painfully clear you have no understanding of what you make movies about. If you insist on making movies about gangsters I urge you to do research. It's comical to watch movies with absurd gangbangers that even sound more absurd when they speak.<br /><br />I laughed at the part when Mr. Cahill goes to a school with only 3 students and proceeds to kick their butts in kung fu fashion. This movie was tough as an after school special. Who had the idea to have hats worn that say where a particular gangbanger was from?. I suspect real gangbangers do not wear hats claiming there gang. That would be stupid considering new laws that add length to a prison term if a person is gang related. <br /><br />Snitch'd is the WORST gangbanger movie ever

{"value":"\" It had to be You\" is another sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas. This picture is about Charlie Hudson a former police officer turned Author. When Charlie's fiancé goes out of town he's stuck with all of the wedding planning. He spends a week at a fancy hotel and meets Anna Penn a teacher who just happens to also be getting married. The two quickly become friends and set out to plan their separate weddings together. This is when the plot gets boring, Charlie falls in love with Anna and she has to choose between a safe life or Charlie. This movie rips off every romantic comedy ever made and just has you waiting for the end of the movie so you can do something else. Micahel Vartan and Natasha Henstridge give really mediocre performances which just makes this movie all the more gut wrenching to

{"value":"i bought this DVD because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; \"Rated R for strong violence and sexuality, nudity and language\".<br /><br />which correctly, IMO, should state ; \"Rated R for strong violence, sexuality, nudity and language\".<br /><br />the word \"sexuality\" should come after a \"comma\", not an \"and\" because of the huge difference in meaning it make. i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts ALMOST non-existent. my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like \"vivid\" movie. that is why i felt cheated. story-wise, it was so-so, after-all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it. i know i don't.<br /><br />of

{"value":"My children watch the show everyday that its on. Its a great program for younger children. However they need to stop showing re-runs and do some more actual shows and get rid of Rooney's and Deedee's YELLOW TEETH. Moe is the only Doodle bop with clean white pearlie teeth and the children notice these things and ask if the 2 don't ever brush their teeth? Does the show ever make its way to the United States and if so where can we find its schedule at. And one other thing if we might be able to add. Moe you need to stop hiding so much. Sometimes when you pop up out of no where you scare the younger children and whats with the pulling of the rope? What does that signify? other then getting wet all the time. They need to add newer things to their show instead of the same ole same ole. Kids loose interest that way.","finished_norm":["my","child","watch","the","show","everydai","that","it","on","it","a","great","program","for","young","child","howev","thei","ne","to","stop","show","rerun","and","do","some","much","actual","show","and","get","rid","of","roonei","and","deede","yellow","tooth","moe","be","the","onli","doodl","bop","with","clean","white","pearli","tooth","and","the","child","notic","thi","thing","and","ask","if","the","do","not","ever","brush","their","tooth","doe","the","show","ever","make","it","wai","to","the","unit","state","and","if","so","where","can","we","find","it","schedul","at","and","on","other","thing","if","we","mai","be","abl","to","add","moe","you","ne","to","stop","hide","so","much","sometim","when","you","pop","up","out","of","no","where","you","scare","the","young","child","and","what","with","the","pull","of","the","rope","what","doe","that","signifi","other","then","get","wet","all","the","time","thei","ne","to","add","new","thing","to","their","show","instead","of","the","same","ol","same","ol","kid","loos","interest","that","wai"],"filtered":["child","watch","show","everydai","great","program","young","child","howev","thei","ne","stop","show","rerun","much","actual","show","get","rid","roonei","deede","yellow","tooth","moe","onli","doodl","bop","clean","white","pearli","tooth","child","notic","thi","thing","ask","ever","brush","tooth","doe","show","ever","make","wai","unit","state","find","schedul","thing","mai","abl","add","moe","ne","stop","hide","much","sometim","pop","scare","young","child","pull","rope","doe","signifi","get","wet","time","thei","ne","add","new","thing","show","instead","ol","ol","kid","loos","interest","wai"],"filtered2":["child","watch","show","everydai","great","program","young","child","howev","ne","stop","show","rerun","actual","show","get","rid","roonei","deede","yellow","tooth","moe","onli","doodl","bop","clean","white","pearli","tooth","child","notic","thing","ask","ever","brush","tooth","doe","show","ever","make","wai","unit","state","find","schedul","thing","mai","abl","add","moe","ne","stop","hide","sometim","pop","scare","young","child","pull","rope","doe","signifi","get","wet","time","ne","add","new","thing","show","instead","ol","ol","kid","loos","interest","wai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,8,11,18,28,29,33,38,44,46,51,52,60,87,110,113,114,135,152,180,299,306,315,359,454,498,500,544,623,688,707,940,952,1212,1428,1481,1495,2929,3275,3436,3520,3542,3835,3875,4395,4432,4905,5666,6017],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,8,11,18,28,29,33,38,44,46,51,52,60,87,110,113,114,135,152,180,299,306,315,359,454,498,500,544,623,688,707,940,952,1212,1428,1481,1495,2929,3275,3436,3520,3542,3835,3875,4395,4432,4905,5666,6017],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.5932680941439847,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,2.430631986809635,7.726147096759545,3.9586154332014196,2.803707089537043,1.519311641348122,3.209458785004948,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,1.838176641236591,2.115024371522662,6.387143920891223,2.1521782565202803,2.4433074195966826,4.732488142874176,2.3131195476980753,10.838925917077418,5.589992261848085,2.8739486825973213,5.708625416160924,3.2189558216683714,3.2556198060399626,3.386191741044285,3.3814747511661465,3.4222967456864013,3.607563812710113,3.6016814428070463,3.6375061693251913,3.952924996748572,3.9868265484242533,13.652285992512578,4.671389985292807,4.597282013139085,4.5432147918688095,5.390512652256013,5.5623629091826725,5.626901430320244,5.695894301807195,5.672363804397,5.770002273960917,11.591955520728355,5.9370563586240825,5.967828017290836,6.660975197850782,13.321950395701563,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6606027355064843E-4,1.659131191470251E-4,1.659540843777912E-4,1.6592072229843714E-4,1.659364247266965E-4,1.6591220435213918E-4,1.6596380535110363E-4,1.6588751932213695E-4,1.6591315421106672E-4,1.6608460747753195E-4,1.674024404972318E-4,1.6591342825669352E-4,1.6607055875790836E-4,1.6608786044495775E-4,1.6601241106661968E-4,1.6592137583614777E-4,1.6597845920640936E-4,1.6605656923359365E-4,1.6592994164138055E-4,1.659293349850509E-4,1.660786136457076E-4,1.65945959410405E-4,1.6594621055523323E-4,1.6605251747447308E-4,1.6593000149648865E-4,1.6608984560483473E-4,1.6597152483692812E-4,1.6591274730129885E-4,1.6598796505065615E-4,1.6603862697025262E-4,1.6594677340219367E-4,1.660356508802787E-4,1.6611717023981074E-4,1.662713527317012E-4,1.659712380334671E-4,1.6592127520220307E-4,1.6598109919214844E-4,1.6593812605714513E-4,1.658876963763138E-4,1.6592989025557785E-4,1.6609618036135353E-4,1.6600506615115275E-4,1.6603602924691977E-4,1.6589595258844584E-4,1.6592993244734548E-4,1.6592121280946856E-4,1.6597737563565112E-4,1.6600615

In addition to having atrocious acting, even from John Barrymore,this is perhaps the greatest example of how far Hollywood (especially early Hollywood) would go to revise and change a famous novel just to beef up its chances at the box office.All of the novel's beautiful,poetic language has been absolutely eradicated, and Ahab has been changed from a brooding,blasphemous,obsessive madman to a dashing,misunderstood hero who only wants to kill Moby Dick after his fiance(!) turns away from him after seeing his wooden leg. To this is added the standard evil brother who wants the fiance for himself, and a different ending!","finished_norm":["thi","version","of","mobi","dick","insult","the","audienc","by","claim","it","be","base","on","melvil","noveleven","go","so","far","a","to","show","a","phoni","chapter","sentenc","rather","than","the","famou","call","me","ishmael","in","addit","to","have","atroci","act","even","from","john","barrymorethi","be","perhap","the","great","exampl","of","how","far","hollywood","especi","earli","hollywood","would","go","to","revis","and","chang","a","famou","novel","just","to","beef","up","it","chanc","at","the","box","officeal","of","the","novel","beautifulpoet","languag","have","be","absolut","erad","and","ahab","have","be","chang","from","a","broodingblasphemousobsess","madman","to","a","dashingmisunderstood","hero","who","onli","want","to","kill","mobi","dick","after","hi","fianc","turn","awai","from","him","after","see","hi","wooden","leg","to","thi","be","add","the","standard","evil","brother","who","want","the","fianc","for","himself","and","a","differ","end"],"filtered":["thi","version","mobi","dick","insult","audienc","claim","base","melvil","noveleven","go","far","show","phoni","chapter","sentenc","rather","famou","call","ishmael","addit","atroci","act","even","john","barrymorethi","perhap","great","exampl","far","hollywood","especi","earli","hollywood","go","revis","chang","famou","novel","beef","chanc","box","officeal","novel","beautifulpoet","languag","absolut","erad","ahab","chang","broodingblasphemousobsess","madman","dashingmisunderstood","hero","onli","want","kill","mobi","dick","hi","fianc","turn","awai","see","hi","wooden","leg","thi","add","standard","evil","brother","want","fianc","differ","end"],"filtered2":["version","mobi","dick","insult","audienc","claim","base","melvil","noveleven","go","far","show","phoni","chapter","sentenc","rather","famou","call","ishmael","addit","atroci","act","even","john","barrymorethi","perhap","great","exampl","far","hollywood","especi","earli","hollywood","go","revis","chang","famou","novel","beef","chanc","box","officeal","novel","beautifulpoet","languag","absolut","erad","ahab","chang","broodingblasphemousobsess","madman","dashingmisunderstood","hero","onli","want","kill","mobi","dick","fianc","turn","awai","see","wooden","leg","add","standard","evil","brother","want","fianc","differ","end"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,11,21,24,28,37,51,76,96,101,142,155,160,168,204,220,222,266,267,278,291,299,300,307,318,321,334,375,381,474,486,616,654,709,751,865,891,1094,1185,1219,1378,1863,1924,2679,3582,4523,5958],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,11,21,24,28,37,51,76,96,101,142,155,160,168,204,220,222,266,267,278,291,299,300,307,318,321,334,375,381,474,486,616,654,709,751,865,891,1094,1185,1219,1378,1863,1924,2679,3582,4523,5958],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,0.9913098153388195,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,2.975308642954861,1.7139899308309823,2.1337665533324026,2.0390708128715254,4.197164082437498,2.2844323215331563,2.3074766467914385,2.3722295531801256,2.4894767118610357,2.624524614047584,2.8336934208777267,2.5771019354959765,2.747702973022204,2.7085302779237206,5.667386841755453,3.016831637578237,2.7949961309240425,5.864548499100348,2.8767855639325206,2.902686292364678,3.09496984188738,2.942840385588056,3.2597778161886266,3.24941502915308,7.293333077447711,3.3066947359763783,3.5173618574831282,3.634471265630037,3.6497387377608255,3.8023521382691974,7.8402703478511615,3.8767358583910254,4.218628162481577,4.235066888824737,4.246178114249808,4.5432147918688095,10.0054942424945,4.869215728622727,5.290429193699031,5.695894301807195,6.032366538428407,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479613003E-4,2.1169300653874453E-4,2.1174527517734895E-4,2.1170270760391562E-4,2.1172274275403077E-4,2.116918393273705E-4,2.1175767842838522E-4,2.1166034303434357E-4,2.1169305127789737E-4,2.1191181310725423E-4,2.135932716651461E-4,2.1169340094007576E-4,2.1189388796841998E-4,2.1191596365579486E-4,2.1181969576676966E-4,2.117035414702401E-4,2.1177637567609538E-4,2.118760383584708E-4,2.1171447081128606E-4,2.1171369676217518E-4,2.1190416541618494E-4,2.1173490831315607E-4,2.1173522875559027E-4,2.118708686101446E-4,2.1171454718202668E-4,2.1191849657461995E-4,2.117675279277589E-4,2.1169253209079152E-4,2.117885044381766E-4,2.1185314534259418E-4,2.117359469071499E-4,2.1184934806943367E-4,2.119533608105549E-4,2.1215008639459388E-4,2.1176716198751704E-4,2.1170341306868618E-4,2.1177974410483202E-4,2.1172491352726219E-4,2.1166056894252497E-4,2.1171440524675973E-4,2.11926579260667E-4,2.1181032419177934E-4,2.118498308375971E-4,2.1167110326541537E-4,2.117144590803697E-4,2.1170333346011983E-4,2.1177499311905113E-4,2.1181171516755477E-4,2.11768644

{"value":"This movie could have been so much better with a script rewrite. Not that I expect a great deal of plausibility in movies, but you'd think that even the homeless and urban-dwelling Jack Mason would question why a group of experienced hunters would want to hire him as a hunting guide. And upon reaching the hunting grounds, poor Ice-T plays his part as if he is actually going to lead these men through woods he's never seen before.<br /><br />And how does Jack Mason find Thomas Burns back in Seattle?<br /><br />I'm assuming this movie was based on Richard Connell's short story \"The Most Dangerous Game.\" A few years ago I showed this movie to a class of 9th grade students after they read the story. I reedited the movie, cutting out all the pointless scenes and all the profanity.

{"value":"OK maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie. Its about this pampered rat, who lives in a palace. Then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet! He ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants. He will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats.He plans to take the gem and to flood rat city! THe cool part about this movie is the slugs. They do all the sound effects. They sing, make noises, its awesome, its also pretty funny. OK bottom line, it is aimed at 7 year olds. Other wise, a great movie to take a younger family member to see. I didn't think the animation was real dreamworks art though, more like WAllace and Gromit. i thinkthey slacked a little on that.

{"value":"This was such a waste of time. Danger: If you watch it you will be tempted to tear your DVD out of the wall and heave it thru the window.<br /><br />An amateur production: terrible, repetitive, vacuous dialog; paper-thin plot line; wooden performances; Lucy Lawless was pathetically hackneyed.<br /><br />Seriously flawed story, completely unbelievable characters. The two worst concepts in film and t.v. are: (1) the evil twin, (2) amnesia. There are no twins.<br /><br />The plot \"twist\"? Outrageously simplistic and obvious - like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies. It doesn't even resolve properly.

{"value":"Horror/Sci-Fi that is interesting as it is laughable. F/X pretty good...for what you manage to see. A made for TV thriller that is not as bad as the worst of them. Jeffrey Coombs plays a brilliant although misguided scientist that tampers with stem cell research and manipulates human DNA with that of a hammerhead shark. The horrifying results give birth to one hell of a killing machine. A group of scientists led by William Forsythe and Hunter Tylo are invited to a remote island to check out the brilliant new experiment. Of course, after laughing and stammering in awe...Coombs' creation, by the way is his own son fused with a hammerhead, is let loose to hunt down one by one his father's colleagues. Revenge is not always rewarding. Also in the cast: Elsie Muller, G.R.

{"value":"...because this was simply awful. 101 Dalamatians was funny even if formulaic, but this is nothing more than puerile drivel. The same plot except with the story excised from it; the world's most intelligent and horribly annoying macaw; Tim McInnerny proving that he really can't do comedy (everone remembers Percy in Blackadder but that was his high spot - it's all been downhill since then); direction so poor that if a group of college students had made this you'd throw it in the bin and tell them to do it again - properly this time. Ieuan Grufford better go back to Hornblower sharpish, whilst Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu ought to go into hiding for several years.<br /><br />Perhaps I could be too harsh; after all I didn't manage to sit through the whole film.

{"value":"Terry West had a good idea w\\ this movie. He just didn't flesh it thru. There are endless shots of the creepy looking school's exteriors that go on forever and probably to pad the film's running time. Also at this school there are only 2 students. Misty Mundae is good as usual but this film will always belong to Ruby LaRocca (which is the only reason to watch the film in the beginning). If the script centered on her interesting character we'd have a movie to watch. She is so GORGEOUS!! Good news for DVD buyers, Terry West's earlier (and better) film \"Blood For The Muse\" is a special feature. One thing I'd like to say is that this movie feels like someone who's not good at delivering the punch line at the end of a long joke for the ending feels that very same way.

{"value":"\"Sir\" John Gielgud must have become senile to star in a mess of a movie like this one.;<br /><br />This is one of those films, I suppose, that is considered \"art,\" but don't be fooled.....it's garbage. Stick to the \"art\" you can admire in a frame because the films that are labeled as such are usually unintelligible forgeries like this.<br /><br />In this masterpiece, Giegud recites Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\" while the camera pans away to nude people. one of them a little kid urinating in a swimming pool. Wow, this is heady stuff and real \"art,\" ain't it?? That's just one example. Most of the story makes no sense, is impossible to follow and, hence, is one that Liberal critics are afraid to say they didn't \"understand\" so they give it high marks to save their phony egos. You want Shakespeare?

{"value":"I saw this movie the other night. I can't even begin to express how much this movie sucked. The writing, the voice acting, even the claymation. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. It's like watching 24 hours of C-Span for the sake of comedy. It just doesn't work. It literally falls flat at about every spot possible.<br /><br />Also, the movie's animation is very poor quality. I know that this is an movie made by one person, but to think that he could make 97 minutes worth of crap, maybe he could at least make 1 second worth of funny.<br /><br />This show may take the cake for being the worst film of all time. Yikes. It really was that bad. If you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh, steer clear from this abomination. My advice: Don't even buy it, or look it up for that matter.

{"value":"The photography on the DVD is so dark I thought the screen had died. I think I missed seeing half of the movie. Still, it was poorly crafted and not interesting. I did not find the story related to the title \"The Black Widow\". I was hoping for a mystery or a thriller but did not get involved enough to care after the first few frames. I rented the movie especially for Willem Dafoe and was sad it wasted his talent. I do not believe Giada Colagrande has studied movie making long enough to develop a major motion picture. She is attractive and might develop into an actor but she took on too many tasks in this movie. Although they are married in real life, they lack chemistry on the screen. Their relationships did not seem believable.

{"value":"I bought this movie exciting a gloriously gratuitous, over the top, entertaining bloodbath. I got none of them. This film fails on practically every level, not in the least frightening, or funny, it is simply terrible film-making, and never provides the audience with anything worth seeing. What is so bad about it is that far from being as raw, violent and brutal as it had promised to be, there is very little violence at all. Virtually no blood shed, and no excitement whatsoever. Acting, direction and dialogue is absolutely unbearable. Honestly, it is truly laughable. I could hardly sit through this total garbage once; I certainly will never want to watch it again. Don't waste your time with a waste of celluloid like this; it is truly possibly the worst film ever made.

{"value":"Mark Hamill should have felt mighty embarrassed with CORVETTE SUMMER! This time, he uses a new kind of \"force\" to regain the possession of his dream machine, a bright red 'Vette. It looks like another sour teen-age flick the first half-hour and does a U-turn in heading for the wrong direction. The writing and directing jobs are dreadfully done, with a few scenes you can't hardly take. You're expecting this to happen anyway, and you're also sniffing the smell of late-70s hodgepodge. Only a former newcomer like Annie Potts would easily steal the show and save this poor movie from the repo creeps! Her impractical but delightful personality holds on to your interest for good, and this is the finest chance to see her in a swimsuit. Hooray for Annie! Sorry, Mark!

{"value":"(Review in English, since Swedish is not allowed)<br /><br />I saw this movie with extremely low expectations, and I can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them.<br /><br />As much as I loved to see Janne \"Loffe\" Karlsson on the big screen again, the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water, isn't original or funny. The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable, the ones that ain't, is just plain boring. I smiled like three times during the entire film.<br /><br />The placement of Swedish Findus products is (unintentionally) funny, why not just a big sign saying; \"Findus made it happen!\".<br /><br

{"value":"Exceptionally horrible tale that I can barely put into words. The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end, alive and well, only to be massacred again. There is the chance that I missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on. The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film. I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a 'Euro-trash, sexy horror flick.' I get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out. All the good stuff more than likely. I got the PG-13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new 'Planet of the Apes' movie. Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff.

{"value":"This movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half-hour or so. None of them generate any interest or positive response. I waited for the intrigue to begin, hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end, but there was no reward for doing that.<br /><br />If you want a synopsis, look elsewhere. To me the action isn't worth recounting. Not that the story was that bad, I guess you could say I had some problems with the script--i.e. I thought it stunk. A look at the credits will show you that there's a pretty strong cast here, used to no avail. Most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs; of the actors I hadn't seen much of before I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger.

{"value":"When HEY ARNOLD! first came on the air in 1996, I watched it. It was one of my favorite shows. Then the same episodes started getting shown over and over again so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it. I was sort of surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD! THE MOVIE since it doesn't seem to be nearly as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS. Nevertheless, having nothing better to do, I went to see the movie anyway. Going into the theater, I wasn't expecting much. I was just expecting it to be a dumb movie version of a childrens' cartoon like the RECESS movie was. I guess I got what I expected. It was a dumb kiddie movie and nothing more. There were some good parts here and there, but for the most part, the movie was a stinker. Simply for kids.","finished_norm":["when","hei","arnold","come","on","the","air","in","i","watch","it","it","be","on","of","my","favorit","show","then","the","same","episod","start","get","show","over","and","over","again","so","i","get","tire","of","wait","for","new","episod","and","stop","watch","it","i","be","sort","of","surpris","when","i","hear","about","hei","arnold","the","movi","sinc","it","doe","not","seem","to","be","nearli","a","popular","a","some","of","the","other","nickelodeon","cartoon","like","spongebob","squarep","nevertheless","have","noth","well","to","do","i","go","to","see","the","movi","anywai","go","into","the","theater","i","be","not","expect","much","i","be","just","expect","it","to","be","a","dumb","movi","version","of","a","children","cartoon","like","the","recess","movi","be","i","guess","i","get","what","i","expect","it","be","a","dumb","kiddi","movi","and","noth","much","there","be","some","good","part","here","and","there","but","for","the","much","part","the","movi","be","a","stinker","simpli","for","kid"],"filtered":["hei","arnold","come","air","watch","favorit","show","episod","start","get","show","get","tire","wait","new","episod","stop","watch","sort","surpris","hear","hei","arnold","movi","sinc","doe","seem","nearli","popular","nickelodeon","cartoon","like","spongebob","squarep","nevertheless","noth","well","go","see","movi","anywai","go","theater","expect","much","expect","dumb","movi","version","children","cartoon","like","recess","movi","guess","get","expect","dumb","kiddi","movi","noth","much","good","part","much","part","movi","stinker","simpli","kid"],"filtered2":["hei","arnold","come","air","watch","favorit","show","start","get","show","get","tire","wait","new","stop","watch","sort","surpris","hear","hei","arnold","sinc","doe","seem","nearli","popular","nickelodeon","cartoon","like","spongebob","squarep","nevertheless","noth","well","go","see","anywai","go","theater","expect","expect","dumb","version","children","cartoon","like","recess","guess","get","expect","dumb","kiddi","noth","good","part","part","stinker","simpli","kid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,18,20,28,34,35,49,61,71,87,114,130,162,201,216,220,243,269,315,326,331,386,420,424,611,653,679,822,900,951,974,1929,2464,2761,4308],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,18,20,28,34,35,49,61,71,87,114,130,162,201,216,220,243,269,315,326,331,386,420,424,611,653,679,822,900,951,974,1929,2464,2761,4308],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,2.389902141215977,1.9416538289407692,1.9218995441445863,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,3.0904588387038183,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,3.3840606616174704,3.7637034094785053,1.9214926742550966,2.115024371522662,2.4433074195966826,6.792641710259891,2.3586007221245198,2.561435818751577,2.6070186965339692,2.8336934208777267,2.627841366673578,2.76533567167316,2.854312708080462,2.942840385588056,2.932274249550174,3.0433232530252132,6.604674861214845,3.212973749990824,3.520060914452293,7.982292419137539,3.6715125373103863,3.813163054373413,3.9201351739255808,4.004218291136122,8.061773076436568,4.8184434032493035,5.156897801074508,11.540004547921834,5.999576715605417]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.234407602816468E-4,2.2324275812784234E-4,2.232978784893338E-4,2.232529884731002E-4,2.2327411672029337E-4,2.232415272346224E-4,2.2331095844892418E-4,2.2320831253640867E-4,2.2324280530791707E-4,2.2347350255652826E-4,2.252466997550514E-4,2.2324317404730245E-4,2.2345459944065019E-4,2.23477879554708E-4,2.2337635938917753E-4,2.2325386783430932E-4,2.2333067579914025E-4,2.2343577597443506E-4,2.2326539346890402E-4,2.2326457718847384E-4,2.234654376153404E-4,2.232869460197478E-4,2.2328728394518994E-4,2.2343032416998463E-4,2.232654740063533E-4,2.2348055066696412E-4,2.233213453268013E-4,2.2324225779449947E-4,2.2334346629394194E-4,2.2341163393927894E-4,2.2328804127835623E-4,2.234076294908204E-4,2.2351731705956912E-4,2.237247757880989E-4,2.2332095942123814E-4,2.2325373242729934E-4,2.233342280058665E-4,2.2327640592866816E-4,2.2320855076990692E-4,2.232653243272449E-4,2.2348907433600602E-4,2.2336647651074405E-4,2.2340813859831577E-4,2.2321965983456386E-4,2.2326538109796097E-4,2.2325364847537192E-4,2.2332921781121294E-4,2.233679433767198E-4,2.2332252276763845E-4,2.2328712575322486E-4,2.2325420056448962E-4,2.2371161216552603E-4,2.233103777523481E-4,2.2326532992581908E-4,2.2330918184256576E-4,2.2324248620167713E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.232773157576044E-4,2.232545139848126E-4,2.2324235876917291E-4,2.2342095801135606E-4,2.2333127123814602E-4,2.2324226544800528E-4,2.2321956888982685E-4,2.2319712169645208E-4,2.2339892722621766E-4,2.2325320192525616E-4,2.233546845271628E-4,2.2342023346478749E-4,2.2331887205251057E-4,2.232656256333525E-4,2.2321986151580708E-4,2

{"value":"*****Warning: May contain SPOILERS********* My HUGE problem with this movie is how totally self-centered and self consumed the adulteress wife is!! After having a one night stand with a slimy psycho she is being stalked by him. He calls her constantly and threatens her and even sends a video of their night together. He is OBVIOUSLY crazy and very dangerous. The problem is she only thinks he is dangerous to HER (and exposing her secret). Not for one second did she ever have one thought of concern for her husband! Did she even for a moment think of him possibly being in danger from this psychotic?? As soon as she realized how mental he was she should have warned her husband no matter what the consequences.
