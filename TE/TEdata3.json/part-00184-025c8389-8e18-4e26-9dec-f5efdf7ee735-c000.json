{"value":"this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the British film industry but the talentless hacks at work today. Not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of British actors, so what went wrong? i don't know and simply i don't care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all. be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish. but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot. A nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his father's company and thus leads to an encounter with the Russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid, very stupid plot twists/devices. i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience. if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather, what about lock, stock.... thats the peak of the contemporary British crime film.....","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","quit","simpli","on","of","the","wrong","film","ever","make","and","be","a","damn","indict","on","not","onli","the","british","film","industri","but","the","talentless","hack","at","work","todai","not","onli","do","the","film","get","mainstream","distribut","it","conjur","featur","a","good","cast","of","british","actor","so","what","go","wrong","i","do","not","know","and","simpli","i","do","not","care","enough","to","engag","with","the","debat","becaus","the","film","be","so","terribl","it","deserv","no","think","at","all","be","warn","and","stai","the","hell","awai","from","thi","rubbish","but","appar","i","ne","to","write","ten","line","of","text","in","thi","review","so","i","mai","a","good","detail","the","plot","a","nob","of","a","man","be","setup","by","hi","evil","friend","and","cowork","out","of","hi","father","compani","and","thu","lead","to","a","encount","with","the","russian","mafia","and","dodgi","accent","and","stupid","veri","stupid","plot","twistsdevic","i","should","have","ask","for","my","monei","back","but","be","perhap","still","in","shock","from","the","experi","if","you","want","a","good","crime","film","watch","the","usual","suspect","or","the","godfath","what","about","lock","stock","that","the","peak","of","the","contemporari","british","crime","film"],"filtered":["thi","film","quit","simpli","wrong","film","ever","make","damn","indict","onli","british","film","industri","talentless","hack","work","todai","onli","film","get","mainstream","distribut","conjur","featur","good","cast","british","actor","go","wrong","know","simpli","care","enough","engag","debat","becaus","film","terribl","deserv","think","warn","stai","hell","awai","thi","rubbish","appar","ne","write","ten","line","text","thi","review","mai","good","detail","plot","nob","man","setup","hi","evil","friend","cowork","hi","father","compani","thu","lead","encount","russian","mafia","dodgi","accent","stupid","veri","stupid","plot","twistsdevic","ask","monei","back","perhap","still","shock","experi","want","good","crime","film","watch","usual","suspect","godfath","lock","stock","peak","contemporari","british","crime","film"],"filtered2":["quit","simpli","wrong","ever","make","damn","indict","onli","british","industri","talentless","hack","work","todai","onli","get","mainstream","distribut","conjur","featur","good","cast","british","actor","go","wrong","know","simpli","care","enough","engag","debat","becaus","terribl","deserv","think","warn","stai","hell","awai","rubbish","appar","ne","write","ten","line","text","review","mai","good","detail","plot","nob","man","setup","evil","friend","cowork","father","compani","thu","lead","encount","russian","mafia","dodgi","accent","stupid","veri","stupid","plot","twistsdevic","ask","monei","back","perhap","still","shock","experi","want","good","crime","watch","usual","suspect","godfath","lock","stock","peak","contemporari","british","crime"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,6,7,11,12,15,22,25,26,32,37,39,41,44,45,46,48,63,64,65,92,93,107,110,120,126,136,155,157,161,166,176,201,205,265,305,306,308,318,321,333,343,366,394,423,508,527,545,559,696,740,753,789,882,889,943,977,1083,1098,1192,1232,1234,1288,1318,1902,1985,2161,2232,2470,2531,2656,2662,2774,3249,3802,4871,5208],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,6,7,11,12,15,22,25,26,32,37,39,41,44,45,46,48,63,64,65,92,93,107,110,120,126,136,155,157,161,166,176,201,205,265,305,306,308,318,321,333,343,366,394,423,508,527,545,559,696,740,753,789,882,889,943,977,1083,1098,1192,1232,1234,1288,1318,1902,1985,2161,2232,2470,2531,2656,2662,2774,3249,3802,4871,5208],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2979240167361772,2.559277576165403,1.3324924169710188,2.742262257014735,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.6955116224012472,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,1.9073850067444174,2.0489535369135887,2.035389827120098,2.1439533986393955,2.1290479736304078,2.2044500422972613,2.2391270689902285,4.693651971159972,2.3074766467914385,2.3360150694757706,2.4323182980210873,2.4423870329693536,2.5040471493269134,5.122871637503154,2.571852579609833,2.73529586597515,2.8612813773965557,2.8739486825973213,2.8753661172782943,2.902686292364678,3.09496984188738,2.948928684455311,3.112795625839981,3.008694896185175,3.0967381889441223,3.164467636384302,3.4149707055943286,3.439602492783994,3.442099372982581,3.5727776966246974,11.428639241709675,3.7165362186843414,7.7380870255

{"value":"I absolutely hate it when a film completely falls apart near the end, after you've already invested an hour into it. and that's what happened with this film. i was intrigued by its actors and the fact that malamud wrote its source story. I haven't gone to read that story but I cannot imagine that it ends like this film ends.Fortunately i didn't pay good money to see or rent it because my library had it. ohhhh such a waste of excellent acting (the wife in particular was so perfect).but milo o'shea as a Jew?!!!! now THAT was funny. I haven't researched into its making but it played like the director lost his marbles or died 3/4 of the way through the film. Before that point, a story and characters were developing,there were a number of neat plot points and there wasn't too much time wasted. but ooh that last 1/2 hour- if that wasn't the screwiest, most worthless denouement I've ever witnessed, I don't know what is. I just hate it when one's faith is so destroyed like that; it feels like an act of violence.","finished_norm":["i","absolut","hate","it","when","a","film","complet","fall","apart","near","the","end","after","you","have","alreadi","invest","a","hour","into","it","and","that","what","happen","with","thi","film","i","be","intrigu","by","it","actor","and","the","fact","that","malamud","write","it","sourc","stori","i","have","not","go","to","read","that","stori","but","i","cannot","imagin","that","it","end","like","thi","film","endsfortun","i","do","not","pai","good","monei","to","see","or","rend","it","becaus","my","librari","have","it","ohhhh","such","a","wast","of","excel","act","the","wife","in","particular","be","so","perfectbut","milo","o","shea","a","a","jew","now","that","be","funni","i","have","not","research","into","it","make","but","it","plai","like","the","director","lose","hi","marbl","or","die","of","the","wai","through","the","film","befor","that","point","a","stori","and","charact","be","developingther","be","a","numb","of","neat","plot","point","and","there","be","not","too","much","time","wast","but","ooh","that","last","hour","if","that","be","not","the","screwi","much","worthless","denouem","i","have","ever","wit","i","do","not","know","what","be","i","just","hate","it","when","on","faith","be","so","destroi","like","that","it","feel","like","a","act","of","violenc"],"filtered":["absolut","hate","film","complet","fall","apart","near","end","alreadi","invest","hour","happen","thi","film","intrigu","actor","fact","malamud","write","sourc","stori","go","read","stori","imagin","end","like","thi","film","endsfortun","pai","good","monei","see","rend","becaus","librari","ohhhh","wast","excel","act","wife","particular","perfectbut","milo","o","shea","jew","funni","research","make","plai","like","director","lose","hi","marbl","die","wai","film","befor","point","stori","charact","developingther","numb","neat","plot","point","much","time","wast","ooh","last","hour","screwi","much","worthless","denouem","ever","wit","know","hate","faith","destroi","like","feel","like","act","violenc"],"filtered2":["absolut","hate","complet","fall","apart","near","end","alreadi","invest","hour","happen","intrigu","actor","fact","malamud","write","sourc","stori","go","read","stori","imagin","end","like","endsfortun","pai","good","monei","see","rend","becaus","librari","ohhhh","wast","excel","act","wife","particular","perfectbut","milo","o","shea","jew","funni","research","make","plai","like","director","lose","marbl","die","wai","befor","point","stori","charact","developingther","numb","neat","plot","point","time","wast","ooh","last","hour","screwi","worthless","denouem","ever","wit","know","hate","faith","destroi","like","feel","like","act","violenc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,8,10,17,21,22,24,26,32,33,40,41,43,44,58,62,65,66,79,89,94,97,103,126,144,145,169,174,221,222,263,293,322,330,339,340,453,516,533,555,572,580,738,832,851,994,1017,1072,1179,1588,1890,2156,2727,2902,2944,3519,6675,7153,7503],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,8,10,17,21,22,24,26,32,33,40,41,43,44,58,62,65,66,79,89,94,97,103,126,144,145,169,174,221,222,263,293,322,330,339,340,453,516,533,555,572,580,738,832,851,994,1017,1072,1179,1588,1890,2156,2727,2902,2944,3519,6675,7153,7503],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.5841531782306313,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,3.83116108203179,2.324031090670098,1.2979240167361772,2.6420723132238515,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.865701314626681,2.0226120445069267,1.9073850067444174,3.859446346783224,1.9469506069506084,3.9880092219144876,2.08112281984698,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.2391270689902285,2.2931108769894046,2.34599021453259,2.4071371113909277,4.912565156919632,2.6423424573643777,2.5771019354959765,2.902686292364678,2.9012296278682137,2.885344817328191,2.9292757465539174,6.007688884102852,2.948928684455311,3.41740676039221,3.442099372982581,3.424750734647968,3.432149042129413,3.4933926673701317,3.5039747767006686,3.7398317812878634,3.7987743169213135,3.857614816944247,4.140259095366071,4.0536665665501035,4.268777946167049,4.390138803171316,4.654440426979034,4.85885294158718,4.9676558014359795,5.672363804397,5.390512652256013,5.463272006538442,6.868614562629026,6.543192162194399,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6384573438366724E-4,1.637005423951565E-4,1.637409613236308E-4,1.6370804415280209E-4,1.6372353717732116E-4,1.636996397997513E-4,1.6375055266042222E-4,1.6367528396326784E-4,1.6370057699159266E-4,1.6386974379925724E-4,1.6517000252032885E-4,1.6370084738261405E-4,

{"value":"Flat, soulless computer images on less than astonishing backgrounds animates a horribly predictable story in this film. Absolutely nothing takes you by surprise, you can even tell when the Bryan Adams vocals are going to come in, which are always at the wrong time.<br /><br />The main character, Spirit the horse, is given an annoying voice when he narrates what is happening. The narration is not needed, though, as everything happening is really obvious. You can even tell what the horses are saying, although all they do is neigh. Which would be good, but all the horses make exactly the same sounds - one for warning, one for sorrow, one for laughing, etc. There is no variation between the horses' voices.<br /><br />Young kids might like this film, though. It's soppy enough for a family to sit down and watch, and there's little danger of anyone being frightened.

{"value":"The excruciatingly slow pace of this film was probably the director's express intention, in order to convey what life was like growing up as a village teen in China. However, I found the combination of the glacially slow 'plot' and the general filming style so impersonal as to be totally alienating, particularly to a western audience. At times I actually had trouble telling some characters apart, as they were filmed from such a distance. Two hours in and I was totally past caring. As someone who is not only interested in music but is also very into the history and culture of China (and is by the way no stranger to Chinese cinema), I couldn't engage with a single character and found nothing to get my teeth into. It begs the question: If I disliked it, who on earth would like it? Give me Zhang Yimou, give me Chen Kaige. Give me the work of just about any other Chinese director I've ever seen. This sorry effort just doesn't measure up at all.

{"value":"A confused mess from start to finish. Like they used to say about the Beatles'songs, there was a secret message if you played the LP backward. If one had the patience to watch this films scenes from finish to start, you'd come away with the same degree of disappointment.<br /><br />Apart from all of this psychedelic hodge podge of flashbacks and false starts, the clearest characters were the movie backers, out for revenge if the movie didn't get sorted. There was nothing to like about these two either. Overacting, shouting and threats were delivered in comic book fashion. I think one dimensional was an overstatement.<br /><br />Okay, so maybe the artsy types are rolling their eyes reveling in the fact that unlike them, we plebeians just didn't get it. Well I'm afraid there was nothing to get. And the two cardinal sins of any bad movie carried from start to finish.

{"value":"I liked this show! I think it was nothing with wrong with it! Only that Spidey don't punch anyone but only for that the show doesn't suck! Some people only think this show is bad because of that. The story was great and it was fun when other heroes appeared like X-men, The Punisher, Daredevil and Iron Man! To bad Sandman never appear but i kinda like it! Best Spidey show ever!! My favorite episodes are: 1. Turning Point 2. Spider Wars 3. The Hobgoblin 4. The Alien Costume 5. Mutant Agenda<br /><br />But there are some episodes that was really really bad like: Rocket Racer and The Spot which was embarrassing to watch. And i don't like Morbius and Hydro Man. First of Morbius suck plasma instead of blood and i don't like vampires. And it irritates me that he was almost the main villain in Season 2. Of course i have to mentioned Hydro Man! He was terrible! I rather see Sandman! His last appearance was so terrible.

{"value":"Frank Sinatra plays a no-goodnik ex-soldier and frustrated writer, hard-living and hard-drinking, who returns to his Midwestern hometown and reunites with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), now the town big-shot with a disinterested wife and headstrong daughter. Frank gets involved with gambler Dean Martin, uneducated flooze Shirley MacLaine, and has some run-ins with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. Over-simplified drama verging on soap opera, with a role for MacLaine that is by turns overly 'colorful' and embarrassingly sentimental (her drunken belting on \"After You've Gone\" is however the film's highlight, and is expertly handled). Director Vincente Minnelli oversees it in straight-forward fashion, but he's in surprisingly glum spirits and most of the big scenes are flat or dense. The picture looks incredibly handsome in widescreen, with a nice eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs. ** from

{"value":"Three years ago, Rachel(Therese Fretwell) was partying at the lake with her friends when her brother falls out of a boat and drowns. Rachel's friends think it is time for her to stop beating herself up and taking blame for something she had no control over. So grab the brew and something to chew and head back to the same lake that has been in Rachel's constant nightmares. As expected, a bloodbath has already started when two of the friends are splattered before even heading to the party. This flick has the feel of a high school play where everyone forgot their lines and 'winged it'...very badly! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave himself the meatier role as Rachel's boyfriend Leo. Outside of Fretwell and Gabriel there are some pretty lame acting and a few characters you would like to choke the crap out of before they get 'offed'. Giving attention to a few more players that had the nerve to appear: Erin Gallagher, Andrew Williams, Jasmine Trice and Derek Nieves.

{"value":"I understand what this movie was trying to portray. How the old are often ignored and treated like a bother, which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are empty.<br /><br />I do not have a problem with this message, but I just feel that it could have been put across in a way that is not so painful to watch. I enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too self-consciously arty (as in this case) the result is often frustrating. Including shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly that take 5 minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audience.<br /><br />The female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull it together. This is a movie you feel you should enjoy or rate highly and certainly has its' merits but I was just too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else. It might have a deeper message than other Roger Michell movies (for example: 'Notting Hill') but at least that was a movie you could enjoy

{"value":"Considering that this movie had a serious and quite successful launching campaign, I would have expected something to be worth the fuzz...from the opening scene on (in which the two brothers \"sensually\" caress each other, laying naked in a bed) it goes rapidly downwards...nothing to get the attention, not a mind-catching thing in the whole plot, baaad baad acting (a few minor exceptions, but artificiality is at its best). Incest and lesbianism are promising themes, but the script analyses none of the two in depth ( mind that a possible excuse of the makers, saying that they aimed for a subtle movie would be hilarious, unless subtle and superficial mean the same thing...). The too curious viewers will not get any interesting scene...at this point, that could have saved some of the movie...so you can imagine how bad it is.

{"value":"this movie had more holes than a piece of swiss cheese. Ben Affleck was seriously NOT trying to act in any way, shape, or form. He outright sucked. Nothing about the movie was believable. The first problems were in the intro- where the man gives everything of value to the Salvation Army Santa Claus but it doesn't show why. And then the granny sticks her head in the oven- really beautiful, and has absolutely nothing to do with the movie- it's not even in the same tone as the movie. There was no explanation of the motivation for Ben Affleck to choose the house he chose; there was not any believable reactions by the family he chose; and people are swayed here and there without any cause to be swayed (Example: Christina Applegate and Ben Affleck's characters go tobogganing down a steep slope- this is the incident that makes her suddenly fall in love with him. Riiiight...) Anyway, there was a funny moment or two- but they were a rarity in the movie. It seriously needed another rewrite (or 4).

{"value":"Immediately after renting and watching this movie several years ago, a friend and I decided that it defined the absolute zero on the movie scale. There was nothing about the movie that could have been done worse than it was. To this day we still rate movies, even very bad ones, by how much better than \"The Lonely Lady\" they are.<br /><br />A long time ago I saw an interview with Eleanor Perry, who wrote the screenplays for, among other things, \"Last Summer\" and \"Diary of a Mad Housewife,\" and she related that she had been asked to write a screenplay for the Harold Robbins' book \"The Lonely Lady.\" She said that she sent in a treatment and it was rejected because they didn't think she understood the difficulties of a female screenwriter in Hollywood. She then said \"I think they got someone else to write it.\" The interview was filmed before the movie was released.

{"value":"This movie has not aged well. Maybe it's just the impact and artful characterization, acting, and directing that we've seen with The Sopranos, but I just viewed Prizzi's Honor for the first time, on DVD, alone.<br /><br />The experience of watching it with an audience 24 years ago must have been quite different, but I have to say, I was just appalled at the ending. Not just the violence of it, but the mere idea that somehow this would be a satisfying ending.<br /><br />I enjoy a good shocker, but this seemed so out of character... Also, when was this move supposed to be set? The cars all seemed like they were from the 1960s, and yet the World Trade Center towers {completed in 1973} were clearly visible in many cityscape scenes.<br /><br />Another way in which the film has aged poorly is the mere idea that a passenger could travel coast to coast with a knife on his person.<br /><br />Somehow, mid-1980s audiences found this film charming and funny.

{"value":"This movie is bizarre. Better put, it's \"freakin' weird\". I could give you a plot summary, or some hoity toity analysis, but I would consider it a waste of your time. All anybody needs to know about this movie is two young sisters, one incestuous relationship, homicide, post mortem mutilation, and one really disturbing infatuation. At the end of the movie you feel like you need to go take a shower to wash the filth off yourself, but not in a good way like after \"Pulp Fiction\" or \"Fight Club\". It's like you're a teenager (or high schooler being that i am myself still a teenager)and have just done something you A: wish you hadn't done, and B: hope to the Good Lord of Heaven and Earth that your parents never find out about. And nobody likes that. My advise is that rather than defiling your mind and by watching piece of wanton cinematic filth, just go waste your time on something a little less horrible and watch \"Kazaam\"(yes, I would rather

{"value":"Brainless film about a good looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. The pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence. Great looking direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasn't so interested in primarily looking good. Performances are serviceable and the plot is actually not bad, or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits (or in what I'm guessing the reason for the \"unrated\" moniker a few fleeting bare breasts). The film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable TV movie.

{"value":"Not even Goebbels could have pulled off a propaganda stunt like what Gore has done with this complete piece of fiction. This is a study in how numbers and statistics can be spun to say whatever you have predetermined them to say. The \"scientists\" Gore says have signed onto the validity of global warming include social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists. Would you say a meteorologist is an expert in neuro-surgery? The field research and data analysis geologists are involved in do not support Gores alarmist claims of global warming. As one of those geologists working in the field for the last 40 years I have not seen any evidence to support global warming. My analysis of this movie and Gores actions over the last couple years brings me to the conclusion that global warming is his way of staying important and relevant. No more, no less. Ask any global warming alarmist or \"journalist\" one simple question- You say global warming is a major problem. Tell me.

{"value":"This film was a critical and box-office fiasco back in 1957. It was based on a novel which was later turned into a play--which flopped on Broadway. The story is about some navy officers on leave in San Francisco during WWII. They have 4 day's leave which they spend at the Mark Hopkins hotel. The film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real. Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and drama--but here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he doesn't really pull it off. Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices. Audrey Hepburn was initially set to play opposite Grant, but had other commitments--so Suzy parker stepped in. She had never acted before, but was America's top photographic model at the time. I think that she did a good job, considering all the pressure that she was under. Grant's pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a few brief scenes--did not really work.

{"value":"Drones, ethnic drumming, bad synthesizer piping, children singing. The most patronizing \"world music\" imaginable. This is a tourist film, and a lousy one. What really kills it is the incoherent sequences. India, Egypt, South America, Africa, etc, etc. No transitions, no visual explanation of why we're suddenly ten thousand miles away, no ideas expressed in images. Just a bunch of footage of third-worlders with \"baskets on their heads\" as another reviewer said. Walking along endlessly as if that had some deep meaning. If these guys wanted to make a 3rd World music video, all they had to do was head a few hundred miles south of where the best parts of Koya were shot, and film in Mexico. That would have been a much better setting for \"life in transformation.\"<br /><br />But no. What they decided on was a scrambled tourist itinerary covering half the globe and mind-deadeningly overcranked filter shots. The only thing to recommend this film is that it doesn't suck quite as much as Naqoyqatsi.<br /><br

{"value":"The first 45 minutes of Dragon Fighter are entirely acceptable and surprisingly watchable. The characters are believable and interesting. The cloning lab looks really high-tech. After that, it all collapses. The characters start behaving idiotically, and a new subplot is introduced from nowhere about a fusion reactor (and this is supposedly \"present day\") going critical, the only plot justification of which is that it is required to kill the dragon - only it doesn't. The finish is incredibly weak. One wonders what made a movie that started out so well turn so wrong.<br /><br />All the characters except Dean Cain are played by Russians. This results in some weird situations and details, like the character being played by Vessela Dimitrova being called \"Bailey Kent\" despite her heavy accent (and despite her, on one occasion,

{"value":"1st watched 11/07/2004 - 1 out of 10(Dir-Jon Keeyes): Over-the-top rehash of 70's supposed horror flicks like Friday the 13th(versions 1 thru whatever). I can't think of much redeeming here except(or can I think of anything?)The story revolves around a bunch of stupid people listening to a radio program one year after some kids were slayed in the woods as an 'homage' to this, supposedly. But, lo and behold, one of the stupid people, have connections to the actual event because her sister was one of the ones murdered(again, how stupid is this that she would even be a part of this). Guess what? The murderer is at it again and we're tipped off from the very beginning who it is(so there goes any mystery whatsoever). And besides all this, where are the 'cops' and why doesn't someone call them. I can't believe this movie was financed by someone and made.

{"value":"It's \"The F.B.I.\" starring Reed Hadley, with an all-star guest cast! The film begins with an accidental (convenient?) kidnapping, which leads to one thing, and another - which doesn't really indicate the main story, which is a \"Big House, U.S.A.\" prison break story. The story is very improbable, to say the least. It's like a TV show, only more \"violent\" (for the times).<br /><br />BUT - the cast is a trip! Picture this: Ralph Meeker is sent to prison; his cell-mates are the following criminals: Broderick Crawford, Lon Chaney Jr., Charles Bronson (reading a \"Muscle\" magazine!), and William Talman (reading a \"Detective\" magazine!). Honest! You should know that, an early scene reveals what happens to the \"missing\" boy, answering the ending \"voiceover.\" If you don't want to have that hanging, don't miss the opening scenes between the \"Iceman\" and the boy (Peter Votrian doing well as a runaway asthmatic). <br /><br />*** Big House, U.S.A.

{"value":"\"Fly Me To The Moon\" has to be the worst animated film I've seen in a LONG TIME. That's saying something since I have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now. The story is to be generous...trite. The voice acting is atrocious, Too cute sounding. The humor is of the Romper Room variety. The animation is passable for a Nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television.<br /><br />It gets a 2 only because of it's OK 3-D visuals. Some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but We've seen much better in the past. I also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes. While that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time. It seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators.<br /><br />I will say this though, It had a pretty cool soundtrack. And for the record my son wasn't too crazy about it either.

{"value":"What do you get when you have bad acting, bad directing, scenes that are excruciatingly long, terrible lighting, painful editing, and awful effects? You get Jessica: A Ghost Story Seems its shot on betacam, which is fine, but the lighting has to compliment this medium. In this case it does not. There are a few CU's where the person's face is entirely in shadow. One scene in particular is the scene at the psychiatrists. It's a joke if you ask me. Some of the scenes were so long that they could have easily been cut in half... but I guess then they wouldn't have a film at feature length. The main character is incredibly flat. He's the LEAD male, so he should have some \"hero\" elements to his character, but he does not. He whines and is scared the entire film. I could go on, but I don't want to waste my time. Although the lighting was terrible, I must say that they did have nice camera movement. Too bad the lighting didn't compliment it. The cover of the DVD is nice, and that's where it ends.

{"value":"I basically skimmed through the movie but just enough to catch watch the plot was about. To tell you the truth it was kind of boring to me and at some spots it didn't make sense. The only reason I watched this movie in the first place was to see CHACE CRAWFORD!!! He is so hot, but in this movie his hair was kind of weird. But still hot.<br /><br />However, despite how hot CHACE is, it really did not make up for the film. I guess the plot isn't that bad but what really threw me over was the fact that they cuss in like every sentence. Is it that hard to express your anger without saying the F word every time?The cussing was annoying and the whole flashy, camera shaking thing gave me a headache.<br /><br />All in all, although the plot was OK, I found the film to be a bore and over dramatic. That's why I only cut to scenes with CHACE in it. LOL Anyways, not worth renting unless your a die-hard fan of a specific cast member like I was. Oh yeah the cast was Hot. The girls were HOT!!!

{"value":"Back in 1985 I caught this thing (I can't even call it a movie) on cable. I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control. I figured out early on that this was hopeless. Stupid script (a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. The plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while--but even he was bored after 30 minutes in. Remember--this was a HIGH SCHOOL BOY! This was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the Internet and such. We kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened. The funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap! (One poster had a fictional review that said, \"This is the best movie I've seen this afternoon!\"). Only Grant Cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business. No-budget and boring t&a.

{"value":"Snow White is in my opinion a bad movie on an artistic point of view. The plot is pretty much foreseeable, the characters are stereotypes, the editing too exaggerated. Anyway, the movie seems not to have a lot of artistic ambitions. <br /><br />Instead, I think this is a straight commercial thing. Including a character from the french part of Switzerland (the actor IS the leader of the band he is touring with in the movie - the band's called SENS UNIK) seems to aim to a larger audience. A straight German-swiss movie would not have sold in the french part - and vice versa. What really got on my nerves were the product placements all over the movie. Sometines scenes remembered of advertisement clips! <br /><br />I also think the topic of \"young people taking drugs without any other targets in their lives\" is a wide spread reality in Zurich. Therefore, it should be elaborated with more care.

{"value":"I can't believe how awful this movie turned out to be. I feel magnanimous even referring to it as a \"movie\". The acting was flat, the editing was terrible and the plot leaves many major questions unanswered. The premise was OK, if unoriginal: a small group of aliens is living in the US and trying to slowly take over humanity. But it goes rapidly downhill from there. How could they convince a \"human\" to accept an alien as his wife in order to make they alien-human hybrid they require? They show a larval alien but never show what it does. They have a plastic surgeon that can produce perfect looking skin on an industrial scale. They throw in the obligatory huge alien monster with teeth. The ending was almost too painful to watch. I suppose that I'm mostly disappointed that Bruce Boxlietner would have anything to do with this. How could he say to the huge alien monster with teeth, \"Get away from him you son of a b*tch\" with a straight face? It's a long fall from his Babylon 5 days.

{"value":"\"Rival reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories. The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />This said-to-be follow-up to \"The Thirteenth Guest\" has little to do with the earlier movie; it is not a sequel, as has been inferred. Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills. Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. They are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; but, the resulting film is very dull. The opening and closing are startling.

{"value":"To confess having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make. But what can I tell you? Maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star. It crosses that barrier. It pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory. Brando had it in spades, Montgomery Clift, Gary Cooper, James Dean of course and in more recent times, Tom Cruise, Jude Law, Johnny Depp, Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup. Women fell in love with Garbo, Dietrich, Katharine and Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Marilyn Monroe, Julie Christie, Charlotte Rampling, Meryl Streep, Vanessa Redgrave, Julia Roberts and very very recently Natalie Portman. But Brad Pitt has, singlehandedly, redefined the concept. He is the only reason to go out, get in the car, find parking, buy a ticket, popcorn and get into a theatre to see \"Troy\" If you liked epics in the \"Jupiter's Darling\" style you may enjoy this.

{"value":"Imagine, its, say 12-1am - your at home, your bored, your not tired. This scenario occurred about, say 4 or so years back..I turned on the TV and flicked over a few channels and found that this film was on. OH MY WORD this is the worst film I have ever seen! A runaway car that cant be stopped (cos the brakes have been cut or something) in caning it down the freeway - whats gonna happen?! This film was so bad its actually funny - I think the stunts cost about $2 to make, there was one instance where a baby/small child is being winched from the car by a helicopter - in an attempt to excite the viewer - a conveniently placed bridge is nearing ahead...THIS IS THE BEST BAD BIT OF A FILM EVER - it shows the child narrowly missing the bridge but it looks so bad - you can almost see the make of the dummy that they used - total low budget classic! Cant remember the end of the film, though but I bet it was GREAT<br /><br />I doubt they will ever show this film again so I'm glad I got to see this piece of trash!","finished_norm":["imagin","it","sai","be","your","at","home","your","bore","your","not","tire","thi","scenario","occur","about","sai","or","so","year","backi","turn","on","the","tv","and","flick","over","a","few","channel","and","find","that","thi","film","be","on","oh","my","word","thi","be","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","a","runawai","car","that","cant","be","stop","co","the","brake","have","be","cut","or","someth","in","cane","it","down","the","freewai","what","gonna","happen","thi","film","be","so","bad","it","actual","funni","i","think","the","stunt","cost","about","to","make","there","be","on","instanc","where","a","babysmal","child","be","be","winch","from","the","car","by","a","helicopt","in","a","attempt","to","excit","the","viewer","a","conveni","place","bridg","be","near","aheadthi","be","the","well","bad","bite","of","a","film","ever","it","show","the","child","narrowli","miss","the","bridg","but","it","look","so","bad","you","can","almost","see","the","make","of","the","dummi","that","thei","us","total","low","budget","classic","cant","rememb","the","end","of","the","film","though","but","i","bet","it","be","greatbr","br","i","doubt","thei","will","ever","show","thi","film","again","so","i","be","glad","i","get","to","see","thi","piec","of","trash"],"filtered":["imagin","sai","home","bore","tire","thi","scenario","occur","sai","year","backi","turn","tv","flick","channel","find","thi","film","oh","word","thi","wrong","film","ever","see","runawai","car","cant","stop","co","brake","cut","someth","cane","freewai","gonna","happen","thi","film","bad","actual","funni","think","stunt","cost","make","instanc","babysmal","child","winch","car","helicopt","attempt","excit","viewer","conveni","place","bridg","near","aheadthi","well","bad","bite","film","ever","show","child","narrowli","miss","bridg","look","bad","almost","see","make","dummi","thei","us","total","low","budget","classic","cant","rememb","end","film","though","bet","greatbr","br","doubt","thei","ever","show","thi","film","glad","get","see","thi","piec","trash"],"filtered2":["imagin","home","bore","tire","scenario","occur","year","backi","turn","tv","flick","channel","find","oh","word","wrong","ever","see","runawai","car","cant","stop","co","brake","cut","someth","cane","freewai","gonna","happen","bad","actual","funni","think","stunt","cost","make","instanc","babysmal","child","winch","car","helicopt","attempt","excit","viewer","conveni","place","bridg","near","aheadthi","well","bad","bite","ever","show","child","narrowli","miss","bridg","look","bad","almost","see","make","dummi","us","total","low","budget","classic","cant","rememb","end","though","bet","greatbr","doubt","ever","show","glad","get","see","piec","trash"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,9,12,16,20,24,25,28,38,44,52,53,56,57,62,86,94,96,108,131,154,164,172,177,180,184,217,218,234,255,256,257,258,279,284,290,302,303,315,332,340,524,555,567,671,728,836,900,1216,1227,1259,1351,1451,1455,1544,1569,2151,2193,2372,2508,5312,6272,6692,7637],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,9,12,16,20,24,25,28,38,44,52,53,56,57,62,86,94,96,108,131,154,164,172,177,180,184,217,218,234,255,256,257,258,279,284,290,302,303,315,332,340,524,555,567,671,728,836,900,1216,1227,1259,1351,1451,1455,1544,1569,2151,2193,2372,2508,5312,6272,6692,7637],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.967100616408184,0.7966340470719924,3.205071257016622,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,3.0904588387038183,1.519311641348122,4.814188177507422,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,2.0226120445069267,2.031112399272319,2.08112281984698,2.0390708128715254,2.138507503627933,2.2512118082053005,2.348499626138016,2.3930275298746078,2.5001408943598484,2.458149992634611,5.419462958538709,2.496249838866882,2.6113665294700725,2.5940874818617203,2.673149229007135,2.6754694156628323,2.748952192422636,2.7602659523229094,2.7061321952397077,2.7910771187233068,6.221997360326558,2.8612813773965557,2.902686292364678,2.868298950055202,2.854312708080462,2.9705344631698933,2.948928684455311,3.4028786598293,3.432149042129413,3.454678155189441,3.6466665387238555,3.7740817043309423,3.7881170224473255,3.9201351739255808,4.280272325592784,4.246178114249808,4.315570107673808,4.436351646326448,4.499089986959872,9.275546748987644,4.6973654716960676,4.597282013139085,10.286208957884345,5.00274712124725,5.290429193699031,5.1994574154933035,6.2980697041614135,6.437831646536572,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.55548317223404E-4,1.5541047799571753E-4,1.5544885004325237E-4,1.5541759985203182E-4,1.55432308284

{"value":"1st watched 2/16/2002 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Arne Glimcher): Mystery??/Thriller with too many ridiculous plot twists. Despite the very talented cast this movie is way too predictable and just downright under-estimates it's audience. The movie-going public is not stupid and I hope will not keep filling certain stars pockets again and again despite what they are involved with. We think that this movie is going to be about something with Connery's conviction against capitol punishment in the beginning but it turns out to be nothing but a standard, contrived for the audience's sake, run of the mill, let's never get it over with, thriller. We are pulled into every silly switch in character, as they are portrayed to us when it's needed in the story, and we're ready for this thing to be over way before it ends. Yes there is some good acting here, especially from Blair Underwood, Fishburne, and Ed Harris in a psycho-supporting role but the story does not work from almost the beginning to the very long-awaited
