{"value":"The Good Earth follows the life a slave girl and a poor farmer in China. The movie is based on the novel by Pearl S. Buck. The story is great, but I hated that they decided to cast Anglos in the lead roles. Walter Connolly is laughable as the farmer's father. He has such a heavy American accent, as do most of the lead actors, that I could not bear listening to him speak.<br /><br />It is a shame that Hollywood could not get past their racist beliefs to cast Asians in the lead roles. To take Anglos and make them look like Chinese is akin to Anglos putting shoe polish on their faces to play African-Americans.","finished_norm":["the","good","earth","follow","the","life","a","slave","girl","and","a","poor","farmer","in","china","the","movi","be","base","on","the","novel","by","pearl","buck","the","stori","be","great","but","i","hate","that","thei","decid","to","cast","anglo","in","the","lead","role","walter","connolli","be","laughabl","a","the","farmer","father","he","have","such","a","heavi","american","accent","a","do","much","of","the","lead","actor","that","i","can","not","bear","listen","to","him","speakbr","br","it","be","a","shame","that","hollywood","can","not","get","past","their","racist","belief","to","cast","asian","in","the","lead","role","to","take","anglo","and","make","them","look","like","chines","be","akin","to","anglo","putt","shoe","polish","on","their","face","to","plai","africanamerican"],"filtered":["good","earth","follow","life","slave","girl","poor","farmer","china","movi","base","novel","pearl","buck","stori","great","hate","thei","decid","cast","anglo","lead","role","walter","connolli","laughabl","farmer","father","heavi","american","accent","much","lead","actor","bear","listen","speakbr","br","shame","hollywood","get","past","racist","belief","cast","asian","lead","role","take","anglo","make","look","like","chines","akin","anglo","putt","shoe","polish","face","plai","africanamerican"],"filtered2":["good","earth","follow","life","slave","girl","poor","farmer","china","base","novel","pearl","buck","stori","great","hate","decid","cast","anglo","lead","role","walter","connolli","laughabl","farmer","father","heavi","american","accent","lead","actor","bear","listen","speakbr","shame","hollywood","get","past","racist","belief","cast","asian","lead","role","take","anglo","make","look","like","chines","akin","anglo","putt","shoe","polish","face","plai","africanamerican"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,16,17,31,40,41,51,75,84,92,128,146,157,223,249,251,260,300,334,339,342,440,474,522,525,552,559,574,845,1177,1213,1407,1421,1512,1671,1878,2385,2646,2675,2880,3110,3254,3472,3851,4861],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,16,17,31,40,41,51,75,84,92,128,146,157,223,249,251,260,300,334,339,342,440,474,522,525,552,559,574,845,1177,1213,1407,1421,1512,1671,1878,2385,2646,2675,2880,3110,3254,3472,3851,4861],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.4070669811451506,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.7139899308309823,1.9742250248702675,2.2212694515902225,4.0979070738271774,4.681980408231769,2.326138445979858,7.008045208427312,2.825563294794476,2.6754694156628323,2.6942272927333892,2.6754694156628323,2.932274249550174,2.942840385588056,3.003844442051426,3.112795625839981,3.212973749990824,3.6466665387238555,3.604618302480356,3.4149707055943286,3.424750734647968,3.5727776966246974,3.5039747767006686,3.831445099210862,4.263079925052412,4.251780369798478,4.443131333311827,4.733083554298147,4.535724120139652,5.129498826886393,4.9676558014359795,5.408212229355414,5.339219357868463,5.521540914662417,5.501738287366237,5.463272006538442,5.999576715605417,11.935656034581672,5.7446844659766265,6.101359409915359]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.052593568791786E-5,7.00503628159564E-5,7.059493759038688E-5,7.018703928891657E-5,7.018818922453353E-5,7.009008016227787E-5,7.029853788120954E-5,0.041516252612625065,7.021797104126657E-5,7.790300582227566E-5,0.5185565493411236,6.994735659818489E-5,7.125288932240053E-5,7.22693274454115E-5,6.999836148093247E-5,6.98049162112484E-5,7.154611252735241E-5,7.030512432357338E-5,7.008700294923696E-5,7.014509261342493E-5,7.082378752538381E-5,7.037477891124104E-5,7.045491127333781E-5,7.053081853807444E-5,0.0882053855237871,7.070041922756032E-5,7.367253054083156E-5,6.996815130595674E-5,6.997002311786103E-5,7.014729177574855E-5,7.163825604078334E-5,7.030105074197277E-5,0.07330702134014438,7.049879722362354E-5,7.004430849210288E-5,7.03676091494775E-5,6.997412234459933E-5,7.001547190258081E-5,6.98045655057054E-5,6.982267603048713E-5,6.997983838847231E-5,7.07179774004754E-5,7.035862963937243E-5,7.008045128576126E-5,7.09320022527241E-5,7.010734854591758E-5,7.243666759858685E-5,7.137146528747223E-5,6.984003078254292E-5,6.999438152158335E-5,6.997010483302138E-5,0.14605879804846447,6.999542290454203E-5,6.981647737238036E-5,7.058281312661897E-5,7.001345186735287E-5,7.529177280594839E-5,6.995575168564364E-5,6.983922312265287E-5,0.035010978518007316,7.086873897370737E-5,7.016804259299595E-5,6.982630271024091E-5,6.998888256169318E-5,6.980540980428174E-5,7.142056230208532E-5,7.040675064164837E-5,7.025677395432622E-5,7.019533123021474E-5,7.045120437073016E-5,6.980286319222425E-5,7.019680284245132E-5,0.09219358215281696,6.992795380032848E-5,7.1658634

{"value":"Perhaps I'm not a sophisticate. This and Closer are two of the more supposedly cerebral films I've seen recently, and both suffer from exactly the same problem to an excruciating extent. The dialogue is false false false. Nothing that comes out of anyone's mouth seems remotely believable. Perhaps the way this film is set up that's the way it's supposed to feel, but it was unwatchable. And boring. I walked out after 20 minutes of tedium.<br /><br />I'll stick with Sleeper and Bananas for my Woody Allen fix.

Other than that, there's nothing worthwhile about the film.","finished_norm":["a","famili","travel","for","their","daughter","softbal","leagu","decid","to","take","the","scenic","rout","and","end","up","in","the","middl","of","nowher","the","father","be","a","avid","photograph","and","when","he","hear","of","a","old","abandon","side","show","in","the","town","he","decid","to","take","anoth","detour","to","take","some","photographsbr","br","of","cours","the","side","show","be","fill","with","inbr","freak","who","promptli","kidnap","the","woman","and","leav","the","young","son","and","father","to","fend","for","themselvesbr","br","the","onli","cool","thing","about","thi","film","be","how","the","famili","actual","fight","back","against","their","inbr","captor","other","than","that","there","noth","worthwhil","about","the","film"],"filtered":["famili","travel","daughter","softbal","leagu","decid","take","scenic","rout","end","middl","nowher","father","avid","photograph","hear","old","abandon","side","show","town","decid","take","anoth","detour","take","photographsbr","br","cours","side","show","fill","inbr","freak","promptli","kidnap","woman","leav","young","son","father","fend","themselvesbr","br","onli","cool","thing","thi","film","famili","actual","fight","back","inbr","captor","noth","worthwhil","film"],"filtered2":["famili","travel","daughter","softbal","leagu","decid","take","scenic","rout","end","middl","nowher","father","avid","photograph","hear","old","abandon","side","show","town","decid","take","anoth","detour","take","photographsbr","cours","side","show","fill","inbr","freak","promptli","kidnap","woman","leav","young","son","father","fend","themselvesbr","onli","cool","thing","famili","actual","fight","back","inbr","captor","noth","worthwhil"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[11,24,28,29,31,49,52,63,67,70,73,74,135,182,199,216,232,249,342,425,426,434,450,481,553,554,799,1032,1313,1314,1370,1487,2016,2535,2549,3401,4127,4930,7075,7616,8609],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[11,24,28,29,31,49,52,63,67,70,73,74,135,182,199,216,232,249,342,425,426,434,450,481,553,554,799,1032,1313,1314,1370,1487,2016,2535,2549,3401,4127,4930,7075,7616,8609],"values":[0.9913098153388195,1.3210361566119257,3.0904588387038183,1.3195384777338066,4.221200943435452,1.6920303308087352,1.7122153074726136,1.8729627573220065,1.9570915389266579,2.094675786251684,1.8950689206770979,1.9486336368009016,2.366244071437088,5.473059344848157,2.558331832813986,2.6070186965339692,2.8377834061292515,5.3509388313256645,6.225591251679962,6.453975986731272,3.3909310864081816,3.4101163271295305,3.469984576472117,3.353630724994973,3.454678155189441,3.439602492783994,3.7636829971100436,4.140259095366071,4.4919214974812585,4.409683399244287,4.520909034354511,4.558366596889411,4.900964426937307,10.549361673461783,5.408212229355414,5.5623629091826725,5.878215858601149,6.101359409915359,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.523634482063163E-5,7.472900855868452E-5,7.530995534244605E-5,7.487481361817358E-5,7.487604035769508E-5,7.477137861636692E-5,7.499375917281166E-5,7.4739769047623E-5,7.49078112943194E-5,8.310612757474558E-5,0.4731824692574491,7.461912258208123E-5,7.601185150167122E-5,7.709617726588494E-5,7.467353406784887E-5,7.446716863828162E-5,7.63246590091787E-5,7.500078552196951E-5,7.476809587705726E-5,7.483006533499825E-5,7.55540901058301E-5,7.507509232165937E-5,7.516057670364167E-5,0.11119976074217365,7.581899406535888E-5,7.54224820710774E-5,7.85930999356892E-5,7.464130616304486E-5,7.464330299278551E-5,7.483241137880868E-5,7.642295676420815E-5,7.499643986689994E-5,0.15700938461479264,7.520739378527656E-5,7.472254986809564E-5,7.506744369334893E-5,7.464767600582495E-5,7.469178729016495E-5,7.446679450920546E-5,7.448611463128637E-5,7.465377382280025E-5,7.544121294985232E-5,7.505786444406998E-5,7.476110662966057E-5,7.566953246701863E-5,7.47898003509152E-5,0.14911680875370417,0.044615981331693665,7.450462850277506E-5,7.466928828803693E-5,7.464339016568045E-5,7.674413575259623E-5,7.467039922469599E-5,7.447950196639654E-5,7.529702108885678E-5,7.468963233730291E-5,8.032049097585289E-5,7.462807837527539E-5,7.450376689948837E-5,7.485950051957827E-5,0.05930609440732359,7.4854548137811E-5,7.448998353604953E-5,7.46634220540279E-5,7.446769519826688E-5,7.619072331660878E-5,7.510919943572991E-5,7.494920584397726E-5,7.488365937610159E-5,7.515662221796081E-5,7.446497849864409E-5,7.488522927694152E-5,7.609981798365812E-5,7.459842387633886E-5,7.644469599903388E-5,7.479565453025608E-5,7.538104282748425E-5,7.492034705497629E-5,7.444163153471855E-5,7.453390704970042E-5]}}

And if it wasn't bad enough, they had to sink it even further with that awful reggae music. Not exactly mood-setting music for a horror movie, eh mon?

{"value":"Spoilers I guess.<br /><br /> The absolutely absurd logic of the ending ruins the entire movie. I just couldn't get over it. And what is wrong with Mark Wahlberg's character? If I suddenly found myself crashed-landed on a planet full of talking apes, I'd be all like, \" AAAAhhhhHHH!!! Run for your lives! The monkeys have inherited the Earth!\" But he's all like, \"talking apes, okay. Next?\" That's pretty jaded I'd say. He must run into even stranger things on a regular basis. Besides that, this is Rick Baker's best work yet. This film is a true testament to how far we've come in the monkey makeup field.

{"value":"Well, I do like the gore in this movie - it is genuingly unsetteling. Anyone that's been to the dentist will know why. The story really isn't that bad, Corbin Bersen's character's motivations do make a lot more sense than in most horror movies.<br /><br />I've seen worse acting, directing, script, etc. but at the end of the day this is still a bad horror movie. So it comes down to if you enjoy that type of thing or not. I tried to watch the sequel, but it was exactly, exactly the same thing as this movie. Just keep in mind if you enjoy people getting tortured at the dentist, then this is the movie for you!","finished_norm":["good","i","do","like","the","gore","in","thi","movi","it","be","genuingli","unsettel","anyon","that","be","to","the","dentist","will","know","why","the","stori","realli","be","not","that","bad","corbin","bersen","charact","motiv","do","make","a","lot","much","sens","than","in","much","horror","moviesbr","br","i","have","see","wrong","act","direct","script","etc","but","at","the","end","of","the","dai","thi","be","still","a","bad","horror","movi","so","it","come","down","to","if","you","enjoi","that","typ","of","thing","or","not","i","try","to","watch","the","sequel","but","it","be","exactli","exactli","the","same","thing","a","thi","movi","just","keep","in","mind","if","you","enjoi","peopl","get","tortur","at","the","dentist","then","thi","be","the","movi","for","you"],"filtered":["good","like","gore","thi","movi","genuingli","unsettel","anyon","dentist","know","stori","realli","bad","corbin","bersen","charact","motiv","make","lot","much","sens","much","horror","moviesbr","br","see","wrong","act","direct","script","etc","end","dai","thi","still","bad","horror","movi","come","enjoi","typ","thing","try","watch","sequel","exactli","exactli","thing","thi","movi","keep","mind","enjoi","peopl","get","tortur","dentist","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["good","like","gore","genuingli","unsettel","anyon","dentist","know","stori","realli","bad","corbin","bersen","charact","motiv","make","lot","sens","horror","moviesbr","see","wrong","act","direct","script","etc","end","dai","still","bad","horror","come","enjoi","typ","thing","try","watch","sequel","exactli","exactli","thing","keep","mind","enjoi","peopl","get","tortur","dentist"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,10,13,17,21,23,24,25,26,29,34,36,64,72,77,83,102,132,134,158,173,200,238,358,384,387,429,462,802,902,2531,3641],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,10,13,17,21,23,24,25,26,29,34,36,64,72,77,83,102,132,134,158,173,200,238,358,384,387,429,462,802,902,2531,3641],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,2.6390769554676132,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.883428577602134,1.9209463754160525,1.9463902258768238,4.584637595480144,2.087553710177271,2.253494045787767,2.2443961816702407,2.3106972614914807,2.4368824319140248,5.061642365863941,2.597304642813496,3.2030824725120812,3.109204957709252,3.360519385990158,3.2872346624216657,6.5279063751982145,3.8883864756110005,3.9201351739255808,5.156897801074508,12.064733076856815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.2764048766355642E-4,1.2677977801533097E-4,1.277653698986512E-4,1.2702714023024673E-4,1.2702922142692282E-4,1.2685165996065682E-4,1.272289345709422E-4,1.2679803347496132E-4,1.2708312167757858E-4,1.4099178630699999E-4,0.8435875232567457,1.2659335349305429E-4,1.2895615565872856E-4,1.3079574355551383E-4,1.2668566404581226E-4,1.2633555953010694E-4,1.2948684202976726E-4,1.272408549617472E-4,1.268460907049021E-4,1.2695122356124556E-4,1.2817955110759028E-4,1.2736691845103215E-4,1.275119450100689E-4,1.276493248291905E-4,1.286289678178102E-4,1.2795627452794883E-4,1.3333531322791043E-4,1.266309885363179E-4,1.2663437621181553E-4,1.2695520368782875E-4,1.296536068216787E-4,1.2723348244074532E-4,1.3657436523286995E-4,1.2759137145143987E-4,1.2676882067259458E-4,1.2735394234686558E-4,1.2664179514635098E-4,1.2671663112965198E-4,1.263349248100412E-4,1.2636770191809993E-4,1.2665214025727134E-4,1.2798805196885052E-4,1.2733769089216866E-4,1.268342332582353E-4,1.283754021861384E-4,1.2688291293004225E-4,1.3109860205074193E-4,1.2917075889453536E-4,1.2639911120028912E-4,1.2667846096587793E-4,1.2663452410298232E-4,1.301984956357602E-4,1.2668034569987536E-4,1.263564833538102E-4,1.2774342658867735E-4,1.267129751940153E-4,1.3626587870497876E-4,1.266085472376925E-4,1.2639764946708096E-4,1.2700116114557688E-4,1.2826090592733477E-4,0.14643790710466173,1.263742656193519E-4,1.2666850874170428E-4,1.2633645285332011E-4,1.2925961651587582E-4,1.274247820897182E-4,1.2715334864723719E-4,1.2704214729708892E-4,1.2750523611848244E-4,1.2633184389915686E-4,1.2704481067619472E-4,1.2910539316735056E-4,1.2655823758064177E-4,1.2969048801973802E-4,1.2689284470314636E-4,1.2788597173382389E-4,1.2710438893354768E-4,1.262922351453289E-4,1.2644878304461573E-4]}}
{"value":"I have just watched the movie for the first time. I wanted to watch it as I like Drew Barrymore and wanted to see one of her early movies. <br /><br />The movie is about a girl (played by young and beautiful Drew Barrymore), who moves from NYC to LA in order to get over her recently troubled loss. Short after moving to a guy who falls in love with her, it becomes obvious that she has an evil twin=doppelganger, who haunts her.<br /><br />The movie is quite poor and lousy. Both the dialogs and the acting make the film not really worth seeing it.

But no, foolishly, I went in and watched the movie. This movie didn't make ANYONE in the theater laugh. Not even once. Not even inadvertantly! Mostly, we sat there in stunned silence.

{"value":"Twin brothers separated at birth (Due to the deaths of their parents) reunite twenty five years later to avenge their parents and take back their million dollar tunnel. Double Impact runs at two hours long and basically adds no real approach to the Corsican Brothers plot and Jean-Claude Van Damme while adequate as the evil twin brother is just embarrassing as the good twin brother.

{"value":"THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S MOVIE!!!<br /><br />This movie is like a \"bad acid trip\" for kids under the age of 5. For a month my 4 year old from time-to-time would ask me \"Why was that rabbit bleeding from its mouth\" or \"Why did the bulldozer bury all the rabbits?\". (And that wasn't the worst of it). We stopped it about a 1/2 hour in but the damage had been done. Intensely morbid, oppressive, violent. Fortunately he's finally forgotten about the whole wretched thing. Whomever decided this movie should be marketed to children should be brought up on charges. ...

{"value":"I sincerely consider this movie as another poor effort of Dominican Movie Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are a little funny but then when they switch their role in the society (men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do) the movie falls. Becoming boring and not funny at all. They let many things without explanation and the end of the movie is predictable. I didn't like the way as a Roberto Angel played his character and his little either. I went to the movies theater hoping to see a good work but I went out really disappointed.<br /><br />I don't recommend this movie.","finished_norm":["i","sincer","consid","thi","movi","a","anoth","poor","effort","of","dominican","movi","industri","the","minut","of","the","movi","be","a","littl","funni","but","then","when","thei","switch","their","role","in","the","societi","man","do","what","woman","usual","do","and","woman","do","what","man","usual","do","the","movi","fall","becom","bore","and","not","funni","at","all","thei","let","mani","thing","without","explan","and","the","end","of","the","movi","be","predict","i","do","not","like","the","wai","a","a","roberto","angel","plai","hi","charact","and","hi","littl","either","i","go","to","the","movi","theater","hope","to","see","a","good","work","but","i","go","out","realli","disappointedbr","br","i","do","not","recommend","thi","movi"],"filtered":["sincer","consid","thi","movi","anoth","poor","effort","dominican","movi","industri","minut","movi","littl","funni","thei","switch","role","societi","man","woman","usual","woman","man","usual","movi","fall","becom","bore","funni","thei","let","mani","thing","without","explan","end","movi","predict","like","wai","roberto","angel","plai","hi","charact","hi","littl","either","go","movi","theater","hope","see","good","work","go","realli","disappointedbr","br","recommend","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["sincer","consid","anoth","poor","effort","dominican","industri","minut","littl","funni","switch","role","societi","man","woman","usual","woman","man","usual","fall","becom","bore","funni","let","mani","thing","without","explan","end","predict","like","wai","roberto","angel","plai","charact","littl","either","go","theater","hope","see","good","work","go","realli","disappointedbr","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,10,13,14,24,29,33,40,45,48,50,59,62,70,73,108,115,124,125,128,146,170,181,207,265,298,317,337,401,424,1000,1036,1049,1083,1579,2216,3580],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,10,13,14,24,29,33,40,45,48,50,59,62,70,73,108,115,124,125,128,146,170,181,207,265,298,317,337,401,424,1000,1036,1049,1083,1579,2216,3580],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,2.2350163994518417,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.6284968758320737,3.632592212924433,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.8693254449200722,4.045224089013853,4.189351572503368,1.8950689206770979,2.138507503627933,2.201553588425805,2.2323930368088845,2.2242236634876535,2.3409902041158843,2.326138445979858,2.4071371113909277,2.4442286541160034,2.5531798379045583,5.4705917319503,2.7819920465008363,2.8529247828056143,2.973659465713028,3.0879275592619675,3.212973749990824,4.062925891962901,4.327618446189983,4.176068548062782,4.191816905030921,4.605250182788262,5.02684467282631,5.649374286172302]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1506934972322399E-4,1.1429341019702236E-4,1.151819324769206E-4,1.1451641004399473E-4,1.1451828626644222E-4,1.1435821258736803E-4,1.1469832993467126E-4,1.1430986770127522E-4,1.1456687795475688E-4,1.2710569713135335E-4,0.8781649195658127,1.1412534637226336E-4,1.1625543936787631E-4,1.1791384875596763E-4,1.1420856538429384E-4,1.138929421859278E-4,1.1673385916037477E-4,1.1470907630240685E-4,1.143531918400341E-4,1.1444797030441819E-4,1.1555532154219761E-4,1.1482272397017581E-4,1.1495346706076116E-4,1.1507731652844017E-4,1.1596047581218183E-4,1.1535403516905644E-4,1.2020329966710617E-4,1.1415927479132868E-4,1.1416232881927638E-4,1.1445155843375024E-4,0.112845291370454,1.1470242989096609E-4,1.2312334184770975E-4,1.1502507090000282E-4,1.1428353202806162E-4,1.148110258648511E-4,1.1416901707304492E-4,1.1423648256218536E-4,1.1389236997857763E-4,1.1392191891386581E-4,1.1417834330806807E-4,1.1538268289304559E-4,1.1479637499381274E-4,1.1434250221715424E-4,1.1573188351452824E-4,1.1438638749432688E-4,1.1818687913012217E-4,1.1644890662301465E-4,1.139502347385931E-4,1.1420207172590049E-4,1.1416246214484341E-4,1.1737542297111207E-4,1.1420377083501122E-4,1.1391180525070707E-4,1.1516215033368622E-4,1.1423318669467463E-4,1.2284523773817063E-4,1.1413904370566738E-4,1.1394891696949952E-4,1.1449298960402239E-4,1.1562866383645087E-4,1.1448541524151317E-4,1.1392783616511319E-4,1.14193099682743E-4,1.1389374752695332E-4,1.165290127781443E-4,1.148748886978269E-4,1.1463018836573672E-4,1.1452993908524483E-4,1.1494741891877778E-4,1.1388959250241387E-4,1.1453234015176676E-4,1.163899786773524E-4,1.1409368897827957E-4,1.1691744833390916E-4,1.1439534110061282E-4,1.1529065640145876E-4,1.1458605062762547E-4,1.138538847608519E-4,1.1399501447056404E-4]}}
{"value":"Did anyone else notice whenever they are in the car each time the camera takes a new angle they switch roads. Like in one scene it is a one lane residential with sidewalks, next they are on a multiple lane highway with a divider, next a two lane country road with double yellow lanes. I can understand a low budget but that was just sloppy film work.<br /><br />I also read the other reviews and disagree that it was a bad movie. I think that if you are a fan of Paul Reiser and his comedy then you may enjoy this movie. If, however, you find his work/not funny then I would recommend staying away from this

{"value":"This solid little horror film is actually one of Renny Harlin's best. The story is pretty routine stuff, but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive; in fact, the ghost story is almost an afterthought. The real horror comes from the prison setting itself, and Renny H. spares no detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling, leaking, rat-infested old hellhole (with a sadistic warden, too!) Viggo Mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role, supported by some very authentic-looking prisoners (there are no pretty boys in this cast.) Horror fans should check this one

{"value":"Good Folks, I stumbled on this film on evening while I was grading papers. My academic specialty is Anglo-Saxon literature, and I can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves. The Icelandic \"Beowulf and Grendel\" is the least offensive I have seen, and I did pay $3.00 for my copy. This Sci-Fi version ranks with the Christopher Lambert version. Yuck.<br /><br />What didn't I like? CGI for one. Amazingly bad. More importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline, not to mention the stilted acting. I am used to both with all the versions I have seen.<br /><br />Delighted Regardless, Peter","finished_norm":["good","folk","i","stumbl","on","thi","film","on","even","while","i","be","grade","paper","my","academ","specialti","be","anglosaxon","literatur","and","i","can","sai","that","no","on","have","ever","do","the","genr","the","honor","it","deserv","the","iceland","beowulf","and","grendel","be","the","littl","offens","i","have","see","and","i","do","pai","for","my","copi","thi","scifi","version","rank","with","the","christoph","lambert","version","yuckbr","br","what","do","not","i","like","cgi","for","on","amazingli","bad","much","importantli","be","the","faith","to","the","storylin","not","to","mention","the","stilt","act","i","be","us","to","both","with","all","the","version","i","have","seenbr","br","delight","regardless","peter"],"filtered":["good","folk","stumbl","thi","film","even","grade","paper","academ","specialti","anglosaxon","literatur","sai","ever","genr","honor","deserv","iceland","beowulf","grendel","littl","offens","see","pai","copi","thi","scifi","version","rank","christoph","lambert","version","yuckbr","br","like","cgi","amazingli","bad","much","importantli","faith","storylin","mention","stilt","act","us","version","seenbr","br","delight","regardless","peter"],"filtered2":["good","folk","stumbl","even","grade","paper","academ","specialti","anglosaxon","literatur","ever","genr","honor","deserv","iceland","beowulf","grendel","littl","offens","see","pai","copi","scifi","version","rank","christoph","lambert","version","yuckbr","like","cgi","amazingli","bad","importantli","faith","storylin","mention","stilt","act","us","version","seenbr","delight","regardless","peter"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,9,14,21,44,56,220,285,322,423,467,515,747,760,781,938,1005,1012,1072,1145,1162,1399,1654,1779,2048,2163,2235,2690,2864,2894,2895,2930,3452,4369,4856],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,9,14,21,44,56,220,285,322,423,467,515,747,760,781,938,1005,1012,1072,1145,1162,1399,1654,1779,2048,2163,2235,2690,2864,2894,2895,2930,3452,4369,4856],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,1.604729392502474,1.8610609350701788,8.501080262633181,2.808171552082607,2.885344817328191,3.164467636384302,3.342254038012865,3.3956930001684253,3.7465885637507435,3.850067611308864,3.9363956947973615,3.952924996748572,4.086456389373095,4.297765483040301,4.268777946167049,4.2574141875167335,4.383707912841026,4.436351646326448,4.637773374493822,4.715065048795469,5.02684467282631,4.9909126636002465,5.039114765418124,5.243909178064138,6.389041482367141,5.339219357868463,5.3560264761848435,5.373120909544144,6.600350576034347,5.9370563586240825,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.409458240276536E-5,8.352751297391504E-5,8.417685973969864E-5,8.369048494735653E-5,8.369185612172743E-5,8.357487163169775E-5,8.38234350098536E-5,8.353954038999817E-5,8.372736773056936E-5,0.2615171470558369,0.2698344278133896,8.340468915337453E-5,0.10124174873087236,8.617338930381251E-5,8.346550698263582E-5,8.323484433331122E-5,8.531103340695842E-5,8.38312886329882E-5,0.07263306348716124,8.364046805464542E-5,8.444973863919494E-5,8.391434422672422E-5,8.400989343797177E-5,8.410040467567601E-5,8.474583207524E-5,8.430263523126408E-5,0.1714055328322198,8.342948460272526E-5,8.343171653682001E-5,8.364309031885838E-5,8.542090462252635E-5,8.382643132566935E-5,8.998057294684068E-5,8.406222270700775E-5,8.352029384479287E-5,8.390579505803116E-5,8.343660442320351E-5,8.348590931759554E-5,8.323442615472347E-5,8.325602100495494E-5,8.34434201898829E-5,8.43235714613849E-5,8.389508795935743E-5,8.356339023351744E-5,8.457877304642039E-5,8.359546231931909E-5,8.637292441331843E-5,0.020239690183060155,8.327671467761024E-5,8.346076130976838E-5,8.343181397334773E-5,8.577989884226721E-5,8.346200304678581E-5,8.324862977278111E-5,8.416240262250514E-5,8.348350064315151E-5,8.977732986766764E-5,8.3414699390987E-5,8.327575163017933E-5,8.36733689027808E-5,8.450333839988293E-5,8.366783343348588E-5,8.326034542995446E-5,8.345420439235775E-5,8.323543288984165E-5,8.516132828555272E-5,8.395246707176092E-5,8.377363602517521E-5,8.370037219428174E-5,8.40054733558593E-5,8.323239632924269E-5,8.370212693337576E-5,0.09699251518648905,8.338155340668412E-5,8.544520340895441E-5,8.360200576275929E-5,8.425631698051226E-5,8.374137943674748E-5,8.320630052160649E-5,8.330944044576016E-5]}}

{"value":"From beginning to end, this is the most emotionally overwrought movie about NOTHING I have ever seen. The characterizations and interactions between the title character and Marthe Kller's character are pure torture. The racetrack as metaphor gimmick is so overplayed that it borders on cliche, yet director Pollack treats every hairpin turn as if it were something profoundly important.<br /><br />Maybe there's some value for a MSFT3000 re-playing of some of the scenes, such as Pacino getting in touch with his inner female, for goof value.

please point out one line, just one scene, that is even worth a chuckle.<br /><br />She is a much better singer than I remember her to be, but I didn't want to watch a lounge act.<br /><br />I think

{"value":"This is the second British Rank film to adapt the stories of Sommerset Maugham to film. All but one story from 'Quartet' does not travel well into the contempory era; and the actors speech is decidedly \"clipped\", as only British pre-1950's actors delivery can be. In anycase 'Trio' seems tighter and more filmic than the first film adaptation.<br /><br />One of the problems these two films can't overcome is that their source material was written 25-30 years prior to the films. Consequently, by the 1950's Maughm's (pre-war) popularist \"small morality\" storyteling seemed rather quaint, if not downright coy.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","british","rank","film","to","adapt","the","stori","of","sommerset","maugham","to","film","all","but","on","stori","from","quartet","doe","not","travel","good","into","the","contempori","era","and","the","actor","speech","be","decidedli","clip","a","onli","british","pre","actor","deliveri","can","be","in","anycas","trio","seem","tight","and","much","filmic","than","the","film","adaptationbr","br","on","of","the","problem","thi","two","film","ca","not","overcom","be","that","their","sourc","materi","be","write","year","prior","to","the","film","consequ","by","the","maughm","prewar","popularist","small","moral","storytel","seem","rather","quaint","if","not","downright","coi"],"filtered":["thi","british","rank","film","adapt","stori","sommerset","maugham","film","stori","quartet","doe","travel","good","contempori","era","actor","speech","decidedli","clip","onli","british","pre","actor","deliveri","anycas","trio","seem","tight","much","filmic","film","adaptationbr","br","problem","thi","two","film","ca","overcom","sourc","materi","write","year","prior","film","consequ","maughm","prewar","popularist","small","moral","storytel","seem","rather","quaint","downright","coi"],"filtered2":["british","rank","adapt","stori","sommerset","maugham","stori","quartet","doe","travel","good","contempori","era","actor","speech","decidedli","clip","onli","british","pre","actor","deliveri","anycas","trio","seem","tight","filmic","adaptationbr","problem","two","ca","overcom","sourc","materi","write","year","prior","consequ","maughm","prewar","popularist","small","moral","storytel","seem","rather","quaint","downright","coi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,11,17,18,35,41,47,57,65,81,160,167,363,537,696,701,878,1032,1204,1556,1563,1588,1603,1654,2028,2074,2113,2307,2593,2605,3835,4960,5742,6181],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,11,17,18,35,41,47,57,65,81,160,167,363,537,696,701,878,1032,1204,1556,1563,1588,1603,1654,2028,2074,2113,2307,2593,2605,3835,4960,5742,6181],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9913098153388195,2.5541073880211935,1.2153159934048174,2.926338025798268,3.1375198335242067,1.7064694353107215,1.834162586674748,1.9073850067444174,1.949757232424728,2.3722295531801256,2.4609576687888097,3.0349689855553557,3.424750734647968,7.619092827806449,3.8240921249056035,4.067587905068712,4.140259095366071,4.3215761317340196,4.550761997504193,4.74221603786142,4.654440426979034,4.6973654716960676,4.637773374493822,4.979216623837056,4.933754249760298,5.00274712124725,5.0768550934009715,5.214056214914456,5.1994574154933035,5.770002273960917,6.101359409915359,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.247635208858755E-5,9.185276242724794E-5,9.256683006899667E-5,9.203197793871055E-5,9.203348577905264E-5,9.190484135773812E-5,9.2178179232996E-5,9.186598862485353E-5,9.207253685640706E-5,1.0214945360043246E-4,0.07318190929991851,9.171769666499977E-5,9.342956199071457E-5,9.476235522235302E-5,9.178457625261807E-5,9.153092328517166E-5,9.381404767072973E-5,9.218681563260005E-5,9.190080639621869E-5,9.197697582503601E-5,9.286690701172418E-5,9.227814943924734E-5,9.238322211157235E-5,9.248275467177729E-5,9.319251230115506E-5,9.270514169752008E-5,9.660228974059994E-5,9.174496349526204E-5,0.9195911913621356,9.197985945227688E-5,9.393486983221689E-5,9.218147419384161E-5,9.894900369576297E-5,9.244076707784299E-5,9.184482376214728E-5,9.226874816854077E-5,9.175279295355224E-5,9.180701210350473E-5,9.153046342641249E-5,9.155421065145658E-5,9.176028805277489E-5,9.272816465729634E-5,9.225697388536453E-5,9.189221560004656E-5,9.300880237445957E-5,9.192748433453654E-5,9.498177814489431E-5,9.35850434116735E-5,9.1576966877884E-5,9.177935757500001E-5,9.174752503599003E-5,9.432964527332106E-5,9.178072307687116E-5,9.154608272966486E-5,9.255093200016072E-5,9.18043633546842E-5,9.872550322745507E-5,9.172870463045357E-5,9.157590784279809E-5,9.201315592521901E-5,9.29258491004964E-5,9.200706873157507E-5,9.155896609511785E-5,9.177214712474559E-5,9.153157050357E-5,9.364942132833028E-5,9.232007201665366E-5,9.212341674641015E-5,9.204285065490365E-5,9.237836147658239E-5,9.152823128671364E-5,9.204478029015061E-5,9.35376855230261E-5,9.16922549611986E-5,9.396159049679293E-5,9.193467996785985E-5,9.265420687220472E-5,9.208794511977988E-5,9.149953449048671E-5,9.161295444772894E-5]}}
{"value":"This movie features an o.k. score and a not bad performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the \"special effects\" that this is a low budget movie. There is nothing in this movie that you could not find in other mad scientist, horror/comedy, or low budget movies. Not special for any nude scene buffs or bad movie lovers either. This movie is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are nothing to get excited about as well. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the one line summary.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","featur","a","okai","score","and","a","not","bad","perform","by","david","muir","a","dr","hackenstein","the","begin","and","end","credit","show","along","with","the","much","of","the","actor","and","the","special","effect","that","thi","be","a","low","budget","movi","there","be","noth","in","thi","movi","that","you","can","not","find","in","other","mad","scientist","horrorcomedi","or","low","budget","movi","not","special","for","ani","nude","scene","buff","or","bad","movi","lover","either","thi","movi","be","simpli","here","ann","ramsei","and","philli","diller","be","noth","to","get","excit","about","a","good","if","you","be","curiou","a","i","be","and","can","actual","find","thi","you","will","realiz","the","truth","of","the","on","line","summari"],"filtered":["thi","movi","featur","okai","score","bad","perform","david","muir","dr","hackenstein","begin","end","credit","show","along","much","actor","special","effect","thi","low","budget","movi","noth","thi","movi","find","mad","scientist","horrorcomedi","low","budget","movi","special","ani","nude","scene","buff","bad","movi","lover","either","thi","movi","simpli","ann","ramsei","philli","diller","noth","get","excit","good","curiou","actual","find","thi","realiz","truth","line","summari"],"filtered2":["featur","okai","score","bad","perform","david","muir","dr","hackenstein","begin","end","credit","show","along","actor","special","effect","low","budget","noth","find","mad","scientist","horrorcomedi","low","budget","special","ani","nude","scene","buff","bad","lover","either","simpli","ann","ramsei","philli","diller","noth","get","excit","good","curiou","actual","find","realiz","truth","line","summari"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,9,19,24,27,28,38,41,49,52,105,106,107,147,191,201,203,207,217,256,305,324,356,405,518,524,675,739,758,805,831,954,1286,1595,1839,1867,2331],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,9,19,24,27,28,38,41,49,52,105,106,107,147,191,201,203,207,217,256,305,324,356,405,518,524,675,739,758,805,831,954,1286,1595,1839,1867,2331],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,2.1367141713444147,1.312380678011735,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,3.038623282696244,1.5687599167621034,3.3840606616174704,1.7122153074726136,2.1765612129984904,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955,2.2844323215331563,2.5460113484259455,2.561435818751577,5.139521057275218,2.5531798379045583,5.222733058940145,5.497904384845272,2.8612813773965557,2.8753661172782943,3.028335462059722,3.109204957709252,3.4101163271295305,3.4028786598293,3.749984152751882,4.004218291136122,3.8240921249056035,4.096025840389245,3.9282323841582003,4.062925891962901,4.733083554298147,4.613282354485526,4.760735085628657,4.8184434032493035,5.089758498236879]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0435308110263982E-4,1.0364940388100587E-4,1.044551791613802E-4,1.0385163602338746E-4,1.0385333751551982E-4,1.0370817130353543E-4,1.0401661393585168E-4,1.0366432871789924E-4,1.0389740391898703E-4,0.0686073390028982,0.8834321262092123,1.0349699163588864E-4,1.0542871166091719E-4,0.039924156105855195,1.0357246056251929E-4,1.032862309688335E-4,1.0586257679987715E-4,1.0402635950742713E-4,1.0370361813229571E-4,1.0378956999353804E-4,1.0479379495703223E-4,1.0412942330608721E-4,1.0424799045162406E-4,1.0436030596897349E-4,1.0516121770250214E-4,1.0461125413906654E-4,1.0900891253089983E-4,1.0352776034254183E-4,1.0353052995258033E-4,1.0379282396474841E-4,1.0599891613995608E-4,1.0402033206820212E-4,1.116570147338634E-4,1.0431292591238417E-4,1.0364044565390904E-4,1.0411881463108703E-4,1.0353659533740803E-4,1.035977778475798E-4,1.0328571205045808E-4,1.0331250912933304E-4,1.0354505303150375E-4,1.0463723393535493E-4,1.0410552817785367E-4,1.0369392402099654E-4,1.0495391392757111E-4,1.0373372231566861E-4,1.0718027878664873E-4,1.0560416154583194E-4,1.0333818793573424E-4,1.0356657165063612E-4,1.0353065086169942E-4,1.0644439255303313E-4,1.035681125237814E-4,1.0330333733932651E-4,1.0443723930509106E-4,1.0359478892020272E-4,1.1140481012188359E-4,1.0350941335328808E-4,1.03336992888874E-4,1.0383039670051154E-4,1.048603069726026E-4,1.0382352772917272E-4,1.0331787531416687E-4,1.0355843516294828E-4,1.0328696130942857E-4,1.0567680751213983E-4,1.0417672999608211E-4,1.0395481830837493E-4,1.0386390512147665E-4,1.0424250556574932E-4,1.0328319323727217E-4,1.0386608257959297E-4,1.055507214880955E-4,1.034682824565126E-4,1.0602906853691643E-4,1.0374184208348833E-4,1.0455377775902952E-4,1.0391479106414448E-4,1.0325081091426285E-4,1.0337879738571686E-4]}}
{"value":"For me this is a story that starts with some funny jokes regarding Franks fanatasies when he is travelling with a staircase and when he is sitting in business meetings... The problem is that when you have been watching this movie for an hour you will see the same fantasies/funny situations again and again and again. It is to predictable. It is more done as a TV story where you can go away and come back without missing anything.<br /><br />I like Felix Herngren as Frank but that is not enough even when it is a comedy it has to have more variations and some kind of message to it's audience....<br /><br />","finished_norm":["for","me","thi","be","a","stori","that","start","with","some","funni","joke","regard","frank","fanatasi","when","he","be","travel","with","a","staircas","and","when","he","be","sit","in","busi","meet","the","problem","be","that","when","you","have","be","watch","thi","movi","for","a","hour","you","will","see","the","same","fantasiesfunni","situat","again","and","again","and","again","it","be","to","predict","it","be","much","do","a","a","tv","stori","where","you","can","go","awai","and","come","back","without","miss","anythingbr","br","i","like","felix","herngren","a","frank","but","that","be","not","enough","even","when","it","be","a","comedi","it","have","to","have","much","variat","and","some","kind","of","messag","to","it","audiencebr","br"],"filtered":["thi","stori","start","funni","joke","regard","frank","fanatasi","travel","staircas","sit","busi","meet","problem","watch","thi","movi","hour","see","fantasiesfunni","situat","predict","much","tv","stori","go","awai","come","back","without","miss","anythingbr","br","like","felix","herngren","frank","enough","even","comedi","much","variat","kind","messag","audiencebr","br"],"filtered2":["stori","start","funni","joke","regard","frank","fanatasi","travel","staircas","sit","busi","meet","problem","watch","hour","see","fantasiesfunni","situat","predict","tv","stori","go","awai","come","back","without","miss","anythingbr","like","felix","herngren","frank","enough","even","comedi","variat","kind","messag","audiencebr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,7,17,34,62,63,71,93,122,125,127,155,167,172,174,214,244,255,337,350,473,569,790,1019,1032,1435,3504,3796,5281,7580],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,7,17,34,62,63,71,93,122,125,127,155,167,172,174,214,244,255,337,350,473,569,790,1019,1032,1435,3504,3796,5281,7580],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,2.5541073880211935,1.3982850089458962,2.0226120445069267,1.8729627573220065,1.9214926742550966,2.035389827120098,2.2489347673732487,2.2242236634876535,2.4359679371086367,2.3074766467914385,2.4609576687888097,2.5001408943598484,2.456282578459816,2.7303758068497004,2.634508058031767,2.6754694156628323,2.973659465713028,3.0135689919434205,3.335489637924323,3.6436037491933098,3.749984152751882,4.091229668125752,4.140259095366071,9.394730943392135,5.604922523601468,5.770002273960917,6.214688095222362,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.2296570764242377E-4,1.2213652112875518E-4,1.230860161173559E-4,1.223748238049506E-4,1.2237682877865995E-4,1.2220577042759055E-4,1.2256922751145523E-4,1.221541079897338E-4,1.2242875495494863E-4,1.3582802050011054E-4,0.4391645820488426,1.219569243274324E-4,1.2423318984192198E-4,1.2600540359352475E-4,1.2204585404440956E-4,1.2170857196165861E-4,1.2474444004431052E-4,1.225807113228817E-4,1.2220040514352232E-4,1.2230168755252425E-4,1.2348502811097687E-4,1.2270215778905827E-4,1.228418728104072E-4,1.2297422115052485E-4,1.2391798512023078E-4,1.232699289436346E-4,1.2845196257797972E-4,1.2199318100281633E-4,1.2199644460610125E-4,1.2230552190861899E-4,1.2490509714475413E-4,1.2257360881740947E-4,0.2220096868615287,1.2291839029124324E-4,1.2212596509416049E-4,1.2268965692933508E-4,1.2200359182523056E-4,1.2207568697162317E-4,1.2170796048795252E-4,1.2173953714799738E-4,1.2201355805074605E-4,1.2330054254891824E-4,1.226740006774388E-4,1.2218898197093107E-4,1.2367370622484993E-4,1.2223587876991008E-4,1.2629717002173997E-4,0.32935014655176875,1.2176979607822896E-4,1.2203891477429596E-4,1.2199658708081528E-4,1.254300296315884E-4,1.2204073048069095E-4,1.2172872945898059E-4,1.2306487647202594E-4,1.220721649331157E-4,1.3127519730762147E-4,1.2197156160746301E-4,1.2176838788039443E-4,1.2234979619350214E-4,1.2356340334412682E-4,1.2234170205854678E-4,1.2174586045640819E-4,1.2202932704621272E-4,1.2170943256727891E-4,1.2452553657080044E-4,1.2275790219593136E-4,1.2249640989091547E-4,1.2238928124418217E-4,1.2283540962919782E-4,1.2170499241415392E-4,1.223918470781308E-4,1.243769615885708E-4,1.2192309452077499E-4,1.2494062758420228E-4,1.2224544679593572E-4,1.2320220096024111E-4,1.224492433064719E-4,1.2166683431453797E-4,1.2181764871181983E-4]}}
{"value":"The plot was dull, the girls were sickening and the supposed Italian male lead had clearly never heard an Italian accent.Someone said the boys were cute in this film but it just seemed to be filled with mediocre people. There were literally no redeeming features about this film.<br /><br />I think this is a graveyard for actors that will never work again, with the unfortunate exception of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason.<br /><br />I hope the Olsen twins find something out of the limelight to keep them away from the entertainment business. They have no place in it.","finished_norm":["the","plot","be","dull","the","girl","be","sicken","and","the","suppos","italian","male","lead","have","clearli","never","hear","a","italian","accentsomeon","sai","the","boi","be","cute","in","thi","film","but","it","just","seem","to","be","fill","with","mediocr","peopl","there","be","liter","no","redeem","featur","about","thi","filmbr","br","i","think","thi","be","a","graveyard","for","actor","that","will","never","work","again","with","the","unfortun","except","of","the","olsen","twin","who","seem","to","fascin","peopl","for","no","discern","reasonbr","br","i","hope","the","olsen","twin","find","someth","out","of","the","limelight","to","keep","them","awai","from","the","entertain","busi","thei","have","no","place","in","it"],"filtered":["plot","dull","girl","sicken","suppos","italian","male","lead","clearli","never","hear","italian","accentsomeon","sai","boi","cute","thi","film","seem","fill","mediocr","peopl","liter","redeem","featur","thi","filmbr","br","think","thi","graveyard","actor","never","work","unfortun","except","olsen","twin","seem","fascin","peopl","discern","reasonbr","br","hope","olsen","twin","find","someth","limelight","keep","awai","entertain","busi","thei","place"],"filtered2":["plot","dull","girl","sicken","suppos","italian","male","lead","clearli","never","hear","italian","accentsomeon","boi","cute","seem","fill","mediocr","peopl","liter","redeem","featur","filmbr","think","graveyard","actor","never","work","unfortun","except","olsen","twin","seem","fascin","peopl","discern","reasonbr","hope","olsen","twin","find","someth","limelight","keep","awai","entertain","busi","place"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,23,32,35,38,41,42,48,53,84,134,149,155,157,164,181,195,216,227,233,282,305,367,494,553,566,634,649,787,790,855,897,1030,1258,1719,3338,3738,4531,4891,5797],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[12,23,32,35,38,41,42,48,53,84,134,149,155,157,164,181,195,216,227,233,282,305,367,494,553,566,634,649,787,790,855,897,1030,1258,1719,3338,3738,4531,4891,5797],"values":[1.066728610262888,2.729695454751562,1.3711311285073675,2.926338025798268,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,3.2439908614907673,1.6955116224012472,1.7003182735607676,2.2212694515902225,2.2443961816702407,2.3253197803590226,2.3074766467914385,2.3360150694757706,2.3930275298746078,2.4442286541160034,2.51289241584188,2.6070186965339692,2.6005321873043625,2.6102777977348763,2.918851229218033,2.8612813773965557,3.0791938792932125,3.3243163373261977,3.454678155189441,3.439602492783994,3.5119855004467477,3.6375061693251913,3.760240652919071,3.749984152751882,3.9201351739255808,3.8844878351953436,8.595530966080602,4.34596758485818,9.845408827147427,5.604922523601468,5.719991853386255,5.999576715605417,6.1754673820690815,13.321950395701563]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.4326773474519E-5,8.375813832699E-5,8.440927798498114E-5,8.392156027754177E-5,8.392293523782178E-5,8.380562774536624E-5,8.405487742453607E-5,8.377019895161703E-5,8.395854489671976E-5,9.314742244652834E-5,0.3507035202214532,8.363497538122034E-5,8.519598072237123E-5,8.641132010800232E-5,8.369596113279665E-5,8.34646616076326E-5,8.554658318570993E-5,8.406275273207793E-5,8.38019483691977E-5,8.387140528466306E-5,8.468291032236041E-5,8.414603764816473E-5,8.424185067752196E-5,8.43326118231357E-5,8.497982129326074E-5,8.453540075154758E-5,8.808910840548538E-5,8.365983929255511E-5,8.366207738917729E-5,8.387403478913241E-5,8.565675776345136E-5,8.405788201339106E-5,9.022901565352384E-5,8.429432443135963E-5,8.375089926534329E-5,8.413746487461407E-5,8.366697877135975E-5,8.371641980004181E-5,8.346424227442429E-5,8.348589674955996E-5,8.367381335685153E-5,8.455639478807603E-5,8.412672821288592E-5,8.379411464623596E-5,8.481230100268277E-5,8.3826275285328E-5,8.661140614801534E-5,8.533776017483211E-5,8.350664755890463E-5,8.369120235679179E-5,8.366217509473412E-5,0.059516196062233795,8.369244752233268E-5,8.347848510967292E-5,8.439478095066768E-5,8.37140044750778E-5,0.5832826425813351,8.364501325780471E-5,8.350568185243185E-5,8.390439697436006E-5,8.473665807576712E-5,8.38988462212441E-5,8.349023311460183E-5,8.368462733526985E-5,8.346525178920913E-5,8.539646471790792E-5,8.418426575306472E-5,8.400494094134951E-5,8.393147482385292E-5,8.42374183912511E-5,8.346220684445222E-5,8.393323440790532E-5,8.529457575137676E-5,8.361177575510196E-5,8.568112364054212E-5,8.383283679567695E-5,8.448895461283941E-5,8.397259529020663E-5,8.343603898445106E-5,8.3539463685208E-5]}}
{"value":"This was recently on AMC's vibrant movie classics and I had to laugh. I had high hopes for this adventure that follows in the vein of \"Voyage to the Earth's Core\" and \"Mysterious Island\". I was sorely disappointed not only in the acting credentials but in the silly story line that reads from a five year old's comic book. Be sure to catch sight of the wires that are holding on to the Pterdactyl's wings when they grasp \"Ogar\" a half idiot pre-modern man who befriends the lost adventurers. The ending left it open for further rehashing of the same effects in \"People that Time Forgot\".
