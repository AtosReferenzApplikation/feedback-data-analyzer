{"value":"A perfect little atrocity...I doubt if a single shot lasted for more then the reglamentary-MTV 4.4 seconds. Woeful casting, worse even than in Kusminsky's version (a reminder: he managed to miscast Juliet Binoche and Ralph Feinnnes). But, hey-the rich got what they deserved. Dark and brooding Heathcliff reduced to the state of a golden-locked angel, frail and angellic Catherine presented as a chubby, melon-breasted heffer, meek and weak Linton is a peeping tom, and innocent Isabel becomes Sara Michelle-Gellar's character from Cruel Intentions. 15-year old Eddie Bauer and Abercrombie and Fitch donners-take notice. This thing was made for you. It is an hour-and-a-half long music video where everything is given to you; you are saved from the uncomfortable necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters, but even from initial shock at their actions. The actors tried, but, as I stated before, they were miscasted. Decent photography, but editing is on the level of TV production class in high school. I implore you all: read the book, or the cliffnotes even; watch the previous versions of it, even Kusminsky's; but stay away from the numerous future reruns, during which you will not receive the benefit of the commercial-free premiere.","finished_norm":["a","perfect","littl","atrocityi","doubt","if","a","singl","shoot","last","for","much","then","the","reglamentarymtv","second","woeful","cast","wrong","even","than","in","kusminski","version","a","remind","he","manag","to","miscast","juliet","binoch","and","ralph","feinnn","but","heyth","rich","get","what","thei","deserv","dark","and","brood","heathcliff","reduc","to","the","state","of","a","goldenlock","angel","frail","and","angel","catherin","present","a","a","chubbi","melonbreast","heffer","meek","and","weak","linton","be","a","peep","tom","and","innoc","isabel","becom","sara","michellegellar","charact","from","cruel","intent","year","old","eddi","bauer","and","abercrombi","and","fitch","donnerstak","notic","thi","thing","be","make","for","you","it","be","a","hourandahalf","long","music","video","where","everyth","be","give","to","you","you","be","save","from","the","uncomfort","necess","of","not","even","try","to","understand","the","complex","of","the","charact","but","even","from","initi","shock","at","their","action","the","actor","try","but","a","i","state","befor","thei","be","miscast","decent","photographi","but","edit","be","on","the","level","of","tv","product","class","in","high","school","i","implor","you","all","read","the","book","or","the","cliffnot","even","watch","the","previou","version","of","it","even","kusminski","but","stai","awai","from","the","numer","futur","rerun","dure","which","you","will","not","receiv","the","benefit","of","the","commercialfre","premier"],"filtered":["perfect","littl","atrocityi","doubt","singl","shoot","last","much","reglamentarymtv","second","woeful","cast","wrong","even","kusminski","version","remind","manag","miscast","juliet","binoch","ralph","feinnn","heyth","rich","get","thei","deserv","dark","brood","heathcliff","reduc","state","goldenlock","angel","frail","angel","catherin","present","chubbi","melonbreast","heffer","meek","weak","linton","peep","tom","innoc","isabel","becom","sara","michellegellar","charact","cruel","intent","year","old","eddi","bauer","abercrombi","fitch","donnerstak","notic","thi","thing","make","hourandahalf","long","music","video","everyth","give","save","uncomfort","necess","even","try","understand","complex","charact","even","initi","shock","action","actor","try","state","befor","thei","miscast","decent","photographi","edit","level","tv","product","class","high","school","implor","read","book","cliffnot","even","watch","previou","version","even","kusminski","stai","awai","numer","futur","rerun","dure","receiv","benefit","commercialfre","premier"],"filtered2":["perfect","littl","atrocityi","doubt","singl","shoot","last","reglamentarymtv","second","woeful","cast","wrong","even","kusminski","version","remind","manag","miscast","juliet","binoch","ralph","feinnn","heyth","rich","get","deserv","dark","brood","heathcliff","reduc","state","goldenlock","angel","frail","angel","catherin","present","chubbi","melonbreast","heffer","meek","weak","linton","peep","tom","innoc","isabel","becom","sara","michellegellar","charact","cruel","intent","year","old","eddi","bauer","abercrombi","fitch","donnerstak","notic","thing","make","hourandahalf","long","music","video","everyth","give","save","uncomfort","necess","even","try","understand","complex","charact","even","initi","shock","action","actor","try","state","befor","miscast","decent","photographi","edit","level","tv","product","class","high","school","implor","read","book","cliffnot","even","watch","previou","version","even","kusminski","stai","awai","numer","futur","rerun","dure","receiv","benefit","commercialfre","premier"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,7,10,14,25,29,30,36,41,57,67,79,92,99,115,117,118,129,144,145,151,155,172,189,190,193,211,212,220,239,240,296,309,345,348,366,368,379,411,423,443,445,498,508,567,628,644,677,688,759,784,811,844,937,947,1031,1036,1153,1226,1372,1472,1541,1593,1619,1984,2013,2059,2442,2484,2852,3436,4021,4816,4827,5488,5495,6324,7010,7075,7179,7814,8029,8612],"values":[1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,7,10,14,25,29,30,36,41,57,67,79,92,99,115,117,118,129,144,145,151,155,172,189,190,193,211,212,220,239,240,296,309,345,348,366,368,379,411,423,443,445,498,508,567,628,644,677,688,759,784,811,844,937,947,1031,1036,1153,1226,1372,1472,1541,1593,1619,1984,2013,2059,2442,2484,2852,3436,4021,4816,4827,5488,5495,6324,7010,7075,7179,7814,8029,8612],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,4.630085528630655,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.1175081997259209,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,2.9360366939211433,1.5687599167621034,1.834162

{"value":"There's really not a lot to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's harmless enough, but it is little more than a dull heist film from the 70s. The movie is neither as clever nor as sexy as it strives to be. The plot is a retread of the tired old casino robbery storyline that's been done to death. Except in the case of Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery plot was designed by a 3 year-old. The plan involves three women  one to unnecessarily and in plain view scale the outside of the Circus Cicus building, one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity, and one to stand around exposing her cleavage. That's pretty much it. Intricate, huh? Other than Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts, the other women involved in the plot aren't particularly memorable. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. When not pawing Stevens, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most idiotic gun fights ever put on film.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie. It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975. But the movie itself is too dull to rate any higher than a 4/10  and that's probably overstating it. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a waste of some perfectly good cleavage.","finished_norm":["there","realli","not","a","lot","to","sai","about","la","vega","ladi","it","harmless","enough","but","it","be","littl","much","than","a","dull","heist","film","from","the","the","movi","be","neither","a","clever","nor","a","sexi","a","it","strive","to","be","the","plot","be","a","retread","of","the","tire","old","casino","robberi","storylin","that","be","do","to","death","except","in","the","case","of","la","vega","ladi","i","think","the","robberi","plot","be","design","by","a","yearold","the","plan","involv","three","woman","on","to","unnecessarili","and","in","plain","view","scale","the","outsid","of","the","circu","cicu","build","on","to","pose","a","a","waitress","onli","to","blow","her","cover","at","the","opportun","and","on","to","stand","around","expos","her","cleavag","that","pretti","much","it","intric","huh","other","than","stella","steven","and","her","aforement","breast","the","other","woman","involv","in","the","plot","be","not","particularli","memor","la","vega","ladi","costar","stuart","whitman","when","not","paw","steven","hi","involv","in","the","movi","be","highlight","by","on","of","the","much","idiot","gun","fight","ever","put","on","filmbr","br","i","realli","want","to","like","thi","movi","it","doe","have","that","feel","to","it","that","i","alwai","enjoi","and","some","nice","shot","of","la","vega","circa","but","the","movi","itself","be","too","dull","to","rate","ani","high","than","a","and","that","probabl","overst","it","in","the","end","la","vega","ladi","be","a","wast","of","some","perfectli","good","cleavag"],"filtered":["realli","lot","sai","la","vega","ladi","harmless","enough","littl","much","dull","heist","film","movi","neither","clever","sexi","strive","plot","retread","tire","old","casino","robberi","storylin","death","except","case","la","vega","ladi","think","robberi","plot","design","yearold","plan","involv","three","woman","unnecessarili","plain","view","scale","outsid","circu","cicu","build","pose","waitress","onli","blow","cover","opportun","stand","around","expos","cleavag","pretti","much","intric","huh","stella","steven","aforement","breast","woman","involv","plot","particularli","memor","la","vega","ladi","costar","stuart","whitman","paw","steven","hi","involv","movi","highlight","much","idiot","gun","fight","ever","put","filmbr","br","realli","want","like","thi","movi","doe","feel","alwai","enjoi","nice","shot","la","vega","circa","movi","dull","rate","ani","high","probabl","overst","end","la","vega","ladi","wast","perfectli","good","cleavag"],"filtered2":["realli","lot","la","vega","ladi","harmless","enough","littl","dull","heist","neither","clever","sexi","strive","plot","retread","tire","old","casino","robberi","storylin","death","except","case","la","vega","ladi","think","robberi","plot","design","yearold","plan","involv","three","woman","unnecessarili","plain","view","scale","outsid","circu","cicu","build","pose","waitress","onli","blow","cover","opportun","stand","around","expos","cleavag","pretti","intric","huh","stella","steven","aforement","breast","woman","involv","plot","particularli","memor","la","vega","ladi","costar","stuart","whitman","paw","steven","involv","highlight","idiot","gun","fight","ever","put","filmbr","realli","want","like","doe","feel","alwai","enjoi","nice","shot","la","vega","circa","dull","rate","ani","high","probabl","overst","end","la","vega","ladi","wast","perfectli","good","cleavag"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,11,12,13,14,18,24,27,32,37,43,44,67,70,72,78,89,93,98,148,159,197,200,202,211,224,232,233,241,245,262,288,312,367,377,441,472,477,491,497,501,515,566,581,586,681,705,718,754,766,791,900,955,993,1074,1087,1194,1385,1475,1645,1669,1790,1928,1939,2141,2368,2462,2787,3037,3838,4028,4114,4220,4342,4549,4775,4958,5386,6130,6433,6554,6751,7335],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,11,12,13,14,18,24,27,32,37,43,44,67,70,72,78,89,93,98,148,159,197,200,202,211,224,232,233,241,245,262,288,312,367,377,441,472,477,491,497,501,515,566,581,586,681,705,718,754,766,791,900,955,993,1074,1087,1194,1385,1475,1645,1669,1790,1928,1939,2141,2368,2462,2787,3037,3838,4028,4114,4220,4342,4549,4775,4958,5386,6130,6433,6554,6751,7335],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,4.1133933855221025,1.4876543214774305,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.9570915389266579,4.189351572503368,1.9209463754160525,2.0064197866819473,1.9940046109572438,2.035389827120098,2.0881990796736947,2.3018654096236517,2.30026796519

{"value":"(spoilers)Wow, this is a bad one. I did a double take when watching an old Star Trek episode the other day-it was the one where everyone gets infected with that space sickness and then go a bit nuts-and there was Stewart Moss, a.k.a the unlikable 'hero' of It Lives by Night! He played the first crewmember infected, who dies from terminal depression. All I could think was that he'd watched his own movie too many times, that's what caused the depression. This movie is full of truly unlikable people. There is no redeeming character in the film, not one. It's very hard to feel bad about Dr. Beck's turning into a bat(or whatever he actually turned into), because you just don't like him. And you don't like his shrill, bony wife, or the nasty sleazy Sgt. Ward, or Dr. Mustache Love...So why would you invest any time or energy in this movie? Where there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to bother caring about it. Not to mention the horrible cinematography, which made it look like they'd filmed the movie through urine, and the five cent bat special effects, many of which appeared to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of bats flying. Not the worst film I've ever seen on MST3K, but down there in the bottom ranks, definitely.","finished_norm":["spoilerswow","thi","be","a","bad","on","i","do","a","doubl","take","when","watch","a","old","star","trek","episod","the","other","dayit","be","the","on","where","everyon","get","infect","with","that","space","sick","and","then","go","a","bite","nutsand","there","be","stewart","moss","aka","the","unlik","hero","of","it","live","by","night","he","plai","the","crewmemb","infect","who","die","from","termin","depress","all","i","can","think","be","that","he","have","watch","hi","own","movi","too","mani","time","that","what","caus","the","depress","thi","movi","be","full","of","truli","unlik","peopl","there","be","no","redeem","charact","in","the","film","not","on","it","veri","hard","to","feel","bad","about","dr","beck","turn","into","a","bator","whatev","he","actual","turn","into","becaus","you","just","do","not","like","him","and","you","do","not","like","hi","shrill","boni","wife","or","the","nasti","sleazi","sgt","ward","or","dr","mustach","loveso","why","would","you","invest","ani","time","or","energi","in","thi","movi","where","there","be","no","empathi","with","the","charact","there","be","no","reason","to","bother","care","about","it","not","to","mention","the","horribl","cinematographi","which","make","it","look","like","thei","have","film","the","movi","through","urin","and","the","five","cent","bat","special","effect","mani","of","which","appear","to","be","piec","of","paper","throw","into","a","fan","to","simul","hord","of","bat","fly","not","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","on","mstk","but","down","there","in","the","bottom","rank","definit"],"filtered":["spoilerswow","thi","bad","doubl","take","watch","old","star","trek","episod","dayit","everyon","get","infect","space","sick","go","bite","nutsand","stewart","moss","aka","unlik","hero","live","night","plai","crewmemb","infect","die","termin","depress","think","watch","hi","movi","mani","time","caus","depress","thi","movi","full","truli","unlik","peopl","redeem","charact","film","veri","hard","feel","bad","dr","beck","turn","bator","whatev","actual","turn","becaus","like","like","hi","shrill","boni","wife","nasti","sleazi","sgt","ward","dr","mustach","loveso","invest","ani","time","energi","thi","movi","empathi","charact","reason","bother","care","mention","horribl","cinematographi","make","look","like","thei","film","movi","urin","five","cent","bat","special","effect","mani","appear","piec","paper","throw","fan","simul","hord","bat","fly","wrong","film","ever","see","mstk","bottom","rank","definit"],"filtered2":["spoilerswow","bad","doubl","take","watch","old","star","trek","dayit","everyon","get","infect","space","sick","go","bite","nutsand","stewart","moss","aka","unlik","hero","live","night","plai","crewmemb","infect","die","termin","depress","think","watch","mani","time","caus","depress","full","truli","unlik","peopl","redeem","charact","veri","hard","feel","bad","dr","beck","turn","bator","whatev","actual","turn","becaus","like","like","shrill","boni","wife","nasti","sleazi","sgt","ward","dr","mustach","loveso","invest","ani","time","energi","empathi","charact","reason","bother","care","mention","horribl","cinematographi","make","look","like","urin","five","cent","bat","special","effect","mani","appear","piec","paper","throw","fan","simul","hord","bat","fly","wrong","ever","see","mstk","bottom","rank","definit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,8,9,10,12,15,16,22,23,25,27,31,40,43,44,50,52,67,95,96,100,106,116,140,154,170,171,203,205,210,218,230,246,263,285,293,310,336,342,375,392,452,496,504,557,615,629,634,637,652,739,778,860,1052,1075,1307,1374,1400,1474,1548,1655,1714,2156,2224,2304,2473,2636,2688,2940,3242,3345,4189,4748,4832,5877,5887,6025,6786,7719],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,7,8,9,10,12,15,16,22,23,25,27,31,40,43,44,50,52,67,95,96,100,106,116,140,154,170,171,203,205,210,218,230,246,263,285,293,310,336,342,375,392,452,496,504,557,615,629,634,637,652,739,778,860,1052,1075,1307,1374,1400,1474,1548,1655,1714,2156,2224,2304,2473,2636,2688,2940,3242,3345,4189,4748,4832,5877,5887,6025,6786,7719],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.8837873718108231,2.1367141713444147,2.247774048205673,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,3.43598877114071,1.7122153074726136,1.9570915389266579,2.0323326556775485,4.078141625743051,2.1405462403177813,2.159084361316692,2.2466

{"value":"I was so excited when I discovered this was available! I couldn't wait to see it. What a waste of energy! It's kind of like that rarities CD by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store. Being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery. But once you heard it it became obvious why these dogs never made it onto a real album. This DVD is only recommended for 'completionists' who must have everything Lynch has done. \"Six Men Getting Sick\" is somewhat visually interesting but short and repetitive. It lacks the power of Lynch's later work \"The Grandmother\" is quite simply an immature work. It's tedious and looks like a student film. But it was the 70's...It's interesting only if you hope to psychoanalyze the director. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds. \"The Alpahabet\" is forgettable (No really! I can't remember this one at all!) \"The Amputee\" is pointless. \"The Cowboy and the Frenchman\" is just plain silly. \"Lumiere\" is the only worthwhile one in the bunch. Without dialog Lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work. I had to watch this one several times. But it runs less than 2 minutes. Hardly worth the trouble of renting or buying the DVD.","finished_norm":["i","be","so","excit","when","i","discov","thi","be","avail","i","can","not","wait","to","see","it","what","a","wast","of","energi","it","kind","of","like","that","rariti","cd","by","your","favorit","band","you","find","in","the","back","of","the","rack","at","your","local","music","store","be","a","hard","core","fan","you","be","certain","that","it","be","a","valuabl","discoveri","but","onc","you","hear","it","it","becom","obviou","why","thi","dog","never","make","it","onto","a","real","album","thi","dvd","be","onli","recommend","for","completionist","who","must","have","everyth","lynch","have","do","six","man","get","sick","be","somewhat","visual","interest","but","short","and","repetit","it","lack","the","power","of","lynch","late","work","the","grandmoth","be","quit","simpli","a","immatur","work","it","tediou","and","look","like","a","student","film","but","it","be","the","sit","interest","onli","if","you","hope","to","psychoanalyz","the","director","but","you","can","see","briefli","the","se","of","some","of","hi","trademark","imag","and","sound","the","alpahabet","be","forgett","no","realli","i","ca","not","rememb","thi","on","at","all","the","ampute","be","pointless","the","cowboi","and","the","frenchman","be","just","plain","silli","lumier","be","the","onli","worthwhil","on","in","the","bunch","without","dialog","lynch","tell","a","disturb","tale","compar","with","hi","well","work","i","have","to","watch","thi","on","sever","time","but","it","run","littl","than","minut","hardli","worth","the","troubl","of","rent","or","bui","the","dvd"],"filtered":["excit","discov","thi","avail","wait","see","wast","energi","kind","like","rariti","cd","favorit","band","find","back","rack","local","music","store","hard","core","fan","certain","valuabl","discoveri","onc","hear","becom","obviou","thi","dog","never","make","onto","real","album","thi","dvd","onli","recommend","completionist","must","everyth","lynch","six","man","get","sick","somewhat","visual","interest","short","repetit","lack","power","lynch","late","work","grandmoth","quit","simpli","immatur","work","tediou","look","like","student","film","sit","interest","onli","hope","psychoanalyz","director","see","briefli","se","hi","trademark","imag","sound","alpahabet","forgett","realli","ca","rememb","thi","ampute","pointless","cowboi","frenchman","plain","silli","lumier","onli","worthwhil","bunch","without","dialog","lynch","tell","disturb","tale","compar","hi","well","work","watch","thi","sever","time","run","littl","minut","hardli","worth","troubl","rent","bui","dvd"],"filtered2":["excit","discov","avail","wait","see","wast","energi","kind","like","rariti","cd","favorit","band","find","back","rack","local","music","store","hard","core","fan","certain","valuabl","discoveri","onc","hear","becom","obviou","dog","never","make","onto","real","album","dvd","onli","recommend","completionist","must","everyth","lynch","six","man","get","sick","somewhat","visual","interest","short","repetit","lack","power","lynch","late","work","grandmoth","quit","simpli","immatur","work","tediou","look","like","student","sit","interest","onli","hope","psychoanalyz","director","see","briefli","se","trademark","imag","sound","alpahabet","forgett","realli","ca","rememb","ampute","pointless","cowboi","frenchman","plain","silli","lumier","onli","worthwhil","bunch","without","dialog","lynch","tell","disturb","tale","compar","well","work","watch","sever","time","run","littl","minut","hardli","worth","troubl","rent","bui","dvd"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14,16,20,38,42,45,48,58,59,60,63,80,81,89,90,115,118,120,122,125,137,140,141,150,171,178,181,183,193,201,216,219,236,244,247,272,290,298,316,331,347,365,383,385,419,432,475,482,524,531,586,596,609,626,635,661,665,742,752,774,778,783,793,820,822,839,927,1240,1297,1348,1374,1391,1586,1736,1806,1835,2022,2208,2406,2728,2896,3143,3424,3537,3549,3568,4289,4650],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,8,11,13,14,16,20,38,42,45,48,58,59,60,63,80,81,89,90,115,118,120,122,125,137,140,141,150,171,178,181,183,193,201,216,219,236,244,247,272,290,298,316,331,347,365,383,385,419,432,475,482,524,531,586,596,609,626,635,661,665,742,752,774,778,783,793,820,822,839,927,1240,1297,1348,1374,1391,1586,1736,1806,1835,2022,2208,2406,2728,2896,3143,3424,3537,3549,3568,4289,4650],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.9739294460164585,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.5193116

{"value":"Fantastic Mr. Fox is a comedy based on the classic Roald Dahl book. Wes Anderson directs, and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film. While I respect what Anderson, an incredibly talented man did, the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit. Anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man, and if this happened to be a bad film, it would be his first bad film. Just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is Anderson's first bad day in film making, so I am going to let him off easy. I will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it, and the animation is nice, but the film gets progressively harder to get into, leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening. The characters are good, also. Jason Schwartzman voices Mr. Fox (George Clooney)'s smart ass son, Ash, and especially engaging. The film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness, but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along. I'm sure Wes Anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film, but for now, I'm sorry, Wes Anderson, this film of yours was a big disappointment.","finished_norm":["fantast","mr","fox","be","a","comedi","base","on","the","classic","roald","dahl","book","we","anderson","direct","and","respect","take","the","short","book","of","the","same","name","to","the","big","screen","in","a","full","length","film","while","i","respect","what","anderson","a","incredibli","talent","man","do","the","film","seem","to","have","get","lose","in","it","own","clever","spirit","anderson","seem","to","have","leav","the","stori","behind","know","that","he","be","a","talent","man","and","if","thi","happen","to","be","a","bad","film","it","would","be","hi","bad","film","just","like","when","you","go","to","school","and","have","your","bad","dai","thi","be","anderson","bad","dai","in","film","make","so","i","be","go","to","let","him","off","easi","i","will","admit","it","do","have","a","clever","and","nice","spirit","to","it","and","the","anim","be","nice","but","the","film","get","progress","hard","to","get","into","leav","the","stori","behind","and","have","random","shot","of","random","thing","happen","the","charact","be","good","conjur","jason","schwartzman","voic","mr","fox","georg","cloonei","smart","ass","son","ash","and","especi","engag","the","film","doe","not","quit","make","it","up","to","a","level","of","terribl","but","it","certainli","get","close","and","close","a","it","go","along","i","be","sure","we","anderson","will","get","back","on","track","with","anoth","amaz","film","when","and","where","he","decid","to","make","anoth","film","but","for","now","i","be","sorri","we","anderson","thi","film","of","your","be","a","big","disappoint"],"filtered":["fantast","mr","fox","comedi","base","classic","roald","dahl","book","anderson","direct","respect","take","short","book","name","big","screen","full","length","film","respect","anderson","incredibli","talent","man","film","seem","get","lose","clever","spirit","anderson","seem","leav","stori","behind","know","talent","man","thi","happen","bad","film","hi","bad","film","like","go","school","bad","dai","thi","anderson","bad","dai","film","make","go","let","easi","admit","clever","nice","spirit","anim","nice","film","get","progress","hard","get","leav","stori","behind","random","shot","random","thing","happen","charact","good","conjur","jason","schwartzman","voic","mr","fox","georg","cloonei","smart","ass","son","ash","especi","engag","film","doe","quit","make","level","terribl","certainli","get","close","close","go","along","sure","anderson","get","back","track","anoth","amaz","film","decid","make","anoth","film","sorri","anderson","thi","film","big","disappoint"],"filtered2":["fantast","mr","fox","comedi","base","classic","roald","dahl","book","anderson","direct","respect","take","short","book","name","big","screen","full","length","respect","anderson","incredibli","talent","man","seem","get","lose","clever","spirit","anderson","seem","leav","stori","behind","know","talent","man","happen","bad","bad","like","go","school","bad","dai","anderson","bad","dai","make","go","let","easi","admit","clever","nice","spirit","anim","nice","get","progress","hard","get","leav","stori","behind","random","shot","random","thing","happen","charact","good","conjur","jason","schwartzman","voic","mr","fox","georg","cloonei","smart","ass","son","ash","especi","engag","doe","quit","make","level","terribl","certainli","get","close","close","go","along","sure","anderson","get","back","track","anoth","amaz","decid","make","anoth","sorri","anderson","big","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,9,10,17,18,26,29,31,35,39,45,63,73,74,82,94,102,119,120,124,127,132,143,151,166,171,187,192,221,249,262,267,272,276,277,295,296,324,332,334,336,357,389,393,428,434,437,441,445,680,685,687,691,694,744,859,867,894,943,955,1119,1339,1392,1504,1611,1651,1660,1843,4387,5203,6874],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,9,10,17,18,26,29,31,35,39,45,63,73,74,82,94,102,119,120,124,127,132,143,151,166,171,187,192,221,249,262,267,272,276,277,295,296,324,332,334,336,357,389,393,428,434,437,441,445,680,685,687,691,694,744,859,867,894,943,955,1119,1339,1392,1504,1611,1651,1660,1843,4387,5203,6874],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,3.983170235359962,2.912480743411154,4.273428342688829,1.1238870241028365,2.5541073880211935,1.2153159934048174,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,2.926338025798268,1.5538940054862738,3.632592212924433,1.8729627573220065,3.7901378413541957,3.8972672736018033,4.040393168790646,4.16224563969396,2.087553710177271,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.2323930368088845,2.4359679371086367,4.506988091575534,2.3409902041158843,5.60

{"value":"I have absolutely no knowledge of author Phillipa Pearce or any of her novels and if TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN is typical of her work I probably would have had little interest in her books as a child . When I was a child I wasn`t really interested in litreture unless it had soldiers fighting monsters complete with a high body count <br /><br />Judging by this film version of TOM`S MIDNIGHT GARDEN I guess Pearce writes for lower middle class kids since much of the story of revolves around protagonist Tom Long moving to a house with no garden then suddenly finding a metaphysical one . Having a garden of your own was no doubt something that working class people didn`t have in the 1950s so I guess there`s some political class ridden subtext there somewhere . There`s also a romance involving a young girl called Hattie but again are cynical kids amoured by love stories ? Perhaps the worst criticism is that very little in the way of excitement or adventure happens within the narrative <br /><br />This is a childrens film that seems dated by its source . It`s inoffensive but I`m surprised by its high rating by the IMDB voters .

{"value":"This is blatantly a futuristic adaptation of Jules Verne's \"Mysterious Island\". The sound editing is pretty bad. You hear the dialogue on set and you hear the voices being recorded on a recording booth at the same time! This is an amateur film with actors from Boston and shot around New Hampshire. For those living in New Engalnd and who is reading this comment will be wowed with a capital W. This film is full of flaws. You get to hear the director's voice giving directions and giving out directions to the actress. \"OK now stand up.\" As for the other characters. There is this guy who talks with his mind instead of his voice and this blue alien. The alien guy talks with a deep voice. When he is yawning or grunting when he is fighting you hear the actor's voice. As for the special effects, man! This was Brett Piper's early work for crying out loud! The creatures are good but the animation is jerky. Really jerky. Sort of like Karl Zeman animation in JOURNEY TO BEGINNING OF TIME (1955). The special effects are imaginative. Thge music is good. Bottom line, this film makes EQUINOX or PLANET OF THE DINOSAURS look like a Ray Harryhausen epic. Did you know MYSTERIOUS PLANET was a home movie and was on a shoes string budget? A must watch for aspiring film

{"value":"Despite, or perhaps in part because of the clever use of music to underscore the motivations and ideologies of each of the major characters, stereotypes are in, and verisimilitude and characterization are out in this not-too-subtle cinematic screed.<br /><br />One gets the sense that John Singleton was dabbling in post-structuralist literary theory because it was the flavor of the day, and \"Higher Learning\" was the tendentious result. The low point of the movie is the \"peace\" rally, in which the symbols of the 1960s \"free love\" movement are reappropriated for what much more closely resembles a \"Take Back The Night\" rally with live, stridently identity-conscious musical acts in tow. Perhaps in his prim revisionism the director was trying to assert that identity politics is the new Vietnam? Ooh, how Adrienne Rich of himand Remy's firing into the crowd is a nice touch, if you're into Rich's sort of political posturing.<br /><br />I wish I could give this movie negative stars. I can recommend it only to those interested in the 1990s as history, a time when radical feminists brought the academic trinity of race, class, and gender to popular culture and declared man-hating \"a viable and honorable POLITICAL option\".

{"value":"Up to this point, Gentle Rain was the movie I found the worst in history. It has been supplanted by this 'blockbuster' out of Asia. It has one \"star\" and it is John Rhys Davies. He is way out of shape to be the swashbuckling, magical flying baddie he is cast here. The rest of these people couldn't act their way out of a junior high school play. No clichés were missed in the dialogue, and the special effects were phoned in as often as possible.<br /><br />It is fairly easy to see that somebody in Asia had some bucks and needed to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money at. Or maybe it was a director or a writer that needed a credit. My guess is that any career with this movie in it's credential<br /><br />Do yourself a major favor and don't watch this movie. A hundred Thanksgivings couldn't consume this turkey.<br /><br />The one funny scene was unintentional. The brother of the King appears on the scene. The king? A handsome, older, short Asian actor. (Bad actor.) The brother? A six foot European. (Also a bad actor.) No excuses were made for this.

{"value":"When i come on IMDb boards,I'm always fed up when i see a \"the worst movie ever\" post.After watching this *movie*,i think that i am soon going to create my own post!!<br /><br />The opening titles:great,some kind of lame zoom on a gas oven (yeah,focus on the fire=explosions=great action packed movie!!)<br /><br />The actors:I think that Ice T is a cool rapper,even a nice actor (sometimes, i insist,\"sometimes\") but the Steven seagal like policeman he plays is...beyond the words. The rest of the cast is...well i don't know where those actors were hired but jeez!!I bet my dog would have been a much better actor than them!!<br /><br />The plot:Hijacking.original isn't it??<br /><br />The action sequences:The first shot of the movie is an explosion.I told myself,well, cool!!At least there will be some nice pyrotechnics...I was dead wrong.The rest of the movie is mostly

{"value":"What a waste of time and money! My hubby and I saw this movie - after seeing the previews and thinking it \"might be funny\". WRONG! This movie is about 90 minutes too long. The actors are trapped in a poorly written script and can't get out. The jokes are weak and tired, and not even seeing Wilson's naked behind can redeem any part of this film. The special effects.....aren't. I half expected to see the harness and wires holding up Uma in her flying scenes. And when the effects people apparently could not master the superhero's faster-than-a-speeding-bullet flying or fight scenes, they covered over everything with a swirling vortex of blurred screen - which hid the awful effects quite nicely. Wilson's sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and Wilson had no chemistry with either Uma or his office co-worker. The sex scenes weren't sexy and the funny scenes weren't funny. I guess I just expected too much from these actors. None of the characters were really sympathetic, so I ended up not caring a flying fig about any of them. The only memorable performances were the kids who played Bedlam and G-Girl as teenagers - at least THEY had some chemistry.

{"value":"Well. Astronaut Steve West sits in a plastic space capsule, commenting that \"you haven't lived until you've seen the sun through the rings of Saturn\", all the while the obvious mid-day sunlight is streaming through the window, when suddenly he has a nose bleed. Next, West is back home in some secret hospital, a melting gelatinous mass who goes berserk and causes a chunky nurse to run through a fake glass door. Apparently, West \"gets stronger as he melts\", which makes about as much sense as anything in this hopelessly purile, adle-brained moovie. Then this dopey \"Army Brass\", who looks kind of like Coleman Francis (director of many bad moovies) tries to cover the info up, but goo man runs around killing everyone he sees because he is melting. He attacks a bickering old couple because he is melting. He makes one terrible actress scream and moan helplessly for about 10 minutes because he is melting. He is melting because he is melting. The fx by the slumming Rick Baker are supposed to be the star here, but they just look hokey. The film is poorly shot and everything looks so dark and muddled that it's very difficult making out what's what - not that it would help any.

{"value":"METAMORPHOSIS I am working my way through the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and METAMORPHOSIS is the seventh movie in the set. Released in 1990, METAMORPHOSIS seems to be a remake of \"The Atom Age Vampire,\" which also featured a scientist striving for similar results. Set in modern times, METAMORPHSIS is not my kind of horror movie.<br /><br />A university researcher is working to crack the human genome in order to create a serum that would prevent aging. Pressured by the administration to publish his papers; and, produce some results (or risk losing funding), the scientist decides to use himself as a guinea pig! At first thinking that he suffered no adverse side effects, he eventually discovers that the serum has indeed altered him in the most unexpected manner! <br /><br />The acting is stilted; and, the performances left me with a much diminished interest in the film. The score is pandering. And, the science behind the experiments and their findings is not only fallacious; it's absurd; it's ridiculous  at best. <br /><br />As others noted, the end turns into a 30+ minute gag, which is seemingly endless.

{"value":"Prior to this film, I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore (1981), famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man-child Peter Bark, and the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer. Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema, but both were entertaining in their own special way (and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn't hurt). Massacre, however, is dull, dull, dull, despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh.<br /><br />The story, about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot, is confusing and oh-so boring: when the blood isn't flowing and the skin isn't on show, the film is a real struggle to sit through (it took me four attempts to finish), with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note.<br /><br />The only point of interest about the film is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega-gory movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you've already seen that film, then there is very little reason to bother with

Edward Furlong, you're not as good as you think mate, you can't grab on every piece of low-cost amateur crap, which sole intention has to be to get some bucks.<br /><br />The filming is bad, and I mean BAD. Anyone with a camera would get the same result, or better.<br /><br />The acting, lets just say: don't go to the supermarket looking for actors. The good ones usually come with a degree or, at least, have some damn experience! The director.. Mr. Jon Keeyes, please find your purpose in life, as a director you simply suck. Your directing is poor, the angles are all messed up (not in a good way), the lines seem as if they're being read out of toilet paper, and the damn music.. it always comes up when it shouldn't and goes out for no apparent reason. And don't go for writer either, by the way. Making movies isn't like serving on a coffeshop, it requires art and skill, things I really doubt you'll ever have.<br /><br />Instead of making a badass shootout movie, you should've shot this one back to oblivion and wait 'till something good came up..

{"value":"Previous comment made me write this. It says that Muslims are blonde and Serbs are dark (because our blood is mixed). This comment just says that this opinion can be made by racist.Look,race is nothing.I'm color blind.I look like Pierce Brosnan but I'm no Irish. So what?I might add that I am not 100% Serb,that I have some Austrian and Croat blood within me but whats the point.I'm dark, half-breed?Is that so? Anyone using racial prejudices with such bad intent like Lantos(producer9and director is racist for me.Karadzhic, Izetbegovich, Milosevic, Tudjman they are all monsters and I blame them for destroying my life, my family, my country, Yuggoslavia. Hope they will be all in hell but that wont return our dead relatives back. I am proud of being Serb and I am proud of my cousins, Austrians,Croats,Muslims, Hungarians, Arabs (yes I am from Serbia and I have multiethnical family).This movie doesn't show sufferings of Serbs or

{"value":"I couldn't tell if \"The Screaming Skull\" was trying to be a Hitchcock rip off or a modernized Edgar Allen Poe tribute. These days, someone would have chopped it up a bit and presented it as one of those TV anthology episodes from the old \"Tales From The Dark Side\"...but only after an extensive rewrite.<br /><br />The sad thing is, there seems to be a nice, nasty little story trying to get out from under the rubble of this movie, and the actors are obviously doing the best they can with both their talent and the material they have to work with. But the director just didn't know how to stage or pace a dramatic scene; the special effects simply didn't work; the screenplay telegraphed its threadbare plot points so plainly that a bivalve could have seen them coming; and the soundtrack kept playing German \"oompah band\" music when it was supposed to be trying to scare the audience. <br /><br />They tried; they tried really hard. But this is of interest only as a period piece.I suppose someone very young who hadn't seen a lot of suspense or horror might get a charge out \"The Screaming Skull\", but someone that young probably wouldn't get most of the subtext or plot motivation.

{"value":"Even though there's a repertoire of over 180 films to choose from, this 'Succubus' is often named as THE best Jess Franco film. Heck, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang counts 'Succubus' among his personal favorites. So, maybe it's me but I thought this was a dreadfully boring and overly confusing movie. The opening is great, though, and shows Janine Reynaud performing an SM act on stage. It's all downhill from here, unfortunately. Reynaud's character is a maneater who eventually kills her lovers in some sort of trance. Franco had a decent budget to work with and spends it well on nice locations, beautiful photography and a mesmerizing musical score. This COULD have been his greatest film indeed, if it wasn't for the lame and uninteresting story. It's supposed to be psychedelic but I'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what's shown here. Half of the time, you don't have a clue what's going on or what exactly is said so even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to last ages. This most certainly isn't Franco's best film according to me. I wouldn't even recommend it to die-hard exploitation fans.

{"value":"I found this movie in the 'horror' section of my video store. That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there. From Romero's 'Dead' trilogy to '28 days later.' However upon watching it, you can quickly see what this movie really is.<br /><br />It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory. There is no horror here folks. Just some half-way decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last... and last... and last... and soon you get the feeling maybe you're DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes, but no, this is how they actually made the movie. It's a pity. I think anyone could find a better use for $7 million dollars in the movie industry than make this lump o' crud. Though some of the 360 effects were cool, but once again, they were over used and grew tedious since it was the same stunt over and over again each time, just with a different character.<br /><br />Also what is ROYALLY annoying is the splicing on of footage from the arcade game. I've played the game. It sucks. So why did they put it in here? Oh that's right, this isn't a movie but a music video, and it's a poor one at that. 3/10<br /><br />Rated R: a lot of violence/gore, and

{"value":"This film had a great cast going for it: Christopher Lee, Dean Jagger, Macdonald Carey, Lew Ayres -- solid b-movie actors all. But this downer of a movie didn't use any of them to any sort of advantage, with none of their characters even meeting on screen (though Christopher Lee does get to play opposite himself in several scenes).<br /><br />The motivations for the aliens in this movie seem to change at the drop of a hat. First, they just want to repair their ship and leave, then they turn on the main character by killing most of his friends and not releasing his wife after he gets them the crucial part they need. Then, out of nowhere, this \"peaceful\" race decides they have to destroy the planet because it causes too many \"diseases\" (though they do offer the main character and his wife a spot in their society).<br /><br />Most of the film is spent watching the man and wife drive or walk or stand around or sit at desks doing nothing. You almost wish they had gotten taken out with the rest of the planet at the end, just in vengeance for boring us to death.<br /><br />Unless you really like Chris Lee or seventies low-budget sci-fi, I'd give this one a miss.

{"value":"What was with all the Turkish actors? No offense but I thought it was all for nothing for all these actors. The film had no script to test any actors acting skill or ability. It demanded next to nothing I bought this film to see Michael Madsen. He is one of my favorite actors but this film was another failure for him. The script was so bad. Their was just nothing to sink your teeth into and all the characters were two dimensional. Madsen tried to act like a hard ass but the script and direction didn't even allow him to do enough with his character to make it more interesting or 3 dimensional.<br /><br />Even the sound effects of the gunfight at the beginning of the film sounded like the noise of paint ball guns when they are fired in a skirmish. It was really weird and they didn't sound like real guns. A video game had better sound effects than this film. There was also a really annoying bloke at the beginning of the film who was a member of the robbery gang. He had this American whining voice like a girl shouting lines like \"Lets get the F#$k out of here\" and What are we going to do man\". He sounded like a girl.

{"value":"This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well, then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects. For example, in the original, one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening in terror to the noises outside their room. Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her. Nell then looks across at Theo, who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand. In the latest version, Nell is lying alone in bed, when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor. It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened. And can anybody explain what Nell's final words mean - \"It's about family. It's always been about family\"?<br /><br />The one redeeming feature is Lili Taylor's performance, but even this cannot save the film. Catherine Zeta-Jones demonstrates once again that, beneath her pretty exterior, there is little depth. In the original, Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion.

{"value":"I had to walk out of the theater. After an hour, all I was seeing was people cheating on wives, schtupping like dogs in a rut, and using the f-word like a diabetic using Equal.<br /><br />No thanks.<br /><br />It was especially frustrating because the movie could have done a lot. Any one of the characters could have been quite interesting if they were given more to do than fornicate, talk about it, and swear at each other.<br /><br />The few times that it looked as if there were about to be some sort of character development, all that happened was another sex scene. Plot development in the 1st hour can be summarized as 1)several murders occur, 2) Vinnie sees murder scene 3) Vinnie stares moodily across Atlantic/East/Hudson River 4) Vinnie cheats on wife, and 5) Joey (most sympathetic character in the show) gets kicked out of his parents' house. More than that, I didn't wait to see.<br /><br />The photography and the interplay between the characters were superb, but THERE WAS NOTHING for them to DO. The flood of sex and vulgarity was hardly worth waiting another hour for SOMETHING to happen.<br /><br />Sorry, Spike. Take some lessons from Notting Hill, or Shawshank Redemption.

{"value":"i usually don't write reviews but i can't understand why this is rated so high and wanted to give a warning to horror lovers since i can only assume that all those high ratings were given by average TV watchers.<br /><br />i have only watched the first two episodes but those two were so cliché, it wasn't even funny any more. the same old stories you've probably seen/read a couple of times already - living toys, evil things from other dimensions... and it's not just that these stories aren't innovative, they are also pretty bad versions of those clichés. i'd prefer e.g. \"chucky\" and \"silent hill\" over those two episodes anytime. and don't even ask about the visual effects... the ones in the first episode are alright but the ones in the second... awful. looks like some film student's project gone wrong. blood... or gore... erm... nothing worth mentioning.<br /><br />it might be interesting for some ten year old kid who probably hasn't seen/read that many scary stories yet (although i'd rather recommend \"beyond belief\" - now that's what i call a decent mystery TV show). but for an adult horror fan this is worthless. i only gave the 3 points because there is in

{"value":"Writer/Director Peter Greenaway cements his title as the High Lord of Art House Pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self-indulgence, 8 ½ Women. The film follows a wealthy Englishman and his son on their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction, as they lure and blackmail women (guess how many) into joining their personal collection of concubines.<br /><br />Think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive, and chances are Greenaway's done it. The female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of. There's the Kabuki-obsessed Mio, the ever-pregnant Giaconda and Beryl, who's got a thing for farm animals. Giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair, she's the \"half woman,\" get it? Greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny, but if this isn't it, then what is?<br /><br />The film goes on to eroticize anything and everything having to do with Japan, a continuation of themes from his snore-worthy (but less sexist) 1996 film, The Pillow Book. But where the The Pillow Book was erotic and graceful, 8 ½ Women just gets horny and exploitative. Greenaway's work is tasteless and arrogant in its fetishism, and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the auteur

{"value":"That's pretty ridiculous, I hope many people are exposed to Muslims who live all over the U.S, U.k, and all over the world. The religion has over a billion followers. I Myself born and bread in America and through my religious classes and teachings I have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society. I am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world. I have know many Muslims from all over and I have traveled to countries like Pakistan..I have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media...I wonder why... Also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion. Its a religion of one billion people, and these are less than one percent, I am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the KKK, IRA and many more which are simple

{"value":"Pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult, who fights them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists, who during a raid by the police is hidden away, and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town. It's hard to keep track of who characters are, or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place. The leader gets paroled sixteen years later (I got that from the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie). Nobody is made to look any older, not noticeably, anyway.<br /><br />One murder is done with a large circular logging saw, others are done with knives or a crossbow. I never heard the title character's name mentioned in the movie, but he's the one who overacts the most, hooting and hollering.<br /><br />The movie is patched together pretty poorly, with voice-over helping (not much) to explain what is going on. Some of the sound effects were pretty bad. A man is getting punched, and we hear the sound of a whip cracking. A woman fires a gun, and we don't hear it fire, but hear a ricochet instead!

{"value":"**Possible Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br />\tJason (a.k.a. Herb) Evers is a brilliant brain surgeon who, along with wife Virginia Leith, is involved in the most lackluster onscreen car crash ever. Leith is decapitated and the doctor takes her severed noggin back to his mansion and rejuvenates the head in his lab. The mansion's exterior was allegedly filmed at Tarrytown's Lyndhurst estate; the lab scenes were apparently shot in somebody's basement. The bandaged head is kept alive on \"lab equipment\" that's almost cheap-looking enough for Ed Wood. Some of the library musicthe movie's high pointlater turned up in Andy Milligan's THE BODY BENEATH. Leith's head has some heavy metaphysical discourses with another of Ever's misfires, a mutant chained in the closet. Meanwhile, the good doc prowls strip joints looking for a body worthy of his wife's gabby noodle. The ending, in uncut prints, features some ahead-of-its-time splatter and dismemberment when the zucchini-headed monster comes out of the closet to bring the movie to a welcome close. This thing took three years to be released and then, audiences gave it the bad reception it richly deserved.

{"value":"Rajkumar Santoshi Without Any Doubt Has Directed The Greatest Movies And Biggest Box Office Hits Of Indian Cinema.<br /><br />This Movie Falls Short Of All Expectations As This Movie Stars Two Great Actors Mr. Amitabh Bachchan And Akshay Kumar And When You Have These Two Actors In The Same Movie You Have To Make A Magnum Opus.<br /><br />In The Later Part Of The Movie You Can Make Out That Amitabh Bachchan's Voice Has Been Dubbed By Some Other Person Which Was Due To His Illness.<br /><br />Still The Movie Did'nt Had Proper Character Development Plus Cinematography Was'nt Good Too And One Thing That Bollywood Should Learn Is That They Should Use Visual Effects Only When It Is Needed And When Applied Should Be Done With A High Budget.The Script Had So Many Flaws Which Gives The Viewer Excuses To Attend His Phone Calls Rather Than Watching The Movie.<br /><br />The New Comer Shakes The Leg Well But Could Not Act Well But Where The Movie Loses Big Time Is The Storyline

{"value":"It's hard to believe that in 1997 David Duchovny was at the top of his fame, with X-Files, one of the best sci-fi series ever, being at the top of the glory. Nine years later he is almost forgotten, and his tentatives to make it on the big screen failed miserably. I cannot even explain why, he is a fair actor, but probably his moment of fame cast him in a eternal role that takes big talent to break from.<br /><br />At the same time Angelina Jolie was much less known, and she was really lucky that a film like 'Playing God' did not led her career into a dead-end. Fortunately for her, 'The Bone Collector' and 'Girl, Interrupted' were waiting beyond the corner, and when Lara Croft came, her career was launched.<br /><br />There is not too much to be told about this film. It's the only big screen film of Andy Wilson, and there must be a reason. All is banal and most of what happens on the screen expected in this story of an ex-doctor who saves the life of a shooting victim in a bar only to find himself working for the mob. The off-screen voice is especially bad, with a moralistic text that kills any shade of cinematographic experience from the film. You probably will not meet the film but in DVD rental stores, or on TV.

{"value":"I'll admit I've only watched a handful of episodes, but each one seemed completely different from the next. It seems after the first season, the producers decided to completely retool the show, drop characters, introduce new ones, and rewrite the entire show dynamic.<br /><br />As you have probably surmised already, the show is about quirky, unpredictable teenager Holly (Amanda Bynes) who moves in with her high strung sister Valerie (Jennie Garth) in New York City. Decent enough premise: odd couple + fish out of water + high jinx.<br /><br />While I miss the sitcoms of yore, this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly, and it's sad because they have some decent talent.<br /><br />On top of everything, they insisted on changing the show (Val was living with a cast regular bf one season, then he was suddenly gone, so she opens a bakery? what?) When things change that drastically, you get the feeling that even the *show* knows it's bad. I mean, completely new sets, characters written off and new show regulars!<br /><br />On a side note (this is just nitpicking), I know this is a television show and not real at all, but Val and Holly end up living in a HUGE loft duplex (there are stairs) with a terrace... in MANHATTAN!

{"value":"The title says it all. \"Tail Gunner Joe\" was a tag given to the Senator which relied upon the ignorance of the public about World War II aircraft. The rear facing moving guns relied upon a latch that would prevent the rear gunner from shooting off the tail of the airplane by preventing the gun from firing when it pointed at the tail. When the Senator was practicing on the ground one day, he succeeded in shooting off the tail of the airplane. He couldn't have done that if the gun had been properly aligned. The gunnery officer responsible for that admitted, in public, before a camera, that he was responsible -- he had made the error, not the Senator. The fact that the film did not report that fact, shows how one-sided it is. This film was designed to do one thing, destroy the reputation of a complex person.<br /><br />A much better program was the PBS special done on him. He was a hard working, intelligent, ambitious politician who overcame extraordinary disadvantages to rise to extraordinary heights. He made some mistakes, some serious mistakes, but shooting the tail off an airplane was not one of them.<br /><br />The popularity of this film is due to the fact that the public likes simple stories, one=sided stories, so that they don't have to
