{"value":"This movie is the perfect illustration of how NOT to make a sci fi movie. The worst tendency in sci-fi is to make your theme an awful, sophomoric, pseudo-Orwellian/Huxleyan/whateverian \"vision\" of \"the human future.\"<br /><br />Science fiction filmmakers (and authors), as geeks, take themselves very seriously given the high crap-to-good-stuff ratio of their genre. I think other genres with a high CTGSR (yes, I just made it up, relax), like horror or action or even romantic comedy, seem to have a little better grasp of the fact that they are not changing the world with some profound \"message.\"<br /><br />Sci fi can certainly be successful on a serious level, as numerous great filmmakers have proven. But there is an immense downside to the whole concept, which is represented by \"Robot Jox,\" with its low-rent construction of \"the future\" (lone good design element: the bizarre, slick-looking billboard ads all over the place that encourage women to have more babies) and its painfully heavy-handed \"Iliad\" parallels (He's NAMED ACHILLES FOR GOD'S SAKE! I actually didn't pick up on this until I saw the film for like the tenth time, but I went to public school, so the filmmakers are not exonerated.)<br /><br />Of course, if you're a crazy movie freak like me, this downside has a great upside. I absolutely LOVE movies like this, because bad movies are quite often more fun and sometimes even more interesting than good ones. It's kind of a Lester Bangs approach to movie viewing, I guess.<br /><br />Note: The lead in this movie (Gary Graham? Is that his name? I refuse to go check.) is really not that bad. He makes a go of it. He's kind of cool, especially when he's drunk/hung over.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","the","perfect","illustr","of","how","not","to","make","a","sci","fi","movi","the","wrong","tendenc","in","scifi","be","to","make","your","theme","a","aw","sophomor","pseudoorwellianhuxleyanwhateverian","vision","of","the","human","futurebr","br","scienc","fiction","filmmak","and","author","a","geek","take","themselv","veri","serious","give","the","high","craptogoodstuff","ratio","of","their","genr","i","think","other","genr","with","a","high","ctgsr","ye","i","just","make","it","up","relax","like","horror","or","action","or","even","romant","comedi","seem","to","have","a","littl","well","grasp","of","the","fact","that","thei","be","not","chang","the","world","with","some","profound","messagebr","br","sci","fi","can","certainli","be","success","on","a","seriou","level","a","numer","great","filmmak","have","prove","but","there","be","a","immens","downsid","to","the","whole","concept","which","be","repres","by","robot","jox","with","it","lowrent","construct","of","the","futur","lone","good","design","elem","the","bizarr","slicklook","billboard","ad","all","over","the","place","that","encourag","woman","to","have","much","babi","and","it","painfulli","heavyhand","iliad","parallel","he","name","achil","for","god","sake","i","actual","do","not","pick","up","on","thi","until","i","see","the","film","for","like","the","time","but","i","go","to","public","school","so","the","filmmak","be","not","exoneratedbr","br","of","cours","if","you","re","a","crazi","movi","freak","like","me","thi","downsid","have","a","great","upsid","i","absolut","love","movi","like","thi","becaus","bad","movi","be","quit","often","much","fun","and","sometim","even","much","interest","than","good","on","it","kind","of","a","lester","bang","approach","to","movi","view","i","guessbr","br","note","the","lead","in","thi","movi","gari","graham","be","that","hi","name","i","refus","to","go","check","be","realli","not","that","bad","he","make","a","go","of","it","he","kind","of","cool","especi","when","he","drunkhung","over"],"filtered":["thi","movi","perfect","illustr","make","sci","fi","movi","wrong","tendenc","scifi","make","theme","aw","sophomor","pseudoorwellianhuxleyanwhateverian","vision","human","futurebr","br","scienc","fiction","filmmak","author","geek","take","themselv","veri","serious","give","high","craptogoodstuff","ratio","genr","think","genr","high","ctgsr","ye","make","relax","like","horror","action","even","romant","comedi","seem","littl","well","grasp","fact","thei","chang","world","profound","messagebr","br","sci","fi","certainli","success","seriou","level","numer","great","filmmak","prove","immens","downsid","whole","concept","repres","robot","jox","lowrent","construct","futur","lone","good","design","elem","bizarr","slicklook","billboard","ad","place","encourag","woman","much","babi","painfulli","heavyhand","iliad","parallel","name","achil","god","sake","actual","pick","thi","see","film","like","time","go","public","school","filmmak","exoneratedbr","br","cours","re","crazi","movi","freak","like","thi","downsid","great","upsid","absolut","love","movi","like","thi","becaus","bad","movi","quit","often","much","fun","sometim","even","much","interest","good","kind","lester","bang","approach","movi","view","guessbr","br","note","lead","thi","movi","gari","graham","hi","name","refus","go","check","realli","bad","make","go","kind","cool","especi","drunkhung"],"filtered2":["perfect","illustr","make","sci","fi","wrong","tendenc","scifi","make","theme","aw","sophomor","pseudoorwellianhuxleyanwhateverian","vision","human","futurebr","scienc","fiction","filmmak","author","geek","take","themselv","veri","serious","give","high","craptogoodstuff","ratio","genr","think","genr","high","ctgsr","ye","make","relax","like","horror","action","even","romant","comedi","seem","littl","well","grasp","fact","chang","world","profound","messagebr","sci","fi","certainli","success","seriou","level","numer","great","filmmak","prove","immens","downsid","whole","concept","repres","robot","jox","lowrent","construct","futur","lone","good","design","elem","bizarr","slicklook","billboard","ad","place","encourag","woman","babi","painfulli","heavyhand","iliad","parallel","name","achil","god","sake","actual","pick","see","like","time","go","public","school","filmmak","exoneratedbr","cours","re","crazi","freak","like","downsid","great","upsid","absolut","love","like","becaus","bad","quit","often","fun","sometim","even","interest","good","kind","lester","bang","approach","view","guessbr","note","lead","gari","graham","name","refus","go","check","realli","bad","make","go","kind","cool","especi","drunkhung"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,6,8,9,12,13,14,15,20,22,25,30,31,35,51,52,54,60,68,70,83,97,111,120,122,127,129,138,143,157,164,165,199,209,211,222,259,267,278,292,296,312,323,352,371,389,400,436,445,446,467,479,481,493,500,504,532,533,540,560,677,681,698,712,726,780,781,825,844,864,910,916,1079,1112,1152

{"value":"To say this film stinks would be insulting to skunks. As the other commenter says, this movie is insulting to anyone over the mental age of 7 (it is especially, incredibly insulting to gays). It is awful - and not in a \"so bad it's funny\" sort of way either - it's just plain awful. No, I have to say it: IT STINKS! (sorry skunks).<br /><br />From the opening credits to the end titles there is hardly more than 10 seconds of this movie worth opening your eyes for. The \"plot\" is incoherent, the characterization non-existent, the acting is of the over the top mugging \"look at me I'm being funny!\" school and so it goes on. The set pieces are clumsily set up (if at all) and are badly executed, it's just awful on every front - apart from the music maybe, I don't remember thinking the music stinks (apart from the songs).<br /><br />To be fair to the makers, they lay their cards on the table pretty quickly: the opening credits include the title \"Also starring Ertha Kitt as the voice of Betty the meteor\" (since as the meteor in question turns out never never say anything but make an occasional purring noise they may well have lifted Ms. Kitt's contribution from one of her records) and the second line of the movie runs something like: \"...and scientists have discovered new facts about the rings around Uranus.\" Uranus - \"Your Anus\" geddit? geddit? huh? huh?? Your Anus? The humour really is that cheap.<br /><br />It says strange things about the \"comedies\" of that period in that it was perfectly permissable for the hero to deliberately shoot people dead in the street but not say \"sh*t\" out loud.<br /><br />I paid fifty pence (about $1.00) for this movie in a sale. I feel ripped off.","finished_norm":["to","sai","thi","film","stink","would","be","insult","to","skunk","a","the","other","comment","sai","thi","movi","be","insult","to","anyon","over","the","mental","ag","of","it","be","especi","incredibli","insult","to","gai","it","be","aw","and","not","in","a","so","bad","it","funni","sort","of","wai","either","it","just","plain","aw","no","i","have","to","sai","it","it","stink","sorri","skunksbr","br","from","the","open","credit","to","the","end","titl","there","be","hardli","much","than","second","of","thi","movi","worth","open","your","ey","for","the","plot","be","incoher","the","character","nonexist","the","act","be","of","the","over","the","top","mug","look","at","me","i","be","be","funni","school","and","so","it","go","on","the","set","piec","be","clumsili","set","up","if","at","all","and","be","badli","execut","it","just","aw","on","everi","front","apart","from","the","music","mayb","i","do","not","rememb","think","the","music","stink","apart","from","the","songsbr","br","to","be","fair","to","the","maker","thei","lie","their","card","on","the","tabl","pretti","quickli","the","open","credit","includ","the","titl","conjur","star","ertha","kitt","a","the","voic","of","betti","the","meteor","sinc","a","the","meteor","in","question","turn","out","never","never","sai","anyth","but","make","a","occasion","purr","nois","thei","mai","good","have","lift","m","kitt","contribut","from","on","of","her","record","and","the","line","of","the","movi","run","someth","like","and","scientist","have","discov","new","fact","about","the","ring","around","uranu","uranu","your","anu","geddit","geddit","huh","huh","your","anu","the","humour","realli","be","that","cheapbr","br","it","sai","strang","thing","about","the","comedi","of","that","period","in","that","it","be","perfectli","permiss","for","the","hero","to","deliber","shoot","peopl","dead","in","the","street","but","not","sai","sht","out","loudbr","br","i","pai","fifti","penni","about","for","thi","movi","in","a","sale","i","feel","rip","off"],"filtered":["sai","thi","film","stink","insult","skunk","comment","sai","thi","movi","insult","anyon","mental","ag","especi","incredibli","insult","gai","aw","bad","funni","sort","wai","either","plain","aw","sai","stink","sorri","skunksbr","br","open","credit","end","titl","hardli","much","second","thi","movi","worth","open","ey","plot","incoher","character","nonexist","act","top","mug","look","funni","school","go","set","piec","clumsili","set","badli","execut","aw","everi","front","apart","music","mayb","rememb","think","music","stink","apart","songsbr","br","fair","maker","thei","lie","card","tabl","pretti","quickli","open","credit","includ","titl","conjur","star","ertha","kitt","voic","betti","meteor","sinc","meteor","question","turn","never","never","sai","anyth","make","occasion","purr","nois","thei","mai","good","lift","m","kitt","contribut","record","line","movi","run","someth","like","scientist","discov","new","fact","ring","around","uranu","uranu","anu","geddit","geddit","huh","huh","anu","humour","realli","cheapbr","br","sai","strang","thing","comedi","period","perfectli","permiss","hero","deliber","shoot","peopl","dead","street","sai","sht","loudbr","br","pai","fifti","penni","thi","movi","sale","feel","rip"],"filtered2":["stink","insult","skunk","comment","insult","anyon","mental","ag","especi","incredibli","insult","gai","aw","bad","funni","sort","wai","either","plain","aw","stink","sorri","skunksbr","open","credit","end","titl","hardli","second","worth","open","ey","plot","incoher","character","nonexist","act","top","mug","look","funni","school","go","set","piec","clumsili","set","badli","execut","aw","everi","front","apart","music","mayb","rememb","think","music","stink","apart","songsbr","fair","maker","lie","card","tabl","pretti","quickli","open","credit","includ","titl","conjur","star","ertha","kitt","voic","betti","meteor","sinc","meteor","question","turn","never","never","anyth","make","occasion","purr","nois","mai","good","lift","m","kitt","contribut","record","line","run","someth","like","scientist","discov","new","fact","ring","around","uranu","uranu","anu","geddit","geddit","huh","huh","anu","humour","realli","cheapbr","strang","thing","comedi","period","perfectli","permiss","hero","deliber","shoot","peopl","dead","street","sht","loudbr","pai","fifti","penni","sale","feel","rip"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,9,12,13,16,21,23,24,29,32,33,39,42,43,46,53,62,78,85,87,96,97,98,100,104,107,109,117,118,127,137,138,158,162,163,207,218,219,228,242,264,267,269,280,281,290,296,301,322,356,364,375,378,417,428,437,442,448,572,586,640,650,662,664,665,687,709,743,762,771,773,782,805,824,877,911,947,1020,1084,1099,1221,1243,1408,1475,1484,1499,1537,1576,1875,1895,2002,2037,2134,2497,2676,3068,3074,3084,4193,4259,4834,5707,6440],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0

{"value":"Because some people, like me, like to know EVERYTHING about a movie even if they plan to see it, including the ending. Anyway, here's the ending as I remember it, because I couldn't have been more than 8 yrs old when I saw it for the first and only time on TV. But I'll tell ya, it sure scared the little kid that I was, and I thought about it for days afterward, and it still stands out in my mind to this day, even though some of the details are a little vague. Abe Vigoda was in this movie? I don't remember that! I didn't even remember that ol' Barnabus was in this movie, and I LOVED Dark Shadows. So, at the end, the lead character (Belinda Montgomery?) is lured by the Judge (Joseph Cotton, I'm guessing, even though I remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge; see how memory fades?) to the wedding place, which as I remember it is in a cavern of some kind? Maybe I've got that wrong; and Shelley Winters is there laughing, and the Judge has a cape on, and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him, and he throws back the cloak, and he has goat legs, and he announces he's actually her father, the Devil, and she's played right into their (the satanic cult's) hands, because the \"mortal\" guy she has fallen in love with (I guess that's Robert Foxworth) turns out also to be the guy Satan wants to marry her off to, The Demon with Yellow Eyes, and yep, sure enough, they show Robert Foxworth, and his eyes glow yellow. There are a lot of close-ups in the last few minutes of the film. Everyone is laughing and rejoicing, except for Belinda Montgomery, who is very unhappy, and cries or screams or something, and that's the end.

{"value":"What ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time? Well, he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could've been directed by anybody available out of film school...and in fact, they probably would've done a better job. They would've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes. (gasp!) Except this time around, the apes squirm through groan-worthy dialogue, nonsensical plotting, and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe.<br /><br />As much as I enjoy the superb acting talent that is Tim Roth, his performance as evil ape leader Thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing. Luckily for him, the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap-dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles.<br /><br />And alas, the always dependable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause. And the \"haha, we're so clever, aren't we?\" way that Hollywood intermingles references from the original POTA into this one. Sigh...<br /><br />Instead of seeing this, spend the night in and call up some friends and rent 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Batman', or even to a lesser extent 'Sleepy Hollow', and reminisce about the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality...not shame and ridicule.","finished_norm":["what","ever","happen","to","on","of","the","much","innov","and","brilliant","storytel","of","our","time","good","he","make","the","kind","of","typic","summer","action","fodder","that","can","have","be","direct","by","anybodi","avail","out","of","film","schooland","in","fact","thei","probabl","would","have","do","a","well","job","thei","would","have","at","littl","have","put","half","of","a","think","into","the","dread","scriptbr","br","mark","wahlberg","plai","a","astronaut","who","travel","through","some","sort","of","wormhol","and","land","in","a","planet","rule","by","ap","gasp","except","thi","time","around","the","ap","squirm","through","groanworthi","dialogu","nonsens","plot","and","showi","special","effect","that","constantli","reinforc","in","my","mind","that","thi","monei","can","have","be","put","to","about","independ","film","that","would","have","be","consid","masterpiec","next","to","thi","tripebr","br","a","much","a","i","enjoi","the","superb","act","talent","that","be","tim","roth","hi","perform","a","evil","ap","leader","thade","be","noth","much","than","a","intens","composit","of","slouch","and","heavi","breath","luckili","for","him","the","makeup","allow","he","a","a","actor","to","maintain","some","digniti","and","much","of","the","crapdialogu","be","hide","behind","hi","groan","and","snifflesbr","br","and","ala","the","alwai","depend","hollywood","tradit","of","take","the","male","and","femal","lead","and","hook","them","up","at","the","end","without","ani","relationship","develop","or","caus","and","the","haha","we","re","so","clever","be","not","we","wai","that","hollywood","intermingl","refer","from","the","origin","pota","into","thi","on","sighbr","br","instead","of","see","thi","spend","the","night","in","and","call","up","some","friend","and","rend","ed","wood","edward","scissorhand","batman","or","even","to","a","lesser","extent","sleepi","hollow","and","reminisc","about","the","dai","when","tim","burton","be","a","man","of","vision","and","originalitynot","shame","and","ridicul"],"filtered":["ever","happen","much","innov","brilliant","storytel","time","good","make","kind","typic","summer","action","fodder","direct","anybodi","avail","film","schooland","fact","thei","probabl","well","job","thei","littl","put","half","think","dread","scriptbr","br","mark","wahlberg","plai","astronaut","travel","sort","wormhol","land","planet","rule","ap","gasp","except","thi","time","around","ap","squirm","groanworthi","dialogu","nonsens","plot","showi","special","effect","constantli","reinforc","mind","thi","monei","put","independ","film","consid","masterpiec","next","thi","tripebr","br","much","enjoi","superb","act","talent","tim","roth","hi","perform","evil","ap","leader","thade","noth","much","intens","composit","slouch","heavi","breath","luckili","makeup","allow","actor","maintain","digniti","much","crapdialogu","hide","behind","hi","groan","snifflesbr","br","ala","alwai","depend","hollywood","tradit","take","male","femal","lead","hook","end","without","ani","relationship","develop","caus","haha","re","clever","wai","hollywood","intermingl","refer","origin","pota","thi","sighbr","br","instead","see","thi","spend","night","call","friend","rend","ed","wood","edward","scissorhand","batman","even","lesser","extent","sleepi","hollow","reminisc","dai","tim","burton","man","vision","originalitynot","shame","ridicul"],"filtered2":["ever","happen","innov","brilliant","storytel","time","good","make","kind","typic","summer","action","fodder","direct","anybodi","avail","schooland","fact","probabl","well","job","littl","put","half","think","dread","scriptbr","mark","wahlberg","plai","astronaut","travel","sort","wormhol","land","planet","rule","ap","gasp","except","time","around","ap","squirm","groanworthi","dialogu","nonsens","plot","showi","special","effect","constantli","reinforc","mind","monei","put","independ","consid","masterpiec","next","tripebr","enjoi","superb","act","talent","tim","roth","perform","evil","ap","leader","thade","noth","intens","composit","slouch","heavi","breath","luckili","makeup","allow","actor","maintain","digniti","crapdialogu","hide","behind","groan","snifflesbr","ala","alwai","depend","hollywood","tradit","take","male","femal","lead","hook","end","without","ani","relationship","develop","caus","haha","re","clever","wai","hollywood","intermingl","refer","origin","pota","sighbr","instead","see","spend","night","call","friend","rend","ed","wood","edward","scissorhand","batman","even","lesser","extent","sleepi","hollow","reminisc","dai","tim","burton","man","vision","originalitynot","shame","ridicul"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,8,12,14,20,21,24,27,31,32,33,40,41,44,45,49,68,69,94,97,98,102,105,106,122,125,126,129,132,142,148,152,157,159,161,197,200,203,206,210,233,238,248,269,274,276,283,289,297,300,317,320,321,393,422,453,521,531,574,577,613,649,655,707,715,717,870,905,912,955,960,995,1008,1032,1086,1157,1174,1177,1209,1210,12

{"value":"I just saw this film yesterday.<br /><br />My girlfriend wanted to see it only because of Richard Gere.<br /><br />I feel I wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it's the last time we go to see a film just because a certain actor/actress is in it. I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her seat. As of me, since I paid already, I wanted to see the end at least, just in the hope something good would turn up, but I didn't hold my breath, and luckily so cause I would have been a victim of the film just the same.<br /><br />This is not a black and white film, it's a black and black one. The main character (Richard Gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all sex offenders are portrayed as unredeemable hard core criminals and the bad ones among them were really very very bad. Speak of a cliché and the exploitation of a typical US phobia.<br /><br />Richard Gere's acting was good as usual but the blond girl that's supposed to replace him was wishy washy at best. Totally unconvincing for the job.<br /><br />The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic, and sensational turn that just is unreal. They just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murders, vigilante beating, rape and torture - something that almost seems gratuitous. They even have a wolf attacking people in the film - how low can you get.<br /><br />I gather the film won't come out in the USA and will go straight to DVD. That's were it should have stayed in other countries too, but because it's Hollywood and Richard Gere they just had to show it. Believe me, without Gere, the film is not even worth a B-series

{"value":"Yet another Die Hard straight to video rip off with cardboard villains How many more of these god awful cheaply (and badly) made rip off of the more popular action movies of the late 1980's and early 1990's are there still lurking out there? For the record (not that you will care really) this one is yet another blatant rip off of a combination of Die Hard, Under Siege and Speed 2 complete with a full complement of clichés and predictability.<br /><br />The non descript villains are the usual selection of cardboard cut out gun toting thugs who are dispatched by various means as the film progresses, the hero naturally is an ex cop or something that has family and attitude problems and of course he brings along to the party not only the usual emotional baggage but also a matching piece of eye candy and his annoying son.<br /><br />The supposed luxury cruise liner that is running between Florida and Mexico is carefully described as a cross between a liner and a ferry  this goes someway to explaining how come they appear to be larking around on a rusty cross channel ferry  in New Zealand! The acting is as wooden as the deck, the script woeful, the one liners predictable, the villains utterly inept and the plot has holes in it you could sail a boat through.<br /><br />There seems to be a never ending tide of this sort of rip off straight to video rubbish polluting the late night slots of television and the DVD bargain bins of supermarkets everywhere (although even this film is so bad it has yet to see a DVD release yet but give it time!)

{"value":"Meet Peter Houseman, rock star genetic professor at Virgina University. When he's not ballin' on the court he's blowing minds and dropping panties in his classroom lectures. Dr. Houseman is working on a serum that would allow the body to constantly regenerate cells allowing humans to become immortal. I'd want to be immortal too if I looked like Christian Bale and got the sweet female lovin that only VU can offer. An assortment of old and ugly university professors don't care for the popular Houseman and cut off funding for his project due to lack of results. This causes Peter to use himself as the guinea pig for his serum. Much to my amazement there are side effects and he, get this, metamorphoses! into something that is embedded into our genetic DNA that has been repressed for \"millions of years\". He also beds Dr. Mike's crush Sally after a whole day of knowing her. She has a son. His name is Tommy. He is an angry little boy.<br /><br />Metamorphosis isn't a terrible movie, just not a well produced one. The whole time I watched this I couldn't get past the fact that this was filmed in 1989. The look and feel of the movie is late seventies quality at the latest. It does not help that it's packaged along with 1970's movies as Metamorphosis is part of mill creek entertainment's 50 chilling classics. There is basically no film quality difference whatsoever. The final five minutes are pure bad movie cheese that actually, for me at least, save the movie from a lower rating. Pay attention to the computer terminology such as \"cromosonic anomaly\".

{"value":"I'm not a big fan of slasher flicks as a genre, but even by the standards of low-low-budget exploitation, this one is really lame. Even on a nudity-and-gore level, it's incredibly boring (there is some of both, but it's all sort of...meh). Before the home video revolution, it might not even have been released theatrically (though it might have; after all, *Plan 9 From Outer Space* played in theaters). There is precisely one good (and competently-delivered) line in the entire movie; I assume they stole it from somewhere.<br /><br />The acting is among the worst I have ever seen. I mean, even Ed Wood had a couple of competent actors, and the rest tended to be ludicrously hammy, which can be fun to watch. Anyway, most of his actors could pretty much pass as literate. Here, those who don't read their lines like cigar-store Indians sound like they learned them phonetically. And this film does have one distinction: it manages to be badly underplotted for most of the movie, then laughably overplotted for the ending.<br /><br />(Update: I should have singled out the actress playing the receptionist as an exception. She is by no means wooden. Not that she's good, but she certainly isn't wooden.)<br /><br />Even the worst slasher flicks are generally good for a few Puritan meditations on their grotesque offensiveness, but with this one, there doesn't even seem to be anything there to work up a moral outrage about.<br /><br />And you know the funniest thing? They clearly expected to make a sequel!<br /><br />It's so bad and boring that it actually becomes fascinating in a weird way. I sat enrapt through much of the video wondering why anyone would go to the bother of making

{"value":"This movie is lame and not funny at all. The plot doesn't even make sense. Some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit (I guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently. There is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie. I'm sure the topless girls doesn't hurt there either. The extra features on the DVD were even more confusing than the rest of the movie, I thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a bunch of things (like the other dimension and book seller) than make it confusing. I didn't like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal. I don't recommend watching it though it was just too stupid, I can't think of any part of the movie that was

{"value":"*** May contain spoilers. *** <br /><br />If LIVING ON TOKYO TIME were some bold experiment where real-life wanna-be actors were given film parts on the condition that they would be required to take a combination of powerful prescription anti-anxiety, anti-depression, and anti-psychotic medications (this is the classic psych ward combo that renders patients into drooling zombies) all during filming, then this movie would hold far more interest. Or, if the film production was another type of experiment where all of the actors were sleep deprived before and during filming, then TOKYO TIME could be more easily explained.<br /><br />As it is, this film is filled with lifeless, low-energy actors. In the scene where the new husband was sitting on the stairs talking with his sister, it appeared that he was having trouble keeping his eyes open. In almost every scene he speaks his lines sitting down with every part of his body motionless. From beginning to end, his facial expression is best described as \"near sleep.\"<br /><br />Fret not about the actors speaking over each other's lines because these actors can barely finish droning out any lines of dialog. Everyone speaks with a depressing, monotone voice. No laughing. No yelling. No vigor. No one has energy enough to crack a smile. The result: complete and total boredom.<br /><br />And it does not help matters that the direction is simple and amateurish.<br /><br />Avoid this lifeless film at all costs. Better to watch GREENCARD which has a similar plot and has charm and energy. Or, for an unconventional Japanese romance story, check out THE LONG VACATION which has an ample amount of everything LIVING ON TOKYO TIME does

house that might be there in the middle of nowhere and two stay behind to 'care' for the unconscious woman... so what do they do, rather than make her comfortable, cushion her head, cover her up or even move her off the blooming road they just leave her lying on the hard road while they go and make a fire 100 yrds away....and all the time they have a camper van they could put her in...<br /><br

they encounter?.........no they bite huge chunks out of them and rip their heads off... i think they are missing the point...<br /><br />these are not gorgeous sexually deprived former angels they are

{"value":"I had read a few positive reviews of this film, and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was. Positioned as some cross between an AIDS-related story and some kind of \"Ghost\"/\"Blithe Spirit\" tale, this film can't always make it's mind up what it wants to be. <br /><br />Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an \"open\" relationship - Simon is able to have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants. Mark is HIV+ and he and Simon don't seem to have a sex life anymore. When Mark dies, Simon - who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor. Not that his behavior before Mark's death was much different. But Mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts, while getting Simon to open up and admit his true feelings.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Simon is such a selfish SOB, it's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film. By the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic, it's too late to care. Mark, on the other hand, follows in Demi Moore's footsteps from \"Ghost,\" by crying profusely throughout the movie. <br /><br />There is a bizarre switch in tone after Mark returns. Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor, a la the TV show \"Bewitched.\" But that doesn't last long. Once Simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish, with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings. The finale, with a gold-plated muscle-boy angel guiding a tearful Mark to heaven while a chastened, grief-stricken Simon waves goodbye is just stupefying, chiefly because it isn't intentionally funny.","finished_norm":["i","have","read","a","few","posit","review","of","thi","film","and","be","truli","surpris","at","how","dread","the","whole","thing","be","posit","a","some","cross","between","a","aidsrel","stori","and","some","kind","of","ghostblith","spirit","tale","thi","film","ca","not","alwai","make","it","mind","up","what","it","want","to","be","br","br","simon","and","mark","be","a","gai","coupl","who","have","a","open","relationship","simon","be","abl","to","have","anonym","though","safe","sex","on","the","side","when","he","want","mark","be","hiv","+","and","he","and","simon","do","not","seem","to","have","a","sex","life","anymor","when","mark","die","simon","who","have","make","a","habit","of","shut","off","hi","emot","after","be","reject","year","ago","by","hi","father","try","to","eras","hi","memori","and","just","get","on","with","be","a","bachelor","not","that","hi","behavior","befor","mark","death","be","much","differ","but","mark","return","in","ghostli","form","and","foil","hi","variou","tryst","while","get","simon","to","open","up","and","admit","hi","true","feelingsbr","br","unfortun","simon","be","such","a","selfish","sob","it","imposs","to","feel","ani","empathi","toward","him","for","much","of","the","film","by","the","time","he","be","suppos","to","be","much","sympathet","it","too","late","to","care","mark","on","the","other","hand","follow","in","demi","moor","footstep","from","ghost","by","cry","profus","throughout","the","movi","br","br","there","be","a","bizarr","switch","in","tone","after","mark","return","suddenli","we","get","some","lame","attempt","at","humor","a","la","the","tv","show","bewitch","but","that","doe","not","last","long","onc","simon","emot","health","be","at","stake","the","whole","thing","becom","increasingli","mawkish","with","amateurish","attempt","to","jerk","at","your","heartstr","the","final","with","a","goldplat","muscleboi","angel","guid","a","tear","mark","to","heaven","while","a","chasten","griefstricken","simon","wave","goodby","be","just","stupefi","chiefli","becaus","it","be","not","intention","funni"],"filtered":["read","posit","review","thi","film","truli","surpris","dread","whole","thing","posit","cross","aidsrel","stori","kind","ghostblith","spirit","tale","thi","film","ca","alwai","make","mind","want","br","br","simon","mark","gai","coupl","open","relationship","simon","abl","anonym","though","safe","sex","side","want","mark","hiv","+","simon","seem","sex","life","anymor","mark","die","simon","make","habit","shut","hi","emot","reject","year","ago","hi","father","try","eras","hi","memori","get","bachelor","hi","behavior","befor","mark","death","much","differ","mark","return","ghostli","form","foil","hi","variou","tryst","get","simon","open","admit","hi","true","feelingsbr","br","unfortun","simon","selfish","sob","imposs","feel","ani","empathi","toward","much","film","time","suppos","much","sympathet","late","care","mark","hand","follow","demi","moor","footstep","ghost","cry","profus","throughout","movi","br","br","bizarr","switch","tone","mark","return","suddenli","get","lame","attempt","humor","la","tv","show","bewitch","doe","last","long","onc","simon","emot","health","stake","whole","thing","becom","increasingli","mawkish","amateurish","attempt","jerk","heartstr","final","goldplat","muscleboi","angel","guid","tear","mark","heaven","chasten","griefstricken","simon","wave","goodby","stupefi","chiefli","becaus","intention","funni"],"filtered2":["read","posit","review","truli","surpris","dread","whole","thing","posit","cross","aidsrel","stori","kind","ghostblith","spirit","tale","ca","alwai","make","mind","want","simon","mark","gai","coupl","open","relationship","simon","abl","anonym","though","safe","sex","side","want","mark","hiv","+","simon","seem","sex","life","anymor","mark","die","simon","make","habit","shut","emot","reject","year","ago","father","try","eras","memori","get","bachelor","behavior","befor","mark","death","differ","mark","return","ghostli","form","foil","variou","tryst","get","simon","open","admit","true","feelingsbr","unfortun","simon","selfish","sob","imposs","feel","ani","empathi","toward","time","suppos","sympathet","late","care","mark","hand","follow","demi","moor","footstep","ghost","cry","profus","throughout","bizarr","switch","tone","mark","return","suddenli","get","lame","attempt","humor","la","tv","show","bewitch","doe","last","long","onc","simon","emot","health","stake","whole","thing","becom","increasingli","mawkish","amateurish","attempt","jerk","heartstr","final","goldplat","muscleboi","angel","guid","tear","mark","heaven","chasten","griefstricken","simon","wave","goodby","stupefi","chiefli","becaus","intention","funni"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,8,17,18,22,27,28,29,35,36,37,43,57,62,75,79,81,86,99,111,115,122,144,145,149,150,156,172,176,177,197,204,205,227,235,236,238,242,245,253,254,260,293,304,326,342,343,369,372,425,438,454,488,506,509,563,577,610,640,690,691,717,727,766,785,820,8

{"value":"Being a slasher film aficionado, I typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas, which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain, I will say. While channel surfing the other night, Sleepaway Camp II happened to cross paths with me. Of course, I wanted to check it out, as I had heard of the Sleepaway Camp franchise, but have never actually seen any of them (for shame, I know). I will note that since I have not seen the original, my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously, because perhaps what I think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise's own design.<br /><br />Now I'm assuming that the franchise of Sleepaway Camp is, in itself, a joke on itself. Hell, even the name comes off as an intentional joke. Sleep away camp? It's good fun. I can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value, but that's about as far as I can go. The acting in this movie made the cast of the original Friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of Macbeth. Campy requires bad acting, but come on. Pamela Springsteen as the evil out-of-touch-with-reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast. As far as comedy goes, there were a few times where I chuckled, but it was few and far between.<br /><br />Ultimately, SAC II is pretty boring, and I really did want to sleep away the camp. The deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them. If you're looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp, I recommend Club Dread. If your channel surfing takes you across this one, check and see what else is

{"value":"...This would be the worst film i'd ever seen. Hmmm, OK maybe tied with Boogeyman then. Awful, truly awful.<br /><br />I had low expectations and it failed to meet them! I honestly cant think of one good thing. so here are the worst points...<br /><br />1. THE ACTING 2. THE PLOT 3. THE CGI (Xbox 360 has better graphics....seriously) 4. THE PLOT 5. THE DIALOGUE and finally.... 6. THE PLOT <br /><br />There are so many unanswered questions, Did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they hadn't put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no-one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than Superman's son and the henchman he kills?!!<br /><br />Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey to do it?<br /><br />When Superman goes to hospital, why don't the doctors ask \"What the F*** do you want us to do?! He's a F***ing alien! We don't know jack about his anatomy!\"? <br /><br />What happened in the 5 years Superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years? <br /><br />Where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie?<br /><br />and finally, Why? Just, Why? <br /><br />BTW, for those of you wondering how come Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite, i think i've figured it out...<br /><br />...since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly all in his head. therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock....<br /><br />either that or

{"value":"I honestly can't believe what passes for entertainment now. Death (and making fun of death), violence, sexual innuendo, adults threatening children, crudeness, alcohol abuse by minors, drug theft, dysfunctional parents, babysitter from hell, stereotypical jokes about African Americans, police and fat people, and kids sneaking out of the house in the middle of the night - yup, sure sounds like a kids movie to me - NOT!!! Add to that the dark and scary elements - a dead woman possessing and turning into a house and keeping her loving husband a prisoner inside for over 20 years, and also terrorizing an entire neighborhood - how sweet for kids. PARENTS - is this really what you want your kids to be watching - is this what you want to teach them about life?!<br /><br />This movie is too scary for young kids, and i'm afraid that teens today may be living some of this movie scenario - so why rub it in their faces? As for an adult audience - you won't find it scary or amusing - just boring, contrived and predictable. And the characters are just wrong - clueless parents, ignorant police, stupid and annoying friends, nasty and manipulative babysitters, and beer drinking/womanizing boyfriends. What great material for kids - does this really sound like a children's movie to anyone? Even the computer animation and good voice work aren't enough to redeem this terrible flick. Save your money, save your time, and save your children's minds - go rent Ice Age, Monsters Inc., the Incredibles, Shrek, A Bug's Life - ANY of them are way better than this horrid film. Spielberg and Zemeckis - shame on both of you for making such a disaster and then billing it as a children's/family

{"value":"Well OK, I watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now I pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and I must say, I actually think this movie is good. This movie caught a buzz as the bootleg I Know What You Did Last Summer 3, much like Final Stab was to Scream 4, and well this movie isn't that bad. I mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick, this movie is not half bad. It has some scares, and some really hot women I might add. Plus it shows off Joey Lawrence's new beefy look though obviously even that hasn't won him any big Hollywood roles either......I feel bad for the man, he had such a career in the early and mid 90's with blossom, some Disney movies and the everlasting Lawrence brothers show.....Joey Lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene, but then like in a 360 degree turn, his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one.<br /><br />The movie also throws you off guard in, it makes you think between the crew, there really is a secret that someone knows, to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret. It also throws you off on who the killer is, I had an idea but still woulnd't think the killer was who he was, but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown. Now, had there been a secret that was let out? This movie could've been one of the better b rated movies. But also I am a sucker for college themes and I also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie.<br /><br />A so-so slasher flick.

{"value":"1st watched 4/29/2007 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Mick Garris): Campy vampire-like Stephen King movie has so many strange and goofy elements that you start laughing over the extreme weirdness about 3/4 the way into the movie and you wonder if this movie might have a cult following for King fans. It's the story of a mother and son who are sleepwalkers(a shape-shifting feline-like, flesh eating, life needing, near extinct breed of humanoid) who move from town to town searching for virgins to feed on to keep themselves alive. They come across as pretty normal upper-class folk except they are secret lovers and cats hang around the outside of their home, day and night. Cats are deadly to them, so they set traps in their yard to try and keep the population down. We get to see them break a couple of their necks when they attack(which is also a first in my movie-going experience) --- hopefully no real cats were harmed in the making of the film. The boy is after a sweet girl that he has a crush on until he turns into a \"sleepwalker\" and then he just wants her body. There is so much campy uniqueness to this movie that it might have been better if it was an all-out satirical comedy on suburban life, but the director instead tries to scare you every couple minutes until you wish he'd just get over it and bring out the gore. Eventually that happens and the movie winds down to it's typical Stephen King downbeat ending. The movie is interesting because King's humor comes thru more than usual but his weirdness is also very present and what you have is a movie that his fans will probably like and should have in their collection, but as a worthwhile movie experience it really doesn't cut it.","finished_norm":["st","watch","out","of","dirmick","garri","campi","vampirelik","stephen","king","movi","have","so","mani","strang","and","goofi","elem","that","you","start","laugh","over","the","extrem","weird","about","the","wai","into","the","movi","and","you","wonder","if","thi","movi","mai","have","a","cult","follow","for","king","fan","it","the","stori","of","a","mother","and","son","who","be","sleepwalkersa","shapeshift","felinelik","flesh","eat","life","ne","near","extinct","bre","of","humanoid","who","move","from","town","to","town","search","for","virgin","to","fee","on","to","keep","themselv","aliv","thei","come","across","a","pretti","normal","upperclass","folk","except","thei","be","secret","lover","and","cat","hang","around","the","outsid","of","their","home","dai","and","night","cat","be","deadli","to","them","so","thei","set","trap","in","their","yard","to","try","and","keep","the","popul","down","we","get","to","see","them","break","a","coupl","of","their","neck","when","thei","attackwhich","be","conjur","a","in","my","moviego","experi","hopefulli","no","real","cat","be","harm","in","the","make","of","the","film","the","boi","be","after","a","sweet","girl","that","he","have","a","crush","on","until","he","turn","into","a","sleepwalk","and","then","he","just","want","her","bodi","there","be","so","much","campi","uniqu","to","thi","movi","that","it","mai","have","be","well","if","it","be","a","allout","satir","comedi","on","suburban","life","but","the","director","instead","try","to","scare","you","everi","coupl","minut","until","you","wish","he","have","just","get","over","it","and","bring","out","the","gore","eventu","that","happen","and","the","movi","wind","down","to","it","typic","stephen","king","downbeat","end","the","movi","be","interest","becaus","king","humor","come","thru","much","than","usual","but","hi","weird","be","conjur","veri","present","and","what","you","have","be","a","movi","that","hi","fan","will","probabl","like","and","should","have","in","their","collect","but","a","a","worthwhil","movi","experi","it","realli","doe","not","cut","it"],"filtered":["st","watch","dirmick","garri","campi","vampirelik","stephen","king","movi","mani","strang","goofi","elem","start","laugh","extrem","weird","wai","movi","wonder","thi","movi","mai","cult","follow","king","fan","stori","mother","son","sleepwalkersa","shapeshift","felinelik","flesh","eat","life","ne","near","extinct","bre","humanoid","move","town","town","search","virgin","fee","keep","themselv","aliv","thei","come","across","pretti","normal","upperclass","folk","except","thei","secret","lover","cat","hang","around","outsid","home","dai","night","cat","deadli","thei","set","trap","yard","try","keep","popul","get","see","break","coupl","neck","thei","attackwhich","conjur","moviego","experi","hopefulli","real","cat","harm","make","film","boi","sweet","girl","crush","turn","sleepwalk","want","bodi","much","campi","uniqu","thi","movi","mai","well","allout","satir","comedi","suburban","life","director","instead","try","scare","everi","coupl","minut","wish","get","bring","gore","eventu","happen","movi","wind","typic","stephen","king","downbeat","end","movi","interest","becaus","king","humor","come","thru","much","usual","hi","weird","conjur","veri","present","movi","hi","fan","probabl","like","collect","worthwhil","movi","experi","realli","doe","cut"],"filtered2":["st","watch","dirmick","garri","campi","vampirelik","stephen","king","mani","strang","goofi","elem","start","laugh","extrem","weird","wai","wonder","mai","cult","follow","king","fan","stori","mother","son","sleepwalkersa","shapeshift","felinelik","flesh","eat","life","ne","near","extinct","bre","humanoid","move","town","town","search","virgin","fee","keep","themselv","aliv","come","across","pretti","normal","upperclass","folk","except","secret","lover","cat","hang","around","outsid","home","dai","night","cat","deadli","set","trap","yard","try","keep","popul","get","see","break","coupl","neck","attackwhich","conjur","moviego","experi","hopefulli","real","cat","harm","make","boi","sweet","girl","crush","turn","sleepwalk","want","bodi","campi","uniqu","mai","well","allout","satir","comedi","suburban","life","director","instead","try","scare","everi","coupl","minut","wish","get","bring","gore","eventu","happen","wind","typic","stephen","king","downbeat","end","interest","becaus","king","humor","come","thru","usual","weird","conjur","veri","present","fan","probabl","like","collect","worthwhil","experi","realli","doe","cut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,13,15,17,18,20,22,24,33,34,36,37,39,46,50,58,59,60,71,75,78,80,84,85,94,96,98,109,110,127,132,133,134,140,148,152,175,210,233,250,253,260,265,275,282,302,303,329,333,358,360,369,376,397,399,411,417,434,436,450,479,503,541,555,599,613,623,625,700,716,791,792,798,848,933,954,1005,1009,1026,1048,1089,1127,1154,1279,1301,1344,1347,1388,1733,1758,1840,1944,1987,1997,2016,2160,2313,2511,2809,3161,3174,3273,

{"value":"The highlight of this movie for me was without doubt Tom Hanks. As Mike Sullivan, he was definitely cast against type and showed that he can handle an untraditional (for him) role. Hanks is usually the good guy in a movie - the one you like, admire and root for. Sullivan was definitely not a good guy. It's true that in the context of this movie he came across as somewhat noble - his purpose being to avenge the murders of his wife and youngest son. Even so, he was already a gangster and murderer before those killings. So Hanks took a role I wouldn't have expected him in, and he pulled it off well.<br /><br />Hanks' good performance aside, though, I certainly couldn't call this an enjoyable movie. After an opening that I would best describe as enigmatic (it wasn't entirely clear to me for a while where this was going) it turns into a very sombre movie, about the complicated relationships Sullivan has developed as a gangster - largely raised by Rooney (Paul Newman), who's a sort of mob boss, and trying to raise his own two sons and to keep them \"clean\" so to speak; isolated from his business. After the older son witnesses a murder, the gang tries to kill him to keep him quiet, gets the wrong son (and the mother), and leaves Sullivan and his older son (Mike, Jr.) on the run. It becomes a weird sort of father/son bonding movie.<br /><br />Although it ends on a somewhat hopeful note (at least in the overall context of the story) it's really very dark throughout, that mood being reinforced with many of the scenes being shot in darkness and torrential rainfall. I have to confess that while I appreciated Hanks' performance, the movie as a whole just didn't pull me in.

{"value":"Not that I tinkle myself with glee at the sight of realistic blood shed, but when I put a DVD in expecting a bloodbath, and what I get is one bloody scene (the eyeball) at the tail end of asinine fake slapping, and spinning in a desk chair, I end up thinking \"well that's 43 minutes of my life gone forever.\" I wouldn't considers this or Flower of Flesh and Blood \"movies\" so much as an exercise of will; to see if you can sit through them. Flower of Flesh and Blood had a few tough spots to watch. The Devil's Experiment did not. It was at best, stupid, and at worst...well...really stupid. Perhaps my expectation were too high. I put the DVD thinking \"oh man, this is gonna be sick.\" After watching them fake slap the girl about a thousand times, I was watching it in fast forward.<br /><br />Two kinds of people would be interested in this film. 1) People who seek out F'd up films just to see how F'd up it really is, or 2) horror completest. I sought this and the other Guinea Pig films for the latter reason, but even if I fell into the category of the former, this film wouldn't float my boat. As a matter of fact, I could imagine this film increasing one's blood lust...as in \"WOULD YOU JUST KILL THE B*TCH ALREADY!!\" So in conclusion, the only reason to own this film is for collection purposes. If you want carnage that traditional horror doesn't provide, get Traces of Death. Sure, that sucks too, but at least you'll get the blood and guts you expect.<br /><br />The only reason I can see for anyone praising this crap is because they feel they're supposed to. No artistic merit that I can comprehend, no reason for it's notoriety, no nothing.

{"value":"Acting was weak, but in a horror flick, I can live with that if the story is good. It wasn't. The initial event was an clumsy and obvious ploy to exploit most people's adoration of kids. OK, fine. Fast forward to the \"place in the country\" where they will recover emotionally. I like the revelation of the ghosts. OK, cool--this will be a supernatural kinda horror story, with rotting things partly in our world partly in...where ever. Then the action starts pulling like a three headed dog in a flurry of cats and birds--Is there an evil force trying to attack them directly? Is there an evil force trying to attack them INdirectly--make people do awful things they wouldn't really do? Oh, wait, no, maybe the whole REGION is some kind of psychic echo chamber where ambient discord can reverberate into murder? OK, hold on--maybe it's really just one little mentally tangled \"Delbert\"-style redneck boy who misses his Mommy and is on some kind of spree like a K-Tel Norman Bates knock off? Oh, yeah--extra points off: the only Black character seems to be the grandson of an \"Our Gang\" pullman porter. The actor plays it as straight as he can given the crummy dialogue, but the fact is, his purpose is \"Y'all done betta get outa heah, Boss!\" At least they wrote him smart enough to GTF outta there. The bit with the little girl being silenced and pulled away was definitely creepy, as was the chick in the shower. Those were just two of quite a few really delicious tidbits in this movie. The problem is that they are combined in disharmonious ways, like a bite of steak, a bite of chocolate and a bite of a Gummi bear. Each is great on it's own, but mixed up? Bleah! Such potential.

{"value":"This was one of the worst Wrestlemania's I've seen. It just didn't stand out at all, really. Card wise, I thought it was going to be pretty good, but every match just seemed to fall short.<br /><br />Chris Benoit vs. MVP One of the better matches. Benoit carried it. I just didn't think MVP was that great, but Benoit saved this match. <br /><br />Kane vs. Khali Wow, these two guys don't mix. Or maybe it's Khali and any other person alive don't mix. Awful match.<br /><br />Melina vs. Ashley I'm not a fan of female wrestling.<br /><br />ECW Originals vs. New Breed I was excited about this match, until I saw it. Really, Really disappointing.<br /><br />Edge vs. CM Punk vs. King Booker vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy vs. Mr. Kennedy vs. Finlay vs. Randy Orton Absolutely the worst MITB match so far. Just a major let down, to many people in the ring at the same time. It just didn't live up.<br /><br />Bobby Lashley vs. Umaga O.K. not extremely impressive, but not the worst of the night.<br /><br />Batista vs. Undertaker This was maybe the best match of the night. Very, very, very nice to see something good for a change. <br /><br />John Cena vs. Shawn Michaels I really feel like this match deserved to be last. People make a case for Batista vs. Undertaker, but this match was just as good. I am starting to get sick of seeing Cena win every match though. It's getting a little old. Now, I have to say, I feel this match is the best of the night, but I'm a huge Shawn Michaels fan, so I'm a little biased. Batista vs. 'Taker may have been better, but I'm biased, so...sorry. The last two were undoubtedly the best matches of the night and most everything else really came up short.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","wrestlemania","i","have","see","it","just","do","not","stand","out","at","all","realli","card","wise","i","think","it","be","go","to","be","pretti","good","but","everi","match","just","seem","to","fall","shortbr","br","chri","benoit","v","mvp","on","of","the","well","match","benoit","carri","it","i","just","do","not","think","mvp","be","that","great","but","benoit","save","thi","match","br","br","kane","v","khali","wow","thi","two","gui","do","not","mix","or","mayb","it","khali","and","ani","other","person","aliv","do","not","mix","aw","matchbr","br","melina","v","ashlei","i","be","not","a","fan","of","femal","wrestlingbr","br","ecw","origin","v","new","bre","i","be","excit","about","thi","match","until","i","see","it","realli","realli","disappointingbr","br","edg","v","cm","punk","v","king","booker","v","jeff","hardi","v","matt","hardi","v","mr","kennedi","v","finlai","v","randi","orton","absolut","the","wrong","mitb","match","so","far","just","a","major","let","down","to","mani","peopl","in","the","ring","at","the","same","time","it","just","do","not","live","upbr","br","bobbi","lashlei","v","umaga","okai","not","extrem","impress","but","not","the","wrong","of","the","nightbr","br","batista","v","undertak","thi","be","mayb","the","well","match","of","the","night","veri","veri","veri","nice","to","see","someth","good","for","a","chang","br","br","john","cena","v","shawn","michael","i","realli","feel","like","thi","match","deserv","to","be","last","peopl","make","a","case","for","batista","v","undertak","but","thi","match","be","just","a","good","i","be","start","to","get","sick","of","see","cena","win","everi","match","though","it","get","a","littl","old","now","i","have","to","sai","i","feel","thi","match","be","the","well","of","the","night","but","i","be","a","huge","shawn","michael","fan","so","i","be","a","littl","bia","batista","v","taker","mai","have","be","well","but","i","be","bia","sosorri","the","last","two","be","undoubtedli","the","well","match","of","the","night","and","much","everyth","els","realli","come","up","short"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","wrestlemania","see","stand","realli","card","wise","think","go","pretti","good","everi","match","seem","fall","shortbr","br","chri","benoit","v","mvp","well","match","benoit","carri","think","mvp","great","benoit","save","thi","match","br","br","kane","v","khali","wow","thi","two","gui","mix","mayb","khali","ani","person","aliv","mix","aw","matchbr","br","melina","v","ashlei","fan","femal","wrestlingbr","br","ecw","origin","v","new","bre","excit","thi","match","see","realli","realli","disappointingbr","br","edg","v","cm","punk","v","king","booker","v","jeff","hardi","v","matt","hardi","v","mr","kennedi","v","finlai","v","randi","orton","absolut","wrong","mitb","match","far","major","let","mani","peopl","ring","time","live","upbr","br","bobbi","lashlei","v","umaga","okai","extrem","impress","wrong","nightbr","br","batista","v","undertak","thi","mayb","well","match","night","veri","veri","veri","nice","see","someth","good","chang","br","br","john","cena","v","shawn","michael","realli","feel","like","thi","match","deserv","last","peopl","make","case","batista","v","undertak","thi","match","good","start","get","sick","see","cena","win","everi","match","though","get","littl","old","sai","feel","thi","match","well","night","huge","shawn","michael","fan","littl","bia","batista","v","taker","mai","well","bia","sosorri","last","two","undoubtedli","well","match","night","much","everyth","els","realli","come","short"],"filtered2":["wrong","wrestlemania","see","stand","realli","card","wise","think","go","pretti","good","everi","match","seem","fall","shortbr","chri","benoit","v","mvp","well","match","benoit","carri","think","mvp","great","benoit","save","match","kane","v","khali","wow","two","gui","mix","mayb","khali","ani","person","aliv","mix","aw","matchbr","melina","v","ashlei","fan","femal","wrestlingbr","ecw","origin","v","new","bre","excit","match","see","realli","realli","disappointingbr","edg","v","cm","punk","v","king","booker","v","jeff","hardi","v","matt","hardi","v","mr","kennedi","v","finlai","v","randi","orton","absolut","wrong","mitb","match","far","major","let","mani","peopl","ring","time","live","upbr","bobbi","lashlei","v","umaga","okai","extrem","impress","wrong","nightbr","batista","v","undertak","mayb","well","match","night","veri","veri","veri","nice","see","someth","good","chang","john","cena","v","shawn","michael","realli","feel","like","match","deserv","last","peopl","make","case","batista","v","undertak","match","good","start","get","sick","see","cena","win","everi","match","though","get","littl","old","feel","match","well","night","huge","shawn","michael","fan","littl","bia","batista","v","taker","mai","well","bia","sosorri","last","two","undoubtedli","well","match","night","everyth","els","realli","come","short"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,8,12,

{"value":"I have to say I was very curious on viewing this film, and it was considered a notorious disaster when released by 20th Century Fox in 1970. It has also popped up on several critics lists of bad films, and this only deepened an interest, as I just had to see what made this movie so bad.Upon seeing it, I think I have my answers. Although I will say it does make for curious viewing, the acting, direction, and script are so laughingly bad, that the supposed satire is completely missing. Racquel Welch seems to try to carry the film, but after the opening sequence of the sex-change operation, the film goes so far down hill that she cannot handle this task alone. John Huston as Uncle Buck Loner is certainly no help, as he licks and leers at the screen, he sometimes looks like he wonders himself what he's doing there. Rex Reed bounces around as Myron, Myra's alter ego, and even has his own celebrated masturbation scene. Bravo for debut performances! Farrah Fawcett plays a dumb blonde; she certainly seemed convincing in this role. But , of course, arguably the most notorious role went to Mae west. The sight of a 75 year old woman with a plastic face making sexual innuendos seemed more suitable for a horror film. I don't mean to put this cast down personally; but in this film, no one comes out looking good. The direction seems so unassured and non-existent, that the film is not only bad, but boring as well. Throw in some old film footage of old stars, and the movie becomes even more disconnected. To each his own to anyone that enjoyed this, and I was glad I at least saw it, but Myra Breckenridge seems to be the disaster that it was always reputed to be from the

{"value":"This movie has received a lot of bad press from people who don't understand what it was meant to be. One must understand that this movie was never meant to be taken seriously. It's camp, along the same lines as \"Army of Darkness.\" AoD was silly, but funny and bad in a good way. \"House of the Dead\" fails to be \"good bad.\".<br /><br />There are qualities inherent in good campy movies, most important of those being believable fantasy. One needs to believe what's happening in a movie to see the humor when a situation goes incredibly wrong. Without boundaries, the movie becomes absurd. HotD lacks any believability.<br /><br />Worse still, HotD brings nothing new to the genre, and repeats the same plot twists and character reactions that many horror movies inevitably start to exhibit. For example, all too often, horror movies fall into the trap where the main characters find love amongst the gore and destruction. I don't know about you, but when I'm being chased by zombies, I wanna make out with a hot chick. Believe it? No? Then, you probably won't believe it when the characters start sucking each other's faces in this movie.<br /><br />Beyond the obvious issues that plague this movie like so many other horror movies, Uwe Boll elected to add scenes from the video game of zombies being shot, randomly whenever a character shoots a zombie in the movie. Not only is there no clear rationale for this artistic choice, but it distracts one from an already unbelievable plot. Further, there are frequent and numerous examples of bad acting, and seemingly no attempts by the director to guide the actors' reactions to events... leaving the movie with no redeeming qualities.

{"value":"Believe it or don't, i have my very own DVD copy of this \"movie\" which i bought at Walgreens for a great big whole dollar. I'm still not sure if it was a dollar well spent or a dollar foolishly wasted.<br /><br />Pretty amazing set designs and costumes. Apparently much thought and effort went into their making. The set designs are very Mexican in stylization. I liked them a lot. And Santa is impressive. One of the more impressive Santas in moviedom.<br /><br />I'm guessing the original intent and purpose of this movie was to be something uplifting and cheerful for a kids audience. But, somehow, it comes across quite deranged. In fact, i'm left stunned at how deranged it is.<br /><br />Maybe it's the English dubbing that makes it seems so deranged and bizarre. One of the reasons i prefer to experience movies in the original language they were made and the use of English subtitles as dubbing often gives an unintended strangeness. The kid voices were at least dubbed with actual kid voices as opposed to women pretending to be kids which tends to sound very, very weird.<br /><br />Did you know that demons in hell spend their free time dancing around doing ballet in their longjohns? You didn't? Neither did i until i watched this movie. One learns something new everyday.<br /><br />Is this movie actually worth watching? Now, that's a tossup. I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone as it's quite disturbing in its own bizarre way. Yet, its unintentional bizarreness is what makes it worth watching.

{"value":"What a disappointment, especially in light of the budget provided, the technical resources available, and the talent assembled. Isn't the fundamental rule for science fiction/drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief. POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning, suckering us in, but thereinafter Mr. Burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains. The over the top libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter's chimp, the worthlessness of the humans' lockup, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary skills of horsemanship (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt), the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable. Mark Wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down. Compare to the original, in which Chuck Heston's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events. The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation, and we never really wonder about his well being. Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in real jeopardy. Tim Burton should have used some of the f/x budget for some competent screenwriting. In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats. Let them walk. Trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in Planet of the Apes 2001. I'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent.

{"value":"This movie is one of the most unintentionally bad action films ever put to film. Dolph Friggin' Lundren with a Japanese accent is funny enough, but add really corny buddy-buddy action to the mix, an eccentric and over-the-top villain, a clichéd love interest subplot and one of the worst endings of all time, and you've got yourself quite the little suicide-inducing cure for people who enjoy their life and, up till watching \"Showdown,\" had never contemplated killing themselves with a blowtorch.<br /><br />I don't know if it's just me but the whole homosexual subtext is none too subtle. There are constant references to male genitalia, and not by females, either. Brandon Lee and Dolphin talk about each other's manly parts, and in fact before going on a suicide spree, Brandon says to Dolphy, \"In case we don't make it, I want to tell you, you have the biggest d--- I've ever seen.\"<br /><br />Now, is this what a normal man would say to another man? In an ACTION film no less? And would you want those to be your _dying words_??<br /><br />Later, there's this gem:<br /><br />Dolph (regarding the villain): \"I would like to cut off certain parts of his anatomy.\" Brandon: \"Man, you've got a fixation.\" <br /><br />As the guy at RuthlessReviews.com pointed out, \"Unfortunately, Dolph doesn't respond with, 'I've got a fixation? I've got a fixation?! You're the one who decided that his last words should be about my privates! I was just gonna chop of his ears and his nose, man.\"<br /><br />This is relentlessly silly stuff and great fun if you're someone who enjoys receiving root canals from unlicensed dentists, without novocain.

{"value":"I usually try to be professional and constructive when I criticize movies, but my GOD!!! This was THE worst movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, bad effects, bad script, bad everything! <br /><br />The plot follows a group of teen cliche's on their way to a rave (that takes place in broad daylight) at a remote island. However, when the group arrives, all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes. Determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party-goers, the clan set's off on a mission through a zombie-infested forest. During this crusade, they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids. They also meet up with Jonathan Cherry and some other survivors. Basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the \"house of the dead.\" This fight came complete with cheesy Hollywood violence, redundant clips from the HOTD video game, and sloppy matrix-esque camera rotations. One of the character's even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others. Why? Not because he was noble and brave, but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled! I'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy?!?<br /><br />To sum it all up, there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is. The theater I was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen, and I'm sure the money I wasted seeing this piece of sh*t could easily cover the costs it took to make it.

{"value":"In case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar, it means you watch way too much of this gory Italian cult-crap! For you see, the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie, he also took the liberty of re-using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) \"Cat in the Brain\". The opening scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe, features in Fulci's later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments. Andrea Bianchi's \"Masssacre\" fails miserably as a giallo, since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie-crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful, but it's still good entertainment if you're into cheap 'n shlocky horror trash. The incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who're all potential maniacs, but none of the red herrings Biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately. Whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make-up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast. Whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen, like between the first and second murder, \"Massacre\" is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography. Thankfully in the second half, there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes. The music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative. My advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned \"Cat in the Brain\".

{"value":"Curiously, Season 6 of the Columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts, based on this outing for the \"man-in-the-mac\" and also \"Fade into Murder\".<br /><br />Furthermore, it is not a coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts (incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here).<br /><br />This adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material. The story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversation.<br /><br />Columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here(similar to \"Last Salute to the Commodore\") but the entertainment value is minimal. To add to this, Celeste's Holm characterisation, which is intended to provide comedy, induces embarrassment rather than laughs.<br /><br />The script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift Columbo the case, though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crime.<br /><br />Ironically, what turns out to be, arguably, Columbo's worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series. He quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircut/manicure at the same time. The next 5 minutes are hilarious - it's just that Columbo's hair is so perfectly groomed, then he can't afford to pay the bill and then, when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstyle!<br /><br />Sadly, this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes. <br /><br />For Columbo completionists only.","finished_norm":["curious","season","of","the","columbo","seri","contain","onli","three","episod","and","there","be","veri","littl","evid","of","qualiti","in","at","littl","two","of","the","script","base","on","thi","out","for","the","maninthemac","and","conjur","fade","into","murderbr","br","furthermor","it","be","not","a","coincid","that","peter","feibleman","pen","both","the","aforement","script","incident","he","plai","the","part","of","the","murder","secur","guard","herebr","br","thi","adventur","be","veri","rare","compel","and","mani","of","the","perform","just","look","disinterest","with","the","materi","the","stori","be","rather","weakli","develop","with","some","protract","period","of","bore","conversationbr","br","columbo","be","conjur","shadow","by","a","colleagu","heresimilar","to","last","salut","to","the","commodor","but","the","entertain","valu","be","minim","to","add","to","thi","celest","holm","characteris","which","be","intend","to","provid","comedi","induc","embarrass","rather","than","laughsbr","br","the","script","waver","off","to","deal","with","the","famili","histori","and","the","murderess","doe","enough","to","gift","columbo","the","case","though","there","be","never","a","credibl","discuss","relat","to","the","motiv","of","her","crimebr","br","iron","what","turn","out","to","be","arguabl","columbo","wrong","adventur","produc","the","funni","moment","in","the","seri","he","quiz","a","male","hairdress","and","have","a","haircutmanicur","at","the","same","time","the","next","minut","be","hilari","it","just","that","columbo","hair","be","so","perfectli","groom","then","he","ca","not","afford","to","pai","the","bill","and","then","when","he","make","enquiri","at","a","jewel","he","keep","glanc","in","the","mirror","to","admir","hi","hairstylebr","br","sadli","thi","be","the","onli","decent","moment","from","a","script","that","look","like","it","have","be","cobbl","togeth","in","ten","minut","br","br","for","columbo","completionist","onli"],"filtered":["curious","season","columbo","seri","contain","onli","three","episod","veri","littl","evid","qualiti","littl","two","script","base","thi","maninthemac","conjur","fade","murderbr","br","furthermor","coincid","peter","feibleman","pen","aforement","script","incident","plai","part","murder","secur","guard","herebr","br","thi","adventur","veri","rare","compel","mani","perform","look","disinterest","materi","stori","rather","weakli","develop","protract","period","bore","conversationbr","br","columbo","conjur","shadow","colleagu","heresimilar","last","salut","commodor","entertain","valu","minim","add","thi","celest","holm","characteris","intend","provid","comedi","induc","embarrass","rather","laughsbr","br","script","waver","deal","famili","histori","murderess","doe","enough","gift","columbo","case","though","never","credibl","discuss","relat","motiv","crimebr","br","iron","turn","arguabl","columbo","wrong","adventur","produc","funni","moment","seri","quiz","male","hairdress","haircutmanicur","time","next","minut","hilari","columbo","hair","perfectli","groom","ca","afford","pai","bill","make","enquiri","jewel","keep","glanc","mirror","admir","hi","hairstylebr","br","sadli","thi","onli","decent","moment","script","look","like","cobbl","togeth","ten","minut","br","br","columbo","completionist","onli"],"filtered2":["curious","season","columbo","contain","onli","three","veri","littl","evid","qualiti","littl","two","script","base","maninthemac","conjur","fade","murderbr","furthermor","coincid","peter","feibleman","pen","aforement","script","incident","plai","part","murder","secur","guard","herebr","adventur","veri","rare","compel","mani","perform","look","disinterest","materi","stori","rather","weakli","develop","protract","period","bore","conversationbr","columbo","conjur","shadow","colleagu","heresimilar","last","salut","commodor","entertain","valu","minim","add","celest","holm","characteris","intend","provid","comedi","induc","embarrass","rather","laughsbr","script","waver","deal","famili","histori","murderess","doe","enough","gift","columbo","case","though","never","credibl","discuss","relat","motiv","crimebr","iron","turn","arguabl","columbo","wrong","adventur","produc","funni","moment","quiz","male","hairdress","haircutmanicur","time","next","minut","hilari","columbo","hair","perfectli","groom","ca","afford","pai","bill","make","enquiri","jewel","keep","glanc","mirror","admir","hairstylebr","sadli","onli","decent","moment","script","look","like","cobbl","togeth","ten","minut","columbo","completionist","onli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,8,11,14,15,16,17,18,25,39,40,42,47,50,59,61,62,77,81,86,93,96,105,108,127,134,144,160,182,188,195,224,261,270,273,288,297,299,309,319,320,322,334,451,468,499,537,545,557,632,649,694,705,711,722,743,760,813,817,902,903,926,1013,1015,1076,1208,1246,1254,1273,1309,1326,1475,1591,1728,1768,1853,2067,2151,2165,2360,2670,2776,2804,2816,3132,3187,3399,3443,3772,3791,4092,4244,5385,5540,5916,6

{"value":"Pam Grier stars as Coffy. She's a nurse who seeks revenge, on the drug dealers who got her sister hooked on bad heroine. Like any 70s Blaxploitation flick, you can expect to see the racist bad guys get their just desserts. <br /><br />There were scores of these films made during the 70s, and they were really demeaning to both black and white audiences alike. This is mainly due to the vicious racial hostility in these films, and the degrading, stereotypical characters. Especially the female characters. <br /><br />Other common threads between Coffy, and other films of its type, include brutal violence, corrupt cops, car chases, a generous abundance of nudity, and sex-crazed gorgeous women. Not to mention urban ghettos populated by drug-dealers, pimps, mobsters, and other criminal scum.<br /><br />Pam Grier, was the undisputed queen of 70s Blaxploitation heroines. She was magnificent, being both tough-as-nails, and drop-dead gorgeous. Like in her other films, Pam outshines the other characters, in Coffy. In fact, Pam is so charismatic on screen, that these sorts of films are unwatchable, without her as the main character. <br /><br />If you like Pam Grier, you're better off seeing her other films, like Foxy Brown, or perhaps Friday Foster. These films have much less empty sleaze, than Coffy does. Pam's character in Coffy, degrades herself way too much to get the bad guys. Pam's characters in her other Blaxploitation films, don't stoop as low to get revenge, as Coffy did. <br /><br />I'd say, only watch Coffy, if you're unable to see any of Pam Grier's other films. Otherwise, Coffy is a waste of time.

{"value":"I saw 'Descent' last night at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was one huge disappointment. Disappointment because the storyline was potentially powerful, the prospect of seeing Rosario Dawson in a smaller intimate movie was exciting and, being a fan (sounds pervy, I'm not!) of 'rape/revenge' flicks of the 70's, I was needless to say very curious to check this movie out. My conclusion: let's stick to the classics! Yes, the storyline has potential but the dialogs are flat, the actors unconvincing. Even Dawson is empty. Some would say that it's a right depiction of the college world in the US, that the emptiness of the characters serve a purpose and all that jazz but it just makes the whole movie unsubstantial. Just like the scene where Dawson gets raped: it seriously lacks intensity! I wasn't expecting anything 'Irreversible'-style but still, aren't we suppose to feel compassion for her? I didn't. Not for a minute, she was so lame all the way ;-) And I read that the photography was impressive. Well, it is good indeed but nothing ground-breaking either. I must admit that the screening at the festival wasn't so good so maybe I missed out something here but at the end of the movie, I couldn't help thinking 'I feel like watching Argento's 'Inferno' again. lol. More seriously, the first scene in the club is beautifully shot and all but I had the bitter sensation of watching a longer and more boring version of the scene in the filthy bar near the American-Canadian border in Lynch's 'Twin Peaks - Fire Walk with Me'... the crude red and blue lighting, the heavy bass music, the general lascivious/decadent atmosphere...

{"value":"The movie has several story lines that follow several different characters. The different story lines don't feel like one whole complete piece which makes this comedy a very incoherent one and gets even annoying to watch at times.<br /><br />It may sound weak and cliché but it's true; You're way better of watching the Crocodile Hunter series on the Discovery channel with Steve and Terri Irwin. It's more fun and even more hilarious than this movie is. I'm sure both cast and crew had lots of fun making this movie but the movie doesn't give us the viewers much pleasure. For a comedy it simply isn't funny enough and Steve and Terri Irwin just aren't good actors, not even when they play themselves! Their antics are simply not good enough to make an entire movie around and their scene's feel long, distracting and unnecessary and even annoying at times.<br /><br />The movie had quite some potential, I mean Steve Irwin is one character that in a strange way is both intriguing and hilarious to watch, so when I first heard that they were making a movie about 'the crocodile hunter' my first reaction was; brilliant! The movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters. The movie does has a certain entertainment value, at least enough to make this movie watchable for at least once but still, I must certainly wouldn't recommend this movie.<br /><br />Watching this movie felt like a waste of time. Still this movie might be watchable just once, when it gets on TV, on a rainy afternoon. It does has some good moments but the story lines really completely ruin the movie and its potential.<br /><br
