{"value":"I made a special effort to see this movie and was totally disappointed with the outcome. On paper, the script seems hopeful, and the choice of actors leaves one with hopes - I liked Pacino in Scent of a Woman and have seen Anny Duperrey and Marthe Keller in several French and other films of the 70s/80s. But I had forgotten how important a part dialogues can play in a film, and in this film they are absolute ..... trash ! The filming locations were also attractive but the hopeless, pretentious and forced dialogues pulled the whole thing down to sub zero level. In addition to that, I am pretty allergic to the world of motor racing and find no interest in this sport. Even the inelegant dialogues in \"Love Story\" were better than the ones in this film (and that's saying something !!). I was really expecting better from this film and was very disappointed to have been let down so much.","finished_norm":["i","make","a","special","effort","to","see","thi","movi","and","be","total","disappoint","with","the","outcom","on","paper","the","script","seem","hope","and","the","choic","of","actor","leav","on","with","hope","i","like","pacino","in","scent","of","a","woman","and","have","see","anni","duperrei","and","marth","keller","in","sever","french","and","other","film","of","the","but","i","have","forget","how","import","a","part","dialogu","can","plai","in","a","film","and","in","thi","film","thei","be","absolut","trash","the","film","locat","be","conjur","attract","but","the","hopeless","pretenti","and","forc","dialogu","pull","the","whole","thing","down","to","sub","zero","level","in","addit","to","that","i","be","pretti","allerg","to","the","world","of","motor","race","and","find","no","interest","in","thi","sport","even","the","ineleg","dialogu","in","love","stori","be","well","than","the","on","in","thi","film","and","that","sai","someth","i","be","realli","expect","well","from","thi","film","and","be","veri","disappoint","to","have","be","let","down","so","much"],"filtered":["make","special","effort","see","thi","movi","total","disappoint","outcom","paper","script","seem","hope","choic","actor","leav","hope","like","pacino","scent","woman","see","anni","duperrei","marth","keller","sever","french","film","forget","import","part","dialogu","plai","film","thi","film","thei","absolut","trash","film","locat","conjur","attract","hopeless","pretenti","forc","dialogu","pull","whole","thing","sub","zero","level","addit","pretti","allerg","world","motor","race","find","interest","thi","sport","even","ineleg","dialogu","love","stori","well","thi","film","sai","someth","realli","expect","well","thi","film","veri","disappoint","let","much"],"filtered2":["make","special","effort","see","total","disappoint","outcom","paper","script","seem","hope","choic","actor","leav","hope","like","pacino","scent","woman","see","anni","duperrei","marth","keller","sever","french","forget","import","part","dialogu","plai","absolut","trash","locat","conjur","attract","hopeless","pretenti","forc","dialogu","pull","whole","thing","sub","zero","level","addit","pretti","allerg","world","motor","race","find","interest","sport","even","ineleg","dialogu","love","stori","well","someth","realli","expect","well","veri","disappoint","let"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,13,15,17,20,29,35,38,39,40,41,53,54,60,61,70,74,77,78,111,124,130,165,181,184,187,203,222,248,316,338,373,401,445,544,600,648,671,775,808,899,964,1047,1123,1185,1399,1676,2295,2482,2924,3245,3289,6334,7941],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,13,15,17,20,29,35,38,39,40,41,53,54,60,61,70,74,77,78,111,124,130,165,181,184,187,203,222,248,316,338,373,401,445,544,600,648,671,775,808,899,964,1047,1123,1185,1399,1676,2295,2482,2924,3245,3289,6334,7941],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,2.330690080046114,1.3195384777338066,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.094675786251684,1.9486336368009016,1.9463902258768238,2.0064197866819473,2.1183455303375887,2.2323930368088845,2.2642139034199635,2.448847599972298,4.888457308232007,2.496249838866882,4.946432381978511,2.569760528637609,2.5771019354959765,8.068514201337647,2.878207028279898,2.9720957437368454,3.0316467233633775,3.0879275592619675,3.241201430615691,3.4222967456864013,3.558633189238533,3.6105180246075443,3.6466665387238555,3.753391311073496,3.8023521382691974,4.197121957260614,4.062925891962901,4.140259095366071,4.390138803171316,4.235066888824737,4.436351646326448,4.770124825978496,5.521540914662417,5.501738287366237,5.373120909544144,5.521540914662417,5.541743621979936,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.961081561776376E-5,6.914141361437297E-5,6.967892217548886E-5,6.927631662084447E-5,6.927745163529587E-5,6.918061560218981E-5,6.938636844609201E-5,6.915136952614992E-5,6.930684701350879E-5,0.33208799711152515,0.47155759847435025,6.903974396954179E-5,7.032833655412626E-5,0.05715871233949142,6.90900870306287E-5,6.889915183964175E-5,0.08570973670337012,6.939286942506513E-5,6.917757831799758E-5,6.923491423085921E-5,6.990480263313641E-5,6.94616201989722E-5,6.954071279134301E-5,6.961563510975098E-5,7.01498993444019E-5,6.978303511953873E-5,7.271658134768238E-5,6.906026885240103E-5,6.906211637632352E-5,6.923708485761558E-5,7.070870288768721E-5,6.938884870084591E-5,0.048270228602690826,6.958402929276554E-5,6.913543784932502E-5,6.94545434695495E-5,6.906616241291803E-5,6.

{"value":"I just watched this movie on Starz. Let me go through a few things i thought could have been improved; the acting, writing, directing, special effects, camera crew, sound, and lighting. It also seemed as though the writers had no idea anything that had to do with the movie. Apparently back in 2007, when the dollar was stronger you could buy a super advanced stealth bomber that could go completely invisible for $75 million. Now-a-days those things cost about $3 billion and they cant go invisible. Apparently you can fly from the US to the middle east in an hour. There was a completely random lesbian scene, which I didn't mind, but it seemed like a lame attempt to get more guys to see it. The camera would randomly zoom in on actors and skip to random scenes. Oh yeah, since its a Steven Segal movie, its predictable as hell.

{"value":"This is a very bad movie. I laughed once or twice, and the storyline sucks! There is maybe one funny joke, it is stupid and it is boring. Through the whole short movie, I was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end.<br /><br />No one acts human, and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous. Rob Schneider acting like an animal isn't something I would pay to see. It looked funny, but the bottom line: DON'T WASTE YOU'RE PRECIOUS TIME ON SUCH A RIDICULOUS AND STUPID MOVIE.<br /><br />I was wondering when it was going to end, even though it is a short movie. In the beginning we thought it would get better; but it gets worse. Stupid, all the way to the end. I walked out of the theater, and I would remember that movie as extremely bad forever.<br /><br />The writer and co-producer of this film is a Simpsons TV writer, but this is nothing like The Simpsons

{"value":"This movie is awful. At the end of it you will realize that several hours have been stolen from your life that you can't get back. The \"twist\" ending is very contrived. The character development leading up to this ending is not consistent with their final actions at the conclusion. Ninety minutes of preparation-- with the premise that the Rob Lowe character will die on Christmas Eve-- is explained away in literally ninety seconds of \"No we were just tricking you.\" Then the Rob Lowe character is not even upset about it! \"I will forgive you if you can forgive me,\" is as upset as he gets. If someone took weeks to convince me I was about to die and then said \"No, sorry , just fooling you\" I would raise some serious hell. I don't feel bad about giving away the spoiler because I might be able to save some of you out there from watching.

{"value":"The Class is a comedy series that portrays a bunch of 27-year-old former class mates.<br /><br />I like the idea of the show. That's why it saddens me that The Class is not funny, even though it has the obvious potential. It's not enough corky, just dorky. (Haha.) This is due to a slowish tempo and the lack of actually hilarious punch lines. Also some actors have difficulties with timing.<br /><br />Most inventively written characters are the twins Kat and Lina Warbler (Lizzy Caplan and Heather Goldenhersh) but even they seem just a little too square for the good of the show. On the other hand the characters I find most uninteresting are the main character Ethan and the used-to-be- couple Duncan and Nicole.<br /><br />What bothers me with the series is that the only Latino

{"value":"I own 2 home entertainment stores and I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one was so bad it compelled me to register here and comment on it. How bad was it? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola deserved an Oscar for her performance in Godfather III when compared to Giada Colagrande's in this movie.<br /><br />It was robotic and uninspired. Her lover has just died one month prior to her arrival at the 'Rubber House' he had given her. Once there, she discovers he has cheated on her throughout her relationship but none of it seems to register with her. Within a day, she starts a relationship with Leslie, (Dafoe) the caretaker of the house. Even though she is married to Dafoe off screen, her scenes with him were cold and unemotional.<br /><br />If there was a plot, I missed it.

{"value":"This is a decent endeavor but the guy who wrote the screenplay seems to be a bit in the dark as to what exactly makes a zombie movie cool. No, it isn't CGI bugs and software companies. Actually I'm not sure whether it was a software company - I saw it without subtitles so I had to guess what they're talking about. Anyway my point was - instead of wasting your time animating some dumb-ass bug, why not throw in more zombies and more action. 2/3 of the 20 minutes consist of news bulletins, bugs, some guys yelling about something. And to makes matters worse (more boring) most of the deaths occur off-screen. I realize that's all too common for no-budget movies, but then there were some very impressive effects (well, kind-a of) which left me wondering why did the director (or screenwriter, whatever) chose

{"value":"the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable, but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it. keeping his great 30 days TV series in mind but also counting in his MTV production \"i bet you will\" that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production \"supersize me\" i did not had my hopes up high. sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less. as with \"supersize me\" after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was. the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re-repeating stuff that were already

{"value":"Some people have made a point of dissing this movie because they question the plausibility of black people in the Old West, Asian people in the Old West or women with guns in the Old West period. Get a grip and read a book. There were quite a few Asians (Chinese), there were quite a few blacks (freedmen) and everybody outside of the gentile class had ready access to guns; it is the second amendment you know. And as far as the use of modern language goes, none of those Westerns people have waxed nostalgic about actually used language that was consistent with the era depicted. Americans had different accents, used different inflections, spoke at a very different pace and used plenty of words and phrases that would be unrecognizable today. Don't blame historical inaccuracy for the fact that you just didn't dig it. Be honest.

{"value":"I might have given this movie a higher rating before Peter Jackson's trilogy came out, but seeing the two of them side by side there is simply no comparison. The pace of this movie is rushed, many important scenes from the book are left out, and there is little character development. The animation is a strange mixture of traditional cartoon drawings and live action scenes that were painted over, which I found distracting. And the most disappointing thing about this movie is that it breaks off in the middle of the story and was never finished. There are some good points- the battle scenes are exciting to watch, and the dialogue follows the book pretty much to the letter. Watch this one if you're in a hurry and can't spend 10 hours watching the new trilogy.

{"value":"Remember the name Kevin Lime - and please, please never let<br /><br />him direct again. Timing, pacing, editing: all hopelessly wrong.<br /><br />Three or four decent professionals (next time, guys, walk off the<br /><br />set) can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like Alice<br /><br />Evans, and the kind of production standards you'd expect from<br /><br />teen-produced children's shows on british TV.<br /><br />Greatest mystery: the music. A score so inept, inappropriate and<br /><br />ill-matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it is<br /><br />a case of sabotage. Add an acoustic that booms apparently<br /><br />unengineered from a single mike, and a director who only<br /><br />intermittently remembers to add auditory action offscreen, and we<br /><br />have

{"value":"No ,I'm not kidding. If they ever propose a movie idea, they should be kicked out of the studio. I'm serious. Their movies are exactly the same in every one, and they only consist of traveling to foreign locations, having a problem which they easily resolve, hoping to be popular, and getting new boyfriends. Think about it. If you have ever seen a movie starring them with a different plot, contact me and tell me its name. These \"movies\" are poor excuses to be on TV and go to other countries. There is a reason that the movies never go to theaters. I'm sure that when they were really young and made some O.K. movies, some studio boss bought all their rights for 15 years, or something, so that now that they're, what, 17, they can make movies in other countries whenever they want using the studio's money. Let me advise you, STAY AWAY FROM MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY!

{"value":"This movie is suppose to be a mysterious, serious thriller about a man looking for a missing girl. However, 30 minutes into the movie, it turns into a funny, unrealistic story with annoying characters and random scenes. I can't imagine anyone not laughing when Cage randomly Karate kicks that blonde girl or when he \"bear\" punches that old lady. The lines, characters, and acting are all poorly done from the get-go. I've always liked Nicolas Cage as an actor, but he has made some terrible movies this year; this being by far the worst one (yet...).<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an intense story-gripping thriller. If you really want to enjoy this story, go rent the original. However, if you intend on watching it, get ready to laugh at some of the lines and end scenes rather than taking them seriously; that's the only way you enjoy this

{"value":"Is there a book titled \"How to Make a Movie with Every 'Man vs. Nature' Cliché Imaginable\"? If not, Ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects. Ants doesn't have one shred of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. I suppose the most surprising thing about Ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes, and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases, much better. It's amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because they're all basically the same movie.<br /><br />And can someone please tell me what in God's name Myrna Loy is doing in this monkey-turd of a movie?

{"value":"Well, I have to say, this movie was so bad that I would have walked out if i didn't have to review it for work. ANd the worst part is, I wanted to see it so badly that I drove all over the city, paid $10 parking two times because the newspaper listings were wrong. Vince Vaughn plays the guy he always does -- the only time I've seen him play someone else was in that movie with John Travolta. Anyways, the plot has potential -- it sounded great in the preview, but it is filled with totally ridiculous, predictable, weak plot turn points. And I was hoping that this would be one Christmas movie where Christmas DIDN\"t have to be saved, and that Santa didn't need a replacdmetn, but nope. The only cool part was the sleigh rides, and the little bladck kid was the best character. I'm sure this movie would be great for young kids, but for adults it's so lame that it's chore to sit

{"value":"I just finished reading a book about Dillinger. This movie was horribly inaccurate. It's like they got a list of names and just made everything up. His robberies and getaways were well planned, down to the second - when the time was up, they left whether they had all of the money or not. They had notes of every road, where to turn, etc. Purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left. Purvis never even SAW Dillinger before the night Dillinger was killed, only photos of him. The way his gang members died were fictitious. Dillinger never robbed a bank by himself, like he did in this movie. If I had never read the book, maybe I could have enjoyed the movie. The acting was a bit over the top in places. The action was overdone as well.

{"value":"The closing song by Johnny Rivers was the only great thing about this movie. Unfortunately that is all the positive I can say about this western movie. I have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted, but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western. I am not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along, or just a spoof. The hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic. Not realistic at all. A lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic, but the shooting scenes were a joke. A previous commentator thought this movie was great, and in the comments took a cheap shot at President Bush. This was not a democratic or republican western. It was just a bad western movie to be sold commercially. I wonder if it made any money. At times I thought I was watching a movie made by college movie students.

{"value":"Kojak meets the mafia. Telly Savales is one of those guys from the past that seems pretty forgettable. I never thought that his show was all that great. This is his one dimensional characterization of a crime boss, with very predictable results. If you take the car chases and the general rambling out, there isn't much plot development or action. I find mafia movies to be dull because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions. Hollywood, and in this case, the Italian cinema, treat these guys as heroes. I saw the film and in a few days I won't remember much about it. Lots of shooting, innocent bystanders dying, betrayal, and that sick loyalty. The film is photographed pretty well and the acting is decent. But the dubbing is so bad (due to voices that just couldn't come out of those bodies), that I almost started looking for Godzilla approaching the

{"value":"I rented this film to see what might be a bloody, non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action-drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard. Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and as Lou saves Reb from the gooks, he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever. The Vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard, I swear! Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and him live together and own a bar. Super homoerotic. Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes on a killing spree to get him back. There is no good fight scenes at all, the punches are two inches away from a person. Characters personalities change in matter of seconds. One guy is a bad and in the next scene he's good. The acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental Frank Stallone sounding song that would make you sick.

{"value":"Don't let the name of this film deceive you, In reality Jake Speed the character is quite possibly the laziest action hero ever known to film. When Jake Speed is not saving virgin girls from evil madmen, which he is often not, he's seriously relaxing. Perhaps this adds to his charm, but in my opinion an action hero is not suppose to \"chill out\" whenever he gets the chance. Furthermore, unlike other daring heros who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has none, unless of course you call sleeping a talent. Anyhow, this movie is basically worthless, the writing is sub par and the action, when there is some, is very lame. (The machine guns on the jeep weren't bad, but that's about it) So, if you're in the mood to watch a movie that is a cure for insomnia, then this piece is perfect for you - It has a hero that not only

{"value":"I was interested in the topic, and only fans of Drew Barrymore's dancing on David Letterman's desk will find anything remotely interesting in it. OK, she shows some breast (or maybe a body double does). The plot is slashed to bits and the acting is horrible. Neither lead has any material to work with, as the direction of the film leads nowhere. Don't waste your time. See Donnie Darko instead if you want a creepy Drew Barrymore film, and if you want to see another, skip this and see Darko again.<br /><br />The treatment of the Doppelganger legend is absolutely criminal as well. Refer to Charles Williams' novel \"Descent Into Hell\" for something worth considering instead. This is just an excuse to make a B film to go straight to video and suck some life out of people at Blockbuster.<br /><br />What makes any of these people think the acting here was praiseworthy?

{"value":"This show is just annoying!!! I feel sorry for the actors for having to attempt to be funny (especially Bob Saget), the laugh track tries to cover up the sad jokes and the \"Awwww\" track comes up at the most unnecessary times. The over-dramatic kids are no exception, especially the Olsen twins. Also, this show is cliché city. If you were to look up the word cliché, it would read \"Full House\" Every story line has a \"life lesson\" to be learned at the end. A sappy speech makes everything better and even has the ability to make the most bratty child have a sudden realization of goodness GASP too bad this couldn't be possible in real life. I don't know how someone could watch this show without bad mouthing the behavior of the characters or the laugh track. i find myself yelling at the TV saying, \"THAT Isn't FUNNY/SAD/CUTE\" If life

{"value":"I didn't expect much when I saw this at the Palm Springs Film Fest this weekend. It was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out. Still, I held out hope. It sounded a bit much like \"Bride and Prejudice\" (L.A. guy falls for an Indian beauty, parental conflict, blah blah blah). B&P was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable characters.<br /><br />\"My Bollywood Bride\" had none of that. The acting seemed stilted and way to by-the-numbers. Characters were so cliché the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student. Technically, the sound really bothered me. It seemed as if there was a lot of over-dubbing of dialogue. I mean a lot.

{"value":"I only rented this movie because of promises of William Dafoe, and Robert Rodriguez. I assumed that upon seeing RR's name on the cover (as an actor) that this movie would be good. It sounds like a movie that Rodriguez would of made so if He's going to lend his name to it, than it has to be good right? WRONG WRONG WRONG. By far the worst editing since \"Manos Hands of fate\". The way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore. I have no idea how Dafoe and Rodriguez got involved in this film, maybe they owed somebody, but they are way to good for this. Besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and Rodriguez didn't even talk.

{"value":"I wasn't terribly impressed with Dante's 1st season offering in \"Homecoming\", it wasn't much of a horror story, but rather a smart political statement with the undead. Screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes men's sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women. The episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists. Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home. I assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak, but is unclear because this is never revisited. The episode go ons for a while introducing characters blah blah blah.It seems cool and mysterious but the episode stars to get worse and worse as it lurches forward until its sad and unsatisfying end. The worst episode.

{"value":"This version is pretty insipid, I'm afraid. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood, but William Hurt's weary, throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored, petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt! I also can't believe that they eliminated Edward's great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book, one of the most moving moments in literature. I do appreciate that they finally used such a young, plain woman to play Jane, a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18, but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel, please see the 70's version with George C. Scott and Susannah York.

{"value":"This is an OK film but lacks any real depth either emotionally or in terms of story telling.<br /><br />The story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none, also no real suspense.<br /><br />Washington is believable in the lead but he is sleep walking through it, there is no scope to flex any acting muscles for him or the supporting cast.<br /><br />The story simply falls a little flat, even having never heard of the title character the ending was obvious but unlike other films about such injustices this one has no emotional impact, you don't really care about him and the motivations of those on the outside helping seem more academic than concerned for his welfare.<br /><br />There is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy outside

{"value":"Yes, Marie Dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running.<br /><br />Dresler is good. Never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen.<br /><br />I watched this for Polly Moran, whom I've seen elsewhere. Here, Moran is OK -- just OK -- as Dressler's shrewish friend/foe. Too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion.<br /><br />The plot is good hearted. Bad guys try to rob the townspeople. Dressler triumphs and all ends well.<br /><br />I do wonder about the central plot mechanism: bonds. This came out during the Depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly. I, however, not of that era, am vaguely familiar with them. They're like stocks only different, right?

{"value":"Just looking at the sets, staging and editing it is easy to tell this project lacked a proper budget. Maybe Bela Lugosi is meant to take your mind off of things like that. Young brides drop dead at the altar after saying \"I do\". Their corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist Dr. Lorenz(Lugosi)and a couple of his freakish minions as his aging wife(Elizabeth Russell)needs injections of the glandular fluids of the young virgins to remain forever young...forever beautiful. An eager local cub reporter(Luana Walters)realizes that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar; an orchid in which Dr. Lorenz would be most knowledgeable. A typical horror movie storm brews making a visit to the Lorenz estate a bit spooky; especially with a dwarf and a slobbering hunchback on the premises.

{"value":"it MIGHT have been a good movie if it had explored something more interesting rather than just the surface of a lesbian relationship if this was the meaning of the movie...it is quite predictable not mentioning that the two girls resemble the Russian group t.A.T.u....coincidence? i don't think so. There is nothing original in this movie to support it so they had to use something which is already famous.You know the recipe. The other actors...well,i just don't know what their role is supposed to be. Most of them are well - known people in Romania and i must mention some of them are not even actors(e.g.Mihaela Radulescu).SO to summarize it: \"girl band tatty\"+desperate/publicity needing

{"value":"I saw this movie not knowing anything about it before hand. The plot was terrible with large gaps of information missing. The movie didn't have the \"battle of wits\" feel to me. The actors just spewed out mouthful's of nonsense, at times causing me to gnash my teeth in agony as they droned on and on. The plot was predictable except for the stomach sickening homo erotic scene at the end (I'm not homophobic but made me physically sick to my stomach), even the ending was predictable. And you could tell the detective was Jude Law in a costume, everything from the fake accent, terrible dental work, costume shop facial hair, everything pointed to it being a disguise. The whole movie just felt like wasted time out of my life. This movie had the feel of a puppet show with Jude Law and Michael Caine as puppets and the house as the window to view the show, really boooring in my opinion.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","movi","not","know","anyth","about","it","befor","hand","the","plot","be","terribl","with","larg","gap","of","inform","miss","the","movi","do","not","have","the","battl","of","wit","feel","to","me","the","actor","just","spew","out","mouth","of","nonsens","at","time","caus","me","to","gnash","my","tooth","in","agoni","a","thei","drone","on","and","on","the","plot","be","predict","except","for","the","stomach","sicken","homo","erot","scene","at","the","end","i","be","not","homophob","but","make","me","physic","sick","to","my","stomach","even","the","end","be","predict","and","you","can","tell","the","detect","be","jude","law","in","a","costum","everyth","from","the","fake","accent","terribl","dental","work","costum","shop","facial","hair","everyth","point","to","it","be","a","disguis","the","whole","movi","just","feel","like","wast","time","out","of","my","life","thi","movi","have","the","feel","of","a","puppet","show","with","jude","law","and","michael","cain","a","puppet","and","the","hous","a","the","window","to","view","the","show","realli","booor","in","my","opinion"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","know","anyth","befor","hand","plot","terribl","larg","gap","inform","miss","movi","battl","wit","feel","actor","spew","mouth","nonsens","time","caus","gnash","tooth","agoni","thei","drone","plot","predict","except","stomach","sicken","homo","erot","scene","end","homophob","make","physic","sick","stomach","even","end","predict","tell","detect","jude","law","costum","everyth","fake","accent","terribl","dental","work","costum","shop","facial","hair","everyth","point","disguis","whole","movi","feel","like","wast","time","life","thi","movi","feel","puppet","show","jude","law","michael","cain","puppet","hous","window","view","show","realli","booor","opinion"],"filtered2":["see","know","anyth","befor","hand","plot","terribl","larg","gap","inform","miss","battl","wit","feel","actor","spew","mouth","nonsens","time","caus","gnash","tooth","agoni","drone","plot","predict","except","stomach","sicken","homo","erot","scene","end","homophob","make","physic","sick","stomach","even","end","predict","tell","detect","jude","law","costum","everyth","fake","accent","terribl","dental","work","costum","shop","facial","hair","everyth","point","disguis","whole","feel","like","wast","time","life","feel","puppet","show","jude","law","michael","cain","puppet","hous","window","view","show","realli","booor","opinion"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,8,13,19,24,26,28,32,41,43,48,66,75,79,89,90,104,111,166,193,213,233,235,255,312,337,453,466,538,559,564,639,776,778,786,813,851,905,941,970,1029,1044,1063,1212,1367,1431,1824,1908,2194,2228,2263,2276,3082,3317,3338,4107,4476,4619,7362],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,8,13,19,24,26,28,32,41,43,48,66,75,79,89,90,104,111,166,193,213,233,235,255,312,337,453,466,538,559,564,639,776,778,786,813,851,905,941,970,1029,1044,1063,1212,1367,1431,1824,1908,2194,2228,2263,2276,3082,3317,3338,4107,4476,4619,7362],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,1.8837873718108231,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,2.6420723132238515,1.3324924169710188,3.0904588387038183,2.742262257014735,1.5687599167621034,4.982433610865464,1.6955116224012472,1.929723173391612,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,2.0728240170322856,2.1183455303375887,4.884774065938707,5.035680942918498,2.8432628718938773,2.6102777977348763,2.6457189377809835,2.6754694156628323,2.8824835850471584,5.947318931426056,3.2872346624216657,3.4446025032006995,3.43462735814388,3.5727776966246974,3.469984576472117,3.616452760127359,7.541206879909234,3.8059428063999263,3.900174431363043,3.8204358137024927,3.857614816944247,3.9121030022283168,3.9612932464190886,4.086456389373095,8.560544651185568,4.125296222689358,4.327618446189983,4.550761997504193,4.477736862489302,4.520909034354511,9.597669863721855,5.444579873526289,5.089758498236879,5.039114765418124,10.398914830986607,5.064116067623542,5.501738287366237,5.695894301807195,5.604922523601468,5.822646007446338,6.032366538428407,12.511020179485236,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.050896585481128E-5,5.016837209002001E-5,5.0558383345011584E-5,5.0266256467427613E-5,5.0267080023446343E-5,5.0196816690855526E-5,5.034610905691902E-5,5.017559600779101E-5,5.028840903879071E-5,0.45589143202200166,0.16447087490892368,5.0094601533337456E-5,0.12354783966059149,5.175754077823327E-5,5.0131129994193705E-5,4.999258918043573E-5,5.123959178194374E-5,5.0350826107309286E-5,5.019461286545575E-5,5.0236215275071015E-5,5.072228012198998E-5,5.04007110348302E-5,5.04580998904552E-5,5.051

{"value":"Just finished this movie... saw it on the video shelf and being a Nick Stahl fan I just had to rent it. In all honesty, it probably should have stayed on the shelf. The concept was an interesting one and there were several fairly smart twists and turns but somehow I guessed almost all of them before they came along. And the movie just went a little too far in the end in my opinion... if you have to suffer through a viewing of it you'll see what I mean!<br /><br />On a positive note, Nick Stahl's acting was great (especially considering what he had to work with). Eddie Kaye Thomas was also good but he always plays the same type of character... too much Paul Finch from \"American Pie\" coming through for my liking.<br /><br />And finally, the worst part of this movie has to be January Jones' emotionless performance...
