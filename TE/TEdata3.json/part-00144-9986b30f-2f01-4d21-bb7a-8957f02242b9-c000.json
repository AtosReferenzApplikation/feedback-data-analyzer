{"value":"Besides all of the technical mistakes ....<br /><br />How about a female flight attendant who's able to kill, all by herself, 4 out of the 7 terrorists (including ex marines), 2 of whom without even using a gun. Then, she lands the plane perfectly. We're not talking about Sigourney Weaver or Linda Hamilton; we're talking about a regular, frightened, yet very well composed flight attendant. :D How about the leader in charge of the assault/rescue squad, having a full-proof (according to the logic of the script) plan of sleep-gassing everyone and having someone from his team fly the plane. Only he decides at the spur of the moment to change plans and instead lead an attack on the terrorists, guns blazing, not knowing where the terrorists are, or how many, and not securing a position of advantage, so that his whole team gets easily wiped out. Yeah, that's using the old noggin. Only later to decide to use the sleep gas anyway. And it turns out useless for all intensive purposes.<br /><br />Bad as this movie was, though, I couldn't stop myself from watching and wondering, what next? :D I can't help but imagine all the excellent, unemployed script writers thinking to themselves, it's not fair. lol!

{"value":"I noticed \"Fire\" was on cable the other night and I began watching it because I couldn't recall anything specific about it other than I remember it being a horrible film when I saw it back in '85. Twenty years later the film is still awful. Besides the synthesizer, the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s, as is evident in the title song. Hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them. And to compound this musical assault Rob Lowe's character played saxophone, and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was Charlie Parker, only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo. All the characters were intensely unappealing, although I must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them. Actually I thought Mare Winningham was appealing, and I initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear, but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with Rob Lowe's character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon.","finished_norm":["i","notic","fire","be","on","cabl","the","other","night","and","i","begin","watch","it","becaus","i","can","not","recal","anyth","specif","about","it","other","than","i","rememb","it","be","a","horribl","film","when","i","see","it","back","in","twenti","year","late","the","film","be","still","aw","besid","the","synthes","the","saxophon","be","the","much","abus","instrum","in","pop","music","dure","the","a","be","evid","in","the","titl","song","hear","that","song","again","make","me","want","to","jab","a","screwdriv","in","my","ear","to","end","the","sonic","miseri","inflict","upon","them","and","to","compound","thi","music","assault","rob","lowe","charact","plai","saxophon","and","there","be","on","scene","where","he","plai","a","solo","that","go","on","and","on","like","he","be","charli","parker","onli","hi","shrill","tone","and","plai","be","much","reminisc","of","a","monkei","plai","a","kazoo","all","the","charact","be","intens","unapp","although","i","must","sai","thei","do","a","great","job","of","cast","equal","unapp","actor","to","portrai","them","actual","i","think","mare","winningham","be","appeal","and","i","initi","feel","sorri","for","her","charact","becaus","she","wear","funni","underwear","but","then","near","the","end","of","the","movi","she","decid","to","have","sex","with","rob","lowe","charact","who","would","probabl","be","vote","much","like","to","transfer","a","varieti","of","sexual","diseas","if","such","thing","be","vote","upon"],"filtered":["notic","fire","cabl","night","begin","watch","becaus","recal","anyth","specif","rememb","horribl","film","see","back","twenti","year","late","film","still","aw","besid","synthes","saxophon","much","abus","instrum","pop","music","dure","evid","titl","song","hear","song","make","want","jab","screwdriv","ear","end","sonic","miseri","inflict","upon","compound","thi","music","assault","rob","lowe","charact","plai","saxophon","scene","plai","solo","go","like","charli","parker","onli","hi","shrill","tone","plai","much","reminisc","monkei","plai","kazoo","charact","intens","unapp","although","must","sai","thei","great","job","cast","equal","unapp","actor","portrai","actual","think","mare","winningham","appeal","initi","feel","sorri","charact","becaus","wear","funni","underwear","near","end","movi","decid","sex","rob","lowe","charact","probabl","vote","much","like","transfer","varieti","sexual","diseas","thing","vote","upon"],"filtered2":["notic","fire","cabl","night","begin","watch","becaus","recal","anyth","specif","rememb","horribl","see","back","twenti","year","late","still","aw","besid","synthes","saxophon","abus","instrum","pop","music","dure","evid","titl","song","hear","song","make","want","jab","screwdriv","ear","end","sonic","miseri","inflict","upon","compound","music","assault","rob","lowe","charact","plai","saxophon","scene","plai","solo","go","like","charli","parker","onli","shrill","tone","plai","reminisc","monkei","plai","kazoo","charact","intens","unapp","although","must","great","job","cast","equal","unapp","actor","portrai","actual","think","mare","winningham","appeal","initi","feel","sorri","charact","becaus","wear","funni","underwear","near","end","decid","sex","rob","lowe","charact","probabl","vote","like","transfer","varieti","sexual","diseas","thing","vote","upon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,7,10,11,12,19,22,24,29,37,40,41,43,51,52,57,62,63,64,92,104,118,138,141,147,148,150,210,216,230,237,239,249,254,264,289,290,328,437,469,514,519,551,555,630,688,689,906,952,967,972,1015,1184,1190,1226,1350,1490,1535,1559,1572,1583,1666,1700,1789,2023,2190,2436,2438,2607,2619,2751,3215,3764,4115,4230,4327,4483,4835,5147,5176,6080,7844],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,7,10,11,12,19,22,24,29,37,40,41,43,51,52,57,62,63,64,92,104,118,138,141,147,148,150,210,216,230,237,239,249,254,264,289,290,328,437,469,514,519,551,555,630,688,689,906,952,967,972,1015,1184,1190,1226,1350,1490,1535,1559,1572,1583,1666,1700,1789,2023,2190,2436,2438,2607,2619,2751,3215,3764,4115,4230,4327,4483,4835,5147,5176,6080,7844],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,4.495548096411346,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.312380678011735,2.5958480334723544,2.6420723132238515,1.3195384777338066,1.4876543214774305,6.513987503328295,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,1.834162586674748,2.0226120445069267,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,2.0489535369135887,2.0728240170322856,4.70875905096179,2.2907365189289424,2.2657547357741192,2.2844323215331563,2.30186540

{"value":"Okay, let me coin a new word here: polyphobia: The fear of polyamorous relationships. This is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by titillating audiences about some kind of threesome, only to turn on a dime and go all preachy about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamistic solution. Only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person, and this director is not one of them. Bleh.<br /><br />Mark my words: a few decades from now, polyphobia is going to be just as big a faux-pas as homophobia, but guess who was too close-minded to realize this? Right the first time: the producers of this movie. And so many like it. Why even make a ridiculously conservative and old-fashioned type of movie like this? Priding itself on being limitlessly open-minded about gayness, it completely overlooks the fact that we live in an age where monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy, which in turn in turning into swinging and polyamory.

{"value":"Contrary to most other comments about \"Syriana\" on the IMDb web-site, I and my family found watching this film on DVD at home a complete waste of time and space.<br /><br />In short, this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far. Rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner, it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30-second vignettes of different story-lines from a dozen or so \"story-lines\" at the audience made for great and clear viewing. No, sir, it does not. What does make for great viewing is total clarity, precision, plots and story-lines - and characterisations - which have a beginning, a middle, and an end.<br /><br />This kind of cinematic presentation - akin to the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant - is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme.<br /><br />Thank goodness, then, for the TV and DVD presentations of the Hollywood and British film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers, director, and actors knew the value of clear story telling, diction, and acting that meant something.<br /><br />This is one DVD

{"value":"As I am not a blood and guts fan I found the gory scenes totally unnecessary (you spell it) and too real for my liking, if you're the type of person who gets their rocks off on beheadings on the internet or snuff movies I say go for it, it beggars belief what sort of person dreams this sick crap up though.<br /><br />Apart from that it had the potential to be a great movie, the music was top class too (through the movie and especially the end credits). Some parts though were a bit unbelievable, like you've just been found by your girlfriend trust up awaiting torture and death and all you do is tell her about what had happened and how you got there, (why didn't he ask her if she happened to have any wipes or even some air freshner or a piece of gum while he was at it?), come on now, most would probably just scream \"hurry up and untie me then lets get the f*** out of here QUICK!\". where were the flys, maggots etc, and when the girl accidentally came across the place surely the stench of rotten flesh would have sounded a few alarm bells! I would only recommend this movie to friends of Dennis Niellson and the like, I'm sure a video like this would make sickos like that have a very happy

{"value":"Silly, often ridiculous romp involving the landing of a space ship and the resulting havoc this causes on Tim (Jeff Daniels) and the people in his orbit.<br /><br />Am always amazed by Daniels. He showed such depth and promise in 1983's \"Terms of Endearment\" as Shirley MacLaine's philandering son-in-law. As the years have passed, Daniels has been unable to get his hands on a good, meaty role. Instead, he is in inane comedies such as \"Dumb and Dumber.\"<br /><br />As for this picture, it fails because of the subject matter. At least, the television show brought about a variety of situations. In the film, we have constant slapstick and people turning into monsters as the government is thwarted into capturing the martian-Martin.<br /><br />The part of Mrs. Brown is a perfect example of the non-success of the film. On television, Pamela Britton portrayed a ditsy individual caught up in situations with the martian leaving her perplexed. In the film version, a blond bomb-shell as Brown, tries romantic entanglement.<br /><br />Television star Ray Walston has a small role as a government agent, or is he really that?<br /><br />A very

{"value":"While I watched this movie, I tried to figure out why they bothered making it. Though the main plot of the movie is potentially good, there are all sorts of unrelated/unnecessary subplots. The marketing people in Hollywood must have dictated the multiple bad guys, perpetual double-crosses and the man and woman who get too close and have sex. It's odd that we see more of them having sex than we did of the President and his mistress. The many plots and subplots make the film too broad and none of the characters are properly developed - I really didn't feel like I knew any character, except that everyone is corrupt and evil. The ending is totally incomplete - it left me more than just wanting what might have been, but what was supposed to be. In the end, there is really no explanation of why anyone does what they do, except to serve as additional corrupt characters who commit a double-cross. I'm surprised that so many established (and good) actors agreed to make such a hollow movie. This seemed like a movie made by college students who are working on their 2nd or 3rd project.<br /><br />Don't waste your time unless you are in a film class and want an example of what not to do

{"value":"I know, I know, \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" is the worst movie, or maybe \"Manos, the Hands of Fate.\" But I can't get worked up over those sock-monkey movies. Of *course* they're bad. How could they be any good? But if you're talking about movies with respectable production values and bankable talent, the T. rex of all turkeys has to be \"Yentl.\" All the treacly phoniness, all the self-absorbed asininity, that stains everything Barbra Streisand has done since 1964, reaches its culmination in this movie. From its lonely summit of awfulness, \"Yentl\" looks back to \"A Star is Born\" and forward to \"The Mirror Has Two Faces.\" There is nothing else quite like it. What emotional undertow dragged Streisand out to make this movie I would rather not speculate, and what audience she was playing to I cannot possibly imagine, although I'll bet there's a nine in ten chance you aren't a member of it.<br /><br />Nobel Prize-winner and saintly guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so outraged by what Streisand did to his story that he blasted her in public for it. It is a tribute to Streisand's impenetrable vulgarity that she not only didn't commit suicide, but went on to make more awful

{"value":"Ok, I first saw this movie like at 9:00 on Cinemax a few weeks ago and thought it would be award winning, boy was I 180d on that. This movie bit the big one. I mean, the mother of the monsters shows her true form only at the end of the movie. I'm going \" That's it? Why doesn't she show it briefly a little bit more earlier in the movie.\" The plot being the mother and son feast on the blood of young women. Wouldn't it be better if they just went on, you know, a killing spree killing like a couple of young women each, then having the sheriff or a cop find out about and get into the old find a way to kill the monsters,save the young woman/women, and have 1 or 2 more people killed in the process? I think it would be a hell of a lot better that way. It also sucks because the son is the main character and he gets killed first. Why not get rid of the mother first? Plus, how does she have that strength at the end of the movie when she starts killing people? She said it herself she was too weak. What the heck was wrong with Stephen this time? I can never, ever dis the acting on any movie by any actor, after all, they try their best. If it weren't for good acting, I'd have given this movie a 1/10.

{"value":"The 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke-out about their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity, and drug use were all part of the daily fabric, and the daily news. This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie, and largely succeeded.<br /><br />In this film, two families are followed: one white, one black. During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family. Admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and the story lines are intermingled, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century.<br /><br />On the whole, the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie. The movie is a work of fiction, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided.","finished_norm":["the","be","a","time","of","chang","and","awaken","for","much","peopl","social","upheav","and","unrest","be","commonplac","a","peopl","spokeout","about","their","view","racial","tension","polit","the","vietnam","war","sexual","promiscu","and","drug","us","be","all","part","of","the","daili","fabric","and","the","daili","new","thi","film","attempt","to","encapsul","thi","histor","aspect","into","a","entertain","movi","and","larg","succeededbr","br","in","thi","film","two","famili","be","follow","on","white","on","black","dure","the","half","of","the","film","the","stori","follow","each","famili","on","a","equal","basi","through","social","and","famili","struggl","unfortun","the","half","of","the","movi","be","nearli","dedic","to","the","white","famili","admittedli","there","be","much","charact","in","thi","famili","and","the","stori","line","be","intermingl","but","equal","consider","be","not","give","to","the","racial","aspect","of","thi","centurybr","br","on","the","whole","the","act","be","good","do","and","histor","footag","be","mix","with","color","and","black","and","white","origin","footag","to","give","a","documentari","feel","to","the","movi","the","movi","be","a","work","of","fiction","but","clip","of","wellknown","histor","figur","be","us","to","set","the","timelinebr","br","i","enjoi","the","movi","but","the","situat","be","predict","and","the","storylin","be","onesid"],"filtered":["time","chang","awaken","much","peopl","social","upheav","unrest","commonplac","peopl","spokeout","view","racial","tension","polit","vietnam","war","sexual","promiscu","drug","us","part","daili","fabric","daili","new","thi","film","attempt","encapsul","thi","histor","aspect","entertain","movi","larg","succeededbr","br","thi","film","two","famili","follow","white","black","dure","half","film","stori","follow","famili","equal","basi","social","famili","struggl","unfortun","half","movi","nearli","dedic","white","famili","admittedli","much","charact","thi","famili","stori","line","intermingl","equal","consider","give","racial","aspect","thi","centurybr","br","whole","act","good","histor","footag","mix","color","black","white","origin","footag","give","documentari","feel","movi","movi","work","fiction","clip","wellknown","histor","figur","us","set","timelinebr","br","enjoi","movi","situat","predict","storylin","onesid"],"filtered2":["time","chang","awaken","peopl","social","upheav","unrest","commonplac","peopl","spokeout","view","racial","tension","polit","vietnam","war","sexual","promiscu","drug","us","part","daili","fabric","daili","new","attempt","encapsul","histor","aspect","entertain","larg","succeededbr","two","famili","follow","white","black","dure","half","stori","follow","famili","equal","basi","social","famili","struggl","unfortun","half","nearli","dedic","white","famili","admittedli","charact","famili","stori","line","intermingl","equal","consider","give","racial","aspect","centurybr","whole","act","good","histor","footag","mix","color","black","white","origin","footag","give","documentari","feel","work","fiction","clip","wellknown","histor","figur","us","set","timelinebr","enjoi","situat","predict","storylin","onesid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,10,17,21,23,30,43,47,48,56,61,69,87,107,109,111,177,182,195,200,206,227,229,239,260,278,312,314,337,359,415,473,515,519,564,575,611,624,645,658,697,783,842,875,886,906,916,953,975,1563,1981,2034,2051,2426,2757,2884,3034,3646,3888,4517,5638,6986,7924],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,10,17,21,23,30,43,47,48,56,61,69,87,107,109,111,177,182,195,200,206,227,229,239,260,278,312,314,337,359,415,473,515,519,564,575,611,624,645,658,697,783,842,875,886,906,916,953,975,1563,1981,2034,2051,2426,2757,2884,3034,3646,3888,4517,5638,6986,7924],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,2.729695454751562,2.6728839783437044,1.6608112036218214,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,3.7221218701403576,1.8818517047392527,2.127032521151058,2.115024371522662,2.1439533986393955,2.125691139326857,2.1183455303375887,2.458149992634611,13.682648362120393,2.51289241584188,2.5308211829319704,5.194609285626992,2.6005321873043625,5.6865257437877545,2.6593400337329487,5.3509388313256645,2.8336934208777267,2.8824835850471584,3.189397019426827,2.973659465713028,9.656867465005114,3.1588018988486244,3.335489637924323,3.3956930001684253,3.5614461306151473,3.469984576472117,3.6314455447135003,3.520060914452293,3.9241755834625858,7.117266378477066,7.626326108746826,3.7952092507568174,3.7568101178222815,3.8883864756110005,3.9282323841582003,3.944626193933877,7.816221961917559,4.100845126825194,12.390777036094462,8.1729127

{"value":"Bela Lugosi is not typecast in this fantastic twelve-part adventure serial, playing the lead as Frank Chandler/Chandu the Magician, enjoying his role as a representative of the forces of White Magic pushed against those of Black, while displaying vigourous fighting skill, successfully wooing a young Egyptian princess, and cutting a lean and dashing figure in yachting gear, complete with nautical cap. The somewhat lumpy plot engages Chandler/Chandu in an ongoing series of escapades pointed at achieving the rescue of his fiancee, Princess Nadji(Maria Alba) and others from the clutches of the idol-worshipping sect of Ubasti, which covets Nadji's blood in order to revivify an ancient mummified princess entombed upon the mysterious island of Lemuria. Director Ray Taylor, an old hand at such entertainments keeps events moving briskly, but repeated scenes and footage, a good deal of which is to be found in the previous year's Skull Island setting from KING KONG, and the port locale from SON OF KONG, reduces original action to less than 60 minutes from the serial's running length of over two and one-half hours and, if viewed at one sitting,

{"value":"I bought this movie because this was Shah rukh khans Debut.And i also liked to see how would he do.I must say he is excellent in his role.Divya Bharathi is superb in this movie.Rishi does a wonderful job.Susham Seth supported well.Alok nath was good in his role.Amrish and Mohnish did their parts well too.Dalip also was good in his small role.Actors shine in a Mediocre movie.The direction is average.The editing is poor.The story is boring.It tells us about Ravi a famous pop singer.He has a lot of female fans.One of them is Kaajal.Ravi and Kaajal fall in love and get married.Ravi gets killed by his cousins.Kaajal becoems a widow..To escape from Ravis cousins.They go to Bombay.She comes across Raja.She falls in love with him and gets married.Ravi returns.The story is predictable.The climax is predictable.The first half bores.It also drags a lot.But it is saved by the actors and music.The second half entertains.The music is catchy with some nice songs.The cinematography looks outdated in the first half but it looks unimaginative.The song picturisations are dull except for \"Sochenge Tumhe Pyar\" and one rain song.The costumes are outdated.Any way watch this just for the

{"value":"The 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people. Social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke-out about their views. Racial tensions, politics, the Vietnam War, sexual promiscuity, and drug use were all part of the daily fabric, and the daily news. This film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie, and largely succeeded.<br /><br />In this film, two families are followed: one white, one black. During the first half of the film, the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles. Unfortunately, the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family. Admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and the story lines are intermingled, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century.<br /><br />On the whole, the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie. The movie is a work of fiction, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided.","finished_norm":["the","be","a","time","of","chang","and","awaken","for","much","peopl","social","upheav","and","unrest","be","commonplac","a","peopl","spokeout","about","their","view","racial","tension","polit","the","vietnam","war","sexual","promiscu","and","drug","us","be","all","part","of","the","daili","fabric","and","the","daili","new","thi","film","attempt","to","encapsul","thi","histor","aspect","into","a","entertain","movi","and","larg","succeededbr","br","in","thi","film","two","famili","be","follow","on","white","on","black","dure","the","half","of","the","film","the","stori","follow","each","famili","on","a","equal","basi","through","social","and","famili","struggl","unfortun","the","half","of","the","movi","be","nearli","dedic","to","the","white","famili","admittedli","there","be","much","charact","in","thi","famili","and","the","stori","line","be","intermingl","but","equal","consider","be","not","give","to","the","racial","aspect","of","thi","centurybr","br","on","the","whole","the","act","be","good","do","and","histor","footag","be","mix","with","color","and","black","and","white","origin","footag","to","give","a","documentari","feel","to","the","movi","the","movi","be","a","work","of","fiction","but","clip","of","wellknown","histor","figur","be","us","to","set","the","timelinebr","br","i","enjoi","the","movi","but","the","situat","be","predict","and","the","storylin","be","onesid"],"filtered":["time","chang","awaken","much","peopl","social","upheav","unrest","commonplac","peopl","spokeout","view","racial","tension","polit","vietnam","war","sexual","promiscu","drug","us","part","daili","fabric","daili","new","thi","film","attempt","encapsul","thi","histor","aspect","entertain","movi","larg","succeededbr","br","thi","film","two","famili","follow","white","black","dure","half","film","stori","follow","famili","equal","basi","social","famili","struggl","unfortun","half","movi","nearli","dedic","white","famili","admittedli","much","charact","thi","famili","stori","line","intermingl","equal","consider","give","racial","aspect","thi","centurybr","br","whole","act","good","histor","footag","mix","color","black","white","origin","footag","give","documentari","feel","movi","movi","work","fiction","clip","wellknown","histor","figur","us","set","timelinebr","br","enjoi","movi","situat","predict","storylin","onesid"],"filtered2":["time","chang","awaken","peopl","social","upheav","unrest","commonplac","peopl","spokeout","view","racial","tension","polit","vietnam","war","sexual","promiscu","drug","us","part","daili","fabric","daili","new","attempt","encapsul","histor","aspect","entertain","larg","succeededbr","two","famili","follow","white","black","dure","half","stori","follow","famili","equal","basi","social","famili","struggl","unfortun","half","nearli","dedic","white","famili","admittedli","charact","famili","stori","line","intermingl","equal","consider","give","racial","aspect","centurybr","whole","act","good","histor","footag","mix","color","black","white","origin","footag","give","documentari","feel","work","fiction","clip","wellknown","histor","figur","us","set","timelinebr","enjoi","situat","predict","storylin","onesid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,10,17,21,23,30,43,47,48,56,61,69,87,107,109,111,177,182,195,200,206,227,229,239,260,278,312,314,337,359,415,473,515,519,564,575,611,624,645,658,697,783,842,875,886,906,916,953,975,1563,1981,2034,2051,2426,2757,2884,3034,3646,3888,4517,5638,6986,7924],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,10,17,21,23,30,43,47,48,56,61,69,87,107,109,111,177,182,195,200,206,227,229,239,260,278,312,314,337,359,415,473,515,519,564,575,611,624,645,658,697,783,842,875,886,906,916,953,975,1563,1981,2034,2051,2426,2757,2884,3034,3646,3888,4517,5638,6986,7924],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.5541073880211935,1.162015545335049,2.729695454751562,2.6728839783437044,1.6608112036218214,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,3.7221218701403576,1.8818517047392527,2.127032521151058,2.115024371522662,2.1439533986393955,2.125691139326857,2.1183455303375887,2.458149992634611,13.682648362120393,2.51289241584188,2.5308211829319704,5.194609285626992,2.6005321873043625,5.6865257437877545,2.6593400337329487,5.3509388313256645,2.8336934208777267,2.8824835850471584,3.189397019426827,2.973659465713028,9.656867465005114,3.1588018988486244,3.335489637924323,3.3956930001684253,3.5614461306151473,3.469984576472117,3.6314455447135003,3.520060914452293,3.9241755834625858,7.117266378477066,7.626326108746826,3.7952092507568174,3.7568101178222815,3.8883864756110005,3.9282323841582003,3.944626193933877,7.816221961917559,4.100845126825194,12.390777036094462,8.1729127

{"value":"Maddy (Debbie Rochon) is a mentally unstable young woman with a troubled past who gets more than she bargained for when she goes to a pool party with a handsome coworker. When her date and his friends jokingly say they belong to a `Murder Club,' Maddy takes it seriously and moves straight up to `Level 3' by bashing in the brains of a woman in a parking garage (for denting her car!). But is Maddy also the one donning a plastic mask and killing off other members of the group or has someone else lost it?<br /><br />The plot of this film (originally titled MAKE 'EM BLEED) is very poorly conceived, full of holes and spirals completely out of control before a ludicrous, out-of-left-field twist ending. Some of the dialogue is downright laughable. I didn't have a problem with Rochon's performance, but the supporting cast was atrocious. However, I managed to sit through this Full Moon release thoroughly entertained. There's plenty of skin and blood and it's the perfect type of flick to sit around with a group of your buddies and pick apart. Horror fans may also enjoy the cameos from Brinke Stevens and Lloyd Kaufman (as Debbie's parents) and Julie Strain (an early victim).<br /><br />Score: 4 out of

{"value":"I had high hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed. The film was directed so badly it made my stomach ache. The pacing was so slow, the dialogue laughable and the film - well apart from a nice fight scene between Achilles (Pitt) and Hector (Bana) - the rest was shallow.<br /><br />And why, oh why does Hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit 'consumer approval'. Agamemnon didn't die in Troy, the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUTSIDE the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle! It annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap.<br /><br />And don't even start me on the 'lack' of chemistry between Helen and Paris. She was the woman the war was fought over and it didn't even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other. No sparks, no emotion, no hope.<br /><br />I have to say in the films defence Brad Pitt, Eric Bana and Peter O' Toole acted very well with a bad script but that isn't enough to save this awful movie. <br /><br />Can anybody tell me where the £200 million budget went? Maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral pyres - where did they get all those trees?<br /><br />I am so disappointed it hurts.","finished_norm":["i","have","high","hope","for","troi","and","i","be","so","bitterli","disappoint","the","film","be","direct","so","badli","it","make","my","stomach","ach","the","pace","be","so","slow","the","dialogu","laughabl","and","the","film","good","apart","from","a","nice","fight","scene","between","achil","pitt","and","hector","bana","the","rest","be","shallowbr","br","and","why","oh","why","doe","hollywood","alwai","insist","on","rewrit","stori","to","fit","consum","approv","agamemnon","do","not","die","in","troi","the","war","last","year","and","achil","be","kill","by","pari","outsid","the","wall","of","troi","with","a","arrow","to","the","ankl","it","annoi","me","that","such","a","classic","stori","a","thi","be","turn","into","a","soapbr","br","and","do","not","even","start","me","on","the","lack","of","chemistri","between","helen","and","pari","she","be","the","woman","the","war","be","fight","over","and","it","do","not","even","look","a","if","the","two","of","them","care","a","great","deal","about","the","other","no","spark","no","emot","no","hopebr","br","i","have","to","sai","in","the","film","defenc","brad","pitt","eric","bana","and","peter","o","tool","act","veri","good","with","a","bad","script","but","that","be","not","enough","to","save","thi","aw","movi","br","br","can","anybodi","tell","me","where","the","million","budget","go","mayb","in","all","the","tree","thei","us","for","the","funer","pyr","where","do","thei","get","all","that","treesbr","br","i","be","so","disappoint","it","hurt"],"filtered":["high","hope","troi","bitterli","disappoint","film","direct","badli","make","stomach","ach","pace","slow","dialogu","laughabl","film","good","apart","nice","fight","scene","achil","pitt","hector","bana","rest","shallowbr","br","oh","doe","hollywood","alwai","insist","rewrit","stori","fit","consum","approv","agamemnon","die","troi","war","last","year","achil","kill","pari","outsid","wall","troi","arrow","ankl","annoi","classic","stori","thi","turn","soapbr","br","even","start","lack","chemistri","helen","pari","woman","war","fight","even","look","two","care","great","deal","spark","emot","hopebr","br","sai","film","defenc","brad","pitt","eric","bana","peter","o","tool","act","veri","good","bad","script","enough","save","thi","aw","movi","br","br","anybodi","tell","million","budget","go","mayb","tree","thei","us","funer","pyr","thei","get","treesbr","br","disappoint","hurt"],"filtered2":["high","hope","troi","bitterli","disappoint","direct","badli","make","stomach","ach","pace","slow","dialogu","laughabl","good","apart","nice","fight","scene","achil","pitt","hector","bana","rest","shallowbr","oh","doe","hollywood","alwai","insist","rewrit","stori","fit","consum","approv","agamemnon","die","troi","war","last","year","achil","kill","pari","outsid","wall","troi","arrow","ankl","annoi","classic","stori","turn","soapbr","even","start","lack","chemistri","helen","pari","woman","war","fight","even","look","two","care","great","deal","spark","emot","hopebr","defenc","brad","pitt","eric","bana","peter","o","tool","act","veri","good","bad","script","enough","save","aw","anybodi","tell","million","budget","go","mayb","tree","us","funer","pyr","get","treesbr","disappoint","hurt"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,6,9,15,16,17,18,19,21,47,51,56,57,70,71,76,77,90,93,96,102,138,144,163,181,183,187,189,197,205,211,226,232,234,248,256,262,271,293,300,314,332,390,448,468,506,546,552,572,676,760,791,807,863,994,1085,1132,1209,1351,1824,1894,1914,1990,2442,2470,2565,3035,3081,3150,3529,3555,3969,4251,5765,7153,7231,7975],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,6,9,15,16,17,18,19,21,47,51,56,57,70,71,76,77,90,93,96,102,138,144,163,181,183,187,189,197,205,211,226,232,234,248,256,262,271,293,300,314,332,390,448,468,506,546,552,572,676,760,791,807,863,994,1085,1132,1209,1351,1824,1894,1914,1990,2442,2470,2565,3035,3081,3150,3529,3555,3969,4251,5765,7153,7231,7975],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,2.094675786251684,1.9214926742550966,2.1337665533324026,1.9463902258768238,2.0477128419653545,2.035389827120098,2.0390708128715254,2.087553710177271,2.2907365189289424,2.2931108769894046,2.4000574358028657,2.4442286541160034,2.4885128563647294,4.946432381978511,2.498193474075453,2.558331832813986,2.571852579609833,2.5687161421197025,2.5940874818617203,5.675566812258503,2.673149229007135

{"value":"I saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf. And before i got my first VCR I figured I'd christen it with this little gem and it's bad film-making at it's finest!<br /><br />The dialog is inadvertently hilarious. And it contains a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is in it inexplicably. And much like Christopher Walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years. This movie is Mr. Quinn's Country Bears.<br /><br />It features lines like, \"Shut up and let me FIGHT!!!\"<br /><br />And \"You're saying a lot of sh_it!\" <br /><br />And the priceless comeback: \"Unfortunately it is sh_it, tough angry sh_it!\"<br /><br />You'll be awed by a fight scene as Bo does a SOMMERSAULT across a billiard table! And does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll! Chop socky action and T and A thrills!!!<br /><br />What schlock movie fan could ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt Bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness?

{"value":"Casting aside many of the favorable comments that have obviously come from friends and/or relatives that pepper this and many other low budget independents listed on IMDb, one is lost when it comes to using these reviews as an accurate gauge. So eventually you have to go out and rent the flick just to see for yourself. One of the first things you must understand are the catch phrases that camouflage the reality of the movie. In this case the term \"dark psychological thriller.\" Read: \"hack writer/director who thinks he's an auteur, who replaces plot, story, and action, with what he believes is a deep insight into the human soul. His great insight? Festering and repressed childhood traumas emerge to wreck havoc when we become adults. Wow, I bet Freud would be really impressed! Too many would be film makers like Kallio, who were raised on low budget horror flicks of the last few decades, fail to dig their own fresh grave. Instead, they fall into the pre-dug graves of the many other directors that came before them. They are content with rehashing old and tired horror clichés that they borrowed from a dozen or more films. The result is an unoriginal, uninspired, unbelievable waste of film

{"value":"No laughs whatsoever. Yes, I watched this entire train wreck but only so that I wouldn't later wonder if Cleese had come to his senses in the latter part. (No, he had not.) <br /><br />This may be historically interesting to you youngsters out there, to see that British \"humor\" included black \"jokes\" like these, thirty years ago. <br /><br />What amazes me even more though, is to read the other reviewers' comments, which acknowledge this isn't very good, yet then turn around and give it high votes. If the vast majority of the comedies that you have seen are even much worse than this one, then I certainly pity your torturous existences. <br /><br />The humor level of this show appears aimed at little kids, yet the subject matter does not. So who is this for? People who enjoy repeated & drawn-out double-takes, pratfalls, drug jokes (interesting only as a short trip back to '77), and other \"low\" humor. The Three Stooges are still funny, and were to me as a kid, too. THEY exerted some effort in making jokes work. This however is sloughed off schlock. I fear that it IS the end of civilization, if this stuff really is accepted as worthwhile. Next you'll be telling me that tabloid TV is popular.

{"value":"Alexandre Aja's remake of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the bright spots of 2006. Not only was it a remake of a classic horror film, but it was pretty damned good too. So, nearly a year later, we are being treated to the sequel to that remake. While original scripter Wes Craven is back as producer and co scripted, this film just fails to rise to the level set by the original and the remake. A group of military trainees stop by in the desert to check in on some scientists and find themselves run afoul of the mutant family from the first film (at least those that remain plus some new ones). There's plenty of gore to be had here. What annoys me about this film is the utter lack of characterization. The viewer does not give a damn about what happens to any of these people because we haven't gotten into them. Even the mutants had some characterization last time out and this time, nothing. Gore for the sake of gore is pointless. There has to be a reason for this to happen for it to be interesting. Nothing that happens here is interesting. And what is it lately with rape scenes in films? Here we get yet another one for no real reason.

{"value":"Or listening to, for that matter. Even the soundtrack is a bore. <br /><br />Honestly, this isn't the worst gay movie I've seen (that would be Regarding Billy), but it's down there very close to the bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />This thing drags and drags and drags. It's not that the plot is inane--in the hands of a good writer it might have worked . . . it certainly could have been much more entertaining. There's not one plot point you can't see coming for ten miles down the road. The dialog is flat. The jokes are old. To add insult to injury, it's full of one-dimensional, stereotypical gays. <br /><br />Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible, much less real. There was no chemistry, no dynamic, in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other . . . we're just told they're in love. Hard to figure when they have nothing in common and aren't compatible sexually. They like the same book? Huh?<br /><br />The acting is not totally bad, but the pacing is excruciatingly slow. I mean, almost Jarmusch- slow, but without Jarmusch quality. In fact, that would be a good barometer for you.

{"value":"The only possible way to enjoy this flick is to bang your head against the wall, allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain, let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded, perhaps then you *MIGHT* enjoy this film.<br /><br />The only saving grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl. Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it a 3 rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy.<br /><br />Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted needlessly. Plus the scene at Heathrow of the re-union was just too much to digest. Being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, Anil Kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But then again the point of the movie was to defy logic, gravity, physics and throw an egg on the face of the *GENERAL* audience.<br /><br />Watch it at your own peril.

{"value":"Overall this movie is dreadful, and should have never been made. One of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters, for example, if she is about to be attacked, you want to feel, \"Oh My God, No!\", but you don't in this case, you don't care because there is no link that has been made to know the character. In the trailer, it seemed as though the movie would be great, yet there is no suspense what so ever really. There could have been maybe some mystery but there is not. \"All she has is a toolbox.\" was said on the DVD's back, you would think that it was carefully planned this movie, and cleverly made, but it is not, The ending, was just awful, very straight forward, and pointless too. The acting is either average or below average, maybe even lower. In my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life. The \"Special Effects\" and sets were average too, nothing special what so ever. There is not much gore, or bloody violence, not much blood is shown. This movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing, yet really, its not even worth looking for, I do not recommend this to anyone, unless they are easily satisfied, by a few fights and a boring story.","finished_norm":["overal","thi","movi","be","dread","and","should","have","never","be","make","on","of","the","problem","with","thi","movi","be","that","there","be","no","link","to","the","audienc","and","the","charact","for","exampl","if","she","be","about","to","be","attack","you","want","to","feel","oh","my","god","no","but","you","do","not","in","thi","case","you","do","not","care","becaus","there","be","no","link","that","have","be","make","to","know","the","charact","in","the","trailer","it","seem","a","though","the","movi","would","be","great","yet","there","be","no","suspens","what","so","ever","realli","there","can","have","be","mayb","some","mysteri","but","there","be","not","all","she","have","be","a","toolbox","be","sai","on","the","dvd","back","you","would","think","that","it","be","carefulli","plan","thi","movi","and","cleverli","make","but","it","be","not","the","end","be","just","aw","veri","straight","forward","and","pointless","too","the","act","be","either","averag","or","below","averag","mayb","even","low","in","my","opinion","it","be","a","wast","of","a","hour","of","my","life","the","special","effect","and","set","be","averag","too","noth","special","what","so","ever","there","be","not","much","gore","or","bloodi","violenc","not","much","blood","be","show","thi","movi","be","advertis","to","make","it","sound","quit","amaz","yet","realli","it","not","even","worth","look","for","i","do","not","recommend","thi","to","anyon","unless","thei","be","easili","satisfi","by","a","few","fight","and","a","bore","stori"],"filtered":["overal","thi","movi","dread","never","make","problem","thi","movi","link","audienc","charact","exampl","attack","want","feel","oh","god","thi","case","care","becaus","link","make","know","charact","trailer","seem","though","movi","great","yet","suspens","ever","realli","mayb","mysteri","toolbox","sai","dvd","back","think","carefulli","plan","thi","movi","cleverli","make","end","aw","veri","straight","forward","pointless","act","either","averag","averag","mayb","even","low","opinion","wast","hour","life","special","effect","set","averag","noth","special","ever","much","gore","bloodi","violenc","much","blood","show","thi","movi","advertis","make","sound","quit","amaz","yet","realli","even","worth","look","recommend","thi","anyon","unless","thei","easili","satisfi","fight","bore","stori"],"filtered2":["overal","dread","never","make","problem","link","audienc","charact","exampl","attack","want","feel","oh","god","case","care","becaus","link","make","know","charact","trailer","seem","though","great","yet","suspens","ever","realli","mayb","mysteri","toolbox","dvd","back","think","carefulli","plan","cleverli","make","end","aw","veri","straight","forward","pointless","act","either","averag","averag","mayb","even","low","opinion","wast","hour","life","special","effect","set","averag","noth","special","ever","gore","bloodi","violenc","blood","show","advertis","make","sound","quit","amaz","yet","realli","even","worth","look","recommend","anyon","unless","easili","satisfi","fight","bore","stori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,10,12,13,15,16,17,21,22,24,26,28,35,37,42,43,44,49,51,63,75,86,89,106,108,109,120,138,158,163,167,168,174,178,194,203,205,207,217,219,232,234,247,288,298,307,352,355,358,403,412,452,460,495,529,534,538,548,581,583,643,685,699,950,995,1179,1530,1685,2250,3650,5557,6478],"values":[4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,10,12,13,15,16,17,21,22,24,26,28,35,37,42,43,44,49,51,63,75,86,89,106,108,109,120,138,158,163,167,168,174,178,194,203,205,207,217,219,232,234,247,288,298,307,352,355,358,403,412,452,460,495,529,534,538,548,581,583,643,685,699,950,995,1179,1530,1685,2250,3650,5557,6478],"values":[2.479906862482093,1.852034211452262,2.247774048205673,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,3.209458785004948,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,1.8729627573220065,1.9742250248702675,2.031112399272319,1.9940046109572438,2.159084361316692,2.138507503627933,2.125691139326857,2.2044500422972613,2.2907365189289424,2.3106972614914807,4.800114871605731,2.4609576687888097,2.4894767118610357,2.456282578459816,2.532833256045391,5.075762444685391,5.139521057275218,2.571852579609833,2.5531798379045583,2.6113665294700725,2.5792094178355414,2.8377834061292515,2.673149229007135,2.7303758068497004,2.8015621426949333,2.7819920465008363,2.8767855639325206,3.1236456418640466,3.185521045582134,3.2030824725120812,3.189397019426827,3.107414446

{"value":"To heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story, it's set in a special ward for \"difficult cases.\" The main story is Loretta Young's; she's on leave from a long prison stretch for murder. Will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life, or heed her husband's plea for the opposite? Melodrama and sentiment are dominant, and they're not the honest sort, to say the least. For example, just to keep things moving, this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward, and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babies.<br /><br />There are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a Warners film, mostly from Glenda Farrell, who swigs gin from her hot-water bottle while she waits to have twins that, to her chagrin, she finds there's now a law against selling. An example of her repartee: \"Be careful.\" Farrell: \"It's too late to be careful.\" Aline MacMahon is of course wonderfully authoritative as the chief nurse, but don't expect her to be given a dramatic moment.<br /><br />The main theme of the film is that the sight of a baby turns anyone to mush.

{"value":"I just watched this movie today and not only is it, terrible and awful but it looks like the director just got a few friends together to make a movie about a sick man. I also think that this movie has the look of a porn video with it's clear crisp just filmed view.<br /><br />Thank heavens I work in a video store and I didn't have to pay for it cause this movie is crap x infinity..DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS MOVIE!!!!! You'd have a better time watching Dude Where's My Car than this piece of crap! And that's not saying a lot for that movie either.<br /><br />The acting is lousy and the movie is just very unwatchable. I was watching this movie and I wanted to kill myself during and after the movie.<br /><br />I walked home and threw up after watching this piece of dirt movie, I then took a shower and burnt my clothes. <br /><br />If I had half a mind I would of took the movie outside and burned it too cause no one should be subjected to it...well maybe members of Al Queda..especially the ones we have in

{"value":"Before the release of George Romero's genre-defining Night of the Living Dead, zombies were relatively well-behaved creatures. They certainly had much better table-manners in the old days. But social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie-going public? Judging by this film, none whatsoever.<br /><br />The story is about an expedition to Cambodia, whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication. One of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army.<br /><br />This film is basically a love triangle with zombies. But seeing as this is a 30's movie, the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh-eating variety we think of today. They seem to respond to mind-control, rather than insatiable appetites. And, quite frankly, the 'revolt' is somewhat underwhelming too. The whole thing is really very dull. Aside from the lack of horror, there isn't any over-the-top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained. It seems unlikely that this could've provided much entertainment even 70 years ago.

{"value":"Oh dear... as an Englishman, and a small part Welsh, a fan of Anthony Hopkins' work in the industry..... to date, I am truly disappointed. <br /><br />You see I am a nobody, who hoped for better. So my comments are as 'straw in the wind'. But, that's the point isn't it? - I have no axe to grind on the commercial value of a work. I, a full member of the great unwashed, go to see a movie to be transported to another place. To yes, suspend belief for a brief period. But not to enter a state of total disbelief.<br /><br />Had this been by an unknown author and director, I would guess that this 'production' would have been castigated into oblivion. Unfortunately, its not, and I was left wide eyed and confused. Having seen some of the rave reviews given this work I am faintly worried....<br /><br />Perhaps its that I try, without prejudice, to view each movie on its own merits. Regardless of author, director, studio or even the notoriety of the content.<br /><br />My advice, as many before me: Don't Write and Direct the same production. It is fraught with danger.

{"value":"There seems to be a surprisingly high number of 8-10 star reviews here from people who have never written an IMDb review before or since. Given the very low average rating given to the film by other people, I think you may draw your own conclusions.<br /><br />This is a very bad film. I'll admit it, I thought the concept was kind of cute, and I was pleased to see the actresses who played Eve and Harmony on Angel getting work, but it didn't take long for the sheer awfulness of this film to make itself known.<br /><br />Acting: The leads seemed competent enough, but everyone else? Terrible.<br /><br />Plot: Chock full of holes big enough to drive a truck through.<br /><br />Direction: Non-existent.<br /><br />Humour: Did they really think people were going to laugh? Oh boy.<br /><br />Eye Candy: OK. there were some really beautiful women in this film. Not just the three main female characters, but right across the board. It was as if the producers hoped the scenery would keep male viewers so distracted they wouldn't notice how terrible everything else was. If so, they failed miserably.<br /><br />In the right hands this could have been cute but darkly funny camp classic.

{"value":"Your first clue that this is a cheesy movie is that it was shot on video, not film. The story is convoluted, and the production is amazingly sloppy. Note, for example, that when the title couple are on a plane ostensibly landing in Vermont, where they've gone to celebrate their relationship in a civil union ceremony, the plane is shown coming into an airport surrounded by palm trees. Their ceremony - in Vermont - takes place in a garden of tropical plants, including palms, which wouldn't last five minutes in the New England climate. On yet another airplane trip, the establishing shot depicts a FedEx cargo plane taking off. Presumably they could only afford to travel in steerage. As for the plot, this movie expects you to believe that Victor, the devoutly Christian brother of Arthur, is kicked out of his church when the congregation learns that his BROTHER is gay. Not only that, but the pastor eventually sets Victor up with a hit man to have Ben and Arthur killed \"to purge their souls of sin.\" Apparently no one in this church has ever heard of the Ten Commandments. Were it not for Jamie Brett Gabel, who is surprisingly effective as Arthur, this movie would have no redeeming qualities at all.","finished_norm":["your","clue","that","thi","be","a","cheesi","movi","be","that","it","be","shoot","on","video","not","film","the","stori","be","convolut","and","the","product","be","amazingli","sloppi","note","for","exampl","that","when","the","titl","coupl","be","on","a","plane","ostensibli","land","in","vermont","where","thei","have","go","to","celebr","their","relationship","in","a","civil","union","ceremoni","the","plane","be","show","come","into","a","airport","surround","by","palm","tree","their","ceremoni","in","vermont","take","place","in","a","garden","of","tropic","plant","includ","palm","which","would","not","last","five","minut","in","the","new","england","climat","on","yet","anoth","airplan","trip","the","establish","shoot","depict","a","fedex","cargo","plane","take","off","presum","thei","can","onli","afford","to","travel","in","steerag","a","for","the","plot","thi","movi","expect","you","to","believ","that","victor","the","devoutli","christian","brother","of","arthur","be","kick","out","of","hi","church","when","the","congreg","learn","that","hi","brother","be","gai","not","onli","that","but","the","pastor","eventu","set","victor","up","with","a","hit","man","to","have","ben","and","arthur","kill","to","purg","their","soul","of","sin","appar","no","on","in","thi","church","have","ever","hear","of","the","ten","command","be","it","not","for","jami","brett","gabel","who","be","surprisingli","effect","a","arthur","thi","movi","would","have","no","redeem","qualiti","at","all"],"filtered":["clue","thi","cheesi","movi","shoot","video","film","stori","convolut","product","amazingli","sloppi","note","exampl","titl","coupl","plane","ostensibli","land","vermont","thei","go","celebr","relationship","civil","union","ceremoni","plane","show","come","airport","surround","palm","tree","ceremoni","vermont","take","place","garden","tropic","plant","includ","palm","last","five","minut","new","england","climat","yet","anoth","airplan","trip","establish","shoot","depict","fedex","cargo","plane","take","presum","thei","onli","afford","travel","steerag","plot","thi","movi","expect","believ","victor","devoutli","christian","brother","arthur","kick","hi","church","congreg","learn","hi","brother","gai","onli","pastor","eventu","set","victor","hit","man","ben","arthur","kill","purg","soul","sin","appar","thi","church","ever","hear","ten","command","jami","brett","gabel","surprisingli","effect","arthur","thi","movi","redeem","qualiti"],"filtered2":["clue","cheesi","shoot","video","stori","convolut","product","amazingli","sloppi","note","exampl","titl","coupl","plane","ostensibli","land","vermont","go","celebr","relationship","civil","union","ceremoni","plane","show","come","airport","surround","palm","tree","ceremoni","vermont","take","place","garden","tropic","plant","includ","palm","last","five","minut","new","england","climat","yet","anoth","airplan","trip","establish","shoot","depict","fedex","cargo","plane","take","presum","onli","afford","travel","steerag","plot","expect","believ","victor","devoutli","christian","brother","arthur","kick","church","congreg","learn","brother","gai","onli","pastor","eventu","set","victor","hit","man","ben","arthur","kill","purg","soul","sin","appar","church","ever","hear","ten","command","jami","brett","gabel","surprisingli","effect","arthur","redeem","qualiti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,11,17,28,31,32,34,44,45,59,73,76,87,91,106,109,117,130,144,164,190,194,216,240,253,264,301,307,308,319,381,388,430,505,543,545,560,577,634,640,684,716,854,869,870,1007,1011,1032,1038,1043,1088,1130,1275,1351,1406,1524,1536,1607,1772,1892,1967,1999,2001,2110,2132,2235,2287,2329,2345,2670,2819,2843,2959,3311,3562,4021,5038,5645,6177,6936,7202,7693],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,11,17,28,31,32,34,44,45,59,73,76,87,91,106,109,117,130,144,164,190,194,216,240,253,264,301,307,308,319,381,388,430,505,543,545,560,577,634,640,684,716,854,869,870,1007,1011,1032,1038,1043,1088,1130,1275,1351,1406,1524,1536,1607,1772,1892,1967,1999,2001,2110,2132,2235,2287,2329,2345,2670,2819,2843,2959,3311,3562,4021,5038,5645,6177,6936,7202,7693],"values":[0.9708269144703846,1.982619630677639,1.2770536940105968,1.5452294193519092,2.814133962290301,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,1.8693254449200722,1.8950689206770979,2.1337665533324026,2.115024371522662,2.0105926690411424,2.159084361316692,2.125691139326857,4.5594602370234405,2.2642139034199635,2.2931108769894046,2.3930275298746078,2.558331832813986,2.5378812223426954,2.6070186965339692,2.7666071276613566,2.7073305177318163,2.757740698455715,2.83097602790122

{"value":"I gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open-ended and left unexplained, and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way, plus scenes of a decaying corpse. <br /><br />Neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner.<br /><br />The film's plot, such as it is, concerns three loosely interconnecting stories, none of which conclude satisfactorily.<br /><br />The bounty hunter, played by Bruce Dern, is the character that connects all three vignettes.<br /><br />First we have Dylan McDermott, looking darn fine, as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to Mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter, when he rides through a border town and spots a sad-faced saloon girl played by Helen Hunt.<br /><br />Then we have one of the Hemingway girls, not sure which one, playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman, an attractive redhead, whom

{"value":"Although the production and Jerry Jameson's direction are definite improvements, \"Airport '77\" isn't much better than \"Airport 1975\": slick, commercial rubbish submerging (this time literally) a decent cast. Jack Lemmon is the pilot of a packed airliner which gets hijacked by art thieves and crashes into the sea (all the publicity claimed it was near the Bermuda Triangle, but there's no mention of it in the film itself). When the rescue ships come to raise the airplane out of the water, we see all their cranes dropping (rather blindly) into the ocean and it's hard not to laugh (imagining the cranes plugging the plane, the passengers and the waterlogged script). NBC used to air what appeared to be the \"director's cut\", with at least an hour of extra footage--mostly flashbacks--injected into the proceedings with all the subtlety of a \"Gilligan's Island\" episode. Most exciting moment is the plane crash, and some of the players have a little fun: Lee Grant is an obnoxious drunk, Brenda Vaccaro a no-nonsense stewardess, Joseph Cotten and Olivia de Havilland are flirting oldsters.

{"value":"Since \"Rugrats\"' falling from the category of good and funny cartoon series to a mediocre and indeed outright horrible fare for two year olds in the past three or four years, obviously the tyrants at Klasky-Csupo should be out of ideas. After dumbing down all of the characters, adding even stupider new ones, replacing some voices (though I like Nancy Cartwright, she is NOT Chucky Finster!), and having no sense of continuity (ex.: in a Kimi episode I watched the other day, Tommy and Chucky each got a new puppy; but it subsequent episode, the aforementioned dogs never appear), you'd think the creators could kill the show for mercy. But noooo.<br /><br />All I will say concerning this special is that it sucks! While not as horrible as the Kimi episodes, everyone is even stupider than they were, including Grandpa (my God! He used to be the best character on the show, but now, he has no real purpose). The ending is needlessly fluffy, and the only thing different between this and other crappy new episodes ('98-'01) is that the kids can interact with adults.

{"value":"Even though many people here praises this movie, I have to warn you. It has no logic whatsoever. I think that Basinger does a decent job at acting, but you can't make a thriller if there is a great lack of realism.<br /><br />This scene paints a good picture for you of the movie : while Basinger is pursued by murderous thugs she decides to sit down and gaze upon a picture she finds from her pocket. The picture is from her daughter and it reads \"we love you mommy\". Who does something like that ? What the eff? And believe me when I say that it is not nearly as stupid as some other scenes of the movie. Someone stated that this is a \"hidden gem\". Well, I have to strongly disagree, this movie has stayed hidden for a reason. And it's not a gem. Oh, and please, I don't even want to start commenting about the red toolbox. It hurts my brain :D Usually the lack of logic does not bother me if it is in small amounts, but this movie basically is made possible only because of the lack of logic. But, i still give it a 4 because even though it is embarrassingly flawed in logic, it has certain mood that kept me watching till the end.<br /><br />So if you choose to watch this, you know you have
