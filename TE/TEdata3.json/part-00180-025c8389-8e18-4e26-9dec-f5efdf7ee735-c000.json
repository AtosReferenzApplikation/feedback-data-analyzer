{"value":"Christopher Durang must have been taught by a memorably awful nun, because he just can't let go of the concept. The play, \"Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All For You,\" was presented -- at least in Hollywood -- in precisely the same tone as Diane Keaton's lecture scenes here. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a lampoon, a bitter satire of a serenely confident, doctrinaire and highly judgmental nun -- and as played by Lynn Redgrave, she was hilarious. But the movie insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously -- while, as mentioned, maintaining the same tone in the \"explains it all\" scenes. The two approaches clash headlong and in the last twenty minutes, the movie goes off the track, plunges into the gorge, and explodes. There are no survivors. It could have worked, if the tone of the scenes with the four former students, and their encounter with Sister Mary, been pitched the same as the Sister Mary scenes. Or if the Sister Mary scenes been presented more realistically. This way simply doesn't work at all.","finished_norm":["christoph","durang","must","have","be","teach","by","a","memor","aw","nun","becaus","he","just","ca","not","let","go","of","the","concept","the","plai","sister","mari","ignatiu","explain","it","all","for","you","be","present","at","littl","in","hollywood","in","precis","the","same","tone","a","dian","keaton","lectur","scene","here","sister","mari","be","a","exagger","a","lampoon","a","bitter","satir","of","a","seren","confid","doctrinair","and","highli","judgment","nun","and","a","plai","by","lynn","redgrav","she","be","hilari","but","the","movi","insist","that","we","take","thi","exagger","absolut","serious","while","a","mention","maintain","the","same","tone","in","the","explain","it","all","scene","the","two","approach","clash","headlong","and","in","the","last","twenti","minut","the","movi","go","off","the","track","plung","into","the","gorg","and","explod","there","be","no","survivor","it","can","have","work","if","the","tone","of","the","scene","with","the","four","former","student","and","their","encount","with","sister","mari","be","pitch","the","same","a","the","sister","mari","scene","or","if","the","sister","mari","scene","be","present","much","realist","thi","wai","simpli","doe","not","work","at","all"],"filtered":["christoph","durang","must","teach","memor","aw","nun","becaus","ca","let","go","concept","plai","sister","mari","ignatiu","explain","present","littl","hollywood","precis","tone","dian","keaton","lectur","scene","sister","mari","exagger","lampoon","bitter","satir","seren","confid","doctrinair","highli","judgment","nun","plai","lynn","redgrav","hilari","movi","insist","take","thi","exagger","absolut","serious","mention","maintain","tone","explain","scene","two","approach","clash","headlong","last","twenti","minut","movi","go","track","plung","gorg","explod","survivor","work","tone","scene","four","former","student","encount","sister","mari","pitch","sister","mari","scene","sister","mari","scene","present","much","realist","thi","wai","simpli","doe","work"],"filtered2":["christoph","durang","must","teach","memor","aw","nun","becaus","ca","let","go","concept","plai","sister","mari","ignatiu","explain","present","littl","hollywood","precis","tone","dian","keaton","lectur","scene","sister","mari","exagger","lampoon","bitter","satir","seren","confid","doctrinair","highli","judgment","nun","plai","lynn","redgrav","hilari","insist","take","exagger","absolut","serious","mention","maintain","tone","explain","scene","two","approach","clash","headlong","last","twenti","minut","go","track","plung","gorg","explod","survivor","work","tone","scene","four","former","student","encount","sister","mari","pitch","sister","mari","scene","sister","mari","scene","present","realist","wai","simpli","doe","work"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,14,18,19,22,31,33,40,47,48,59,81,124,138,141,144,201,222,285,300,371,395,411,585,606,626,632,725,867,896,921,959,967,1039,1074,1078,1112,1162,1274,1278,1288,1574,1912,1960,1992,2046,2184,2694,2859,2881,2887,3178,3426,3503,3588,4250,5304,5830,6029,6746],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,14,18,19,22,31,33,40,47,48,59,81,124,138,141,144,201,222,285,300,371,395,411,585,606,626,632,725,867,896,921,959,967,1039,1074,1078,1112,1162,1274,1278,1288,1574,1912,1960,1992,2046,2184,2694,2859,2881,2887,3178,3426,3503,3588,4250,5304,5830,6029,6746],"values":[1.9416538289407692,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,6.561903390058675,1.2979240167361772,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,3.2569937516641474,1.7064694353107215,3.3910232448024944,1.8693254449200722,1.949757232424728,2.2323930368088845,2.2907365189289424,2.2657547357741192,2.2931108769894046,2.561435818751577,2.5771019354959765,2.808171552082607,2.932274249550174,3.0466846007279185,6.306336162260736,6.458012315043746,18.582681093421705,3.584239140143704,3.6528204042982337,3.541919708264792,3.7034641371169887,3.8844878351953436,3.8844878351953436,21.7607977755305,4.067587905068712,12.331661822856464,4.105687751300982,4.110553940952155,4.186539847930077,4.268777946167049,4.383707912841026,5.243909178064138,4.535724120139652,4.403125998698128,4.573751515728891,4.838444069955973,4.9909126636002465,4.956227105612356,9.801928853874614,5.185068678041204,5.259176650194926,5.482320201509136,5.719991853386255,5.390512652256013,5.482320201509136,5.822646007446338,5.604922523601468,11.756431717202299,5.9370563586240825,6.2980697041614135,6.600350576034347,6.437831646536572,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.4985657968503752E-4,1.4972378419373142E-4,1.4976075215263786E-4,1.4973064545103923E-4,1.4974481568056725E-4,1.497229586619544E-4,1.4976952458074886E-4,1.497006823276665E-4,1.4972381583632261E-4,1.498785391

{"value":"During the cheap filmed in video beginning of Crazy Fat Ethel II, I wondered if it was the same film that was on the cover. Unfortunately, it was. The story itself is mindlessly simple. Ethel, a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder, is released into a halfway house because of hospital overcrowding. She is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into another's soup. Ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food. Ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and then....well, you get the idea. If this all sounds like fun, it isn't. This film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting. The characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store. To make matters worse, half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first Ethel movie, Criminally Insane, which is little better.

{"value":"This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is absolutely no storyline, the gags are only for retards and there is absolutely nothing else that would make this movie worth watching. In the whole movie Fredi (oh my god what a funny name. ha ha) doesn't ask himself ONCE how he came from a plane to middle earth. There are plenty of stupid and totally unfunny characters whose names should sound funny. e.g. : Gandalf is called Almghandi, Sam is called Pupsi ... and so on. I didn't even smile once during the whole movie. The gags seem like they were made by people whose IQ is negative. If you laugh when someone's coat is trapped in the door (this happens about 5 times) then this movie is perhaps for you. Another funny scene: They try to guess the code word for a closed door (don't ask why- don't ever ask \"why\" in this movie) and the code word is (ha ha): dung.

{"value":"Not to be confused with Lewis Teague's \"Alligator\" (1980) which actually IS an excellent film, this \"Il Fiume Del Grande Caimano\" laboriously ends the exotic trilogy Sergio Martino made around the end of the seventies (including the rather watchable \"L'Isola degli uomini pesce\" and the not so good \"La Montagna del dio cannibale\"). Tracing outrageously the plot of \"Jaws\", the script fails at creating any suspense what so ever. The creature is ludicrous and its victims are simply despicable. Stelvio Cipriani's lame tune poorly illustrates the adventures of these silly tourists presented from the very beginning as the obvious items of the reptile's meal. No thrill out of this, rather laughters actually! And we could find this pitiful flick quite funny if the dialogs and the appearance of the natives were not so obviously inspired by pure racism. Very soon the giggling stops in favor of a sour feeling witnessing such a patronizing attitude. We could excuse badly made films and poor FXs, but not that kind of mentality.

{"value":"How did this become a blockbuster? Dear God I don't know where to start why this movie sucked too much. The movie was predictable & there was no originality. The only thing I can admire is the acting of some characters. The movie was too bright, they should have done something with the lighting, eg. making the environment more darker. The make up on certain dead characters made this movie look like a 1970 horror flick. This is 2006! People don't get scared by other people wearing heavy make up. Most of the horror scenes we're taken from other Hollywood or Asian horror movies. Total rip off! This is why I don't watch tagalog movies. The only reason why so many people \"screamed\" while watching this movie is because of conformity. How many times do we have to copy scenes from The Ring and improvise it that instead of the girl coming out of the TV, its now coming from the window next door?

{"value":"Pretty poor Firestarter clone that seems more like a bad TV movie than a bad feature film. How disappointing for this to come from Hooper and Dourif!<br /><br />Government contractors do a human experiment with a Hydrogen bomb. The boy born to the couple from the experiment constantly runs a fever of 100 degrees, and when he's an adult, people in his life start spontaneously combusting. He tries to find out why.<br /><br />The people completely on fire are well done, but when they get to the point that they are well done in another sense, they're obviously changed to dummies. When jets of fire shoot out of characters' arms, it looks silly rather than alarming the way it should. Also ridiculous is fire that evidently travels through phone lines and erupts in huge jets from the receiver's earpiece. How is that supposed to happen, exactly?<br /><br />Something else that struck me as silly about the movie is when a character has visions of his late parents.

{"value":"Well, let me start off by saying how utterly HILARIOUS this film is, I simply couldn't keep myself from laughing at the sheer stupidity of it. Don't get me wrong, it IS well acted particularly by Bassinger but the script is just, well the mind boggles truly.<br /><br />The premise is good and up until Della actually witnesses the murder it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill . Half way through the film the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and of course instead of lobbing it at the guy's head, she decides to pull out a screwdriver, car jack and finally a flare (as in for a sinking ship) respectively to kill her victims.<br /><br />Then there is the final line that I promise, if it doesn't have you in stitches then I will eat my own left foot.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned, appalling film making.

{"value":"Just imagine the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been such a mumbling moron as Carlyle portrayed him in this film.<br /><br />Nobody would have followed him, not even a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1920s.<br /><br />This is just a Hollywood cardboard piece of propaganda itself, disguised as \"true history\".<br /><br />I pity everyone who actually believed anything from this show. Carlyle and the producers didn't get anything right with this.<br /><br />Why was Hitler able to win so many people, a whole county for his ideas if we was such a sausage? Why did people follow him to death? By portraying him as such a loser they make their own film totally unbelievable. This film is a mixture of old WW2 propaganda and MTV urban myths about one of the most important persons of the last century. Imagine a film about Churchill where the director only shows him as a drunkard for 90 mins. <br /><br />This film is a disgrace and I wonder how they could talk an actor like Carlyle into this

{"value":"The animation looks like it was done in 30 seconds, and looks more like caricatures rather than characters. I've been a fan of Scooby Doo ever since the series premiered in 1969. I didn't think much of the Scooby Doo animated movies, (I'm talking about the TV Series, not the full length movies.), but some of them were pretty cool, and I like most people found Scrappy Doo to be an irritant, but this series is pure garbage. As soon as I saw the animation, and heard the characters, (and I use that term loosely) speak, I cringed. Also, Mystery Inc., was a team, and without the entire crew to compliment each other, it just seems like opening up a box of chocolates to find someone has already ate the best ones, and the only thing left are the ones nobody wants. What's New Scooby Doo was better than this. If you're going to have a Scooby Doo TV series, include the elements that made the series endure so long. The entire cast of characters, and quality animation.

{"value":"It's impossible for me to objectively consider this movie. Not that I haven't tried, mind you - but I sit down, and I pop in the aged VHS, and I watch the opening...and suddenly I'm five years old again and clutching my very own Care Bear and watching the movie with open eyes and an eager heart.<br /><br />I can see, objectively, that this movie is a BIZARRE combination of cuddly baby merchandising-mascots and creepy prepubescent children with evil powers that has a thin story and uninteresting animation. But my inner five-year-old goes, \"Yay! Care Bears!\" every time I think about it. So - I'd only (cautiously, reluctantly) recommend this movie for those who saw it during their early youth and can call on the awesome power of nostalgia while watching it (like me) OR those lovably cynical Gen-X/Y-ers who deliberately seek out the wonderfully bad/strange (a category in which this movie...definitely belongs).

{"value":"I'm still trying to figure out if there was a point to this film.<br /><br />For content that's supposed to be so 'rebellious' and 'controversial' the things that Maddox distributes to the students are awfully lame. Students seem to be easily swayed by vague anti-authoritarian sentiments and snippets of words illegibly scrawled onto leaflets. Rebel, everybody.<br /><br />I suppose it would have been too much to ask to have a teenage rebellion film where a school fire alarm doesn't get set off.<br /><br />Apparently a 'huge fight up on the football fields' is a fight that consists of two people.<br /><br />Characters personalities seem to wildly vary at random. A football jock who Maddox was fighting (and who subsequently got a staple on the face) is all smiles and apologies the next day.<br /><br />The fact that it doesn't come to any real conclusion of the plot makes me feel that the whole thing could have been fitted into a half hour after school special.

{"value":"I suppose bad Laurel and Hardy is better than no Laurel and Hardy at all, but just barely. It's sad that the Fox films are the ones getting a big release on DVD, exposing people who may not be too familiar with L&H to their WORST stuff rather than their classic comedies.<br /><br />Once again the boys are saddled with a dumb romantic plot about a guy who's invented an invisible ray. He's in love with the bosses' daughter, who hates him and prefers some slick guy. It's incredible to think the geniuses at Fox thought THIS is what L&H needed in their films.<br /><br />Without their pancake makeup the boys look tired and old. The only scenes that work for them in this picture is when they try to sneak out of a bedroom window at night and the rather bizarre scene where Robert Mitchum, being a classic noir bad guy tries to sell Oliver Hardy \"insurance\" on Stan.<br /><br />Otherwise, this script is just a mess.

{"value":"Jeez, only in the 70's... Antonio Margheriti brings us this quirky hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick evolving around a treasure-hunt. The spices of this trashy co-production between Shaw Brothers and an Italian one-off company include humorous storytelling, off-the-wall happenings and some very tame T&A. Extra campy moments are being served by Lee Van Cleef's obnoxious wig, leather-clad bible-thumping psycho gunman Yancey Hobbitt (loveably hammed up by Julian Ugarte, the man who should've done way more obscure European genre productions than he did), wanna-be-witty dialogue, hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various little events (especially every jump made by Lo Lieh).<br /><br />While this little piece of action falls fare and square into the Turkey Territory, it's great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen, and you can't deny the charisma of this duo. Don't expect too much, and you'll get plenty out of it.<br /><br />This is my truth.

{"value":"This is one of the few episodes (if not the only one) with an indisputable error in its storytelling. While handling the Ralphie situation Christopher states that he has heard about Pie-O-My's death in the fire accident. This is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who must have killed Ralphie. There is however no way Chris could have heard about the accident. Who should have told him and when? By the time he is torn out of his delirium by Tony's call nobody else was informed.

{"value":"This film is pretty poor. The acting is abysmal and completely forced. Furthermore, by shooting the film as a docudrama doesn't necessarily make it more believable, you can't get out of it that easily Mr Dir. Don't let my comments mislead you however, as i would recommend you watch this film, as it does shed some light on the psychology or non existent psychology behind the perpetrators of such crimes. However, the climax of the film is absolutely rubbish! There is no other way to put it! It pure and simply fails to capture any sense of atmosphere! What takes place does not translate to me any feelings of desperation, panic, fear or dread that one would surely experience in such terrifying circumstances. No instead it leaves you with jaw dropping \"Was that it?!\" spilling from your tongue, and by no means are you haunted by these boys actions.

{"value":"I don't give much credence to AIDS conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies. This was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi-monde of San Francisco. The city, renowned for its beauty, has rarely appeared uglier than in this film. A sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene.<br /><br />While the acting and plot can't be said to be well-done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss. Actually, I found the most interesting performance to be Irit Levi as a crusty and cynical Jewish, lesbian (?) police detective. She's interesting, though not necessarily convincing.<br /><br />Highlights: the film's use of the garishly tragic Turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic

{"value":"A group of us watched this film are were really disgusted. We were willing to forgive the fact that our favorite character Jo wasn't on (it's not like the writers/producers could do anything about that). The writing was poor, the script was sub-par. What REALLY annoyed us: 1. When the two guys realized they were both dating Natalie, they didn't just leave they put up with that stupid (and ultimately degrading) contest - but only because they were macho competing guys, not because they really wanted Natalie. 2. Despite being unable to choose between the two guys before the reunion, Natalie suddenly decides that she really loves one of the guys and is now ready to marry him? (and there was no foreshadowing that he was really a better guy, it's as if the writers flipped a coin and then just had her spit it out at some convenient point in the film). 3. Blair makes a point of talking about how she does not want children and then all of a sudden when her husband says he wants to have children, she blissfully agrees with him.","finished_norm":["a","group","of","u","watch","thi","film","be","be","realli","disgust","we","be","will","to","forgiv","the","fact","that","our","favorit","charact","jo","be","not","on","it","not","like","the","writersproduc","can","do","anyth","about","that","the","write","be","poor","the","script","be","subpar","what","realli","annoi","u","when","the","two","gui","realiz","thei","be","both","date","natali","thei","do","not","just","leav","thei","put","up","with","that","stupid","and","ultim","degrad","contest","but","onli","becaus","thei","be","macho","compet","gui","not","becaus","thei","realli","want","natali","despit","be","unabl","to","choos","between","the","two","gui","befor","the","reunion","natali","suddenli","decid","that","she","realli","love","on","of","the","gui","and","be","now","readi","to","marri","him","and","there","be","no","foreshadow","that","he","be","realli","a","well","gui","it","a","if","the","writer","flip","a","coin","and","then","just","have","her","spit","it","out","at","some","conveni","point","in","the","film","blair","make","a","point","of","talk","about","how","she","doe","not","want","child","and","then","all","of","a","sudden","when","her","husband","sai","he","want","to","have","child","she","blissfulli","agre","with","him"],"filtered":["group","u","watch","thi","film","realli","disgust","forgiv","fact","favorit","charact","jo","like","writersproduc","anyth","write","poor","script","subpar","realli","annoi","u","two","gui","realiz","thei","date","natali","thei","leav","thei","put","stupid","ultim","degrad","contest","onli","becaus","thei","macho","compet","gui","becaus","thei","realli","want","natali","despit","unabl","choos","two","gui","befor","reunion","natali","suddenli","decid","realli","love","gui","readi","marri","foreshadow","realli","well","gui","writer","flip","coin","spit","conveni","point","film","blair","make","point","talk","doe","want","child","sudden","husband","sai","want","child","blissfulli","agre"],"filtered2":["group","u","watch","realli","disgust","forgiv","fact","favorit","charact","jo","like","writersproduc","anyth","write","poor","script","subpar","realli","annoi","u","two","gui","realiz","date","natali","leav","put","stupid","ultim","degrad","contest","onli","becaus","macho","compet","gui","becaus","realli","want","natali","despit","unabl","choos","two","gui","befor","reunion","natali","suddenli","decid","realli","love","gui","readi","marri","foreshadow","realli","well","gui","writer","flip","coin","spit","conveni","point","blair","make","point","talk","doe","want","child","sudden","husband","want","child","blissfulli","agre"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,10,11,13,18,20,22,37,47,54,55,65,66,74,77,79,97,104,112,136,146,159,180,186,249,271,287,391,405,410,536,584,622,647,733,735,785,822,963,1311,1334,1361,1502,1784,1855,1908,2193,2214,2629,2878,2975,3451,4299,5007,6439,6535,6888],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,10,11,13,18,20,22,37,47,54,55,65,66,74,77,79,97,104,112,136,146,159,180,186,249,271,287,391,405,410,536,584,622,647,733,735,785,822,963,1311,1334,1361,1502,1784,1855,1908,2193,2214,2629,2878,2975,3451,4299,5007,6439,6535,6888],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,5.658970784866987,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,2.5958480334723544,4.4629629644322915,3.412938870621443,1.8113893252729412,9.768498944627684,1.9073850067444174,3.859446346783224,1.9486336368009016,1.9463902258768238,1.9469506069506084,2.0545557924622586,2.0728240170322856,4.493325799357863,2.346825985579986,2.326138445979858,2.300267965194495,5.419462958538709,2.571852579609833,2.6754694156628323,2.757740698455715,2.841890188081905,3.109204957709252,3.109204957709252,3.2070272508030975,3.6254214301101193,3.5146700658174166,3.4933926673701317,3.6746621462132825,3.7636829971100436,3.7132521434831514,3.7952092507568174,3.813163054373413,4.035401218572811,4.456830177669989,4.383707912841026,4.396611317676934,4.520909034354511,4.77960356993304,5.0768550934009715,5.390512652256013,5.00274712124725,5.00274712124725,5.2288713006995975,5.426230734858092,5.521540914662417,5.770002273960917,5.967828017290836,19.02756440019674,6.543192162194399,6.794506590475304,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.5958924807382355E-4,1.5944782797301999E-4,1.5948719687345202E-4,1.594551348453435E-4,1.5947022538244344E-4,1.5944694882579914E-4,1.5949653904053572E-4,1.594232257203718E-4,1.5944786167068842E-4,1.596126337578947E-4,1.608791135498638E-4,1.5944812503732383E-4,1.5959913248782457E-4,1.5961575996390647E-4,1.5954325069182619E-4,1.594557629160409E-4,1.595106218654018E-4,1.5958568810634454E-4,1.5946399492955637E-4,1.59

{"value":"This film is basically two hours of Dafoe's character drinking himself - nearly literally - to death. The only surprise in this film is that you didn't have enough clues or character knowledge to be surprised. It was just a grim, sad waste of time.<br /><br />Willem Dafoe is excellent actor. Peter Stormare is an excellent actor. But this film just sucked. Slow doesn't make the movie bad, it was just bad. The sketchy plot mixed with artistic ramblings of anamorphic detail aren't cohesively drawn together in a meaningful way for a plot except to highlight some gore which is illustrated from several perspectives, finally at the end. I really appreciate the artistic vision, but as entertainment, it put me to sleep. (Seriously, I fell asleep and had to re-watch the film - which was even more disappointing.)<br /><br />I generally don't like to make negative comments or reviews on the works of others, even when they suck, but this film warranted one.

{"value":"\"I went to the movies, to see 'Beat Street' / it wasn't bad, it was kinda' neat / 'Krush Groove' was a flick, that I didn't mind / but when it came to 'Rappin', I drew the line.\" Word to your mother.<br /><br />Want me to stop?<br /><br />That's just a small sample of the stupa-fly style of rhymin' on display in this waste of film and location permits. This movie is seriously wack (thats 80s-speak for just f*cking awful). As an emcee, Mario Van Peebles is one hell of an actor. And as an actor, Mario Van Peebles is one hell of a bodybuilder.<br /><br />Any film calling itself \"Rappin'\" had better deliver at that genre's highest standard of the time. So why were 6 year olds rolling in the aisles, even back in the day when standards were so knee-high-to-\"Webster\"-low? Because this rap is weak. So weak that not even B.E.T. or Comedy Central will touch it with a 10-foot gold-rope chain.<br /><br />Blondie's \"Rapture\" is def poetry next to this bit of Dr. Suess in the hood.

{"value":"In the Fiji islands, the greedy and unscrupulous owner of the Valalola Resort Primal Park invites investors and guests for an opening party of his compound composed of hotel and zoo aiming to find partners for his discoveries. When a bunch of college smalltime thieves puts a virus in the security system to participate in a scavenger hunt, the greatest attractions of the zoo  sabretoothes from the prehistoric age developed from DNA found in fossils  escape, killing the hosts and guards for pleasure.<br /><br />The incredibly lame and cheap \"Attack of the Sabretooth\" is one of the worst movies I have recently seen. The characters are awful and not funny or pleasant and the story is a terrible Jurassik Park rip-off with a bad collection of clichés. Basically all the lines and situations are poor and stupid, but the winner is when the guard explains that the sabretoothes are bulimic and like to kill for pleasure.

{"value":"First of all, this film can be divided into three segments. A promising opening, with the ambushing of some cavalry by the Cheyenne. This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section, with the totally miscast Candice Bergen and \"Soldier Blue\" traveling together to reach the safety of an Army garrison. Miss Bergen spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth, and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s Jack Nicholson movie. I mean she maintains zero interest, with zero believability. The third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an Indian village. This is so obviously overdone to lay on the anti-war propaganda, that it comes across as simply long, outrageous, and contrived. Not recommended. - MERK................................ Jacobe (comment above) Here's an idea. Why don't you actually watch the movie you are commenting on, instead of chirping your liberal nonsense.

{"value":"This show is terrible, the jokes are all terrible and just getting worse and worse. I am one of those people who was never a big fan of Corner Gas but at least I liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two, all the jokes had been played out and the characters had nothing to them. Well at least Corner Gas was good at first, Little Mosque on the Prairie is typically awful bland CBC comedy that had nothing going for it from episode 1. Who are the people who are watching this show anyway, I am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? I don't know a single person who likes this show and can't stand it myself, the jokes are totally predictable and the characters are even less developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it won't last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being Muslim which is different and could/should have led to

{"value":"- A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something -<br /><br />I went to see this movie because it was about non-WWF wrestling and so I thought it might be funny. It wasn't. It is excruciating to watch. Embarrassing. Any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly squandered. <br /><br />I admit I don't like Jack Black anyway. After this I have been racking my brain to think of one good role that he has performed. The only thing I can come up with where he was o.k. was as a necessary foil to the John Cusack character in 'High Fidelity'. Jack Black is one of those awful relentless flat-out ham-it-up knockabout guys (like the little fat one in Abbot & Costello or Jerry Lewis) who should be told that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same thing as being funny. <br /><br />It is not even slapstick. It's just irritating.

{"value":"I read the book and really enjoyed it from beginning to end. However, when I saw the movie I was very disappointed. First of all, no disrespect to Deborah Raffin but she was too mature to play a woman of 24/25. The late Christopher Reeve was also miscast-same reason. Will, according to the book,was around 30. I would have love to see a little more exploration of his military life, his friend Red, Elly's trip to see him as that was an important part of the characters' storyline development. Also Miss Beasley was miscast as the book mentioned her being a Plus Size lady. I know the movie didn't have the budget of the \"Bridges Of Madison County\" which I believe was released around the same time. <br /><br />But to me this was a very poorly made, low budget, miscast movie. As someone mentioned, I wish that Miss Spenser would come out of retirement and write screenplays for her books as they ought to be. She knows her characters better than anyone, I hope that she would consider doing the casting too.

{"value":"this show is awful. no comedy, no plot no good characters. America are you blind give the award to real shows. i hate this show along with 30 rock. honestly I'm so glad they canceled this show. thank you CBS. keep two and a half men, keep Christine, keep rules of engagement keep how i meet your mother which really isn't funny but a lot funnier than this. this show is a rip off of friends. with the same director so thats okay. but keep this show gone and never bring it back. never ever ever ever. the only reason i didn't give it a 1 rating is because it keep my awake instead of asleep. those are the types of movies or TV shows that i give a one. the only reason i was still awake was because of the audiences laughter and i was looking forward to the next show. i really wish this show was funny sorry but my opinion stupid. very stupid. i don't

{"value":"The Christmas Secret was touted as a wonderful film, but I was truly disappointed. They even sold VHS and DVD copies of the film when it was over, which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project. As a screen actor myself I felt most of the performances were phoned in, although Beau Bridges, as Nick, did have a moment or two. If I were Richard Thomas I would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume. It was an embarrassment. I had been a fan since his Waltons days, but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work, so poor was this offering.<br /><br />In defence of the actors, the directing was stilted, mechanical, and thoroughly amateurish.<br /><br />I hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic. I turned the movie on because it had a good cast and I was prepared to enjoy the film.

{"value":"This movie was the worst i've ever seen.<br /><br />It doesn't seem to have a plot but the time you realize this is far beyond the beginning of the movie so you have to watch the shut for a long time to recognize the total incompetence of the director, aka the sloth that plays the tampon chick in the movie, and we do not believe the Willem Dafoe in this movie, he's a clone, because the real Dafoe, like we know from \"apocalypse now\" and \"the boon dock saints\", would never agreed to such a script.<br /><br />Duh, (Da)foe wrote this bill shut together with his twenty years minus baby. This movie starts with the credits of the two main characters, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the two script writers, Dafoe and Colagrande, and then the director, Colagrande.<br /><br />Bottomline (the story); Widow meets guy, guy bangs widow, widow smashes windscreen with guy who banged her.<br /><br />Title in Netherlands; The black widow (different title, same bullshit).<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!

{"value":"It's been nearly 30 years, and I STILL hate everyone involved in this movie. It remains the worst movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />Before seeing this, I never much minded Rivers, one way or the other. After seeing this movie, I have an allergic reaction when I accidentally see her on television.<br /><br />I got dragged to this - against my better judgment - by peer pressure. However, coming out of the theater, those friends swore an oath to never again overrule my choice of movie. Nearly thirty years later, we still carry around mental scars from this movie.<br /><br />On my deathbed, one of my regrets will be the time I wasted hoping that this movie might get better. It never did.<br /><br />If you are ever given a choice, you would prefer putting your own eyes out to sitting though this movie.<br /><br />I registered for IMDb comments just in the hope that perhaps I can warn others against viewing this movie.

{"value":"If you are wondering where many of the conspiracy theories and paranoid ideas about the the UN, Israel, and international affairs come from, look no further.<br /><br />This isn't a supernatural Hollywood film loosely based on some biblical passage. Instead, this movie was made by a company (Cloud Ten Pictures) with a political and religious agenda. As a movie, the end result at times more looks like clips out of a televangelism program (complete with family prayers and light breaking through church windows while harps are playing).<br /><br />For mainstream viewers, it may be hard to believe, but many people believe in this stuff literally, as presented in the movie. And that, perhaps, makes the movie important. You probably won't find a more concise exposition of the bizarre views of a significant number of your fellow citizens. So, if you view it, view it as a social/cultural document.

{"value":"As you all may know, JIGSAW did not make its way to Blackbuster because of a member of Full Moon's own staff, Devin Hamilton. Devin is the one who sells to all of the video chains. He recently released a movie, BLEED, which he was selling to Blackbuster at the same time as JIGSAW. He convinced the Blackbuster buyer not to take any JIGSAW, and double the number of BLEED. The result is that JIGSAW looks like a flop, and BLEED looks like a hit. The major problem with that is that BLEED is one of the worst movies ever, and as we all know, JIGSAW is, well, gold. I urge all of you to go on to the BLEED page on the internet and vote for the movie that wronged JIGSAW, and all of your talents. Likewise, you should go to the JIGSAW page and cast high votes for it (if you already haven't). We need to get JIGSAW up to at least an 8 or 8.5, and BLEED down to around a 2 (thus putting it on the internet's 100 worst movie listing).

{"value":"Two years before he wrote and directed \"Arthur\", Steve Gordon had a minor hit with his screenplay for this crackpot comedic vehicle for Henry Winkler, then TV's \"The Fonz\". A 1950s college thespian (and all-around jerk) woos a co-ed and gets married without any employment prospects on the horizon; to make ends meet, he turns to the flamboyant world of wrestling, eventually becoming a \"Gorgeous George\"-like celebrity. Turning likable Winkler into an obnoxious goof-off probably sounded like an interesting idea at the time (and a sure way to separate him from his television alter-ego), but the jokes and situations are often wrong-headed and mean, staged rather sloppily by director Carl Reiner. Particularly crude is a wincing bit involving Hervé Villechaize (of \"Fantasy Island\") putting the moves on Polly Holliday (Flo from \"Alice\"). As Henry's beloved, Kim Darby looks a little out of her element--particularly when surrounded by all these TV hams--rendering the romance aspect of the script inconsequential. *1/2 from
