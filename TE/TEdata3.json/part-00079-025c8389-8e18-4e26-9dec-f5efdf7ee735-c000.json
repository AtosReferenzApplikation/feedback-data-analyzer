{"value":"I commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a \"thumbs in the middle\" review, remarking that I'd give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode. I've seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in June 2006. And as a lifelong Batman fanatic, I can say without hesitation: this show is utter crap.<br /><br />Everything's wrong with it. Everything. Getting past just the lousy animation and design, the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories.<br /><br />And for God's sake...is it just me, or is the Joker in EVERY EPISODE?? Is Gotham that much of a revolving-door justice system? Or, again, is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains (see \"no character development\", above).<br /><br />And to make matters worse, every single Joker tale is the same 3-part formula.<br /><br />1) Joker gasses people.<br /><br />2) Joker sets out to gas the whole city.<br /><br />3) Batman saves the day.<br /><br />Pfeh.<br /><br />There was one episode I saw that wasn't a Joker story. The title escapes me, but the villain was that nefarious Cluemaster...the \"Think Thank Thunk\" episode with the quiz show. That was the single-worst Batman story I've ever seen, heard or read. Yes, worse than \"I've Got Batman in My Basement.\" <br /><br />I can't really say what I feel this show is because it's probably against the ToS, but it starts with \"B\" and rhymes with \"fastardization\". Thank goodness for the existence of the Timm/Dini/etc. era of Bat-entertainment, back from the Fox and Kids WB days. Stuff that good, and I should have known this, just couldn't possibly have lasted forever, unfortunately.","finished_norm":["i","comment","on","thi","when","it","debut","and","give","it","a","thumb","in","the","middl","review","remark","that","i","have","give","it","the","benefit","of","the","doubt","beyond","just","the","episod","i","have","see","a","total","of","six","episod","now","up","to","thi","point","in","june","and","a","a","lifelong","batman","fanat","i","can","sai","without","hesit","thi","show","be","utter","crapbr","br","everyth","wrong","with","it","everyth","get","past","just","the","lousi","anim","and","design","the","stori","be","ridicul","convolut","and","with","no","charact","develop","or","appar","interest","by","the","writer","of","thi","dreck","to","give","ani","substanc","to","ani","storiesbr","br","and","for","god","sakei","it","just","me","or","be","the","joker","in","everi","episod","be","gotham","that","much","of","a","revolvingdoor","justic","system","or","again","be","it","just","a","complet","lack","of","interest","in","the","writer","to","put","ani","effort","into","other","villain","see","no","charact","develop","abovebr","br","and","to","make","matter","wrong","everi","singl","joker","tale","be","the","same","part","formulabr","br","joker","ga","peoplebr","br","joker","set","out","to","ga","the","whole","citybr","br","batman","save","the","daybr","br","pfehbr","br","there","be","on","episod","i","see","that","be","not","a","joker","stori","the","titl","escap","me","but","the","villain","be","that","nefari","cluemasterth","think","thank","thunk","episod","with","the","quiz","show","that","be","the","singleworst","batman","stori","i","have","ever","see","hear","or","read","ye","wrong","than","i","have","get","batman","in","my","basem","br","br","i","ca","not","realli","sai","what","i","feel","thi","show","be","becaus","it","probabl","against","the","to","but","it","start","with","b","and","rhym","with","fastard","thank","good","for","the","exist","of","the","timmdinietc","era","of","batentertain","back","from","the","fox","and","kid","wb","dai","stuff","that","good","and","i","should","have","know","thi","just","can","not","possibli","have","last","forev","unfortun"],"filtered":["comment","thi","debut","give","thumb","middl","review","remark","give","benefit","doubt","beyond","episod","see","total","six","episod","thi","point","june","lifelong","batman","fanat","sai","without","hesit","thi","show","utter","crapbr","br","everyth","wrong","everyth","get","past","lousi","anim","design","stori","ridicul","convolut","charact","develop","appar","interest","writer","thi","dreck","give","ani","substanc","ani","storiesbr","br","god","sakei","joker","everi","episod","gotham","much","revolvingdoor","justic","system","complet","lack","interest","writer","put","ani","effort","villain","see","charact","develop","abovebr","br","make","matter","wrong","everi","singl","joker","tale","part","formulabr","br","joker","ga","peoplebr","br","joker","set","ga","whole","citybr","br","batman","save","daybr","br","pfehbr","br","episod","see","joker","stori","titl","escap","villain","nefari","cluemasterth","think","thank","thunk","episod","quiz","show","singleworst","batman","stori","ever","see","hear","read","ye","wrong","get","batman","basem","br","br","ca","realli","sai","feel","thi","show","becaus","probabl","start","b","rhym","fastard","thank","good","exist","timmdinietc","era","batentertain","back","fox","kid","wb","dai","stuff","good","know","thi","possibli","last","forev","unfortun"],"filtered2":["comment","debut","give","thumb","middl","review","remark","give","benefit","doubt","beyond","see","total","six","point","june","lifelong","batman","fanat","without","hesit","show","utter","crapbr","everyth","wrong","everyth","get","past","lousi","anim","design","stori","ridicul","convolut","charact","develop","appar","interest","writer","dreck","give","ani","substanc","ani","storiesbr","god","sakei","joker","everi","gotham","revolvingdoor","justic","system","complet","lack","interest","writer","put","ani","effort","villain","see","charact","develop","abovebr","make","matter","wrong","everi","singl","joker","tale","part","formulabr","joker","ga","peoplebr","joker","set","ga","whole","citybr","batman","save","daybr","pfehbr","see","joker","stori","titl","escap","villain","nefari","cluemasterth","think","thank","thunk","quiz","show","singleworst","batman","stori","ever","see","hear","read","ye","wrong","get","batman","basem","ca","realli","feel","show","becaus","probabl","start","b","rhym","fastard","thank","good","exist","timmdinietc","era","batentertain","back","fox","kid","wb","dai","stuff","good","know","possibli","last","forev","unfortun"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,10,12,13,17,22,25,26,27,28,30,43,44,60,61,63,66,71,81,85,103,109,111,114,125,132,144,145,148,159,176,183,184,189,193,209,216,227,264,274,277,280,287,308,320,352,361,401,440,443,502,520,528,554,558,567,638,642,651,681,820,1024,1086,1116,1204,1228,1324,1348,1354,1424,1434,1611,1686,1864,2240,2318,2349,2442

{"value":"Roger Corman is undeniably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directors/producers in history. He was single-handedly responsible for some of my favorite horror films ever (like the Edgar Allen Poe adaptations \"Masque of the Red Death\" and \"Pit and the Pendulum\") as well as some insufferably cheap and tacky rubbish quickies (like \"Creature from the Haunted Sea\" and \"She Gods of the Shark Reef\"). Corman also made a couple of movies that are simply unclassifiable and  simply put  nearly impossible to judge properly. \"The Trip\", for example, as well as this imaginatively titled \"Gas-s-s-s\" can somewhat be labeled as psychedelic exploitation. In other words, they're incredibly strange hippie-culture influenced movies. Half of the time you haven't got the slightest idea what's going on, who these characters are that walk back and forth through the screen and where the hell this whole thing is going. The plot is simply and yet highly effective: a strange but deadly nerve gas is accidentally unleashed and promptly annihilates that the entire world population over the age of 25. This *could* be the basic premise of an atmospheric, gritty and nail-bitingly suspenseful post-apocalyptic Sci-Fi landmark, but writer George Armitage and Roger Corman decided to turn it into a \"trippy\" road-movie comedy. None of the characters is even trying to prevent their inevitable upcoming deaths; they just party out in the streets and found little juvenile crime syndicates. \"Gas-s-s-s\" is a disappointingly boring and tries overly hard to be bizarre. The entire script appears to be improvised at the spot and not at all funny. Definitely not my cup of tea, but the film does have a loyal fan base and many admirers, so who am I to say that it's not worth your time or

{"value":"This movie appears to have been an on the job training exercise for the Coppola family. It doesn't seem to know whether to be an \"A\" or a \"B\" western. I mean, the hero is called Hopalong Cassidy for God's sake. William Boyd must be spinning in his grave.<br /><br />All the \"B\" western cliches are here. The two-gun pearly toothed hero in the white hat with the trusty steed (\"C'mon Thunder\"), the all-in-black bearded villain, the heroine in distress, the rancher in trouble, the cowardly sheriff, over the top bad guys etc.<br /><br />The acting, with few exceptions, is strictly from the Yakima Canutt School of Acting. Chris Lybbert (who?) as the hero and Louis Schweibert (who?) as the villain look like they would have been more at home in a 30's Poverty Row quickie. The addition to the cast of veteran performers Martin Sheen, Robert Carradine, Clu Gulager and Will Hutchins helps a little, but they are not given enough to do to salvage this one.<br /><br />What was the point of the Martin Sheen/Robert Carradine framing sequences? Are we to believe that the Sheen character was a ghost? What was the purpose of the black gloves? It just didn't make sense.<br /><br />Being a great lover of westerns from all genres, I tried hard to find some redeeming qualities in this film. The cinematography was quite good and the settings looked very authentic. Aside from the hero and main villain, the other characters looked authentic.<br /><br />If the producers were going to resurrect the Hopalong Cassidy character, they might have given some thought to

{"value":"The central theme in this movie seems to be confusion, as the relationships, setting, acting and social context all lead to the same place: confusion. Even Harvey Keitel appears to be out of his element, and lacks his usual impeccable clarity, direction and intensity. To make matters worse, his character's name is 'Che', and we are only told (directly, by the narrator) well into the film that he is not 'that' Che, just a guy named Che. The family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and once defined, the family is divided - the younger generation off to America. So cliché. Other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy's family; however the political stance of the director is murky at best, and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed. So they lost their property (acquired by gambling profits) - so what? Refusing to take a political stand, when making a movie about the Cuban revolution, is an odd and cowardly choice. Not to mention the movie was in English! Why are all these Cubans speaking English? No wonder they did not get permission to film in Cuba. And if family life is most important to look at here, it would be great if we could figure out who is who - we are 'introduced' to them all in the beginning - a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film! The acting was mostly shallow, wooden, and unbelievable, timing was off all around. The 'special' visual effects were confusing and distracting. References to American films - and the black character as Greek chorus - strictly gratuitous, intellectually ostentatious, and consistently out of place.

{"value":"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Are all teen slasher flicks suffering from a drought of originality? It awfully seems so. First of all, this is a noble premise that could've been utilized well. A rejected young nerd who grows up, stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high? Can't say you had nothing to work with. But this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers. Everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike. We know the pattern by now. These stupid slasher movies push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute. Let me ask you something: Who, in their right mind, is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark, dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she's all alone and surrounded by corpses? Does that make any damn sense at all?<br /><br />\"Valentine\" is only occasionally innovative. One good shot involves the butchering of Denise Richards' character. She gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw. There's some good songs in the soundtrack, including one cool track by Orgy. The music video is contained in the special features section on the DVD.<br /><br />Even the acting is mediocre at best. The actors all sleep through their roles. Of course, David Boreanaz is often stoic, even in his portrayal as the title character on \"Angel.\" Denise Richards is a fine actress, though, and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movie.<br /><br />\"Valentine\" is just like you'd expect: pretentious, implausible, forgettable, cheesy and without a good scare in sight. Don't even bother.<br /><br />My score: 4 (out of

{"value":"A killer, cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder. At his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave. This of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look. The two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem, are back on the case. Two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing. Thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. Sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish.<br /><br />The acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays Dr Vincent van Gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film. The other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out. Now I'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible. If it wasn't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness I would probably have fallen asleep. There is a bit of gore but it's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims. The zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times. There is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. The doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing I have ever seen in a film. It is just a plastic toy on a fishing line.<br /><br />The ending is extremely bad. You would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does.

{"value":"That's right. A movie written, directed and produced by Fred Tepper and family. (Fred should have known better, having worked the sets of 'Titantic' and 'Dogma'.) <br /><br />So, the plot. There are some scientists, and some forest rangers, and a hot chick with huge fake breasts. They are all really bad at their jobs, including the hot chick(who I think is supposed to be a photographer, but who cares because she wears a bikini). One of the forest rangers comments that the scientists are \"professional people,\" which is good, because it would be horrible if they were professional grubs or jellybeans or Ewoks.<br /><br />They are hiking through the woods in search of some strange ape-like bones, and no one even once mentions that the bones just might be those of the infamous Bigfoot. They just wander around and one of the rangers unabashedly hits on the hottie. We all hope he dies real soon (along with his sister who's meant to be the cute naive one, but is really just annoying). Then they, *gasp*, find a Sasqu... I mean, Ape-like Animal Burial Ground. Of course, no mentions that it might just be Bigfoot bones they're messing with... I guess scientists and forest rangers just don't think about those types of things.<br /><br />Then Sasquatch and his tribe get really angry and kill all the people we dislike, chases the other losers away and buries his Great Aunt Muriel and Cousin Josh (who died in an unfortunate trout accident) all over again.<br /><br />Insipid, boring dialogue (I zoned out several times), inane plot, unlikable characters, bad CGI (a man in a monkey suit would look better), and acting that just wasn't very good all add up to make a movie I won't be watching again.<br /><br />You check it out though; it's

{"value":"Think of a no-budget version of China Syndrome being directed by a film student who idolizes John Woo and you'll get 'Power Play.' The idea was good, but the execution, acting, and dialog absolutely killed it, not to mention ridiculous amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to compensate for lack of substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie.<br /><br />This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake. The rather cavalier reporter, going up against what should've been a more ruthless bunch of company execs, is chased around town (along with anyone he speaks to) in order to \"clean\" whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plant's faults.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no real sense of emergency because the characters interact with much hesitancy, coupled with idiotic dialog and a lot of horrible acting. Not to mention, the viewer, who may only be attracted to the movie for it's action genre appeal, is forced to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em-ups plus earthquake disaster scenes. All of the focus was put in the wrong place to apologetically compensate for the lack of direction and more interesting sequence of events that should've propelled the story. It might've been much better had the filmmakers focused more on a thriller, and paid greater attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story.

{"value":"A particularly maligned example of Italian cult cinema with a nonsensical title to boot (if anything, the alternate THE MARK OF Satan is even less relevant to the plot!), this hybrid of Gothic Horror and Giallo (with a strong dose of Erotica) only contrives a flat sort of atmosphere throughout  actually matched by handling which is downright dreadful! Here, we get the usual group of people (an acting troupe) stranded on an island (to which they were invited by a Count  since he had become enamored of the leading lady, a dead-ringer for his missing spouse)! The characters are pretty much stereotypes: middle-aged but dashing hero (played by Giacomo Rossi-Stuart and whose family history bears more than its share of violent tragedy), demure heroine, sluttish companion (recalling Mae West and emerging the most annoying of the lot!), a meek but devoted stage manager (forever chided by one and all for his unmanly behavior!), a couple of lesbians, a mysterious gardener (the ubiquitous Luciano Pigozzi who, for once, gets in on the action, if you know what I mean), an envious housekeeper (nominal star Femi Benussi though, for what it is worth, this is really an ensemble piece), a religious fanatic of a butler, an impressionable chambermaid, etc. While the film is not by any means unwatchable, the atrocious dubbing, snail's pace, shoddy production (with the scenes depicting the raging sea lifted from some black-and-white film!) and the fact that the murders only occur within the concluding half-hour do not help matters. Besides, Marcello Giombini's score, though pleasant in itself, comes off as incongruously modern under the circumstances; that said, the revelation proves a surprisingly elaborate one (considering there is surely no shortage of suspects

{"value":"A young basketball-playing professor of genetics is doing research on the genetic sequence, using human fetuses. He hopes to be able to find a cure for all diseases and aging. He's pressured into concluding his research because he hasn't published, so the university is having trouble justifying funding him (I think).<br /><br />He does a trial injection on a monkey, which quickly dies. He then tries it on himself. He starts a relationship with the single mother of an extremely annoying little boy; she's the one who had been demanding results from the research.<br /><br />Initially, he seems to have no effects from the injection, except some new strength. He then realizes that he had some memory loss, and starts recalling what happened. Additionally, he starts to appear very unhealthy.<br /><br />Since the movie is named metamorphosis, he does eventually change into something else. You won't believe your eyes - either what he turned into, or the absolutely crappy costume the actor is wearing to depict what he's turned into. Incredibly, there's a further change in store - the end of the movie is really, really absurd.<br /><br />About the only thing this movie has going for it is that Laura Gemser is in it, but she has a very small part.<br /><br />I'd once seen a the video box for this with a sculpted plastic form glued to the boxcover. Possibly it might even have had some electronics in it at one time, perhaps eyes that light up (the main character's eyes occasionally turn green in the movie). The copy I watched had a box that only showed tear marks where the glue had held on the plastic, which had been removed. The novelty boxcover, if it still had it, would have been the only reason I would have held onto this movie; I'm definitely getting rid of it.","finished_norm":["a","young","basketballplai","professor","of","genet","be","do","research","on","the","genet","sequenc","us","human","fetu","he","hope","to","be","abl","to","find","a","cure","for","all","diseas","and","ag","he","pressur","into","conclud","hi","research","becaus","he","have","not","publish","so","the","univers","be","have","troubl","justifi","fund","him","i","thinkbr","br","he","doe","a","trial","inject","on","a","monkei","which","quickli","die","he","then","try","it","on","himself","he","start","a","relationship","with","the","singl","mother","of","a","extrem","annoi","littl","boi","she","the","on","who","have","be","demand","result","from","the","researchbr","br","initi","he","seem","to","have","no","effect","from","the","inject","except","some","new","strength","he","then","realiz","that","he","have","some","memori","loss","and","start","recal","what","happen","addition","he","start","to","appear","veri","unhealthybr","br","sinc","the","movi","be","name","metamorphosi","he","doe","eventu","chang","into","someth","els","you","wo","not","believ","your","ey","either","what","he","turn","into","or","the","absolut","crappi","costum","the","actor","be","wear","to","depict","what","he","turn","into","incredibli","there","a","far","chang","in","store","the","end","of","the","movi","be","realli","realli","absurdbr","br","about","the","onli","thing","thi","movi","have","go","for","it","be","that","laura","gemser","be","in","it","but","she","have","a","veri","small","partbr","br","i","have","onc","see","a","the","video","box","for","thi","with","a","sculpt","plastic","form","glue","to","the","boxcov","possibli","it","mai","even","have","have","some","electron","in","it","at","on","time","perhap","ey","that","light","up","the","main","charact","ey","occasion","turn","green","in","the","movi","the","copi","i","watch","have","a","box","that","onli","show","tear","mark","where","the","glue","have","hold","on","the","plastic","which","have","be","remov","the","novelti","boxcov","if","it","still","have","it","would","have","be","the","onli","reason","i","would","have","hold","onto","thi","movi","i","be","definit","get","rid","of","it"],"filtered":["young","basketballplai","professor","genet","research","genet","sequenc","us","human","fetu","hope","abl","find","cure","diseas","ag","pressur","conclud","hi","research","becaus","publish","univers","troubl","justifi","fund","thinkbr","br","doe","trial","inject","monkei","quickli","die","try","start","relationship","singl","mother","extrem","annoi","littl","boi","demand","result","researchbr","br","initi","seem","effect","inject","except","new","strength","realiz","memori","loss","start","recal","happen","addition","start","appear","veri","unhealthybr","br","sinc","movi","name","metamorphosi","doe","eventu","chang","someth","els","wo","believ","ey","either","turn","absolut","crappi","costum","actor","wear","depict","turn","incredibli","far","chang","store","end","movi","realli","realli","absurdbr","br","onli","thing","thi","movi","go","laura","gemser","veri","small","partbr","br","onc","see","video","box","thi","sculpt","plastic","form","glue","boxcov","possibli","mai","even","electron","time","perhap","ey","light","main","charact","ey","occasion","turn","green","movi","copi","watch","box","onli","show","tear","mark","glue","hold","plastic","remov","novelti","boxcov","still","onli","reason","hold","onto","thi","movi","definit","get","rid"],"filtered2":["young","basketballplai","professor","genet","research","genet","sequenc","us","human","fetu","hope","abl","find","cure","diseas","ag","pressur","conclud","research","becaus","publish","univers","troubl","justifi","fund","thinkbr","doe","trial","inject","monkei","quickli","die","try","start","relationship","singl","mother","extrem","annoi","littl","boi","demand","result","researchbr","initi","seem","effect","inject","except","new","strength","realiz","memori","loss","start","recal","happen","addition","start","appear","veri","unhealthybr","sinc","name","metamorphosi","doe","eventu","chang","someth","els","wo","believ","ey","either","turn","absolut","crappi","costum","actor","wear","depict","turn","incredibli","far","chang","store","end","realli","realli","absurdbr","onli","thing","go","laura","gemser","veri","small","partbr","onc","see","video","box","sculpt","plastic","form","glue","boxcov","possibli","mai","even","electron","time","perhap","ey","light","main","charact","ey","occasion","turn","green","copi","watch","box","onli","show","tear","mark","glue","hold","plastic","remov","novelti","boxcov","still","onli","reason","hold","onto","definit","get","rid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,13,14,15,18,22,24,28,29,35,36,38,41,46,53,56,64,71,87,91,94,95,96,101,106,135,143,162,170,179,181,196,207,222,232,236,240,271,278,281,282,292,293,318,329,349,353,363,392,397,405,406,414,442,443,447,454,514,558,577,654,687,689,716,717,747,752,770,776,793,913,1011,1068,1077,1099,1120,1172,1179

{"value":"Moron and girlfriend conduct some ritual to resurrect the dead, in attempt to prove that the dead can not be brought back to life. Not surprisingly, they do resurrect a dead soul who commences chopping them up with an axe, and the next day some college aged people are telling the story around a campfire. The guy with the axe turns up and starts hacking up the idiots telling the story. The group calls the cops, the cop sees blood splattered all over and thinks it's a mountain lion(!?) and soon after is axed by some deformed killer who may or may not be a ghost.<br /><br />Moronic little splatter movie which was filmed in broad daylight but where several characters are carrying flashlights and talking as though it were the middle of the night, and wanting to send up a signal flare to attract attention. One guy has a gun in one hand and bullets in the other but doesn't bother to load it, then after he finally loads it, he has several opportunities to shoot the killer but doesn't bother to, because that would end the movie too early. Then he throws the gun away! Also detrimental is characters who show no emotion and don't look the least bit concerned after their friends are chopped up into pieces and lousy effects (the human heart looks like a piece of chicken meat, the car blown up at the end clearly was a model car) and awful dialogue and some really ugly female nudity doesn't help. And in the end it tries to get away with it's incoherence by saying that it was all the invention of the same college aged people telling campfire stories at the start of this movie. <br /><br />Then the killer turns up for real in the last scene hacks them into pieces. Again.<br /><br />Mediocre of it's kind, good only for some unintended laughs.<br /><br />*1/2 out of

{"value":"This movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school, watching as the RAWANDAN genocide un-furls around him.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of Rawanda. Then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic \"NEW-COMER\" a young teacher who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously. As he and the driver approach a road-block he plays around with his drivers I.D. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they'll be killed. And thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him. Suddenly realizes that every Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that the Europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help. The media cameras cannot stop machete's, and there's too many machete wielding militia-men too shoot. the title comes from the armies captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead-bodies around his compound, but won't shoot the Militia-men that are killing people around the compound. Mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet. Finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims, flees with his tail in-between his legs, rather than face immanent death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind.<br /><br />It's more of character study, and a come to Jesus moment for one character, than a story about the genocide in \"RAWANDA\". This movie didn't have to take place in RAWANDA, it could have taken place any one of the Genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","tell","through","the","ey","of","a","young","teacher","at","a","cathol","school","watch","a","the","rawandan","genocid","unfurl","around","himbr","br","the","movi","start","off","with","a","brief","explan","about","the","past","histori","and","rivalri","of","rawanda","then","it","jump","to","the","stori","a","tell","through","the","ey","of","a","young","idealist","newcom","a","young","teacher","who","doe","not","take","life","or","the","situat","too","serious","a","he","and","the","driver","approach","a","roadblock","he","plai","around","with","hi","driver","id","not","realiz","that","thi","be","a","seriou","moment","and","that","if","the","driver","ca","not","identifi","himself","a","be","of","the","right","tribe","to","the","soldier","thei","will","be","kill","and","that","how","he","treat","the","unfold","stori","of","chao","and","unfold","around","him","suddenli","realiz","that","everi","rawandan","includ","hi","driver","be","involv","and","that","the","european","soldier","and","tourist","cannot","and","will","not","help","the","medium","camera","cannot","stop","machet","and","there","too","mani","machet","wield","militiaman","too","shoot","the","titl","come","from","the","armi","captain","sai","he","go","to","shoot","the","dog","eat","the","deadbodi","around","hi","compound","but","wo","not","shoot","the","militiaman","that","be","kill","peopl","around","the","compound","mainli","becaus","thei","have","not","fire","at","the","soldier","yet","final","he","realiz","the","hopeless","of","the","situat","and","the","gui","who","tell","the","evacu","team","that","he","want","to","give","up","hi","seat","for","on","of","the","intend","victim","flee","with","hi","tail","inbetween","hi","leg","rather","than","face","imman","death","with","the","school","kid","he","promis","not","to","leav","behindbr","br","it","much","of","charact","studi","and","a","come","to","jesu","moment","for","on","charact","than","a","stori","about","the","genocid","in","rawanda","thi","movi","do","not","have","to","take","place","in","rawanda","it","can","have","take","place","ani","on","of","the","genocid","hell","hole","go","around","thi","world","at","ani","give","time"],"filtered":["thi","movi","tell","ey","young","teacher","cathol","school","watch","rawandan","genocid","unfurl","around","himbr","br","movi","start","brief","explan","past","histori","rivalri","rawanda","jump","stori","tell","ey","young","idealist","newcom","young","teacher","doe","take","life","situat","serious","driver","approach","roadblock","plai","around","hi","driver","id","realiz","thi","seriou","moment","driver","ca","identifi","right","tribe","soldier","thei","kill","treat","unfold","stori","chao","unfold","around","suddenli","realiz","everi","rawandan","includ","hi","driver","involv","european","soldier","tourist","help","medium","camera","stop","machet","mani","machet","wield","militiaman","shoot","titl","come","armi","captain","sai","go","shoot","dog","eat","deadbodi","around","hi","compound","wo","shoot","militiaman","kill","peopl","around","compound","mainli","becaus","thei","fire","soldier","yet","final","realiz","hopeless","situat","gui","tell","evacu","team","want","give","hi","seat","intend","victim","flee","hi","tail","inbetween","hi","leg","rather","face","imman","death","school","kid","promis","leav","behindbr","br","much","charact","studi","come","jesu","moment","charact","stori","genocid","rawanda","thi","movi","take","place","rawanda","take","place","ani","genocid","hell","hole","go","around","thi","world","ani","give","time"],"filtered2":["tell","ey","young","teacher","cathol","school","watch","rawandan","genocid","unfurl","around","himbr","start","brief","explan","past","histori","rivalri","rawanda","jump","stori","tell","ey","young","idealist","newcom","young","teacher","doe","take","life","situat","serious","driver","approach","roadblock","plai","around","driver","id","realiz","seriou","moment","driver","ca","identifi","right","tribe","soldier","kill","treat","unfold","stori","chao","unfold","around","suddenli","realiz","everi","rawandan","includ","driver","involv","european","soldier","tourist","help","medium","camera","stop","machet","mani","machet","wield","militiaman","shoot","titl","come","armi","captain","go","shoot","dog","eat","deadbodi","around","compound","wo","shoot","militiaman","kill","peopl","around","compound","mainli","becaus","fire","soldier","yet","final","realiz","hopeless","situat","gui","tell","evacu","team","want","give","seat","intend","victim","flee","tail","inbetween","leg","rather","face","imman","death","school","kid","promis","leav","behindbr","charact","studi","come","jesu","moment","charact","stori","genocid","rawanda","take","place","rawanda","take","place","ani","genocid","hell","hole","go","around","world","ani","give","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,7,8,10,17,18,22,23,27,30,31,34,37,40,50,55,71,74,75,76,81,85,90,98,114,117,121,135,156,160,16

{"value":"Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) suddenly becomes a widower when his wife dies. Soon after, he's approached by a Dr. Price, an expert in Electronic Voice Phenomena (EVP), who claims he's been receiving messages from Jonathan's departed wife Anna via sundry electronic gadgets. Is Anna trying to tell Jonathan something? Is this merely a hint of something on a larger cosmic or otherworldly scale? It's good to see Keaton in a leading role, but the story he's stuck with is convoluted and absurd at points; it's as if the movie doesn't know how to answer any of the questions it brings up, so it just distracts the viewer with new, unrelated questions.<br /><br />Keaton himself is pretty good, convincingly cast as the bereaving widower desperately trying to communicate with his late wife. He's matured quite a bit as an actor, leaving behind the frat-friendly waacky-hijinks roles he played 15 or so years earlier. He looks a little craggy, with a perhaps few more wrinkles than one might expect, but he's lost none of the guile and panache that he's shown during his quarter century in Hollywood.<br /><br />So it's not that Keaton turns in a mediocre performance, it's that the script itself is subpar. Written by Niall Johnson, the plot gets more confusing as it progresses, each tortuous path ending in another tortuous path. This is all well and good if the path leads to some sort of acceptable denouement, something that ties more or less everything together and explains... something. But not White Noise; I knew less about what had happened to Jonathan than I did before I'd first seen him.<br /><br />Keaton's really the only reason to watch this junk, although he gets fine support

{"value":"Sam Mraovich should never be allowed to touch a camera again. If he does he should be arrested on the spot...at the very least for petty larceny. Anybody who pays even a dime to rent any of his garbage should file a claim and be compensated. This was innocently my first viewing of his \"work\"...and it will my last. Ed Wood looks awfully good to me right now.<br /><br />When I return this piece of crap to the video store, I will personally ask that it be taken off the shelf. An active supporter of gay cinema, I am incensed and angered that this warped, exceedingly untalented man-child be allowed to distribute and package something like this, with a coltish pretty boy on the cover (Jamie Brett Gabel, who, thankfully, has no other acting credits in IMDb) and an interesting synopsis on the back used as bait, and then market it as a \"movie\" rental. Trust me, this has no place being on any rack anywhere; it is simply not a movie in any sense of the word. Offensive, irresponsible junk such as this can only be detrimental to the efforts being made to promote and support gay cinema (hell, gay rights in general!) For those tempting to rent this out because of the cover, you WILL be disappointed. Gabel is not as flattering to look at on film as he is on the cover, and he appears once or twice without a shirt -- that's it. Instead, the homely Mroavich inflicts on us his own disgusting, sorry-looking dough-boy nakedness.<br /><br />This \"thing\" he \"assembled\" is a reverse vanity project for Mraovich. Both he and his friend Michael Habousch (who, I understand, puts out similar sleazy garbage) are terrible in this.

{"value":"Now I recently had the viewing pleasure to watch the hilarious comedy Bachelor Party, one of my new favorite comedies, laughed until it just hurt type of movies. So I naturally wanted to see the sequel, hoping it would have the same laughs, but instead Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation is made by the American Pie generation where it's tasteless and defeats the hole purpose of the first film. Yeah, the first film has nudity, but it doesn't show in every single scene. Also the plot is exactly the same from the first, it's not always a complaint with me, but this could have been a little more original. The only thing is that I'm glad that at least no old actors from the original appear in this movie, because it would have been cheesy or really silly looking.<br /><br />Ron and Melinda are engaged, after only 2 months of dating, everyone is against it. Melinda has a rich family, but they're pretty happy with Ron, and Melinda's brother, Todd is scared that Ron will take his job. So they go out on a weekend to Miami for a bachelor party and Todd is going to make sure that he'll trap Ron into a picture that will make Melinda change her mind about the marriage.<br /><br />Bachelor Party 2: The Last Temptation has a couple laughs here and there, but over all fails to deliver what the first film accomplished. These guys, Ron's friends, were more obnoxious than likable, except for Seth, he was kinda funny. The only likable characters other than Seth is Ron and Melinda, everyone else just more or less gets on your nerves. You wanna watch this film? Just watch Girls Gone Wild, it's the same thing only it doesn't try to pretend that it's a film.

{"value":"\"The Cat's Meow\" contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue, and some fine performances, a few of which surprised me. Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin (partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer); Joanna Lumley is compelling as novelist Elinor Glyn; and Kirsten Dunst is winning as Marion Davies (though why movies never use her real-life stutter is difficult to explain). But these elements don't add up to a successful whole. The screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes--the meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well crafted--but not so hard on the big picture. Several minor characters don't need to be there, and don't behave consistently. The basic plot is full of illogic (e.g., why does Thomas Ince think it's a good idea to tell Hearst something he really doesn't want to hear?), and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome. I'd like to think a trip on Hearst's yacht was more fun than the movie indicates. Davies is characterized as a standard bubbly Flapper type, which isn't really accurate, and the screenwriter's ideas about Chaplin and love are implausible. <br /><br />Strangely, Bogdanovich, who seemed so connected to the Thirties in \"Paper Moon\", lacks a similar affinity for the Twenties. He insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream, which gives the party guests a very artificial look, and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period (e.g., \"Yes, We Have No Bananas\"). When Hearst insists everybody \"Charleston, Charleston!\" it looks as if the actors had a ten-minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot. <br /><br />The lives of silent film stars can make

{"value":"The main aspect about the Superstar's movies at his later stages were the frequency, the lacuna between one movie and the next. Being a well established star of the south Indian cinema, the feedbacks he was receiving before Baba was great. <br /><br />Since Nattukku Oru Nallavan (1991), the number of movies he acted in Tamil as a mass Hero in 11 years were only 11 exactly at the rate of 1 per year. All of these were a great hit. He was having a image that many thought could not be easily brought down. <br /><br />But after Padayappa (1999), he went into a state of Hibernation. His fans all over the world, especially in South India were ready to see movie of any kind with their superstar in action. So, the Tamil cinema industry decided to come with Baba. <br /><br />The movie makers thought that the fans will take whatever they show with Superstar in it. But this clearly did not work out in this movie. As usual, the hype from the media and the expectation from the fans were way beyond limit. <br /><br />Rajinikanth's image was totally damaged. The fans went nuts. The movie's collection did not meet the expected level. Reputation of great people went down. <br /><br />The only positive aspect about this movie was the songs by A.R.Rehman. Rehman is known to have composed good music for some worst movies like Tajmahal, Kadal Virus, Alli Arjuna, Paarthale Paravasam, Star, En Swasa Katre, Vandicholai Chinnarasu etc. Well, i never thought that this movie would join that league.<br /><br />You'l feel very much depressed not because the movie was bad, it'l be because of the superstar's image going down. It took him five full years to regain it fully back with two movies Chandramukhi and Sivaji and give fans back what they really look for in a superstar film.","finished_norm":["the","main","aspect","about","the","superstar","movi","at","hi","late","stage","be","the","frequenc","the","lacuna","between","on","movi","and","the","next","be","a","good","establish","star","of","the","south","indian","cinema","the","feedback","he","be","receiv","befor","baba","be","great","br","br","sinc","nattukku","oru","nallavan","the","numb","of","movi","he","act","in","tamil","a","a","mass","hero","in","year","be","onli","exactli","at","the","rate","of","per","year","all","of","thi","be","a","great","hit","he","be","have","a","imag","that","mani","think","can","not","be","easili","bring","down","br","br","but","after","padayappa","he","go","into","a","state","of","hibern","hi","fan","all","over","the","world","especi","in","south","india","be","readi","to","see","movi","of","ani","kind","with","their","superstar","in","action","so","the","tamil","cinema","industri","decid","to","come","with","baba","br","br","the","movi","maker","think","that","the","fan","will","take","whatev","thei","show","with","superstar","in","it","but","thi","clearli","do","not","work","out","in","thi","movi","a","usual","the","hyp","from","the","medium","and","the","expect","from","the","fan","be","wai","beyond","limit","br","br","rajinikanth","imag","be","total","damag","the","fan","go","nut","the","movi","collect","do","not","meet","the","expect","level","reput","of","great","peopl","go","down","br","br","the","onli","posit","aspect","about","thi","movi","be","the","song","by","arrehman","rehman","be","know","to","have","compos","good","music","for","some","wrong","movi","like","tajmah","kadal","viru","alli","arjuna","paarthal","paravasam","star","en","swasa","katr","vandicholai","chinnarasu","etc","good","i","never","think","that","thi","movi","would","join","that","leaguebr","br","you","l","feel","veri","much","depress","not","becaus","the","movi","be","bad","it","l","be","becaus","of","the","superstar","imag","go","down","it","take","him","five","full","year","to","regain","it","fulli","back","with","two","movi","chandramukhi","and","sivaji","and","give","fan","back","what","thei","realli","look","for","in","a","superstar","film"],"filtered":["main","aspect","superstar","movi","hi","late","stage","frequenc","lacuna","movi","next","good","establish","star","south","indian","cinema","feedback","receiv","befor","baba","great","br","br","sinc","nattukku","oru","nallavan","numb","movi","act","tamil","mass","hero","year","onli","exactli","rate","per","year","thi","great","hit","imag","mani","think","easili","bring","br","br","padayappa","go","state","hibern","hi","fan","world","especi","south","india","readi","see","movi","ani","kind","superstar","action","tamil","cinema","industri","decid","come","baba","br","br","movi","maker","think","fan","take","whatev","thei","show","superstar","thi","clearli","work","thi","movi","usual","hyp","medium","expect","fan","wai","beyond","limit","br","br","rajinikanth","imag","total","damag","fan","go","nut","movi","collect","meet","expect","level","reput","great","peopl","go","br","br","onli","posit","aspect","thi","movi","song","arrehman","rehman","know","compos","good","music","wrong","movi","like","tajmah","kadal","viru","alli","arjuna","paarthal","paravasam","star","en","swasa","katr","vandicholai","chinnarasu","etc","good","never","think","thi","movi","join","leaguebr","br","l","feel","veri","much","depress","becaus","movi","bad","l","becaus","superstar","imag","go","take","five","full","year","regain","fulli","back","two","movi","chandramukhi","sivaji","give","fan","back","thei","realli","look","superstar","film"],"filtered2":["main","aspect","superstar","late","stage","frequenc","lacuna","next","good","establish","star","south","indian","cinema","feedback","receiv","befor","baba","great","sinc","nattukku","oru","nallavan","numb","act","tamil","mass","hero","year","onli","exactli","rate","per","year","great","hit","imag","mani","think","easili","bring","padayappa","go","state","hibern","fan","world","especi","south","india","readi","see","ani","kind","superstar","action","tamil","cinema","industri","decid","come","baba","maker","think","fan","take","whatev","show","superstar","clearli","work","usual","hyp","medium","expect","fan","wai","beyond","limit","rajinikanth","imag","total","damag","fan","go","nut","collect","meet","expect","level","reput","great","peopl","go","onli","posit","aspect","song","arrehman","rehman","know","compos","good","music","wrong","like","tajmah","kadal","viru","alli","arjuna","paarthal","paravasam","star","en","swasa","katr","vandicholai","chinnarasu","etc","good","never","think","join","leaguebr","l","feel","veri","depress","becaus","bad","l","becaus","superstar","imag","go","take","five","full","year","regain","fulli","back","two","chandramukhi","sivaji","give","fan","back","realli","look","superstar"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,9,11,12,13,15,16,21,22,23,25,26,27,28,30,31,33,34,42,43,47,48,50,51,57,63,79,100,

{"value":"Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn't have animals to domesticate but Europeans did, and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines.<br /><br />But then in the third episode he says that when the Europeans in South Africa got too far north they ran into Zulu people and other tribes that *herded cattle and planted crops*. So what explains their lack of technological, economic, and artistic achievement if they had the key things the author claims are needed for success?<br /><br />Diamond also claims germs in the form of smallpox (brought to North America by black slaves) were our biggest weapon. Well, if 150 Europeans can defeat 20,000 native warriors and 400 non-military South Africans can defeat 10,000 Zulus *without a single casualty* in either case, then I think you have to conclude that germs are irrelevant. With or without germs, we were going to succeed.<br /><br />He says Malaria stopped Europeans from colonizing further North, killing \"thousands\" of Europeans while not affecting Africans. (I'd like to know real numbers but he doesn't say.) Then at the end he says today Malaria is killing thousands of Africans and that is why they can't catch up with us. So which is it, Jared? Did Malaria help the Africans by halting Eurpeans or hurt them? And how come Europe did okay despite massive plagues throughout our history? <br /><br />He also seems far too eager to say that the reasons Europeans succeeded was because of dumb luck. At times when the evidence threatens to overwhelm his rickety theories he's reluctant to admit that maybe Europeans were successful because they worked for it.

{"value":"Well, I saw this movie yesterday and it's - unfortunately - worse than you could think. First of all the plot is idiotic, it has no sense at all. The screenplay is full of intentionally funny dialogues. The audience was laughing many times. And the suspense is very low. Actors play so-so, with an exception of Sharon Stone, who has some good moments but also some awfully bad acting moments. The saddest parts are when she tries to be aggressively sexy and says things like \"I want to *beep* you \" and it looks like, let's say it gently, a very very mature woman acting rude and not sexy at all. That erotic tension from BI1 is totally gone. From the technical point of Basic Instinct 2 is a mediocre movie - better than typical straight to DVD, but on a far lower lever than the original movie. For instance the scene of crazy joyride is done poorly. The director of Basic Instinct 2 is no Paul Verhoeven and it shows. The new composer is no Jerry Goldsmith and its shows. The script is done by people who are no match for Joe Eszterhas. There's no substitute for Michael Douglas in it. The film looks cheap and badly edited at times. I'm sorry but my first thought after I left the theater was: \"Why heaven't they made this movie earlier and with original talents behind the success of the first movie?\" All to all the original movie is like Citizen Kane compared to this. The first Basic Instinct is a classic and was a kind of break-thru in the popular cinema. It was provoking, sexy and controversial. It had the best Sharon Stone's performance in her career. It had this specific Paul Verhoeven's style. Unfortunately Basic Instinct 2 is a unintentionally funny movie, badly directed and a sure Razzie Award Winner in many categories. It's a pity that they made this film.","finished_norm":["good","i","see","thi","movi","yesterdai","and","it","unfortun","wrong","than","you","can","think","of","all","the","plot","be","idiot","it","have","no","sens","at","all","the","screenplai","be","full","of","intention","funni","dialogu","the","audienc","be","laugh","mani","time","and","the","suspens","be","veri","low","actor","plai","soso","with","a","except","of","sharon","stone","who","have","some","good","moment","but","conjur","some","awfulli","bad","act","moment","the","sad","part","be","when","she","try","to","be","aggress","sexi","and","sai","thing","like","i","want","to","beep","you","and","it","look","like","let","sai","it","gentli","a","veri","veri","matur","woman","act","rude","and","not","sexi","at","all","that","erot","tension","from","bi","be","total","go","from","the","technic","point","of","basic","instinct","be","a","mediocr","movi","well","than","typic","straight","to","dvd","but","on","a","far","low","lever","than","the","origin","movi","for","instanc","the","scene","of","crazi","joyrid","be","do","poorli","the","director","of","basic","instinct","be","no","paul","verhoeven","and","it","show","the","new","compos","be","no","jerri","goldsmith","and","it","show","the","script","be","do","by","peopl","who","be","no","match","for","joe","eszterha","there","no","substitut","for","michael","dougla","in","it","the","film","look","cheap","and","badli","edit","at","time","i","be","sorri","but","my","think","after","i","leav","the","theater","be","why","heav","not","thei","make","thi","movi","earli","and","with","origin","talent","behind","the","success","of","the","movi","all","to","all","the","origin","movi","be","like","citizen","kane","compar","to","thi","the","basic","instinct","be","a","classic","and","be","a","kind","of","breakthru","in","the","popular","cinema","it","be","provok","sexi","and","controversi","it","have","the","well","sharon","stone","perform","in","her","career","it","have","thi","specif","paul","verhoeven","styl","unfortun","basic","instinct","be","a","unintention","funni","movi","badli","direct","and","a","sure","razzi","award","winner","in","mani","categori","it","a","piti","that","thei","make","thi","film"],"filtered":["good","see","thi","movi","yesterdai","unfortun","wrong","think","plot","idiot","sens","screenplai","full","intention","funni","dialogu","audienc","laugh","mani","time","suspens","veri","low","actor","plai","soso","except","sharon","stone","good","moment","conjur","awfulli","bad","act","moment","sad","part","try","aggress","sexi","sai","thing","like","want","beep","look","like","let","sai","gentli","veri","veri","matur","woman","act","rude","sexi","erot","tension","bi","total","go","technic","point","basic","instinct","mediocr","movi","well","typic","straight","dvd","far","low","lever","origin","movi","instanc","scene","crazi","joyrid","poorli","director","basic","instinct","paul","verhoeven","show","new","compos","jerri","goldsmith","show","script","peopl","match","joe","eszterha","substitut","michael","dougla","film","look","cheap","badli","edit","time","sorri","think","leav","theater","heav","thei","make","thi","movi","earli","origin","talent","behind","success","movi","origin","movi","like","citizen","kane","compar","thi","basic","instinct","classic","kind","breakthru","popular","cinema","provok","sexi","controversi","well","sharon","stone","perform","career","thi","specif","paul","verhoeven","styl","unfortun","basic","instinct","unintention","funni","movi","badli","direct","sure","razzi","award","winner","mani","categori","piti","thei","make","thi","film"],"filtered2":["good","see","yesterdai","unfortun","wrong","think","plot","idiot","sens","screenplai","full","intention","funni","dialogu","audienc","laugh","mani","time","suspens","veri","low","actor","plai","soso","except","sharon","stone","good","moment","conjur","awfulli","bad","act","moment","sad","part","try","aggress","sexi","thing","like","want","beep","look","like","let","gentli","veri","veri","matur","woman","act","rude","sexi","erot","tension","bi","total","go","technic","point","basic","instinct","mediocr","well","typic","straight","dvd","far","low","lever","origin","instanc","scene","crazi","joyrid","poorli","director","basic","instinct","paul","verhoeven","show","new","compos","jerri","goldsmith","show","script","peopl","match","joe","eszterha","substitut","michael","dougla","look","cheap","badli","edit","time","sorri","think","leav","theater","heav","make","earli","origin","talent","behind","success","origin","like","citizen","kane","compar","basic","instinct","classic","kind","breakthru","popular","cinema","provok","sexi","controversi","well","sharon","stone","perform","career","specif","paul","verhoeven","styl","unfortun","basic","instinct","unintention","funni","badli","direct","sure","razzi","award","winner","mani","categori","piti","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,8,9,12,15,16,19,20,21,23,25,28,29,32,36,37,39,40,41,50,58,61,62,66,

{"value":"In 2005,George W. Bush started with his second period as a President of the United States; North Korea announced its possession of nuclear weapons; Pope John Paul II died after a long illness; and a movie called Into the Blue appeared.The existence of this movie is not as bad as the other things that happened on that year,but the film itself was pathetic and maybe,the worst one from that year.Now,in 2009,the United States have another President,there is another Pope,new Korean nuclear weapons...and the film Into the Blue 2 : The Reef,which is better than the original one...but that's the same as saying : \"getting your fingers cut is better than getting your head cut\".This sequel is a really bad film which kept me tremendously bored and uninterested.The cast of Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is composed by TV-series actors who completely lack of any credibility and dramatic weight,but who are perfect for showing their bodies.Chris Carmack (The O.C.),David Anders (Heroes and Alias),Laura Vandervoort (Smallville),Marsha Tomason (Lost) and Audrina Patridge (The Hills) bring hollow and boring performances.I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially) but on this movie,he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension,emotion or entertainment.The characters from this movie are not only badly performed,but they are also repulsive.Honestly,I wanted all of them to die.The cinematography from this movie is also lame and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels.Into the Blue 2 : The Reef is a horrible movie which is better than the original film,but that's the same as nothing,as I previously said.Avoid this crappy film at all costs.","finished_norm":["in","georg","w","bush","start","with","hi","period","a","a","presid","of","the","unit","state","north","korea","announc","it","possess","of","nuclear","weapon","pope","john","paul","ii","die","after","a","long","ill","and","a","movi","call","into","the","blue","appearedth","exist","of","thi","movi","be","not","a","bad","a","the","other","thing","that","happen","on","that","yearbut","the","film","itself","be","pathet","and","maybeth","wrong","on","from","that","yearnowin","the","unit","state","have","anoth","presidentther","be","anoth","popenew","korean","nuclear","weaponsand","the","film","into","the","blue","the","reefwhich","be","well","than","the","origin","onebut","that","the","same","a","sai","get","your","finger","cut","be","well","than","get","your","head","cutthi","sequel","be","a","realli","bad","film","which","keep","me","tremend","bore","and","uninterestedth","cast","of","into","the","blue","the","reef","be","compos","by","tvseri","actor","who","complet","lack","of","ani","credibl","and","dramat","weightbut","who","be","perfect","for","show","their","bodieschri","carmack","the","ocdavid","ander","hero","and","aliaslaura","vandervoort","smallvillemarsha","tomason","lose","and","audrina","patridg","the","hill","bring","hollow","and","bore","performancesi","have","like","some","previou","movi","from","director","stephen","herek","critter","and","bill","and","ted","excel","adventur","special","but","on","thi","movieh","cannot","gener","even","the","minimum","level","of","tensionemot","or","entertainmentth","charact","from","thi","movi","be","not","onli","badli","performedbut","thei","be","conjur","repulsivehonestlyi","want","all","of","them","to","dieth","cinematographi","from","thi","movi","be","conjur","lame","and","it","seem","to","have","be","make","by","a","technic","team","who","make","promot","video","for","hawaiian","hotelsinto","the","blue","the","reef","be","a","horribl","movi","which","be","well","than","the","origin","filmbut","that","the","same","a","nothinga","i","previous","saidavoid","thi","crappi","film","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["georg","w","bush","start","hi","period","presid","unit","state","north","korea","announc","possess","nuclear","weapon","pope","john","paul","ii","die","long","ill","movi","call","blue","appearedth","exist","thi","movi","bad","thing","happen","yearbut","film","pathet","maybeth","wrong","yearnowin","unit","state","anoth","presidentther","anoth","popenew","korean","nuclear","weaponsand","film","blue","reefwhich","well","origin","onebut","sai","get","finger","cut","well","get","head","cutthi","sequel","realli","bad","film","keep","tremend","bore","uninterestedth","cast","blue","reef","compos","tvseri","actor","complet","lack","ani","credibl","dramat","weightbut","perfect","show","bodieschri","carmack","ocdavid","ander","hero","aliaslaura","vandervoort","smallvillemarsha","tomason","lose","audrina","patridg","hill","bring","hollow","bore","performancesi","like","previou","movi","director","stephen","herek","critter","bill","ted","excel","adventur","special","thi","movieh","gener","even","minimum","level","tensionemot","entertainmentth","charact","thi","movi","onli","badli","performedbut","thei","conjur","repulsivehonestlyi","want","dieth","cinematographi","thi","movi","conjur","lame","seem","make","technic","team","make","promot","video","hawaiian","hotelsinto","blue","reef","horribl","movi","well","origin","filmbut","nothinga","previous","saidavoid","thi","crappi","film","cost"],"filtered2":["georg","w","bush","start","period","presid","unit","state","north","korea","announc","possess","nuclear","weapon","pope","john","paul","ii","die","long","ill","call","blue","appearedth","exist","bad","thing","happen","yearbut","pathet","maybeth","wrong","yearnowin","unit","state","anoth","presidentther","anoth","popenew","korean","nuclear","weaponsand","blue","reefwhich","well","origin","onebut","get","finger","cut","well","get","head","cutthi","sequel","realli","bad","keep","tremend","bore","uninterestedth","cast","blue","reef","compos","tvseri","actor","complet","lack","ani","credibl","dramat","weightbut","perfect","show","bodieschri","carmack","ocdavid","ander","hero","aliaslaura","vandervoort","smallvillemarsha","tomason","lose","audrina","patridg","hill","bring","hollow","bore","performancesi","like","previou","director","stephen","herek","critter","bill","ted","excel","adventur","special","movieh","gener","even","minimum","level","tensionemot","entertainmentth","charact","onli","badli","performedbut","conjur","repulsivehonestlyi","want","dieth","cinematographi","conjur","lame","seem","make","technic","team","make","promot","video","hawaiian","hotelsinto","blue","reef","horribl","well","origin","filmbut","nothinga","previous","saidavoid","crappi","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,9,10,11,13,20,25,27,28,29,35,37,39,41,58,69,71,73,92,94,99,103,108,134,142,183,203,208,221,225,230,240,250,291,293,303,373,375,387,445

{"value":"What has Ireland ever done to film distributers that they seek to represent the country in such a pejorative way? This movie begins like a primer for film students on Irish cinematic cliches: unctuous priests, spitting before handshakes, town square cattle marts, cycling by country meadows to the backdrop of anodyne folk music. Quickly, however, it becomes apparent that the main theme of the film is the big Daddy-O of Irish Cliches - religous strife. It concerns a protestant woman who wants to decide where her Catholic-fathered child is educated, which would seem like a reasonable enough wish, though not to the '50's County Wexford villagers she has to live with. Rather than send them to a Catholic school, she decides to up and leave for Belfast, then Scotland, where a few more cliches are reguritated. While she's there, her father (who looks eerily like George Lucas) and family back home are subjected to a boycott, which turns very nasty. I'm not going to give away the ending, not because I think people should go see this movie, but because it's not very interesting. One of the problems with the film is the central character: we're supposed to sympathise with her but end up instead urging her to get a life. The villagers are presented as bigots whose prejudices should be stood up to, but traumatising your kids seems an innappropriate way to go about it. In addition, it takes on burdens which it staggers igniminiously under when it tries to draw analogies with the current Northern Ireland peace process: the woman is told by her lawyer that she \"must lay down preconditions\" for her return. The film is allegedly based on a true story but it's themes have been dealt with much more imaginatively, and with less recourse to hackneyed cliches, in the past.","finished_norm":["what","have","ireland","ever","do","to","film","distribut","that","thei","seek","to","repres","the","countri","in","such","a","pejor","wai","thi","movi","begin","like","a","primer","for","film","student","on","irish","cinemat","clich","unctuou","priest","spit","befor","handshak","town","squar","cattl","mart","cycl","by","countri","meadow","to","the","backdrop","of","anodyn","folk","music","quickli","howev","it","becom","appar","that","the","main","theme","of","the","film","be","the","big","daddyo","of","irish","clich","relig","strife","it","concern","a","protest","woman","who","want","to","decid","where","her","catholicfath","child","be","educ","which","would","seem","like","a","reason","enough","wish","though","not","to","the","counti","wexford","villag","she","have","to","live","with","rather","than","send","them","to","a","cathol","school","she","decid","to","up","and","leav","for","belfast","then","scotland","where","a","few","much","clich","be","regurit","while","she","there","her","father","who","look","eerili","like","georg","luca","and","famili","back","home","be","subject","to","a","boycott","which","turn","veri","nasti","i","be","not","go","to","give","awai","the","end","not","becaus","i","think","peopl","should","go","see","thi","movi","but","becaus","it","not","veri","interest","on","of","the","problem","with","the","film","be","the","central","charact","we","re","suppos","to","sympathis","with","her","but","end","up","instead","urg","her","to","get","a","life","the","villag","be","present","a","bigot","whose","prejudic","should","be","stand","up","to","but","traumatis","your","kid","seem","a","innappropri","wai","to","go","about","it","in","addit","it","take","on","burden","which","it","stagger","ignimini","under","when","it","try","to","draw","analogi","with","the","current","northern","ireland","peac","process","the","woman","be","tell","by","her","lawyer","that","she","must","lie","down","precondit","for","her","return","the","film","be","allegedli","base","on","a","true","stori","but","it","theme","have","be","deal","with","much","much","imagin","and","with","littl","recours","to","hacknei","clich","in","the","past"],"filtered":["ireland","ever","film","distribut","thei","seek","repres","countri","pejor","wai","thi","movi","begin","like","primer","film","student","irish","cinemat","clich","unctuou","priest","spit","befor","handshak","town","squar","cattl","mart","cycl","countri","meadow","backdrop","anodyn","folk","music","quickli","howev","becom","appar","main","theme","film","big","daddyo","irish","clich","relig","strife","concern","protest","woman","want","decid","catholicfath","child","educ","seem","like","reason","enough","wish","though","counti","wexford","villag","live","rather","send","cathol","school","decid","leav","belfast","scotland","much","clich","regurit","father","look","eerili","like","georg","luca","famili","back","home","subject","boycott","turn","veri","nasti","go","give","awai","end","becaus","think","peopl","go","see","thi","movi","becaus","veri","interest","problem","film","central","charact","re","suppos","sympathis","end","instead","urg","get","life","villag","present","bigot","whose","prejudic","stand","traumatis","kid","seem","innappropri","wai","go","addit","take","burden","stagger","ignimini","try","draw","analogi","current","northern","ireland","peac","process","woman","tell","lawyer","must","lie","precondit","return","film","allegedli","base","true","stori","theme","deal","much","much","imagin","littl","recours","hacknei","clich","past"],"filtered2":["ireland","ever","distribut","seek","repres","countri","pejor","wai","begin","like","primer","student","irish","cinemat","clich","unctuou","priest","spit","befor","handshak","town","squar","cattl","mart","cycl","countri","meadow","backdrop","anodyn","folk","music","quickli","howev","becom","appar","main","theme","big","daddyo","irish","clich","relig","strife","concern","protest","woman","want","decid","catholicfath","child","educ","seem","like","reason","enough","wish","though","counti","wexford","villag","live","rather","send","cathol","school","decid","leav","belfast","scotland","clich","regurit","father","look","eerili","like","georg","luca","famili","back","home","subject","boycott","turn","veri","nasti","go","give","awai","end","becaus","think","peopl","go","see","becaus","veri","interest","problem","central","charact","re","suppos","sympathis","end","instead","urg","get","life","villag","present","bigot","whose","prejudic","stand","traumatis","kid","seem","innappropri","wai","go","addit","take","burden","stagger","ignimini","try","draw","analogi","current","northern","ireland","peac","process","woman","tell","lawyer","must","lie","precondit","return","allegedli","base","true","stori","theme","deal","imagin","littl","recours","hacknei","clich","past"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,10,12,14,15,16,17,22,23,24,30,31,33,35,36,37,44,60,63,68,70,74,75,79,82,86,90,93,95

{"value":"Carrie Fisher has stated on more than one occasion that she made this movie during a period of her life when she had a heavy cocaine problem, and she doesn't remember very much of it. That would explain why she made this film, but it doesn't explain why anyone else in the cast or crew did; I can't believe that EVERYBODY had a coke problem. This has to be one of the absolute worst movies ever made, and that's saying something. The blame can't be laid at the feet of \"director\" Tim Kincaid or \"writer\" Buddy Giovinazzo, as it is obvious that this picture wasn't written or directed by anyone. Apparently it just spontaneously came together, as there is little evidence of coherency, consistency, design, plot, sense, intelligence or anything else. What is really amazing is that there were some actual professionals who were involved in this glop. Co-star Robert Joy has done good work in other films, and composer Jimmie Haskell and cinematographer Arthur Marks are both industry veterans, Marks also having been a director, and not a bad one. Why they got involved in this steaming pile of offal is beyond comprehension. Tim Kincaid, the alleged \"director\", has made quite a few low-rent sci-fi and horror films, and, having seen most of them, I can tell you that not a one of them is any good. This one, though, is by far the worst thing he's ever done, and that is a major accomplishment on his part. Everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, about this movie is 12th-rate--at best. The cinematography is terrible, the acting is laughable, the \"special effects\" make \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" look like \"Spider-Man\", the story is trite, derivative and stupid.

{"value":"I haven't actually finished the film. You may say that in this case I have no right to review it, especially so negatively. But I do, only because I stopped it on account of I couldn't watch anymore...I got over halfway, and I only got there by promising myself something good was just around the corner. This film is so tiresome, so lackluster that I was actually insulted. I haven't read many of the other reviews, so I'm not sure if there are other homosexual teens who have suffered through it, but I am homosexual, and I did go through \"similar\" revelations, day dreams, issues etc etc. There were maybe two moments where I actually felt this film could go somewhere, where I felt it may have some inkling of meaning, or relativity, but these hopes were dashed the moment the next set of cliché-ridden narration came on. I mean, just look at the quotes on the IMDb page. Unfortunately you're not able to hear the scratchy play back, nor the echo-ey fades if you're just read the quotes, because they are just too painful/ridiculous/stupid to miss. I did give the film three stars, and all three of those stars go to the films cinematographer who did a fantastic job attempting to transform Archer's tired \"concepts\" into something watchable. Mind you, I pray he wasn't the one who decided to include all the long shots of TV closeups...another unnecessary cliché already over done in films such as Korine's Gummo... I think it is extremely fitting that this film premiered at Sundance (only because Archer had connections in the festival via volunteer work he did, by the way...) because Sundance seems to be the one festival where cliché heavy drivel like this is still accepted as \"arthouse\".

{"value":"The fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script, is beyond me. This really must be one of the worst films, in addition to \"Haunted Highway\" I have ever seen. BAD actors, and a really bad story. There's no normal reactions to any event in this film, and even though it's Halloween , normal people would have bigger reactions when they're witnessing their father being killed, not to mention gutted, people with tape covering their airways, not being able to breathe (in a room with at least 50 people I might add) and some person dressed up as Satan dragging dead people out of his house, even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person. Not to mention the fact that no one could possibly be that naive and dumb to believe the reality of Satan and Jesus' appearances on the same day, like this kid does. When i was 8, I sure had more brains than that. <br /><br />But, the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling for this mute Satan look-alike as well, no questions asked. The question throughout the film is, is it really Satan, or is it some crazy person killing people off whenever he feels like it? Well, he's got human hands, arms, built and whatever, so I guess he's supposed to be in the movie as well, otherwise they did a lousy job concealing it. Then, with this person being human and all, he was able to kill an old lady, a man and his mistress, 5 (!!???) cops (all with guns and training i presume), and a few other people.....and obviously everyone was just standing there waiting for him, or what?<br /><br />The whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing I've seen, and I would never recommend anyone to

{"value":"Max had the V-8, Trace (Wheels of Fires last and only hero) has a jet engine on the back of his car allowing him to make unintentionally humorous faces as he rockets around the halfway desolate wasteland. Be amazed as Mad Max 2 (aka The Road Warrior) is dissected and spliced back together as a new movie albeit filmed in a lackluster manner with bad actors and lousy stunt work.<br /><br />Why is WoF set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland? Simple, The Road Warrior was! Actually any questions can be answered by: it was that way in the Road Warrior! Except for the out of work mutant actors from the original 60's The Time Machine film that make a cameo appearance for sake of giving the audience some non-vehicular action to chew on for a few minutes.<br /><br />In typical 80's fashion, all cars driven by bad guys that are bumped or slightly jostled explode in a huge billowing explosion. Inevitably all car chases will happen near convenient cliff sides and cars will unavoidably fall off of them. Along with this 80's cinematic wild ride is the general rampant misogyny in this style of cheapie film. Generally I waited for Trace's rocket powered car to accelerate and shoot flames so there would be another shot of him scrunching up his face like he is supposed to be tough, which comes off more as him looking constipated. Badly choreographed action coupled with bad acting makes this film a true sinker. The unintentional humor value even manages to wear thin.<br /><br />Rats: Nights of Terror by Bruno Mattei is superior. And that in and of itself is saying a lot! By this count 2020 Texas Gladiators is a cinematic masterpiece compared to Wheels of Fire. A poor Road Warrior knock off that doesn't have near enough cheese factor to make the film watchable.<br /><br

{"value":"John Huston's Wise Blood was a more horrifying misrepresentation of Flannery O'Connor's book than I could have imagined. From the utterly terrible acting performances (and don't you, \"Oh that was done on purpose, you just don't get it\" me!) to the musical score that was more suited to an episode of Rockford Files, this film was revolting. I viewed it with no ill-will at the outset, and, in fact, expected a pleasant experience. But the misrepresentation of the southern characters, from the ridiculously fraudulent southern drawl to the lilting, comedic way their faith was portrayed, was inexcusable. Right down to it's end, which was completely devoid of any character sentiment, it failed in every place that O'Connor's book shined and resonated. The actors portraying the \"southern\" policemen may as well have been eating smothered hot-dogs from NYC street stands and quoting Godfather. The one redeeming acting performance was Ned Beatty's lively and dead-on representation of Hoover Shoates, a religious con-artist who hears Moates preaching the Church of Christ Without Christ and sees dollar signs and business opportunities. O'Connor's powerful book is most well-known for it's creepy, religious undercurrent that jibes the seemingly lifeless cadaver of \"Faith\". Mr. Huston's film is a shameful mockery of the author's intentions, as they are understood by me and most of her fans, if I may be so bold as to say so. While I acknowledge that I can't know exactly what the author wished to convey, I have enough affection for her and her works to desire to remain a fan. If I viewed Wise Blood the way Mr. Huston apparently did, I would have thrown it in the trash. For Flannery's sake, and mine, I forgive you, John Huston.

{"value":"Be warned! <br /><br />This is crap that other crap won't even deign to be in company with because it's beneath them! Okay, got that out of the way, let me say something more substantive.<br /><br />I've seen Ashes of Time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director, Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite of all of that WKW hasn't succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans; mostly it is just shots of dripping water, beads of sweats, legs of horses running, etc. I couldn't sit through most of the movie.<br /><br />Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr. Wong's movies another shot after hearing many praises, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his latest, 2046. A friend told me to start w/ Chungking Express because it is his most accessible movies. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness. Some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city, blah, blah, blah. It's all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it. But no, he merely shows what is. Faye Wong's acting is very typical of Hong Kong's style: garbled enunciation, deer in the headlight wide eye expression, try to be cute and girlish kind of acting; the rest of the cast is equally

{"value":"First off I want to say that this film is worthy of more than the four stars I rated it. I gave it four stars because for me this 86 minute movie always seems like 2 and a half hours and is not engaging enough to sit through it all. However, \"The Big Alligator River\" (the title my DVD calls it) is better than your average nature strikes back movie.<br /><br />A tourist resort in the jungles of Southeast Asia is just opening and employs the natives while trying to manipulate the wildlife around. Mother Nature seeking revenge comes in the form of the god Kroona, a giant Alligator. But the creature isn't the only thing the tourists and the main characters (a photographer and the resort staff) have to worry about, the natives are getting rubbed the wrong way too.<br /><br />This movie is a pretty well-done adventure/horror story with a good musical score and direction. But the alligator itself, the main attraction of the movie, is obviously fake looking. Some of the close-ups of its jaws are good but that should be all we need to see. Some of the underwater far-away shots make it painfully obvious that what we are really dealing with is an alligator squeaky-toy you can probably get at a zoo souvenir shop. But the natives are believable, if not authentic.<br /><br />Probably not the movie that will give you non-stop thrills, if any, but shot and produced well enough to be given good mention. And like a lot of creature movies, this one ends with an extremely high body count. It also has lots of good jungle scenery. Acting is below par though, but who was expecting it to be better, eh? <br /><br />Much, much better than its recent American counterpart \"Primeival\" but nothing to be compared with \"Jaws\".

{"value":"First To Die 2003<br /><br />I'll admit my mistake first: I didn't realize this was a made for TV movie. I was \"thrown off\" by the \"R\" certification. The plot is strong, but the movie is about 40 minutes too long. The direction and continuity were excellent. For the most part the cast was exceptional and did a good job with their characters. The down side of the movie is that it definitely falls into the \"chick flick\" genre. Although there are some violent scenes, none of the violence should call for an \"R\" rating. There is no nudity or gratuitous sex scenes. Actually, there are no sex scenes. Ona Grauer (who is absolutely beautiful), Kristina Copeland, Sonya Salomaa, and Glynis Davies were all guests on the SG-1 series, but this movie did nothing to advance their careers since they were all used as low level supporting actresses. Robert Patrick was fantastic, as he usually is and Mitch Pileggi made me think of a modern day Lee Marvin. The very talented Megan Gallagher who I came to respect as an actor during the Millennium series, was given nothing challenging to show her range of abilities. The greatest disappointment with regard to the cast was Tracy Pollan. Aside from being a below average actress and not particularly attractive, her voice is absolutely annoying. I found myself muting the TV during her dialogue. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the Lifetime TV type of programs. I would not recommend paying any money to see this movie however. Considering I found nothing that would cause censorship, this is a movie that is worthy for only watching on TV, since nothing will be cut out. As a TV movie I would rate this as a 5 out 10. As a feature film with an \"R\" certification and such as strong cast, I rate it as a 2 out of ten.","finished_norm":["to","die","br","br","i","will","admit","my","mistak","i","do","not","realiz","thi","be","a","make","for","tv","movi","i","be","throw","off","by","the","r","certif","the","plot","be","strong","but","the","movi","be","about","minut","too","long","the","direct","and","continu","be","excel","for","the","much","part","the","cast","be","except","and","do","a","good","job","with","their","charact","the","down","side","of","the","movi","be","that","it","definit","fall","into","the","chick","flick","genr","although","there","be","some","violent","scene","none","of","the","violenc","should","call","for","a","r","rate","there","be","no","nuditi","or","gratuit","sex","scene","actual","there","be","no","sex","scene","ona","grauer","who","be","absolut","beauti","kristina","copeland","sonya","salomaa","and","glyni","davi","be","all","guest","on","the","sg","seri","but","thi","movi","do","noth","to","advanc","their","career","sinc","thei","be","all","us","a","low","level","support","actress","robert","patrick","be","fantast","a","he","usual","be","and","mitch","pileggi","make","me","think","of","a","modern","dai","lee","marvin","the","veri","talent","megan","gallagh","who","i","come","to","respect","a","a","actor","dure","the","millennium","seri","be","give","noth","challeng","to","show","her","rang","of","abil","the","great","disappoint","with","regard","to","the","cast","be","traci","pollan","asid","from","be","a","below","averag","actress","and","not","particularli","attract","her","voic","be","absolut","annoi","i","find","myself","mute","the","tv","dure","her","dialogu","i","would","recommend","thi","movi","to","anyon","who","enjoi","the","lifetim","tv","typ","of","program","i","would","not","recommend","pai","ani","monei","to","see","thi","movi","howev","consid","i","find","noth","that","would","caus","censorship","thi","be","a","movi","that","be","worthi","for","onli","watch","on","tv","sinc","noth","will","be","cut","out","a","a","tv","movi","i","would","rate","thi","a","a","out","a","a","featur","film","with","a","r","certif","and","such","a","strong","cast","i","rate","it","a","a","out","of","ten"],"filtered":["die","br","br","admit","mistak","realiz","thi","make","tv","movi","throw","r","certif","plot","strong","movi","minut","long","direct","continu","excel","much","part","cast","except","good","job","charact","side","movi","definit","fall","chick","flick","genr","although","violent","scene","none","violenc","call","r","rate","nuditi","gratuit","sex","scene","actual","sex","scene","ona","grauer","absolut","beauti","kristina","copeland","sonya","salomaa","glyni","davi","guest","sg","seri","thi","movi","noth","advanc","career","sinc","thei","us","low","level","support","actress","robert","patrick","fantast","usual","mitch","pileggi","make","think","modern","dai","lee","marvin","veri","talent","megan","gallagh","come","respect","actor","dure","millennium","seri","give","noth","challeng","show","rang","abil","great","disappoint","regard","cast","traci","pollan","asid","averag","actress","particularli","attract","voic","absolut","annoi","find","mute","tv","dure","dialogu","recommend","thi","movi","anyon","enjoi","lifetim","tv","typ","program","recommend","pai","ani","monei","see","thi","movi","howev","consid","find","noth","caus","censorship","thi","movi","worthi","onli","watch","tv","sinc","noth","cut","tv","movi","rate","thi","featur","film","r","certif","strong","cast","rate","ten"],"filtered2":["die","admit","mistak","realiz","make","tv","throw","r","certif","plot","strong","minut","long","direct","continu","excel","part","cast","except","good","job","charact","side","definit","fall","chick","flick","genr","although","violent","scene","none","violenc","call","r","rate","nuditi","gratuit","sex","scene","actual","sex","scene","ona","grauer","absolut","beauti","kristina","copeland","sonya","salomaa","glyni","davi","guest","sg","noth","advanc","career","sinc","us","low","level","support","actress","robert","patrick","fantast","usual","mitch","pileggi","make","think","modern","dai","lee","marvin","veri","talent","megan","gallagh","come","respect","actor","dure","millennium","give","noth","challeng","show","rang","abil","great","disappoint","regard","cast","traci","pollan","asid","averag","actress","particularli","attract","voic","absolut","annoi","find","mute","tv","dure","dialogu","recommend","anyon","enjoi","lifetim","tv","typ","program","recommend","pai","ani","monei","see","howev","consid","find","noth","caus","censorship","worthi","onli","watch","tv","sinc","noth","cut","tv","rate","featur","r","certif","strong","cast","rate","ten"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,10,11,12,15,19,27,28,30,32,34,38,41,49,51,52,56,59,61,92,99,102,113,126,132,142,158,162,169,172,187,200,202,217,222,232,237,239,248,254,257,265,271,276,289,293,298,303,305,310,317,322,325,355,370,384,392,405,425,428,433,445,452,453,459,467,497,511,539,545,570,580,592,612,631,643,648,691,694,729,847,936,966,101

{"value":"Of the many problems with this film, the worst is continuity; and re-editing it on VHS for a college cable channel many years ago, I tried to figure out what exactly went wrong. What seems to have happened is that they actually constructed a much longer film and then chopped it down for standard theatrical viewing. How much longer? to fill in all the holes in the plot as we have it would require about three more hours of narrative and character development - especially given the fact that the film we do have is just so slow and takes itself just so seriously.<br /><br />That's staggering; what could the Halperins have possibly been trying to accomplish here? Their previous film, \"White Zombie\", was a successful low budget attempt to duplicate the early Universal Studios monster films (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.), and as such stuck pretty close to the zombie mythology that those in North America would know from popular magazines.<br /><br />Revolt of the Zombies, to the contrary, appears to have been intended as some allegory for the politics of modern war. This would not only explain the opening, and the change of Dean Jagger's character into a megalomaniac, but it also explains why the zombies don't actually do much in the film, besides stand around, look frightening, and wait for orders - they're just allegorical soldiers, not the undead cannibals we've all come to love and loathe in zombie films.<br /><br />I am the equal to any in my dislike for modern war and its politics - but I think a film ought to be entertaining first, and only later, maybe, educational. And definitely - a film about zombies ought to be about zombies.<br /><br />Truly one of the most bizarre films in Hollywood history, but not one I can recommend, even for historic value.","finished_norm":["of","the","mani","problem","with","thi","film","the","wrong","be","continu","and","reedit","it","on","vh","for","a","colleg","cabl","channel","mani","year","ago","i","try","to","figur","out","what","exactli","go","wrong","what","seem","to","have","happen","be","that","thei","actual","construct","a","much","long","film","and","then","chop","it","down","for","standard","theatric","view","how","much","long","to","fill","in","all","the","hole","in","the","plot","a","we","have","it","would","requir","about","three","much","hour","of","narr","and","charact","develop","especi","give","the","fact","that","the","film","we","do","have","be","just","so","slow","and","take","itself","just","so","seriouslybr","br","that","stagger","what","can","the","halperin","have","possibli","be","try","to","accomplish","here","their","previou","film","white","zombi","be","a","success","low","budget","attempt","to","duplic","the","earli","univers","studio","monster","film","the","mummi","dracula","etc","and","a","such","stick","pretti","close","to","the","zombi","mythologi","that","that","in","north","america","would","know","from","popular","magazinesbr","br","revolt","of","the","zombi","to","the","contrari","appear","to","have","be","intend","a","some","allegori","for","the","polit","of","modern","war","thi","would","not","onli","explain","the","open","and","the","chang","of","dean","jagger","charact","into","a","megalomaniac","but","it","conjur","explain","why","the","zombi","do","not","actual","do","much","in","the","film","besid","stand","around","look","frighten","and","wait","for","order","thei","re","just","allegor","soldier","not","the","undead","cannib","we","have","all","come","to","love","and","loath","in","zombi","filmsbr","br","i","be","the","equal","to","ani","in","my","dislik","for","modern","war","and","it","polit","but","i","think","a","film","ought","to","be","entertain","and","onli","late","mayb","educ","and","definit","a","film","about","zombi","ought","to","be","about","zombiesbr","br","truli","on","of","the","much","bizarr","film","in","hollywood","histori","but","not","on","i","can","recommend","even","for","histor","valu"],"filtered":["mani","problem","thi","film","wrong","continu","reedit","vh","colleg","cabl","channel","mani","year","ago","try","figur","exactli","go","wrong","seem","happen","thei","actual","construct","much","long","film","chop","standard","theatric","view","much","long","fill","hole","plot","requir","three","much","hour","narr","charact","develop","especi","give","fact","film","slow","take","seriouslybr","br","stagger","halperin","possibli","try","accomplish","previou","film","white","zombi","success","low","budget","attempt","duplic","earli","univers","studio","monster","film","mummi","dracula","etc","stick","pretti","close","zombi","mythologi","north","america","know","popular","magazinesbr","br","revolt","zombi","contrari","appear","intend","allegori","polit","modern","war","thi","onli","explain","open","chang","dean","jagger","charact","megalomaniac","conjur","explain","zombi","actual","much","film","besid","stand","around","look","frighten","wait","order","thei","re","allegor","soldier","undead","cannib","come","love","loath","zombi","filmsbr","br","equal","ani","dislik","modern","war","polit","think","film","entertain","onli","late","mayb","educ","definit","film","zombi","zombiesbr","br","truli","much","bizarr","film","hollywood","histori","recommend","even","histor","valu"],"filtered2":["mani","problem","wrong","continu","reedit","vh","colleg","cabl","channel","mani","year","ago","try","figur","exactli","go","wrong","seem","happen","actual","construct","long","chop","standard","theatric","view","long","fill","hole","plot","requir","three","hour","narr","charact","develop","especi","give","fact","slow","take","seriouslybr","stagger","halperin","possibli","try","accomplish","previou","white","zombi","success","low","budget","attempt","duplic","earli","univers","studio","monster","mummi","dracula","etc","stick","pretti","close","zombi","mythologi","north","america","know","popular","magazinesbr","revolt","zombi","contrari","appear","intend","allegori","polit","modern","war","onli","explain","open","chang","dean","jagger","charact","megalomaniac","conjur","explain","zombi","actual","besid","stand","around","look","frighten","wait","order","re","allegor","soldier","undead","cannib","come","love","loath","zombi","filmsbr","equal","ani","dislik","modern","war","polit","think","entertain","onli","late","mayb","educ","definit","zombi","zombiesbr","truli","bizarr","hollywood","histori","recommend","even","histor","valu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,10,11,12,16,25,26,27,30,31,32,34,35,36,39,50,52,54,57,68,78,94,97,98,99,150,163,167,170,174,177,195,217,224,242,256,266,267,268,278,295,298,300,312,314,320,331,342,359,377,390,392,395,413,415,416,429,433,439,451,462,499,532,553,558,575,610,616,657,728,729,784,808,810,814,823,906,913,926,932,951,953,972,

{"value":"The only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern France and the voice of Nana Mascouri singing the theme song. Stephanie Powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent. As has been pointed out, she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter? Lee Remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years. The talented Joanna Lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son (Robert Urich) finally marries Grandma Stephanie Powers. Stacey Keach's ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him. Don't know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal? The most credible performance is given by Ian Richardson, who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs. It strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them. Can anybody believe that handsome Robert Urich would remain single for decades waiting for Stephanie Powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals? The WW2 engagement between the Wehrmacht and the Marquis is laughable. To begin with, the Germans did not occupy the Provence section of France until late in the war, it was controlled by the Vichy French puppet government. We see the French resistance staging a daylight raid on Mistral's villa to steal sheets after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a lumbering truckload of Nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them? If you want to see a well acted mini-series set in a foreign country, don't watch Mistral's Daughter.

{"value":"I had a lot of expectations from this movie and more so since it was a Yashraj Film.<br /><br />Jimmy operates a call centre and one day he is invited by Pooja Singh to teach her boss, Lakhan Singh, English. The two fall in love and decide to run away but Pooja tells Jimmy that she can't do this as she owes a debt to Lakhan Singh, who is also known as Bhaiyyaji. But they decide and steal money from him and its only then that Jimmy finds out that Bhaiyyaji / Lakhan Singh is a Don. In the meantime, Bhaiyyaji hires a man, Bachchan Pandey, to track down Jimmy and Pooja.<br /><br />Starring Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Kumar, the movie is directed by first time director Viay Krishna Acharya and is produced by both Aditya Chopra and Yash Chopra.<br /><br />\"Tashan\" has to be one of the worse films that I have ever watched. Yes! The scenery is good and Kareena Kapoor (and her much publicised weight loss) looks good. But plot is extremely thin on story and at times makes no sense from one scene to the other - hence why I have said at the beginning that I had expected more from this film as it was a Yashraj Production. With reference to songs, unfortunately, there is not one song that I can remember now.<br /><br />There are moments where one can laugh and that is mainly thanks to Akshaye Kumar and Saif could have definitely done better while Kareena Kapoor played her part well. But this cannot be said for Anil Kapoor - it did not suit him at all as a villain. Lastly,never mind Aditya Chopra, who in the past has produced and directed good films such as \"Mohabbatein,\" what was Yash Chopra doing by producing such a trash movie? <br /><br />Conclusion: Bad movie, not worth wasting your time and that is my first and last
