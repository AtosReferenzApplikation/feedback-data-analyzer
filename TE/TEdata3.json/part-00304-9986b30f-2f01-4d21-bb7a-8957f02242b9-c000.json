{"value":"It's hard to believe people actually LIKE this dreck! I do think kids can enjoy it, but to me it's the kind of kid film parents can't bear to sit through. Predictable plot, boring Belushi, and possibly the worst kid actor of all time. I will give the director some of the responsibility for the kid, but she was truly painful to watch. I feel embarrassed for her now, having people know it was her. When she sang the Star Spangled Banner I had to turn the sound off--then I came here and discovered they did that because she won Star Search. I've always felt Jim Belushi should be ashamed to trade on the name of his wonderful, sadly missed brother, and this crap shows why. Zero stars.","finished_norm":["it","hard","to","believ","peopl","actual","like","thi","dreck","i","do","think","kid","can","enjoi","it","but","to","me","it","the","kind","of","kid","film","parent","ca","not","bear","to","sit","through","predict","plot","bore","belushi","and","possibli","the","wrong","kid","actor","of","all","time","i","will","give","the","director","some","of","the","respons","for","the","kid","but","she","be","truli","pain","to","watch","i","feel","embarrass","for","her","now","have","peopl","know","it","be","her","when","she","sing","the","star","spangl","banner","i","have","to","turn","the","sound","offthen","i","come","here","and","discov","thei","do","that","becaus","she","win","star","search","i","have","alwai","feel","jim","belushi","should","be","asham","to","trade","on","the","name","of","hi","wonder","sadli","miss","brother","and","thi","crap","show","why","zero","star"],"filtered":["hard","believ","peopl","actual","like","thi","dreck","think","kid","enjoi","kind","kid","film","parent","ca","bear","sit","predict","plot","bore","belushi","possibli","wrong","kid","actor","time","give","director","respons","kid","truli","pain","watch","feel","embarrass","peopl","know","sing","star","spangl","banner","turn","sound","offthen","come","discov","thei","becaus","win","star","search","alwai","feel","jim","belushi","asham","trade","name","hi","wonder","sadli","miss","brother","thi","crap","show","zero","star"],"filtered2":["hard","believ","peopl","actual","like","dreck","think","kid","enjoi","kind","kid","parent","ca","bear","sit","predict","plot","bore","belushi","possibli","wrong","kid","actor","time","give","director","respons","kid","truli","pain","watch","feel","embarrass","peopl","know","sing","star","spangl","banner","turn","sound","offthen","come","discov","becaus","win","star","search","alwai","feel","jim","belushi","asham","trade","name","wonder","sadli","miss","brother","crap","show","zero","star"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,8,12,22,23,25,26,28,30,32,34,41,43,52,58,81,91,96,100,108,114,122,143,171,175,178,197,200,244,255,313,337,343,381,459,489,525,557,558,659,670,705,782,915,964,1089,1358,1585,2504,2802,5516],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,8,12,22,23,25,26,28,30,32,34,41,43,52,58,81,91,96,100,108,114,122,143,171,175,178,197,200,244,255,313,337,343,381,459,489,525,557,558,659,670,705,782,915,964,1089,1358,1585,2504,2802,5516],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.5687599167621034,3.321622407243643,1.7122153074726136,1.865701314626681,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.0390708128715254,6.421638720953344,2.138507503627933,9.77322967838673,2.2489347673732487,2.3409902041158843,2.373087554090762,2.3791142619576227,2.532833256045391,2.558331832813986,2.5308211829319704,2.634508058031767,2.6754694156628323,2.907069060519773,2.973659465713028,2.9705344631698933,3.24941502915308,3.2829611516442836,3.3956930001684253,3.4149707055943286,3.43462735814388,3.4572130107926293,3.8023521382691974,3.7264536553416874,3.6284289511740746,3.7810747398219124,3.9363956947973615,4.062925891962901,4.2078172463773615,4.798834931860927,4.597282013139085,5.156897801074508,5.373120909544144,13.200701152068694]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.66094771775053E-5,7.609288156306367E-5,7.66844311589143E-5,7.624134769873149E-5,7.624259682737537E-5,7.613602491319274E-5,7.636246411892889E-5,7.610383844080296E-5,7.62749476127575E-5,0.1352070971658989,0.6919354053580914,7.598099006651652E-5,7.739913756735739E-5,0.1669576930550413,7.603639461184696E-5,7.582626282375503E-5,7.771765409902142E-5,7.636961870540878E-5,7.613268226087727E-5,7.619578271831113E-5,7.693302160583587E-5,7.64452816724036E-5,7.653232622282824E-5,7.661478122053548E-5,7.720276030579708E-5,7.679901160363813E-5,8.002749615477702E-5,7.600357851819634E-5,7.600561179191279E-5,7.619817157957466E-5,7.781774587831349E-5,7.636519373814505E-5,8.197156645091041E-5,7.657999775917915E-5,7.608630499544272E-5,7.643749344960535E-5,7.601006461645443E-5,7.605498097222602E-5,7.58258818664798E-5,7.584555459852378E-5,7.601627372418709E-5,7.681808433814488E-5,7.64277393702337E-5,7.612556545329975E-5,7.705057089608747E-5,7.615478286130694E-5,7.868502812588931E-5,7.752794185192809E-5,7.586440636516212E-5,7.603207134265598E-5,7.600570055579308E-5,7.814478667806887E-5,7.603320255492887E-5,7.583882124642955E-5,7.667126084332392E-5,7.605278668949608E-5,8.178641366709825E-5,7.599010931115753E-5,7.586352903682452E-5,7.622575512203002E-5,7.698185054969673E-5,7.622071235474942E-5,7.584949411435036E-5,7.602609804449132E-5,7

{"value":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie. Its like a low budget made for TV Canadian movie. Absolutely the worst movie I have ever seen and there have been many others out there. This movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD player or VCR. :~( . Is it possible to write ten lines? The acting was horrific. It had absolutely no flow. I saw the made for TV movie on the BTK killer and it was much better(in comparison to this one). I am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the BTK killer they missed by a mile. It appeared to be more of a infomercial for animal

{"value":"I expect the same excitement as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE but I was let down by just junk how can you even call this a movie ( its kinda of a mini porno) . It made my sick when the guy was made to eat his own business. There is no story line to it at all it jumps to quickly from each murder. If you like seeing a women naked or even mens parts then there's spots in the movie for and there's even a masturbation spot in the movie which makes it a porno and not a movie at all. I have seen some dumb movies in my time but this is number 1 . I want be watching it again at all. The actors even look bored during the movie to me so they probably were in need of money badly to make this movie.","finished_norm":["i","expect","the","same","excit","a","i","spit","on","your","grave","but","i","be","let","down","by","just","junk","how","can","you","even","call","thi","a","movi","it","kinda","of","a","mini","porno","it","make","my","sick","when","the","gui","be","make","to","eat","hi","own","busi","there","be","no","stori","line","to","it","at","all","it","jump","to","quickli","from","each","murder","if","you","like","see","a","woman","nake","or","even","men","part","then","there","spot","in","the","movi","for","and","there","even","a","masturb","spot","in","the","movi","which","make","it","a","porno","and","not","a","movi","at","all","i","have","see","some","dumb","movi","in","my","time","but","thi","be","numb","i","want","be","watch","it","again","at","all","the","actor","even","look","bore","dure","the","movi","to","me","so","thei","probabl","be","in","ne","of","monei","badli","to","make","thi","movi"],"filtered":["expect","excit","spit","grave","let","junk","even","call","thi","movi","kinda","mini","porno","make","sick","gui","make","eat","hi","busi","stori","line","jump","quickli","murder","like","see","woman","nake","even","men","part","spot","movi","even","masturb","spot","movi","make","porno","movi","see","dumb","movi","time","thi","numb","want","watch","actor","even","look","bore","dure","movi","thei","probabl","ne","monei","badli","make","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["expect","excit","spit","grave","let","junk","even","call","kinda","mini","porno","make","sick","gui","make","eat","busi","stori","line","jump","quickli","murder","like","see","woman","nake","even","men","part","spot","even","masturb","spot","make","porno","see","dumb","time","numb","want","watch","actor","even","look","bore","dure","probabl","ne","monei","badli","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,7,8,16,17,37,41,55,61,70,107,108,110,124,126,130,142,148,239,273,420,448,516,524,599,674,771,778,790,893,1006,1397,1444,1482,2215,2315,3078,3701],"values":[4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,7,8,16,17,37,41,55,61,70,107,108,110,124,126,130,142,148,239,273,420,448,516,524,599,674,771,778,790,893,1006,1397,1444,1482,2215,2315,3078,3701],"values":[2.479906862482093,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,3.704068422904524,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.9536997889255368,1.8818517047392527,2.094675786251684,2.1439533986393955,2.138507503627933,2.1290479736304078,2.2323930368088845,2.2391270689902285,2.2642139034199635,2.2844323215331563,2.3018654096236517,2.6593400337329487,2.9674191958529437,3.3023374306074227,3.2681460658591432,3.442099372982581,3.4028786598293,3.6254214301101193,3.6405503117064195,3.7264536553416874,3.8059428063999263,3.749984152751882,4.017463517886143,8.125851783925802,4.422928625994308,4.573751515728891,4.506310234933358,5.00274712124725,10.428112429828913,5.907203395474402,5.7959777603641776]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.463576376590255E-5,9.399761268679357E-5,9.472835449409015E-5,9.418101305264834E-5,9.418255610251122E-5,9.405090771035084E-5,9.43306282876331E-5,9.401114772882168E-5,9.422251906004417E-5,1.0453474149246365E-4,0.7231630476265593,9.385939300921877E-5,9.561123203513747E-5,9.697514726935112E-5,9.392783429946931E-5,9.366825829151018E-5,9.600469582521464E-5,9.433946635546621E-5,9.404677852860291E-5,9.412472658677064E-5,9.503543852175973E-5,9.443293289425694E-5,9.454045911443999E-5,9.464231585556171E-5,9.536864700755718E-5,9.486989583203651E-5,9.885804602650304E-5,9.388729654616703E-5,9.38898082512222E-5,9.412767754947832E-5,9.612833930026468E-5,9.433400018898042E-5,0.26944866774173265,9.45993478109652E-5,9.398948864623494E-5,9.442331209484614E-5,9.389530882983125E-5,9.39507940490317E-5,9.366778769460713E-5,9.369208944017354E-5,9.390297894682243E-5,9.48934564000452E-5,9.44112628708444E-5,9.403798712908569E-5,9.518064727755537E-5,9.407407942241402E-5,9.71996939279666E-5,9.577034409667035E-5,9.37153770463534E-5,9.392249376071448E-5,9.388991790133229E-5,9.653233312723924E-5,9.392389114836638E-5,9.368377172359826E-5,9.471208519007118E-5,9.394808344938114E-5,1.0103083858836922E-4,9.387065802124293E-5,9.371429328178067E-5,9.416175152705662E-5,9.509575696493938E-5,9.41555221915922E-5,9.369695592801359E-5,9.391511493951846E-5,9.366892062308E-5,9.583622529953868E-5,9.447583440412707E-5,9.427458704436685E-5,9.419213965721161E-5,9.453548497895266E-5,9.366550343230156E-5,9.419411435129568E-5,9.572188035581914E-5,9.383335721718813E-5,9.615568391803317E-5,9.408144308068938E-5,9.481777162960925E-5,9.423828712117181E-5,9.363613653830937E-5,9.375220496053295E-5]}}
{"value":"Wendy Wu: Homecoming Warrior has a very good, strong plot but is ruined by cheesy details throughout the movie. I am a younger teenager and didn't enjoy this movie very much. I thought the effects were horrible, but they might seem entertaining to younger children. The matrix moves ruined the action, you know that it was absolutely fake. Then there was the Yen Lo, an evil spirit who temporarily possesses random people and homecoming in which Wendy was striving to win. It all ends like a typical feel good movie when Wendy and her Buddhist monk cousin Shen defeat Yen Lo (and destroy him forever) in the end. So Wendy learns a lesson...blah, blah, blah.

{"value":"My first opinions on this movie were of course bad.I was expecting a horrible, crappy acting, bad entertainment, ridiculous special effects movie.What I got was actually not that bad.The special effects were absolutely horrible, but I found the movie itself quite interesting, and the script was actually pretty good and decent.The acting wasn't THAT bad, and overall I had fun watching this movie.It's still a pretty bad film, but it's not completely worthless like I thought it was going to be, and I'm pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me, even when it wasn't that good.Overall, it's a film that should be avoided, but to me it wasn't as bad as I was expecting it to be.","finished_norm":["my","opinion","on","thi","movi","be","of","cours","badi","be","expect","a","horribl","crappi","act","bad","entertain","ridicul","special","effect","moviewhat","i","get","be","actual","not","that","badth","special","effect","be","absolut","horribl","but","i","find","the","movi","itself","quit","interest","and","the","script","be","actual","pretti","good","and","decentth","act","be","not","that","bad","and","overal","i","have","fun","watch","thi","movieit","still","a","pretti","bad","film","but","it","not","complet","worthless","like","i","think","it","be","go","to","be","and","i","be","pleas","to","know","that","thi","movi","manag","to","wow","me","even","when","it","be","not","that","goodoveral","it","a","film","that","should","be","avoid","but","to","me","it","be","not","a","bad","a","i","be","expect","it","to","be"],"filtered":["opinion","thi","movi","cours","badi","expect","horribl","crappi","act","bad","entertain","ridicul","special","effect","moviewhat","get","actual","badth","special","effect","absolut","horribl","find","movi","quit","interest","script","actual","pretti","good","decentth","act","bad","overal","fun","watch","thi","movieit","still","pretti","bad","film","complet","worthless","like","think","go","pleas","know","thi","movi","manag","wow","even","goodoveral","film","avoid","bad","expect"],"filtered2":["opinion","cours","badi","expect","horribl","crappi","act","bad","entertain","ridicul","special","effect","moviewhat","get","actual","badth","special","effect","absolut","horribl","find","quit","interest","script","actual","pretti","good","decentth","act","bad","overal","fun","watch","movieit","still","pretti","bad","complet","worthless","like","think","go","pleas","know","manag","wow","even","goodoveral","avoid","bad","expect"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,7,9,12,21,26,38,52,60,64,77,78,103,106,120,130,195,199,203,222,230,259,274,335,345,346,412,538,1003,1077,1890,6843],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,7,9,12,21,26,38,52,60,64,77,78,103,106,120,130,195,199,203,222,230,259,274,335,345,346,412,538,1003,1077,1890,6843],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,4.273428342688829,1.066728610262888,2.324031090670098,1.3324924169710188,1.519311641348122,3.4244306149452273,1.838176641236591,1.883428577602134,1.9463902258768238,4.012839573363895,2.098582041218749,4.318168722633384,2.2044500422972613,4.528427806839927,2.51289241584188,2.558331832813986,5.139521057275218,2.5771019354959765,5.424276438599839,2.7464553122240485,2.748952192422636,2.908534262247101,3.0022328381570844,3.023389038124396,3.107414446935464,3.43462735814388,4.035401218572811,4.235066888824737,4.85885294158718,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.215820938105771E-4,1.2076223732843918E-4,1.217010485709396E-4,1.2099785861577202E-4,1.2099984102945705E-4,1.208307074320863E-4,1.2119007488593819E-4,1.2077962630153038E-4,1.2105118293085215E-4,1.342996795380693E-4,0.8757792401801803,1.2058466135571349E-4,1.2283531426233714E-4,1.245875870116335E-4,1.2067259043284698E-4,1.2033910345821094E-4,1.2334081186210887E-4,1.2120142948117395E-4,1.208254025183554E-4,1.2092554529465235E-4,1.220955708696364E-4,1.2132150942806924E-4,1.2145965237180593E-4,1.215905115244296E-4,1.2252365623363179E-4,1.218828920045789E-4,1.2700661724098902E-4,1.2062051006989816E-4,1.2062373695102099E-4,1.2092933650645727E-4,0.11472216284405591,1.211944068933064E-4,1.3009192921317734E-4,1.2153530887565179E-4,1.2075180007066245E-4,1.2130914922839472E-4,1.2063080374942623E-4,1.2070208767906847E-4,1.2033849886482534E-4,1.2036972022334395E-4,1.2064065783467318E-4,1.2191316114465736E-4,1.2129366914111451E-4,1.2081410787964487E-4,1.222821259717111E-4,1.208604769944347E-4,1.248760704752443E-4,1.2303973145961933E-4,1.2039963867918468E-4,1.206657292436089E-4,1.2062387782260528E-4,1.2401868717478034E-4,1.2066752451962107E-4,1.2035903414276825E-4,1.2168014678953315E-4,1.2069860527064399E-4,1.297980848487447E-4,1.2059913393663003E-4,1.2039824632643442E-4,1.2097311261575852E-4,1.2217306422231139E-4,1.2096510955625254E-4,1.2037597238169879E-4,1.2065624939692973E-4,1.2033995438027098E-4,1.231243714970507E-4,1.2137662659720362E-4,1.2111807661144957E-4,1.2101215337946359E-4,1.2145326191450543E-4,1.2033556418788217E-4,1.2101469034257164E-4,1.2297746828497893E-4,1.2055121220305562E-4,1.235347918939154E-4,1.208699373607444E-4,1.2181592609848666E-4,1.2107144074682935E-4,1.20297835444348E-4,1.2044695287350661E-4]}}
{"value":"I found this film to be quite an oddity. From the very get go I found it extremely hard to like this movie, and now after a little thinking about it I can pretty much pinpoint the reason why. Jean-Marc Barr, although I love him to bits (I think Zentropa is one of the best movies ever made) is quite miscast here, and although I can't figure for the life of me who would be better, I am sure someone could have taken his place quite easily and make this film work.

{"value":"I'm glad the folks at IMDb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into. I had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy, but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama I wasn't sure. For a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour - right up until the ridiculous \"twist\" ending, which confirms what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is. It is hard to describe just how amateurish THE HAZING really is. Did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing? Actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack-jawed disbelief at how terrible it is.","finished_norm":["i","be","glad","the","folk","at","imdb","be","abl","to","deciph","what","genr","thi","film","fall","into","i","have","a","suspicion","it","be","try","to","be","a","comedi","but","sinc","it","conjur","seem","to","want","to","be","a","dark","and","solemn","melodrama","i","be","not","sure","for","a","comedi","it","be","amazingli","bereav","of","even","the","slight","ventur","into","the","realm","of","humour","right","up","until","the","ridicul","twist","end","which","confirm","what","a","utter","wast","of","time","the","whole","movi","actual","be","it","be","hard","to","describ","just","how","amateurish","the","haze","realli","be","do","anyon","involv","in","thi","film","have","ani","idea","at","all","what","thei","be","suppos","to","be","do","actual","worth","watch","so","that","you","can","stare","at","the","screen","in","slackjaw","disbelief","at","how","terribl","it","be"],"filtered":["glad","folk","imdb","abl","deciph","genr","thi","film","fall","suspicion","try","comedi","sinc","conjur","seem","want","dark","solemn","melodrama","sure","comedi","amazingli","bereav","even","slight","ventur","realm","humour","right","ridicul","twist","end","confirm","utter","wast","time","whole","movi","actual","hard","describ","amateurish","haze","realli","anyon","involv","thi","film","ani","idea","thei","suppos","actual","worth","watch","stare","screen","slackjaw","disbelief","terribl"],"filtered2":["glad","folk","imdb","abl","deciph","genr","fall","suspicion","try","comedi","sinc","conjur","seem","want","dark","solemn","melodrama","sure","comedi","amazingli","bereav","even","slight","ventur","realm","humour","right","ridicul","twist","end","confirm","utter","wast","time","whole","actual","hard","describ","amateurish","haze","realli","anyon","involv","ani","idea","suppos","actual","worth","watch","stare","screen","slackjaw","disbelief","terribl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,8,13,24,27,35,36,37,39,52,89,111,119,121,123,127,149,158,162,166,170,171,192,219,241,274,368,435,454,467,592,668,1005,1024,1188,1227,1243,1440,1557,1782,2235,2601,2988,3396,4065,4713,6550,7821,8021],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,8,13,24,27,35,36,37,39,52,89,111,119,121,123,127,149,158,162,166,170,171,192,219,241,274,368,435,454,467,592,668,1005,1024,1188,1227,1243,1440,1557,1782,2235,2601,2988,3396,4065,4713,6550,7821,8021],"values":[0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1317941569733974,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,3.4244306149452273,1.9940046109572438,2.1183455303375887,2.1653408989309972,2.2190595059394194,2.2619070973220485,4.871935874217273,2.3253197803590226,2.3106972614914807,2.3586007221245198,2.4423870329693536,2.4071371113909277,2.373087554090762,2.5318267134339894,2.5792094178355414,2.6627744961815836,2.748952192422636,3.1346146732346205,3.2829611516442836,3.2556198060399626,3.342254038012865,3.509308122676031,3.5813614403160887,4.086456389373095,4.072271754381138,4.213208095012239,4.246178114249808,4.4637506205145625,4.449957298382227,4.573751515728891,4.715065048795469,5.039114765418124,5.2288713006995975,5.390512652256013,5.583416318380505,5.878215858601149,6.032366538428407,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.444321368664353E-5,7.394122569335183E-5,7.451604821652508E-5,7.408549369608395E-5,7.40867075034872E-5,7.398314909175037E-5,7.420318534314772E-5,7.395187274670524E-5,7.41181435152949E-5,8.223003428018349E-5,0.6974821426220384,7.383249811950508E-5,7.521054508358586E-5,7.62834400356697E-5,7.388633600692061E-5,7.368214605314978E-5,7.552005501764343E-5,7.421013762150525E-5,7.397990095862417E-5,7.404121714311645E-5,7.475760934502308E-5,7.428366108919724E-5,7.436824430665617E-5,7.444836774882024E-5,7.501972072367462E-5,7.462738870395749E-5,7.776458235387096E-5,7.385444784422851E-5,7.385642362366642E-5,7.404353845525774E-5,7.561731653134429E-5,7.420583777772996E-5,0.15013598157273825,7.44145678490962E-5,7.393483508938522E-5,7.427609309166783E-5,7.386075053700764E-5,7.390439680629338E-5,7.368177586809055E-5,7.37008923201185E-5,7.386678407164036E-5,7.464592212440082E-5,7.426661482550897E-5,7.397298539090619E-5,7.48718347288178E-5,7.400137662692272E-5,7.64600748957347E-5,7.533570720755957E-5,7.371921102093636E-5,7.38821349855318E-5,7.385650987759677E-5,7.593510969528966E-5,7.388323421085036E-5,7.369434936502671E-5,0.061541497105432705,7.390226457064615E-5,7.947376347676937E-5,7.384135950196692E-5,7.371835850055228E-5,7.407034202605461E-5,7.480505756730377E-5,7.40654418516105E-5,7.370472043942312E-5,7.387633059254978E-5,7.368266706221255E-5,7.538753125660716E-5,7.431740865079185E-5,7.415910168933949E-5,7.409424

{"value":"Despite some moments in heavy rain, an encounter with a drunk as well as an organ grinder with a gypsy and a monkey, and a stay in a sanitarium, this Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle silent comedy short with support from Buster Keaton and Al St. John is only fitfully amusing though there is a quite funny sequence of Arbuckle in drag flirting with Buster that's the ultimate in \"meet cute\" scenes especially since it's one of the few times we see The Great Stone Face smile and laugh in the movies! Also, many scenes seem to have been jump cut edited possibly because of overuse of the film stock. Still, if you're an Arbuckle or Keaton completist, Good Night, Nurse! is certainly worth a

{"value":"My wife and I like to rent really stupid horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is awful, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film wasn't serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be sad. If you like to watch really stupid horror movies just to make fun of them then I recommend this one.","finished_norm":["my","wife","and","i","like","to","rend","realli","stupid","horrorscifi","movi","and","watch","them","with","our","friend","for","a","laugh","we","see","thi","on","on","fullmoondirectcom","and","decid","to","add","it","to","our","netflix","list","now","when","i","sai","thi","movi","be","aw","i","mean","it","in","a","good","wai","everyth","about","it","the","act","camerawork","stori","costum","be","just","so","cheezi","and","low","budget","but","that","what","make","it","so","good","i","think","in","on","scene","the","actor","look","like","thei","be","actual","walk","in","place","i","realli","hope","that","whoever","make","thi","film","be","not","seriou","when","thei","make","it","becaus","if","thei","be","then","that","would","just","be","sad","if","you","like","to","watch","realli","stupid","horror","movi","just","to","make","fun","of","them","then","i","recommend","thi","on"],"filtered":["wife","like","rend","realli","stupid","horrorscifi","movi","watch","friend","laugh","see","thi","fullmoondirectcom","decid","add","netflix","list","sai","thi","movi","aw","mean","good","wai","everyth","act","camerawork","stori","costum","cheezi","low","budget","make","good","think","scene","actor","look","like","thei","actual","walk","place","realli","hope","whoever","make","thi","film","seriou","thei","make","becaus","thei","sad","like","watch","realli","stupid","horror","movi","make","fun","recommend","thi"],"filtered2":["wife","like","rend","realli","stupid","horrorscifi","watch","friend","laugh","see","fullmoondirectcom","decid","add","netflix","list","aw","mean","good","wai","everyth","act","camerawork","stori","costum","cheezi","low","budget","make","good","think","scene","actor","look","like","actual","walk","place","realli","hope","whoever","make","seriou","make","becaus","sad","like","watch","realli","stupid","horror","make","fun","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,12,13,16,17,19,21,22,33,41,52,83,88,133,136,138,161,164,181,193,217,249,256,259,263,294,298,299,455,493,531,602,776,1609,2398,4257,8088],"values":[4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,12,13,16,17,19,21,22,33,41,52,83,88,133,136,138,161,164,181,193,217,249,256,259,263,294,298,299,455,493,531,602,776,1609,2398,4257,8088],"values":[2.479906862482093,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.9218995441445863,1.066728610262888,3.3953824709201923,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.4018535447685214,1.5687599167621034,1.7122153074726136,2.292318797740072,2.0317223413467334,2.3212364753796515,4.693651971159972,2.2907365189289424,2.4323182980210873,2.3930275298746078,2.4442286541160034,2.517840471459249,2.6113665294700725,2.6754694156628323,2.748952192422636,2.7464553122240485,2.902686292364678,2.886778509330039,2.7819920465008363,2.7949961309240425,3.2787058260741455,3.342254038012865,3.424750734647968,3.555828138310924,3.770603439954617,4.621379564718146,5.143104478942172,5.9370563586240825,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1202914893849216E-4,1.112737101969229E-4,1.1213875718875271E-4,1.1149081825506191E-4,1.1149264490659438E-4,1.1133680046950258E-4,1.1166793171382828E-4,1.1128973288410706E-4,1.1153995277355E-4,1.2374748887613945E-4,0.7838693234411733,1.1111008671855628E-4,1.1318390138799124E-4,1.1479849461187192E-4,1.1119110703470217E-4,1.108838227893037E-4,1.136496810445014E-4,1.1167839415612496E-4,1.1133191237330487E-4,1.1142418673418539E-4,1.1250228109243809E-4,1.1178903918479355E-4,1.1191632796502126E-4,1.1203690525596745E-4,1.1289673094519472E-4,1.1230631282521349E-4,1.1702745686574951E-4,1.1114311872857335E-4,1.1114609206728291E-4,1.1142768006300247E-4,1.1379604931723936E-4,1.1167192334683479E-4,1.1987034979200976E-4,1.119860399881644E-4,1.112640930150721E-4,1.1177765015038193E-4,1.1115260361340163E-4,1.112182866241191E-4,1.1088326570001268E-4,1.1091203393482358E-4,1.1116168344373836E-4,1.1233420365926487E-4,1.1176338636408625E-4,1.11321505176631E-4,1.126741781922538E-4,1.1136423097863132E-4,1.1506431136085386E-4,1.1337225712296972E-4,1.1093960163858933E-4,1.1118478494263288E-4,1.1114622187030903E-4,1.142742943570778E-4,1.1118643916026846E-4,1.1090218748067179E-4,1.1211949770152995E-4,1.1121507783539188E-4,1.1959959335875532E-4,1.1112342216025009E-4,1.1093831868574041E-4,1.114680165970689E-4,1.1257368563957555E-4,1.1146064235373043E-4,1.1091779484876715E-4,1.1117604994620167E-4,1.1088460685273945E-4,1.134502468257489E-4,1.1183982568925731E-4,1.1160159048574772E-4,1.115039898509808E-4,1.1191043961855292E-4,1.1088056160642415E-4,1.1150632747989452E-4,1.1331488608874458E-4,1.1107926573178487E-4,1.1382841968267785E-4,1.1137294802530411E-4,1.1224460856242051E-4,1.115586188929772E-4,1.1084579728467101E-4,0.207375590227

The entire team finds it amusing to cause stumbling blocks in the writer's determination to Quarterback for a series in a real game.<br /><br />This movie is Alda's debut and also helped Karras leave the gridiron for acting. Besides the 1968 Detroit Lions, the cast also includes \"Sugar Ray\" Robinson, Roy Schieder and Lauren Hutton.<br /><br />Alex March directs this story based on Plimton's book.","finished_norm":["bestsel","writer","georg","plimptonalan","aldatak","on","a","assign","for","sport","illustr","he","be","to","go","incognito","to","the","detroit","lion","train","camp","and","try","out","for","a","posit","a","string","quarterback","he","be","quickli","find","out","by","the","team","member","featur","alex","karra","and","mike","lucci","the","entir","team","find","it","amus","to","caus","stumbl","block","in","the","writer","determin","to","quarterback","for","a","seri","in","a","real","gamebr","br","thi","movi","be","alda","debut","and","conjur","help","karra","leav","the","gridiron","for","act","besid","the","detroit","lion","the","cast","conjur","includ","sugar","rai","robinson","roi","schieder","and","lauren","huttonbr","br","alex","march","direct","thi","stori","base","on","plimton","book"],"filtered":["bestsel","writer","georg","plimptonalan","aldatak","assign","sport","illustr","go","incognito","detroit","lion","train","camp","try","posit","string","quarterback","quickli","find","team","member","featur","alex","karra","mike","lucci","entir","team","find","amus","caus","stumbl","block","writer","determin","quarterback","seri","real","gamebr","br","thi","movi","alda","debut","conjur","help","karra","leav","gridiron","act","besid","detroit","lion","cast","conjur","includ","sugar","rai","robinson","roi","schieder","lauren","huttonbr","br","alex","march","direct","thi","stori","base","plimton","book"],"filtered2":["bestsel","writer","georg","plimptonalan","aldatak","assign","sport","illustr","go","incognito","detroit","lion","train","camp","try","posit","string","quarterback","quickli","find","team","member","featur","alex","karra","mike","lucci","entir","team","find","amus","caus","stumbl","block","writer","determin","quarterback","real","gamebr","alda","debut","conjur","help","karra","leav","gridiron","act","besid","detroit","lion","cast","conjur","includ","sugar","rai","robinson","roi","schieder","lauren","huttonbr","alex","march","direct","stori","base","plimton","book"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,17,21,36,38,39,74,80,92,102,151,185,198,287,301,305,334,453,509,618,680,708,713,723,771,908,972,1327,1462,1619,1676,1729,1779,2102,2206,2255,2342,2402,2547,2817,2996,4142,4854,5902,7080,7670,7899],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,17,21,36,38,39,74,80,92,102,151,185,198,287,301,305,334,453,509,618,680,708,713,723,771,908,972,1327,1462,1619,1676,1729,1779,2102,2206,2255,2342,2402,2547,2817,2996,4142,4854,5902,7080,7670,7899],"values":[0.9708269144703846,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.4680183469605717,3.038623282696244,3.1077880109725475,1.9486336368009016,1.9951803900462557,2.0489535369135887,2.087553710177271,2.8002454868101863,2.518833027372001,2.5439726117360975,5.68378037616381,2.8309760279012264,2.8612813773965557,2.942840385588056,3.2872346624216657,3.360519385990158,3.5642670069567886,3.8095464139032247,3.6683728173057184,3.865219416329466,7.730438832658932,3.7264536553416874,4.081705786614497,3.9911462095687695,4.613282354485526,4.724033718778229,10.313795602149016,4.770124825978496,4.6973654716960676,4.715065048795469,4.933754249760298,5.039114765418124,5.051537285416681,5.501738287366237,5.143104478942172,10.926544013076883,5.3560264761848435,5.482320201509136,5.9370563586240825,6.1754673820690815,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304,14.071337294584385]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.865735927758053E-5,5.8261818991000645E-5,5.871474907814797E-5,5.837549463246526E-5,5.837645104922135E-5,5.8294852436498465E-5,5.846822949550932E-5,5.827020831224122E-5,5.84012209825375E-5,6.47929666830852E-5,0.43627206270373164,5.81761473488634E-5,5.926197628974869E-5,6.010736140351327E-5,5.8218568788622454E-5,5.805767778343796E-5,5.95058539315498E-5,5.847370752727634E-5,0.13364054306060924,5.834060702422848E-5,5.890508661464187E-5,5.8531640174809484E-5,5.859828732677456E-5,5.86614204090372E-5,0.03969408771980978,5.8802479559544904E-5,6.127442409193598E-5,5.819344258405524E-5,5.819499939492627E-5,5.834243609679968E-5,5.9582490917925045E-5,5.84703194752475E-5,6.27629348352863E-5,5.863478785566565E-5,5.825678352928014E-5,0.064199528245764,5.819840877635742E-5,5.823279975401452E-5,5.8057386096970615E-5,5.8072448861448196E-5,5.820316288611624E-5,5.881708292562422E-5,0.09730688673013455,5.828684397175759E-5,5.899509024350279E-5,5.8309214780980924E-5,6.024654043588807E-5,5.936059749791918E-5,5.80868830396917E-5,5.8215258603466106E-5,5.819506735851262E-5,5.983289531169515E-5,5.821612473553168E-5,5.8067293355008455E-5,5.8704665000278665E-5,5.823111966383262E-5,6.262116943286552E-5,5.818312965482548E-5,5.808621129821273E-5,5.8363555908859E-5,5.894247333243078E-5,5.8359694827658234E-5,5.8075465219263614E-5,5.821068504534477E-5,5.8058088311332

{"value":"The worst movie I have seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya. There is no story, no humor, no nothing! The action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up advertisements stitched together. Heavily influenced from The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle but very poorly executed.<br /><br />I did not go a lot of expectations, but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder \"What were these guys thinking??!!\".<br /><br />The only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini.<br /><br />The reason why I did not give a rating of '1' is that every time I think I have seen the worst, Bollywood proves me

{"value":"There are a lot of pretentious people out there who will pretend that this is endowed with some kind of beautiful meaning, and that ignorant fools like me don't 'get' it. Obviously this means that we should stick to Hollywood dross.<br /><br />It has every, a-hem, artistic cliché in the book - I guess it is good that the director is one of the chosen few. Almost a self parody drowning in its own pretense.<br /><br />The director of the (almost equally embarrassing) movie 'Ratcatcher' returns with another piece wallowing in artistic nonsense; it is difficult to understand and apparently is a study of alienation. The best way to describe this film is alienating for its viewers.","finished_norm":["there","be","a","lot","of","pretenti","peopl","out","there","who","will","pretend","that","thi","be","endow","with","some","kind","of","beauti","mean","and","that","ignor","fool","like","me","do","not","get","it","obvious","thi","mean","that","we","should","stick","to","hollywood","drossbr","br","it","have","everi","ahem","artist","cliché","in","the","book","i","guess","it","be","good","that","the","director","be","on","of","the","choos","few","almost","a","self","parodi","drown","in","it","own","pretensebr","br","the","director","of","the","almost","equal","embarrass","movi","ratcatch","return","with","anoth","piec","wallow","in","artist","nonsens","it","be","difficult","to","understand","and","appar","be","a","studi","of","alien","the","well","wai","to","describ","thi","film","be","alien","for","it","viewer"],"filtered":["lot","pretenti","peopl","pretend","thi","endow","kind","beauti","mean","ignor","fool","like","get","obvious","thi","mean","stick","hollywood","drossbr","br","everi","ahem","artist","cliché","book","guess","good","director","choos","almost","self","parodi","drown","pretensebr","br","director","almost","equal","embarrass","movi","ratcatch","return","anoth","piec","wallow","artist","nonsens","difficult","understand","appar","studi","alien","well","wai","describ","thi","film","alien","viewer"],"filtered2":["lot","pretenti","peopl","pretend","endow","kind","beauti","mean","ignor","fool","like","get","obvious","mean","stick","hollywood","drossbr","everi","ahem","artist","cliché","book","guess","good","director","choos","almost","self","parodi","drown","pretensebr","director","almost","equal","embarrass","ratcatch","return","anoth","piec","wallow","artist","nonsens","difficult","understand","appar","studi","alien","well","wai","describ","alien","viewer"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,20,23,33,58,72,73,85,88,122,131,151,212,218,243,279,300,308,325,341,416,488,523,557,565,584,668,724,763,803,905,906,1047,1057,1109,1171,1294,1368,2357,6504,6543],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,20,23,33,58,72,73,85,88,122,131,151,212,218,243,279,300,308,325,341,416,488,523,557,565,584,668,724,763,803,905,906,1047,1057,1109,1171,1294,1368,2357,6504,6543],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.4018535447685214,3.731402629253362,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,2.011190219103739,4.063444682693467,2.2489347673732487,4.502423616410601,2.8002454868101863,2.5983793339432615,2.5940874818617203,2.627841366673578,2.7910771187233068,2.932274249550174,2.8753661172782943,2.973659465713028,2.933776879434709,3.1401446412440817,3.3933092088131493,3.4986697244709752,3.43462735814388,7.816221961917559,3.5146700658174166,3.5813614403160887,7.597548633842627,3.7465885637507435,3.7636829971100436,3.9121030022283168,3.9081109809587793,4.140259095366071,4.181290492043933,4.165705761027235,4.297765483040301,4.605250182788262,4.436351646326448,5.143104478942172,6.489124940924123,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.359263826933145E-5,8.302895356711784E-5,8.367442450891447E-5,8.319095279268846E-5,8.319231578278741E-5,8.307602955032433E-5,8.332310930223595E-5,8.304090919390407E-5,8.32276154297738E-5,9.233649610281928E-5,0.8060274757366648,8.290686285796696E-5,8.44542783399402E-5,8.565903717810717E-5,8.29673176774869E-5,8.273803180845328E-5,8.480182851512938E-5,8.333091604862835E-5,8.307238220620762E-5,8.314123444103852E-5,8.394567464757E-5,8.341347589975131E-5,8.350845479642365E-5,8.359842579023253E-5,8.424000075974084E-5,8.379944927114258E-5,8.732221892294646E-5,8.293151030812461E-5,8.293372892024079E-5,8.314384105346868E-5,8.49110439308763E-5,8.332608773362795E-5,0.070883745139,8.356047172227594E-5,8.302177752756705E-5,8.340497775937599E-5,8.293858763178537E-5,8.29875982348951E-5,8.273761612589183E-5,8.27590820806811E-5,8.2945362716485E-5,8.382026053699596E-5,8.339433456928248E-5,8.306461668236673E-5,8.407393887362719E-5,8.309649733615391E-5,8.585738130152612E-5,8.459482348349614E-5,8.27796522368471E-5,8.29626003306137E-5,8.293382577518891E-5,8.526789538425354E-5,8.296383465594544E-5,8.275173496532815E-5,0.062120755828024725,8.298520393735826E-5,8.92414665248115E-5,8.291681334642675E-5,8.277869493765815E-5,8.317393891043896E-5,8.399895448175782E-5,8.316843648127884E-5,8.276338069403262E-5,8.295608255016211E-5,8.273861685200477E-5,8.46530169543466E-5,8.345137119697376E-5,8.327360755796824E-5,8.320078102456837E-5,8.35040610969178E-5,8.273559841604279E-5,8.320252528996755E-5,8.455201501662336E-5,0.05460842762407044,8.493519768259525E-5,8.310300172305857E-5,8.375340748498065E-5,8.324154350281511E-5,8.270965836918424E-5,8.281218267128032E-5]}}

{"value":"In sixth grade, every teacher I had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester. Every class had something to do with this terrible show. We watched it in English and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters. In math we talked about charts and other sea crap. In science we talked about whales (which was actually somewhat interesting, so this wasn't a 100% waste of time). All day everyday was torture. Not only that, but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well. I could see if this was a new series or something, but it was, like, '93.

{"value":"The first ten minutes of this movie about making an international movie in Belgium, are fine: you see real chaos on the set, a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown, the cool has been-director (Mickey Rourke), the bad tempered star, etc. You have seen everything before, but it's well done. BUT THEN! The rest of the time the film just repeats itself: the same ten minutes over and over again. No climax, no dramatic development, no good acting, not even bad acting, it just goes on and on and on. Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f**ked up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet. Altogether, that makes 12 good minutes.<br /><br />","finished_norm":["the","ten","minut","of","thi","movi","about","make","a","intern","movi","in","belgium","be","fine","you","see","real","chao","on","the","set","a","produc","on","the","edg","of","a","nervou","breakdown","the","cool","have","beendirector","mickei","rourk","the","bad","temper","star","etc","you","have","see","everyth","befor","but","it","good","do","but","then","the","rest","of","the","time","the","film","just","repeat","itself","the","same","ten","minut","over","and","over","again","no","climax","no","dramat","develop","no","good","act","not","even","bad","act","it","just","go","on","and","on","and","on","mickei","rourk","have","two","good","minut","when","hi","charact","talk","about","hi","fked","up","career","in","a","scene","where","realiti","and","fiction","meet","altogeth","that","make","good","minutesbr","br"],"filtered":["ten","minut","thi","movi","make","intern","movi","belgium","fine","see","real","chao","set","produc","edg","nervou","breakdown","cool","beendirector","mickei","rourk","bad","temper","star","etc","see","everyth","befor","good","rest","time","film","repeat","ten","minut","climax","dramat","develop","good","act","even","bad","act","go","mickei","rourk","two","good","minut","hi","charact","talk","hi","fked","career","scene","realiti","fiction","meet","altogeth","make","good","minutesbr","br"],"filtered2":["ten","minut","make","intern","belgium","fine","see","real","chao","set","produc","edg","nervou","breakdown","cool","beendirector","mickei","rourk","bad","temper","star","etc","see","everyth","befor","good","rest","time","repeat","ten","minut","climax","dramat","develop","good","act","even","bad","act","go","mickei","rourk","two","good","minut","charact","talk","fked","career","scene","realiti","fiction","meet","altogeth","make","good","minutesbr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,8,9,10,19,21,47,59,79,80,100,109,186,193,226,261,320,350,429,464,481,511,545,656,756,916,988,1137,1382,1552,2810,3092,3164,3576,3720,4660,5013,5643,7727],"values":[2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,8,9,10,19,21,47,59,79,80,100,109,186,193,226,261,320,350,429,464,481,511,545,656,756,916,988,1137,1382,1552,2810,3092,3164,3576,3720,4660,5013,5643,7727],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.3114004109387893,2.714457859969082,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.312380678011735,2.324031090670098,1.7064694353107215,5.607976334760217,1.9469506069506084,1.9951803900462557,2.1405462403177813,2.125691139326857,2.571852579609833,2.517840471459249,2.5940874818617203,2.7085302779237206,2.938298364153555,3.0135689919434205,3.2872346624216657,3.2872346624216657,3.353630724994973,3.3909310864081816,6.884198745965162,3.68099128126493,3.7636829971100436,4.100845126825194,4.039936373738201,4.181290492043933,4.449957298382227,4.597282013139085,5.3064295350454715,5.426230734858092,11.591955520728355,5.7446844659766265,5.7959777603641776,13.451027437976705,6.255510089742618,6.342521466732247,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.54825309653201E-5,7.497353461264574E-5,7.55563823533092E-5,7.511981677114269E-5,7.512104752476501E-5,7.501604331237906E-5,0.07186887823679529,7.498433031173822E-5,7.515292242130949E-5,0.14117462106640402,0.33327518703165987,7.486328907039635E-5,7.626057523640929E-5,7.734844909935261E-5,7.491787859982016E-5,7.471083790739127E-5,7.657440630340104E-5,7.524620087648043E-5,7.501274983138683E-5,7.507492206395723E-5,7.580131596725311E-5,7.532075082068486E-5,7.540651492213628E-5,7.548775698443701E-5,7.606708673769175E-5,7.566927728857742E-5,7.885026995529092E-5,7.488554523981819E-5,7.488754860352614E-5,7.50772757844229E-5,7.667302570544033E-5,7.524184100168673E-5,0.12260116346068473,7.54534851972425E-5,7.496705478812033E-5,7.531307716475884E-5,7.489193592580963E-5,7.493619154979102E-5,7.4710462554101E-5,7.472984589491459E-5,7.48980536958815E-5,7.568806945798046E-5,7.530346657054341E-5,7.500573771398131E-5,7.591713607552522E-5,7.503452532598288E-5,0.325423317503463,7.638748477497782E-5,7.474842034694656E-5,7.491361892709295E-5,7.488763606166565E-5,7.699525564622507E-5,7.491473349892612E-5,7.472321159225806E-5,7.554340577663748E-5,7.493402954555589E-5,8.058331331338101E-5,7.487227416847241E-5,7.474755592434706E-5,7.510445356547857E-5,7.584942662409053E-5,7.509948497867401E-5,7.47337274593936E-5,7.49077334977663E-5,7.471136619037056E-5,7.644003235041498E-5,7.535496953904637E-5,7.519445242098975E-5,7.512869147389845E-5,7.54025474967042E-5,7.470864060124352E-5,7.513026651172153E-5,7.634882955971962E-5,7.484252263496059E-5,7.669483607474798E-5,7.504039866119643E-5,7.562770244871569E-5,7.516549920111204E-5,7.468521724207242E-5,7.477779469826815E-5]}}
{"value":"Sorry, but aside from Kim Basinger doing a good job acting scared, this was one of the worst thrillers I've seen in awhile. Logic is thrown out as 4 young guys terrorize this woman outside a crowded mall then shoot a security guard. Yet no one seems to notice. Then, instead of screaming for help or racing back to the mall, she drives off and ends up in the middle of the woods with the guys in hot pursuit. I can't even describe how silly it is seeing this woman fleeing from 4 retarded thugs, carrying a red toolbox, screaming for God to come help her, and then having sex with one of them after brutally killing the others. Please trust me, this is bad and a bit tasteless as

{"value":"Another American Pie movie has been shoved down our throats and this one is the worst one of them all. It doesn't deserve the name American Pie. They should have stopped at \"The Wedding\".<br /><br />This movie feels like just a stupid porn movie which they slapped the title American Pie on. When i was watching this i felt like i was watching a different series. It doesn't fell like American Pie at all. It has different humor and it is much more rude and has many more sex scenes then the other American Pie movies.<br /><br />I don't recommend it ever. Actually i don't recommend any of the \"American Pie Presents\" movies. Just stick with the nice original trilogy.<br /><br />2/10","finished_norm":["anoth","american","pie","movi","have","be","shove","down","our","throat","and","thi","on","be","the","wrong","on","of","them","all","it","doe","not","deserv","the","name","american","pie","thei","should","have","stop","at","the","weddingbr","br","thi","movi","feel","like","just","a","stupid","porn","movi","which","thei","slap","the","titl","american","pie","on","when","i","be","watch","thi","i","feel","like","i","be","watch","a","differ","seri","it","doe","not","fall","like","american","pie","at","all","it","have","differ","humor","and","it","be","much","much","rude","and","have","mani","much","sex","scene","then","the","other","american","pie","moviesbr","br","i","do","not","recommend","it","ever","actual","i","do","not","recommend","ani","of","the","american","pie","present","movi","just","stick","with","the","nice","origin","trilogybr","br"],"filtered":["anoth","american","pie","movi","shove","throat","thi","wrong","doe","deserv","name","american","pie","thei","stop","weddingbr","br","thi","movi","feel","like","stupid","porn","movi","thei","slap","titl","american","pie","watch","thi","feel","like","watch","differ","seri","doe","fall","like","american","pie","differ","humor","much","much","rude","mani","much","sex","scene","american","pie","moviesbr","br","recommend","ever","actual","recommend","ani","american","pie","present","movi","stick","nice","origin","trilogybr","br"],"filtered2":["anoth","american","pie","shove","throat","wrong","doe","deserv","name","american","pie","stop","weddingbr","feel","like","stupid","porn","slap","titl","american","pie","watch","feel","like","watch","differ","doe","fall","like","american","pie","differ","humor","rude","mani","sex","scene","american","pie","moviesbr","recommend","ever","actual","recommend","ani","american","pie","present","stick","nice","origin","trilogybr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,18,19,25,27,43,44,50,52,69,73,136,143,170,204,223,254,262,264,298,315,369,411,416,423,971,1491,1933,2092,2531,2859,3318],"values":[3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,18,19,25,27,43,44,50,52,69,73,136,143,170,204,223,254,262,264,298,315,369,411,416,423,971,1491,1933,2092,2531,2859,3318],"values":[1.9381148836729736,1.9218995441445863,2.430631986809635,1.312380678011735,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,3.321622407243643,1.604729392502474,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,2.127032521151058,1.8950689206770979,2.346825985579986,2.3409902041158843,2.4071371113909277,5.249049228095168,16.953379768766858,2.889652074525771,2.726701583487816,2.757740698455715,5.563984093001673,2.854312708080462,3.121829110937649,3.229006157521873,3.1401446412440817,3.164467636384302,4.181290492043933,4.558366596889411,4.869215728622727,31.555059901169557,5.156897801074508,5.390512652256013,5.5623629091826725]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.608572857917289E-5,8.550523238616308E-5,8.616995403452424E-5,8.56720631221135E-5,8.567346676241177E-5,8.555371237670789E-5,8.580816110450065E-5,8.551754458091877E-5,8.570981919597919E-5,9.509036568325946E-5,0.44901625052875294,8.537950040942922E-5,8.697306644512678E-5,8.821375634908273E-5,8.544175825045739E-5,8.520563409530066E-5,8.733098205430497E-5,8.581620068148897E-5,8.554995625317635E-5,8.562086195638703E-5,8.644929401346026E-5,8.590122282078799E-5,8.599903439473714E-5,8.609168870872201E-5,8.675239819022363E-5,8.629870757035794E-5,0.5442607879177979,8.54048829520594E-5,8.540716773268614E-5,8.562354630915803E-5,8.744345474127004E-5,8.581122836546659E-5,9.211108443348988E-5,8.605260268798822E-5,8.549784232639427E-5,8.589247122948852E-5,8.541217135180776E-5,8.546264366090287E-5,8.52052060153058E-5,8.522731217675663E-5,8.541914849853536E-5,8.632013951724627E-5,8.588151061390592E-5,8.55419591281725E-5,8.658138362780169E-5,8.557479059952774E-5,8.841801594331762E-5,8.711780324649792E-5,8.524849582303455E-5,8.543690021210678E-5,8.540726747626342E-5,8.781094903256803E-5,8.543817135030373E-5,8.52197459389729E-5,8.615515460950546E-5,8.546017795516418E-5,9.19030290742815E-5,8.538974766405013E-5,8.524750997308587E-5,8.565454181306366E-5,8.650416288037962E-5,8.564887527791162E-5,8.523173899315944E-5,8.543018804354134E-5,8.520623658735527E-5,8.717773229575907E-5,8.594024831799276E-5,8.575718300631579E-5,8.568218447393997E-5,8.599450965630382E-5,8.520312812871181E-5,8.568398076080006E-5,8.707371804789195E-5,8.5355816867004E-5,8.746832886126069E-5,8.558148897509336E-5,8.625129262104069E-5,8.572416266378077E-5,8.517641443861387E-5,8.528199645427624E-5]}}
{"value":"As I sat subjected to this televised mediocrity, I wondered why? Why did Dianne Keaton agree to this trash? The movie uses meaningless, contrived plot lines to deliver trash to homes of thousands. The movie takes a political agenda to a new level. The movie was meaningless, and all creditability was lost to the excessive use of stereotype. <br /><br />It was obvious that Keaton tried to make this movie worthwhile, but in the end she needs to remember the age old adage that you cannot polish a turd.

{"value":"I'm a big Porsche fan, and the car was the best star in this film.<br /><br />Haim, the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80's is bland as per usual, and commenting on back up from minor characters/actors would be pointless; needless to say they were all very average. It's a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80's - with some weird clothes, some good shots of the Colorado backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plot.<br /><br />All in all, please don't waste your time watching this unless you love 80's movies, Corey Haim, or like myself, love old school Porsches (this one in particular looks great) because life's too short to watch

{"value":"supposedly based on the life of Domino Harvey a model turned bounty hunter. I'd say 95 % is fabricated. I always keep an open mind when it comes to movies, however, this movie lost its chances when it became apparent it had narration throughout the film, something i can't stand, and to top it off, the heroine of the story is so hateful and depicted as an arrogant b!ch I just wanted it to end with her being shot in the head. it's too incoherent, too flashy and way too boring, it's a who gives a crap kinda story, and i really think that big time directors need to make movies based on their own or a writer's own imagination not something based on some ignorant snobby brat's life.","finished_norm":["supposedli","base","on","the","life","of","domino","harvei","a","model","turn","bounti","hunter","i","have","sai","be","fabric","i","alwai","keep","a","open","mind","when","it","come","to","movi","howev","thi","movi","lose","it","chanc","when","it","becom","appar","it","have","narrat","throughout","the","film","someth","i","ca","not","stand","and","to","top","it","off","the","heroin","of","the","stori","be","so","hate","and","depict","a","a","arrog","bch","i","just","want","it","to","end","with","her","be","shoot","in","the","head","it","too","incoher","too","flashi","and","wai","too","bore","it","a","who","give","a","crap","kinda","stori","and","i","realli","think","that","big","time","director","ne","to","make","movi","base","on","their","own","or","a","writer","own","imagin","not","someth","base","on","some","ignor","snobbi","brat","life"],"filtered":["supposedli","base","life","domino","harvei","model","turn","bounti","hunter","sai","fabric","alwai","keep","open","mind","come","movi","howev","thi","movi","lose","chanc","becom","appar","narrat","throughout","film","someth","ca","stand","top","heroin","stori","hate","depict","arrog","bch","want","end","shoot","head","incoher","flashi","wai","bore","give","crap","kinda","stori","realli","think","big","time","director","ne","make","movi","base","writer","imagin","someth","base","ignor","snobbi","brat","life"],"filtered2":["supposedli","base","life","domino","harvei","model","turn","bounti","hunter","fabric","alwai","keep","open","mind","come","howev","lose","chanc","becom","appar","narrat","throughout","someth","ca","stand","top","heroin","stori","hate","depict","arrog","bch","want","end","shoot","head","incoher","flashi","wai","bore","give","crap","kinda","stori","realli","think","big","time","director","ne","make","base","writer","imagin","someth","base","ignor","snobbi","brat","life"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,8,12,13,17,24,30,33,34,37,53,58,75,81,82,96,108,110,113,115,117,134,197,208,221,238,242,287,308,313,334,339,340,364,377,438,486,763,946,1011,1102,1214,1260,1308,1397,1537,2364,3113,3592,3608,3814,4517,4654],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,8,12,13,17,24,30,33,34,37,53,58,75,81,82,96,108,110,113,115,117,134,197,208,221,238,242,287,308,313,334,339,340,364,377,438,486,763,946,1011,1102,1214,1260,1308,1397,1537,2364,3113,3592,3608,3814,4517,4654],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.5541073880211935,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,3.400636547121535,1.865701314626681,3.948450049740535,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,2.0390708128715254,2.138507503627933,2.1290479736304078,2.1521782565202803,2.201553588425805,2.2797301185117202,2.2443961816702407,2.558331832813986,2.6289494000279396,2.6423424573643777,2.597304642813496,2.689504733779216,2.841890188081905,2.8753661172782943,2.907069060519773,8.828521156764168,3.003844442051426,2.948928684455311,2.9878441007049847,3.0602441305135506,3.1797351085150902,3.3066947359763783,3.7465885637507435,3.9612932464190886,4.086456389373095,4.390138803171316,4.456830177669989,4.589376833631972,4.506310234933358,4.422928625994308,4.550761997504193,5.129498826886393,5.521540914662417,5.695894301807195,6.389041482367141,5.7959777603641776,6.032366538428407,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.211357172262011E-5,7.162729304971765E-5,7.218412695303515E-5,7.176704629849725E-5,0.10181022031170793,7.16679044882565E-5,7.188105487780728E-5,7.163760691189007E-5,7.179867436723311E-5,7.965670987524085E-5,0.7187800897631395,7.152196801998657E-5,7.285689008554495E-5,7.389620963189893E-5,7.157412109295674E-5,7.13763211035813E-5,7.315671414905832E-5,7.188778959006838E-5,7.1664758002908E-5,7.17241553455154E-5,7.241812861554616E-5,7.19590121985256E-5,7.204094845055833E-5,7.211856449246489E-5,7.267203742425594E-5,7.229198312727134E-5,7.533100076335942E-5,7.154323084529658E-5,7.154514479426717E-5,7.172640401401453E-5,7.325093193999949E-5,7.188362430653037E-5,7.71609813075315E-5,7.208582233408325E-5,7.16211024346881E-5,7.1951681035541E-5,7.154933630025028E-5,7.159161669378367E-5,7.137596250317306E-5,7.13944807208336E-5,7.15551810201506E-5,7.230993655886325E-5,7.194249938428492E-5,7.165805885245578E-5,7.25287794055765E-5,7.1685561607017E-5,0.06546906623295817,7.297813535905135E-5,7.141222615228227E-5,7.157005153923616E-5,7.154522834894844E-5,0.05118258039696279,7.157111636516083E-5,7.138814252238779E-5,7.217172955087384E-5,7.158955118477807E-5,7.698669440404377E-5,7.153055209243693E-5,7.141140031085471E-5,7.175236878809345E-5,7.246409198293856E-5,7.174762196076389E-5,7.139818904214814E-5,7.156442879017837E-5,7.137682580807424E

with rusty utensils no less.Also,as an animal lover i almost cried when she scratched the cat to a bloody pulp.However,As creepy and sinister as the baby was I was rooting for it to live.And as

{"value":"This film is too skeletal. It's a fairly low-budget film (I hope!) which excuses it somewhat, but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much. Phillips is quite believable in his role as a torn-apart son of a well-off family who's searching for himself (though his family is...er...well, a little too white...), but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws. Every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama, and there are *way* too many sub-plots (which is an obvious sign of plot-deficiency. They needed filler...) I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone who isn't either a hard-core Phillips fan, or who has absolutely *nothing* to do.

{"value":"This was so lame that I turned the DVD off...maybe halfway through. It was so weak, I couldn't even pay full enough attention to tell you how far in I made it.Though I really wanted to believe that the depiction of the young Carlito would be somewhat different, I just couldn't buy it. I don't really blame the actors, because I think it was the script that may have fallen flat. I did find myself laughing a few times, but I don't think those lines were intended to be funny.<br /><br />It's only saving grace is that I bought it in a 2 DVD set and I would have paid the price I did for the original alone. This is one of those cases when they should have let the classic stand alone.","finished_norm":["thi","be","so","lame","that","i","turn","the","dvd","offmayb","halfwai","through","it","be","so","weak","i","can","not","even","pai","full","enough","attent","to","tell","you","how","far","in","i","make","itthough","i","realli","want","to","believ","that","the","depict","of","the","young","carlito","would","be","somewhat","differ","i","just","can","not","bui","it","i","do","not","realli","blame","the","actor","becaus","i","think","it","be","the","script","that","mai","have","fall","flat","i","do","find","myself","laugh","a","few","time","but","i","do","not","think","that","line","be","intend","to","be","funnybr","br","it","onli","save","grace","be","that","i","bui","it","in","a","dvd","set","and","i","would","have","pai","the","price","i","do","for","the","origin","alon","thi","be","on","of","that","case","when","thei","should","have","let","the","classic","stand","alon"],"filtered":["thi","lame","turn","dvd","offmayb","halfwai","weak","even","pai","full","enough","attent","tell","far","make","itthough","realli","want","believ","depict","young","carlito","somewhat","differ","bui","realli","blame","actor","becaus","think","script","mai","fall","flat","find","laugh","time","think","line","intend","funnybr","br","onli","save","grace","bui","dvd","set","pai","price","origin","alon","thi","case","thei","let","classic","stand","alon"],"filtered2":["lame","turn","dvd","offmayb","halfwai","weak","even","pai","full","enough","attent","tell","far","make","itthough","realli","want","believ","depict","young","carlito","somewhat","differ","bui","realli","blame","actor","becaus","think","script","mai","fall","flat","find","laugh","time","think","line","intend","funnybr","onli","save","grace","bui","dvd","set","pai","price","origin","alon","case","let","classic","stand","alon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,8,11,12,13,22,37,38,41,46,69,77,90,91,93,96,101,107,109,124,133,135,170,189,204,247,288,322,332,336,347,372,377,379,457,594,596,636,898,926,1011,1149,1396,1653,2413,2698],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,8,11,12,13,22,37,38,41,46,69,77,90,91,93,96,101,107,109,124,133,135,170,189,204,247,288,322,332,336,347,372,377,379,457,594,596,636,898,926,1011,1149,1396,1653,2413,2698],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,2.2635883139467947,1.2979240167361772,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,1.655771293751733,2.127032521151058,1.9463902258768238,2.0477128419653545,2.0105926690411424,2.035389827120098,2.0390708128715254,2.098582041218749,2.1439533986393955,2.125691139326857,2.2323930368088845,2.3212364753796515,2.366244071437088,2.4071371113909277,2.498193474075453,2.624524614047584,5.460751613699401,2.8015621426949333,5.770689634656382,2.9705344631698933,2.9233055795674137,6.030397968308703,3.070535816550098,3.0602441305135506,3.1272886331425473,6.648632674652395,3.490764544963862,3.485528930909917,3.530930586689197,3.892300374932137,3.9323057095458362,4.086456389373095,4.297765483040301,4.409683399244287,4.706176101378222,5.129498826886393,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.920941545261738E-5,8.860785550876156E-5,8.92966970933973E-5,8.878073982628208E-5,8.878219439874818E-5,8.865809463305117E-5,8.89217762286385E-5,8.862061446097376E-5,8.881986590832768E-5,9.854079273984938E-5,0.9229157301053968,8.847756125054646E-5,9.012895105552417E-5,9.141466034690899E-5,8.854207816522132E-5,8.829738606348227E-5,9.049985390786849E-5,8.893010752786142E-5,8.865420221568832E-5,8.872768078687637E-5,8.958617313832049E-5,8.901821476087879E-5,8.911957550301945E-5,8.921559185005137E-5,8.990027568326715E-5,8.943012255030819E-5,9.318959501006118E-5,8.85038648182587E-5,8.85062325039078E-5,8.873046254345231E-5,9.061640775278729E-5,8.892495478752775E-5,9.545340597844851E-5,8.917508756299264E-5,8.860019729499005E-5,8.900914561135782E-5,8.851141768319773E-5,8.856372141884861E-5,8.829694245027555E-5,8.831985075079734E-5,8.851864800106074E-5,8.94523321718735E-5,8.899778728140856E-5,8.864591490885278E-5,8.972305572591364E-5,8.867993769539816E-5,9.162633165762486E-5,9.027893974305588E-5,8.834180306197364E-5,8.853704384921264E-5,8.85063358667575E-5,9.099723685709945E-5,8.853836111163675E-5,8.831200996625614E-5,8.928136065985889E-5,8.856116624308071E-5,9.523780117050763E-5,8.848818033468287E-5,8.834078143970132E-5,8.876258274305703E-5,8.964303296427781E-5,8.875671059331865E-5,8.832443819763817E-5,8.853008812444822E-5,8.829801041742448E-5,9.034104336396328E-5,0.07011322957160869,8.886894835095174E-5,8.879122843914431E-5,8.911488658097191E-5,8.829478916596831E-5,8.879308990565471E-5,9.02332548791108E-5,8.845301833256839E-5,9.064218444935347E-5,8.868687912667315E-5,8.938098711308623E-5,8.8834729839

{"value":"My first clue about how bad this was going to be was when the video case said it was from the people who brought us Blair Witch Project which was a masterpiece in comparison to this piece of garbage. The acting was on the caliber of a 6th grade production of Oklahoma and the plot, such as there was, is predictable, boring and inane. 85% of the script is four letter words and innumerable variations on them. Mother F seems to be the \"writer's\" favorite because it is used constantly. It must have taken all of 10 minutes to write this script in some dive at last call.

{"value":"Why is it that a woman cannot be a strong character in a movie without sleeping with the leading man? The campaign manager in this movie dreams of leading Tom Sellick to the White House. It's all she can think about. So, why on earth must she have had an affair with him? It added nothing to the plot and served only to demean successful women. The only value of that tidbit was the cute \"we've all slept with your husband\" scene. <br /><br />Also, couldn't the people who made this movie have watched the national conventions they were spoofing? Airing between the two major political conventions only served to highlight their total ignorance of the nomination and selection

{"value":"Blue Monkey (1987) or 'Invasion of the BodySuckers' as it's known here in the UK was a pretty boring horror movie about an old man who gets bitten in a greenhouse by some mysterious toxic plant!!!! The man gets rushed to hospital, where this worm like creature comes out of his mouth, of course this transforms into this insect monster and proceeds to go on the rampage!! Despite Steve Railsback and John Vernon being in the movie, i found it to be boring, with a flat predictable storyline, un-interesting characters, cheap special effects and lack of action!!!! Horror fans don't really need to track this rare movie down, you wont be missing much trust me!!! I give this movie 2/10.","finished_norm":["blue","monkei","or","invas","of","the","bodysuck","a","it","know","here","in","the","uk","be","a","pretti","bore","horror","movi","about","a","old","man","who","get","bite","in","a","greenhous","by","some","mysteri","toxic","plant","the","man","get","rush","to","hospit","where","thi","worm","like","creatur","come","out","of","hi","mouth","of","cours","thi","transform","into","thi","insect","monster","and","proce","to","go","on","the","rampag","despit","steve","railsback","and","john","vernon","be","in","the","movi","i","find","it","to","be","bore","with","a","flat","predict","storylin","uninterest","charact","cheap","special","effect","and","lack","of","action","horror","fan","do","not","realli","ne","to","track","thi","rare","movi","down","you","wont","be","miss","much","trust","me","i","give","thi","movi"],"filtered":["blue","monkei","invas","bodysuck","know","uk","pretti","bore","horror","movi","old","man","get","bite","greenhous","mysteri","toxic","plant","man","get","rush","hospit","thi","worm","like","creatur","come","hi","mouth","cours","thi","transform","thi","insect","monster","proce","go","rampag","despit","steve","railsback","john","vernon","movi","find","bore","flat","predict","storylin","uninterest","charact","cheap","special","effect","lack","action","horror","fan","realli","ne","track","thi","rare","movi","wont","miss","much","trust","give","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["blue","monkei","invas","bodysuck","know","uk","pretti","bore","horror","old","man","get","bite","greenhous","mysteri","toxic","plant","man","get","rush","hospit","worm","like","creatur","come","mouth","cours","transform","insect","monster","proce","go","rampag","despit","steve","railsback","john","vernon","find","bore","flat","predict","storylin","uninterest","charact","cheap","special","effect","lack","action","horror","fan","realli","ne","track","rare","wont","miss","trust","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,10,13,26,30,34,38,45,67,78,83,106,108,110,129,140,154,183,199,203,255,291,337,351,391,403,413,515,594,761,867,941,1013,1041,1105,1143,1248,1290,1363,1529,1583,1838,1881,2132,3127,3266,3356,4285,4466,5854,6563],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,10,13,26,30,34,38,45,67,78,83,106,108,110,129,140,154,183,199,203,255,291,337,351,391,403,413,515,594,761,867,941,1013,1041,1105,1143,1248,1290,1363,1529,1583,1838,1881,2132,3127,3266,3356,4285,4466,5854,6563],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,3.632592212924433,1.9570915389266579,2.0064197866819473,4.584637595480144,2.159084361316692,4.277015007255866,2.1290479736304078,2.4106958340079214,2.317169775997098,2.348499626138016,2.4885128563647294,2.558331832813986,2.569760528637609,2.6754694156628323,3.016831637578237,2.973659465713028,3.0135689919434205,3.109204957709252,3.189397019426827,3.467417180966871,3.3956930001684253,3.490764544963862,3.9405024767500145,3.8844878351953436,3.9612932464190886,4.039936373738201,4.240607069200353,4.613282354485526,4.436351646326448,4.327618446189983,4.3336974922663645,4.436351646326448,4.671389985292807,4.933754249760298,4.911775343041523,4.828393734102471,5.00274712124725,5.482320201509136,5.649374286172302,5.583416318380505,6.255510089742618,6.437831646536572,6.489124940924123,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.680839121920211E-5,6.635788661868415E-5,6.687375591163836E-5,6.648735863755093E-5,6.64884479580658E-5,6.639551039475108E-5,6.659297994553699E-5,6.636744172076183E-5,6.651665992355214E-5,0.13198996029202525,0.37169212987395805,6.626031003741988E-5,6.749702586597446E-5,6.845988577148099E-5,6.630862636427826E-5,6.612537793048582E-5,6.777479276690095E-5,6.659921920509299E-5,6.63925953869501E-5,6.644762304412342E-5,6.70905427693898E-5,6.666520217855832E-5,6.67411106247783E-5,6.681301668585269E-5,6.73257722639367E-5,0.056176949620141886,6.97891235964657E-5,6.628000862005563E-5,6.628178176550588E-5,6.644970628478428E-5,6.786207923582276E-5,6.659536034904831E-5,0.10296283192287434,6.678268327045988E-5,6.63521514287483E-5,6.665841034738053E-5,6.628566491488855E-5,6.632483486590618E-5,6.612504571124064E-5,6.614220159883011E-5,6.629107965616873E-5,6.699031007980005E-5,6.664990416283715E-5,6.63863890730267E-5,6.719305331064402E-5,6.641186853191965E-5,6.861840513476163E-5,0.03877595431752444,6.615864155178565E-5,6.63048561954937E-5,6.628185917331833E-5,0.11607012517489619,6.630584268534931E-5,6.613632968274999E-5,6.68622705493978E-5,6.63229213102409E-5,0.0704269816356517,6.626826260524892E-5,6.615787646505011E-5,6.647376090783435E-5,6.713312474885844E-5,6.646936329044129E-5,6.614563710999993E-5,6.6

{"value":"Very disappointing version of Lorna Doone. Too many missing characters, no romantic scenes, changes in story line, too short, appeared low budget. Hardly enough dialogue to understand the story if you're not familiar with the novel. In some scenes it looks like Lorna has a cold sore on her upper lip. I'm sure make-up did it's best to hide it. I guess they didn't want to halt filming until it healed up, pity. Most likely why this movie lacked kissing scenes. Only one disappointing kissing scene at the very end. Lorna Doone is a great epic tale and should be told true. The 2000 version of Lorna Doone is twice as long, more romantic, much more enjoyable and more true to the
