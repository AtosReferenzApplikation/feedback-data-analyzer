{"value":"I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. It then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer gets beaten extremely bad while Anderson gets raped. They then decide to go for some revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it's not. The story gets boring and side-tracked, and certain things get really weird. I won't give out any details, but things happen that I, for one, have no desire to see. I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt, and I really wanted to like this one. It just didn't work out. I give it a 3 out of 10, mainly for the acting.","finished_norm":["i","be","realli","look","forward","to","watch","thi","be","that","i","love","danni","dyer","and","i","think","gillian","anderson","be","a","gift","actress","the","begin","be","interest","i","like","the","relationship","between","the","two","star","it","then","quickli","jump","to","the","main","plot","which","be","thei","get","attack","by","a","group","of","stranger","and","dyer","get","beat","extrem","bad","while","anderson","get","rape","thei","then","decid","to","go","for","some","reveng","sound","good","right","good","it","not","the","stori","get","bore","and","sidetrack","and","certain","thing","get","realli","weird","i","wo","not","give","out","ani","detail","but","thing","happen","that","i","for","on","have","no","desir","to","see","i","like","to","give","all","movi","the","benefit","of","the","doubt","and","i","realli","want","to","like","thi","on","it","just","do","not","work","out","i","give","it","a","out","of","mainli","for","the","act"],"filtered":["realli","look","forward","watch","thi","love","danni","dyer","think","gillian","anderson","gift","actress","begin","interest","like","relationship","two","star","quickli","jump","main","plot","thei","get","attack","group","stranger","dyer","get","beat","extrem","bad","anderson","get","rape","thei","decid","go","reveng","sound","good","right","good","stori","get","bore","sidetrack","certain","thing","get","realli","weird","wo","give","ani","detail","thing","happen","desir","see","like","give","movi","benefit","doubt","realli","want","like","thi","work","give","mainli","act"],"filtered2":["realli","look","forward","watch","love","danni","dyer","think","gillian","anderson","gift","actress","begin","interest","like","relationship","two","star","quickli","jump","main","plot","get","attack","group","stranger","dyer","get","beat","extrem","bad","anderson","get","rape","decid","go","reveng","sound","good","right","good","stori","get","bore","sidetrack","certain","thing","get","realli","weird","wo","give","ani","detail","thing","happen","desir","see","like","give","benefit","doubt","realli","want","like","work","give","mainli","act"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,9,12,13,16,17,21,27,29,30,32,37,47,48,54,60,94,100,108,121,147,178,179,249,329,354,406,410,495,567,577,625,674,678,699,741,746,771,774,871,1182,1211,1844,2079,2151,2452,3899,5136,6245],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,9,12,13,16,17,21,27,29,30,32,37,47,48,54,60,94,100,108,121,147,178,179,249,329,354,406,410,495,567,577,625,674,678,699,741,746,771,774,871,1182,1211,1844,2079,2151,2452,3899,5136,6245],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,3.983170235359962,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,3.3953824709201923,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,2.6390769554676132,4.009325967515556,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,2.08112281984698,2.1405462403177813,2.138507503627933,2.2190595059394194,2.2844323215331563,2.532833256045391,2.507968722980095,2.6754694156628323,2.951986790814132,3.0316467233633775,3.121829110937649,3.2070272508030975,3.5173618574831282,3.454678155189441,3.604618302480356,3.6194333882654965,3.6405503117064195,3.6715125373103863,3.5813614403160887,3.7165362186843414,4.00861390260916,3.7264536553416874,3.753391311073496,3.9954846111673676,4.327618446189983,4.274508620876034,10.457742601399195,5.129498826886393,5.064116067623542,5.116075806554253,5.7446844659766265,13.451027437976705,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.129577482691152E-5,7.081501074966214E-5,7.136552993264779E-5,7.09531791404145E-5,7.095434162837035E-5,7.085516163816062E-5,7.10658948165994E-5,7.082520764849095E-5,0.2564840169561352,0.06316762604904957,0.674855694574946,7.071088014811283E-5,7.20306636607588E-5,7.305819690561148E-5,7.076244178426802E-5,7.056688492629515E-5,7.232708759885134E-5,7.107255315451584E-5,7.085205083522098E-5,7.091077458808325E-5,7.159687792222844E-5,7.1142968069959E-5,7.122397513195221E-5,7.130071097673897E-5,7.184790730296653E-5,7.147216297450589E-5,7.447671692880108E-5,7.073190184443536E-5,7.073379408845515E-5,7.091299775577754E-5,7.242023692216414E-5,7.106843510696777E-5,7.62859447578811E-5,7.126834012759697E-5,7.080889033869588E-5,7.113572004531005E-5,7.073793806107527E-5,7.077973897794769E-5,7.056653039255971E-5,7.058483860618696E-5,7.074371649950211E-5,7.14899128069656E-5,7.112664251767059E-5,7.08454276558282E-5,7.170627388781405E-5,7.087261851809554E-5,7.322736369175784E-5,7.215053396411846E-5,7.060238279730866E-5,7.075841838092275E-5,7.073387669559275E-5,7.272459387743414E-5,7.0759471

{"value":"Here again is yet another Diane Lane movie where she cheats on her husband. Is this the only role she knows how to play? This time it's set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man. I am so not surprised because that is so very predictable. Then her husband gets mad and throws the milk. I wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well. I wouldn't be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie. Then after some milk throwing, she says sorry and sees the blouse man again. Duh. Then while she is making it with him, her son gets stung by wasps. My mom always told me not to throw rocks at a wasps nest. This kids mom didn't have time to tell him that, she was too busy with the blouse

{"value":"This is possibly the most boring movie in history. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie given the actor/director Roman Polanski. I think I would rather see the Three Amigos than ever watch this movie again. It promptly went from the DVD player straight into the garbage. My apologies to those of you who apparently liked this movie however you probably liked New Coke as well. I am at a loss to see why anyone would have enjoyed this movie, it is slow, dull and has no real plot. You wait for 105 minutes for the movie to get started. I understand this was made in 1976 however this was an era of bad television all around. Thank god disco and Three's Company are gone along with stop sign glasses and the Bay City Rollers.

{"value":"I was forced to watch this whole series of films as a young child and I was told they were REAL! Talk about child abuse. I would have been less frightened of Dracula or Frankenstein. This series is only good for people who believe in this ridiculousness and who want to indoctrinate their children into believing the same. Besides the obvious issues associated with brainwashing and indoctrination, there's also the bad acting, bad writing, and BAD \"special effects\". They are just all around terrible, terrible movies. Yes, believable (and horrifying) to a kid, but I can't imagine a grown-up buying into this shlock. Although, I must say, that I would be interested in seeing them today, as an adult. They might have a certain midnight/cult movie feel to them.","finished_norm":["i","be","forc","to","watch","thi","whole","seri","of","film","a","a","young","child","and","i","be","tell","thei","be","real","talk","about","child","abus","i","would","have","be","littl","frighten","of","dracula","or","frankenstein","thi","seri","be","onli","good","for","peopl","who","believ","in","thi","ridicul","and","who","want","to","indoctrin","their","child","into","believ","the","same","besid","the","obviou","issu","associ","with","brainwash","and","indoctrin","there","conjur","the","bad","act","bad","write","and","bad","special","effect","thei","be","just","all","around","terribl","terribl","movi","ye","believ","and","horrifi","to","a","kid","but","i","ca","not","imagin","a","grownup","bui","into","thi","shlock","although","i","must","sai","that","i","would","be","interest","in","see","them","todai","a","a","adult","thei","mai","have","a","certain","midnightcult","movi","feel","to","them"],"filtered":["forc","watch","thi","whole","seri","film","young","child","tell","thei","real","talk","child","abus","littl","frighten","dracula","frankenstein","thi","seri","onli","good","peopl","believ","thi","ridicul","want","indoctrin","child","believ","besid","obviou","issu","associ","brainwash","indoctrin","conjur","bad","act","bad","write","bad","special","effect","thei","around","terribl","terribl","movi","ye","believ","horrifi","kid","ca","imagin","grownup","bui","thi","shlock","although","must","sai","interest","see","todai","adult","thei","mai","certain","midnightcult","movi","feel"],"filtered2":["forc","watch","whole","young","child","tell","real","talk","child","abus","littl","frighten","dracula","frankenstein","onli","good","peopl","believ","ridicul","want","indoctrin","child","believ","besid","obviou","issu","associ","brainwash","indoctrin","conjur","bad","act","bad","write","bad","special","effect","around","terribl","terribl","ye","believ","horrifi","kid","ca","imagin","grownup","bui","shlock","although","must","interest","see","todai","adult","mai","certain","midnightcult","feel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,9,11,14,21,23,37,39,43,46,60,65,80,81,90,91,98,106,111,114,135,141,166,180,186,203,209,237,274,338,340,347,383,734,774,789,806,972,1184,1708,1742,2146,2563,3249,4932,7155],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,9,11,14,21,23,37,39,43,46,60,65,80,81,90,91,98,106,111,114,135,141,166,180,186,203,209,237,274,338,340,347,383,734,774,789,806,972,1184,1708,1742,2146,2563,3249,4932,7155],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,3.205071257016622,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,1.9951803900462557,1.949757232424728,2.0477128419653545,6.031778007123427,2.0881990796736947,2.159084361316692,2.1183455303375887,2.4433074195966826,2.366244071437088,2.2657547357741192,4.884774065938707,8.129194437808064,2.571852579609833,2.569760528637609,2.6026896854443837,2.640097787510554,2.748952192422636,2.9720957437368454,2.948928684455311,3.0151989841543516,3.0433232530252132,3.79165684915245,3.753391311073496,3.8059428063999263,3.880604335168946,3.9911462095687695,4.3773181147422555,4.688631791727313,4.724033718778229,5.626901430320244,5.259176650194926,5.822646007446338,6.1754673820690815,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.386074347554578E-5,8.329525087724877E-5,8.39427920267041E-5,8.34577696801013E-5,8.345913704169454E-5,8.334247784643259E-5,8.359035005290968E-5,8.330724484910763E-5,8.349454990462112E-5,9.263264533128353E-5,0.7463899058454866,8.317276858870248E-5,0.023961409449033397,8.593376990938862E-5,8.323341730390738E-5,8.300339605031752E-5,0.07227795713789065,8.359818183774322E-5,8.333881880425291E-5,8.340789186765195E-5,8.421491214118363E-5,8.368100648163223E-5,8.377629000245816E-5,8.38665495586614E-5,8.451018224034463E-5,8.406821777866471E-5,8.760228594793972E-5,8.31974950901958E-5,8.319972081802781E-5,8.341050684022455E-5,8.518337763650254E-5,8.359333803697258E-5,8.973036704715834E-5,8.382847376128666E-5,8.328805182211187E-5,8.367248108531997E-5,8.320459511283293E-5,8.325376290679253E-5,8.300297903454465E-5,8.302451383671517E-5,8.321139192714316E-5,8.408909579212696E-5,8.366180375950909E-5,8.333102837418326E-5,8.4343587746849E-5,8.336301127823355E-5,8.613275017844446E-5,0.15098859153806932,8.304514996718314E-5,8.322868482717008E-5,8.319981798361711E-5,8.554137361330285E-5,8.322992311133188E-5,8.301714315708767E-5,8.392837510992161E-5,8.32513609300671E-5,8.952768911905973E-5,8.318275099118983E-5,8.304418959766526E-5,8.344070122952493E-5,8.426836285885149E-5,8.343518115252002E-5,8.302882623693407E-5,8.32221461423553E-5,8.300398297026896E-5,8.492452

These are the types of movies that I think 14 year old girls watch at slumber parties. It was an all right movie. It is kind of one of those movies you have on in the back ground and look up every now and then to when something catches attention. I think That Julia stiles and Selma Blair are a good combination and would like to see them in a movie with a good story and plot. Its just kind of a boy meets girl movie. This is that perfect movie they would show on comedy Central. I am glad that I didn't see this movie in the theater, I would have been angry. But I guess that's why I didn't see it in the theater.","finished_norm":["just","a","regular","jason","lee","movi","there","be","some","part","of","the","movi","that","be","funni","the","underton","of","the","move","be","to","live","life","on","the","edg","i","guess","thi","be","the","typ","of","movi","that","i","think","year","old","girl","watch","at","slumber","parti","it","be","a","all","right","movi","it","be","kind","of","on","of","that","movi","you","have","on","in","the","back","grind","and","look","up","everi","now","and","then","to","when","someth","catch","attent","i","think","that","julia","stile","and","selma","blair","be","a","good","combin","and","would","like","to","see","them","in","a","movi","with","a","good","stori","and","plot","it","just","kind","of","a","boi","meet","girl","movi","thi","be","that","perfect","movi","thei","would","show","on","comedi","central","i","be","glad","that","i","do","not","see","thi","movi","in","the","theater","i","would","have","be","angri","but","i","guess","that","why","i","do","not","see","it","in","the","theater"],"filtered":["regular","jason","lee","movi","part","movi","funni","underton","move","live","life","edg","guess","thi","typ","movi","think","year","old","girl","watch","slumber","parti","right","movi","kind","movi","back","grind","look","everi","someth","catch","attent","think","julia","stile","selma","blair","good","combin","like","see","movi","good","stori","plot","kind","boi","meet","girl","movi","thi","perfect","movi","thei","show","comedi","central","glad","see","thi","movi","theater","angri","guess","see","theater"],"filtered2":["regular","jason","lee","part","funni","underton","move","live","life","edg","guess","typ","think","year","old","girl","watch","slumber","parti","right","kind","back","grind","look","everi","someth","catch","attent","think","julia","stile","selma","blair","good","combin","like","see","good","stori","plot","kind","boi","meet","girl","perfect","show","comedi","central","glad","see","theater","angri","guess","see","theater"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,12,16,17,28,32,53,57,61,62,63,67,75,84,85,116,121,122,127,243,275,282,350,384,424,512,570,636,677,850,968,1064,1161,1227,1263,1339,1552,1759,1854,2580,6252,6626,7119],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,12,16,17,28,32,53,57,61,62,63,67,75,84,85,116,121,122,127,243,275,282,350,384,424,512,570,636,677,850,968,1064,1161,1227,1263,1339,1552,1759,1854,2580,6252,6626,7119],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,2.133457220525776,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,1.7003182735607676,1.834162586674748,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,1.8729627573220065,1.9570915389266579,1.9742250248702675,4.442538903180445,2.011190219103739,2.2466628996789315,2.2190595059394194,4.497869534746497,2.4359679371086367,5.255682733347156,2.7832848715031413,2.918851229218033,3.0135689919434205,3.109204957709252,6.425947499981648,3.369778711402955,3.944626193933877,3.530930586689197,3.6559115968679063,3.9241755834625858,3.9911462095687695,4.105687751300982,4.327618446189983,4.246178114249808,4.390138803171316,4.506310234933358,4.597282013139085,4.751432692966343,5.0768550934009715,5.583416318380505,6.660975197850782,6.543192162194399,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.124651723195218E-5,8.069865297237194E-5,8.132600804910056E-5,8.085610550819787E-5,8.085743024445282E-5,8.074440771537304E-5,8.098455289725705E-5,8.071027305109916E-5,8.089173916730223E-5,8.974496890006807E-5,0.6039767442455417,8.057998887574504E-5,8.208397440873012E-5,8.32549203404772E-5,8.063874696303087E-5,8.041589625876835E-5,8.242177019891078E-5,8.099214053856649E-5,8.07408627380549E-5,8.080778255778379E-5,8.158964524874772E-5,8.10723832549803E-5,8.116469646251777E-5,8.125214231959572E-5,8.187571076886274E-5,8.14475238513182E-5,8.487142302647425E-5,8.06039445676028E-5,8.060610091188456E-5,8.081031601271604E-5,8.25279203616666E-5,8.098744773563546E-5,0.1998546974872017,8.121525347507424E-5,8.069167833641006E-5,8.106412362443462E-5,8.061082325824668E-5,8.065845832387619E-5,8.041549224280366E-5,8.04363557315246E-5,8.061740819260444E-5,8.146775102568165E-5,8.105377914739409E-5,8.07333151623399E-5,8.171430959561309E-5,8.076430104986435E-5,8.344769771387812E-5,8.222057499538698E-5,8.045634856321414E-5,8.063416201378225E-5,8.060619504849005E-5,8.287475637924326E-5,8.063536169639082E-5,8.04292148211946E-5,8.131204055693133E-5,8.065613122498193E-5,0.18991231889943264,8.058966009259922E-5,8.045541813169935E-5,8.083956913961345E-5,8.164142972470253E-5,8.083422114229178E-5,8.04405336994769E-5,8.062782716214057E-5,8.041646488241717E-5,8.227713520128699E-5,8.110921497823413E-5,8.093644047489637E-5,8.086565789974004E-5,8.116042607711057E-5,8.0413

{"value":"This film was so bad i had to fast forward most of it to get to the good bits. Hah what good bits? the only bit that was worth it was the ending (those who have seen the film will know what i mean). I expected a lot from this film like a underworld meets dawn of the dead meets Freddy vs. Jason but what i got was this crap. Story was forgettable, the cast was used badly and what was the director thinking when he made this. This could have been a great but i turned out to be the most boring film i have ever watched. OK so what if there was a nice bit of T and A, I was after the gore and i was bitterly disappointed. Don't expect a film thats good but if you want a bad cheesy horror then by all means watch this and see how a horror movie SHOULDN'T BE DONE.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","so","bad","i","have","to","fast","forward","much","of","it","to","get","to","the","good","bit","hah","what","good","bit","the","onli","bite","that","be","worth","it","be","the","end","that","who","have","see","the","film","will","know","what","i","mean","i","expect","a","lot","from","thi","film","like","a","underworld","meet","dawn","of","the","dead","meet","freddi","v","jason","but","what","i","get","be","thi","crap","stori","be","forgett","the","cast","be","us","badli","and","what","be","the","director","think","when","he","make","thi","thi","can","have","be","a","great","but","i","turn","out","to","be","the","much","bore","film","i","have","ever","watch","okai","so","what","if","there","be","a","nice","bite","of","t","and","a","i","be","after","the","gore","and","i","be","bitterli","disappoint","do","not","expect","a","film","that","good","but","if","you","want","a","bad","cheesi","horror","then","by","all","mean","watch","thi","and","see","how","a","horror","movi","shouldn","t","be","do"],"filtered":["thi","film","bad","fast","forward","much","get","good","bit","hah","good","bit","onli","bite","worth","end","see","film","know","mean","expect","lot","thi","film","like","underworld","meet","dawn","dead","meet","freddi","v","jason","get","thi","crap","stori","forgett","cast","us","badli","director","think","make","thi","thi","great","turn","much","bore","film","ever","watch","okai","nice","bite","gore","bitterli","disappoint","expect","film","good","want","bad","cheesi","horror","mean","watch","thi","see","horror","movi","shouldn"],"filtered2":["bad","fast","forward","get","good","bit","hah","good","bit","onli","bite","worth","end","see","know","mean","expect","lot","like","underworld","meet","dawn","dead","meet","freddi","v","jason","get","crap","stori","forgett","cast","us","badli","director","think","make","great","turn","bore","ever","watch","okai","nice","bite","gore","bitterli","disappoint","expect","good","want","bad","cheesi","horror","mean","watch","see","horror","shouldn"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,11,12,17,24,26,37,44,51,56,58,72,83,88,92,96,108,130,154,187,191,219,228,262,313,350,358,448,542,543,699,1136,1339,1381,1391,1417,2539,5127,7231],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,11,12,17,24,26,37,44,51,56,58,72,83,88,92,96,108,130,154,187,191,219,228,262,313,350,358,448,542,543,699,1136,1339,1381,1391,1417,2539,5127,7231],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,2.0358433949768115,1.5932680941439847,1.9218995441445863,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.4876543214774305,1.604729392502474,1.7139899308309823,1.8610609350701788,1.865701314626681,1.9209463754160525,4.584637595480144,4.063444682693467,2.0489535369135887,2.0390708128715254,2.138507503627933,4.528427806839927,4.696999252276032,2.4732161909892554,2.5460113484259455,2.5792094178355414,2.7742700004069256,2.726701583487816,2.907069060519773,6.027137983886841,3.2030824725120812,3.2681460658591432,3.4471119148061256,3.477726550625732,3.5813614403160887,5.0768550934009715,4.506310234933358,8.899914596764454,4.429617614145104,4.733083554298147,5.259176650194926,6.342521466732247,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.035811045343494E-5,8.974880459064562E-5,9.044651596644198E-5,8.992391503362888E-5,8.992538833573368E-5,8.979969061336657E-5,9.006676747535177E-5,8.976172783207043E-5,8.996354491826774E-5,9.980964217040062E-5,0.6220955683594589,8.961683261307448E-5,9.128948635307244E-5,9.25917509354882E-5,8.968218027254212E-5,8.943433742048618E-5,9.16651650942634E-5,9.007520605161173E-5,8.97957480757295E-5,8.987017278547213E-5,9.073971941708768E-5,9.016444778750182E-5,9.02671136898342E-5,9.036436638055554E-5,9.10578664681136E-5,9.058165946123663E-5,9.438954034512647E-5,8.964347487571686E-5,8.964587304860382E-5,8.987299036102363E-5,9.178321973165244E-5,9.006998696259692E-5,0.23667593501164189,9.032334054460178E-5,8.974104776674615E-5,9.015526186009744E-5,8.965112499427147E-5,8.970410221308959E-5,8.943388809514392E-5,8.945709137181988E-5,8.965844841250893E-5,9.060415506249515E-5,9.014375727589055E-5,8.978735405831993E-5,9.087836455791885E-5,8.982181493544823E-5,9.280614780802063E-5,9.14414063530634E-5,8.947932634946111E-5,8.967708113272978E-5,8.964597774239361E-5,9.216895253907789E-5,8.96784153567353E-5,8.944914962629873E-5,9.043098205504267E-5,8.97015141358884E-5,9.646412000174719E-5,8.962758843265297E-5,8.947829157238455E-5,8.990552415276461E-5,9.079731139219646E-5,8.989957639095081E-5,8.946173788840381E-5,8.967003584335804E-5,8.943496981385167E-5,9.150430964425793E-5,0.06881577662423179,9.001325936544181E-5,0.06553853490501216,9.026236439

Don plays a small town schnook who gets accepted to Astronaut Training camp...but not as a candidate for space travel--they want him as their new janitor! Some may say the weak satire capitalizes on Americans' then-fresh fever for the new age of technology, but the flick is really just a dim excuse to keep restless children occupied. It gets off to a good start, with an OK set-up and nostalgic locations, but it becomes increasingly more spiritless and idiotic. * from

I have nothing against Adrianne Curry but this combination is not gonna have a happy ever after ending. Her mother said he was an old rooster and thinks this is his last attempt to recapture his youth. Here 2 very good people who are gonna end up in a nasty divorce. I don't think his old \" Brady Family\" is gonna fit into his new life. I see them being shut out. Chris said his friends were more important than his family.

{"value":"i rate this movie with 3 skulls, only coz the girls knew how to scream, this could've been a better movie, if actors were better, the twins were OK, i believed they were evil, but the eldest and youngest brother, they sucked really bad, it seemed like they were reading the scripts instead of acting them.... spoiler: if they're vampire's why do they freeze the blood? vampires can't drink frozen blood, the sister in the movie says let's drink her while she is alive....but then when they're moving to another house, they take on a cooler they're frozen blood. end of spoiler<br /><br />it

{"value":"I couldn't wait to see this movie. About half way through the movie, I couldn't wait for it to end. All of the (white) actors were delivering their lines like Woody Allen had just said, \"Say it like this...\" Then they said their lines on screen like they were trying to imitate Woody Allen. It was so annoying. We all know how Will Ferrell really talks, and he doesn't stumble over his words like Mr. Allen. The comedy portion of this film was just as boring as the tragedy and definitely never funny or even entertaining. I must admit that I have never been a major Woody Allen fan, and this movie definitely has not converted me. I think that his writing was just as bad as his direction. This movie will go down as one of the worst 10 movies I have ever seen.","finished_norm":["i","can","not","wait","to","see","thi","movi","about","half","wai","through","the","movi","i","can","not","wait","for","it","to","end","all","of","the","white","actor","be","deliv","their","line","like","woodi","allen","have","just","sai","sai","it","like","thi","then","thei","sai","their","line","on","screen","like","thei","be","try","to","imit","woodi","allen","it","be","so","annoi","we","all","know","how","will","ferrel","realli","talk","and","he","doe","not","stumbl","over","hi","word","like","mr","allen","the","comedi","portion","of","thi","film","be","just","a","bore","a","the","tragedi","and","definit","never","funni","or","even","entertain","i","must","admit","that","i","have","never","be","a","major","woodi","allen","fan","and","thi","movi","definit","have","not","convert","me","i","think","that","hi","write","be","just","a","bad","a","hi","direct","thi","movi","will","go","down","a","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see"],"filtered":["wait","see","thi","movi","half","wai","movi","wait","end","white","actor","deliv","line","like","woodi","allen","sai","sai","like","thi","thei","sai","line","screen","like","thei","try","imit","woodi","allen","annoi","know","ferrel","realli","talk","doe","stumbl","hi","word","like","mr","allen","comedi","portion","thi","film","bore","tragedi","definit","never","funni","even","entertain","must","admit","never","major","woodi","allen","fan","thi","movi","definit","convert","think","hi","write","bad","hi","direct","thi","movi","go","wrong","movi","ever","see"],"filtered2":["wait","see","half","wai","wait","end","white","actor","deliv","line","like","woodi","allen","like","line","screen","like","try","imit","woodi","allen","annoi","know","ferrel","realli","talk","doe","stumbl","word","like","mr","allen","comedi","portion","bore","tragedi","definit","never","funni","even","entertain","must","admit","never","major","woodi","allen","fan","definit","convert","think","write","bad","direct","go","wrong","ever","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,9,12,13,18,24,25,26,33,36,41,42,44,62,65,102,107,108,127,140,141,186,192,195,206,258,271,331,357,359,392,404,517,691,1345,1684,1760,1779,1880,2414,4337,4452],"values":[4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,9,12,13,18,24,25,26,33,36,41,42,44,62,65,102,107,108,127,140,141,186,192,195,206,258,271,331,357,359,392,404,517,691,1345,1684,1760,1779,1880,2414,4337,4452],"values":[2.5841531782306313,1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,3.2439908614907673,1.604729392502474,2.0226120445069267,1.9073850067444174,2.087553710177271,4.287906797278791,2.138507503627933,2.4359679371086367,2.317169775997098,2.2657547357741192,2.571852579609833,2.5318267134339894,2.51289241584188,2.597304642813496,2.7061321952397077,2.757740698455715,5.864548499100348,3.2829611516442836,3.2189558216683714,6.134186944718251,3.1419947805322432,3.4198487640477615,3.5929222627171646,19.04294034251463,4.724033718778229,15.470693403223525,4.715065048795469,4.911775343041523,5.170884043049248,6.342521466732247,5.999576715605417]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.991405677205862E-5,7.937517760486326E-5,7.999224392260831E-5,7.953004788503756E-5,7.953135089533133E-5,7.942018196018034E-5,7.965638870912721E-5,7.938660711178542E-5,7.956509714442345E-5,8.827313199421866E-5,0.3749339745672314,7.925845962509346E-5,8.073777946995761E-5,0.6188234575214367,7.931625406703577E-5,7.909705816253583E-5,8.107003533609883E-5,7.966385191147761E-5,7.941669512125714E-5,7.948251744146471E-5,8.025155741514464E-5,7.974277862998211E-5,7.983357788094446E-5,7.991958960704786E-5,8.053293139884089E-5,8.011176683938022E-5,8.347951332731977E-5,7.928202243842206E-5,7.928414341819107E-5,7.948500934718798E-5,8.117444461322038E-5,7.965923607152992E-5,8.550744185180385E-5,7.988330574755723E-5,7.93683173544401E-5,7.973465445916432E-5,7.92887883170512E-5,7.933564215729877E-5,7.909666077252035E-5,7.911718209551256E-5,7.929526525706087E-5,8.013166228370807E-5,7.972447963378523E-5,7.940927132741675E-5,8.037417723975088E-5,7.943974903968216E-5,8.207913741786626E-5,8.087213977744042E-5,7.913684704043704E-5,7.931174431194675E-5,7.928423601093586E-5,8.151559244507249E-5,7.9312924319501E-5,7.911015829765688E-5,7.997850550033246E-5,7.933335322332982E-5,8.531430243064862E-5,7.92679722318989E-5,7.91359318682004E-5,7.951378271647549E-5,8.030249261449046E-5,7.950852242746691E-5,7.912129154388656E-5,7.930551335324251E-5,7.909761746063379E-5,8.092777238372715E-5,7.977900630500622E-5,7.960906534090213E-5,7.953944361529182E-5,7.982937753078182E-5,7.90947318541040

{"value":"Marilyn Miller made only three films before her untimely death - the marvelous SALLY (1929), the comedy HER MAJESTY LOVE (1931) and this trifle - SUNNY (1930). It is quite poor both as an early talkie and as an attempt at a musical - although she has four dance numbers, she only sings two songs (WHO? and ONE MAN ALONE). The rest of the score including the spritely title tune are jettisoned, although we can hear the latter in the background scoring. Miller looks overweight and amateurish here - no star quality at all. Even her dancing is cloutish. The film is very badly written, stock full of stale and unfunny jokes and stupid situations. If you're interested in Miller as a performer, by all means, check it out, but for general entertainment, stay away.","finished_norm":["marilyn","miller","make","onli","three","film","befor","her","untim","death","the","marvel","salli","the","comedi","her","majesti","love","and","thi","trifl","sunni","it","be","quit","poor","both","a","a","earli","talki","and","a","a","attempt","at","a","music","although","she","have","four","danc","number","she","onli","sing","two","song","who","and","on","man","alon","the","rest","of","the","score","includ","the","sprite","titl","tune","be","jettison","although","we","can","hear","the","latter","in","the","background","score","miller","look","overweight","and","amateurish","here","no","star","qualiti","at","all","even","her","danc","be","cloutish","the","film","be","veri","badli","write","stock","full","of","stale","and","unfunni","joke","and","stupid","situat","if","you","re","interest","in","miller","a","a","perform","by","all","mean","check","it","out","but","for","gener","entertain","stai","awai"],"filtered":["marilyn","miller","make","onli","three","film","befor","untim","death","marvel","salli","comedi","majesti","love","thi","trifl","sunni","quit","poor","earli","talki","attempt","music","although","four","danc","number","onli","sing","two","song","man","alon","rest","score","includ","sprite","titl","tune","jettison","although","hear","latter","background","score","miller","look","overweight","amateurish","star","qualiti","even","danc","cloutish","film","veri","badli","write","stock","full","stale","unfunni","joke","stupid","situat","re","interest","miller","perform","mean","check","gener","entertain","stai","awai"],"filtered2":["marilyn","miller","make","onli","three","befor","untim","death","marvel","salli","comedi","majesti","love","trifl","sunni","quit","poor","earli","talki","attempt","music","although","four","danc","number","onli","sing","two","song","man","alon","rest","score","includ","sprite","titl","tune","jettison","although","hear","latter","background","score","miller","look","overweight","amateurish","star","qualiti","even","danc","cloutish","veri","badli","write","stock","full","stale","unfunni","joke","stupid","situat","re","interest","miller","perform","mean","check","gener","entertain","stai","awai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,11,15,16,45,47,54,60,65,68,79,88,100,105,118,120,127,136,146,155,177,195,214,216,224,225,226,237,245,264,266,301,319,328,336,365,448,457,473,492,504,518,606,659,801,948,1188,1233,1383,1389,1461,2687,2794,2877,2907,3620,3907,4860,5675,6978,8258],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,11,15,16,45,47,54,60,65,68,79,88,100,105,118,120,127,136,146,155,177,195,214,216,224,225,226,237,245,264,266,301,319,328,336,365,448,457,473,492,504,518,606,659,801,948,1188,1233,1383,1389,1461,2687,2794,2877,2907,3620,3907,4860,5675,6978,8258],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.926017105726131,1.982619630677639,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.8162961064622165,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,2.0064197866819473,1.9469506069506084,2.0317223413467334,2.1405462403177813,2.1765612129984904,2.354379525480895,2.2044500422972613,2.4359679371086367,2.346825985579986,2.326138445979858,2.3074766467914385,2.458149992634611,2.51289241584188,2.7303758068497004,2.6070186965339692,2.689504733779216,2.641219492619754,2.5940874818617203,5.280195575021108,2.7502029743242886,2.757740698455715,2.747702973022204,2.8309760279012264,2.9056060024680126,3.1550424959247185,2.9233055795674137,3.008694896185175,3.2681460658591432,3.3243163373261977,3.335489637924323,7.2033628856140925,3.41740676039221,6.820232654259061,3.584239140143704,3.8023521382691974,3.7881170224473255,4.049068857301474,4.213208095012239,4.364659717870332,4.520909034354511,4.449957298382227,4.4919214974812585,16.687088727548016,5.390512652256013,5.390512652256013,5.719991853386255,5.9370563586240825,5.822646007446338,6.1754673820690815,6.2980697041614135,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.5540932482839554E-5,5.516640699069772E-5,5.559527320117016E-5,5.5274043120337514E-5,5.527494872330242E-5,5.5197685391032585E-5,5.536185104129696E-5,5.517435059283628E-5,5.529840264640534E-5,6.135055911532579E-5,0.49675902392208865,5.508528702637882E-5,5.611342659209352E-5,5.6913896952571246E-5,5.5125454643034264E-5,5.497311167079507E-5,0.09056907701512606,5.5367038028850746E-5,5.519526200905156E-5,0.06551363381145435,5.577549822993988E-5,5.542189275304595E-5,5.5484998985802676E-5,5.554477784906158E-5,5.597105548309594E-5,5.567834261997736E-5,5.801895437041687E-5,5.510166337713676E-5,5.510313747567345E-5,5.524274096285895E-5,5.641691248955889E-5,0.02831742114824774,0.033243711233282514,5.55195602656778E-5,5.51616390597359E-5,5.5416246386923436E-5,5.5

{"value":"This was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares. For a horror or \"thriller\" film and hype, it's way too tame. There are only a few tense moments in here, not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre. Even those \"tense\" scenes weren't much. The music made them more dramatic that they actually were.<br /><br />There is a lot of symbolism in here, so the elitist critics label this \"a thinking person's horror film.\" Well, if they think about it, I'm sure they will come to the same conclusion I did - a waste of money at the video rental store.<br /><br />Summary: a yawner that offers an unlikeable lead character and generally poor acting.

{"value":"A gave it a \"2\" instead of a \"1\" (awful) because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning, a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork. But that wasn't enough to save it.<br /><br />The \"sepia\" toned, washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies. Nothing new there. I can see there were some hat-tips to other old, classic movies. OK. No problem with that.<br /><br />But a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting, not something that would put you to sleep.<br /><br />The story line and the script of this movie WAS awful, the characters two dimensional. Slow moving. Some of the scenes were pretty to look at, but ultimately, as a whole, it was quite boring, I couldn't recommend it.","finished_norm":["a","give","it","a","instead","of","a","aw","becaus","there","be","no","deni","that","mani","of","the","visual","be","stun","a","lot","of","talent","go","into","the","special","effect","and","artwork","but","that","be","not","enough","to","save","itbr","br","the","sepium","tone","wash","out","color","sort","of","thing","have","be","do","befor","mani","time","in","other","movi","noth","new","there","i","can","see","there","be","some","hattip","to","other","old","classic","movi","okai","no","problem","with","thatbr","br","but","a","movi","have","get","to","be","entertain","and","interest","not","someth","that","would","put","you","to","sleepbr","br","the","stori","line","and","the","script","of","thi","movi","be","aw","the","charact","two","dimension","slow","move","some","of","the","scene","be","pretti","to","look","at","but","ultim","a","a","whole","it","be","quit","bore","i","can","not","recommend","it"],"filtered":["give","instead","aw","becaus","deni","mani","visual","stun","lot","talent","go","special","effect","artwork","enough","save","itbr","br","sepium","tone","wash","color","sort","thing","befor","mani","time","movi","noth","new","see","hattip","old","classic","movi","okai","problem","thatbr","br","movi","get","entertain","interest","someth","put","sleepbr","br","stori","line","script","thi","movi","aw","charact","two","dimension","slow","move","scene","pretti","look","ultim","whole","quit","bore","recommend"],"filtered2":["give","instead","aw","becaus","deni","mani","visual","stun","lot","talent","go","special","effect","artwork","enough","save","itbr","sepium","tone","wash","color","sort","thing","befor","mani","time","noth","new","see","hattip","old","classic","okai","problem","thatbr","get","entertain","interest","someth","put","sleepbr","stori","line","script","aw","charact","two","dimension","slow","move","scene","pretti","look","ultim","whole","quit","bore","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,8,10,16,17,19,22,29,30,47,49,50,53,60,67,72,77,78,79,87,93,106,107,108,111,120,138,152,159,167,189,191,195,203,269,275,276,298,332,390,431,635,735,875,967,1555,1589,2604,2627,2672,4760,7182],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,8,10,16,17,19,22,29,30,47,49,50,53,60,67,72,77,78,79,87,93,106,107,108,111,120,138,152,159,167,189,191,195,203,269,275,276,298,332,390,431,635,735,875,967,1555,1589,2604,2627,2672,4760,7182],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.7064694353107215,1.6920303308087352,3.43598877114071,1.7003182735607676,1.838176641236591,1.9570915389266579,1.9209463754160525,1.9463902258768238,2.0064197866819473,1.9469506069506084,2.115024371522662,2.035389827120098,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955,2.138507503627933,2.1183455303375887,2.2044500422972613,4.581473037857885,2.3131195476980753,2.300267965194495,2.4609576687888097,2.498193474075453,2.5460113484259455,2.51289241584188,2.569760528637609,2.76533567167316,2.7832848715031413,2.7884729505849193,2.7819920465008363,2.9705344631698933,3.132778125427319,3.1419947805322432,3.587125145032839,3.7132521434831514,3.9282323841582003,4.110553940952155,4.589376833631972,4.558366596889411,5.214056214914456,5.290429193699031,5.259176650194926,6.137727054086234,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.613957779406533E-5,8.555871848321059E-5,8.622385593497466E-5,8.572565357680888E-5,8.572705809512642E-5,8.5607228799449E-5,8.586183669258133E-5,8.557103837961475E-5,8.576343326823546E-5,9.514984756975088E-5,0.9931828502386479,8.543290785734004E-5,8.702747071656825E-5,8.82689367094109E-5,8.549520464252208E-5,8.525893278459763E-5,8.738561021273526E-5,8.586988129856711E-5,8.560347032634912E-5,8.567442038321181E-5,8.650337064947722E-5,8.59549566217739E-5,8.605282937980723E-5,8.614554165185492E-5,8.68066644270283E-5,8.635269001002124E-5,8.998279305204311E-5,8.545830627751479E-5,8.54605924873406E-5,8.567710641512628E-5,8.749815325475209E-5,8.586490587221135E-5,9.216870268986641E-5,8.610643118163844E-5,8.555132380073691E-5,8.59461995560906E-5,8.546559923637662E-5,8.551610311742057E-5,8.525850443682585E-5,8.528062442634618E-5,8.547258074751954E-5,8.637413536323757E-5,8.593523208431297E-5,8.559546819890281E-5,8.663554288984906E-5,8.56283202073318E-5,8.847332407417135E-5,8.717229805516605E-5,8.53018213236326E-5,8.549034356532222E-5,8.546069229331049E-5,8.786587742479294E-5,8.549161549865439E-5,8.527305345565293E-5,8.620904725246999E-5,8.55136358693087E-5,9.196051718576722E-5,8.544316152192721E-5,8.530083485700509E-5,8.570812130765274E-5,8.65582738385247E-5,8.570245122791238E-5,8.528

{"value":"If you look at Corey Large's information here on IMDb, apparently there's a movie called \"Reload\" in production (as of June '08) in which he's playing a character named Sebastian Cole.<br /><br />First of all, how does such a crappy movie ever earn a sequel ... and second, didn't Sebastian get killed at the end of \"Loaded\"?<br /><br />I watched this in the wee hours of the morning when I was battling insomnia, and so I was drifting in and out while it was on. I'm sure I missed some plot points, but overall, it seemed really weak. Large's performance was (for me) one of the stronger parts of the film. I'm also a bit surprised at all the people commenting on the beautiful girls, since I thought the actress playing Brooke was pretty, but not exceptional.","finished_norm":["if","you","look","at","corei","larg","inform","here","on","imdb","appar","there","a","movi","call","reload","in","product","a","of","june","in","which","he","plai","a","charact","name","sebastian","colebr","br","of","all","how","doe","such","a","crappi","movi","ever","earn","a","sequel","and","do","not","sebastian","get","kill","at","the","end","of","loadedbr","br","i","watch","thi","in","the","wee","hour","of","the","morn","when","i","be","battl","insomnia","and","so","i","be","drift","in","and","out","while","it","be","on","i","be","sure","i","miss","some","plot","point","but","overal","it","seem","realli","weak","larg","perform","be","for","me","on","of","the","strong","part","of","the","film","i","be","conjur","a","bite","surpris","at","all","the","peopl","comment","on","the","beauti","girl","sinc","i","think","the","actress","plai","brook","be","pretti","but","not","except"],"filtered":["look","corei","larg","inform","imdb","appar","movi","call","reload","product","june","plai","charact","name","sebastian","colebr","br","doe","crappi","movi","ever","earn","sequel","sebastian","get","kill","end","loadedbr","br","watch","thi","wee","hour","morn","battl","insomnia","drift","sure","miss","plot","point","overal","seem","realli","weak","larg","perform","strong","part","film","conjur","bite","surpris","peopl","comment","beauti","girl","sinc","think","actress","plai","brook","pretti","except"],"filtered2":["look","corei","larg","inform","imdb","appar","call","reload","product","june","plai","charact","name","sebastian","colebr","doe","crappi","ever","earn","sequel","sebastian","get","kill","end","loadedbr","watch","wee","hour","morn","battl","insomnia","drift","sure","miss","plot","point","overal","seem","realli","weak","larg","perform","strong","part","conjur","bite","surpris","peopl","comment","beauti","girl","sinc","think","actress","plai","brook","pretti","except"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,10,12,13,16,18,23,24,32,35,39,40,44,61,66,76,78,84,105,119,142,143,154,162,174,190,233,255,280,308,325,326,354,379,387,412,564,592,631,786,1044,1077,1695,2059,2359,3709,3968,4248,4372,4400,4443,5579],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,10,12,13,16,18,23,24,32,35,39,40,44,61,66,76,78,84,105,119,142,143,154,162,174,190,233,255,280,308,325,326,354,379,387,412,564,592,631,786,1044,1077,1695,2059,2359,3709,3968,4248,4372,4400,4443,5579],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,3.2569937516641474,1.604729392502474,1.8818517047392527,1.929723173391612,2.1337665533324026,2.0064197866819473,2.2212694515902225,2.1765612129984904,2.1653408989309972,2.2844323215331563,2.3409902041158843,2.348499626138016,2.3586007221245198,2.456282578459816,2.558331832813986,2.6102777977348763,2.6754694156628323,2.8028805344481915,2.8753661172782943,2.973659465713028,2.942840385588056,3.0316467233633775,3.1272886331425473,3.360519385990158,3.107414446935464,6.939969152944234,3.509308122676031,3.607563812710113,3.900174431363043,4.125296222689358,4.235066888824737,4.770124825978496,4.911775343041523,5.390512652256013,12.685042933464494,5.822646007446338,5.907203395474402,6.437831646536572,6.2980697041614135,5.967828017290836,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.285761614315846E-5,7.236632020478493E-5,7.292889933953435E-5,7.250751538221294E-5,7.250870333621813E-5,7.240735065896165E-5,7.262270026503011E-5,7.237674048203872E-5,7.25394697790936E-5,0.13713834359467078,0.5726952286560499,7.225990846559205E-5,7.360860382362515E-5,7.465864673163144E-5,7.231259963703704E-5,7.211275881158925E-5,7.391152137448454E-5,7.262950446386581E-5,7.240417170919887E-5,7.246418189430327E-5,7.316531535522785E-5,0.048507111089517115,7.278424356775353E-5,7.286266042678155E-5,7.342184391259149E-5,7.303786833875958E-5,7.610824157216499E-5,7.22813906738304E-5,7.228332437030508E-5,7.246645376383391E-5,0.06186567429535973,7.262529620428456E-5,7.795710326146774E-5,7.282958044543983E-5,7.236006571699935E-5,7.269405512052974E-5,7.22875591228861E-5,7.233027575179317E-5,7.211239651125843E-5,7.213110579387663E-5,7.229346414670879E-5,7.305600700802987E-5,7.268477873597692E-5,7.239740343908724E-5,7.327710780418567E-5,7.242518995814093E-5,7.483151937098695E-5,7.373110006649993E-5,7.214903431692573E-5,7.23084880949824E-5,7.228340878707643E-5,7.43177356267287E-5,7.230956390743525E-5,7.212470219995702E-5,0.11854357678419432,0.055856491384671414,7.778101812229406E-5,7.226858110571503E-5,7.214819995473444E-5,7.249268643402202E-5,7.321175295772247E-5,7.248789063046918E-5,7.213485237644655E-5,

{"value":"We gave up at the point where George Clooney's character has his finger-nails extracted. We were not squeamish - having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like. To say this film was incomprehensible, boring, pretentious twaddle would be to over-praise it! How did people manage to sit through this confusing, slow, depressing pseud's corner of a film, let alone nominate it for an Oscar? Clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him. What was he thinking? Oh .. and what was with those subtitles? - did we just have a dud DVD or was the original film done like that - sentences left hanging in mid-air? The film was hard enough to follow without that as well.

{"value":"Four porn stars romping through the Irish woods sounds like a film to watch. We have Ginger Lynn Allen, Chasey Lain, Taylor Hayes, and Jenna Jameson all together in one film. Are you licking your lips? Well the mutant creatures who resulted from centuries of inbreeding were certainly licking their lips as they feasted on the entrails of their victims.<br /><br />Yes, there was some flesh exposed - far too little considering the cast - but, it was soon ripped open to expose dinner for these creatures. There was definitely some action that probably has not been seen before, and more than one person lost their head in the situation.<br /><br />Unfortunately, director Christian Viel did not show much

{"value":"At the end of this episode Holmes asks Watson not to record the case for posterity.For a good reason! The super sleuth left his little grey cells(sorry Agatha)at home for this tale. There is no deductive reasoning,no acute analysis of signs at crime scenes. Holmes bumbles along fifty yards behind the plot. The dastardly CAM is finally dealt to by an old frail-in a manner that would have made Charles Bronson's heart swell with pride-six bullets in the breadbasket.In an ensuing chase a pursuer gets hold of one of Watson's shoes.Mercifully the writer didn't decide to tack on the story of Cinderella to lengthen the film.The murderess,Holmes and Watson,escape scot free.

{"value":"I can find very little thats good to say about this film. I am sure the idea and script looked good on paper but the filmography and acting I am afraid is not the standards I would expect from some very talented people. I would doubt that this features highly in their CV Filmography. Michael Caine appeared wooden at times in his role as the Doctor, and at no time no did I actually believe in his character. The plot was unbelievable especially with regard to the victims son. Some of the scenes were very reminiscent of other films, that at times I wondered if it was actually a spoof thriller. The lighting at times was dark and this added to the feeling of watching a low budget movie with some big named stars, wondering why I bothered to watch it at

{"value":"I've got a question for those who thought of this idea. Why? What made them think to make a second movie of this. If memory serves, didn't Cinderella end with \"They all lived happily ever after\"? I'm pretty sure it did, or it was implied. Wait a minute, if they all lived happily ever after, how could there be a sequel? Unless they were trying to make the most boring story in history, there couldn't be a sequel. I mean sure, they could have Cinderella singing about nonsense for two hours, but why? A movie that ends in \"happily ever after\" can not have a sequel; if it does then they don't live happily ever after! Something's got to go wrong which causes problems with the first ending! Why? That's not right, it's evil. That's my final word on the matter.","finished_norm":["i","have","get","a","question","for","that","who","think","of","thi","idea","why","what","make","them","think","to","make","a","movi","of","thi","if","memori","serv","do","not","cinderella","end","with","thei","all","live","happili","ever","after","i","be","pretti","sure","it","do","or","it","be","impli","wait","a","minut","if","thei","all","live","happili","ever","after","how","can","there","be","a","sequel","unless","thei","be","try","to","make","the","much","bore","stori","in","histori","there","can","not","be","a","sequel","i","mean","sure","thei","can","have","cinderella","sing","about","nonsens","for","two","hour","but","why","a","movi","that","end","in","happili","ever","after","can","not","have","a","sequel","if","it","doe","then","thei","do","not","live","happili","ever","after","someth","get","to","go","wrong","which","caus","problem","with","the","end","why","that","not","right","it","evil","that","my","final","word","on","the","matt"],"filtered":["get","question","think","thi","idea","make","think","make","movi","thi","memori","serv","cinderella","end","thei","live","happili","ever","pretti","sure","impli","wait","minut","thei","live","happili","ever","sequel","unless","thei","try","make","much","bore","stori","histori","sequel","mean","sure","thei","cinderella","sing","nonsens","two","hour","movi","end","happili","ever","sequel","doe","thei","live","happili","ever","someth","get","go","wrong","caus","problem","end","right","evil","final","word","matt"],"filtered2":["get","question","think","idea","make","think","make","memori","serv","cinderella","end","live","happili","ever","pretti","sure","impli","wait","minut","live","happili","ever","sequel","unless","try","make","bore","stori","histori","sequel","mean","sure","cinderella","sing","nonsens","two","hour","end","happili","ever","sequel","doe","live","happili","ever","someth","get","go","wrong","caus","problem","end","right","evil","final","word","matt"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,12,17,18,24,25,36,44,47,53,59,78,88,108,116,119,121,123,156,167,174,258,321,331,378,387,408,453,460,499,659,815,905,1068,2203,2756,3144],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,12,17,18,24,25,36,44,47,53,59,78,88,108,116,119,121,123,156,167,174,258,321,331,378,387,408,453,460,499,659,815,905,1068,2203,2756,3144],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,2.133457220525776,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,3.9631084698357775,1.2796387880827016,1.4680183469605717,6.418917570009896,1.7064694353107215,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,2.0064197866819473,2.0317223413467334,2.138507503627933,6.739988699036795,4.3306817978619945,2.2190595059394194,2.2619070973220485,2.3451551414151686,2.4609576687888097,2.456282578459816,2.7061321952397077,3.09496984188738,2.932274249550174,3.130944944345658,10.081558157970473,3.130944944345658,3.2872346624216657,3.216957819005698,3.3814747511661465,3.8023521382691974,3.7881170224473255,3.9121030022283168,4.1554492608600455,5.02684467282631,21.290760223669007,12.875663293073144]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.393461924436802E-5,8.33686284844911E-5,8.40167400748736E-5,8.353129045566066E-5,8.353265902180905E-5,8.341589705751139E-5,8.366398762300921E-5,8.338063302224594E-5,8.356810308112581E-5,9.271424856550579E-5,0.8188397380142993,8.324603829714904E-5,8.479978432049852E-5,8.600947187739826E-5,8.3306740439861E-5,8.307651655275932E-5,8.514875633797245E-5,8.367182630712723E-5,8.341223479195753E-5,8.348136870415726E-5,8.428909990917716E-5,8.375472391404986E-5,8.3850091373356E-5,8.394043044225888E-5,8.458463012176765E-5,8.414227631862657E-5,0.17460529372909475,8.327078658105488E-5,8.327301426960591E-5,8.348398598034776E-5,8.52584185585474E-5,8.366697823928846E-5,8.980941356615617E-5,8.390232110262482E-5,8.336142308746275E-5,8.374619100742728E-5,8.327789285834238E-5,8.332710396587673E-5,8.307609916962314E-5,8.309765294253014E-5,8.328469566019652E-5,8.41631727242379E-5,8.37355042755985E-5,8.340443749903422E-5,8.441788886954107E-5,8.343644857790778E-5,8.620862743491147E-5,8.494090444010767E-5,8.311830725206427E-5,8.330200379412468E-5,8.327311152079167E-5,8.5616729906127E-5,8.330324316913293E-5,8.309027576982136E-5,8.400231045774088E-5,8.332469987316866E-5,8.960655709220713E-5,8.325602949347279E-5,8.311734603652436E-5,8.351420696890817E-5,8.434259771339228E-5,8.35086820290805E-5,8.310196914168844E-5,8.329545934916101E-5,8.307710398974842E-5,8.499933598287827E-5,8.379277424251622E-5,8.36142833650379E-5,8.354115889524774E-5,8.384567969904193E-5,8.307407320523882E-5,8.354291029650954E-5,8.48979208420087E-5,8.322294655884785E-5,8.52826711242736E-5,8.344297957453097E-5,8.409604617359418E-5,8.358208813449574E-5,8.304802703656498E-5,8.315097076986364E-5]}}

What they don't know is that there is a creepy inhabitant there who likes to kill...<br /><br />Yawn. Boring, pointless, utterly stupid \"horror\" film. Bach and her two buddies are certainly beautiful but the movie itself is dull dull DULL! Bach and her friends are no actresses--their faces are blank all the way through.

{"value":"I have no idea what the producers of The Shield were trying to do, but the result speaks for itself: The Shield is practically unwatchable.<br /><br />Supposedly the performances on The Shield are great...<br /><br />In reality, the show is so badly put together that you can't even really see the performances. For instance, the editing cuts away from reaction shots before they've had their full impact.<br /><br />I don't know what intellectual rationale there is for that, but it robs the show of all emotional impact.<br /><br />I'll give The Shield one point for ambition in its subject matter, but that's pretty much all I can give it.<br /><br />It's a shame to see a number of talented performer

{"value":"This has to be the WORST movie ever!!! The acting is scarier than the movie. Lots of blood, but no idea where it comes from, cuz they don't even show you the cuts. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. We laughed like we were watching a comedy and not a horror movie. This is a disgrace to horror films!!! For one if they are in Asia why is there a white cop driving past Waste Management trash cans?! There's so much of another language that you don't even know what's going on half the time. The film editing is a joke, my teenager could do better. And if I went to a movie theater and that nasty old man was working the window that would be the first clue. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!

{"value":"One of the most boring slashers ever.. If you can even call it that. I wouldn't watch this if it even ended up being some kind of porno movie, which it completely resembles. The fact that you're watching a small group of middle-aged people in the woods is really unbearable. They made these kinds of movies for teens, so who were they really aiming for when they made this sleep-fest? My favorite part of this movie is the cover art and it's the only reason I chose to seek out this movie, which happened to be part of a Suspense Classics 50 Movie Pack.. and after seeing the other movies in this 50 pack, you'll realize that it belongs nowhere else. So if you're in the mood for a decent slasher in the woods, I recommend Just Before Dawn and The Final Terror.","finished_norm":["on","of","the","much","bore","slasher","ever","if","you","can","even","call","it","that","i","would","not","watch","thi","if","it","even","end","up","be","some","kind","of","porno","movi","which","it","complet","resembl","the","fact","that","you","re","watch","a","small","group","of","middleag","peopl","in","the","wood","be","realli","unbear","thei","make","thi","kind","of","movi","for","teen","so","who","be","thei","realli","aim","for","when","thei","make","thi","sleepfest","my","favorit","part","of","thi","movi","be","the","cover","art","and","it","the","onli","reason","i","choos","to","seek","out","thi","movi","which","happen","to","be","part","of","a","suspens","classic","movi","pack","and","after","see","the","other","movi","in","thi","pack","you","will","realiz","that","it","belong","nowher","els","so","if","you","re","in","the","mood","for","a","decent","slasher","in","the","wood","i","recommend","just","befor","dawn","and","the","final","terror"],"filtered":["much","bore","slasher","ever","even","call","watch","thi","even","end","kind","porno","movi","complet","resembl","fact","re","watch","small","group","middleag","peopl","wood","realli","unbear","thei","make","thi","kind","movi","teen","thei","realli","aim","thei","make","thi","sleepfest","favorit","part","thi","movi","cover","art","onli","reason","choos","seek","thi","movi","happen","part","suspens","classic","movi","pack","see","movi","thi","pack","realiz","belong","nowher","els","re","mood","decent","slasher","wood","recommend","befor","dawn","final","terror"],"filtered2":["bore","slasher","ever","even","call","watch","even","end","kind","porno","complet","resembl","fact","re","watch","small","group","middleag","peopl","wood","realli","unbear","make","kind","teen","realli","aim","make","sleepfest","favorit","part","cover","art","onli","reason","choos","seek","happen","part","suspens","classic","pack","see","pack","realiz","belong","nowher","els","re","mood","decent","slasher","wood","recommend","befor","dawn","final","terror"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,11,13,23,24,44,61,68,79,94,95,97,103,108,122,142,156,196,298,309,332,363,382,405,410,491,529,584,655,731,799,822,881,1053,1129,1205,1238,1449,1514,1540,1962,2315,2539,3667],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,11,13,23,24,44,61,68,79,94,95,97,103,108,122,142,156,196,298,309,332,363,382,405,410,491,529,584,655,731,799,822,881,1053,1129,1205,1238,1449,1514,1540,1962,2315,2539,3667],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.852034211452262,1.9218995441445863,0.9913098153388195,2.2635883139467947,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.604729392502474,3.7637034094785053,4.012839573363895,1.9469506069506084,2.08112281984698,2.0323326556775485,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.138507503627933,4.497869534746497,2.2844323215331563,2.3451551414151686,2.478925055209576,2.7819920465008363,2.848772527704847,2.9705344631698933,3.0349689855553557,3.235085203598255,3.109204957709252,3.2070272508030975,3.369778711402955,3.4648563601051974,3.5146700658174166,7.459562890868725,8.19205168077849,3.7636829971100436,3.813163054373413,4.086456389373095,4.067587905068712,4.197121957260614,4.339813719283801,4.291900363587903,4.566029469634981,9.101523995008385,4.528289141652134,4.838444069955973,5.214056214914456,5.259176650194926,5.672363804397]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.682942712880793E-5,7.631134834042456E-5,7.690459630715037E-5,7.646024073039555E-5,7.646149344535531E-5,7.635461555744465E-5,7.658170488238418E-5,7.63223366759523E-5,7.64939371115915E-5,8.486584758581216E-5,9.883838276508496E-5,7.619913559734078E-5,7.762135467633676E-5,7.87286403570029E-5,7.625469921211661E-5,7.604396412429912E-5,7.794078568618559E-5,7.65888800100687E-5,7.635126330819364E-5,7.641454493045267E-5,7.71539004706865E-5,7.666476020953291E-5,7.675205466956839E-5,7.683474640003244E-5,7.742441360504024E-5,7.701950571852644E-5,8.025725942337798E-5,7.622178890168675E-5,7.622382801304197E-5,7.641694065026606E-5,7.804116483438804E-5,7.658444233848471E-5,0.993903030962075,7.679986307347779E-5,7.630475289112238E-5,7.66569496263259E-5,7.622829362188363E-5,7.62733389349413E-5,7.604358207327495E-5,7.606331128679634E-5,7.623452055630032E-5,7.703863321188522E-5,7.664716754246497E-5,7.634412606787675E-5,7.727178725130638E-5,7.637342736064214E-5,7.891093709619117E-5,7.775052876497299E-5,7.608221717787602E-5,7.625036353058603E-5,7.622391703176817E-5,7.836914458596283E-5,7.625149799063052E-5,7.605655860288417E-5,7.689138817887178E-5,7.6271138352307E-5,8.202122688298293E-5,7.620828102382623E-5,7.608133733068134E-5,7.644460338656326E-5,7.72028696050854E-5,7.643954614122514E-5,7.606726211318588E-5,7.624437308275936E-5,7.604450183386107E-5,7.780401398951719E-5,7.6699589

I remember that Tony may not been on from the start, because one of the episodes I remember is the one in which everybody trying to get Tony to join, but he rejects them, but typically at the end of the show he becomes a member of Power House, with everybody cheering.<br /><br />The other one I remember is the one where Lolo for some reason pretends to be dead,(complete with funeral and mourners). I don't remember why he plays dead, or how the show ends.<br /><br />This is one of those shows that I convinced myself that I must have dreamed up since no one else had ever heard of

{"value":"OK.... I just have 3 words - cheesy, cheesy and CHEESY! The only redeeming feature of this movie is Dean Cain.

There are some great possibilities, but they just don't follow through.... The special effects are decent - even though you KNOW the dragon is CGI, it doesn't horribly LOOK like CGI.... <br /><br />I wouldn't lay the blame on Dean Cain (although he IS one of the producers), I'd lay more of the blame on Phillip Roth - the director and writer.

failed.","finished_norm":["okai","i","just","have","word","cheesi","cheesi","and","cheesi","the","onli","redeem","featur","of","thi","movi","be","dean","cain","other","than","that","it","cheesebal","supremebr","br","the","movi","doe","have","some","promis","in","the","concept","a","underground","lab","creat","a","real","live","fire","breath","dragon","basic","give","u","much","of","jurass","park","meet","reign","of","fire","there","be","some","great","possibl","but","thei","just","do","not","follow","through","the","special","effect","be","decent","even","though","you","know","the","dragon","be","cgi","it","doe","not","horribli","look","like","cgi","br","br","i","would","not","lie","the","blame","on","dean","cain","although","he","be","on","of","the","produc","i","have","lie","much","of","the","blame","on","phillip","roth","the","director","and","writer","it","hi","job","to","make","thi","film","and","unfortun","he","fail"],"filtered":["okai","word","cheesi","cheesi","cheesi","onli","redeem","featur","thi","movi","dean","cain","cheesebal","supremebr","br","movi","doe","promis","concept","underground","lab","creat","real","live","fire","breath","dragon","basic","give","u","much","jurass","park","meet","reign","fire","great","possibl","thei","follow","special","effect","decent","even","though","know","dragon","cgi","doe","horribli","look","like","cgi","br","br","lie","blame","dean","cain","although","produc","lie","much","blame","phillip","roth","director","writer","hi","job","make","thi","film","unfortun","fail"],"filtered2":["okai","word","cheesi","cheesi","cheesi","onli","redeem","featur","dean","cain","cheesebal","supremebr","doe","promis","concept","underground","lab","creat","real","live","fire","breath","dragon","basic","give","u","jurass","park","meet","reign","fire","great","possibl","follow","special","effect","decent","even","though","know","dragon","cgi","doe","horribli","look","like","cgi","lie","blame","dean","cain","although","produc","lie","blame","phillip","roth","director","writer","job","make","unfortun","fail"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,11,16,18,26,30,51,58,80,86,106,112,116,191,203,215,227,237,258,260,261,286,287,289,305,309,350,362,402,543,551,634,650,683,726,898,935,1012,1277,1476,1806,1847,1908,2148,2284,2707,3335,5051,5805],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,11,16,18,26,30,51,58,80,86,106,112,116,191,203,215,227,237,258,260,261,286,287,289,305,309,350,362,402,543,551,634,650,683,726,898,935,1012,1277,1476,1806,1847,1908,2148,2284,2707,3335,5051,5805],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,2.430631986809635,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.7139899308309823,1.865701314626681,1.9951803900462557,2.031112399272319,2.159084361316692,2.2466628996789315,2.2466628996789315,2.5460113484259455,2.569760528637609,2.605934685587711,2.6005321873043625,2.640097787510554,2.7061321952397077,2.6754694156628323,2.7085302779237206,2.780700890737216,2.841890188081905,2.8282659991423613,2.8612813773965557,2.848772527704847,3.0135689919434205,3.058539100262467,3.084424928710765,10.433179651877197,7.056404144071986,3.5119855004467477,7.324245593921095,3.6105180246075443,3.7034641371169887,7.784600749864274,4.135246553542527,8.595530966080602,4.297765483040301,10.179516996473758,4.724033718778229,10.313795602149016,10.889159747052577,5.3064295350454715,5.185068678041204,5.583416318380505,5.999576715605417,6.342521466732247,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.165453041441819E-5,6.12387795021812E-5,6.17148526186248E-5,6.135826354272404E-5,6.135926882879049E-5,6.127350083289266E-5,6.145573680958166E-5,6.124759748628334E-5,6.138530441282995E-5,0.42084570093539425,0.3521508775086183,6.114873036033682E-5,6.229004108903604E-5,6.317862221253739E-5,6.119331937661815E-5,6.1024207444292454E-5,6.254637996397018E-5,6.146149474823336E-5,6.127081070020358E-5,6.132159330850941E-5,6.191491568960683E-5,6.152238753685033E-5,6.15924401084027E-5,6.165879905446602E-5,0.12664785834839504,6.18070657986959E-5,6.440531742870596E-5,6.116690931720246E-5,6.116854567527209E-5,6.132351583983131E-5,6.262693281301649E-5,6.145793357944857E-5,6.59698854902136E-5,6.163080567746981E-5,6.123348674724608E-5,6.151611965411469E-5,6.117212926331169E-5,6.120827749098603E-5,6.1023900853740246E-5,6.103973326900827E-5,6.117712629025474E-5,6.182241534202991E-5,6.150826966994249E-5,6.126508316562943E-5,6.200951816645467E-5,6.128859703932988E-5,6.332491277164685E-5,6.239370147118655E-5,6.105490497964239E-5,6.118984005341108E-5,6.11686171115429E-5,6.28901319324747E-5,6.119075044157785E-5,6.1034314335518835E-5,6.170425328218429E-5,6.120651155449494E-5,0.052484956994246025,6.1156069435955E-5,6.105419891469238E-5

Visually, the stroll through the Cabo de Gata in Andalucia was pleasant and surely the high point for me. The nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend.

{"value":"Hey look, deal with it, there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black America than this. Although I think this story is weak, my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story, which I have mentioned, blows.<br /><br />This was made in the mid-80's and is horrible in the music/score department. It's funny to see Oprah as a latter-day crack-whore type.<br /><br />The scene where Bigger stuffs Elizabeth McGovern into the incinerator. Pure classic cinema. First off, I don't care how drunk you are, you will react to 1200F degree flame (no matter how bad your acting). But they really milked that scene...it was comical. I'll tell you what though, I had great satisfaction in seeing Elizabeth McGovern burn in a faux death; she annoys me.","finished_norm":["hei","look","deal","with","it","there","be","much","well","portray","of","the","hardship","of","black","america","than","thi","although","i","think","thi","stori","be","weak","my","critic","be","focu","on","the","poor","execut","of","the","stori","which","i","have","mention","blowsbr","br","thi","be","make","in","the","mid","and","be","horribl","in","the","musicscor","depart","it","funni","to","see","oprah","a","a","latterdai","crackwhor","typebr","br","the","scene","where","big","stuff","elizabeth","mcgovern","into","the","inciner","pure","classic","cinema","off","i","do","not","care","how","drink","you","be","you","will","react","to","f","degre","flame","no","matt","how","bad","your","act","but","thei","realli","milk","that","sceneit","be","comic","i","will","tell","you","what","though","i","have","great","satisfact","in","see","elizabeth","mcgovern","burn","in","a","faux","death","she","annoi","me"],"filtered":["hei","look","deal","much","well","portray","hardship","black","america","thi","although","think","thi","stori","weak","critic","focu","poor","execut","stori","mention","blowsbr","br","thi","make","mid","horribl","musicscor","depart","funni","see","oprah","latterdai","crackwhor","typebr","br","scene","big","stuff","elizabeth","mcgovern","inciner","pure","classic","cinema","care","drink","react","f","degre","flame","matt","bad","act","thei","realli","milk","sceneit","comic","tell","though","great","satisfact","see","elizabeth","mcgovern","burn","faux","death","annoi"],"filtered2":["hei","look","deal","well","portray","hardship","black","america","although","think","stori","weak","critic","focu","poor","execut","stori","mention","blowsbr","make","mid","horribl","musicscor","depart","funni","see","oprah","latterdai","crackwhor","typebr","scene","big","stuff","elizabeth","mcgovern","inciner","pure","classic","cinema","care","drink","react","f","degre","flame","matt","bad","act","realli","milk","sceneit","comic","tell","though","great","satisfact","see","elizabeth","mcgovern","burn","faux","death","annoi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,9,12,13,16,17,19,20,21,51,62,82,86,90,146,205,229,230,237,245,271,285,332,361,379,408,409,468,480,579,619,662,667,725,809,862,974,1096,1423,1630,1739,2089,2476,2759,2960,3016,5040,5735,6438,7785],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,9,12,13,16,17,19,20,21,51,62,82,86,90,146,205,229,230,237,245,271,285,332,361,379,408,409,468,480,579,619,662,667,725,809,862,974,1096,1423,1630,1739,2089,2476,2759,2960,3016,5040,5735,6438,7785],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.7139899308309823,2.0226120445069267,2.020196584395323,2.031112399272319,2.0477128419653545,2.326138445979858,2.571852579609833,2.8432628718938773,2.7121382192999195,2.640097787510554,2.7502029743242886,2.757740698455715,2.808171552082607,2.9705344631698933,3.0399731661399314,3.1272886331425473,3.130944944345658,3.2209578243390444,3.304513710030018,3.43462735814388,3.5642670069567886,3.5929222627171646,3.616452760127359,3.6652429242967908,3.6466665387238555,3.90413483257914,3.944626193933877,4.030886538218284,4.429617614145104,4.484804029712395,4.654440426979034,4.733083554298147,4.9676558014359795,5.185068678041204,10.889159747052577,5.521540914662417,5.501738287366237,6.794506590475304,6.389041482367141,6.489124940924123,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.106129615108405E-5,7.05821132183624E-5,7.113082184512144E-5,7.071982719871831E-5,7.072098586346533E-5,7.062213205798154E-5,7.08321721737984E-5,7.059227658146851E-5,7.075099375316066E-5,7.849436542455877E-5,0.6456606505969145,7.047832508318819E-5,7.179376807087071E-5,7.281792194807915E-5,7.052971714261603E-5,7.033480343514145E-5,7.208921712521094E-5,7.083880861366743E-5,7.061903148589997E-5,7.067756210715179E-5,7.13614089737621E-5,7.090899194741908E-5,7.09897325921011E-5,7.106621606682361E-5,7.161161276508859E-5,7.123710419053906E-5,0.1040563398206286,7.049927764302221E-5,7.050116366379983E-5,7.067977796325689E-5,7.21820600975508E-5,7.083470410961948E-5,7.603505433198276E-5,7.103395167944403E-5,7.057601293630087E-5,7.090176776018864E-5,7.050529400765702E-5,7.054695744901059E-5,7.033445006740219E-5,7.035269806868588E-5,7.051105344186387E-5,7.125479564706805E-5,7.089272008686614E-5,7.06124300889247E-5,7.147044515615981E-5,7.063953152545267E-5,7.29865323758143E-5,7.191324414287416E-5,7.037018456019337E-5,7.052570697150354E-5,7.050124599925777E-5,7.248541607883569E-5,0.032747159547935854,7.03464523567337E-5,7.111860534487822E-5,0.040373064882912105,7.586331060929442E-5,7.048678389752793E-5,7.036937076937903E-5,7.0705

{"value":"Sheesh! What a dreadful movie. Dodgy camera work, a script with more corn than Kellogg's, and acting so hammy you could open a pig farm with it. <br /><br />To cap it all, it doesn't know which audience to aim at - we have Cornel Wilde - or is that Corny Wilde? - getting on his soap box about the hazards of smoking any time someone lights a cigarette, dear oh dear, and in another awkward scene we have the baddie, Lobo, forcing his, ahem, if you will, 'male friend' to do a striptease dressed in a bikini. Try explaining that one to the kids...<br /><br />Throw in an overly contrived Treasure Island-cum-Jaws type storyline, and the result is a film so unintentionally funny, it's enjoyable - I shouldn't

{"value":"I had to watch this in school. And to sum it up...<br /><br />Talentless actors, talentless script, and a talentless director.<br /><br />This movie is such a waste of your time. Don't even watch the movie. Don't bother. You will be so disappointed. My teacher said it was supposed to be good. How wrong she was. She even slept through it a little. The movie's actors were just bad. The best actor in there was the old man and that's not saying much. It's has horrible plot with awful characters. So unrealistic and I can honestly said it had no point. The script was unemotional and confusing. There was points in the movie when I furrowed my brows and said, \"What?\". Also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes. It was just absolutely horrendous.","finished_norm":["i","have","to","watch","thi","in","school","and","to","sum","it","upbr","br","talentless","actor","talentless","script","and","a","talentless","directorbr","br","thi","movi","be","such","a","wast","of","your","time","do","not","even","watch","the","movi","do","not","bother","you","will","be","so","disappoint","my","teacher","sai","it","be","suppos","to","be","good","how","wrong","she","be","she","even","sleep","through","it","a","littl","the","movi","actor","be","just","bad","the","well","actor","in","there","be","the","old","man","and","that","not","sai","much","it","have","horribl","plot","with","aw","charact","so","unrealist","and","i","can","honestli","sai","it","have","no","point","the","script","be","unemot","and","confus","there","be","point","in","the","movi","when","i","furrow","my","brow","and","sai","what","conjur","there","be","just","too","mani","loos","tie","and","plot","hole","it","be","just","absolut","horrend"],"filtered":["watch","thi","school","sum","upbr","br","talentless","actor","talentless","script","talentless","directorbr","br","thi","movi","wast","time","even","watch","movi","bother","disappoint","teacher","sai","suppos","good","wrong","even","sleep","littl","movi","actor","bad","well","actor","old","man","sai","much","horribl","plot","aw","charact","unrealist","honestli","sai","point","script","unemot","confus","point","movi","furrow","brow","sai","conjur","mani","loos","tie","plot","hole","absolut","horrend"],"filtered2":["watch","school","sum","upbr","talentless","actor","talentless","script","talentless","directorbr","wast","time","even","watch","bother","disappoint","teacher","suppos","good","wrong","even","sleep","littl","actor","bad","well","actor","old","man","horribl","plot","aw","charact","unrealist","honestli","point","script","unemot","confus","point","furrow","brow","conjur","mani","loos","tie","plot","hole","absolut","horrend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,9,10,14,20,25,32,39,41,45,50,66,67,77,89,138,149,187,222,230,296,427,496,732,757,810,940,1114,1148,1175,1264,1686,2781,4872,6150,6580],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,7,8,9,10,14,20,25,32,39,41,45,50,66,67,77,89,138,149,187,222,230,296,427,496,732,757,810,940,1114,1148,1175,1264,1686,2781,4872,6150,6580],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,2.742262257014735,1.5538940054862738,4.70627975028631,1.8162961064622165,1.717994385570355,3.859446346783224,1.9570915389266579,3.8927804517536475,1.9940046109572438,2.2907365189289424,2.3253197803590226,2.4732161909892554,2.5771019354959765,2.7121382192999195,2.9504565686333644,3.233054746047873,3.293679367864308,3.7099788181381825,3.7165362186843414,3.8425769395797067,3.952924996748572,4.364659717870332,4.176068548062782,4.263079925052412,4.327618446189983,4.662879295624898,5.322690055917252,18.413181162258702,6.489124940924123,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.361759581485303E-5,9.29863104802662E-5,9.37091903772334E-5,9.31677376769163E-5,9.316926412540297E-5,9.303903211293215E-5,9.33157432304108E-5,9.299969990138462E-5,9.320879712917456E-5,1.0341007234706366E-4,0.44608795271458856,9.28495778815748E-5,9.45825692089004E-5,9.59318103418635E-5,9.291728282516856E-5,9.266049954547249E-5,0.25536667768904503,9.332448621117472E-5,9.303494735625519E-5,9.311205678628155E-5,9.401297054700812E-5,9.341694716148066E-5,9.352331652777538E-5,9.362407741184177E-5,9.434259410689854E-5,9.384920889919233E-5,0.049424479396386674,9.287718120974458E-5,9.287966589184892E-5,9.311497600014995E-5,0.2419997849375306,9.331907885412111E-5,1.0017012593012439E-4,9.358157165215942E-5,9.297827384469486E-5,9.34074298703973E-5,9.288510729079241E-5,9.293999555520853E-5,9.266003401163086E-5,9.268407429939839E-5,9.28926948864725E-5,9.387251598358867E-5,9.339551028167534E-5,9.302625054171171E-5,9.415661702977422E-5,9.306195452500921E-5,9.615394114623721E-5,9.473996941441573E-5,9.270711135870965E-5,9.291199974424136E-5,9.28797743622546E-5,9.549376035179973E-5,9.291338209766871E-5,9.267584607153337E-5,9.369309611152213E-5,9.293731411837744E-5,9.994386725929755E-5,9.286072169550478E-5,9.270603925415118E-5,9.314868338236774E-5,9.407264003567778E-5,9.314252106712351E-5,9.268888842963328E-5,9.290470031036107E-5,9.266115475114456E-5,9.480514181411423E-5,9.345938710227096E-5,9.326030492408468E-5,9.317874457248458E-5,9.35183959080535E-5,9.265777432526338E-5,9.318069802121543E-5,9.469202708561594E-5,9.282382220361491E-5,9.512116343887512E-5,9.306923895910377E-5,9.379764549101739E-5,9.32243955447702E-5,9.26287233840262E-5,9.274354304845533E-5]}}
{"value":"No doubt, when Madonna and Guy Ritchie married, it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers. If you've been through the ordeal of watching \"Swept Away,\" then you know at that level it was a match made in hell. After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress (or \"octress\" as she might have pronounced it in \"The Next Best Thing\"), she still can't get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent. And that's the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen: that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience. If there's any justice in this universe, she just blew her last

{"value":"This movie was bad from the start. The only purpose of the movie was that Angela wanted to get a high body count. The acting was horrible. The killings were acted out very badly. Like when Ally got stuffed down that toilet I guess it was in the abandoned cabin. But when the end of the movie comes and Molly and the other guy are in the cabin you see Ally so Angela must have gone in to get her. The part that really got me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin and Angela took the guitar string and chocked her. One it was horrible acting and two why wouldn't you just turn around and punch the bitch?!?!? Then when Molly is getting chased by Angela if you have the neigh why not just turn around and stab her??? So stupid.

sucked...","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","bad","from","the","start","the","onli","purpos","of","the","movi","be","that","angela","want","to","get","a","high","bodi","count","the","act","be","horribl","the","kill","be","act","out","veri","badli","like","when","alli","get","stuff","down","that","toilet","i","guess","it","be","in","the","abandon","cabin","but","when","the","end","of","the","movi","come","and","molli","and","the","other","gui","be","in","the","cabin","you","see","alli","so","angela","must","have","go","in","to","get","her","the","part","that","realli","get","me","be","when","the","black","girl","and","angela","be","in","the","cabin","and","angela","take","the","guitar","string","and","chock","her","on","it","be","horribl","act","and","two","why","would","not","you","just","turn","around","and","punch","the","bitch","then","when","molli","be","get","chase","by","angela","if","you","have","the","neigh","why","not","just","turn","around","and","stab","her","so","stupid","thi","movi","suck"],"filtered":["thi","movi","bad","start","onli","purpos","movi","angela","want","get","high","bodi","count","act","horribl","kill","act","veri","badli","like","alli","get","stuff","toilet","guess","abandon","cabin","end","movi","come","molli","gui","cabin","see","alli","angela","must","go","get","part","realli","get","black","girl","angela","cabin","angela","take","guitar","string","chock","horribl","act","two","turn","around","punch","bitch","molli","get","chase","angela","neigh","turn","around","stab","stupid","thi","movi","suck"],"filtered2":["bad","start","onli","purpos","angela","want","get","high","bodi","count","act","horribl","kill","act","veri","badli","like","alli","get","stuff","toilet","guess","abandon","cabin","end","come","molli","gui","cabin","see","alli","angela","must","go","get","part","realli","get","black","girl","angela","cabin","angela","take","guitar","string","chock","horribl","act","two","turn","around","punch","bitch","molli","get","chase","angela","neigh","turn","around","stab","stupid","suck"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,9,11,13,15,21,24,31,34,37,47,55,61,71,76,84,96,98,136,141,211,229,230,243,361,376,421,448,530,794,884,1487,1542,1584,1610,1729,1891,2281,2928,3094,3179,4221,6266],"values":[1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,9,11,13,15,21,24,31,34,37,47,55,61,71,76,84,96,98,136,141,211,229,230,243,361,376,421,448,530,794,884,1487,1542,1584,1610,1729,1891,2281,2928,3094,3179,4221,6266],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,3.983170235359962,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,3.4860466360051467,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.7064694353107215,1.9536997889255368,1.8818517047392527,1.9214926742550966,2.1337665533324026,2.2212694515902225,4.078141625743051,4.176398159347389,2.346825985579986,2.2657547357741192,2.5687161421197025,2.8432628718938773,5.424276438599839,2.627841366673578,3.0399731661399314,3.1569204307489187,3.2597778161886266,3.2681460658591432,3.5784919978881358,3.7465885637507435,3.9323057095458362,4.558366596889411,4.597282013139085,4.706176101378222,15.154611856250042,4.6973654716960676,4.869215728622727,10.678438715736926,5.426230734858092,11.43998370677251,29.83914008645418,6.032366538428407,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.1925800697599707,6.41699518730021E-5,6.466881205961194E-5,6.429515497459157E-5,6.429620837831757E-5,6.420633512784216E-5,6.439729376465244E-5,6.41791919267728E-5,6.432349014631454E-5,7.13634010363602E-5,0.3853486858469429,6.407559256105414E-5,6.527153172130734E-5,6.620264446381895E-5,6.41223158147195E-5,6.394510939998187E-5,6.55401401651957E-5,6.440332730498703E-5,6.420351623290998E-5,6.425672953267626E-5,6.487845107823451E-5,6.446713470524433E-5,6.454054031818498E-5,6.461007551156803E-5,6.51059246478936E-5,6.476543899070562E-5,6.748805500962476E-5,6.409464164721575E-5,6.409635632898161E-5,6.425874408527519E-5,6.562454864767291E-5,6.439959568212665E-5,6.912751056417911E-5,6.458074224155168E-5,6.416440578223701E-5,6.446056681253383E-5,6.410011144418644E-5,6.41379898939043E-5,6.394478813458206E-5,6.39613783627682E-5,6.410534765204444E-5,0.4170876964509797,6.445234109166498E-5,6.419751455193328E-5,6.497758166894422E-5,6.422215390882401E-5,6.635593716843914E-5,6.538015377073108E-5,6.397727626192847E-5,6.411866995494628E-5,6.409643118452407E-5,6.590034569924622E-5,6.411962391851841E-5,6.395570005395725E-5,6.465770538970764E-5,6.4136139431492E-5,6.897136921452434E-5,6.408328291891299E-5,6.39765364014311E-5,6.428200558563485E-5,6.49196290559007E-5,6.427775296532325E-5,6.396470059916932E-5,6.411363260785316E-5,6.394556155811381E-5,6.542512931315772E-5,6.449642255357319E-5,6.4359035730426
