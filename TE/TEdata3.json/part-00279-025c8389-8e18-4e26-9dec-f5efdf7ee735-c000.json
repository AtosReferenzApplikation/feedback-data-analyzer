{"value":"The Tooth Fairy is about the ghost of an old deformed witch that lures children to her house to get a prize for their loose tooth and then takes their lives. The first few minutes introduce you to the 1949 beginning of the legend of the tooth fairy and then switches to present day. The worn out horror plot is pretty much saved by the solid acting. They could have done without the Hammond brothers and a few other scenes, but overall the gore scenes were bloody but quick which had a minimizing effect. The eye candy is pretty good for both genders. Camera work is good. Dialog is fair but cheesy. I expected the film to be a bare bones, low budget, slasher with very few redeeming factors. I was surprised by the quality of the film.","finished_norm":["the","tooth","fairi","be","about","the","ghost","of","a","old","deform","witch","that","lure","child","to","her","hous","to","get","a","prize","for","their","loos","tooth","and","then","take","their","live","the","few","minut","introduc","you","to","the","begin","of","the","legend","of","the","tooth","fairi","and","then","switch","to","present","dai","the","wear","out","horror","plot","be","pretti","much","save","by","the","solid","act","thei","can","have","do","without","the","hammond","brother","and","a","few","other","scene","but","overal","the","gore","scene","be","bloodi","but","quick","which","have","a","minim","effect","the","ey","candi","be","pretti","good","for","both","gender","camera","work","be","good","dialog","be","fair","but","cheesi","i","expect","the","film","to","be","a","bare","bone","low","budget","slasher","with","veri","few","redeem","factor","i","be","surpris","by","the","qualiti","of","the","film"],"filtered":["tooth","fairi","ghost","old","deform","witch","lure","child","hous","get","prize","loos","tooth","take","live","minut","introduc","begin","legend","tooth","fairi","switch","present","dai","wear","horror","plot","pretti","much","save","solid","act","thei","without","hammond","brother","scene","overal","gore","scene","bloodi","quick","minim","effect","ey","candi","pretti","good","gender","camera","work","good","dialog","fair","cheesi","expect","film","bare","bone","low","budget","slasher","veri","redeem","factor","surpris","qualiti","film"],"filtered2":["tooth","fairi","ghost","old","deform","witch","lure","child","hous","get","prize","loos","tooth","take","live","minut","introduc","begin","legend","tooth","fairi","switch","present","dai","wear","horror","plot","pretti","save","solid","act","without","hammond","brother","scene","overal","gore","scene","bloodi","quick","minim","effect","ey","candi","pretti","good","gender","camera","work","good","dialog","fair","cheesi","expect","bare","bone","low","budget","slasher","veri","redeem","factor","surpris","qualiti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,15,19,21,31,32,48,59,67,78,83,106,116,125,130,132,147,180,189,213,217,231,256,281,319,326,358,381,411,412,432,514,543,594,634,727,731,877,929,940,1135,1173,1181,1212,1377,1519,1572,1579,1787,2066,2295,2416,2919,3190,4174,5726],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,15,19,21,31,32,48,59,67,78,83,106,116,125,130,132,147,180,189,213,217,231,256,281,319,326,358,381,411,412,432,514,543,594,634,727,731,877,929,940,1135,1173,1181,1212,1377,1519,1572,1579,1787,2066,2295,2416,2919,3190,4174,5726],"values":[1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.2000607798565692,2.62476135602347,1.162015545335049,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.6955116224012472,1.8693254449200722,1.9570915389266579,4.012839573363895,2.292318797740072,2.159084361316692,2.2466628996789315,2.2242236634876535,2.2642139034199635,2.253494045787767,2.2844323215331563,2.7097314792693545,2.498193474075453,2.8432628718938773,2.6113665294700725,2.7049353070058615,2.748952192422636,2.832333801361687,2.9056060024680126,2.942840385588056,3.2030824725120812,3.24941502915308,3.229006157521873,3.107414446935464,3.235085203598255,3.405285399859865,3.477726550625732,3.496027715008137,3.5119855004467477,4.096025840389245,4.096025840389245,3.865219416329466,3.9954846111673676,3.952924996748572,4.4919214974812585,4.2574141875167335,4.274508620876034,13.652285992512578,4.558366596889411,4.550761997504193,4.573751515728891,4.605250182788262,4.828393734102471,4.933754249760298,11.124725818365345,5.156897801074508,5.408212229355414,5.5623629091826725,5.967828017290836,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.920127146537863E-4,1.9184256248006755E-4,1.9188992989069279E-4,1.918513538767775E-4,1.9186951033173372E-4,1.9184150471805353E-4,1.9190117008941637E-4,1.9181296183106022E-4,1.9184260302403195E-4,1.920408515661205E-4,1.9356463982783133E-4,1.91842919898403E-4,1.9202460726677875E-4,1.9204461291790414E-4,1.919573720646653E-4,1.9185210955149286E-4,1.9191811409701814E-4,1.9200843141398176E-4,1.9186201404870206E-4,1.918613125821428E-4,1.920339209987117E-4,1.9188053512690648E-4,1.918808255214675E-4,1.920037464327323E-4,1.9186208325816165E-4,1.9204690832504067E-4,1.9191009600166015E-4,1.9184213252107854E-4,1.919291055456041E-4,1.9198768507521283E-4,1.9188147633198647E-4,1.9198424387219219E-4,1.920785033430813E-4,1.9225678197762146E-4,1.9190976437561893E-4,1.9185199319014709E-4,1.91921166668338E-4,1.918714775516532E-4,1.9181316655584124E-4,1.9186195463215852E-4,1.92054233097967E-4,1.919488792618561E-4,1.9198468137120585E-4,1.9182271307573024E-4,1.918620034177932E-4,1.9185192104647256E-4,1.9191686118228812E-4,1.919501398058933E-4,1.9191110782963282E-4

{"value":"This was an excellent idea and the scenery was beautiful but that's where it ends. It seemed like a lackluster Set It Off meets The West. The plot barely made any sense. There were so many characters and not enough time to develop their personalities. There were too may unnecessary things going on that didn't pertain to the plot nor did it help further the story along. There were also long blank moments where the plot could have been explored but was used for silence or unnecessary conversations. The script should have made more sense as well as the directing. I had a huge question mark on my head watching this movie. But the casting was great in my opinion.

{"value":"There is absolutely NO reason to waste your time with this \"film\". The original said it all and still holds up. Either read the book or do some research about the story, and you'll realize this remake is ludicrous. Eric Roberts as Perry Smith? His sister could have done a better job! Having been to Holcomb & Edgerton, KS where the story takes place, the sets and locations looked NOTHING like Kansas. The original is riveting, from the location filming to the use of the actual participants, weapons and victims belongings. Unforgettable performances by Scott Wilson and Robert Blake. Soundtrack by Quincy Jones and cinematography by Conrad Hall...The original is available on DVD in widescreen now.

{"value":"As the front cover says \"The hamlet of our time, for our time\".<br /><br />I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was truly a disappointing experience.<br /><br />This version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality; one very VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (60's) this was a very well done version of Hamlet but cannot compare to Branagh's complete version.<br /><br />just a note... I found the video at my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if such a thing even exists.

{"value":"I really don't get all the adulation that this film has received. It's mawkish, unnecessarily manipulative and dodges many of the big issues - ie Nash's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. That, I suppose, in the context of a commercial Hollywood film is just about tolerable, but what's with all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to shuffle about, clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and somehow that seems to qualify as fine acting? Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that Crowe's performance is little short of caricature. It is also rather offensive.

{"value":"This movie was a real disappointment to me. I have been a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when i found out they were making a film about him i was very exited, I got the movie on VHS when it came out, and was sickened by what i saw, This film wasn't about his life, it was about the aftermath of his death. I thought it would be a descent film about Grams Life and Music, but they had to make a film about his death. I am tired of hearing about his deaths in books and movies, i wanted a film about his life, not his infamous death. I was very Disappointed. I wish people would look at his life, more then his death. The only thing good about this film was its soundtrack. This film is a disappointment to any Gram Parsons Fan.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","a","real","disappoint","to","me","i","have","be","a","fan","of","gram","parson","for","a","long","time","and","when","i","find","out","thei","be","make","a","film","about","him","i","be","veri","exit","i","get","the","movi","on","vh","when","it","come","out","and","be","sicken","by","what","i","see","thi","film","be","not","about","hi","life","it","be","about","the","aftermath","of","hi","death","i","think","it","would","be","a","descent","film","about","gram","life","and","music","but","thei","have","to","make","a","film","about","hi","death","i","be","tire","of","hear","about","hi","death","in","book","and","movi","i","want","a","film","about","hi","life","not","hi","infam","death","i","be","veri","disappoint","i","wish","peopl","would","look","at","hi","life","much","then","hi","death","the","onli","thing","good","about","thi","film","be","it","soundtrack","thi","film","be","a","disappoint","to","ani","gram","parson","fan"],"filtered":["thi","movi","real","disappoint","fan","gram","parson","long","time","find","thei","make","film","veri","exit","get","movi","vh","come","sicken","see","thi","film","hi","life","aftermath","hi","death","think","descent","film","gram","life","music","thei","make","film","hi","death","tire","hear","hi","death","book","movi","want","film","hi","life","hi","infam","death","veri","disappoint","wish","peopl","look","hi","life","much","hi","death","onli","thing","good","thi","film","soundtrack","thi","film","disappoint","ani","gram","parson","fan"],"filtered2":["real","disappoint","fan","gram","parson","long","time","find","make","veri","exit","get","vh","come","sicken","see","life","aftermath","death","think","descent","gram","life","music","make","death","tire","hear","death","book","want","life","infam","death","veri","disappoint","wish","peopl","look","life","death","onli","thing","good","soundtrack","disappoint","ani","gram","parson","fan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,8,11,12,15,16,23,27,29,34,37,38,75,80,99,118,140,151,187,216,245,399,796,900,2181,2551,2994,3193,3235,3336,3718,7955],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,8,11,12,15,16,23,27,29,34,37,38,75,80,99,118,140,151,187,216,245,399,796,900,2181,2551,2994,3193,3235,3336,3718,7955],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.364847727375781,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,7.89690009948107,1.9951803900462557,2.056430207256609,2.354379525480895,4.634339551994196,2.8002454868101863,7.419648572967766,2.6070186965339692,13.751014871621443,3.129115117668582,3.850067611308864,3.9201351739255808,5.039114765418124,5.185068678041204,5.521540914662417,21.10700594187658,13.451027437976705,5.604922523601468,5.822646007446338,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.409702074900608E-4,2.4075667160687817E-4,2.4081611628889941E-4,2.4076770454651005E-4,2.4079049035382477E-4,2.4075534414722295E-4,2.4083022240173433E-4,2.4071952367870058E-4,2.4075672248833948E-4,2.4100551847254197E-4,2.42917827114485E-4,2.4075712015618706E-4,2.4098513236326804E-4,2.41010238856405E-4,2.4090075419782664E-4,2.4076865289565075E-4,2.4085148662392338E-4,2.4096483215235834E-4,2.4078108274307983E-4,2.4078020242355183E-4,2.409968208179646E-4,2.4080432614165324E-4,2.4080469057813207E-4,2.4095895264117178E-4,2.407811695988793E-4,2.410131195236304E-4,2.408414241543334E-4,2.4075613202122111E-4,2.4086528056278385E-4,2.4093879611840704E-4,2.4080550732584629E-4,2.4093447751165543E-4,2.4105277032522777E-4,2.4127650467341215E-4,2.4084100797358148E-4,2.40768506865646E-4,2.408553175095272E-4,2.4079295915591963E-4,2.4071978060217074E-4,2.407810081770968E-4,2.4102231189432864E-4,2.4089009598459948E-4,2.4093502655981761E-4,2.407317611987818E-4,2.4078106940160753E-4,2.4076841632749465E-4,2.4084991425345296E-4,2.4089167792962194E-4,2.4084269396814213E-4,2.4080451997563948E-4,2.407690117292874E-4,2.4126230833403922E-4,2.4082959614816156E-4,2.4078101421489212E-4,2.4082830641647597E-4,2.40756378347473E-4,0.9809713522425287,2.4079394036305156E-4,2.407693497381635E-4,2.407562409175925E-4,2.4094885168561976E-4,2.4085212877650373E-4,2.4075614027516226E-4,2.407316631192187E-4,2.4070745489132746E-4,2.4092509253415928E-4,2.4076793474448396E-4,2.4087737889248655E-4,2.409480702966881E-4,2.408387568459235E-4,2.4078133312136916E-4,2.4073197870238752E-4,2.4079356239037114E-4,2.4073184904116224E-4,2.4074448225927736E-4,2.4073198551570252E-4,2.4088825421425382E-4,2.4081655816085955E-4,2.407564616226396E-4,2.407797833994224E-4]}}
{"value":"Chilly, alienating adaptation of Rebecca West's book about an Army Captain returning from duty in WWII with his memory impaired (now there's an original idea!). It seems he remembers old flame Glenda Jackson but not current wife Julie Christie, which should be enough to set off some emotional sparks. This extremely well-cast soaper brings together leading man Alan Bates with director Alan Bridges and co-stars Jackson, Christie, Ann-Margret, and Ian Holm, but the burners are all on low. There are a handful of good scenes (particularly whenever Jackson is on-screen), but Bridges' pacing is unrelievedly sluggish and the film's dulled-out color is enervating. Long on the shelf, this \"Soldier\" is best left forgotten. *1/2 from

{"value":"Why did I waste my money on this on the last day of Sundance? I want a refund... Can I have my $16 back? While I was watching this film I kept waiting for something to happen, nothing did happen. The only way I even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot, which was not really like the film. why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes? Why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading? Or was that the point? I felt like Phantom Love had no story at all, and to be honest I felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this

{"value":"Not long enough to be feature length and not abrupt enough to a short, this thing exists for one reason, to have a lesbian three-way. There are worse reasons to exist. One sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie. Misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character, like Lara Croft, that they make nude calenders of her, you know that a soft-core flick is set to explode. Unfortunately, this is pretty pathetic. Especially the painfully fake sex scene between Darian and Misty, where you can see her hand is fingering air. Watch this if you just can't get enough of Misty or Ruby, who makes a nice blonde and has zee verst jerman akcent

{"value":"Yes, this movie is a real thief. It stole some shiny Oscars from Avatar just because politicians wanted another war-hero movie to boost the acceptance (support?) for the wars U.S. is still fighting today. I do not really want to go here into politics, but come on, this is more clear than the summer sky. Hurt locker does not really have anything outstanding, no real plot at all. I really feel myself in the 50's of Hungary when the party told the people what to like and what not to like. The same propaganda movies were produced that time, only with the exception that those were black and white. Even if we consider this title a reasonable piece of the \"U.S. wars are cool\" genre, you surely have much better movies to choose from.","finished_norm":["ye","thi","movi","be","a","real","thief","it","steal","some","shini","oscar","from","avatar","just","becaus","politician","want","anoth","warhero","movi","to","boost","the","accept","support","for","the","war","u","be","still","fight","todai","i","do","not","realli","want","to","go","here","into","polit","but","come","on","thi","be","much","clear","than","the","summer","sky","hurt","locker","doe","not","realli","have","anyth","outstand","no","real","plot","at","all","i","realli","feel","myself","in","the","of","hungari","when","the","parti","tell","the","peopl","what","to","like","and","what","not","to","like","the","same","propaganda","movi","be","produc","that","time","onli","with","the","except","that","that","be","black","and","white","even","if","we","consid","thi","titl","a","reason","piec","of","the","u","war","be","cool","genr","you","sure","have","much","well","movi","to","choos","from"],"filtered":["ye","thi","movi","real","thief","steal","shini","oscar","avatar","becaus","politician","want","anoth","warhero","movi","boost","accept","support","war","u","still","fight","todai","realli","want","go","polit","come","thi","much","clear","summer","sky","hurt","locker","doe","realli","anyth","outstand","real","plot","realli","feel","hungari","parti","tell","peopl","like","like","propaganda","movi","produc","time","onli","except","black","white","even","consid","thi","titl","reason","piec","u","war","cool","genr","sure","much","well","movi","choos"],"filtered2":["ye","real","thief","steal","shini","oscar","avatar","becaus","politician","want","anoth","warhero","boost","accept","support","war","u","still","fight","todai","realli","want","go","polit","come","clear","summer","sky","hurt","locker","doe","realli","anyth","outstand","real","plot","realli","feel","hungari","parti","tell","peopl","like","like","propaganda","produc","time","onli","except","black","white","even","consid","titl","reason","piec","u","war","cool","genr","sure","well","choos"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,6,8,11,13,18,20,22,23,32,34,37,43,64,73,80,90,95,104,112,119,209,218,229,232,233,261,264,314,317,359,459,467,481,575,578,584,590,741,789,850,863,979,1383,1657,1758,2422,3240,3649,4709,6553,6601],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,6,8,11,13,18,20,22,23,32,34,37,43,64,73,80,90,95,104,112,119,209,218,229,232,233,261,264,314,317,359,459,467,481,575,578,584,590,741,789,850,863,979,1383,1657,1758,2422,3240,3649,4709,6553,6601],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,3.3953824709201923,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,2.975308642954861,1.6608112036218214,1.883428577602134,1.8950689206770979,3.9903607800925114,2.0477128419653545,2.0323326556775485,2.0728240170322856,4.493325799357863,2.1653408989309972,2.6026896854443837,2.5940874818617203,2.8432628718938773,2.6102777977348763,2.8377834061292515,2.7085302779237206,2.757740698455715,6.378794038853654,2.8529247828056143,3.2189558216683714,3.2850956241729166,3.342254038012865,3.353630724994973,3.6314455447135003,3.575630765607104,3.5146700658174166,3.4986697244709752,3.7165362186843414,3.8059428063999263,3.9241755834625858,3.944626193933877,4.096025840389245,4.573751515728891,4.798834931860927,5.00274712124725,5.116075806554253,5.626901430320244,5.850044981634453,6.1754673820690815,6.543192162194399,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875904E-4,2.0127954981638386E-4,2.0132924729208146E-4,2.0128877367343187E-4,2.0130782326822775E-4,2.0127844002166867E-4,2.013410404109268E-4,2.0124849307261728E-4,2.0127959235475908E-4,2.0148759300272522E-4,2.0308633840816418E-4,2.0127992481659617E-4,2.014705496249871E-4,2.014915393803378E-4,2.0140000703507247E-4,2.0128956652077786E-4,2.0135881791649224E-4,2.0145357806076913E-4,2.0129995823319903E-4,2.012992222605794E-4,2.0148032151161302E-4,2.0131939038753904E-4,2.013196950669895E-4,2.0144866261914555E-4,2.0130003084716273E-4,2.0149394770156283E-4,2.0135040540050425E-4,2.012790987071481E-4,2.0137035004885436E-4,2.0143181118237799E-4,2.0132037789173174E-4,2.0142820070206607E-4,2.01527096919992E-4,2.017141453144579E-4,2.0135005746134296E-4,2.0128944443546483E-4,2.0136202064780013E-4,2.0130988725827596E-4,2.0124870786807886E-4,2.0129989589387775E-4,2.0150163278967914E-4,2.0139109646015097E-4,2.0142865972223018E-4,2.0125872399380577E-4,2.0129994707934182E-4,2.0128936874294832E-4,2.0135750336924287E-4,2.013924190120031E-4,2.0135146700162235E-4,2.0131955243836503E-4,2.0128986651608998E-4,2.017022767636138E-4,2.0134051684480358E-4,2.0129990094164952E-4,2.0133943859176358E-4,2.0127930464302831E-4,0.9840914994019674,2.

{"value":"I have watched 3 episodes of Caveman, and I have no idea why I continue except maybe waiting for it to get better. <br /><br />To me this show is just pumping itself off the commercials, with no real humor. As we sat around watching these shows, we all speculated on what was going to happen.<br /><br />The episode of the woman cave-woman with a attitude was actually a big, yea right, for us. she's crude in a theater and acts tough to strangers, and truth be told, she needed a slap<br /><br />I consider myself a pretty good reviewer, taking in everything, but I must say, Cavemen is comparable to the old show, My mother, the car.

{"value":"It's the same old, \"If I can't get the funding for my project, I'll inject myself\" monster movie. There is nothing new here. It's a lot like the Jeff Goldblum \"Fly\" movie. The man manages to keep some semblance of sanity, but eventually succumbs to the effects of his experiments. The acting is pretty bad. There are people acting stupidly all along the way, putting their lives in danger for no apparent reason. The guy keeps going back to the lab he has been forbidden to enter. Then there's his relationship with a young woman and her son. Admittedly, he is good looking, but he seems like a lot of trouble. It's just a pretty big waste of time.

{"value":"OK, I am blessed. I have seen two very strong stage productions, the one in New York with the original cast, and another at the San Diego Rep (Rosina Reynolds and Monique Gaffney, you rock!). Compared to either of these the movie is almost unwatchable. I've been plodding through the DVD for the past two evenings and am still not finished. Way too much extraneous dialog, and waaay too many added scenes and people. Yes, the four major performances are quite good, esp. Ms. Streep's. But comparing stage to film is definitely an example of \"less is more.\" The thickening of the play to satisfy film-goers' need for scenic variety and specificity was a poor choice.

{"value":"3lbs is obviously just a self indulgent programme for Stanley Tucci to be a producer/moody deep doctor. Unlike House he has absolutely no personality and unlike Grey's Anatomy the brain surgery cases are't even interesting. This programme is supposed to be set in a leading centre for Neurlogical cases - yet there's nothing interesting or exciting going on! Not even the so called pathetic 'feud' between him and a rival adds anything to the show and neither do those hallucinations. In the pilot there was a brief glimpse into the leads's social life as a father - snooze! boring and pointless.<br /><br />This show is pants,there's a glut of medical dramas around at the moment and

{"value":"This movie contains no humor for anyone who has lived with a family member who has a mental illness. So many scenes reminded me too graphically of my own life experiences. This movie was the man's version of \"Mommy Dearest.\" It depicts both graphically and accurately the life many children of a mentally ill parent goes through. It also shows how easy it is for a psychiatrist to become corrupt and act like they are God. <br /><br />Someone told me it was funny. No way, I say! It is sick humor at best. <br /><br />The movie is so intense and depressing that my son and I had to leave the room. The best use for this movie is for people who don't understand mental illness or don't believe what we families actually do live through.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","contain","no","humor","for","anyon","who","have","live","with","a","famili","member","who","have","a","mental","ill","so","mani","scene","remind","me","too","graphic","of","my","own","life","experi","thi","movi","be","the","man","version","of","mommi","dear","it","depict","both","graphic","and","accur","the","life","mani","child","of","a","mental","ill","parent","go","through","it","conjur","show","how","easi","it","be","for","a","psychiatrist","to","becom","corrupt","and","act","like","thei","be","god","br","br","someon","tell","me","it","be","funni","no","wai","i","sai","it","be","sick","humor","at","well","br","br","the","movi","be","so","intens","and","depress","that","my","son","and","i","have","to","leav","the","room","the","well","us","for","thi","movi","be","for","peopl","who","do","not","understand","mental","ill","or","do","not","believ","what","we","famili","actual","do","live","through"],"filtered":["thi","movi","contain","humor","anyon","live","famili","member","mental","ill","mani","scene","remind","graphic","life","experi","thi","movi","man","version","mommi","dear","depict","graphic","accur","life","mani","child","mental","ill","parent","go","conjur","show","easi","psychiatrist","becom","corrupt","act","like","thei","god","br","br","someon","tell","funni","wai","sai","sick","humor","well","br","br","movi","intens","depress","son","leav","room","well","us","thi","movi","peopl","understand","mental","ill","believ","famili","actual","live"],"filtered2":["contain","humor","anyon","live","famili","member","mental","ill","mani","scene","remind","graphic","life","experi","man","version","mommi","dear","depict","graphic","accur","life","mani","child","mental","ill","parent","go","conjur","show","easi","psychiatrist","becom","corrupt","act","like","god","someon","tell","funni","wai","sick","humor","well","intens","depress","son","leav","room","well","us","peopl","understand","mental","ill","believ","famili","actual","live"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,19,20,21,23,28,33,39,45,50,52,56,62,74,75,90,91,115,116,139,158,180,182,212,220,333,352,369,434,513,618,644,670,711,744,778,911,1011,1075,1146,1350,1488,1601,1783,1983,4945,6031],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,19,20,21,23,28,33,39,45,50,52,56,62,74,75,90,91,115,116,139,158,180,182,212,220,333,352,369,434,513,618,644,670,711,744,778,911,1011,1075,1146,1350,1488,1601,1783,1983,4945,6031],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9708269144703846,1.312380678011735,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.5538940054862738,1.8162961064622165,3.43598877114071,1.7122153074726136,1.8610609350701788,2.0226120445069267,1.9486336368009016,3.948450049740535,2.0477128419653545,2.0105926690411424,2.201553588425805,4.493325799357863,2.2939035841256437,2.3106972614914807,2.7097314792693545,5.473059344848157,2.5983793339432615,2.8336934208777267,2.948928684455311,3.1236456418640466,6.243658221875298,3.4101163271295305,3.454678155189441,3.5642670069567886,3.5670958631572662,3.7264536553416874,3.6375061693251913,3.700222643192818,3.8059428063999263,11.909196345194859,4.086456389373095,4.202455303235976,8.595530966080602,4.470719289830655,13.629644375606428,4.613282354485526,4.869215728622727,4.944927550358424,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.048164689374513E-4,2.046349707097639E-4,2.046854966648001E-4,2.046443483326698E-4,2.0466371549280427E-4,2.0463384241427017E-4,2.0469748638025651E-4,2.0460339623606892E-4,2.0463501395727302E-4,2.048464820698706E-4,2.0647187928241813E-4,2.046353519613989E-4,2.0482915457133727E-4,2.048504942353782E-4,2.0475743600462674E-4,2.0464515439713873E-4,2.0471556024485922E-4,2.0481190008348786E-4,2.0465571934409366E-4,2.0465497110247848E-4,2.0483908935972137E-4,2.0467547544121247E-4,2.046757851998068E-4,2.0480690269923503E-4,2.046557931685649E-4,2.0485294270440447E-4,2.0470700748843478E-4,2.0463451208033368E-4,2.0472728462307E-4,2.047897703414148E-4,2.0467647940754553E-4,2.047860996727674E-4,2.048866445352586E-4,2.0507681111083843E-4,2.0470665374897073E-4,2.0464503027660844E-4,2.0471881636714278E-4,2.0466581389049767E-4,2.0460361461226774E-4,2.046556559655478E-4,2.0486075590640644E-4,2.0474837688640168E-4,2.047865663450047E-4,2.0461379771132882E-4,2.0465570800429664E-4,2.0464495332226353E-4,2.047142237835142E-4,2.0474972148578981E-4,2.0470808678692244E-4,2.046756401934988E-4,2.0464545939350803E-4,2.050647447058978E-4,2.046969540860498E-4,2.0465566109746818E-4,2.0469585785804525E-4,2.0463472144925793E-4,0.9838262975206153,2.0466664788313995E-4,2.0464574668954016E-4,2.0463460463854036E-4,2.0479831723105367E-4,2.0471610605268085E-4,2.0463451909590253E-4,2.0461371434704078E-4,2.045931

{"value":"I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just imposable. The acting was ultra hammy, the plot was annoying, and the pace was SLOW, sooo slowwwwww. The whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end. Twenty minuets into a films and I'm praying for an ending. Sure some of the visuals were nice, but c'mon guys, I mean really! And for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really wasn't much music to speak of. The music there was was annoying, and boring. There were sound loud shrill sounds at times too, those were also annoying. Mainly this film managed to bore me, and creep me out at the same time.<br /><br />I'm glad its over. I need to go see \"Tideland\" and wash this bad taste out of my mouth.","finished_norm":["i","realli","want","to","like","thi","movi","but","it","be","just","impos","the","act","be","ultra","hammi","the","plot","be","annoi","and","the","pace","be","slow","sooo","slowwwwww","the","whole","time","sit","in","the","theater","i","want","the","movi","to","end","twenti","minuet","into","a","film","and","i","be","prai","for","a","end","sure","some","of","the","visual","be","nice","but","c","mon","gui","i","mean","realli","and","for","a","movi","about","a","gui","tune","magic","instrum","there","realli","be","not","much","music","to","speak","of","the","music","there","be","be","annoi","and","bore","there","be","sound","loud","shrill","sound","at","time","too","that","be","conjur","annoi","mainli","thi","film","manag","to","bear","me","and","creep","me","out","at","the","same","timebr","br","i","be","glad","it","over","i","ne","to","go","see","tideland","and","wash","thi","bad","tast","out","of","my","mouth"],"filtered":["realli","want","like","thi","movi","impos","act","ultra","hammi","plot","annoi","pace","slow","sooo","slowwwwww","whole","time","sit","theater","want","movi","end","twenti","minuet","film","prai","end","sure","visual","nice","c","mon","gui","mean","realli","movi","gui","tune","magic","instrum","realli","much","music","speak","music","annoi","bore","sound","loud","shrill","sound","time","conjur","annoi","mainli","thi","film","manag","bear","creep","timebr","br","glad","ne","go","see","tideland","wash","thi","bad","tast","mouth"],"filtered2":["realli","want","like","impos","act","ultra","hammi","plot","annoi","pace","slow","sooo","slowwwwww","whole","time","sit","theater","want","end","twenti","minuet","prai","end","sure","visual","nice","c","mon","gui","mean","realli","gui","tune","magic","instrum","realli","music","speak","music","annoi","bore","sound","loud","shrill","sound","time","conjur","annoi","mainli","manag","bear","creep","timebr","glad","ne","go","see","tideland","wash","bad","tast","mouth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,8,9,13,21,24,32,37,39,55,88,108,110,111,118,119,178,244,262,271,344,345,390,424,525,546,635,872,941,957,1022,1115,1210,1227,1250,1389,1574,2200,2488,2671,3323,4049,4315,4832,4959,5144,7751],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,8,9,13,21,24,32,37,39,55,88,108,110,111,118,119,178,244,262,271,344,345,390,424,525,546,635,872,941,957,1022,1115,1210,1227,1250,1389,1574,2200,2488,2671,3323,4049,4315,4832,4959,5144,7751],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,3.3953824709201923,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,1.3711311285073675,2.975308642954861,1.5538940054862738,3.9073995778510735,2.0317223413467334,2.138507503627933,2.1290479736304078,2.1183455303375887,4.70875905096179,2.1653408989309972,5.065666512090782,2.634508058031767,2.726701583487816,8.273222095367146,2.983093497946387,3.0022328381570844,3.132778125427319,3.212973749990824,3.4149707055943286,3.4572130107926293,3.587125145032839,3.857614816944247,3.9612932464190886,3.969732115064953,4.165705761027235,4.2078172463773615,4.274508620876034,4.246178114249808,4.280272325592784,4.449957298382227,4.573751515728891,5.129498826886393,5.170884043049248,5.259176650194926,5.583416318380505,5.822646007446338,6.032366538428407,6.0662680901040895,6.137727054086234,6.214688095222362,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0481646893745115E-4,2.0463497070976377E-4,2.0468549666479994E-4,2.0464434833266968E-4,2.046637154928041E-4,2.0463384241427E-4,2.0469748638025638E-4,2.0460339623606876E-4,2.0463501395727286E-4,2.0484648206987044E-4,2.06471879282418E-4,2.0463535196139877E-4,2.0482915457133713E-4,2.0485049423537807E-4,2.0475743600462657E-4,2.0464515439713856E-4,2.0471556024485908E-4,2.048119000834877E-4,2.0465571934409353E-4,2.0465497110247835E-4,2.048390893597212E-4,2.046754754412123E-4,2.0467578519980665E-4,2.048069026992349E-4,2.0465579316856477E-4,2.0485294270440434E-4,2.0470700748843464E-4,2.0463451208033352E-4,2.0472728462306986E-4,2.0478977034141466E-4,2.0467647940754536E-4,2.0478609967276723E-4,2.0488664453525843E-4,2.050768111108383E-4,2.047066537489706E-4,2.046450302766083E-4,2.0471881636714262E-4,2.046658138904975E-4,2.0460361461226758E-4,2.0465565596554765E-4,2.048607559064063E-4,2.0474837688640155E-4,2.0478656634500457E-4,2.046137977113287E-4,2.0465570800429648E-4,2.046449533222634E-4,2.0471422378351404E-4,2.0474972148578968E-4,2.0470808678692227E-4,2.0467564019349866E-4,2.0464545939350787E-4,2.0506474470589767E-4,2.0469695408604967E-4,2.0465566109746804E-4,2.046958578580451E-4,2.0463472144925776E-4,0.9838262975206155,2.046666478831398E-4,2.0464574668954E-4,2.046346046385402E-4,2.0479831723105353E-4,2.047161060526807E-4,2.0463451909590236E-4,2.0461371434704

{"value":"While this outing certainly doesn't live up to its predecessor, it does have more than its share of memorable moments. My personal favorite, just after laying waste to a city block with his \"Videodisc Cannon,\" we see a close up of Nimoy's face. As a single tear sheds from his left eye, we know at that point that Nimoy is more than just a killing machine. The viewer can't help but be pulled into his emotional turmoil and we understand that his previously flat affect was only a facade. Absolute brilliance!!! The sex scenes display a nice balance, carnal, but not pornographic. Afterwards, I felt I had a pretty good understanding of how to work the Magnavision Videodisc Player.

{"value":"Fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-cast and strangely attractive. She resembles a deranged Renee Zellweger with a bad hair-do. This chick only made two of these films and then moved back to Texas. The music is terrible. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name.<br /><br />Best line in the film from Tony - \"Are you putting me on, doll? None of my chicks put me on\". Good B/W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good locales (cool swimming pool, also used in THE DEFILERS). Strange ending but fitting. A 4 out of 10.

{"value":"This wasn't really a very good movie. There were lots of implausible and predictable things that happened during the course of the film...but I think that most of the reviewers are missing the point of why this movie should be enjoyed by a wide audience. THIS MOVIE WAS PRODUCED BY MAGIC JOHNSON! Isn't that enough to inspire us all to check out this film? A film produced by a former NBA star doesn't come along every day, you know. Beautifully stupid kids in a big house getting slashed by an axe wielding psycho. Every cliché trotted out for us to groan over. Teen sex. And it was all produced by MAGIC JOHNSON!

{"value":"The minute the forward started, I knew we were in for trouble! The premise is laughable at best. The story line was even worse, if that is possible.<br /><br />The acting was stiff and the actors gave off a sense of inexperience. You expect more from the likes of Slater, Reid and Dorff. Lines were delivered as if from a robot. And I'm sorry, I like Reid but she was VERY unbelievable as an archaeologist. Slater and Dorff picked a lousy film to try and stage their comebacks. <br /><br />The continuity was off through out the entire film. The creatures weren't bad, but they really weren't good either. <br /><br />Bottom line, I want that ninety minutes of my life back. They can keep the money, but give me the time!

waste.","finished_norm":["the","minut","the","forward","start","i","know","we","be","in","for","troubl","the","premis","be","laughabl","at","well","the","stori","line","be","even","wrong","if","that","be","possiblebr","br","the","act","be","stiff","and","the","actor","give","off","a","sens","of","inexperi","you","expect","much","from","the","like","of","slater","reid","and","dorff","line","be","deliv","a","if","from","a","robot","and","i","be","sorri","i","like","reid","but","she","be","veri","unbeliev","a","a","archaeologist","slater","and","dorff","pick","a","lousi","film","to","try","and","stage","their","comeback","br","br","the","continu","be","off","through","out","the","entir","film","the","creatur","be","not","bad","but","thei","realli","be","not","good","either","br","br","bottom","line","i","want","that","nineti","minut","of","my","life","back","thei","can","keep","the","monei","but","give","me","the","time","what","a","wast"],"filtered":["minut","forward","start","know","troubl","premis","laughabl","well","stori","line","even","wrong","possiblebr","br","act","stiff","actor","give","sens","inexperi","expect","much","like","slater","reid","dorff","line","deliv","robot","sorri","like","reid","veri","unbeliev","archaeologist","slater","dorff","pick","lousi","film","try","stage","comeback","br","br","continu","entir","film","creatur","bad","thei","realli","good","either","br","br","bottom","line","want","nineti","minut","life","back","thei","keep","monei","give","time","wast"],"filtered2":["minut","forward","start","know","troubl","premis","laughabl","well","stori","line","even","wrong","possiblebr","act","stiff","actor","give","sens","inexperi","expect","like","slater","reid","dorff","line","deliv","robot","sorri","like","reid","veri","unbeliev","archaeologist","slater","dorff","pick","lousi","try","stage","comeback","continu","entir","creatur","bad","realli","good","either","bottom","line","want","nineti","minut","life","back","keep","monei","give","time","wast"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,8,9,13,15,17,20,21,25,26,30,36,37,41,59,63,71,75,89,107,126,130,134,173,198,207,433,437,446,484,517,552,571,669,699,752,761,860,1116,1154,2136,3250,3353,3364,4936,5621,6057,6075],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,8,9,13,15,17,20,21,25,26,30,36,37,41,59,63,71,75,89,107,126,130,134,173,198,207,433,437,446,484,517,552,571,669,699,752,761,860,1116,1154,2136,3250,3353,3364,4936,5621,6057,6075],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,2.6728839783437044,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,3.7386508898401445,1.8729627573220065,1.9214926742550966,1.9742250248702675,1.9940046109572438,6.431860195918187,2.2391270689902285,2.2642139034199635,2.2443961816702407,2.4368824319140248,2.5439726117360975,2.5531798379045583,3.164467636384302,3.1952392950510555,3.233054746047873,3.291526514503207,3.4198487640477615,3.424750734647968,3.467417180966871,3.7099788181381825,3.5813614403160887,3.719831114581194,3.9405024767500145,3.8538340941043407,4.224077767249142,4.589376833631972,4.9676558014359795,12.685042933464494,5.583416318380505,12.511020179485236,6.137727054086234,6.2980697041614135,6.543192162194399,13.451027437976705]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852448E-4,2.0810416094933751E-4,2.0815554347424273E-4,2.081136975517069E-4,2.0813339304459247E-4,2.0810301352577537E-4,2.08167736452141E-4,2.0807205119149444E-4,2.0810420493002453E-4,2.083192580755696E-4,2.0997221075493515E-4,2.0810454866435678E-4,2.0830163682280365E-4,2.0832333825958533E-4,2.0822870240647188E-4,2.0811451728144025E-4,2.0818611672416984E-4,2.0828408981847656E-4,2.081252613366421E-4,2.0812450041003718E-4,2.0831174003631457E-4,2.081453523601865E-4,2.0814566737013885E-4,2.0827900771323686E-4,2.081253364126645E-4,2.0832582823766948E-4,2.081774189722981E-4,2.0810369454473212E-4,2.0819803986654254E-4,2.0826158490941748E-4,2.0814637334682745E-4,2.0825785201168085E-4,2.0836010141789878E-4,2.0855349190005535E-4,2.0817705923586544E-4,2.081143910566864E-4,2.0818942804771057E-4,2.0813552701656125E-4,2.0807227326983947E-4,2.0812519688363554E-4,2.0833377389740354E-4,2.0821948970841433E-4,2.082583265954436E-4,2.0808262900365478E-4,2.0812524980460073E-4,2.0811431279772936E-4,2.081847576057069E-4,2.0822085710288512E-4,2.0817851656820463E-4,2.0814551990552932E-4,2.0811482744843325E-4,2.0854122093255095E-4,2.0816719513391528E-4,2.081252021025577E-4,2.081660803214846E-4,2.081039074631016E-4,0.9835521036690726,2.0813637514793614E-4,2.0811511961501408E-4,2.081037886720842E-4,2.0827027669504362E-4,2.08186671

It's full of lame, crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developer's (Dangerfield) plans to build a ski resort in Utah that just didn't capture my attention at all.<br /><br />In addition to Dangerfield the film starred a weak cast, including the likes of Andrew Dice Clay and the totally over the hill John Byner (I didn't even know he was still around until I saw his name in the credits for this.)<br /><br />This truly is a Dangerfield disaster.<br /><br

{"value":"If you can believe it, *another* group of teens return to *another* lakeside cabin three years after *another* one of those fatal 'accidents' claimed one of their number. Low and behold, a psycho wearing a patterned hockey mask (a cheap papery one at that) turns up to waste them one by one. This mechanical 'Friday the 13th' knock off gained slight notoriety as one of the first digitally-shot features, but that's where the interesting facts end and all that remains is a predictable, amateur production with sub-par performances and a recurring boom-mic intrusion. A last-second twist does little to lift the spirits, and 'Memorial Day' is something best tossed in a lake and forgotten about.

{"value":"I just finished watching this movie and I found it was basically just not funny at all.<br /><br />I'm an RPG Gamer (computer type, none of the DnD tabletop stuff) but I found none of the jokes in this funny at all.<br /><br />Some of the scenes seemed to drag out a lot (tilt and zoom could've been cut down to 5seconds rather than over a minute) and it feels as though the director was just trying to fill in time.<br /><br />I think I laughed a total of 2-3 times in the entire movie.<br /><br />The acting itself wasn't all that bad, around the standard that a B Grade movie should

{"value":"I saw this movie on a westbound American Airlines flight. It was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer. The plot had potential (who wouldn't love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every Elvis impersonator she meets?) but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing. Towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of Elvis impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking he's going to return, then a group of stars moves together to form an \"Elvis\" constellation, which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators, sending them crashing through the roof. Bad...REALLY bad. Which is the theme for the whole movie. I'd avoid this one at all costs.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","movi","on","a","westbound","american","airlin","flight","it","be","so","bad","it","actual","make","the","flight","seem","long","the","plot","have","potenti","who","would","not","love","a","movi","about","a","woman","who","accident","kill","everi","elvi","imperson","she","meet","but","it","get","screw","up","a","million","differ","time","by","realli","poor","write","toward","the","end","be","a","embarrassingli","bad","scene","where","a","gang","of","elvi","imperson","be","on","the","roof","of","a","casino","reship","the","sky","think","he","go","to","return","then","a","group","of","star","move","togeth","to","form","a","elvi","constel","which","promptli","shoot","a","bolt","of","lightn","at","the","imperson","send","them","crash","through","the","roof","badreal","bad","which","be","the","theme","for","the","whole","movi","i","have","avoid","thi","on","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","westbound","american","airlin","flight","bad","actual","make","flight","seem","long","plot","potenti","love","movi","woman","accident","kill","everi","elvi","imperson","meet","get","screw","million","differ","time","realli","poor","write","toward","end","embarrassingli","bad","scene","gang","elvi","imperson","roof","casino","reship","sky","think","go","return","group","star","move","togeth","form","elvi","constel","promptli","shoot","bolt","lightn","imperson","send","crash","roof","badreal","bad","theme","whole","movi","avoid","thi","cost"],"filtered2":["see","westbound","american","airlin","flight","bad","actual","make","flight","seem","long","plot","potenti","love","woman","accident","kill","everi","elvi","imperson","meet","get","screw","million","differ","time","realli","poor","write","toward","end","embarrassingli","bad","scene","gang","elvi","imperson","roof","casino","reship","sky","think","go","return","group","star","move","togeth","form","elvi","constel","promptli","shoot","bolt","lightn","imperson","send","crash","roof","badreal","bad","theme","whole","avoid","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,8,9,12,13,19,24,32,35,52,54,65,70,76,85,99,100,111,117,146,204,223,270,275,335,350,410,488,534,547,563,689,721,807,836,997,1183,1623,1705,1758,1848,2131,2987,3404,3417,4439,4775,4793,5222,5499],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,8,9,12,13,19,24,32,35,52,54,65,70,76,85,99,100,111,117,146,204,223,270,275,335,350,410,488,534,547,563,689,721,807,836,997,1183,1623,1705,1758,1848,2131,2987,3404,3417,4439,4775,4793,5222,5499],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,3.205071257016622,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.7122153074726136,1.8113893252729412,1.9073850067444174,2.094675786251684,2.1337665533324026,2.011190219103739,2.056430207256609,2.1405462403177813,2.1183455303375887,2.2797301185117202,2.326138445979858,2.624524614047584,2.825563294794476,2.731603554088023,2.7832848715031413,2.908534262247101,3.0135689919434205,3.2070272508030975,3.3933092088131493,3.4933926673701317,3.432149042129413,3.459754308221302,3.607563812710113,3.6841709341823097,3.900174431363043,3.7881170224473255,4.263079925052412,4.315570107673808,4.613282354485526,4.751432692966343,5.00274712124725,17.63464757580345,10.457742601399195,16.50521486209871,5.5623629091826725,5.604922523601468,6.0662680901040895,6.214688095222362,12.275454108172468,6.389041482367141,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079207E-4,1.9803239209117206E-4,1.980812878185436E-4,1.9804146714364108E-4,1.9806020941939256E-4,1.9803130020030492E-4,1.9809289068399759E-4,1.9800183637269856E-4,1.9803243394329368E-4,1.9823707900490487E-4,1.9981003252786668E-4,1.9803276104166475E-4,1.982203105807611E-4,1.9824096171727892E-4,1.9815090602457122E-4,1.9804224720031664E-4,1.981103813925954E-4,1.9820361281160033E-4,1.9805247126764271E-4,1.9805174716815764E-4,1.9822992482167894E-4,1.9807158993126727E-4,1.9807188969545318E-4,1.9819877666871452E-4,1.980525427101561E-4,1.982433311860777E-4,1.981021045921647E-4,1.9803194825949053E-4,1.9812172748195054E-4,1.9818219708903892E-4,1.9807256150447308E-4,1.9817864485507664E-4,1.9827594562220628E-4,1.9845997644414863E-4,1.9810176226615854E-4,1.9804212708455425E-4,1.9811353245559562E-4,1.9806224011196353E-4,1.9800204770295594E-4,1.980524099340153E-4,1.9825089229392242E-4,1.9814213920018084E-4,1.9817909647006288E-4,1.9801190224276883E-4,1.9805246029372595E-4,1.9804205261315304E-4,1.9810908805238003E-4,1.9814344041586414E-4,1.9810314906692163E-4,1.980717493677959E-4,1.9804254235593146E-4,1.9844829936360836E-4,1.9809237556434487E-4,1.9805241490035352E-4,1.9809131470630446E-

to ache. the bit where the old men when to capture Robert Duvall was ludicrous. on a directorial level making a noir film does not involve lots of raining sequences and pointless closeups on the main character. this is a failed attempt to create a noir thriller and instead alienates the viewer with incoherent scenes. seeing as this was based on a 'manuscript' by john Grisham i do not count this as one of his book to film adaptations as it displays none of the suspense and engaging storyline as films such as 'the firm' or 'the rainmaker'.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","much","pointless","film","i","have","ever","see","a","there","be","no","plot","and","the","actor","do","not","seem","to","care","of","the","film","have","absolut","no","plot","whatsoev","i","laugh","so","much","my","rib","begin","to","ach","the","bite","where","the","old","man","when","to","captur","robert","duval","be","ludicr","on","a","directori","level","make","a","noir","film","doe","not","involv","lot","of","rain","sequenc","and","pointless","closeup","on","the","main","charact","thi","be","a","fail","attempt","to","creat","a","noir","thriller","and","instead","alien","the","viewer","with","incoher","scene","see","a","thi","be","base","on","a","manuscript","by","john","grisham","i","do","not","count","thi","a","on","of","hi","book","to","film","adapt","a","it","displai","none","of","the","suspens","and","engag","storylin","a","film","such","a","the","firm","or","the","rainmak"],"filtered":["thi","much","pointless","film","ever","see","plot","actor","seem","care","film","absolut","plot","whatsoev","laugh","much","rib","begin","ach","bite","old","man","captur","robert","duval","ludicr","directori","level","make","noir","film","doe","involv","lot","rain","sequenc","pointless","closeup","main","charact","thi","fail","attempt","creat","noir","thriller","instead","alien","viewer","incoher","scene","see","thi","base","manuscript","john","grisham","count","thi","hi","book","film","adapt","displai","none","suspens","engag","storylin","film","firm","rainmak"],"filtered2":["pointless","ever","see","plot","actor","seem","care","absolut","plot","whatsoev","laugh","rib","begin","ach","bite","old","man","captur","robert","duval","ludicr","directori","level","make","noir","doe","involv","lot","rain","sequenc","pointless","closeup","main","charact","fail","attempt","creat","noir","thriller","instead","alien","viewer","incoher","scene","see","base","manuscript","john","grisham","count","book","adapt","displai","none","suspens","engag","storylin","firm","rainmak"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,10,18,19,32,35,41,44,45,67,72,133,147,151,152,154,177,179,205,215,222,241,279,291,334,349,362,370,445,515,529,531,539,565,701,714,885,925,943,991,1063,1394,1538,1948,2061,2539,3116,3550,3768,6592],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,10,18,19,32,35,41,44,45,67,72,133,147,151,152,154,177,179,205,215,222,241,279,291,334,349,362,370,445,515,529,531,539,565,701,714,885,925,943,991,1063,1394,1538,1948,2061,2539,3116,3550,3768,6592],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,1.1238870241028365,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,2.742262257014735,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,1.9570915389266579,1.9209463754160525,2.3212364753796515,2.2844323215331563,2.8002454868101863,2.3131195476980753,2.348499626138016,2.458149992634611,2.507968722980095,2.571852579609833,2.605934685587711,2.5771019354959765,2.6627744961815836,2.7910771187233068,3.016831637578237,2.942840385588056,3.0568369721919364,3.058539100262467,2.9958122703541616,3.241201430615691,3.3956930001684253,3.4648563601051974,6.854421520977661,3.6105180246075443,3.9081109809587793,3.8240921249056035,3.7297814454343623,3.9323057095458362,3.969732115064953,3.9911462095687695,4.004218291136122,4.100845126825194,4.403125998698128,4.550761997504193,4.911775343041523,5.0768550934009715,10.852461469716184,5.482320201509136,5.907203395474402,5.967828017290836,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.194497759780537E-4,2.1925531043720615E-4,2.193094462670605E-4,2.1926535805328207E-4,2.1928610891855615E-4,2.1925410152956982E-4,2.1932229259911867E-4,2.1922148009526665E-4,2.1925535677457458E-4,2.19481933427208E-4,2.2122345868647725E-4,2.192557189277261E-4,2.1946336794909422E-4,2.1948623224568876E-4,2.1938652538130784E-4,2.192662217077921E-4,2.193416577681341E-4,2.1944488069798197E-4,2.1927754147741077E-4,2.1927673977696315E-4,2.1947401253786478E-4,2.1929870906764123E-4,2.1929904095723237E-4,2.1943952627086755E-4,2.1927762057634143E-4,2.1948885564790875E-4,2.1933249395190844E-4,2.1925481904056093E-4,2.1935421980567526E-4,2.1942116987548035E-4,2.1929978476330192E-4,2.1941723695242712E-4,2.1952496533805894E-4,2.1972871854514237E-4,2.1933211493919258E-4,2.1926608871935272E-4,2.1934514652716502E-4,2.192883572382646E-4,2.1922171407356029E-4,2.1927747357072453E-4,2.1949722707154427E-4,2.1937681902578203E-4,2.1941773696650542E-4,2.1923262471379987E-4,2.1927752932743115E-4,2.1926600626693158E-4,2.193402258220397E-4,2.1937825969134978E-4,2.1933365036190102E-4,2.1929888559081107E-4,2.192665484949165E-4,2.19715790044447E-4,2.193217222746471E-4,2.1927747906929984E-4,2.1932054772559218E-4,2.192550433680467E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630287E-4,2

{"value":"I do have the `guts' to inform you to please stay away from `Dahmer', the biographical film based on the real-life story of the grotesque serial killer. `Dahmer' strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject. Jeffrey Dahmer, who murdered over 15 young males and ate some of their body parts, was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation. However, the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful `dahm' project. This is not an easy film to digest, even though Jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery `brainsadillas' appetizers or even some real-life `Mr. Potato skins'. *

{"value":"No doubt Frank Sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer. After all, very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take, and that was pretty much Sinatra's modus operandi on set.<br /><br />I feel that as the 1960's wore on, the quality of the man's films really started to tank. The Tony Rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with Dean Martin's Matt Helm series which came out at the same time. Perhaps even a James Bond competition, but nothing really worked for Frank during these years. His personal life in shambles, his music fading out...Sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 1950's.

{"value":"A dog found in a local kennel is mated with Satan and has a litter of puppies, one of which is given to a family who has just lost their previous dog to a hit & run. The puppy wants no time in making like Donald Trump and firing the Mexican housekeeper, how festive. Only the father suspects that this canine is more then he appears, the rest of the family loves the demonic pooch. So it's up to dad to say the day.<br /><br />This late 70's made for TV horror flick has little going for it except a misplaced feeling of nostalgia.
