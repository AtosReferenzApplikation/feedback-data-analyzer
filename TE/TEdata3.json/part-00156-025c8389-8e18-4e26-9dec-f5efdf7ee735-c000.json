{"value":"This movie kinda let me down. It seemed a lot like the movie Jaws when the Hopper was telling the Mayor to close parks was like when Roy Shider was telling the Mayor to close the beaches. They both said no way its summer! But the box says Hopper has to get into the mind of a killer and think like one. But he really doesn't do anything too interesting or exciting. I'm not even a little convinced he and his partner have any experience doing police work when they are in the office wondering how they are gonna solve this case. They just say lets do police work and we'll solve it. And whats up with all the old men with pool cues. I didn't even begin to believe that they were mob bosses. And then the guy who was doubting the guy the mob picked to handle finding the killer. With his hundred dollar haircut and that he thinks his Di@k is the size of a schoolbus. Come on what cruddy lines. I thought he was gonna hit him with a baseball bat like in the other movies. I got this movie used and wouldn't buy it new. I suggest you skip this movie. Oh and it was funny seeing the microphone above the scene where hopper is going out to get coffee.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","kinda","let","me","down","it","seem","a","lot","like","the","movi","jaw","when","the","hopper","be","tell","the","mayor","to","close","park","be","like","when","roi","shider","be","tell","the","mayor","to","close","the","beach","thei","both","sai","no","wai","it","summer","but","the","box","sai","hopper","have","to","get","into","the","mind","of","a","killer","and","think","like","on","but","he","realli","doe","not","do","anyth","too","interest","or","excit","i","be","not","even","a","littl","convinc","he","and","hi","partner","have","ani","experi","do","polic","work","when","thei","be","in","the","offic","wonder","how","thei","be","gonna","solv","thi","case","thei","just","sai","let","do","polic","work","and","we","will","solv","it","and","what","up","with","all","the","old","man","with","pool","cue","i","do","not","even","begin","to","believ","that","thei","be","mob","boss","and","then","the","gui","who","be","doubt","the","gui","the","mob","pick","to","handl","find","the","killer","with","hi","hundr","dollar","haircut","and","that","he","think","hi","dik","be","the","size","of","a","schoolbu","come","on","what","cruddi","line","i","think","he","be","gonna","hit","him","with","a","basebal","bat","like","in","the","other","movi","i","get","thi","movi","us","and","would","not","bui","it","new","i","suggest","you","skip","thi","movi","oh","and","it","be","funni","see","the","microphon","abov","the","scene","where","hopper","be","go","out","to","get","coffe"],"filtered":["thi","movi","kinda","let","seem","lot","like","movi","jaw","hopper","tell","mayor","close","park","like","roi","shider","tell","mayor","close","beach","thei","sai","wai","summer","box","sai","hopper","get","mind","killer","think","like","realli","doe","anyth","interest","excit","even","littl","convinc","hi","partner","ani","experi","polic","work","thei","offic","wonder","thei","gonna","solv","thi","case","thei","sai","let","polic","work","solv","old","man","pool","cue","even","begin","believ","thei","mob","boss","gui","doubt","gui","mob","pick","handl","find","killer","hi","hundr","dollar","haircut","think","hi","dik","size","schoolbu","come","cruddi","line","think","gonna","hit","basebal","bat","like","movi","get","thi","movi","us","bui","new","suggest","skip","thi","movi","oh","funni","see","microphon","abov","scene","hopper","go","get","coffe"],"filtered2":["kinda","let","seem","lot","like","jaw","hopper","tell","mayor","close","park","like","roi","shider","tell","mayor","close","beach","wai","summer","box","hopper","get","mind","killer","think","like","realli","doe","anyth","interest","excit","even","littl","convinc","partner","ani","experi","polic","work","offic","wonder","gonna","solv","case","let","polic","work","solv","old","man","pool","cue","even","begin","believ","mob","boss","gui","doubt","gui","mob","pick","handl","find","killer","hundr","dollar","haircut","think","dik","size","schoolbu","come","cruddi","line","think","gonna","hit","basebal","bat","like","get","us","bui","new","suggest","skip","oh","funni","see","microphon","abov","scene","hopper","go","get","coffe"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,12,13,14,18,19,27,33,34,35,38,45,48,55,56,60,62,67,72,87,90,91,104,107,124,147,175,234,238,252,288,295,333,347,388,446,471,478,524,567,587,646,654,704,931,935,945,1038,1251,1328,1351,1383,1397,1474,1514,1798,1872,2093,2191,2343,2376,2558,2589,2840,2955,4002,4378,4978,5944],"values":[4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,12,13,14,18,19,27,33,34,35,38,45,48,55,56,60,62,67,72,87,90,91,104,107,124,147,175,234,238,252,288,295,333,347,388,446,471,478,524,567,587,646,654,704,931,935,945,1038,1251,1328,1351,1383,1397,1474,1514,1798,1872,2093,2191,2343,2376,2558,2589,2840,2955,4002,4378,4978,5944],"values":[2.5841531782306313,0.6557002054693947,2.389902141215977,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,3.200185830788664,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.3002700588679295,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.8162961064622165,3.3910232448024944,3.9073995778510735,1.8610609350701788,1.838176641236591,2.0226120445069267,1.9570915389266579,1.9209463754160525,2.115024371522662,4.095425683930709,2.0105926690411424,2.0728240170322856,2.1439533986393955,4.464786073617769,2.2844323215331563,2.3791142619576227,2.673149229007135,2.597304642813496,6.0866465060504265,2.8015621426949333,5.5821542374466135,2.948928684455311,3.0151989841543516,3.0914425013694116,3.233054746047873,6.992055430016274,3.3243163373261977,3.4028786598293,3.454678155189441,3.6105180246075443,3.5900195030592035,3.634471265630037,3.5900195030

{"value":"Storyline: The film spanning 4-odd hours covers in adequate details the happenings at the Kargil sector near the LOC in 1999 when the Pakistani infiltrators had crossed the LOC and had entered deep into the Indian territory and the Indian Retaliation. To know more about the story, I would suggest readers to read the news-items pertaining to Kargil.<br /><br />Comment: If one is looking for a formula story in this movie, then one can be sure that it is absent. LOC is a story of Pure sacrifice, patriotism, courage and lots and lots of bullets and Blood. The movie hall where I saw this film was full of whistles and cheers when the Film shows Indian Bravery. Movie audience seemed similar to Audiences like in an India vs Pak cricket match.<br /><br />Watch the movie as a tribute to the Army's sacrifice and for the characterization of the real-life war heroes (4 PVC honoured heroes) who have sacrificed their lives so that we could see this day. The movie has made a brilliant portrayal of the Army who have battled all odds in rough weather conditions. The film's negatives are that it is too stretched and the songs are extremely boring.","finished_norm":["storylin","the","film","span","odd","hour","cover","in","adequ","detail","the","happen","at","the","kargil","sector","near","the","loc","in","when","the","pakistani","infiltr","have","cross","the","loc","and","have","enter","deep","into","the","indian","territori","and","the","indian","retali","to","know","much","about","the","stori","i","would","suggest","reader","to","read","the","newsitem","pertain","to","kargilbr","br","comment","if","on","be","look","for","a","formula","stori","in","thi","movi","then","on","can","be","sure","that","it","be","absent","loc","be","a","stori","of","pure","sacrific","patriot","courag","and","lot","and","lot","of","bullet","and","blood","the","movi","hall","where","i","see","thi","film","be","full","of","whistl","and","cheer","when","the","film","show","indian","braveri","movi","audienc","seem","similar","to","audienc","like","in","a","india","v","pak","cricket","matchbr","br","watch","the","movi","a","a","tribut","to","the","armi","sacrific","and","for","the","character","of","the","reallif","war","hero","pvc","honour","hero","who","have","sacrific","their","live","so","that","we","can","see","thi","dai","the","movi","have","make","a","brilliant","portray","of","the","armi","who","have","battl","all","odd","in","rough","weather","condit","the","film","neg","be","that","it","be","too","stretch","and","the","song","be","extrem","bore"],"filtered":["storylin","film","span","odd","hour","cover","adequ","detail","happen","kargil","sector","near","loc","pakistani","infiltr","cross","loc","enter","deep","indian","territori","indian","retali","know","much","stori","suggest","reader","read","newsitem","pertain","kargilbr","br","comment","look","formula","stori","thi","movi","sure","absent","loc","stori","pure","sacrific","patriot","courag","lot","lot","bullet","blood","movi","hall","see","thi","film","full","whistl","cheer","film","show","indian","braveri","movi","audienc","seem","similar","audienc","like","india","v","pak","cricket","matchbr","br","watch","movi","tribut","armi","sacrific","character","reallif","war","hero","pvc","honour","hero","sacrific","live","see","thi","dai","movi","make","brilliant","portray","armi","battl","odd","rough","weather","condit","film","neg","stretch","song","extrem","bore"],"filtered2":["storylin","span","odd","hour","cover","adequ","detail","happen","kargil","sector","near","loc","pakistani","infiltr","cross","loc","enter","deep","indian","territori","indian","retali","know","stori","suggest","reader","read","newsitem","pertain","kargilbr","comment","look","formula","stori","sure","absent","loc","stori","pure","sacrific","patriot","courag","lot","lot","bullet","blood","hall","see","full","whistl","cheer","show","indian","braveri","audienc","seem","similar","audienc","like","india","v","pak","cricket","matchbr","watch","tribut","armi","sacrific","character","reallif","war","hero","pvc","honour","hero","sacrific","live","see","dai","make","brilliant","portray","armi","battl","odd","rough","weather","condit","neg","stretch","song","extrem","bore"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,16,17,26,28,35,72,94,108,116,119,132,145,168,174,280,314,328,329,336,354,375,491,515,555,589,646,726,740,772,786,834,912,982,1025,1147,1170,1176,1220,1254,1417,1422,1525,1976,1986,2037,2183,2410,2474,2644,2858,2886,2991,3060,3183,3268,3434,4148,4579,5682,6355,7444,7470,8258],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,7,16,17,26,28,35,72,94,108,116,119,132,145,168,174,280,314,328,329,336,354,375,491,515,555,589,646,726,740,772,786,834,912,982,1025,1147,1170,1176,1220,1254,1417,1422,1525,1976,1986,2037,2183,2410,2474,2644,2858,2886,2991,3060,3183,3268,3434,4148,4579,5682,6355,7444,7470,8258],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,1.1966138720291084,3.83116108203179,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.463169012899134,3.841892750832105,2.08112281984698,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,2.1653408989309972,2.253494045787767,2.34599021453259,4.978953423722071,2.456282578459816,2.8028805344481915,3.189397019426827,3.1550424959247185,2.951986790814132,2.9233055795674137,3.185521045582134,6.519555632377253,3.369778711402955,3.3956930001684253,3.432149042129413,3.530930586689197,3.5900195030592035,3.6466665387238555,3.7165362186843414,7.611885612799853,3.900174431363043,3.8240921249056035,3.9405024767500145,8.310898521720091,13.309054938979344,4.246178114249808,4.2860694432771105,4.358390104856736,4.30366520516749,4.3095999406873045,4.733083554298147,4.484804029712395,4.6295428753573065,4.900964426937307,14.801262749280895,4.944927550358424,5.02684467282631,5.089758498236879,5.1994574154933035,5.243909

{"value":"This 30 minute documentary Buñuel made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his weakest films. First, let's admit that 70 years later, Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth it's a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). And if poverty receded in Spain it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people, the horror!. Buñuel shortsightedness is at its most glaring here, not realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology what will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school?

{"value":"The plot was very thin, although the idea of naked, sexy, man eating sirens is a good one.<br /><br />The film just seemed to meander from one meaningless scene to another with far too few nuddie/splatter/lesbian mouth licking shots in between.<br /><br />The characters were wooden and one dimensional.<br /><br />The ending made no sense.<br /><br />Considering it had Tom Savini and Shaun Hutson in it, you would have expected a decent plot and decent special effects. Some of the effects were quite good but there were just too few of them.<br /><br />Brownie points go for occasional flashes of tits and bush, naturally, and of course the lesbian moments. I also thought that the scene with the sirens bathing in the pool under the waterfall could be viewed as an innovative take on the 'shower scene'<br /><br />The film had many of the elements that go into making a first rate horror film but they were poorly executed or used too sparsely.<br /><br />If I had been watching this alone and aged 15, i would have really enjoyed it for about 10 minutes

{"value":"The thing that really gets me about this movie (that is, the thing about this movie that makes me physically ill) is that someone actually paid to have it made. There is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie. It is not frightening, it is not thought provoking, it is not entertaining, it is not good. It is a sleeping pill made of cyanide. The DVD case compares it to Blair Witch, Evil Dead, and a few other decent movies, making the filmmaker's desperation glaringly obvious. It is nothing like any other movie ever made; it is far, far worse. The claims of an \"extremely shocking ending you will never forget\" are the equivalent of one ton of stinking horse droppings. Please do not ever waste your time watching this piece of trash, because it may make you sterile. The man who wrote this movie should be wiped off the Writer's Guild membership list, and never allowed to film anything again. Because if he thought THIS was a movie worth making, he probably does not have much of anything to offer in the future. Zero stars. May Grod have mercy on the soul of anyone unfortunate enough to see this.

{"value":"Start of with the good bit: several times Swayze talks Zulu to his friends or that language is heard among the tribes. That's a great plus, as normally USA & UK movie audiences think all people on this planet speak English (just in case you're one of them: no they don't).<br /><br />But the acting is 'tenenkrommend' as we say in The Netherlands (it makes your toes curl -and not in a good way). I like Swayze but in this he's awful. The muscles in his jaws make overtime and he's frowning the whole movie -some one must have told him it looks butch. No Patrick: it looks silly and is compensation for lack of character. Alison Doody (Elizabeth) has opted for a style of acting that does not meet the style of her co-workers. Her acting is só relaxed that this movie could have been set in the current days. And it's not. Your frock was a clue, Alison.<br /><br />The best acting came from the people from the African Continent and Sided Onyulo as Umbopa I liked best.

{"value":"No words can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the BTK killer. Rating this film one out of ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a film. From start to finish, there was not one single highlight. The entire thing was horrendously put together; the script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, ACTING, factual information, ACTING, just to name a few. A number of scenes are literally laugh-out-loud-funny, for the atrocious way in which the entire thing is put together. This review may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a low-budget film, but this is not the case. Just thinking about the movie I have just seen makes my blood start to boil. How this film was ever granted rights for production i will NEVER know. I am almost tempted to actually recommend BTK, because it is truly a stand-out in regards to how pathetic, and disturbingly awful it is. I can honestly say, in all my years of film-going, this is the WORST. MOVIE. EVER. I wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage, and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand, had I known what I was in for.

{"value":"Swedish action movies have over the past few years evolved into something that imitate American hardened action movies like \"Heat\" but with a low budget. This movie follows the same prescription as \"Noll Tolerans\" and \"Livvakterna\". However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and tough movie.<br /><br />The story has been seen before, the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor, especially from the main actress. The movie tries to paint a picture of hard-boiled military-like robbers with no remorse at all and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts completely rational. It does not succeed very well.<br /><br />The bluish-cast photo style does not seem fresh anymore, and it is not even done well in this picture. Only a very few scenes actually look good. Also, the sound is quite weird and it sounds like a lot of the actual dialogue is recorded afterward.<br /><br />The main quality of this movie is Stefan Sauk, though not making a convincing portrait of a SWAT-team leader, has some really funny lines.

{"value":"Alright, so I've been dying to see this movie. Stoked about the, \"who's who\" in horror land that are in the film....well, my friend rented this, brought it over, and we started watching it. It's supposed to be a comedy....I did not smirk even ONCE, until the 40min mark.<br /><br />Does it have to do with the budget? Not at all, in fact, there's films out there that cost CLOSE TO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, and they're amazing (to me anyways). Also, while watching this film, I couldn't help but realize the similarities (i.e., STEALING) to a low budget indie film titled, \"ACTRESS APOCALYPSE\", read my review about it (it DESTROYS this film BTW).<br /><br />This film...it had potential it really did. It had the \"star power\", stolen plot (lets film the behind the scenes of the making of a movie...IE...\"ACTRESS APOCALYPSE\"....seriously, this angers me the more and more I think about),...it really could've been funny. A LOT, A LOT of the jokes fall flat. The acting is alright for what it is. But it dragged on, wasn't funny, and the plot was totally stolen.<br /><br />I give this a two, because it wasn't SOOO AWFUL, but that's the ONLY

{"value":"Warner Bros. made many potboilers in the 1930s and most of them are fast paced, economical and very entertaining. I really love how the studio exploited the less glamorous elements of our daily life. This is one of Warner's few hard-edged melodramas that simply doesn't work. Edward G. Robinson plays a ruthless editor of newspaper who resurrects the 20-year old story of a murderess with tragic consequences. Robinson gives a lively performance but he is surrounded by actors that don't cut the mustard. H.B. Warner, Aline MacMahon and Boris Karloff are good, but the bad acting of Frances Starr and Anthony Bushell in the second leads really hurts the movie. Starr is particularly bad during her big dramatic scene near the end of the movie. In addition, the moralistic tone of the film seems ridiculous in the context of pre-code Hollywood. LeRoy's direction is full of innovative visual touches but he cannot overcome the bad acting and the unintentionally funny situations. Sol Polito's camera work is strong.

{"value":"This movie is not based on the bible. It completely leaves Christ out of the movie. They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Christ. Let alone talk about it. It does not quote from scriptures. The end times are called the great tribulation. The movie does not even show bad times. The seven bowls, seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing it's structure. The anti-Christ was killed 3 1/2 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended. The only part they got correct was there was two prophets. The did not use there names of course because that would be too close to the truth of scriptures. The worst part of it was I really wanted it to be a good movie. I wanted to take unsaved people to it. I feel that the movie is evil. It is a counterfeit just like everything the devil does. I just hope it does not take away from the upcoming movie based on the left behind books.<br /><br />The second problem with the movie is it was just bad.

{"value":"As gently as I can, I sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time. I did not find it the 'warm, emotionally satisfying' film others did. I found it boring, with music that distracted from the film. The story was thin, the characters overdrawn, and the direction pedestrian.<br /><br />Fooey.<br /><br />Now I'm going to write some more about this movie, so I make the 10 line minimum. There really isn't more to be said and brevity is important, but IMDb has its minimums, so here goes.<br /><br />Young eager kid finds nascent talent, seeks time with aging, embittered mentor in spite of father's cartoonish homophobia. Aging, embittered mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little. conflict arises. While I don't think this is a spoiler, I've added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much. <br /><br />Mostly, I just found the film boring and pretentious. A waste of my time. I honestly don't understand what little fuss there seems to be, mostly on this web site, about the transcendent quality of this movie. I think it's really worth avoiding.

{"value":"In 1972, after his wife left to go her own way, Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson. Miss Thompson, a good-humored, long haired, lovely, statuesque beauty queen, is charted to fill a void in Elvis' life. When Elvis' divorce became final, Linda was already in place as the legendary performer's live-in girlfriend and travel companion until 1976.<br /><br />This is a gaudy look at their love affair and companionship. Linda whole-heartedly tending to her lover's needs and desires. And even putting up with his swallowing medications by the handful and introducing her to her own love affair with valium. At times this movie is harsh and dark of heart; a very unattractive look at the 'King' and his queen.<br /><br />Don Johnson is absolutely awful as Elvis. Over acting to the hilt is not attractive. Stephanie Zimbalist lacks the classiness of Linda, but does the job pretty well. Supporting cast includes: John Crawford, Ruta Lee, and Rick Lenz. Watching this twice is more than enough for me, but don't let this review stop you from checking it out.

{"value":"This is a movie which attempts a retelling of Thai history, set in the ancient city of Ayutthaya. I decided to watch this film because I thought it was along the lines of many Thai films I've watched and enjoyed, one that has Thai actors speaking Thai and martial arts craziness. Well, it's none of that. This film is shot entirely in English, is chock full of Anglo actors, and has production values so terrible it is laughably bad....but not funny! Who can we blame for this rubbish? The acting, dialog, and most of the sets were quite bad. Some of the fight scenes looked like they were choreographed by the local high school drama club. The special effects were also mostly bad, but a few were just cheap animation patched onto the screen that provided an especially cheesy effect. It has one large, epic-style outdoor battle scene, where a few thousand extras get to run across a field in costume, but when we see the two armies collide in combat--HA! What a joke! The film does feature a couple of beauties. What a pity they didn't show a little more skin. At least that would have been something for the guys to appreciate.

{"value":"Frank Sinatra was far from the ideal actor for westerns. He was a great actor, From Here to Eternity and The Man with The Golden arm are a proof of that, but he did not have the physique of a western hero, you identified him as an urban guy. But he tried to do his job well in Johnny Concho, the fact that the film was a failure at the box office was not his fault. I blame it on two factors: a) the story was too unusual, specially in the fact that Sinatra behaves more like a villain than as a hero throughout the movie. In a genre where people kind of expected a certain pattern, to break away from it the film has to be very good. b) the story is not convincing, it is hard to believe that a whole town will allow Sinatra to do anything he wants just because they are afraid of his brother. Also when a man shows him a special holster that will open sideways so he has not to draw the gun you wonder that if that will make him invincible, why all the gunfighters have not adopted it?

{"value":"This is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron. The acting is second rate. Poor Mathew Modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film. And god help Gina Gershon. Her accent is too over the top. It sounds nothing like an true English woman. It sounds forced and phony, much like her acting. She should stick to what she does best, lesbian showgirl con-artist who plays in a rock & roll band and has a drug problem. The other characters are no better. They are two dimensional. empty, vapid and silly. How are we to supposed to care about these people. At one point Christy Scott Cashman get's lost in Central Park. Really? It's not that hard to navigate Central Park. Just follow any path out. Not only did I not care about ANY of the characters,I downright hated them. The only reason I even stayed with this train-wreck of a film was Fisher Stevens. Even his brilliant humor couldn't save this dying Fish. Each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us. The script was awful as was the acting.

{"value":"Sometimes I rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and/or crocodiles are still getting made these days. They've been making these lame \"Jaws\"-copies since the 70s, it's not like they're getting any more well-liked. The idea is still exactly the same. So we have an animal that starts murdering people. First it takes down some secondary characters, then it starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous, who usually plays a specialist. One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow, usually with an explosion. Then, we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc. etc. \"Krocodylus\" basically uses the same overused ideas, and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation. Unless you count the fact that the \"specialist\" is a captain in this one variation, in that case your standards are pretty low. It's funny that he's played by Duncan Regehr though, he like totally used to be Zorro.Hell I'll give it a bonus point for

{"value":"I see people writing about how great this movie was. It was horrible! The acting was sub-par at best. It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank, what was running through a lot of people's minds; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No, you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?).<br /><br />I did cry in during one scene, though. The scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship. It looked like pool water! I'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn't even make the water from the ocean look real? unbelievable...<br /><br />Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank.. Just ridiculous.

{"value":"This movie is a pathetic attempt, apparently, to justify the actions of Mary Ann Letourneau. In order to do this, they cast a 19-year-old -well, probably not \"in order to do this.\" There was no way they could have cast a 12 or 13 year old as the boy because the love scenes would have grossed everyone out (if they had even been allowed to do them) - as they should. Mary Ann's boyfriend was my nephew's age, making her a pedophile. Sixth grade, people. The definition of pedophile doesn't have to include many children - all you need is one.<br /><br />I really don't care about her upbringing or her unhappy marriage. She had a responsibility to her students that she did not live up to. The reason given is that she is bipolar, rejected the diagnosis, and refused to take her medication. It's understandable, then, that she was not thinking rationally.

{"value":"This was in short a terrible disappointment. By far the worst adaptation of one of my favourite novels. The dialogue was horribly clumsy; I could sense no feeling behind the words expressed by the characters. The lines were delivered too hastily and felt rather out of place. They could just as well have been cited by statues. The chemistry between George C. Scott and Susannah York was non-existent and watching an American Rochester felt strange. He could have at least tried to do a British accent. I like George C. Scott as an actor, but this simply did not work. I felt like I was watching highlights from Jane Eyre, where the main pieces of the story had been randomly put together with no regard to the flow of the story. The scenery and music were all very nice, but I could feel none of the passion and love that is supposed to be between Jane and Rochester and the movie left me totally unmoved.<br /><br />If you want to see a good version of Jane Eyre I suggest you watch the 1983 BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke or the 1997 version with Ciarán Hinds and Samantha Morton.

{"value":"This quasi J-horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of Shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends. She finds that one, the daughter of the village priestess, drowned several years earlier. She and Fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that Sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. Already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. Nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. Unlike stellar J-horror films, the suspense doesn't really build, the result doesn't seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd.<br /><br />This movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy. Sometimes you get this at poor Asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long. You end up eating it, because you need it with the meal, because what is Chinese or Japanese food without rice, but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey, gooey tastelessness of it all. 3/10

{"value":"Because 'cruel' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers. Where do you even begin? In a spout of b*tchiness, I'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie. Scratch that. Nearly does not belong in that sentence. I can't think of even one character who was portrayed well. Although, in all fairness, it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way. Still, the girl who played Katherine (whose name I purposefully don't include - I'm pretending she doesn't exist) remains one of the worst actors I've ever seen, only eclipsed by the guy who played Sebastian. The story was God awful. It attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways. Pretty much every part of it was pointless - though I will admit (grudgingly) that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise. And the ending was at least slightly humorous. But this film is up there with the worst I've seen. Don't watch it. Just don't. There is absolutely no value in watching it. None.

{"value":"I watched this movie, and hoped for something to get better the entire time. What is so great about a guy with no emotion? *yawn*<br /><br />You never see Alex show emotion for anyone other than his son. Yeah, I know that this is why his son is the only one to cause him to lose his temper (if you can call it that), I get it.<br /><br />Characters are undeveloped, relationships aren't given enough time to be understood. In one scene Sarah says they won't fall in love, and the next time we see her she's talking about how his death really shook her up because they were so close? Logic synapses abound in this film.<br /><br />It's like someone watched Boogie Nights and wrote this part to mimic Little Bill. Even the scene where he \"loses his temper\" is the same as when Little Bill shoots his wife, down to the facial expression (or lack thereof). Yes, William H. Macy is good at portraying a man without emotion - been there, done that - can you say Magnolia?<br /><br />This movie didn't only lack emotion, it lacked substance, a good script, developed characters, and a plot.

{"value":"The only reason I remember this movie is because it was (and still is) the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. I was 17 and my friend was 18. We were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most (ok 2nd most). We walked out feeling so insulted, we wanted our money back, but the time could never be regained.<br /><br />The editing is what killed this movie. As the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in 4x4 VW Bugs shooting rockets at the truck. Please, rockets at a truck known to be carrying plutonium? What's worse is the these VW's manage to get 15-18 shots off of a 4 rocket launcher. You would see on VW with 4 rockets fire 2 of them, cut around the truck with the last one attached, come back a second later with two rockets attached, fire another, then go in front of the truck and now it's back to a full set of 4 rockets.<br /><br />We toughed it out hoping for a big finish that never happened.

{"value":"I read a couple of good reviews on this board for \"Mr. Scarface\", but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster films like myself, the picture will probably make very little sense. Indeed, after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam, the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of Rick's (Al Cliver) character. The whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli (Vittorio Caprioli), but as most other viewers commented, he's about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence. I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari's goons who chased Tony through the streets didn't actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them. For all of his buildup as the title character, Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale, making the U.S. working title, \"Mr. Scarface\", rather moot. I've seen enough spaghetti Westerns to know that they don't all work; I guess in this case, my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didn't quite make it

{"value":"I remembered this show from when i was a kid. i couldn't remember too much about it, just a few minor things about the characters. for some reason i remembered it being really intense. also it was on really really early in the morning up in PA. I finally, after looking around the web for a long time, found an episode. the first episode no-less. Criminey! This show was so horrible. it was obviously just made to show kids playing lazer tag and having a great time. the show opens with bhodi li telling his mommy \"my names not Christopher, I'm bhodi li-PHOTON WARRIOR!!!!!\" we then are forced to watch kids playing lazer tag to the song \"foot loose\". and not just a quick little bit, but the whole song. ahhhhhhhhh my brain hurts just thinking about it. oh yeah, and as if i couldn't get worse, you cant even see the laser beams from their guns. its like they're just running around to the entire \"foot loose\" song. later on, after bhodi goes up into space or where-ever, they have a crappy laser gun fight to the Phil Collins song \"su-su-sudio.\" ah, trust me, you don't want to know the rest. what can i say......THE LIGHT

{"value":"The director states in the Behind-the-Scenes feature that he loves horror movies. He loves them so much that he dedicated the movie to Dario Argento, as well as other notable directors such as George A. Romero and Tobe Hooper. Basically dedicating this movie to those great directors is like giving your mother a piece of sh*t for Mother's Day. The first thing they did wrong was the casting. CAST PEOPLE THAT CAN ACT. Also, don't cast a person that is 40 years old for the role of a misunderstood, 18 year old recluse. That's right, he's been in high school for 22 years. The reactions made by people as they watch their boyfriends get their hearts ripped out is amusing. Or like one part when a guy gets stabbed in the ear with an ear of corn (haha get it), and his girlfriend just goes, \"Oh..my.. God?\" The scarecrow himself is quite a character. Doing flips off cars and calling people losers.<br /><br />The movie does have one redeeming factor... oh wait, no it doesn't.<br /><br />If you absolutely MUST see this movie, than just watch the Rock and Roll trailer on the DVD.

{"value":"As a long-time fan of Superman from the comics, through the 1950s series, the first two of the Chris Reeves films and Lois & Clark, and finally Smallville, I was *really* hoping for something clever with \"Superman Returns\".<br /><br />Instead we got Lex Luthor making *another* attempt at real-estate conversion, another Superman-beaten-up-while-wearing-kryptonite sequence, and internal inconsistencies: he couldn't stop himself falling into the ocean when stuck with 6\" of kryptonite, but when Lois breaks off 3\" of it, *leaving the rest embedded in him*, he can lift *a continent* into space?? Really, the only hero in the story was Lois' partner - I can't remember his name off-hand. He did all kinds of life-saving, heroic things with nothing but guts and skill - no superpowers, no invulnerability...just a normal human.<br /><br />They keep making Superman so small. Why can't we have Superman battling Brainiac or fighting to save the universe from General Zod instead of Lex's petty schemes.

{"value":"This movie is one long chiche after another. First of all, though they did their share, there is a unwarranted dope scene where John sniffs weed like an idiot. The wigs and accents are terrible. They sound worse then the old Beatle cartoons. John is the nasty, envious, closet homosexual, slave to Yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited Albert Goldman book. They even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation \"it was always just the Two Of Us\"! John would not have been mean to his fans like this either. Like his death showed us he was too nice if anything. The one funny scene is where a dumb Beatle fan only recognizes John and asks him to sing Paul's Yesterday. An insulted John says something along the lines of \"Sure and while I croon why don't you get down on your knees, put on your wife's wig, and lick my liggin\". That made me laugh for days. Really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous. John and Paul also did not sit pontificating all day, they were funny light hearted guys who even during The Beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here.

{"value":"Joe Don Baker is an alright to good actor in small roles here and there...he was alright in Goldeneye and made a pretty good Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he can't do is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this extremely bad revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite bad and you won't find yourself exactly pulling for Joe Don's character. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets taken out by one punch and how incompetent he proves to be. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the worst closing lines to end a movie ever.","finished_norm":["joe","don","baker","be","a","alright","to","good","actor","in","small","role","here","and","thereh","be","alright","in","goldeney","and","make","a","pretti","good","bond","villan","in","the","live","daylight","and","have","appear","in","variou","other","movi","on","thing","he","ca","not","do","be","carri","a","movi","a","the","lead","which","he","be","in","thi","extrem","bad","reveng","movi","set","in","malta","joe","don","partner","be","kill","so","he","kill","the","killer","brother","and","escort","the","killer","to","itali","but","some","gui","caus","the","plane","to","set","down","in","malta","and","the","killer","get","awai","the","rest","of","the","movi","be","see","joe","don","chase","the","killer","here","and","there","joe","don","get","take","into","custodi","variou","time","joe","don","tortur","a","bartendar","and","be","interrupt","and","so","on","the","movi","be","quit","bad","and","you","wo","not","find","yourself","exactli","pull","for","joe","don","charact","you","will","be","amaz","at","how","mani","time","joe","don","the","hero","get","take","out","by","on","punch","and","how","incompet","he","prove","to","be","the","crown","part","of","the","movi","come","when","joe","don","chase","the","killer","all","over","malta","with","the","killer","in","a","priest","robe","and","then","thei","get","in","boat","and","he","chase","them","all","around","malta","thi","movi","conjur","featur","on","of","the","wrong","close","line","to","end","a","movi","ever"],"filtered":["joe","baker","alright","good","actor","small","role","thereh","alright","goldeney","make","pretti","good","bond","villan","live","daylight","appear","variou","movi","thing","ca","carri","movi","lead","thi","extrem","bad","reveng","movi","set","malta","joe","partner","kill","kill","killer","brother","escort","killer","itali","gui","caus","plane","set","malta","killer","get","awai","rest","movi","see","joe","chase","killer","joe","get","take","custodi","variou","time","joe","tortur","bartendar","interrupt","movi","quit","bad","wo","find","exactli","pull","joe","charact","amaz","mani","time","joe","hero","get","take","punch","incompet","prove","crown","part","movi","come","joe","chase","killer","malta","killer","priest","robe","thei","get","boat","chase","around","malta","thi","movi","conjur","featur","wrong","close","line","end","movi","ever"],"filtered2":["joe","baker","alright","good","actor","small","role","thereh","alright","goldeney","make","pretti","good","bond","villan","live","daylight","appear","variou","thing","ca","carri","lead","extrem","bad","reveng","set","malta","joe","partner","kill","kill","killer","brother","escort","killer","itali","gui","caus","plane","set","malta","killer","get","awai","rest","see","joe","chase","killer","joe","get","take","custodi","variou","time","joe","tortur","bartendar","interrupt","quit","bad","wo","find","exactli","pull","joe","charact","amaz","mani","time","joe","hero","get","take","punch","incompet","prove","crown","part","come","joe","chase","killer","malta","killer","priest","robe","get","boat","chase","around","malta","conjur","featur","wrong","close","line","end","ever"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,8,9,10,24,25,29,31,34,38,39,41,44,50,55,61,76,78,81,98,107,109,116,120,128,155,157,170,226,252,295,305,329,363,375,381,406,452,462,530,540,544,621,685,802,821,871,942,1088,1252,1449,1514,1542,1551,1900,2033,2553,3819,3940,3950,4069,4790,5027,6341,7630],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,8,9,10,24,25,29,31,34,38,39,41,44,50,55,61,76,78,81,98,107,109,116,120,128,155,157,170,226,252,295,305,329,363,375,381,406,452,462,530,540,544,621,685,802,821,871,942,1088,1252,1449,1514,1542,1551,1900,2033,2553,3819,3940,3950,4069,4790,5027,6341,7630],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,3.1865361882879695,1.8837873718108231,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,2.814133962290301,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.717994385570355,1.9536997889255368,1.8818517047392527,4.267533106664805,2.0064197866819473,1.949757232424728,2.0881990796736947,2.1439533986393955,4.251382278653714,2.2466628996789315,2.2044500422972613,2.3409902041158843,2.3074766467914385,2.3360150694757706,2.4214486257841834,2.5940874818617203,18.259939518151278,2.7910771187233068,2.8612813773965557,2.951986790814132,3.0349689855553557,3.2597778161886266,3.24941502915308,3.121829110937649,3.2872346624216657,3.2639531875991072,10.735475993664407,3.432149042129413,3.4222967456864013,3.5446859617576822,3.607563812710113,3.8883864756110005,34.71850975427041,3.99

{"value":"I found a DVD of \"I Dream Of Jeanie\" in the $1.00 bin at Wal-Mart. When I saw that it was the \"story of Stephen Foster\", being a musician and music educator, I had to see it. I had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover, just that it was a remake of 1939's \"Sewanee River\". Bill Shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes laughable. The man has NO testosterone and is a wimp all the way through! I have a difficult time believing Stephen Foster thought music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs...without paying him for them! In addition to that ridiculous notion, there is a nearly 20 minute segment of Ray Middleton and his black-faced \"Christy Minstrels\" performing Stephen Foster's songs that was difficult to watch, to say the least. I can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to resurrect in our current time. It is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten. Fortunately, Stephen Foster's songs will NEVER be forgotten....also, Eileen Christy's portrayal of Jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of Hollywood history.","finished_norm":["i","find","a","dvd","of","i","dream","of","jeani","in","the","bin","at","walmart","when","i","see","that","it","be","the","stori","of","stephen","foster","be","a","musician","and","music","educ","i","have","to","see","it","i","have","no","idea","what","year","it","be","make","for","it","do","not","sai","on","the","cover","just","that","it","be","a","remak","of","sewane","river","bill","shirlei","portray","of","the","compos","be","sometim","pain","sometim","laughabl","the","man","have","no","testosteron","and","be","a","wimp","all","the","wai","through","i","have","a","difficult","time","believ","stephen","foster","think","music","publish","be","do","him","a","favor","by","publish","hi","songswithout","pai","him","for","them","in","addit","to","that","ridicul","notion","there","be","a","nearli","minut","segment","of","rai","middleton","and","hi","blackfac","christi","minstrel","perform","stephen","foster","song","that","be","difficult","to","watch","to","sai","the","littl","i","can","hardli","believ","anyon","would","consid","thi","movi","appropri","to","resurrect","in","our","current","time","it","be","a","embarrass","and","should","remain","forget","fortun","stephen","foster","song","will","never","be","forgottenalso","eileen","christi","portray","of","jeani","be","certainli","the","high","point","in","thi","low","point","of","hollywood","histori"],"filtered":["find","dvd","dream","jeani","bin","walmart","see","stori","stephen","foster","musician","music","educ","see","idea","year","make","sai","cover","remak","sewane","river","bill","shirlei","portray","compos","sometim","pain","sometim","laughabl","man","testosteron","wimp","wai","difficult","time","believ","stephen","foster","think","music","publish","favor","publish","hi","songswithout","pai","addit","ridicul","notion","nearli","minut","segment","rai","middleton","hi","blackfac","christi","minstrel","perform","stephen","foster","song","difficult","watch","sai","littl","hardli","believ","anyon","consid","thi","movi","appropri","resurrect","current","time","embarrass","remain","forget","fortun","stephen","foster","song","never","forgottenalso","eileen","christi","portray","jeani","certainli","high","point","thi","low","point","hollywood","histori"],"filtered2":["find","dvd","dream","jeani","bin","walmart","see","stori","stephen","foster","musician","music","educ","see","idea","year","make","cover","remak","sewane","river","bill","shirlei","portray","compos","sometim","pain","sometim","laughabl","man","testosteron","wimp","wai","difficult","time","believ","stephen","foster","think","music","publish","favor","publish","songswithout","pai","addit","ridicul","notion","nearli","minut","segment","rai","middleton","blackfac","christi","minstrel","perform","stephen","foster","song","difficult","watch","littl","hardli","believ","anyon","consid","appropri","resurrect","current","time","embarrass","remain","forget","fortun","stephen","foster","song","never","forgottenalso","eileen","christi","portray","jeani","certainli","high","point","low","point","hollywood","histori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,12,14,17,33,38,42,45,57,59,66,91,105,118,123,158,211,217,247,274,300,317,322,328,372,389,458,483,491,499,500,552,556,607,611,665,682,722,803,1110,1185,1347,1360,1422,1463,1465,1531,1665,1719,1748,1944,2194,2260,2587,2639,2926,3382,3818,4396,5294,6726],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,12,14,17,33,38,42,45,57,59,66,91,105,118,123,158,211,217,247,274,300,317,322,328,372,389,458,483,491,499,500,552,556,607,611,665,682,722,803,1110,1185,1347,1360,1422,1463,1465,1531,1665,1719,1748,1944,2194,2260,2587,2639,2926,3382,3818,4396,5294,6726],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,1.6219954307453837,1.8162961064622165,1.834162586674748,1.8693254449200722,3.859446346783224,4.021185338082285,2.1765612129984904,4.70875905096179,2.2619070973220485,2.3106972614914807,2.5687161421197025,2.6113665294700725,2.7303758068497004,2.748952192422636,2.932274249550174,2.8529247828056143,2.885344817328191,6.310084991849437,3.0316467233633775,3.0914425013694116,3.2829611516442836,3.613480989738201,3.369778711402955,3.3814747511661465,6.762949502332293,3.424750734647968,3.43462735814388,3.68099128126493,3.520060914452293,3.5929222627171646,3.6497387377608255,3.850067611308864,7.527365994220087,4.1554492608600455,4.235066888824737,18.264117878539924,4.403125998698128,8.96960805942479,4.724033718778229,4.506310234933358,4.869215728622727,4.77960356993304,4.74221603786142,4.706176101378222,4.900964426937307,21.929280806036545,5.0
