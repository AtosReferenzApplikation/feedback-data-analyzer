{"value":"Oh my, where to start... this movie was just awful. The writing was bad, acting was bad, special effects were bad. I think the only good thing about this movie is that it made me laugh! I was in the mood for a scary movie but certainly didn't get that! I thought it would be decent enough since i'm not picky. i've watched several bad horror movies. In fact, it is my goal to see all horror movies, not matter how awful they may be. At one point in the movie i made a comment about the \"corn syrup blood\" and in the special features they actually admit that it was Karo syrup (brand name corn syrup...) The movie had all the necessary things for a horror movie (blood, nudity, crazy killer, stupid moves) but it was just completely lacking anything to really make it good. The writer should either take some classes or just give up!","finished_norm":["oh","my","where","to","start","thi","movi","be","just","aw","the","write","be","bad","act","be","bad","special","effect","be","bad","i","think","the","onli","good","thing","about","thi","movi","be","that","it","make","me","laugh","i","be","in","the","mood","for","a","scari","movi","but","certainli","do","not","get","that","i","think","it","would","be","decent","enough","sinc","i","be","not","picki","i","have","watch","sever","bad","horror","movi","in","fact","it","be","my","goal","to","see","all","horror","movi","not","matt","how","aw","thei","mai","be","at","on","point","in","the","movi","i","make","a","comment","about","the","corn","syrup","blood","and","in","the","special","featur","thei","actual","admit","that","it","be","karo","syrup","brand","name","corn","syrup","the","movi","have","all","the","necessari","thing","for","a","horror","movi","blood","nuditi","crazi","killer","stupid","move","but","it","be","just","complet","lack","anyth","to","realli","make","it","good","the","writer","should","either","take","some","class","or","just","give","up"],"filtered":["oh","start","thi","movi","aw","write","bad","act","bad","special","effect","bad","think","onli","good","thing","thi","movi","make","laugh","mood","scari","movi","certainli","get","think","decent","enough","sinc","picki","watch","sever","bad","horror","movi","fact","goal","see","horror","movi","matt","aw","thei","mai","point","movi","make","comment","corn","syrup","blood","special","featur","thei","actual","admit","karo","syrup","brand","name","corn","syrup","movi","necessari","thing","horror","movi","blood","nuditi","crazi","killer","stupid","move","complet","lack","anyth","realli","make","good","writer","either","take","class","give"],"filtered2":["oh","start","aw","write","bad","act","bad","special","effect","bad","think","onli","good","thing","make","laugh","mood","scari","certainli","get","think","decent","enough","sinc","picki","watch","sever","bad","horror","fact","goal","see","horror","matt","aw","mai","point","make","comment","corn","syrup","blood","special","featur","actual","admit","karo","syrup","brand","name","corn","syrup","necessari","thing","horror","blood","nuditi","crazi","killer","stupid","move","complet","lack","anyth","realli","make","good","writer","either","take","class","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,9,11,12,13,21,29,30,31,46,52,65,66,71,83,93,97,103,104,106,133,136,138,143,162,183,203,207,234,252,275,280,287,305,309,316,355,389,396,408,612,628,691,712,1129,1769,2236,2551,4283,6726],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,9,11,12,13,21,29,30,31,46,52,65,66,71,83,93,97,103,104,106,133,136,138,143,162,183,203,207,234,252,275,280,287,305,309,316,355,389,396,408,612,628,691,712,1129,1769,2236,2551,4283,6726],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,4.273428342688829,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.162015545335049,2.6390769554676132,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.655771293751733,1.7122153074726136,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,1.9214926742550966,6.876956393220216,2.035389827120098,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.159084361316692,2.3212364753796515,2.346825985579986,4.581473037857885,2.3409902041158843,2.3586007221245198,2.4885128563647294,5.139521057275218,2.5531798379045583,2.673149229007135,3.0433232530252132,2.7832848715031413,2.8028805344481915,2.841890188081905,2.8612813773965557,2.848772527704847,2.878207028279898,6.371042091164268,3.0914425013694116,3.291526514503207,3.130944944345658,3.5929222627171646,3.607563812710113,3.5929222627171646,3.7165362186843414,4.197121957260614,4.724033718778229,5.051537285416681,5.185068678041204,12.132536180208179,20.383519771425913]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.980728187257627E-5,6.933655505129922E-5,6.987558065101026E-5,6.947183880159924E-5,6.947297701946144E-5,6.937586768094175E-5,6.95822012318835E-5,6.934653906216799E-5,6.950245536179157E-5,7.71091802343601E-5,0.7707208006544322,6.92345984588986E-5,7.052682790589915E-5,7.153290860326188E-5,6.928508360584645E-5,6.90936095284587E-5,7.081706318913216E-5,6.958872055891044E-5,6.93728218244631E-5,6.943031955947788E-5,7.010209862291699E-5,6.965766537173151E-5,6.973698119127283E-5,6.981211496686842E-5,7.034788708348181E-5,6.997998743848105E-5,7.292181316795864E-5,6.92551812702109E-5,6.925703400849705E-5,6.943249631250795E-5,7.0908267767307E-5,6.958468848679044E-5,7.469326845185051E-5,6.978041994712852E-5,6.933056242053625E-5,6.965056866928432E-5,6.926109146443277E-5,6.930201967362511E-5,6.909326239657797E-5,0.13145566727256322,6.926674926226197E-5,6.999736669497576E-5,6.964168065969086E-5,6.936633692193013E-

{"value":"My wife and I thought that with this cast and director, the movie would have to be at least worth watching. We were wrong. In fact, we gave up on it after 45 minutes. The idea that Crawford, Young and Tone are British but speak with American accents was, for me, impossible to get past -- hard to believe this is England when no one talks with a British accent. There is zero chemistry between Crawford and anyone, and to echo a previous comment, the idea that Cooper and Crawford suddenly declare their love for one another without any reason is ludicrous. There is no reason to care about any of the characters, which is why we threw in the towel halfway through. I found it hard to believe that Hawks directed this, as none of the actors spoke with the trademark Hawksian rat-a-tat delivery.

{"value":"In keeping with Disney's well-known practice of stealing.. I mean.. buying out known properties and bastardizing them, this live-action version of the venerable cartoon classic has got to be one of the worst re-makes in a year of bad re-makes. I grew up on the original cartoon TV series. Any episode of the original cartoon series will give you more laughs than this entire movie. Not present is Penny's cool computer book. Also not present is the gag with the self-destructing orders that always ends up detonating on the Chief. New are a smooth talking Gadget convertible (the original cartoon had a cooler vehicle that could turn into a van or a car) and an element of a typical, unrealistic Hollywood romance.

{"value":"Wow...where to begin...picked this up at Big Lots for only $2.99. That's three bucks I'll never see again...ever...and for what? I'll tell ya. An hour and fifteen minutes of boring, boring, boring chat and college angst that seemed more suitable for a Lifetime movie than the horror flick advertised on the box. (May the marketing droids who designed it burn in Hell for all eternity). Follow that up with a little bit of cheap gore (not even good gore mind you...) and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere, and makes no sense. Awful, awful, awful...<br /><br />Was there any redeeming qualities? Well, on the Joe Bob Briggs scale, there WERE six breasts involved, but that's hardly worth my long lost three bucks.

{"value":"This is possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't care what the critics say, it's bad. I think the problem is with Kundera's novel. It's not that it's unfilmable; it's just that like 99% of his work, it's pretentious and overdrawn. He seems to be enamored with himself,his characters come off as navel-gazing, and his novels as a whole are misogynistic. I have read many of his works (even his Socialist Realist poetry. That was truly awful) -- I just don't understand what the fuss is about. Characteristics (like the self-absorption) in his novels make for infuriating reading. In a movie, all the things that I dislike about Kundera were magnified. Maybe I just missed something, but I don't think so. On a side note, I cannot believe that this is a Criterion Collection DVD.

{"value":"If you are one of the people who finds \"According to Jim\" great television comedy, this is going to rock your world. And might I add, kudos for proving that good talent, good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than ABC, which prefers to air crap like Jim Belushi's show year after year.<br /><br />\"K-911\" is a big, steaming, brown, German shepherd-sized \"thank you\" for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie. It's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser Belushi deserve. Jim's comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standard.

{"value":"I want to start by stating I am a republican, even though I don't agree with a lot of the things bush has done in office. And I love the daily show and Colbert report. They have to be two of my favorite shows on TV. I enjoy the bush jokes on Conan, Letterman, Leno, because I admit that W is not the smartest guy to ever walk the earth(I do believe he's not the dumbest either.) But it comes to a point when enough is enough and it's not really that funny anymore. I see where it can be funny and it is(hey he's making fun of our authority figure he's hilarious.). Comedy central though is just trying to hard to poke fun at him. I mean maybe one special episode, but an entire series is just dumb. It seems CC is just saying the same bush jokes that we've heard WAY to many times.

{"value":"I can't believe I waste my time watching this garbage! I did because Leonard Maltin gave it an \"AA\" rating, and for TV movies this is usually a reliable indicator of some quality entertainment.<br /><br />The acting was OK, but whoever wrote it should be forever denied access to any medium of communication. The plot is ludicrous, the motivations of the \"bad guys\" totally absent, and the various family interactions silly and shallow. For example, Dad preaches that violent reaction to aggression is BAD, but he turns out to be an \"admirable\" person NOT because of his \"ignore the idiots\" philosophy, but because he's pretty good with his fists...<br /><br />The ONLY message I was able to glean from this pap was that the nuclear family is Good and alternate living arrangements are Bad.

{"value":"This film was screen as part of the 2007 Sydney Mardi Gras Film Festival. I had no expectation of the film as someone else choose it for me.<br /><br />I actually like films that take time to develop, films that allow the characters to unfold and lets the story flow. Stillness is good. But this film though was just plain slow.<br /><br />Credit must go to the two main actors. There was a sense of tension between them as two totally different people, misfits really, come together in a very awkward way. There were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about them.<br /><br />I also liked the setting and the way it was shot. It was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the film's intimacy and reinforces the oddness of the characters.<br /><br />I just don't understand the ending.

{"value":"Interesting? Hardly. The 'scientific evidence' the movie provides for its point (which is basicly that Jews are a cancer) is so stupid and lame, it's almost laughable (if we didn't know what happened in that era).<br /><br />Important? Nah. I can't imagine Germans (even at that horrid time) would like or believe this movie. Compare it to Riefenstahl's Triumf des Willens. Now that was I movie I was impressed with. This is just silly garbage.<br /><br />'Best' part is a scene from M (one of my all-time favorites) where (the jew, as the announcer so eloquently keeps reminding us) Lorre plays a child-molester and murderer. In the eyes of these film-makers, only a depraved mind can do so. Uh-huh. Didn't know M was Hitler's favorite movie, right?<br /><br />No, it's just plain STUPID.

{"value":"There are a lot of highly talented filmmakers/actors in Germany now. None of them are associated with this \"movie\".<br /><br />Why in the world do producers actually invest money in something like this this? You could have made 10 good films with the budget of this garbage! It's not entertaining to have seven grown men running around as dwarfs, pretending to be funny. What IS funny though is that the film's producer (who happens to be the oldest guy of the bunch) is playing the YOUNGEST dwarf.<br /><br />The film is filled with moments that scream for captions saying \"You're supposed to laugh now!\". It's hard to believe that this crap's supposed to be a comedy.<br /><br />Many people actually stood up and left the cinema 30 minutes into the movie.

{"value":"I think if you are into the sixties kind of thing, as I am, you are obligated to waste about 80 minutes of your life watching this barely watchable trainwreck. The saving graces of this oddity include a surprisingly apt social commentary on sixties values along with a number of relatively well known actors caught in early (and embarrassing) footage. It's as if the producers of Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a full length film, covering all the high points (and more) of the issues between the flower children and the establishment, then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a $10,000 budget to complete it. Hardly a classic, but in its own way it does capture how truly strange that time was, the silliness, the over-idealism, and the uptightness of the establishment.

{"value":"I only hope that no classicists/ancient historians saw \"Cleopatra\", or, if they did, that they took it as a laugh. The movie is horrendously inaccurate, more laughably, even, than \"Gladiator\" (which is at least a well-written script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story). Most blatant is Octavius, Caesar's heir, in the Senate before Caesar's assassination: at the ripe old age of 19!<br /><br />Besides this, the acting is mediocre. Timothy Dalton has more than a hint of James Bond in him when he says, \"Caesar. Julius Caesar.\" Billy Zane is a laughably dense Marc Antony. And Leonor Varela tries her best to be the seductive Pharaoh (who in real life was not good-looking at all) but comes off as unbelievable.<br /><br />So this is a warning for all historians--this

{"value":"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! There were people leaving the theatre, others were falling asleep (ok, it was a late night show)... This is a no-sense movie, one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again. I would love to watch the making-off of this movie as I am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage. Do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think they're doing something interesting? I wonder... The soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, stay home. It's the best thing to do. The little, tiny, pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture.

{"value":"For some reason, TV Guide gave this two and a half stars, plus Faye Dunaway is in it, so it definitely looked like something to see. My, oh, my, this may be the worst film I've ever seen. Ever. From its horrid acting (every time the girl asks the boy what's wrong with him, I shouted to the TV \"I can't act!\" When she asks what he needs, I yell \"I need acting lessons!\" to the unbelievably bad dialog (\"Give me back my organs!\").<br /><br />And the Brian DePalma wannabe ending, too, it was all just beyond awful. I wanted to like it. Dunaway is one of the best actors ever. And the production values were pretty good.<br /><br />But wowzers, this had me laughing, LAUGHING!, most of the time.<br /><br />Don't even bother out of curiosity, that was my first mistake.

{"value":"Remember when Harrison Ford was the biggest star in Hollywood because he made great movies? Those days are feeling like a more and more distant memory.<br /><br />While \"Hollywood Homicide\" is by no means terrible, it is a routine and surprisingly boring buddy cop movie. It's a comedy that's not particularly funny, and an action movie that's not especially exciting. An overabundance of subplots cannot mask the weakest of the central storyline.<br /><br />Ford at least appears to be enjoying himself more than is his last few projects, and he is able to carry the film most of the time. Hartnett is adequate, but he and Ford aren't exactly Newman and Redford as far as chemistry is concerned.<br /><br />All in all, \"Hollywood Homicide\" is a reasonably amusing diversion, but just barely. Take out Ford, and it's not even

{"value":"Having watched 10 minutes of this movie I was bewildered, having watched 30 minutes my toes were curling - I simply couldn't believe it: The movie is really awful. In fact it is so awful, that I had to watch all of it just to be convinced(!). During this, I came to realize that it reminded me of a bunch of Danish so-called comedies from the 60's and 70's. The pattern is as follows: Take one extremely popular comedian, make a script putting this comedian in as many grotesque situations as possible, add a bunch of jokes (especially one-liners), and spice it up with a couple of beautiful young girls - film that, and you have a success! I wouldn't know if this movie was a success, but unlike the Danish tradition which died quietly (with a few great comedians) it seems that there is a market for this kind of movie in the US.","finished_norm":["have","watch","minut","of","thi","movi","i","be","bewild","have","watch","minut","my","toe","be","curl","i","simpli","can","not","believ","it","the","movi","be","realli","aw","in","fact","it","be","so","aw","that","i","have","to","watch","all","of","it","just","to","be","convinc","dure","thi","i","come","to","realiz","that","it","remind","me","of","a","bunch","of","danish","socal","comedi","from","the","and","the","pattern","be","a","follow","take","on","extrem","popular","comedian","make","a","script","putt","thi","comedian","in","a","mani","grotesqu","situat","a","possibl","add","a","bunch","of","joke","especi","onelin","and","spice","it","up","with","a","coupl","of","beauti","young","girl","film","that","and","you","have","a","success","i","would","not","know","if","thi","movi","be","a","success","but","unlik","the","danish","tradit","which","die","quietli","with","a","few","great","comedian","it","seem","that","there","be","a","market","for","thi","kind","of","movi","in","the","u"],"filtered":["watch","minut","thi","movi","bewild","watch","minut","toe","curl","simpli","believ","movi","realli","aw","fact","aw","watch","convinc","dure","thi","come","realiz","remind","bunch","danish","socal","comedi","pattern","follow","take","extrem","popular","comedian","make","script","putt","thi","comedian","mani","grotesqu","situat","possibl","add","bunch","joke","especi","onelin","spice","coupl","beauti","young","girl","film","success","know","thi","movi","success","unlik","danish","tradit","die","quietli","great","comedian","seem","market","thi","kind","movi","u"],"filtered2":["watch","minut","bewild","watch","minut","toe","curl","simpli","believ","realli","aw","fact","aw","watch","convinc","dure","come","realiz","remind","bunch","danish","socal","comedi","pattern","follow","take","extrem","popular","comedian","make","script","putt","comedian","mani","grotesqu","situat","possibl","add","bunch","joke","especi","onelin","spice","coupl","beauti","young","girl","success","know","success","unlik","danish","tradit","die","quietli","great","comedian","seem","market","kind","u"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,13,26,31,34,35,50,51,59,77,84,91,97,112,122,127,135,138,201,214,239,253,260,267,293,299,325,329,402,405,419,473,478,532,615,644,951,1213,1241,1448,1634,1785,2143,3314,3516,3666,4018,5454,5460,6168,8225],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,13,26,31,34,35,50,51,59,77,84,91,97,112,122,127,135,138,201,214,239,253,260,267,293,299,325,329,402,405,419,473,478,532,615,644,951,1213,1241,1448,1634,1785,2143,3314,3516,3666,4018,5454,5460,6168,8225],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.8828493162168796,1.1317941569733974,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,3.7386508898401445,1.9463902258768238,2.2212694515902225,2.0105926690411424,2.0545557924622586,2.2466628996789315,2.2489347673732487,2.4359679371086367,2.366244071437088,4.581473037857885,2.561435818751577,2.7303758068497004,2.6593400337329487,2.7073305177318163,2.6754694156628323,2.7085302779237206,2.9012296278682137,2.7949961309240425,2.973659465713028,2.951986790814132,3.084424928710765,3.109204957709252,6.351792664415849,3.335489637924323,3.3243163373261977,6.889205006401399,3.5013187326425523,3.5670958631572662,4.004218291136122,4.251780369798478,4.3215761317340196,4.484804029712395,14.485181202307414,4.770124825978496,5.00274712124725,5.583416318380505,5.604922523601468,5.822646007446338,5.850044981634453,6.342521466732247,13.451027437976705,6.437831646536572,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.0364251469626392,6.178313543025233E-5,6.226344039496654E-5,6.190368157304978E-5,6.19046957951766E-5,6.181816540137689E-5,6.200202128680712E-5,6.179203179805118E-5,6.193096281140048E-5,6.870902256119425E-5,0.7230211762880246,6.169228583509095E-5,6.28437417571789E-5,0.1371074109812094,6.173727120635416E-5,6.156665602586419E-5,6.310235924686173E-5,6.200783040819081E-5,6.181545135590429E-5,6.186668537447823E-5,6.246528184101684E-5,6.206926447719793E-5,6.213993975111163E-5,6.220688856663289E-5,6.26842944777859E-5,6.235647326464652E-5,6.497782094080437E-5,6.17106263860154E-5,6.171227728978995E-5,6.186862499531974E-5,6.318362813599338E-5,6.200423758391983E-5,6.655629656066107E-5,6.217864635448943E-5,6.177779562763683E-5,6.206294087880055E-5,6.17158927326021E-5,6.175236228447956E-5,6.156634671000645E-5,6.158231986075577E-5,6.172093417847809E-5,0.06546885571386632,6.205502111555283E-5,6.18096729088622E-5,6.256072524610495E-5,6.1833395799082E-5,6.388781248882042E-5,6.294832358394323E-5,6.159762643382003E-5,6.173376095519216E-5,6.171234936106291E-5,6.344916685140867E-5,6.1734679435865E-5,6.157685275797568E-5,6.225274684025991E-5,

I wouldn't be surprised if half her contribution turned out to have been left on the cutting-room floor along with several last minute script re-writes.<br /><br />The acting is the least appealing thing about this film. Steve Guttenburg looks like he's trying to flesh out his role with the charm that everyone's told him he has. There's a sensationally stupid sequence in which it's suggested that his sexual prowess will be able to help treat PTSD. It's an uninteresting performance. Elizabeth McGovern is more of a draw with genuine charm and character but it's small consolation.

{"value":"I watched this movie purely for the setting. It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of. The plot was predictable, the acting was mediorcre at best, the scares were all gross-outs, not true scares.<br /><br />I don't remember much of the plot, and I think that's because there wasn't much of one to remember. They didn't even use the hotel to it's fullest potential...The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula. At low tide, you can walk almost 1/4 mile into the bay, which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks.<br /><br />The best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action (and I'm using that term loosly)scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings!","finished_norm":["i","watch","thi","movi","pure","for","the","set","it","be","film","in","a","old","hotel","that","a","friend","own","share","of","the","plot","be","predict","the","act","be","mediorcr","at","well","the","scare","be","all","grossout","not","true","scaresbr","br","i","do","not","rememb","much","of","the","plot","and","i","think","that","becaus","there","be","not","much","of","on","to","rememb","thei","do","not","even","us","the","hotel","to","it","full","potentialth","beach","be","fantast","and","the","hotel","be","situat","on","a","peninsula","at","low","tide","you","can","walk","almost","mile","into","the","bai","which","be","actual","a","eeri","sight","thing","in","the","morn","or","late","at","night","when","the","wind","be","howl","through","the","cracksbr","br","the","well","wai","to","see","thi","movi","be","with","the","remot","in","your","hand","so","you","can","fast","forward","through","the","action","and","i","be","us","that","term","looslyscen","and","paus","at","the","beauti","of","the","surround"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","pure","set","film","old","hotel","friend","share","plot","predict","act","mediorcr","well","scare","grossout","true","scaresbr","br","rememb","much","plot","think","becaus","much","rememb","thei","even","us","hotel","full","potentialth","beach","fantast","hotel","situat","peninsula","low","tide","walk","almost","mile","bai","actual","eeri","sight","thing","morn","late","night","wind","howl","cracksbr","br","well","wai","see","thi","movi","remot","hand","fast","forward","action","us","term","looslyscen","paus","beauti","surround"],"filtered2":["watch","pure","set","old","hotel","friend","share","plot","predict","act","mediorcr","well","scare","grossout","true","scaresbr","rememb","plot","think","becaus","rememb","even","us","hotel","full","potentialth","beach","fantast","hotel","situat","peninsula","low","tide","walk","almost","mile","bai","actual","eeri","sight","thing","morn","late","night","wind","howl","cracksbr","well","wai","see","remot","hand","fast","forward","action","us","term","looslyscen","paus","beauti","surround"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,12,20,21,22,29,32,33,52,56,67,109,129,131,150,161,210,217,235,290,294,304,325,336,337,473,542,623,699,725,858,883,1009,1124,1206,1275,1276,1280,1395,1695,1874,2770,3590,3731,3821,5801,7593],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,12,20,21,22,29,32,33,52,56,67,109,129,131,150,161,210,217,235,290,294,304,325,336,337,473,542,623,699,725,858,883,1009,1124,1206,1275,1276,1280,1395,1695,1874,2770,3590,3731,3821,5801,7593],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3195384777338066,2.742262257014735,1.4018535447685214,1.7122153074726136,3.7221218701403576,1.9570915389266579,2.125691139326857,2.4106958340079214,2.2512118082053005,2.332712011146513,2.4323182980210873,2.687151791517189,2.6113665294700725,2.6457189377809835,5.7225627547931115,2.886778509330039,2.871119826396843,2.973659465713028,2.9233055795674137,2.973659465713028,3.335489637924323,3.4471119148061256,3.607563812710113,3.5813614403160887,3.6466665387238555,3.8767358583910254,3.8614098879127985,4.096025840389245,4.181290492043933,4.364659717870332,4.3095999406873045,13.864138694154438,4.364659717870332,4.403125998698128,4.770124825978496,4.911775343041523,5.3560264761848435,5.7959777603641776,5.7446844659766265,5.7446844659766265,6.389041482367141,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.160163334075452E-5,7.111880678804241E-5,7.167168769554202E-5,7.125756792049312E-5,7.125873539551643E-5,7.115912992364973E-5,7.137076714635945E-5,7.11290474315157E-5,7.128897145975494E-5,0.14036097808032622,0.4142829403356119,7.101422946673849E-5,7.233967484398657E-5,7.33716162012689E-5,7.106601230205232E-5,7.086961650614665E-5,7.263737043927609E-5,7.137745404851193E-5,7.115600577538118E-5,7.121498145284658E-5,7.190402816682927E-5,7.144817104358661E-5,7.152952562546656E-5,7.160659066663982E-5,0.3169683582139916,7.177877819261102E-5,7.479622166819206E-5,7.103534134603206E-5,7.103724170776915E-5,7.121721415791905E-5,7.273091937271534E-5,7.137331833456067E-5,7.661321107551916E-5,7.15740809467185E-5,7.111266012054404E-5,7.144089192494854E-5,7.104140345801086E-5,7.108338370060549E-5,7.086926045146327E-5,7.088764720723449E-5,7.104720668590937E-5,7.179660417176232E-5,7.143177545476134E-5,7.114935418258228E-5,0.06790475302814125,7.117666169351138E-5,7.354150871207326E-5,7.246005939034211E-5,7.090526666284748E-5,7.106197163832702E-5,7.103732466929094E-5,7.303658201778593E-5,7.106302890499138E-5,7.088135400402298E-5,7.165937830324973E-5,7.108133285476679E-5,7.644016144475585E-5,7.102275260036617E-5,7.090

{"value":"I don't remember seeing another murder/mystery movie as bad as this. This movie, about a medical examiner who investigates his friend's mysterious death in a car accident, has the complete receipt for a bad movie: bad acting, boring story, lack of suspense, poor humor and no drama. I remembered seeing this movie on PAX, a TV station notable for dishing out low-budgeted and campy made-for-TV movies such as this one. TV movies, of course, do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the Big Screen. But, this movie sure hit all sour tastes. The makers of this movie have missed out on an opportunity to making \"Receipe for Murder\" a great TV movie; the title does offer some suspense.<br /><br />So, if you want a good recipe, don't watch this movie. This movie alone can kill your TV appetite.<br /><br />Grade

{"value":"The reasons to watch this knock off... err... tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It's on while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on. - Someone pays you to watch it.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and pop in the DVD for Se7en, rent it, download it on iTunes, or put it in your Netflix cue and skip The Flock entirely. The Flock the same story with with a few changes. Furthermore the editing just wreaks of Se7en and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times. The worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots, with sounds of people people chattering over the radio, except there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one.<br /><br />Bottom line: I call it a blatant knock off.

{"value":"I usually enjoy Loretta Young's early movies: her acting back then was light and breezy, and she sure knew how to wear clothes. But this one is just a loser from the word go except for a funny supporting turn by Glenda Farrell. Young is a hatcheck girl who talks her writer-husband (Paul Lukas) into becoming a championship bridge player. It's not the most cinematic of games, and the long, talky middle part in which their marriage falls apart just about kills the film.<br /><br />There's one interesting bit though. As Lukas and Ferdinand Gottschalk start their climactic game, a series of quick shots show airplanes, trains, football games, even a diver in mid-air, freezing in anticipation of the event. It's the earliest use of a freeze frame I've seen in an American film.

{"value":"This film was abysmal. and not in the good way as some have claimed. First off the main character is a very unattractive gingerman. Second - WTF is going on with this van love. The plot, basically, is: boy wants sex so buys a van (which, in fairness is quite cool). Unbelievably given that he looks like a newt he scores with lots of chicks! And he fails with some. Then he scores with a really hot chick and realises he loves this dowdy bird who played hard to get. Then he drag races with the hot chicks boyfriend. And he tips his van. At which point danny devito saves the day. Although he didn't need to because in tipping the van the ginger kid crossed the line first.

{"value":"If it smells like garbage and if it looks like garbage, it must be garbage. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Tony Scott's poor directing style puts shame to an already uninteresting and slightly untrue story of Domino Harvey's life as a bounty hunter. The story is completely discontinuous and confusing to watch. Certain aspects of the plot were ridiculous and totally unbelievable. It seems that all of the action scenes were loosely strung together by poor plot points and horrible acting. Keira Knightley does get totally naked in this one though. That is the one and only upside to this film. If you want to see her naked just fast forward the movie until about an hour and a half into it and you'll catch a whole lot of nipple.

{"value":"This is one very confusing movie. The film is very hard to follow and the plot just didn't seem to make any sense. The Fury of the Wolfman was made in Spain and I think that when any film is dubbed from one language to another, it doesn't translate exactly as it was first meant. Maybe this is part of the problem but I doubt if it can account for all the problems with this film. The dubbing is pretty bad and the voices don't match the characters very well. The scenes are choppy, there is an array of strange and irrelevant characters that do little more than confuse the viewer even more. What I did like about this film was the look of the wolfman himself and the scenes where he attacks. Now if they could have put it all together and had it make some sense, they might have had something.

{"value":"So this was an HBO \"Made for TV Movie\" eh? Is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting? Such a shame to see Jim Belushi reduced to a role so repetitive (shot at, survived, lies, beaten up, survives, shot at, lies and so ad infinitum. Call that a script? As for the Brits, embarrassing to see Timothy Dalton's pathetic (or was he just taking the p***, depends how much he was paid I guess?) attempt at a Southern Sheriff). As for that other Brit, the bleached blond one, what a w***er! There is a trend towards glorifying these \"English speaking\" (sic) super-violent thugs lately, perhaps thanks to Mr. Madonna's two movies succeed in entertaining and justify the violence by skillful use of irony and humour, like Pulp Fiction does.

{"value":"Blank Check is a movie that I saw on TV one day and like most movies they air on TV Blank Check wasn't that good. First of all no one I have ever met has seen Blank Check and that includes people that grew up in the 90s. Also Blank Check won't be remembered in the 00s either simply due to the fact that it will be overshadowed by pixar's films. I wouldn't call Blank Check a bad film but its not really entertaining either. (Or at least it isn't to anyone over the age of 6) Blank Check isn't a entertaining film because nothing about it is original. Everything just makes you go \"what haven't I seen this before?\" Blank Check rips off and tries to cash in on everything from Richie Rich to Home Alone (Which strangely enough both have Macaulay

{"value":"This film is a joke and Quinton should be ashamed of himself, trying to pass this off as a Modesty Blaise Film. If you are having trouble sleeping then all means rent this film. The stick figure they call a actress who is suppose to be Modesty Blaise has got to be the most boring person on this planet. Maybe she could be used as a hat stand in the back ground of a real film.seventy-five minutes of nothing thank you who ever invented the fast forward button. If you see this film if you can call it that coming your way RUN. I can't help but think what 3rd world country could of used the money wasted of this crap. this film is boring the actors are boring waste of colour a waste air they breath If you would like to see Mostey Blaise Film then watch the one they made in the 60's maybe that what the director should of

{"value":"This film was rather a disappointment. After the very slow, very intense (and quite gory) beginning the film begins to lose it. Too much plot leaves too little time for explanation, and coming out of the theater I wondered what this was all about. The characters remain shallow, the story is not convincing at all, most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody, and there are some very cheesy parts... Like, the young cop has to do dig up a body. Of course it's night AND it rains AND he has to do it alone... yawn! Or The Manifestation of the Evil being \"nazis\" plus \"genetic manipulation\"... Wow, that's really original. There are some nice bits, though, like the fistfight scene, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (though Reno and Vincent Cassel do what they can) that's definitely not worth it.

{"value":"the Germans all stand out in the open and get mowed down with a machine gun. the Good guys never die, unless its for dramatic purposes. the \"plot\" has so many holes its laughable. (Where did the German soldiers go once they rolled the fuel tank towards the train? Erik Estrada? Please!) And the whole idea, hijacking a train? How moronic is that! The Germans KNOW where you are going to go, its not like you can leave the track and drive away! What a waste. I would rather bonk myself on the head with a ball peen hammer 10 times then have to sit through that again. I mean, seriously, it FELT like it was made in the 60s, but it was produced in 88!! 1988!! the A-Team is more believable than this horrid excuse for a movie. Only watch it if you need a good laugh.
