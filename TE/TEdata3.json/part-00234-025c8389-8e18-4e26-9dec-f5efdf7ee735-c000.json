{"value":"This movie was terrible. The plot sucked, the acting was bad, the editing was inept and this movie makes me want to poke my eyes out. I wish I had the time I spent watching this movie back. The balloon scene was stupid, the Mormon jokes are really old, the soundtrack sucked, I saw no chemistry between the two leads, it's full of stereotypes, stupid local \"celeb\" cameo's..most noted was Del \"I'm going to drive as fast as I want to..\" computer idiot. What is worst is that these actors had to play themselves on the spiritual side and even they screwed that up. This movie help create a long line of lackluster efforts to mainstream LDS beliefs into Hollywood. I.E. The RM, Church ball, etc. etc. I would forgo watching this movie and instead run head first into a brick wall. You will be more entertained than watching this poor excuse for a show.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","terribl","the","plot","suck","the","act","be","bad","the","edit","be","inept","and","thi","movi","make","me","want","to","poke","my","ey","out","i","wish","i","have","the","time","i","spend","watch","thi","movi","back","the","balloon","scene","be","stupid","the","mormon","joke","be","realli","old","the","soundtrack","suck","i","see","no","chemistri","between","the","two","lead","it","full","of","stereotyp","stupid","local","celeb","cameosmost","note","be","del","i","be","go","to","drive","a","fast","a","i","want","to","comput","idiot","what","be","wrong","be","that","thi","actor","have","to","plai","themselv","on","the","spiritu","side","and","even","thei","screw","that","up","thi","movi","help","creat","a","long","line","of","lacklust","effort","to","mainstream","ld","belief","into","hollywood","ie","the","rm","church","ball","etc","etc","i","would","forgo","watch","thi","movi","and","instead","run","head","into","a","brick","wall","you","will","be","much","entertain","than","watch","thi","poor","excus","for","a","show"],"filtered":["thi","movi","terribl","plot","suck","act","bad","edit","inept","thi","movi","make","want","poke","ey","wish","time","spend","watch","thi","movi","back","balloon","scene","stupid","mormon","joke","realli","old","soundtrack","suck","see","chemistri","two","lead","full","stereotyp","stupid","local","celeb","cameosmost","note","del","go","drive","fast","want","comput","idiot","wrong","thi","actor","plai","themselv","spiritu","side","even","thei","screw","thi","movi","help","creat","long","line","lacklust","effort","mainstream","ld","belief","hollywood","ie","rm","church","ball","etc","etc","forgo","watch","thi","movi","instead","run","head","brick","wall","much","entertain","watch","thi","poor","excus","show"],"filtered2":["terribl","plot","suck","act","bad","edit","inept","make","want","poke","ey","wish","time","spend","watch","back","balloon","scene","stupid","mormon","joke","realli","old","soundtrack","suck","see","chemistri","two","lead","full","stereotyp","stupid","local","celeb","cameosmost","note","del","go","drive","fast","want","comput","idiot","wrong","actor","plai","themselv","spiritu","side","even","screw","help","creat","long","line","lacklust","effort","mainstream","ld","belief","hollywood","ie","rm","church","ball","etc","etc","forgo","watch","instead","run","head","brick","wall","entertain","watch","poor","excus","show"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,6,7,8,9,13,19,21,25,28,32,37,40,41,47,63,67,99,107,136,137,146,152,157,166,185,195,208,214,281,283,300,336,348,362,399,401,421,425,429,436,461,475,542,560,604,617,705,765,796,1085,1130,1132,1309,1413,1416,1513,1705,2444,2531,2741,3003,3046,3390,4705,6397],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,6,7,8,9,13,19,21,25,28,32,37,40,41,47,63,67,99,107,136,137,146,152,157,166,185,195,208,214,281,283,300,336,348,362,399,401,421,425,429,436,461,475,542,560,604,617,705,765,796,1085,1130,1132,1309,1413,1416,1513,1705,2444,2531,2741,3003,3046,3390,4705,6397],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,2.975308642954861,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.7064694353107215,1.8729627573220065,1.9570915389266579,2.056430207256609,2.1439533986393955,4.693651971159972,2.2939035841256437,2.326138445979858,2.3131195476980753,2.3360150694757706,2.4423870329693536,2.518833027372001,2.51289241584188,2.6289494000279396,2.7303758068497004,2.832333801361687,2.7678802023081546,2.932274249550174,2.9233055795674137,3.0103169565570433,3.058539100262467,3.129115117668582,3.0879275592619675,6.519555632377253,3.226987993365636,6.5744693248433315,3.2070272508030975,3.358217889001879,3.3721070011625462,3.4471119148061256,3.4623020803001006,3.5727776966246974,3.5119855004467477,3.6590123745461547,3.965503778955432,3.850067611308864,4.176068548062782,4.416284083275639,4.218628162481577,4.506310234933358,4.449957298382227,4.484804029712395,4.535724120139652,4.751432692966343,5.408212229355414,5.1994574154933035,5.259176650194926,6.1754673820690815,5.463272006538442,5.822646007446338,6.0662680901040895,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6384573438366702E-4,1.637005423951563E-4,1.637409613236306E-4,1.6370804415280187E-4,1.6372353717732094E-4,1.6369963979975108E-4,1.63750552660422E-4,1.6367528396326762E-4,1.6370057699159244E-4,1.6386974379925702E-4,1.6517000252277845E-4,1.6370084738261383E-4,1.6385588242992012E-4,1.6387295338590537E-4,1.6379851018201157E-4,1.637086889750

{"value":"Wow. I don't even really remember that much about this movie, except that it stunk.<br /><br />The plot's basically; a girl's parents neglect her, so this sicko PokeMon pretends to be her dad. Am I the only one disturbed by that? Then, this weirdo PokeMon kidnaps Ash's mom to pretend to be the girl's. I don't care if he was trying to make the girl happy, that's just gross.<br /><br />There was no real plot. The girl was just a whiny brat who wanted things her own way. She played with Unowns, was the \"daughter\" of Entei and apparently could grow and shrink in age on a whim with the help of her \"dad\".<br /><br />That's pretty much all I can remember, but I think you can take it as a hint, and not see it.

{"value":"I completely agree with the other comment someone should do a What's up tiger Lily with this film.<br /><br />It has to be one of the worst french films I've seen in a long time (actually along with Brotherwood of the Wolves, 2 horrendous films in a much too short period of time).<br /><br />It's really sad because the cast is really interesting and the original idea kind of fun. Antoine DeCaunes in particular and Jean Rochefort being among my darlings, I was bitterly disappointed to see them compromised in such a poor film.<br /><br />Lou Doyon is quite bad, as usual which goes to prove that a pretty face and famous parents can get you into the movies but they don't necessarily give you talent.<br /><br />avoid this film, if you want to laugh watch an Alain Chabat

{"value":"Time is precious. This film isn't. I must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like Fargo and this complete waste of time.<br /><br />The theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction: Is this the film the critics are raving about? What a piece of crap!<br /><br />The hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family. Get it?<br /><br />The acting is superb.<br /><br />The production (lighting, sets, editing, sound) is about 2 steps above a 60 minutes story. The characters are shallow and unintelligent. I was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience; the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should

{"value":"I hate this movie! It was NOTHING like the book, and just thinking about it makes me mad. If you watch the movie before reading the book, then yeah, it's a good movie. But King's book was AMAZING and this movie was nothing like it. I mean, the general meaning might be sort of similar but most aspects of the movie are completely different. The ending for example! So in the book it is extremely intense and Danny and Wendy escape seconds before the hotel explodes. but in this horrible movie version jack like takes them through a stupid maze... yeah, there is no maze in the book and there is no reason for it. Another part that made me angry was that jack just kills Mr. Halloran! what the heck, he is basically the hero of the book and they just kill him off like he wasn't important.

{"value":"With these people faking so many shots, using old footage, and gassing animals to get them out, not to mention that some of the scenes were filmed on a created set with actors, what's to believe? Old film of countries is nice, but the animal abuse and degradation of natives is painful to watch in these films. I know, racism is OK in these old films, but there is more to that to make this couple lose credibility. Portrayed as fliers, they never flew their planes, Martin Johnson was an ex-vaudevillian, used friends like Jack London for financial gain while stiffing them of royalties, denying his wife's apparent depression, using her as a cute prop, all this makes these films unbearable. They were by no means the first to travel to these lands, or the first to write about them.

{"value":"I rented End Game, having never heard of it, but I'm fond of political thrillers so I thought I'd give it a shot. After doing some research on the movie, I found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release, but instead had gone strait to DVD. After seeing it, I'm thinking, \"no wonder.\" The movie is shocking in its unoriginality. The plot and the characters are perfunctory. I figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball. I have to say, I didn't expect it to end quite the way it did, but that's not a point in its favor. The more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad. Perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist--even one that made the movie even worse.<br /><br />Stay away.

{"value":"In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', which was a hilarious and poignant comedy  the best thing he's ever done. Ten years on he's reduced to again recycling the plot of 'Home Alone' in this second sequel, which is not connected to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic. The four crooks  that's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series!  are electrocuted with metal chairs, brained with barbells and blinded with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new kid is even less charming than Culkin. You'd think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop Hughes from fossilising the same old routines, but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for

{"value":"I've seen many horror shows over the years, like Nightstalker, that dealt with the Wendigo legend, so I was looking forward to an angry spirit causing mayhem to add flavor to the Halloween season. Man was I mistaken. The whole movie creates this sense of events about to happen that will be scary and creepy, but then delivers a very simplistic tale of revenge and murder over the loss of some property. Ve-ery scary - not! This movie has a lot in common with Cold Creek Manor, another total loser.<br /><br />It's getting harder and harder to believe anything Hollywood puts forward about scary movies, since they rarely come through with anything original and spooky anymore. What idiots pay for such a bogus movie to be made?

{"value":"Essentially a story of man versus nature, this film has beautiful cinematography, the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor but the film really never gets going. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantation's foreman, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of owner Peter Finch's late father whose ghost casts a pall over Elephant Walk that becomes a major point of contention between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right-of-way. The beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture.

{"value":"Greenthumb Grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja-growing in order to pay the bills. It sounds promising and the ever-reliable Brenda Blethyn doesn't disappoint but the material is sitcom-thin. There's actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to \"Give me one\" (a toke) and he thinks she's asking for sex and acts all awkward. Yes, it's humour so twee a nun would be bored. Saving Grace doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of Ryan's Daughter whilst the light-hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of Antiques Roadshow. It does speed up after the first hour but by then it's too clichéd to care.

{"value":"This movie is an utter waste of time, the plot is awful, the dialogue is awful.<br /><br />The acting is OK, but the actors have absolutely no plot or script to work with. The photography and some of the special effects are OK, too, but again there is nothing interesting in this movie to watch. There is no logical progression to the story, the story line is utter nonsense. It isn't even scary. For a movie to be scary, there has to be at least a small element of believability. This movie has no believability at all.<br /><br />There are only three characters in the movie. Each character is shallow and has no personality. <br /><br />Most of the special effects and make up work are both badly done, or at most mediocre.<br /><br />I hope you read this and do not waste

{"value":"This is the first non-zombie subgenre review ive done but this movie is worth doing a review for. Dinocroc is a good movie in general but unfortunately it is still an obvious b-movie. The Dinocroc itself looked great but i thought the movie itself needed a little bit more weight as in action and violence because whenever the croc is shown or is in a fight scene not very much goes on except the croc is shown and the croc either kills or runs off in a repeated process. Jane Longenecker was hot which is a plus and the acting was better than average and the most surprising thing is that the croc looked fleshy instead of like a cartoon coughs* curse of the komodo*coughs. I enjoyed this movie enough to be glad that there is going to be a sequel which is more than what i can say about some movies in general. Overall 3/6 stars and worth a watch.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","nonzombi","subgenr","review","iv","do","but","thi","movi","be","worth","do","a","review","for","dinocroc","be","a","good","movi","in","gener","but","unfortun","it","be","still","a","obviou","bmovi","the","dinocroc","itself","look","great","but","i","think","the","movi","itself","ne","a","littl","bite","much","weight","a","in","action","and","violenc","becaus","whenev","the","croc","be","show","or","be","in","a","fight","scene","not","veri","much","go","on","except","the","croc","be","show","and","the","croc","either","kill","or","run","off","in","a","repeat","process","jane","longeneck","be","hot","which","be","a","plu","and","the","act","be","well","than","averag","and","the","much","surpris","thing","be","that","the","croc","look","fleshi","instead","of","like","a","cartoon","cough","curs","of","the","komodocough","i","enjoi","thi","movi","enough","to","be","glad","that","there","be","go","to","be","a","sequel","which","be","much","than","what","i","can","sai","about","some","movi","in","gener","overal","star","and","worth","a","watch"],"filtered":["thi","nonzombi","subgenr","review","iv","thi","movi","worth","review","dinocroc","good","movi","gener","unfortun","still","obviou","bmovi","dinocroc","look","great","think","movi","ne","littl","bite","much","weight","action","violenc","becaus","whenev","croc","show","fight","scene","veri","much","go","except","croc","show","croc","either","kill","run","repeat","process","jane","longeneck","hot","plu","act","well","averag","much","surpris","thing","croc","look","fleshi","instead","like","cartoon","cough","curs","komodocough","enjoi","thi","movi","enough","glad","go","sequel","much","sai","movi","gener","overal","star","worth","watch"],"filtered2":["nonzombi","subgenr","review","iv","worth","review","dinocroc","good","gener","unfortun","still","obviou","bmovi","dinocroc","look","great","think","ne","littl","bite","weight","action","violenc","becaus","whenev","croc","show","fight","scene","veri","go","except","croc","show","croc","either","kill","run","repeat","process","jane","longeneck","hot","plu","act","well","averag","surpris","thing","croc","look","fleshi","instead","like","cartoon","cough","curs","komodocough","enjoi","enough","glad","go","sequel","gener","overal","star","worth","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,7,12,14,15,16,19,20,21,22,28,29,51,64,76,93,100,110,129,137,152,154,176,200,207,219,225,227,232,233,326,383,387,412,453,643,653,666,749,986,1067,1227,1286,1492,1498,1566,2600,3043,3890,5385,8336],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,7,12,14,15,16,19,20,21,22,28,29,51,64,76,93,100,110,129,137,152,154,176,200,207,219,225,227,232,233,326,383,387,412,453,643,653,666,749,986,1067,1227,1286,1492,1498,1566,2600,3043,3890,5385,8336],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,3.0904588387038183,1.3195384777338066,1.7139899308309823,1.883428577602134,2.1337665533324026,2.035389827120098,2.1405462403177813,2.1290479736304078,2.4106958340079214,2.2939035841256437,2.3131195476980753,2.348499626138016,5.008094298653827,2.5308211829319704,2.5531798379045583,5.158418835671083,5.282438985239508,2.6005321873043625,2.6102777977348763,2.8377834061292515,2.942840385588056,3.0433232530252132,3.360519385990158,3.107414446935464,3.41740676039221,3.5813614403160887,3.9911462095687695,3.6621227969605474,3.7165362186843414,4.039936373738201,4.74221603786142,4.246178114249808,4.499089986959872,4.499089986959872,4.506310234933358,4.74221603786142,5.214056214914456,5.719991853386255,25.956499763696492,6.214688095222362,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9506119461623871E-4,1.9488834103030834E-4,1.9493646046718575E-4,1.9489727200317484E-4,1.9491571671815185E-4,1.9488726647479027E-4,1.949478791203447E-4,1.948582704281235E-4,1.9488838221796693E-4,1.9508977824281062E-4,1.9663775885027948E-4,1.948887041231776E-4,1.9507327604168805E-4,1.950935993115019E-4,1.9500497338335545E-4,1.9489803967532083E-4,1.9496509213860942E-4,1.950568433737983E-4,1.9490810142076923E-4,1.949073888174123E-4,1.9508273764260576E-4,1.9492691654791666E-4,1.9492721155291195E-4,1.9505208401168563E-4,1.9490817172902923E-4,1.9509593116155146E-4,1.9495694674437393E-4,1.9488790424509762E-4,1.9497625809236201E-4,1.9503576765685175E-4,1.9492787269599054E-4,1.950322718197488E-4,1.9512802779626673E-4,1.9530913686235463E-4,1.9495660985328897E-4,1.9489792146657015E-4,1.949681931739204E-4,1.9491771517053693E-4,1.9485847840320695E-4,1.9490804106090198E-4,1.9510337222585741E-4,1.949963457450004E-4,1.950327162646

Comparisons to \"Spinal Tap\" or Christopher Guest are insulting.<br /><br />The movie is so mean-spirited that I cannot imagine anyone familiar with the subject matter finding it funny. Being able to laugh at yourself is an important quality, but if you are the ones being lampooned in this manner, you'd have to hate yourself to enjoy it.<br /><br />The movie is not offensive because of its grand satire of taboo topics but because of its constant pathetic banality.","finished_norm":["you","want","to","see","the","movi","the","gamer","by","dead","gentleman","product","thi","be","not","that","movi","thi","movi","be","not","funni","it","be","a","wast","of","timebr","br","all","of","the","good","comment","here","seem","to","be","write","by","poorli","disguis","fals","parti","the","peopl","who","make","thi","movi","seem","to","be","attempt","to","synthes","fake","interestbr","br","thi","movi","be","not","a","good","do","mockumentari","comparison","to","spinal","tap","or","christoph","guest","be","insultingbr","br","the","movi","be","so","meanspirit","that","i","cannot","imagin","anyon","familiar","with","the","subject","matt","find","it","funni","be","abl","to","laugh","at","yourself","be","a","import","qualiti","but","if","you","be","the","on","be","lampoon","in","thi","manner","you","have","have","to","hate","yourself","to","enjoi","itbr","br","the","movi","be","not","offens","becaus","of","it","grand","satir","of","taboo","topic","but","becaus","of","it","constant","pathet","banal"],"filtered":["want","see","movi","gamer","dead","gentleman","product","thi","movi","thi","movi","funni","wast","timebr","br","good","comment","seem","write","poorli","disguis","fals","parti","peopl","make","thi","movi","seem","attempt","synthes","fake","interestbr","br","thi","movi","good","mockumentari","comparison","spinal","tap","christoph","guest","insultingbr","br","movi","meanspirit","imagin","anyon","familiar","subject","matt","find","funni","abl","laugh","import","qualiti","lampoon","thi","manner","hate","enjoi","itbr","br","movi","offens","becaus","grand","satir","taboo","topic","becaus","constant","pathet","banal"],"filtered2":["want","see","gamer","dead","gentleman","product","funni","wast","timebr","good","comment","seem","write","poorli","disguis","fals","parti","peopl","make","seem","attempt","synthes","fake","interestbr","good","mockumentari","comparison","spinal","tap","christoph","guest","insultingbr","meanspirit","imagin","anyon","familiar","subject","matt","find","funni","abl","laugh","import","qualiti","lampoon","manner","hate","enjoi","itbr","offens","becaus","grand","satir","taboo","topic","becaus","constant","pathet","banal"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,22,23,35,37,38,62,65,89,133,158,177,190,200,228,280,319,339,340,398,408,430,454,550,600,602,639,850,1046,1095,1145,1162,1250,1278,1458,1526,1744,1803,1883,2018,2275,2675,2881,3070,3779,4003,5611,5982,6082,6134,6256],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,22,23,35,37,38,62,65,89,133,158,177,190,200,228,280,319,339,340,398,408,430,454,550,600,602,639,850,1046,1095,1145,1162,1250,1278,1458,1526,1744,1803,1883,2018,2275,2675,2881,3070,3779,4003,5611,5982,6082,6134,6256],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,2.5958480334723544,1.364847727375781,2.926338025798268,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,4.045224089013853,1.9073850067444174,1.9940046109572438,2.3212364753796515,2.3106972614914807,2.458149992634611,2.558331832813986,2.5308211829319704,2.7742700004069256,2.8028805344481915,2.9056060024680126,3.003844442051426,2.948928684455311,3.143848349181566,3.130944944345658,3.1419947805322432,3.2556198060399626,3.4751392270607813,3.558633189238533,3.506637894120152,3.616452760127359,3.9241755834625858,4.067587905068712,4.1554492608600455,4.2574141875167335,4.383707912841026,4.280272325592784,4.535724120139652,4.4919214974812585,4.535724120139652,4.869215728622727,4.8085911068062925,4.848596441419991,4.979216623837056,5.064116067623542,5.243909178064138,5.719991853386255,5.583416318380505,6.137727054086234,5.850044981634453,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141,6.437831646536572,6.794506590475304,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.118807647961301E-4,2.116930065387446E-4,2.1174527517734903E-4,2.117027076039157E-4,2.1172274275403085E-4,2.116918393273706E-4,2.117576784283853E-4,2.1166034303434365E-4,2.1169305127789745E-4,2.119118131072543E-4,2.1359327166519765E-4,2.1169340094007584E-4,2.1189388796842007E-4,2.119159636557949E-4,2.1181969576676975E-4,2.117035414702402E-4,2.1177637567609546E-4,2.118760383584709E-4,2.1171447081128614E-4,2.1171369676217526E-4,2.1190416541618502E-4,2.1173490831315615E-4,2.1173522875559035E-4,2.1187086861014468E-4,2.1171454718202677E-4,2.1191849657462003E-4,2.1176752792775898E-4,2.1169253209079157E-4,2.1178850443817667E-4,2.1185314534259426E-4,2.1173594690714997E-4,2.1184934806943375E-4,2.1195336081055499E-4,2.1215008639459396E-4,2.1176716198751712E-4,2.1170341306868626E-4,2.117797441048321E-4,2.1172491352726227E-4,2.1166056894252505E-4,2.1171440524675981E-4,2.1192657926066708E-4,2.1181032419177943E-4,2.118498308375972E-4,2.1167110326541545E-4,2.1171445908036977E-4,2.117033334601199E-4,2.

{"value":"\"Three Daring Daughters\" is a sickly sweet, rose-colored look at divorce, remarriage, and single-parent living. Obviously, social issues and economic difficulty have no place in the picture perfect life of a single parent mother who feels exhausted, takes a cruise, and then dates and marries a band conductor. Even when the \"its just a movie\" phrase excuses the script from addressing real-life problems, 'Daughters' suffers from too many incoherent high-note songs, children whose personalities are not based on real children and band leader Hose Iturbi playing himself. Isn't it bizarre that any real person would star in a film in which their supposed real self gets married? <br /><br />Admittedly, this movie was released in the nineteen forties.

{"value":"Whale-hunters pick on the wrong freaking whale.<br /><br />A group of yahoo whale exploitists capture a female and string her up by her tail-fin. The whale's mate sees the whole thing including the moment the female's unborn baby slips out and slops onto the deck. 'Captain Nolan' (Richard Harris) could tell that the big male is really mad by the way it stared him down as if to say, \"Get out of town before high-tide.\" <br /><br />This story of revenge has Harris' presence and Bo's beauty, but not much else. This was Bo's first 'released' film, though her first acting job was four years previous in 'And Once Upon a Love' released in 1981 as 'Fantasies' (directed by John Derek).<br /><br />P.S. Today, the date of this review (November 20), is Bo Derek's birthday.

{"value":"I had somewhat high hopes for this since I like Tim Roth. I was not pleased with this film. I liked the Ang Lee The Hulk a few years back so I figured this would have more of a bang to it. First I was very disappointed with John Hurt's performance here. He looks as if his eyebrows were re-shaped for this. His performance was not convincing. He was not as good as one would expect. Tim Roth is cool as always here. The Gama thing didn't really stick to the original story line I don't think. I guess the best part of the film was the end. It had some cool action. The only problem with the original was that it was too long. This one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times. I remember some time ago when Walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and I always wondered why?. Now I know.

{"value":"Is nothing else on TV? Are you really bored? Well, then watch Phat Beach. However, don't rent it and definitely DO NOT buy it. That would be a big mistake.<br /><br />I watched this on TV and found myself laughing at certain points. I did not laugh long and I did not laugh hard. However, there were subtle jokes and comments I laughed at. If you are looking for an extremely funny \"hood\" movie then watch Friday. If you are looking for a powerful emotional movie (something that this movie tries at..kind of) watch something like hoop dreams or Jason's Lyric. If you are lookin for some good black \"booty\" go watch a Dominique Simone porn flick, because the nudity in this movie is nearly non-existent. However, if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable, go ahead and watch it.

{"value":"Don't spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography.When every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers, leaves a lot to be said. I was expecting something better from award winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as Maldeamores. A foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the movie Elsa and Fred for example) but it should not permeate the plot. The movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this

{"value":"I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir, \"Criss Cross.\" I found the latter to be disappointing but it was still better than this film. <br /><br />This movie is a \"neo-noir\" since it's modern-day and it's in color, two things that purists would make it be disqualified for film noir status. <br /><br />The biggest negative to it, however, wasn't the cinematography (that was fine) but the muddled storyline. Hey, some of '40s Dashiell Hammett stories were similar but I didn't care for some of those either. The filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story what seemed like every three minutes. No wonder it was the keep up with this story. It was ridiculous! What happens is that by the 45-minute mark, their is so much confusion nobody cares anymore.

{"value":"As a single woman over 40, I found this film extremely insulting and demeaning to single women over 40, not to mention every other woman, of any age. It was a sad, pathetic attempt by a man to write and direct a \"chick flick\", and it failed miserably. Andy McDowell isn't much of an actress to begin with, but given the non-existent \"plot\" (I hate to even refer to it as a plot) in this, she didn't have a chance. There was no character development, no reason to feel sympathy/empathy for any of the characters, and no attempt to make the film in any way realistic or believable. And then there's the obligatory male-fantasy of an attractive straight woman suddenly deciding to give lesbianism a try -- PLEASE.<br /><br />Not only do I wish I could get my money back for the DVD rental, I also want those 112 minutes of my life back.

{"value":"One of my best friends brought this movie over one night with the words 'Wanna watch the worst horror movie ever?' I always enjoy a good laugh at a bad horror flick and said yes. I had expected your typical cheesy b-slasher but this was beyond B. This is Z-slasher, the lowest of the low. With obviously low budget, extremely bad acting, bad lightning, no plot, really bad so-called 'special effects', shaky cameras and a horrible soundtrack this makes movies like House of Wax look like Oscar-winning masterpieces. The only good thing about it is about 15 seconds of one of the characters getting topless - she had some very nice tits. Most of what I said during this film was along the lines of 'Wow this is actually SO BAD', 'This is the worst movie ever' and 'I'm not drunk enough for this'.

{"value":"This adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety. Timothy Dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of Rochester's character. I get the feeling he never even read the book, just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read \"Grumpy, broody, murky past.\" He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy. There is no chemistry. The only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave. GO AND REREAD THE BOOK. ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY.

{"value":"What a terrible, TERRIBLE, film! One of the worst movies I have seen in my life. I usually love movies like this, the whole \"A guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes, but he happens to already be involved with someone, who not right for him....\". I expected something predictable and I didn't mind. The movies are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy, but not this one! Every single joke falls flat and the \"romance\" makes me want to vomit. The title character is one of the most \"please kill me\" characters that I have ever witnessed on my television, the \"eccentric woman\" isn't very eccentric, more like quirky and annoying. The \"other someone\" is the most reasonable, mature person in this film but also happens to be just as annoying.

{"value":"Truly awful film made by cinematographer-turned-director Ted Tetzlaff. Decent enough looking film but for a time-bomb movie totally devoid of any tension whatsoever. Ford, as someone put it here, sleepwalks though this one with his characteristic smirk. There are some details thrown around- Canadian ex-army or RAF, defused bombs in the war, his wife is leaving him- but none of these back stories add up to much. The bomber himself is a complete mystery. Why is he trying to blow up this shipment of mines? For that matter, what time period are we talking about here? WWII or postwar?? I assumed the latter which makes bomber's motive even more salient. Generally, though, just a horrible film. There are plenty of good time-bomb flicks to skip this one.

{"value":"I am usually disappointed by network movies. Even flix that attract big name actors are usually ruined by the TV people. However, this one is the worst of the worst. The screenplay is weak and the acting, especially that of Tracey Pollan is abominable. I've trudged off to see my kids'high school plays and been treated to better acting. Pollan acts as if she is reading the script as she speaks. When she tries to express fear, anger or grief, it's extremely hollow. Because of the overall quality of the production I found it difficult to take it seriously. If you decide to brave this one just be prepared for a big disappointment. Scary things won't scare you, sad things won't make you sad, romance won't make you feel warm and fuzzy and you will likely be as anxious as I was to see the end arrive. \"First to die\" says a lot

{"value":"This movie was probably the biggest waste of my life ever. The acting was pathetic. Jordan Hinson could not show any upset emotions. At the beginning of the movie, she was supposed to be discouraged. Instead, she bobbed her head with her bottom lip stuck out. She sobbed pitifully without any tears for the crying scene. I was almost angry that out of all girls who wanted to be actresses, they had to pluck out her. Everyone else was suffering from over-acting as well. It was flat out annoying. It was also an insult to figure skaters. Jordan took a month to train, and they cast her as a person who makes the Olympic team. It's practically spitting on the effort real figure skaters put into their work. A pitiful excuse for a movie, and a pitiful attempt to associate hockey and skating. Don't waste your life.

{"value":"This TV-made thriller is all talk, little action. It works hard to set up its convoluted plot, yet the writing is so muddled the exposition is still cloudy at best. By the end, I knew no more about these characters than I did at the beginning. It has a quasi-\"Ten Little Indians\" scenario, but ditches it mid-way through in favor of spotlighting Sally Field and her uncovering of a killer. Field overacts here with a gracelessness I've seldom seen from her. The early introductions are good, but the writing quickly strays off-course and eventually goes over the top. Lots of hysteria, and constant thunder and lightning effects (which adds nothing). A curious failure from producers Aaron Spelling & Leonard Goldberg.

{"value":"I have never understood the appeal of this show. The acting is poor (Debra Jo Rupp being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode. Furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny, clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that.

{"value":"Mind, my friends and I saw the movie based off it's title alone. It's cute, though obvious in it's plot and direction-- you know where the movie is going within the first five minutes. My main contention with the plot is that while it remains tolerably consistent, they never explain a lot of the things behind the characters. An alcoholic father, overworked mother, stressed-out sister... that's a bad family, but aside from the occasional mention from the sister, there's not any resolution. I was also confused as to the scene with the bottles... it seemed pretty random.<br /><br />The writing is a secondary concern... the kids weren't bad actors, but their script left a lot to be desired. Unfortunately, what could have been a cute niche movie was pushed aside for a single, blah special effect, lame scripting, and a glaringly obvious
