{"value":"I missed this movie in the cinema but had some idea in the back of my head that it was worth a look, so when I saw it on the shelves in DVD I thought \"time to watch it\". Big mistake!<br /><br />A long list of stars cannot save this turkey, surely one of the worst movies ever. An incomprehensible plot is poorly delivered and poorly presented. Perhaps it would have made more sense if I'd read Robbins' novel but unless the film is completely different to the novel, and with Robbins assisting in the screenplay I doubt it, the novel would have to be an excruciating read as well.<br /><br />I hope the actors were well paid as they looked embarrassed to be in this waste of celluloid and more lately DVD blanks, take for example Pat Morita. Even Thurman has the grace to look uncomfortable at times.<br /><br />Save yourself around 98 minutes of your life for something more worthwhile, like trimming your toenails or sorting out your sock drawer. Even when you see it in the \"under $5\" throw-away bin at your local store, resist the

{"value":"This is a typical 70's soft core sex romp in the Russ Meyer genre, though perhaps less outlandish than some of Meyer's work. This film has higher 'production values' than many of it's contemporaries, suggesting a larger budget. It's plot, writing and acting are straight out the B zone, though. Of late, this film has become a mainstay of B movie channels (such as \"Drive In Classics\") in the 500 channel universe. If soft core is what you are in the mood for, this is as \"good\" as anything else in the B range. Don't expect Polanski though, Sarno is just Sarno. Nothing more, nothing less. Jennifer Welles performance as the \"mother\" is perhaps the best of the cast. None of the actors in the film went on to greater fame, unsurprisingly. Confessions of a Young American Housewife is far from the worst example of it's kind. It is watchable, if this is your type of film. 30 years ago, this would have been an avant garde and riske film. You can see more or less the same kind of thing on Showtime/HBO series these days, and in prime time.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","typic","soft","core","sex","romp","in","the","russ","meyer","genr","though","perhap","littl","outlandish","than","some","of","meyer","work","thi","film","have","high","product","valu","than","mani","of","it","contemporari","suggest","a","larg","budget","it","plot","write","and","act","be","straight","out","the","b","zone","though","of","late","thi","film","have","becom","a","mainstai","of","b","movi","channel","such","a","drive","in","classic","in","the","channel","univers","if","soft","core","be","what","you","be","in","the","mood","for","thi","be","a","good","a","anyth","els","in","the","b","rang","do","not","expect","polanski","though","sarno","be","just","sarno","noth","much","noth","littl","jennif","well","perform","a","the","mother","be","perhap","the","well","of","the","cast","none","of","the","actor","in","the","film","go","on","to","great","fame","unsurprisingli","confess","of","a","young","american","housewif","be","far","from","the","wrong","exampl","of","it","kind","it","be","watchabl","if","thi","be","your","typ","of","film","year","ago","thi","would","have","be","a","avant","gard","and","risk","film","you","can","see","much","or","littl","the","same","kind","of","thing","on","showtimehbo","seri","thi","dai","and","in","prime","time"],"filtered":["thi","typic","soft","core","sex","romp","russ","meyer","genr","though","perhap","littl","outlandish","meyer","work","thi","film","high","product","valu","mani","contemporari","suggest","larg","budget","plot","write","act","straight","b","zone","though","late","thi","film","becom","mainstai","b","movi","channel","drive","classic","channel","univers","soft","core","mood","thi","good","anyth","els","b","rang","expect","polanski","though","sarno","sarno","noth","much","noth","littl","jennif","well","perform","mother","perhap","well","cast","none","actor","film","go","great","fame","unsurprisingli","confess","young","american","housewif","far","wrong","exampl","kind","watchabl","thi","typ","film","year","ago","thi","avant","gard","risk","film","see","much","littl","kind","thing","showtimehbo","seri","thi","dai","prime","time"],"filtered2":["typic","soft","core","sex","romp","russ","meyer","genr","though","perhap","littl","outlandish","meyer","work","high","product","valu","mani","contemporari","suggest","larg","budget","plot","write","act","straight","b","zone","though","late","becom","mainstai","b","channel","drive","classic","channel","univers","soft","core","mood","good","anyth","els","b","rang","expect","polanski","though","sarno","sarno","noth","noth","littl","jennif","well","perform","mother","perhap","well","cast","none","actor","go","great","fame","unsurprisingli","confess","young","american","housewif","far","wrong","exampl","kind","watchabl","typ","year","ago","avant","gard","risk","see","littl","kind","thing","showtimehbo","dai","prime","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,8,14,20,21,25,29,32,41,48,49,50,51,57,65,86,92,101,104,105,115,122,130,132,135,150,190,196,211,223,254,256,307,318,332,370,384,397,451,461,467,548,564,610,613,642,646,728,913,1129,1178,1554,1576,1927,1972,1990,2190,2208,2209,2232,2682,3300,3560,4490,5040,5183,7740],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,8,14,20,21,25,29,32,41,48,49,50,51,57,65,86,92,101,104,105,115,122,130,132,135,150,190,196,211,223,254,256,307,318,332,370,384,397,451,461,467,548,564,610,613,642,646,728,913,1129,1178,1554,1576,1927,1972,1990,2190,2208,2209,2232,2682,3300,3560,4490,5040,5183,7740],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,3.3525245991777624,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,3.3840606616174704,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.834162586674748,1.9073850067444174,6.0933371978169575,2.0489535369135887,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.1765612129984904,2.201553588425805,4.497869534746497,2.2642139034199635,2.253494045787767,2.366244071437088,2.332712011146513,2.558331832813986,2.478925055209576,2.5687161421197025,2.825563294794476,2.889652074525771,2.748952192422636,2.8767855639325206,5.805372584729356,2.9705344631698933,2.9958122703541616,3.109204957709252,3.3176717946075294,3.216957819005698,3.358217889001879,3.342254038012865,3.459754308221302,3.469984576472117,3.477726550625732,3.5364100524538222,10.867268781341588,3.5900195030592035,7.5481634086618845,4.067587905068712,4.197121957260614,4.229557233013768,4.589376833631972,4.848596441419991,4.848596441419991,4.900964426937307,9.912454211224713,5.014723312293965,10.078229530836248,5.143104478942172,5.064116067623542,5.373120909544144,12.2754

{"value":"Yes, he is! ...No, not because of Pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies. Pintilie IS THE naked \"emperor\" - so to speak...<br /><br />It's big time for someone to state the truth. This impostor is a voyeur, a brat locked in an old man's body. His abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever. It is 100% visual perversion: he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies. And if he does this in front of the audience, he might eve get a hard-on! Did you know that, on the set of \"Niki Ardelean\", he used to embarrass poor Coca Bloss, by telling her: \"Oh, Coca, how I wanna f*** you!\"? She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she became unspeakably ashamed - to his petty satisfaction! And, as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in Romanian audiences, so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities \"works of art\"!

{"value":"Hey,<br /><br />If your going to make a documentary about Leonard Cohen try making it about Leonard Cohen! This is filled with only enough Leonard to anger the viewer who will be left wondering why they are listening to all these other singers (some of them questionable) talk about themselves. Puleeze....sounds like them reliving their diary entries in junior high - who cares about you, what about Leonard? Guess what people, if you \"do something\" worthy maybe someone will make a documentary about you. I found particularly insulting the parading of U2's members as if that would add credibility to this movie - NOT. Leonard doesn't need Bono or the Edge talking about his spirituality. What would have been nice would have been for the filmmakers to embody some piece of his spirituality through the film. Gee, what a concept!

{"value":"Yes, he is! ...No, not because of Pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies. Pintilie IS THE naked \"emperor\" - so to speak...<br /><br />It's big time for someone to state the truth. This impostor is a voyeur, a brat locked in an old man's body. His abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever. It is 100% visual perversion: he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies. And if he does this in front of the audience, he might eve get a hard-on! Did you know that, on the set of \"Niki Ardelean\", he used to embarrass poor Coca Bloss, by telling her: \"Oh, Coca, how I wanna f*** you!\"? She is a great lady, very decent and sensitive, and she became unspeakably ashamed - to his petty satisfaction! And, as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in Romanian audiences, so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities \"works of art\"!

{"value":"But it does have some good action and a plot that is somewhat interesting. Nevsky acts like a body builder and he isn't all that attractive, in fact, IMO, he is UGLY. ( his acting skills lack everything! ) Sascha is played very well by Joanna Pacula, but she needed more lines than she was given, her character needed to be developed. There are way too many men in this story, there is zero romance, too much action, and way too dumb of an ending. It is very violent. I did however love the scenery, this movie takes you all over the world, and that is a bonus. I also liked how it had some stuff about the mafia in it, not too much or too little, but enough that it got my attention. The actors needed to be more handsome...The biggest problem I had was that Nevsky was just too normal, not sexy enough. I think for most guys, Sascha will be hot enough, but for us ladies that are fans of action, Nevsky just doesn't cut it. Overall, this movie was fine, I didn't love it nor did I hate it, just found it to be another normal action flick.","finished_norm":["but","it","doe","have","some","good","action","and","a","plot","that","be","somewhat","interest","nevski","act","like","a","bodi","builder","and","he","be","not","all","that","attract","in","fact","imo","he","be","ugli","hi","act","skill","lack","everyth","sascha","be","plai","veri","good","by","joanna","pacula","but","she","ne","much","line","than","she","be","give","her","charact","ne","to","be","develop","there","be","wai","too","mani","man","in","thi","stori","there","be","zero","romanc","too","much","action","and","wai","too","dumb","of","a","end","it","be","veri","violent","i","do","howev","love","the","sceneri","thi","movi","take","you","all","over","the","world","and","that","be","a","bonu","i","conjur","like","how","it","have","some","stuff","about","the","mafia","in","it","not","too","much","or","too","littl","but","enough","that","it","get","my","attent","the","actor","ne","to","be","much","handsometh","big","problem","i","have","be","that","nevski","be","just","too","normal","not","sexi","enough","i","think","for","much","gui","sascha","will","be","hot","enough","but","for","u","ladi","that","be","fan","of","action","nevski","just","doe","not","cut","it","overal","thi","movi","be","fine","i","do","not","love","it","nor","do","i","hate","it","just","find","it","to","be","anoth","normal","action","flick"],"filtered":["doe","good","action","plot","somewhat","interest","nevski","act","like","bodi","builder","attract","fact","imo","ugli","hi","act","skill","lack","everyth","sascha","plai","veri","good","joanna","pacula","ne","much","line","give","charact","ne","develop","wai","mani","man","thi","stori","zero","romanc","much","action","wai","dumb","end","veri","violent","howev","love","sceneri","thi","movi","take","world","bonu","conjur","like","stuff","mafia","much","littl","enough","get","attent","actor","ne","much","handsometh","big","problem","nevski","normal","sexi","enough","think","much","gui","sascha","hot","enough","u","ladi","fan","action","nevski","doe","cut","overal","thi","movi","fine","love","hate","find","anoth","normal","action","flick"],"filtered2":["doe","good","action","plot","somewhat","interest","nevski","act","like","bodi","builder","attract","fact","imo","ugli","act","skill","lack","everyth","sascha","plai","veri","good","joanna","pacula","ne","line","give","charact","ne","develop","wai","mani","man","stori","zero","romanc","action","wai","dumb","end","veri","violent","howev","love","sceneri","take","world","bonu","conjur","like","stuff","mafia","littl","enough","get","attent","actor","ne","handsometh","big","problem","nevski","normal","sexi","enough","think","gui","sascha","hot","enough","u","ladi","fan","action","nevski","doe","cut","overal","fine","love","hate","find","anoth","normal","action","flick"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,10,12,14,15,17,18,21,24,30,31,32,33,38,39,40,41,45,50,54,55,60,73,82,93,97,107,110,112,113,129,140,165,167,183,193,257,303,320,339,361,376,412,420,464,472,596,636,648,666,700,892,895,964,966,976,1087,1138,2774,4017,5367,5392],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,10,12,14,15,17,18,21,24,30,31,32,33,38,39,40,41,45,50,54,55,60,73,82,93,97,107,110,112,113,129,140,165,167,183,193,257,303,320,339,361,376,412,420,464,472,596,636,648,666,700,892,895,964,966,976,1087,1138,2774,4017,5367,5392],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,2.430631986809635,2.324031090670098,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,2.803707089537043,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.8162961064622165,1.717994385570355,3.6227786505458823,1.9536997889255368,1.838176641236591,1.8950689206770979,2.020196584395323,6.106169481360294,2.0545557924622586,2.1439533986393955,6.387143920891223,2.2466628996789315,2.1521782565202803,9.642783336031686,2.317169775997098,2.448847599972298,2.4609576687888097,2.4885128563647294,2.517840471459249,2.7602659523229094,2.868298950055202,2.938298364153555,3.003844442051426,3.0399731661399314,3.1569204307489187,3.107414446935464,3.3023374306074227,3.2872346624216657,3.4222967456864013,3.485528930909917,3.530930586689197,3.6105180246075443,3.6621227969605474,7.232905520254718,3.9825254665248626,3.9954846111673676,4.062925891962901,4.026392148630444,4.058285512406398,4.176068548062782,4.224077767249142,5.626901430320244,5.7959777603641776,6.2980697041614135,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.5360363215407883E-4,1.534675162101465E-4,1.5350540852540745E-4,1.534745490280971E-4,1.534890735736895E-4,1.5346667003656055E-4

{"value":"A huge disappointment from writer Hamm and director Dante. Their previous collaboration on the first season's \"Homecoming\" was twisted and darkly hilarious in all the right ways. This poor handling of an intriguing premise left me bewildered. The supposed \"payoff\" showing generic aliens extracting something from the brains of the infected psychopaths was completely unsatisfying and explained nothing. If the point of the story was an extraterrestrial \"cleaning\" of the planet of it's human infestation, why did they go about it in such a gratuitously sadistic and misogynistic fashion? Why not just unleash a completely lethal virus a la Stephen King's \"The Stand\" instead of having the male population butcher the females? I kept hoping the episode would improve as I kept watching but it just got more pretentious and preposterous. The religious subtext simply seemed forced but it was clear Sam Hamm must have thought it was profound by the weight he gave it. I like a lot of both Dante and Hamm's work but this was just

{"value":"I cant believe blockbuster carries this movie. It was SO BAD. I was totally fooled by the box art. DON'T BE FOOLED!! Its not worth your time I promise you. I don't know if the positive reviews for this flick were a joke or what. I am so disappointed. :( <br /><br />The description on the back of the box doesn't even match! The girl that has the voodoo done on her is a stripper. The synopsis on the back says she is only 17. Did the people writing the description for the film even bother to watch it!? Those positive reviews had to be a joke they just had to be. If anyone actually liked this flick then I've lost all faith in humanity.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the story compared to the title. Or the fact that the entire movie was done all in 2 locations. Or that the cops didn't even have close to real uniforms. Why would i even say that?? Who cares about the cops uniforms!? Compared to the rest of the movie the uniforms were spot on. <br /><br />This movie is an insult to the zombie genre and all of its fans.","finished_norm":["i","cant","believ","blockbust","carri","thi","movi","it","be","so","bad","i","be","total","fool","by","the","box","art","don","t","be","fool","it","not","worth","your","time","i","promis","you","i","do","not","know","if","the","posit","review","for","thi","flick","be","a","joke","or","what","i","be","so","disappoint","br","br","the","descript","on","the","back","of","the","box","doe","not","even","match","the","girl","that","have","the","voodoo","do","on","her","be","a","stripper","the","synopsi","on","the","back","sai","she","be","onli","do","the","peopl","write","the","descript","for","the","film","even","bother","to","watch","it","that","posit","review","have","to","be","a","joke","thei","just","have","to","be","if","anyon","actual","like","thi","flick","then","i","have","lose","all","faith","in","humanitybr","br","and","do","not","even","get","me","start","on","the","stori","compar","to","the","titl","or","the","fact","that","the","entir","movi","be","do","all","in","locat","or","that","the","cop","do","not","even","have","close","to","real","uniform","why","would","i","even","sai","that","who","care","about","the","cop","uniform","compar","to","the","rest","of","the","movi","the","uniform","be","spot","on","br","br","thi","movi","be","a","insult","to","the","zombi","genr","and","all","of","it","fan"],"filtered":["cant","believ","blockbust","carri","thi","movi","bad","total","fool","box","art","fool","worth","time","promis","know","posit","review","thi","flick","joke","disappoint","br","br","descript","back","box","doe","even","match","girl","voodoo","stripper","synopsi","back","sai","onli","peopl","write","descript","film","even","bother","watch","posit","review","joke","thei","anyon","actual","like","thi","flick","lose","faith","humanitybr","br","even","get","start","stori","compar","titl","fact","entir","movi","locat","cop","even","close","real","uniform","even","sai","care","cop","uniform","compar","rest","movi","uniform","spot","br","br","thi","movi","insult","zombi","genr","fan"],"filtered2":["cant","believ","blockbust","carri","bad","total","fool","box","art","fool","worth","time","promis","know","posit","review","flick","joke","disappoint","descript","back","box","doe","even","match","girl","voodoo","stripper","synopsi","back","onli","peopl","write","descript","even","bother","watch","posit","review","joke","anyon","actual","like","flick","lose","faith","humanitybr","even","get","start","stori","compar","titl","fact","entir","locat","cop","even","close","real","uniform","even","care","cop","uniform","compar","rest","uniform","spot","insult","zombi","genr","fan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,7,8,9,11,17,18,23,26,52,63,65,71,80,84,91,97,140,158,176,184,187,198,205,214,219,221,226,257,264,268,295,382,467,476,482,496,509,621,654,683,709,775,919,1005,1057,1072,1455,1680,2070,2557,2713,3837,3991],"values":[1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,7,8,9,11,17,18,23,26,52,63,65,71,80,84,91,97,140,158,176,184,187,198,205,214,219,221,226,257,264,268,295,382,467,476,482,496,509,621,654,683,709,775,919,1005,1057,1072,1455,1680,2070,2557,2713,3837,3991],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,4.630085528630655,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.7122153074726136,3.745925514644013,1.9073850067444174,1.9214926742550966,1.9951803900462557,2.2212694515902225,2.0105926690411424,2.0545557924622586,2.317169775997098,2.3106972614914807,5.008094298653827,2.496249838866882,2.4732161909892554,2.5439726117360975,2.571852579609833,5.460751613699401,2.5792094178355414,2.6423424573643777,2.5940874818617203,5.520531904645819,2.757740698455715,3.6746621462132825,2.7910771187233068,3.235085203598255,3.342254038012865,7.221036049215089,6.630933444098431,3.293679367864308,6.721038771980316,3.5446859617576822,7.268942531260074,3.6105180246075443,3.6497387377608255,3.753391311073496,4.235066888824737,4.062925891962901,8.362580984087867,4.268777946167049,4.637773374493822,4.671389985292807,9.889855100716847,5.2288713006995975,16.22463668806624,5.878215858601149,5.907203395474402]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6833549634637528E-4,1.6818632575280805E-4,1.682278522558452E-4,1.6819403307641637E-4,1.6820995064657549E-4,1.6818539842414668E-4,1.6823770641802698E-4,1.68160375179942E-4,1.6818636129726865E-4,1.6836016367693187E-4,1.6969605257274991E-4,1.681866390976457E-4,1.6834592247317914E-4,1.683634612138714E-4,1.6828697808952142E-4,1.681946955683691E-4,1.6825256104853876E-4,1.683317412757813E-4,1.6820337873529783E-4,1.682027637670566E-4,1.6835408772249922E-4,1.6821961596676468E-4,1.6821987055257507E-4,1.683276340027529E-4,

{"value":"I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening and I'm glad I didn't pay for it. This movie is just disgusting. Its full of dick and fart jokes and takes no pride in the action sequences(such as the shootout in \"Little Germany\"). I made a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie.. and a lot of which I didn't agree of.<br /><br />1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. The fart jokes. 3. The Poop jokes. 4. The Dude was a pussy. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. The Talibans 7. Again making fun of Bush.. WE GET IT HE'S AN IDIOT.. move on. 8. The Dude has blonde hair. 9. The Plot. 10. The killing of minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the cast were just outrages and out there.<br /><br />Now the (few) good ones<br /><br />1. The Dude uses a cat as a silencer like in the game. 2. Lots of action. 3. Crotchy made a return (and a cameo of the maker of Postal) 4. Uhm.. I didn't have to pay for it. 5. There are a few \"what the ef\" moments<br /><br />Boll did it again. He made another crappy game into movie adaption.

{"value":"one may ask why? the characters snarl, yell, and chew the scenery without any perceptible reason except someone wanted to make a movie in barcelona. billie baldwin, is that the right one?, is forgettable in the cop/estranged-husband/loving-father-of-cute-little-blond-girl role. the story seems to have been cut and pasted from the scenes thrown away from adventure films in the last three years. ellen pompeo's lack of charisma is a black hole that seems to suck the energy out of every scene she is in. her true acting range is displayed when she takes her blouse off as the movies careens from one limp chase scene to another. unfortunately, the directing rarely goes bad enough to be camp or a parody. it is all just cliché, familiar in every respect. the director cast his own daughter as the precocious brat probably because no respectable agent would have permitted a client to ruin a career by being in such a lame, contrived and uninteresting movie. the only heist here is

{"value":"1/10 and that's only because I don't go lower with my ratings.<br /><br />skip this \"movie\" and wait for the last movie of the \"Trilogy\", don't buy or rent it. trust me you won't be missing a thing. the Architect brings no new info: _(spoiler)_ there have been more NEO's before him, he's like nr.6 or something. you could already figure something like that out from the first movie: Agent Smith telling us the first Matrix created didn't work because it was too perfect.

{"value":"wow! i watched the trailer for this one and though 'nah, this one is not for me'. i watched my husband and our friend's faces during the trailer, and knew this was a 'boy movie'. i mean, hallo! a bunch of chick barmaids that dance - another striptease?<br /><br />then, i started watching it, it didn't look all that bad. so i carried on watching. i watched it right to the end. what an awesome movie. if anything, this is a chick-flick. these girls have attitude. it is really a feel-good movie, and a bit of a love story. really leaves you with a nice feeling.<br /><br />basically, the story of a small-town girl making it big in the city, after going through the usual big-city c**p. there have been a couple of these, it is almost a new urban legend. but it also makes you think of your life, and what you have achieved. well, me anyway. i think it is because the whole working in a bar scenario is very familiar, not just for me, but for many people i know.

{"value":"This inept adaptation of arguably one of Martin Amis's weaker novels fails to even draw comparisons with other druggy oeuvres such as Requiem For A Dream or anything penned by Irvine Walsh as it struggles to decide whether it is a slap-stick cartoon or a hyper-realistic hallucination.<br /><br />Boringly directed by William Marsh in over-saturated hues, a group of public school drop-outs converge in a mansion awaiting the appearance of three American friends for a weekend of decadent drug-taking. And that's it. Except for the ludicrous sub-plot soon-to-be-the-main-plot nonsense about an extremist cult group who express themselves with the violent killings of the world's elite figures, be it political or pampered. Within the first reel you know exactly where this is going.<br /><br />What is a talented actor like Paul Bettany doing in this tiresome, badly written bore?

{"value":"This movie was a littttle confusing at first. I usually like Gina Phillips, but this one I have to say was a bad choice just like her doing the movie Ring Around the Rosie, that one also not one her good movies. Jeepers Creepers was way better. Anyway, Faye Dunaway was good. She totally creeped me out and at the end, that was crazy. It was about Jennifer Cassi(Phillips) who comes to her twin sisters funeral. She stays at a house that her sister owns and her grandmother(Dunaway) lives at with an Aunt named Emma. Mary Ellen(Dunaway) is kinda sacrificing her relations to stay alive and as long as she wants to live, she can't die. Even if Jennifer tries to kill her, which she tries. Ravens have a weird part in it. When the relations go to sleep, the Ravens eat there organs, so they can't go to sleep. But they do. Basically it all crazy and Mary Ellen will never die and her relations will be buried, but not dead, b/c they have to suffer forever so Mary Ellen can stay alive. Yeah, I hope this helps. If it doesn't, sorry.

{"value":"An average TV movie quality, totally formula story of religious fanatic (Ron Perlman, who gives good \"I'm not just the President of 'Psychos R Us,' I'm also a client.\") who gets control of a biochemical virus (think the virus from the movie \"The Rock\"). Too bad for him that he also gets stuck in a bank building during an earthquake with bank robbers and the government agents trying to stop him (led by the impressively physiqued, mildly entertaining Wolf Larson, backed by Fred Dryer) along with the standard \"in the wrong place at the wrong time\" spunky female (the forever bland Erika Eleniak) and \"lived as a wimp but died as a hero at the last minute\" male (Brandon Karrer). Has the standard background story to give sympathy to the religious fanatic (wife and son killed in a police raid a few years previous). <br /><br />Basically a decent rainy day movie.<br /><br

{"value":"This movie had all the elements to be a smart, sparkling comedy, but for some reason it took the dumbass route. Perhaps it didn't really know who its audience was: but it's hardly a man's movie given the cast and plot, yet is too slapstick and dumb-blonde to appeal fully to women.<br /><br />If you have seen Legally Blonde and its sequel, then this is like the bewilderingly awful sequel. Great actors such as Luke Wilson should expect better material. Jessica Simpson could also have managed so much more. Rachael Leigh Cook and Penelope Anne Miller languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusing.<br /><br />Many things in this movie were paint-by-numbers, the various uber-cliché montages, the last minute \"misunderstanding\", even the kids' party chaos. This just suggests lazy scriptwriting.<br /><br />It should be possible to find this movie enjoyable if you don't take it seriously, but it's such a glaring could-do-better than you'll likely feel frustrated and increasingly disappointed as the scenes roll

{"value":"This film reminds me a lot of the anti-drug films of the 50's and 60's due to the fact that it was made by people that have obviously never experienced the social evil that they are warning us about. Tom Hanks and his buddies are \"role playing\", but there are no dice, lots of candles, and then you are just swept away in a bad montage showing Hanks falling for the lady in the group. quite funny but misguided. I wonder how many poor kids had their D&D stuff destroyed, and were told that the use of their imagination was the road to destruction. As a film it's basically an after school special, bad acting (although Hanks does show some of his talent) and relationship talks, and no one seems to be having any fun. It seems these films have a psychological focus on adolescents starting on the road to adultism, which is more serious, apparently, and requires you to buckle down and do the things everyone else does. Despite my vote of 2, this is worth watching due to its unique genre, scare films, which I personally find quite

{"value":"Over the years I've seen a bunch of these straight to video Segal movies, and every one holds the same amount of entertainment; unfortanetley, the entertainment level is at a low. Sure, the action sequences were amusing, but that was pretty much it. Seagal was really in his prime when he did movies like; Under Siege, Under Siege 2, and Executive Decision(at least on the action standpoint), but during the past ten years, these types of movies that star Segal really do not meet his past qualifications.<br /><br />On the more positive side, the movie did make good use of time, like some of the action sequences and use of wit. Just when the movie seemed to just drag on, a pretty cool action scene brought it up out of the gutter. I honestly believe that more of Segal's movies would do better if he wasn't the only one that fans recognize in the movie. Supporting actors and actresses are a very important thing, and if his current movies had this known supporting actors and actresses, maybe the movie will get more popular

{"value":"George P. Cosmatos' \"Rambo: First Blood Part II\" is pure wish-fulfillment. The United States clearly didn't win the war in Vietnam. They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh-so innocent soldiers. The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation, who made this war happen. The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this. He is extremely patriotic, bemoans that US-Americans didn't appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier, but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians. Like every film that defends the war (e.g. \"We Were Soldiers\") also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia. And for that matter also the reason for every single US-American soldier that was there. Instead, Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation.

{"value":"obviously has some talent attached, Maria Bello is always great. but this is just a dreary wast of time, portraying every character as someone to be loathed and exploited so someone could make a movie out of an 'interesting' story. well, i hope they got it out of their systems. unfortunately for the audience, there is no insight, no sensitivity, no context, and really no humanity. which would all be fine, except it has no humor, no horror, no context, and nothing constructive to say about the story it's trying to tell. bad things happen, you sit and watch it, you don't care, so what? 99% of the time, the words 'based on a true story' constitute an unintentional warning to the audience. it means the director and screenwriter are lazy and fascinated by some events they heard about somewhere, so they just throw them up on the screen and expect the 'true' nature of the story to make the audience feel something without the filmmakers having to do any of the work. i hope they

{"value":"The acting is good, the women are beautiful, and the men are handsome, so if you're looking for well-acted soft porn, this movie is for you. Otherwise, you are wasting your time. The motivation of the main characters, in particular the eponymous lead, is often a mystery. She could have just told the truth - the truth as presented in the film, not necessarily the historical truth - and her lover would have been spared time in jail for a rape he did not commit. Was she protecting her father, who went off half-cocked, as it were, when he impetuously instigated a malicious lawsuit? Was she protecting herself, with her reputation suddenly of concern when heretofore only her art seemed to matter? During the trial, this strong-willed woman turns to mush before our eyes. Conversely, her lover, who starts off as a narcissistic jerk, becomes a selfless hero during the trial. At least his motivation is clearer: he sacrifices himself for love.

{"value":"Lulu (Louise Brooks) works as a typist and is missing something in her life. She enters a Miss France contest against the wishes of her boyfriend Andre (Georges Charlia) and she wins. She sets off for the Miss Europe title leaving her boyfriend behind. She wins again but returns home to Andre because he has asked her to. Once back together, her life becomes mundane again so one night she writes a note to him and leaves to experience the fame that is waiting for her as Miss Europe. Andre follows her.....<br /><br />This film is a silent film with a piano music-track all the way through. It is also sped-up so everything seems fast. Limited dialogue has been added on afterwards and it is very phony. The cast are alright bearing in mind that it is a silent film. The best part of the film comes at the end but the story goes on a little too long. After watching this, I'm not really sure what the big deal was over the looks of Louise Brooks - she has a terrible haircut that makes her face look fat.

{"value":"Some of my old friends suggested me to watch this movie but I got chance only recently. I had high hopes of seeing something interesting from Kamal Hans, what I saw was bunch of garbage camera angles mixed at high speed. I could not understand what was the message except demeaning Hinduism. I am more like many religion type but I felt Kamal Hasan is a man low character to have orchestrated this kind of thought. He could have made a horror movie than this crap. He tried to add Hollywood genre of viruses and god forbid he did not convert that guy into a mutant and ultimately going to go for world domination. This is a much befitting movie for a film school vs regular public. Shame on him for not holding up to the talent he has. Starting of story tried Chaos to borrow ideas from Butterfly effect, then in between little religious harmony at the cost of insulting Hinduism (Once again I insult Hinduism more but this movie has no

{"value":"\"A scientist discovers signals from space that appear to carry information concerning a series of seemingly unrelated natural disasters, occurring across the globe. Hoping to discover the source of these signals and who's behind them, the scientist and his wife set out on a trek to locate the intended recipient of the signals. What the couple eventually discovers is a small remote convent with occupants who are not really who they appear to be,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />Kirk Scott (as Andrew Boran) is the scientist who intercepts alien messages on his computer. He suspects a series of \"Large Earth Disruptions\" may be connected to the weird space static. Mr. Scott and pretty blonde wife Sue Lyon (as Sylvia Boran) investigate the mysterious signals from outer space. They discover priestly, but creepy Christopher Lee (as \"Father Pergado\"), and other silliness.

{"value":"Okay this is gona be short and sweet review...Something the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life shorter and sweeter than it was.<br /><br />This movie is $^@%. There's a good reason there was a petition with over 40,000 + signatures ALL demanding Uwe Boll stop making movies from franchises people liked. Blood Rayne being a biggie there.<br /><br />The jokes are good...if you've never heard them a THOUSAND times before. THe acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that. I even a few moments wonder if they're even using a script.<br /><br />The movie has little to NOTHING to do with the original games. HELLO if you've played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular. There's way too much story for such a stupid movie. like I said. I WOULDN'T even steal this movie.

{"value":"i just happened to stumble on this film channel surfing. my first reaction was, 'oh god not again!'. it's so hip to play a retard these days it has become pretentious and frankly despicable. for some reason, though, i stayed and watched it 'til the end. maybe it was my faith in the actors, hoping they'd give me something to cheer about.<br /><br />and surely, ken and helena can act. also, the movie progresses into something better towards the end and actually does make a point.<br /><br />helena bonham carter also surprised me with her character. jane has a mean side that she uses to keep distance and repel pity. then again she has a soft side that's just looking for love. the only thing that surprised me even more was branagh's character...this was a triumph of acting, the movie itself is nothing unique.<br /><br />see if you are an acting student...if you're looking for pure entertainment you can skip this one. it's sean penn serious! oh my, that was a bit harsh it does

{"value":"I just rented (yes! I paid money to see!) this film. OMG. It is one of the very worst films I have ever seen. As another reviewer put it, Ms. Colagrande, get out of films, PLEASE! Please never make or appear in another film! The lady has the charisma of a cantaloupe. No, that's not fair to the cantaloupe, which probably has more going for it. She does not know how to act; she affects a disgusted look ALL the time (reminded me very much of my always-disgusted young sisters-in-law from Europe). She is not charming; she is not pretty. There is no real story. And the editing! There WASN'T any, that I could see! It's pretty bad when you are watching a film and, just to get through it, you press \"forward forward\" on your remote, and STILL nothing happens! I mean!..... I kept involuntarily screaming, \"Cut! Cut!\" What WERE they thinking? Well, obviously, they thought they would make a film together and get PAID to make love on screen! Pretty good deal for THEM; pretty raw deal for the viewer!

{"value":"had some lovely poetic bits but is really just an artsy-fartsy toss-together with no direction or resolution. how do these people get through film school? who gives them money to make this crap? could have been so much more, fine lead actor, and i always like Fairuza Balk, but come on, the alt-rock metaphor of just staring vacantly unable to find anything compelling is just so tired, and it sure doesn't make for good films. the director needs to go away and live life for a good long while and not come back to the camera until they really have something to say. this is like the throw-spaghetti-at-the-wall school of art-making, just juxtapose a bunch of earnest imagery and hope hope hope like hell that poetry emerges. that can work, if the director actually has any kind of vision, or has a brain that knows when it's in the presence of potential, but here it's just space filler, of no consequence. i felt the lazy ending coming moments before it hit, and was yelling \"you

{"value":"Did anyone edit this film? Or was it only the DVD release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes? It's OK though, I fell asleep watching it the first time. Then I fell asleep the second time and the third time. The plot is actually not the worst I've seen, but it's close. The acting is not the worst I've seen either...but it's close. The production .... well, I can honestly say that it was the worst I had ever seen in my life! Not trying to be spiteful, but Unhinged could have used some more production.<br /><br />Please don't think I'm a hater of horror films, or even that I didn't enjoy this film. I just felt I was laughing at the film much more than I felt I was laughing along with it. The gruesome moments were not too poorly done, but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget.<br /><br />Characters seemed awkwardly developed, or ignored all together, twist ending

{"value":"Movie industry is tricky business - because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life, too. That's the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an 'insightful' film about film. And indeed, no better proof of the industry's trickiness than seeing Anouk Aimée and Maximilian Schell trapped in this inanity. The insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like \"should I make a studio movie that pays a lot or should I make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self?\" \"Do the latter, please.\" Or: \"our relationship is not only professional, it's private as well. It's a rather complex situation to handle, isn't it?\" \"Yes, it is, my dear.\" Between the insipid dialogs one gets glimpses of palm trees, hotel lobbies and American movie posters (no sign of non-American film presence on the Croisette). Recurrent slumber sessions are inevitable, making the 100 minutes of the film feel like ages.

{"value":"A great slasher movie -- too bad it was the producers and not part of the script. Basic plot summary - man with redhead fetish goes invites such women to his flat only to go into some kind of freakish coma and proceeds in offing them to various degrees of success. Only the cutting crew behind the scenes must have thought the movie was as ad as I did and chopped the heck out of the movie. Nothing flows, you get lost on which redhead he is with at the time (didn't he off that one earlier??), and most of the time it looks like the camera man passed out and resumed filming when he awoke. Not that I can blame him I passed out 2-3 times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain what little plot that does exist. Warning when you see the ending DO NOT try to connect it with anything that happens before -- you will just get an aneurysm. Not worth the time, effort, or God forbid money.

{"value":"Lorne Michaels once again proves that he has absolutely no business producing movies.<br /><br />You'd think that after such dismal flicks \"Superstar\", \"Night at the Roxbury\", and \"Coneheads\", he'd start to get the notion that maybe he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to movies (and many would argue that he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to television, as well). Trying to make feature films out of skits that wore out their welcome the third time the were done on SNL makes no sense.<br /><br />I personally like Tim Meadows, and think that he would be great in the right movie. It's a shame to see a talented guy wasted in a film that features unfunny after unfunny situation, and caps it all with a dreadfully bad song and dance scene.
