{"value":"This story had a different angle that intrigued me, enough to buy a previously-viewed VHS sight-unseen. That was a mistake.<br /><br />In what could have been a very nice story - about badly crippled people at a hospital, and their various personalities - turned quickly into a very profane soap opera with unlikeable characters.<br /><br />We have \"Bloss\" (William Forsythe) the stereotype racist white person, who says the f-word every other sentence and is so despicable they didn't give him a first name in the movie. He's a lot of fun to be around. Then, there is \"Raymond Hill\" (Wesley Snipes), a fast-talking womanizer. Snipes must have liked those fast-talking \"hip\" arrogant roles because he played in a number of them, like in \"White Men Can't Jump.\" Then there is sweet Helen Hunt playing \"Anna\" that wonderful caring, loving person who is having an adulterous affair with the leading character in the film, \"Joel Garcia\" (Eric Stoltz).<br /><br />Yup, this is heartwarming, feel-good type stuff. It just makes my heart melt watching these nice folks. But, if you are one of those who loves sleazy characters portrayed by sleazy people in this sleazy film.....you might really like this! Add in a dose of Hollywood political correctness and there you go!

want?","finished_norm":["thi","stori","have","a","differ","angl","that","intrigu","me","enough","to","bui","a","previouslyview","vh","sightunseen","that","be","a","mistakebr","br","in","what","can","have","be","a","veri","nice","stori","about","badli","crippl","peopl","at","a","hospit","and","their","variou","person","turn","quickli","into","a","veri","profan","soap","opu","with","unlik","charactersbr","br","we","have","bloss","william","forsyth","the","stereotyp","racist","white","person","who","sai","the","fword","everi","other","sentenc","and","be","so","despic","thei","do","not","give","him","a","name","in","the","movi","he","a","lot","of","fun","to","be","around","then","there","be","raymond","hill","weslei","snipe","a","fasttalk","woman","snipe","must","have","like","that","fasttalk","hip","arrog","role","becaus","he","plai","in","a","numb","of","them","like","in","white","man","ca","not","jump","then","there","be","sweet","helen","hunt","plai","anna","that","wonder","care","love","person","who","be","have","a","adulter","affair","with","the","lead","charact","in","the","film","joel","garcia","eric","stoltzbr","br","yup","thi","be","heartwarm","feelgood","typ","stuff","it","just","make","my","heart","melt","watch","thi","nice","folk","but","if","you","be","on","of","that","who","love","sleazi","charact","portrai","by","sleazi","peopl","in","thi","sleazi","filmyou","mai","realli","like","thi","add","in","a","dose","of","hollywood","polit","correct","and","there","you","go","what","much","can","anyon","want"],"filtered":["thi","stori","differ","angl","intrigu","enough","bui","previouslyview","vh","sightunseen","mistakebr","br","veri","nice","stori","badli","crippl","peopl","hospit","variou","person","turn","quickli","veri","profan","soap","opu","unlik","charactersbr","br","bloss","william","forsyth","stereotyp","racist","white","person","sai","fword","everi","sentenc","despic","thei","give","name","movi","lot","fun","around","raymond","hill","weslei","snipe","fasttalk","woman","snipe","must","like","fasttalk","hip","arrog","role","becaus","plai","numb","like","white","man","ca","jump","sweet","helen","hunt","plai","anna","wonder","care","love","person","adulter","affair","lead","charact","film","joel","garcia","eric","stoltzbr","br","yup","thi","heartwarm","feelgood","typ","stuff","make","heart","melt","watch","thi","nice","folk","love","sleazi","charact","portrai","sleazi","peopl","thi","sleazi","filmyou","mai","realli","like","thi","add","dose","hollywood","polit","correct","go","much","anyon","want"],"filtered2":["stori","differ","angl","intrigu","enough","bui","previouslyview","vh","sightunseen","mistakebr","veri","nice","stori","badli","crippl","peopl","hospit","variou","person","turn","quickli","veri","profan","soap","opu","unlik","charactersbr","bloss","william","forsyth","stereotyp","racist","white","person","fword","everi","sentenc","despic","give","name","lot","fun","around","raymond","hill","weslei","snipe","fasttalk","woman","snipe","must","like","fasttalk","hip","arrog","role","becaus","plai","numb","like","white","man","ca","jump","sweet","helen","hunt","plai","anna","wonder","care","love","person","adulter","affair","lead","charact","joel","garcia","eric","stoltzbr","yup","heartwarm","feelgood","typ","stuff","make","heart","melt","watch","nice","folk","love","sleazi","charact","portrai","sleazi","peopl","sleazi","filmyou","mai","realli","like","add","dose","hollywood","polit","correct","go","anyon","want"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,10,13,15,17,22,23,30,37,40,45,46,54,70,72,81,85,93,96,98,128,141,143,153,157,158,175,204,205,259,262,299,300,347,359,361,384,448,469,516,575,604,614,615,674,720,770,942,1008,1017,1018,1143,1200,1201,1249,1293,1343,1388,1466,1877,1924,1978,1991,2134,2181,2224,2227,2363,3008,3082,3101,3272,3497,4273,4275,4563,4875,5853,6237,6251,6362,6381,6999,7102,7164,7956],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,7,10,13,15,17,22,23,30,37,40,45,46,54,70,72,81,85,93,96,98,128,141,143,153,157,158,175,204,205,259,262,299,300,347,359,361,384,448,469,516,575,604,614,615,674,720,770,942,1008,1017,1018,1143,1200,1201,1249,1293,1343,1388,1466,1877,1924,1978,1991,2134,2181,2224,2227,2363,3008,3082,3101,3272,3497,4273,4275,4563,4875,5853,6237,6251,6362,6381,6999,7102,7164,7956],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9381148836729736,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.1317941569733974,2.4001215597131385,2.5541073880211935,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,1.3364419891718522,1.4876543214774305,3.2569937516641474,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,3.6227786505458823,2.094

{"value":"When anyone comes into a film of this type of film it's not without saying that an overdose of that great over-the-counter brain-medicine, Suspension of Disbelief, comes in mighty handy.<br /><br />Jeanette MacDonald plays two roles: Anna/Brigitta, the woman who Nelson Eddy has ignored since the beginning of time, but who also is -- an angel sent to Earth.<br /><br />My reaction when I saw this was a mute gasp of \"Hunh?\" Where have I seen this before? It turns out, I have seen it before, but in a movie made much later than this one. DATE WITH AN ANGEL, a forgettable pile of dreck made in 1987, cashed in on the ethereal beauty of one Emmanuelle Beart who had no speaking lines, also wore a blond wig, and made life hell for soap-actor Michael Knight. Much worse in every conceivable angle with ultra-low 80s values but more than likely an updated version of this 1942 turkey.<br /><br />Anyway, not to elaborate, this is not a memorable film and stands as a doorstop of information because it was the last time MacDonald and Eddy, neither very good actors but terrific singers, would be together playing up the \"innocence\" and \"clean-cut\" romance that they were known for. After that you may need a cold shower, not because there are any steamy scenes here, but to get rid of the memory.","finished_norm":["when","anyon","come","into","a","film","of","thi","typ","of","film","it","not","without","sai","that","a","overdos","of","that","great","overthecount","brainmedicin","suspens","of","disbelief","come","in","mighti","handybr","br","jeanett","macdonald","plai","two","role","annabrigitta","the","woman","who","nelson","eddi","have","ignor","sinc","the","begin","of","time","but","who","conjur","be","a","angel","send","to","earthbr","br","my","reaction","when","i","see","thi","be","a","mute","gasp","of","hunh","where","have","i","see","thi","befor","it","turn","out","i","have","see","it","befor","but","in","a","movi","make","much","late","than","thi","on","date","with","a","angel","a","forgett","pile","of","dreck","make","in","cash","in","on","the","ether","beauti","of","on","emmanuel","beart","who","have","no","speak","line","conjur","wear","a","blond","wig","and","make","life","hell","for","soapactor","michael","knight","much","wrong","in","everi","conceiv","angl","with","ultralow","valu","but","much","than","like","a","updat","version","of","thi","turkeybr","br","anywai","not","to","elabor","thi","be","not","a","memor","film","and","stand","a","a","doorstop","of","inform","becaus","it","be","the","last","time","macdonald","and","eddi","neither","veri","good","actor","but","terrif","singer","would","be","togeth","plai","up","the","innoc","and","cleancut","romanc","that","thei","be","know","for","after","that","you","mai","ne","a","cold","shower","not","becaus","there","be","ani","steami","scene","here","but","to","get","rid","of","the","memori"],"filtered":["anyon","come","film","thi","typ","film","without","sai","overdos","great","overthecount","brainmedicin","suspens","disbelief","come","mighti","handybr","br","jeanett","macdonald","plai","two","role","annabrigitta","woman","nelson","eddi","ignor","sinc","begin","time","conjur","angel","send","earthbr","br","reaction","see","thi","mute","gasp","hunh","see","thi","befor","turn","see","befor","movi","make","much","late","thi","date","angel","forgett","pile","dreck","make","cash","ether","beauti","emmanuel","beart","speak","line","conjur","wear","blond","wig","make","life","hell","soapactor","michael","knight","much","wrong","everi","conceiv","angl","ultralow","valu","much","like","updat","version","thi","turkeybr","br","anywai","elabor","thi","memor","film","stand","doorstop","inform","becaus","last","time","macdonald","eddi","neither","veri","good","actor","terrif","singer","togeth","plai","innoc","cleancut","romanc","thei","know","mai","ne","cold","shower","becaus","ani","steami","scene","get","rid","memori"],"filtered2":["anyon","come","typ","without","overdos","great","overthecount","brainmedicin","suspens","disbelief","come","mighti","handybr","jeanett","macdonald","plai","two","role","annabrigitta","woman","nelson","eddi","ignor","sinc","begin","time","conjur","angel","send","earthbr","reaction","see","mute","gasp","hunh","see","befor","turn","see","befor","make","late","date","angel","forgett","pile","dreck","make","cash","ether","beauti","emmanuel","beart","speak","line","conjur","wear","blond","wig","make","life","hell","soapactor","michael","knight","wrong","everi","conceiv","angl","ultralow","valu","like","updat","version","turkeybr","anywai","elabor","memor","stand","doorstop","inform","becaus","last","time","macdonald","eddi","neither","veri","good","actor","terrif","singer","togeth","plai","innoc","cleancut","romanc","know","mai","ne","cold","shower","becaus","ani","steami","scene","get","rid","memori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,8,15,19,22,25,26,27,34,39,40,41,46,47,51,70,75,79,85,96,107,110,125,128,144,147,150,158,162,220,270,325,344,377,384,386,394,451,466,514,529,647,718,721,762,892,985,1036,1043,1068,1074,1106,1133,1153,1293,1336,1391,1453,1454,1619,1780,1821,2233,2359,2475,2505,2538,2590,2703,2929,3036,3079,3624,3946,5590,6866,6991,7670],"values":[3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,8,15,19,22,25,26,27,34,39,40,41,46,47,51,70,75,79,85,96,107,110,125,128,144,147,150,158,162,220,270,325,344,377,384,386,394,451,466,514,529,647,718,721,762,892,985,1036,1043,1068,1074,1106,1133,1153,1293,1336,1391,1453,1454,1619,1780,1821,2233,2359,2475,2505,2538,2590,2703,2929,3036,3079,3624,3946,5590,6866,6991,7670],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.8837873718108231,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,2.5958480334723544,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,2.7965700178917925,3.1077880109725475,3.2569937516641474,1.5687599167621034,1.655771293751733,1.7064694353107215,1.7139

{"value":"This delectable fusion of New Age babble and luridly bad film-making may not \"open\" you up, to borrow one of the film's favorite verbs, but it might leave your jaw slack and your belly sore from laughter or retching. Based on the best-selling book by James Redfield, first (self) published in 1993, this cornucopia of kitsch tracks the spiritual awakening of an American history teacher (Matthew Settle) who, on traveling to deepest, darkest, phoniest Peru and sniffing either the air or something else more illegal. Namely what he discovers is a schlock Shangri La populated by smiling zombies who may be nuts or just heavily medicated, perhaps because they're often accompanied by a panpipe flourish and an occasional shout out from a celestial choir. Although there's a lot of talk about \"energy,\" that quality is decidedly missing from the motley cast whose numbers include Thomas Kretschmann, Annabeth Gish, Hector Elizondo and Jurgen Prochnow, all of whom are now firmly ensconced in the camp pantheon. For those who care, the plot involves the military, terrorists and the Roman Catholic Church; Armand Mastroianni provided the inept direction while Mr. Redfield, Barnet Bain and Dan Gordon wrote the hoot of a script.

{"value":"I'll admit that I don't expect much from a Roger Corman film. Generally, I expect a lot of walking and bad scripts. Yet in this case, I am pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The Gunslinger is a story of a woman (played by the spunky Beverly Garland) who takes over as sheriff after her husband is brutally murdered. Ms. Garland is a pretty good shot herself, killing one of the murderers the next day at her husband's funeral. Her first task is to shut down the local bar that is violating the town curfew. The bar's owner is trying to buy land in anticipation of being bought out by the (hoped-for) railroad. However, Ms. Garland is a thorn in her plans, and the bar matron hires a man to kill Ms. Garland.<br /><br />Because of Ms. Garland's plays her role honestly and realistically, there is absolutely no temptation to go to Suzanne Somers \"She's the Sheriff\" jokes. With the exception of a couple of faux pas (the apartment door that opens OUT from the inside, jeep tracks, and the two horsemen waiting on screen for their cue to ride around a corner), the movie becomes quite passable as movie fare. However, Corman could not resist padding his film with horse riding scenes, much like he does walking in other films.<br /><br />Sterno says The Gunslinger is a horse opera worth your

{"value":"Revenge of the Sith starts out with a long action sequence that is impressive without being terribly exciting, then gets really boring for the next hour and fifteen minutes, with the same horrible dialogue and dull machinations that have plagued the rest of the prequel series. The only thing that improves the proceedings is the slow--and I mean slow--build-up to what we know will be the birth of Darth Vader. And when that finally comes, it's pretty all right. Not great. Not even good. But pretty all right. This movie is being vastly over-praised because it does not suck to high heaven like the previous sequels. Instead it's just turgid, dull, and routine. But you have to say, wow, those CGI environments are really impressive at times. Bu the lightsabre fights? They're all a blurry mess. I think the dark side took hold of Lucas when he started these prequels and no one noticed. This will make a ton of money, but thank god it's over, this once-worshipped franchise has been beaten down enough. I saw the 12:01 show, and after it, I heard a group of very small kids say, wow that was awesome! But everyone older than eight all grumbled the same thing: I fell asleep in the middle.

{"value":"I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me.<br /><br />I watched several documentaries about him. He is obviously an intelligent man, with great knowledge about films and passion for making them, but does this makes him a good director. Definitely NO! A complete anti-talent. He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits, but a film with actors  never!<br /><br />He can't direct nor write. His screenplays are full of badly thought out situations, and many situations/dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word \"art\" in any sense. No way. Not to mention the unskillful direction, so amateurish-like. To say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie.<br /><br />Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store. WHO IS HE KIDDING?<br /><br />He is a cheater; he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want. He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising.

{"value":"I noticed with some amusement that in the end credits, the Detroit PD is thanked for their participation. The Chief of Police even has one speaking line playing himself (and boy, can you tell he can't act). The reason for the amusement is that in this movie the police shoot first and ask questions later. Not the kind of PR, I would think a police force would want. Other than that, this is your standard cops and robbers film dressed up for the '70's with a racial angle. Alex Rocco is given a thankless role of a lifer cop that can't get ahead and is saddled with a mentally ill wife. He makes up for this by hanging out at the local whorehouse. Hari Rhodes is his dashing partner that has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase after suspects while wearing a trenchcoat. The movie moves along until the penultimate shootout that makes absolutely no sense (why do people that are only guilty of a robbery, take on a whole police force?). Not only do we see one shootout but since there are four bad guys, we get to see four. Then there is a twist ending that is supposed to leave one guessing what really would have happened but only left me thinking how stupid it was.

{"value":"A bad rip-off attempt on \"Seven\", complete with sub-second-grade acting, awful camera work, half-baked story and strong aftertaste of lame propaganda. Yeah, them \"sex offenders\", they live next door and you're gonna get raped, really.<br /><br />No surprises from the vice-terminatrix woman, she acts as always -- as convincingly as a piece of wood. Richard Gere keeps on sliding lower and lower -- and is about as low here as a late Steven Seagal.<br /><br />The singer woman with the crazy eyes is best when she's dead in bed; and even the wolf was sub-par (although she was the best performer in the movie) -- maybe they fed her before the shots, or something.<br /><br />Unlike \"Seven\", which had a (made up, but interesting) story, to which one could relate more or less regardless of the country, this movie seems to focus on a US-only obsession. If one doesn't care much about \"sex offenders\" -- and the statistics are that lack of exercise and bad diet cause more pain, suffering and death -- there is little reason to see it, or to be

{"value":"The plot is plausible but banal, i.e., beautiful and neglected wife of wealthy and powerful man has a fling with a psychotic hunk, then tries to cover it up as the psycho stalks and blackmails her. But, what develops from there is stupefyingly illogical. Despite the resources that are available to the usual couple who has money and influence, our privileged hero and heroine appear to have only one domestic, their attorney and local police (who say they can do nothing) at their disposal while they grapple with suspense and terror. They have no private security staff (only a fancy security system that they mishandle), household or grounds staff, chauffeurs, etc. Not even, apparently, the funds to hire private round-the-clock nurses to care for the hero when he suffers life-threatening injuries, leaving man and wife alone and vulnerable in their mansion. Our heroine is portrayed as having the brains of a doorknob and our hero, a tycoon, behaves in the most unlikely and irrational manner. The production is an insult to viewers who wasted their time with this drivel and a crime for having wasted the talents of veteran actors Oliva Hussey and Don Murray (what were they thinking?). And, shame on Lifetime TV for insulting the intelligence of its audience for this insipid offering.","finished_norm":["the","plot","be","plausibl","but","banal","ie","beauti","and","neglect","wife","of","wealthi","and","power","man","have","a","fling","with","a","psychot","hunk","then","try","to","cover","it","up","a","the","psycho","stalk","and","blackmail","her","but","what","develop","from","there","be","stupefyingli","illog","despit","the","resourc","that","be","avail","to","the","usual","coupl","who","have","monei","and","influenc","our","privileg","hero","and","heroin","appear","to","have","onli","on","domest","their","attornei","and","local","polic","who","sai","thei","can","do","noth","at","their","dispos","while","thei","grappl","with","suspens","and","terror","thei","have","no","privat","secur","staff","onli","a","fanci","secur","system","that","thei","mishandl","household","or","ground","staff","chauffeur","etc","not","even","appar","the","fund","to","hire","privat","roundtheclock","nurs","to","care","for","the","hero","when","he","suffer","lifethreaten","injuri","leav","man","and","wife","alon","and","vulner","in","their","mansion","our","heroin","be","portrai","a","have","the","brain","of","a","doorknob","and","our","hero","a","tycoon","behav","in","the","much","unlik","and","irrat","manner","the","product","be","a","insult","to","viewer","who","wast","their","time","with","thi","drivel","and","a","crime","for","have","wast","the","talent","of","veteran","actor","oliva","hussei","and","don","murrai","what","be","thei","think","and","shame","on","lifetim","tv","for","insult","the","intellig","of","it","audienc","for","thi","insipid","offer"],"filtered":["plot","plausibl","banal","ie","beauti","neglect","wife","wealthi","power","man","fling","psychot","hunk","try","cover","psycho","stalk","blackmail","develop","stupefyingli","illog","despit","resourc","avail","usual","coupl","monei","influenc","privileg","hero","heroin","appear","onli","domest","attornei","local","polic","sai","thei","noth","dispos","thei","grappl","suspens","terror","thei","privat","secur","staff","onli","fanci","secur","system","thei","mishandl","household","ground","staff","chauffeur","etc","even","appar","fund","hire","privat","roundtheclock","nurs","care","hero","suffer","lifethreaten","injuri","leav","man","wife","alon","vulner","mansion","heroin","portrai","brain","doorknob","hero","tycoon","behav","much","unlik","irrat","manner","product","insult","viewer","wast","time","thi","drivel","crime","wast","talent","veteran","actor","oliva","hussei","murrai","thei","think","shame","lifetim","tv","insult","intellig","audienc","thi","insipid","offer"],"filtered2":["plot","plausibl","banal","ie","beauti","neglect","wife","wealthi","power","man","fling","psychot","hunk","try","cover","psycho","stalk","blackmail","develop","stupefyingli","illog","despit","resourc","avail","usual","coupl","monei","influenc","privileg","hero","heroin","appear","onli","domest","attornei","local","polic","noth","dispos","grappl","suspens","terror","privat","secur","staff","onli","fanci","secur","system","mishandl","household","ground","staff","chauffeur","etc","even","appar","fund","hire","privat","roundtheclock","nurs","care","hero","suffer","lifethreaten","injuri","leav","man","wife","alon","vulner","mansion","heroin","portrai","brain","doorknob","hero","tycoon","behav","unlik","irrat","manner","product","insult","viewer","wast","time","drivel","crime","wast","talent","veteran","actor","oliva","hussei","murrai","think","shame","lifetim","tv","insult","intellig","audienc","insipid","offer"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,8,11,12,32,36,41,45,49,74,89,126,168,170,172,190,205,253,263,265,276,279,308,320,325,365,375,391,429,457,469,471,475,491,507,529,574,603,615,633,673,709,753,1014,1046,1308,1310,1354,1416,1448,1586,1649,1689,1725,1792,1840,1901,1941,2041,2091,2126,2234,2272,2469,2614,2675,2690,2705,2726,2773,3044,3109,3135,3596,3619,3783,4019,4249,4266,4673,5124,5509,5565,5615,6679,7395],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,8,11,12,32,36,41,45,49,74,89,126,168,170,172,190,205,253,263,265,276,279,308,320,325,365,375,391,429,457,469,471,475,491,507,529,574,603,615,633,673,709,753,1014,1046,1308,1310,1354,1416,1448,1586,1649,1689,1725,1792,1840,1901,1941,2041,2091,2126,2234,2272,2469,2614,2675,2690,2705,2726,2773,3044,3109,3135,3596,3619,3783,4019,4249,4266,4673,5124,5509,5565,5615,6679,7395],"values":[0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,3.632592212924433,1.6920303308087352,1.9486336368009016,3.9880092219144876,2.2391270689902285,2.4894767118610357,2.4214486257841834,2.50014089

{"value":"Identical twin sisters Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen climbed to fame in sitcoms like \"Two of a Kind\", I had never seen them in anything before, but I had an idea of what to expect, but it was much worse. Basically the Hunter sisters Charli (Mary-Kate) and Leila (Ashley) are in Rome for a Summer Intern Program, but not long after starting their jobs they are immediately fired for a series of mishaps. But the man who owns the company they are working in, Derek Hammond (Julian Stone), gives them their jobs back, and they they do slowly prove themselves useful assets, and talented (fashion) artists, and help stop a mean man taking over the company. Also starring Leslie Danon as Jami, Derek Lee Nixon as Ryan, Ilenia Lazzarin as Dari, Archie Kao as Nobu, Valentina Mattolini as Heidi, Michelangelo Tommaso as Paolo and Matt Patresi as Enrico Tortoni. You can tell that this film was made to go straight to video, the camera-work is completely mismatched, and it doesn't help when you want to admire the sights of Rome. In fact the background is the only good thing to watch, the twin sisters are two of the most annoying celebrities around, I knew before watching that they weren't going to interest me in any way (their not even that pretty), this is awful gush of rubbish film.

{"value":"As you may or may not have heard, there is no actual fighting between vampires or zombies in this film. One may then ask why the title suggested such a thing, but really it's kind of appropriate because nothing else about this film made any sense either. There was absolutely no story or plot, just things happening. The acting was incredibly bad, worse than safeauto commercials bad.<br /><br />Not only were there no fighting between vampires and zombies but I think there was only one scene with zombies even in it. Their make up looked as if it were applied by an 8 year old girl. The scene was totally random and out of place and featured one of the characters fighting the zombies off with a hedge trimmer (I'm not kidding) but they used chainsaw sound effects.<br /><br />This was undoubtedly the poorest movie I've ever seen in my life. The only circumstance that I wouldn't totally ridicule every person responsible for production of this film is if I learned that it was produced entirely by 11 year old's.<br /><br />Really though, even with all of the criticism I offer here, I'd suggest watching this movie solely based on the fact that it may very well be the worst movie ever, and because of this is quite comical. Even just counting the flaws in it should keep you entertained.","finished_norm":["a","you","mai","or","mai","not","have","hear","there","be","no","actual","fight","between","vampir","or","zombi","in","thi","film","on","mai","then","ask","why","the","titl","suggest","such","a","thing","but","realli","it","kind","of","appropri","becaus","noth","els","about","thi","film","make","ani","sens","either","there","be","absolut","no","stori","or","plot","just","thing","happen","the","act","be","incredibli","bad","wrong","than","safeauto","commerci","badbr","br","not","onli","be","there","no","fight","between","vampir","and","zombi","but","i","think","there","be","onli","on","scene","with","zombi","even","in","it","their","make","up","look","a","if","it","be","appli","by","a","year","old","girl","the","scene","be","total","random","and","out","of","place","and","featur","on","of","the","charact","fight","the","zombi","off","with","a","hedg","trim","i","be","not","kid","but","thei","us","chainsaw","sound","effectsbr","br","thi","be","undoubtedli","the","poor","movi","i","have","ever","see","in","my","life","the","onli","circumst","that","i","would","not","total","ridicul","everi","person","respons","for","product","of","thi","film","be","if","i","learn","that","it","be","produc","entir","by","year","oldsbr","br","realli","though","even","with","all","of","the","critic","i","offer","here","i","have","suggest","watch","thi","movi","sole","base","on","the","fact","that","it","mai","veri","good","be","the","wrong","movi","ever","and","becaus","of","thi","be","quit","comic","even","just","count","the","flaw","in","it","should","keep","you","entertain"],"filtered":["mai","mai","hear","actual","fight","vampir","zombi","thi","film","mai","ask","titl","suggest","thing","realli","kind","appropri","becaus","noth","els","thi","film","make","ani","sens","either","absolut","stori","plot","thing","happen","act","incredibli","bad","wrong","safeauto","commerci","badbr","br","onli","fight","vampir","zombi","think","onli","scene","zombi","even","make","look","appli","year","old","girl","scene","total","random","place","featur","charact","fight","zombi","hedg","trim","kid","thei","us","chainsaw","sound","effectsbr","br","thi","undoubtedli","poor","movi","ever","see","life","onli","circumst","total","ridicul","everi","person","respons","product","thi","film","learn","produc","entir","year","oldsbr","br","realli","though","even","critic","offer","suggest","watch","thi","movi","sole","base","fact","mai","veri","good","wrong","movi","ever","becaus","thi","quit","comic","even","count","flaw","keep","entertain"],"filtered2":["mai","mai","hear","actual","fight","vampir","zombi","mai","ask","titl","suggest","thing","realli","kind","appropri","becaus","noth","els","make","ani","sens","either","absolut","stori","plot","thing","happen","act","incredibli","bad","wrong","safeauto","commerci","badbr","onli","fight","vampir","zombi","think","onli","scene","zombi","even","make","look","appli","year","old","girl","scene","total","random","place","featur","charact","fight","zombi","hedg","trim","kid","us","chainsaw","sound","effectsbr","undoubtedli","poor","ever","see","life","onli","circumst","total","ridicul","everi","person","respons","product","learn","produc","entir","year","oldsbr","realli","though","even","critic","offer","suggest","watch","sole","base","fact","mai","veri","good","wrong","ever","becaus","quit","comic","even","count","flaw","keep","entertain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,7,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,19,21,22,25,27,29,32,44,46,49,52,56,57,67,75,84,85,86,94,97,114,120,122,134,146,153,164,173,178,184,190,195,196,198,207,216,222,233,261,264,268,274,305,306,334,431,480,485,507,579,646,687,859,885,915,923,1126,1467,1629,1748,1859,2352,3271,3699,5883,6806],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,7,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,19,21,22,25,27,29,32,44,46,49,52,56,57,67,75,84,85,86,94,97,114,120,122,134,146,153,164,173,178,184,190,195,196,198,207,216,222,233,261,264,268,274,305,306,334,431,480,485,507,579,646,687,859,885,915,923,1126,1467,1629,1748,1859,2352,3271,3699,5883,6806],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,2.7780513171783934,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,2.9739294460164585,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,2.62476135602347,1.162015545335049,2.5958480334723544,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,2.6390769554676132,1.3711311285073675,3.209458785004948,6.623085175006932,1.6920303308087352,1.7122153074726136,1.8610609350701788,3.668325173349496,1.9570915389266579,1.9742250248702675,2.2212694515902225,2.011190219103739,2.0

{"value":"The film is pretty confusing and ludicrous. The plot is awful...but on the plus side the acting is pretty good, with a few good shouts and rants. Sharon stone is OK this time...not even half as good as the original mind you. The murders aren't as gory as the first one either, which is a shame. Its not the unpredictable mess everyone say it is though. The sex is pretty graphic at times while others it is clear it is fake (they are fully clothed). The script is weak most of the time, but the scenes with banter and arguments between Dr.Glass and Washburn are highlights. The plot twists a few times, but the ending is awful. The tension is always constant with a huge dollop of 'Oh my god!'. The chase sequences are brilliantly directed, and shots and camera angles are impressive and bring a bit of class to an otherwise, rush-felt film. Sharon stone is a bit old for this too. The bits where we see her breasts were, in the first one, delights. This time around, they are too horrid to describe. The films its self is rather average, but it is worth a go. Mainly because the film does deserve some good buzz...with the opening sequence being a highlight. Not to be critical, but if you liked the first one - leave this one. Don't ruin the run.

{"value":"Utter dreck. I got to the 16 minute/27 second point, and gave up. I'd have given it a negative number review if that were possible (although 'pissible' is a more fitting word...). Unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original, the chemistry between dumb ol' Dicky Crenna and whats-her-face here is just non-existent. The anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet? There's no ciggy-lighting-by-fingertip? And I thought I'd be SICK when they have a mortified-looking (and rightly so, believe you me) Lee J. Cobb as Keyes practically burping/upchucking his way through the explanation of his \"Little Man\" to Mr. Garloupis. No offence to the non-sighted, but it looks as though a posse of blind men ran amuck with the set design of both the Dietrichson and Neff houses. The same goes for those horrid plaid pants that Phyllis wears. And crikey, how much $$ does Neff make, that he lives overlooking a huge marina? This, folks, again, all takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes. If you can get through more of it, you have a much stronger constitution than me, or you are a masochist.

{"value":"Ever since I started visiting this site, and voting for movies, I have never given any movie a rating of 1. Even the disturbing \"Dance! Workout with Barbie\" got a 2. There is a reason for this.<br /><br />Any time I find myself watching what I think is a really bad movie, I have to stop and ask myself the following question: \"Is this movie really as bad as the horrific soul-sucking beast that is 'Theodore Rex'?\" And I've never been able to answer \"yes\".<br /><br />I would give anything within reason to know what crackhead said \"Hey! Let's remake 'Blade Runner' with Barney in the Harrison Ford Role!\" and decided it was a good idea to actually spend the time and money to commit it to film. Furthermore, I want to know what the hell kind of market they were going to sell this towards if it hadn't gone strait to video. This is that rare monster: a movie that is way too violent for kids and way too insanely stupid for adults. I'd ask \"what were they THINKING?\" but in this case, it might actually be redundant.<br /><br />Anyhow, all you need to know is that you should only expose yourself to this monstrosity if you're one

{"value":"Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this at this very moment, and I find this movie appalling. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: \"They are doing all this for a man!?\" <br /><br />I find these women have no intensity, no sense of the a fight between tragedy and identity, and that these men are hardly worth fighting for. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them over, the men look stupid more than admiring.<br /><br />Japanese people have much more intensity than Chinese people, and being geisha is Japanese culture. I am sure the Chinese had something similar, but the faces do not match the main.<br /><br />Anyway, the dialogue is so unmysterious, so American. Had a European done it with European orientals, they would have done a far better job.<br /><br />I have to add: it seems most of the people who liked the film are American. Sorry to say, but no wonder. All spelt out for you, not instinctive, not passionate. I think the Chinese actresses are lovely, but I could not say they were good actors in this film. Yes, the cinematography is great, but really, I cannot see how it can be seen that these characters are complex, deep individuals.<br /><br />I'm going to Japan to see the real thing.

{"value":"I am writing this review having watched it several months ago....the trailer looked promising enough for me to buy this lame excuse for a movie. It is a complete joke....and literally a spit in the face of real classics of the early generation of horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) which they even had the gall to compare itself to on the back of the cover art. The producer who played Brandon should go flip burgers and serve up greasy hamburgers....hell he might not even be good at that either! The lighting was bad bad bad and a big annoyance through out the film you couldn't even see the actor's faces sometimes. I don't even remember the rest of the cast members which is sad really, bad they never do anything to impress you to make them memorable. That's all the time I will waste on this review PLEASE stay as far away as you can from this pile of junk even if you get it for 25 cents don't do it buy s piece of gum at least IT would keep you entertained!<br /><br />If you want good quality low budget fun, far better than this... then check out a Jeff Hayes film....because it takes talent to make it in horror and the kid has it!<br /><br

{"value":"I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke (as Jill), who I had meet briefly in LA at a modeling trade show, in her first feature film. I was hoping to see more of her, but thought she did very well acting her role. Since she is such a beautiful and poised TV host, and model, it was not surprising. I was left wondering why she was killed, and what happened as a result. Maybe I just missed it.<br /><br />I wasn't really sure about the genre of this movie, and although I liked the actors I felt like it was for a college audience. I tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasn't my favorite genre, but felt like I had outgrown the gags. It seemed to drag out in some places, leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had, and, like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending.<br /><br />Having written a couple of scripts, I know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions, how many movies you have seen & studied, and those you relate with at a point in time.<br /><br />In a nutshell, I found it interesting, but not a satisfying plot and ending for me. If Jill (Brooke Burke) would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyone's ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","movi","primarili","to","see","brook","burk","a","jill","who","i","have","meet","briefli","in","la","at","a","model","trade","show","in","her","featur","film","i","be","hope","to","see","much","of","her","but","think","she","do","veri","good","act","her","role","sinc","she","be","such","a","beauti","and","pois","tv","host","and","model","it","be","not","surpris","i","be","leav","wonder","why","she","be","kill","and","what","happen","a","a","result","mayb","i","just","miss","itbr","br","i","be","not","realli","sure","about","the","genr","of","thi","movi","and","although","i","like","the","actor","i","feel","like","it","be","for","a","colleg","audienc","i","try","to","keep","a","open","mind","consid","horror","be","not","my","favorit","genr","but","feel","like","i","have","outgrow","the","gag","it","seem","to","drag","out","in","some","place","leav","you","guess","in","some","place","about","what","power","the","evil","professor","have","and","like","a","lot","of","other","film","have","a","unsatisfi","endingbr","br","have","write","a","coupl","of","script","i","know","a","lot","of","thi","be","difficult","and","mai","come","down","to","person","opinion","how","mani","movi","you","have","see","studi","and","that","you","relat","with","at","a","point","in","timebr","br","in","a","nutshel","i","find","it","interest","but","not","a","satisfi","plot","and","end","for","me","if","jill","brook","burk","would","have","return","through","the","portal","in","the","end","and","kick","everyon","ass","that","would","be","a","satisfi","end","and","would","earn","a","high","rate"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","primarili","see","brook","burk","jill","meet","briefli","la","model","trade","show","featur","film","hope","see","much","think","veri","good","act","role","sinc","beauti","pois","tv","host","model","surpris","leav","wonder","kill","happen","result","mayb","miss","itbr","br","realli","sure","genr","thi","movi","although","like","actor","feel","like","colleg","audienc","try","keep","open","mind","consid","horror","favorit","genr","feel","like","outgrow","gag","seem","drag","place","leav","guess","place","power","evil","professor","like","lot","film","unsatisfi","endingbr","br","write","coupl","script","know","lot","thi","difficult","mai","come","person","opinion","mani","movi","see","studi","relat","point","timebr","br","nutshel","find","interest","satisfi","plot","end","jill","brook","burk","return","portal","end","kick","everyon","ass","satisfi","end","earn","high","rate"],"filtered2":["see","primarili","see","brook","burk","jill","meet","briefli","la","model","trade","show","featur","hope","see","think","veri","good","act","role","sinc","beauti","pois","tv","host","model","surpris","leav","wonder","kill","happen","result","mayb","miss","itbr","realli","sure","genr","although","like","actor","feel","like","colleg","audienc","try","keep","open","mind","consid","horror","favorit","genr","feel","like","outgrow","gag","seem","drag","place","leav","guess","place","power","evil","professor","like","lot","unsatisfi","endingbr","write","coupl","script","know","lot","difficult","mai","come","person","opinion","mani","see","studi","relat","point","timebr","nutshel","find","interest","satisfi","plot","end","jill","brook","burk","return","portal","end","kick","everyon","ass","satisfi","end","earn","high","rate"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,12,13,15,21,24,26,28,32,34,35,36,38,41,43,46,50,60,65,66,72,74,76,77,83,94,119,128,134,153,162,163,164,168,172,175,181,202,211,237,238,242,243,246,253,255,305,317,321,325,326,350,365,430,447,467,488,538,764,766,803,814,822,869,903,998,1105,1171,1250,1660,1685,1751,2045,2124,2358,2728,2801,3130,3409,3901,4173,4509,4615],"values":[4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,12,13,15,21,24,26,28,32,34,35,36,38,41,43,46,50,60,65,66,72,74,76,77,83,94,119,128,134,153,162,163,164,168,172,175,181,202,211,237,238,242,243,246,253,255,305,317,321,325,326,350,365,430,447,467,488,538,764,766,803,814,822,869,903,998,1105,1171,1250,1660,1685,1751,2045,2124,2358,2728,2801,3130,3409,3901,4173,4509,4615],"values":[2.5841531782306313,2.6228008218775787,0.6786144649922705,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,3.9631084698357775,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,3.321622407243643,1.655771293751733,1.717994385570355,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,3.841892750832105,3.8972672736018033,2.1337665533324026,1.9463902258768238,2.29231879774

{"value":"If I hadn't been forced to watch this for work reasons I never would have made it past the first 10 minutes. And even then I admit I fast forwarded through parts. The '63 film version was vastly superior in all regards. Yes, I've read this one is more faithful to the original play, but what a wise thing it was for the writer to change the script in '63! It's overlong, it drags, the songs that are in this version and not in the film version are boring and unimaginative. The version of \"Kids\" in the '63 version was very funny and a true classic of sarcastic parent humor. In this version the Kim is way too old, the Conrad is *absolutely horrible* to behold (when someone ripped his shirt off him I shuttered in disgust...the director of this version has no idea what sexy is.). This Conrad can't dance, can't sing (he can't even stay in tune) and is simply repulsive. If Elvis Presley had really been like that his career would have been over before it began. As for the other actors, well I kept waiting for Alexander's toupee to fall off as he danced and Daly was totally over acting as Momma.

{"value":"I have a 5 minute rule (sometimes I'll leave leway for 10). If a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes it's probably not going to ever get better. I have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory. Dan in Real Life is definitely no exception. I was watching this turkey and thought; wow, this is not funny, not touching, not sad, and I don't like any of the characters at all.<br /><br />The story of an advice columnist/widower raising three young daughters, who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend. I suppose the tagline would be \"advice columnist who could USE advice\"? I don't know. Dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice. I guess THAT'S the irony? I don't know. He goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat, which seems very sweet, and potential fodder for good comedy, story lines...none which ever emerge. The central story is basically how he loves this woman, but can't have her. Anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he WILL get her, but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny, trite, lifetime movie network dialogue \"murderer of love\" to get to the inevitable happy ending.<br /><br />This is truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.","finished_norm":["i","have","a","minut","rule","sometim","i","will","leav","lewai","for","if","a","movi","be","not","good","in","the","or","minut","it","probabl","not","go","to","ever","get","well","i","have","yet","to","experi","ani","movi","that","have","prove","to","contest","thi","theori","dan","in","real","life","be","definit","no","except","i","be","watch","thi","turkei","and","think","wow","thi","be","not","funni","not","touch","not","sad","and","i","do","not","like","ani","of","the","charact","at","allbr","br","the","stori","of","a","advic","columnistwidow","rais","three","young","daughter","who","fall","in","love","with","hi","brother","girlfriend","i","suppos","the","taglin","would","be","advic","columnist","who","can","us","advic","i","do","not","know","dan","charact","in","no","wai","strike","me","a","someon","qualifi","to","give","advic","i","guess","that","the","ironi","i","do","not","know","he","go","to","see","hi","parent","brother","sister","and","their","kid","at","some","sort","of","anual","famili","retreat","which","seem","veri","sweet","and","potenti","fodder","for","good","comedi","stori","linesnon","which","ever","emerg","the","central","stori","be","basic","how","he","love","thi","woman","but","ca","not","have","her","anyon","with","a","puls","will","realis","that","eventu","he","will","get","her","but","you","have","to","suffer","through","painfulli","unfunni","trite","lifetim","movi","network","dialogu","murder","of","love","to","get","to","the","inevit","happi","endingbr","br","thi","be","truli","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see"],"filtered":["minut","rule","sometim","leav","lewai","movi","good","minut","probabl","go","ever","get","well","yet","experi","ani","movi","prove","contest","thi","theori","dan","real","life","definit","except","watch","thi","turkei","think","wow","thi","funni","touch","sad","like","ani","charact","allbr","br","stori","advic","columnistwidow","rais","three","young","daughter","fall","love","hi","brother","girlfriend","suppos","taglin","advic","columnist","us","advic","know","dan","charact","wai","strike","someon","qualifi","give","advic","guess","ironi","know","go","see","hi","parent","brother","sister","kid","sort","anual","famili","retreat","seem","veri","sweet","potenti","fodder","good","comedi","stori","linesnon","ever","emerg","central","stori","basic","love","thi","woman","ca","anyon","puls","realis","eventu","get","suffer","painfulli","unfunni","trite","lifetim","movi","network","dialogu","murder","love","get","inevit","happi","endingbr","br","thi","truli","wrong","movi","ever","see"],"filtered2":["minut","rule","sometim","leav","lewai","good","minut","probabl","go","ever","get","well","yet","experi","ani","prove","contest","theori","dan","real","life","definit","except","watch","turkei","think","wow","funni","touch","sad","like","ani","charact","allbr","stori","advic","columnistwidow","rais","three","young","daughter","fall","love","brother","girlfriend","suppos","taglin","advic","columnist","us","advic","know","dan","charact","wai","strike","someon","qualifi","give","advic","guess","ironi","know","go","see","parent","brother","sister","kid","sort","anual","famili","retreat","seem","veri","sweet","potenti","fodder","good","comedi","stori","linesnon","ever","emerg","central","stori","basic","love","woman","ca","anyon","puls","realis","eventu","get","suffer","painfulli","unfunni","trite","lifetim","network","dialogu","murder","love","get","inevit","happi","endingbr","truli","wrong","ever","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,10,12,15,17,20,25,26,27,30,33,35,44,54,56,59,62,70,74,75,80,81,114,127,135,139,148,149,158,169,182,194,224,232,243,248,269,273,286,333,342,381,392,426,455,500,540,547,585,605,633,670,716,730,745,948,1003,1044,1056,1241,1263,1283,1289,1388,1425,1520,1521,1694,1745,1752,1791,1908,2010,2041,2252,2465,2660,4406,4509,5868,6402,6612],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,10,12,15,17,20,25,26,27,30,33,35,44,54,56,59,62,70,74,75,80,81,114,127,135,139,148,149,158,169,182,194,224,232,243,248,269,273,286,333,342,381,392,426,455,500,540,547,585,605,633,670,716,730,745,948,1003,1044,1056,1241,1263,1283,1289,1388,1425,1520,1521,1694,1745,1752,1791,1908,2010,2041,2252,2465,2660,4406,4509,5868,6402,6612],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,2.389902141215977,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,3.83116108203179,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,2.600540117735859,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.4631690128991

{"value":"This movie was so bad it was laughable. I couldn't resist watching it though. The plot is standard, the acting quite horrible (supporting cast such as the nutty neighbor and the lawyer friend were better actors). Kind of amusing if you have some time to waste and like seeing the conclusion to a dramatic plot.<br /><br />The headliner who plays \"Kathy\" was just fascinating because I couldn't decide if her deadpan, flat affect was the result of bad surgery or simply bad acting (I decided it was both). This leaves the script to comment on, which was pretty awful. Pat remarks, idiotic decisions, and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie. Maybe this is what was so riveting; I don't know. I just watched it to see how bad it could be. (Actually the dialog doesn't even qualify to be called \"cliche'\" - but it's almost completely inane.)<br /><br />All in all, very bad, cheaply made movie. The sets, the same scenes (a house, a building) were shown over and over with no artistry or actual tie-in to the action; more like props that were randomly dropped into the action in a bad play. A chase scene could have been shot by any juvenile in a warehouse or an old school: poorly shot, cheap props, minimal action.... and I still wanted to see the ending.

{"value":"I don't know what the rest of you guys watch Steven Seagal movies for, but I watch them because, as silly as they are, they're at least always good for a laugh. Why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing, when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of?<br /><br />Attack Force is by no means a great movie, but I felt it was as worthy a Steven Seagal vehicle as many of his other movies; in fact I didn't think it was one of his worst by a long-shot. It had, most of the time, a half-way coherent plot line, and it was, most of the time, fundamentally exciting. The ending really sucked, but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements. In the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised, but I actually thought that the acting, characterization (if I may use such a big word) and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true Steven Seagal fan would expect. Seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone-faced, no-nonsense man's man that we've come to expect, and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well, without ever up-staging him.

{"value":"This really is one of the worst movies ever made. I consider myself a HUGE zombie film fan and usually tolerate bad acting, lame \"special effects\" a dumb story and whatever you may encounter in second rate movies, AS LONG as the film has a good atmosphere/story/suspension or whatever to offer. This one has basically no positive aspect to it and is third or fourth rate, maybe worse. Some friends of mine and myself made a small movie during a week´s holiday and definitely did a better job (no zombie film though).<br /><br />This flick is not even funny, not speaking of anything else. Really bad and redundant special effects, zombies that look like normal people (except for a white additional skin pulled over their faces), WAY TO MUCH fake blood (I like realism a lot, the combination of realism and Zombie films being debatable, but the presented gore is just plain silly). The camera stays quite long with feedings scenes, it gets boring and you cannot help but wonder, why the zombies use WEAPONS (!) to kill their prey. I will not go into the details of the dubbing (others have done so).

{"value":"In theory, 'Director's Commentary' should have worked. The talented Rob Bryden plays Peter DeLane, a former television director recounting his experiences behind the camera. Amongst the programmes he is alleged to have worked on are 'Bonanza', 'Flambards', 'The Duchess Of Duke Street', and 'The Bounder'. His commentaries are not the least bit informative, due to his habit of wandering off the point.<br /><br />But in practice, it failed dismally. It is a one-joke show, and the joke is not particularly funny. The scripts are completely lacking in wit, and Bryden fails to convince as an old man. Whenever stuck for anything amusing to say, which is like every five seconds, he issues a hissing laugh. Rather than being amused by DeLane, you want to shoot him. If senile old men strike you as hilarious, then this is for you.<br /><br />It didn't help that the shows mocked were, with the exceptions of 'Mr & Mrs' and 'Crossroads', rather good. For the joke to work, they needed to be really dreadful such as 'Charlie's Angels', 'O.T.T.', 'Telly Addicts', 'Neighbours', and 'New Faces'.<br /><br />The show tanked big time, so thankfully we are spared the horror of future editions.

{"value":"The \"Confidential\" part was meant to piggy-back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name, while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline Congressional investigations of the day. However, despite the A-grade B-movie cast and some good script ideas, the movie plods along for some 73 minutes. It's a cheap-jack production all the way. What's needed to off-set the poor production values is some imagination, especially from uninspired director Sidney Salkow. A few daylight location shots, for example, would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets. A stylish helmsman like Anthony Mann might have done something with the thick-ear material, but Salkow treats it as just another pay-day exercise. Too bad that Brian Keith's typical low-key style doesn't work here, coming across as merely wooden and lethargic, at the same time cult figure Elisha Cook Jr. goes over the top as a wild-eyed drunk. Clearly, Salkow is no actor's director. But, you've got to hand it to that saucy little number Beverly Garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication. Too bad, she wasn't in charge. My advice-- skip it, unless you're into ridiculous bar-girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical strait-jacketed 50's

{"value":"I had to write a review of this film after reading another comment saying that this is Sidney Poitier's best movie. Poitier had just returned from over a decade's break in film acting and he is clearly creaky here. 11 of his films are mentioned in Wikipedia and they don't include this. 5 of his films are on the AFI's list of top 100 inspiring movies, again, not including this. Berenger and Poitier, rube and city slicker set out to hunt down a dangerous psychopath before he crosses the border to Canada. Some of the attempts at comedy in this film clearly fail and Berenger and Poitier's bonding was cringeworthy and awkward (not helped by a completely bland script). Kirstie Alley (as the hostage) was underused, and almost entirely ignored when she was on screen. Some attempt at suspense is made, for example when you're meant to try and guess which of 5 men on a fishing trip is the murderer (all of them are type-cast villains). I understand that this is the entire appeal to most fans out there. I guessed who it was and I wasn't really trying hard.<br /><br />If you're a Berenger fan, watch the Sniper (1993), you even get to see Billy Zane strutting his stuff. It's much better.

{"value":"I find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the Exorcist. Where the Exorcist was subtle and creepy, Stigmata was blunt, clumsy, and way too formulaic.<br /><br />This is one of the most visually beautiful films I've seen in a while, but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exposition that makes it unbearable. <br /><br />My interest in this movie was peaked when it was compared to The Exorcist, and my visit to the official web site increased that interest. The web site had many tales of \"actual\" stigmata throughout history. However, scene by scene, the movie is so obsessed by its quest for \"genuineness\" that it becomes comical at first, then outright hard to watch toward the end. I began getting suspicious when the priest charged with investigating potential miracles walks into the beauty parlor where our would-be heroine cuts hair and, evidently, flirts with priests.<br /><br />The plot: A woman without faith in God begins receiving the wounds of Christ (the Stigmata) and is baffled and upset about the ordeal. A priest is sent straight from the Vatican to investigate the case.

{"value":"Detective Tony Rome (Frank Sinatra) returns to the screen after his self titled debut, this time it's a film that's played for ermlaughs. While on a diving trip, Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea, her feet as you might expect, encased in cement. Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky. Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types, who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect, he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone. The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective, oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch, but he fails miserably, in this ham fisted vanity project. The frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding, every woman in the film is a dither head, who likes bending over is front of the camera, Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles. There's even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief, this was a film made by \"real men\" for \"real men\" to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality, it's a shameful

{"value":"TYSON <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.33:1<br /><br />Sound format: Stereo<br /><br />Reverent - though scrupulously fair - account of the life and times of champion boxer Mike Tyson. Given his conviction on a rape charge, the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain, but paints a warts-and-all portrait of his rise to fame, the pressures of success, and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad. Constrained by time limits, the script gallops through a succession of relevant details, alighting briefly on significant events, culminating with Tyson's (temporary) downfall in 1995. Novices will be enlightened by the chronology, while boxing fans will be entertained by director Uli Edel's straight-arrow approach to the material. He portrays Tyson's life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success. In fact, the script reserves most of its venom for Tyson's ex-wife Robin Givens, characterising her as an ungrateful gold-digger who took advantage of his naivety. Production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb: Michael Jai White does a fair imitation of the title character; George C. Scott plays Tyson's mentor Cus D'Amato through acres of gritted teeth; and Paul Winfield was surely born to play Don

{"value":"A film without conscience. Drifter agrees to kill a man for a mobster for money. Then they double cross him. Meanwhile he falls in love with the dead man's wife, and, without her knowing he's the killer, moves in with her. Then he \"accidentally\" kills her when she finds out. Then, in a WALKING TALL kind of heroism, he gets revenge on the mobsters who double crossed him. The first problem is that, by agreeing to take on the murder by hire assignment, the drifter loses all sense of sympathy, worthiness, and heroism. We can't accept any goodness in him and as a result the rest of the has no moral center. We just can't care about that kind of guy. And the wife (nicely played by the fetching Kari Wuhrer - the sheriff in EIGHT LEGGED FREAKS), a high class lady who runs a mission for homeless people, similarly loses a degree of sympathy by jumping right into bed with the homeless drifter (despite her evidently weakened state after the death of her husband). And, when she finds out he's the guy  what does she do? She locks him inside her house (as if ALL houses had locks you can't open from INSIDE) with her and proceeds to berate him. Stoo-pid.

{"value":"Adapting plays into cinema is often a bad idea because they're two different mediums . Do you think it's a great idea to make ZULU into a stage play ? Imagine it where two valiant redcoats sit in a tent gasping \" Blimey there's thousands of them out there \" Great movie and a bad stage play <br /><br />In order for a stage play to make great cinema there's two essentials needed <br /><br />1) A fine cast that creates on screen chemistry <br /><br />2 ) Great dialogue <br /><br />On paper Cher and Chazz Palminterri would be a good casting choice but not in these roles . The story revolves around a hit-man played by Palminterri breaking into a house to kill a wife played by Cher with most of the action taking place inside the house . I was unable to take these two characters seriously though perhaps it was the fault of the script which can't decide whether it was trying to be serious or funny . Since the story is very static it's of the utmost importance that the dialogue shines and once again because of the bizarre tone of the screenplay it embarrasses more than anything else with much of

{"value":"I don't think any player in Hollywood history lasted as long as David Niven did given most of the weak films he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm. He could act, got an Oscar for it, but most of the material he did was as light as one ply of two ply tissue paper.<br /><br />Happy Go Lovely is a case in point. It's a musical and for the most part you'll remember Vera-Ellen's dancing. You'll remember that they are in Scot's costume as the film is set in Edinburgh during their festival. But if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memory.<br /><br />The plot is light. Vera-Ellen is the American lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in Edinburgh. She starts in the chorus and runs late one day. She gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king. Everybody now assumes she's the main squeeze of the millionaire. Doors open up as they've never opened before.<br /><br />The millionaire is David Niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake. Cesar Romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical.<br /><br />In the end though Happy Go Lovely is light and harmless fluff which David Niven did so much of and got so
