{"value":"This had high intellectual pretensions.The main lead intends to give a \"deep\" \"meaningful\" rendering(with voice over for his frames of mind naturally) and he was certainly influenced by the fifties/sixties \"method \" -which,when the script and the direction were worthwhile did give stunning results (see Clift,Newman,Winters).But here the story is abysmal.Besides it moves too slow,you could edit at least 20 minutes -including pointless flashbacks-and the plot line would not be changed .At times ,it's very doubtful that Bruce Dern believes in his \"Uncle \"character and his portraying often verges on parody.An interesting side is only skimmed over:the relationship young boy/hero -if we admit that the hero is himself some kind of child- When he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to him,some welcome tenderness emerges.But it's botched and only the final scene returns to it.<br /><br />Word to the wise:Take Foley's \"at close range\" instead:it has two great actors (Christopher Walken and Sean Penn together!),it's also an offbeat movie ,but it's gripping,suspenseful.Here my hitchcockometer points sullenly towards zero throughout.","finished_norm":["thi","have","high","intellectu","pretensionsth","main","lead","intend","to","give","a","deep","meaning","renderingwith","voic","over","for","hi","frame","of","mind","natur","and","he","be","certainli","influenc","by","the","fiftiessixti","method","whichwhen","the","script","and","the","direct","be","worthwhil","do","give","stun","result","see","cliftnewmanwintersbut","here","the","stori","be","abysmalbesid","it","move","too","slowyou","can","edit","at","littl","minut","includ","pointless","flashbacksand","the","plot","line","would","not","be","chang","at","time","it","veri","doubt","that","bruce","dern","believ","in","hi","uncl","charact","and","hi","portrai","often","verg","on","parodyan","interest","side","be","onli","skim","overth","relationship","young","boyhero","if","we","admit","that","the","hero","be","himself","some","kind","of","child","when","he","sai","to","the","young","kid","that","he","would","let","nobodi","do","harm","to","himsom","welcom","tender","emergesbut","it","botch","and","onli","the","final","scene","return","to","itbr","br","word","to","the","wisetak","folei","at","close","rang","insteadit","have","two","great","actor","christoph","walken","and","sean","penn","togetherit","conjur","a","offbeat","movi","but","it","grippingsuspensefulher","my","hitchcockomet","point","sullenli","toward","zero","throughout"],"filtered":["thi","high","intellectu","pretensionsth","main","lead","intend","give","deep","meaning","renderingwith","voic","hi","frame","mind","natur","certainli","influenc","fiftiessixti","method","whichwhen","script","direct","worthwhil","give","stun","result","see","cliftnewmanwintersbut","stori","abysmalbesid","move","slowyou","edit","littl","minut","includ","pointless","flashbacksand","plot","line","chang","time","veri","doubt","bruce","dern","believ","hi","uncl","charact","hi","portrai","often","verg","parodyan","interest","side","onli","skim","overth","relationship","young","boyhero","admit","hero","kind","child","sai","young","kid","let","nobodi","harm","himsom","welcom","tender","emergesbut","botch","onli","final","scene","return","itbr","br","word","wisetak","folei","close","rang","insteadit","two","great","actor","christoph","walken","sean","penn","togetherit","conjur","offbeat","movi","grippingsuspensefulher","hitchcockomet","point","sullenli","toward","zero","throughout"],"filtered2":["high","intellectu","pretensionsth","main","lead","intend","give","deep","meaning","renderingwith","voic","frame","mind","natur","certainli","influenc","fiftiessixti","method","whichwhen","script","direct","worthwhil","give","stun","result","see","cliftnewmanwintersbut","stori","abysmalbesid","move","slowyou","edit","littl","minut","includ","pointless","flashbacksand","plot","line","chang","time","veri","doubt","bruce","dern","believ","uncl","charact","portrai","often","verg","parodyan","interest","side","onli","skim","overth","relationship","young","boyhero","admit","hero","kind","child","young","kid","let","nobodi","harm","himsom","welcom","tender","emergesbut","botch","onli","final","scene","return","itbr","word","wisetak","folei","close","rang","insteadit","two","great","actor","christoph","walken","sean","penn","togetherit","conjur","offbeat","grippingsuspensefulher","hitchcockomet","point","sullenli","toward","zero","throughout"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,10,11,14,15,17,19,30,32,39,41,47,51,59,60,66,77,91,102,107,114,122,124,135,156,157,179,180,211,238,258,275,278,295,301,348,375,389,400,425,428,431,438,447,456,469,488,534,563,567,577,691,834,866,926,964,1162,1335,1400,1457,1553,1555,1670,1702,1777,2012,2016,2322,2356,2524,2809,3679,4780,4881,5344,5881,7026,7916,8592],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,10,11,14,15,17,19,30,32,39,41,47,51,59,60,66,77,91,102,107,114,122,124,135,156,157,179,180,211,238,258,275,278,295,301,348,375,389,400,425,428,431,438,447,456,469,488,534,563,567,577,691,834,866,926,964,1162,1335,1400,1457,1553,1555,1670,1702,1777,2012,2016,2322,2356,2524,2809,3679,4780,4881,5344,5881,7026,7916,8592],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.982619630677639,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,2.6728839783437044,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,1.929723173391612,1.9463902258768238,2.0105926690411424,2.087553710177271,2.1439533986393955,2.4433074195966826,2.2489347673732487,2.2323930368088845,4.732488142874176,2.3451551414151686,2.3360150694757706,2.507968722980095,2.7097314792693545,2.5687161421197025,2.5973046

{"value":"First of all, let me say that this is not the movie for people looking to watch something spirited and joyous for the holidays. This movie is cold, brutal, and just downright depressing. Mary Steenburgen plays a grinchy mom who is down on Christmas because her husband has lost his job, they are losing their house, can't buy Christmas presents for the kids, etc. You get the idea, happy stuff for the holidays. So along comes Harry Dean Stanton as Gideon the Christmas angel, who in his dark hat and long overcoat comes off more like a pedophile who hangs around children all day observing them. What better way to instill the spirit of Christmas in Mary Steenburgen than to kill off her family and then offer to bring them back if she believes in Christmas again. Santa Claus is a blackmailer and his Christmas workshop looks more like a haven for refugee Nazis on the lam. The movie lays everything on so thick that you don't care about the happy ending when it comes because the rest of the movie is so bitter and unbelievable. I'm sure this film wanted to be something Capra-like, but it left out the joy and sentiment on what a holiday film should be.","finished_norm":["of","all","let","me","sai","that","thi","be","not","the","movi","for","peopl","look","to","watch","someth","spirit","and","joyou","for","the","holidai","thi","movi","be","cold","brutal","and","just","downright","depress","mari","steenburgen","plai","a","grinchi","mom","who","be","down","on","christma","becaus","her","husband","have","lose","hi","job","thei","be","lose","their","hous","ca","not","bui","christma","present","for","the","kid","etc","you","get","the","idea","happi","stuff","for","the","holidai","so","along","come","harri","dean","stanton","a","gideon","the","christma","angel","who","in","hi","dark","hat","and","long","overcoat","come","off","much","like","a","pedophil","who","hang","around","child","all","dai","observ","them","what","well","wai","to","instil","the","spirit","of","christma","in","mari","steenburgen","than","to","kill","off","her","famili","and","then","offer","to","bring","them","back","if","she","believ","in","christma","again","santa","clau","be","a","blackmail","and","hi","christma","workshop","look","much","like","a","haven","for","refuge","nazi","on","the","lam","the","movi","lai","everyth","on","so","thick","that","you","do","not","care","about","the","happi","end","when","it","come","becaus","the","rest","of","the","movi","be","so","bitter","and","unbeliev","i","be","sure","thi","film","want","to","be","someth","capralik","but","it","leav","out","the","joi","and","sentim","on","what","a","holidai","film","should","be"],"filtered":["let","sai","thi","movi","peopl","look","watch","someth","spirit","joyou","holidai","thi","movi","cold","brutal","downright","depress","mari","steenburgen","plai","grinchi","mom","christma","becaus","husband","lose","hi","job","thei","lose","hous","ca","bui","christma","present","kid","etc","get","idea","happi","stuff","holidai","along","come","harri","dean","stanton","gideon","christma","angel","hi","dark","hat","long","overcoat","come","much","like","pedophil","hang","around","child","dai","observ","well","wai","instil","spirit","christma","mari","steenburgen","kill","famili","offer","bring","back","believ","christma","santa","clau","blackmail","hi","christma","workshop","look","much","like","haven","refuge","nazi","lam","movi","lai","everyth","thick","care","happi","end","come","becaus","rest","movi","bitter","unbeliev","sure","thi","film","want","someth","capralik","leav","joi","sentim","holidai","film"],"filtered2":["let","peopl","look","watch","someth","spirit","joyou","holidai","cold","brutal","downright","depress","mari","steenburgen","plai","grinchi","mom","christma","becaus","husband","lose","job","lose","hous","ca","bui","christma","present","kid","etc","get","idea","happi","stuff","holidai","along","come","harri","dean","stanton","gideon","christma","angel","dark","hat","long","overcoat","come","like","pedophil","hang","around","child","dai","observ","well","wai","instil","spirit","christma","mari","steenburgen","kill","famili","offer","bring","back","believ","christma","santa","clau","blackmail","christma","workshop","look","like","haven","refuge","nazi","lam","lai","everyth","thick","care","happi","end","come","becaus","rest","bitter","unbeliev","sure","want","someth","capralik","leav","joi","sentim","holidai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,16,20,22,23,24,33,34,37,40,53,63,74,76,81,91,98,99,114,119,123,124,132,180,182,193,205,213,221,226,250,289,324,347,361,368,411,429,507,536,571,605,748,848,894,923,1010,1036,1075,1107,1121,1134,1191,1556,1706,1731,1847,1855,1934,2031,2184,2686,2886,3060,3073,3596,6027,6705],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,16,20,22,23,24,33,34,37,40,53,63,74,76,81,91,98,99,114,119,123,124,132,180,182,193,205,213,221,226,250,289,324,347,361,368,411,429,507,536,571,605,748,848,894,923,1010,1036,1075,1107,1121,1134,1191,1556,1706,1731,1847,1855,1934,2031,2184,2686,2886,3060,3073,3596,6027,6705],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,2.393227744058217,1.165345040023057,2.5958480334723544,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.4018535447685214,4.194855026837689,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,3.400636547121535,1.8729627573220065,1.9486336368009016,2.1337665533324026,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.0881990796736947,2.056430207256609,2.4433074195966826,2.1653408989309972,2.2619070973220485,2.2323930368088845,2.253494045787767,2.7097314792693545,2.7365296724240786,2.517840471459249,2.571852579609833,2.8432628718938773,5.284684914728755,2.5940874818617203,2.6812935439488212,2.8282659991423613,2.8753661172782943,3.0151989841543516,3.0399731661399314,3.1346146732346205,3.229006157521873,3.2872346624216657,3.365138331846453,3.62542143011

{"value":"There's a major difference between releasing an original, intense, edge-of-your-seat, scary, gore-fest, and doing like filmmaker Eli Roth and his team have done with \"Cabin Fever\" and simply acted like it. The film follows five college graduates into a cabin in the woods that begins to prove fatal as one after the other succumbs to this mysterious, fast-acting, flesh-eating disease. It's not long before the friends turn on one another, and can barely stand the sight of one another, much less want to be in the same vicinity as them. As gross as it all sounds, there's a certain spark behind the basic premise of this film that could have worked, in the hands of a less cocky filmmaker. Unfortunately what we end up with is poorly drawn characters whose sole purpose seems to be to look beautiful at the beginning to make the inevitable decomposition more contrasting, a hackneyed script so profanity-laden as to leave the viewer tuning out the dialogue, and several incomprehensible subplots that motivate little more than (in one instance) an on-screen appearance by director Roth. This is sloppy film-making in several ways!

{"value":"First off, I would like to point out that while I am not an expert, the way the trial was handled will insult your intelligence. Firstly, the prosecution never proved that 'facilitated learning' actually works. Irresponsible for both the prosecution(because they can get an appeal) and the defense for not acting on this. As another commenter said, facilitated learning was proved untrue. Secondly, they used Terry as the translator who has personal interest, and even will testify, in the trial which is just stupid. If the court had allowed him to testify that way, they would have brought in someone neutral otherwise they would be just asking for an appeal. Thirdly, this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecution(birthmarks, details of the event, etc.) and even when asked by the defense specific questions like when it started, he could not answer. If that isn't reasonable doubt I don't know what is and a competent lawyer would have gotten an acquittal.<br /><br />Bottom line, it starts off well with the pressures of being the parent of a child

{"value":"Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past.If such a film is shown to people again,it would surely click provided if it has something new,fresh and captivating for today's challenging audiences. This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film's principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend.She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting.Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format.Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser.If someone were to state a positive

{"value":"Here we have a movie which fails in pretty much every way it is possible for a movie to fail. Terrible script, lousy acting, amateurish directing, laughable special effects...it's just an utterly awful movie. Not to mention the fact that when you get to the end you'll realize the whole thing doesn't make a lick of sense. After spending the whole movie wondering what in the world is going on here when things are finally explained you realize the story has been built on a foundation which is ludicrously impossible. In one of those hideous \"villain explains the whole movie\" sequences we are told that our villain has done something which quite simply can't be done and which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. Oh, and after that we see that there also appears to be some kind of jell-o monster involved. I'm sure Drew Barrymore would very much like to pretend this movie never happened. If for some ungodly reason you are ever tempted to sit down and watch this movie may I suggest instead taking that time to bang your head against a wall for 104 minutes.

{"value":"I saw this movie twice through a pentecostal church my family attended in Nanaimo BC in the 1970's. I was of the tender age of 6, my brother 4, then again when I was 8 my brother 6. This movie terrified my brother and I and shaped how we viewed the world with distrust. It wasn't just the movie, but it was also the philosophy that engulfs so many \"christians\" about the \"mark of the beast\"and the rapture. This movie, the church, and a volatile neglectful upbringing, lead to severe paranoia towards the future. For years, I lived under the delusional affects of the church and fear of being forgotten by Christ. I am now 40 years old. Went through years of counseling. I once explained to a psychiatrist this movie and the belief system of the church and family. I was pegged with a delusional disorder. I actually began to believe this, it was my brother who reminded me, that this cultic philosophy actually happened. I no longer fear the future, I have come to terms with the fear injected into it's members by the church.

{"value":"I still can't believe this movie. They got so much unbelievable things in it, that it's hard to believe anyone wanted to make it.<br /><br />The story is a joke, but in the sense of being funny, but more like no story at all. How can you mix a slapstick comedy with a train robbery, a prison movie, town conspiracies, sex-jokes and a FBI-agent? You can't.<br /><br />Beside the terrifying directing the most noticeable thing are the actors. I watched this film and thought: 'Is this really Marlon Brando? No, it can't be. (5 minutes later) Is this Charlie Sheen? Wow, maybe Brando is true. (5 minutes later) This can't be Donald Sutherland. (5 minutes later) No, not Mira Sorvino. This movie is too bad for all of them. (At the end). No, no, no, this can't absolutely not be Martin Sheen!!! Not for 10 seconds of such a movie.' Then it was over and I down with my nerves. SO many good, oscar-winning, usually convincing actors in such a stupid, dumb, awful movie. I rarely wanted to know so much how they came to act in this one.

{"value":"Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood worst overrated movies ever. Directed by Anil Sharma, who prefers making period related movie gives a rubbish movie. The songs were boring and ain't the kind of song you want to listen to in your car, full volume. Sunny Deol is famous for making daft movies, where he beats up a 100 bad guys on his own. He even kicks a metal jail door (Indian) and kicks a moving car far away (Teesri Aankh). I can give another 50 examples of disgraceful action by Sunny Deol. But I'm sure most people know this already. Sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role. A guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece, by using violence. Amisha Patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone. But even she couldn't save the film from being a disaster. Instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does, in this movie she doesn't. Maybe cos she was playing a Muslim, but she doesn't act like one in the movie. Overall, this is a poor show all the way, I'm sure it will appeal to some people, who love seeing the Bollywood actor beat up 100 guys.

{"value":"There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer: actress Nichole Hiltz. She is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge. Directed by Simon Gornick, the film stars Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin' spouse. Oh, but not by conventional means. She plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her weapon of choice. She wants Nichole (as Tuesday) to get close to her ex (the handsome but dull Stephan Jenkins, who should stick to music) to embarrass him and ruin his life. David DeLuise is good in his few brief moments, and former \"Crime Story\" star Anthony Dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl. Hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful, then evil and devious. She also handles vulnerable and \"maybe a bit psychotic\" well. She's also quite hot (though there's no naughty bits show) so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at. But the performance is kind of wasted in this movie, which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend.","finished_norm":["there","be","onli","on","reason","to","watch","thi","movi","if","you","be","not","relat","to","on","of","the","star","or","a","produc","actress","nichol","hiltz","she","be","the","show","in","thi","slow","move","and","wildli","unlik","stori","of","reveng","direct","by","simon","gornick","the","film","star","joyc","hyser","a","a","betrai","wife","who","decid","to","seek","reveng","on","her","cheatin","spous","oh","but","not","by","convent","mean","she","plan","a","total","guerrilla","war","and","recruit","bad","girl","nichol","hiltz","a","her","weapon","of","choic","she","want","nichol","a","tuesdai","to","get","close","to","her","ex","the","handsom","but","dull","stephan","jenkin","who","should","stick","to","music","to","embarrass","him","and","ruin","hi","life","david","deluis","be","good","in","hi","few","brief","moment","and","former","crime","stori","star","anthoni","dennison","be","give","virtual","noth","to","do","but","scowl","hiltz","on","the","other","hand","come","off","at","variou","time","a","sexi","and","play","then","evil","and","deviou","she","conjur","handl","vulner","and","mayb","a","bite","psychot","good","she","conjur","quit","hot","though","there","no","naughti","bit","show","so","you","can","understand","how","she","mai","be","abl","to","get","to","ani","gui","she","be","aim","at","but","the","perform","be","kind","of","wast","in","thi","movi","which","be","just","not","edgi","or","interest","enough","to","recommend"],"filtered":["onli","reason","watch","thi","movi","relat","star","produc","actress","nichol","hiltz","show","thi","slow","move","wildli","unlik","stori","reveng","direct","simon","gornick","film","star","joyc","hyser","betrai","wife","decid","seek","reveng","cheatin","spous","oh","convent","mean","plan","total","guerrilla","war","recruit","bad","girl","nichol","hiltz","weapon","choic","want","nichol","tuesdai","get","close","ex","handsom","dull","stephan","jenkin","stick","music","embarrass","ruin","hi","life","david","deluis","good","hi","brief","moment","former","crime","stori","star","anthoni","dennison","give","virtual","noth","scowl","hiltz","hand","come","variou","time","sexi","play","evil","deviou","conjur","handl","vulner","mayb","bite","psychot","good","conjur","quit","hot","though","naughti","bit","show","understand","mai","abl","get","ani","gui","aim","perform","kind","wast","thi","movi","edgi","interest","enough","recommend"],"filtered2":["onli","reason","watch","relat","star","produc","actress","nichol","hiltz","show","slow","move","wildli","unlik","stori","reveng","direct","simon","gornick","star","joyc","hyser","betrai","wife","decid","seek","reveng","cheatin","spous","oh","convent","mean","plan","total","guerrilla","war","recruit","bad","girl","nichol","hiltz","weapon","choic","want","nichol","tuesdai","get","close","ex","handsom","dull","stephan","jenkin","stick","music","embarrass","ruin","life","david","deluis","good","brief","moment","former","crime","stori","star","anthoni","dennison","give","virtual","noth","scowl","hiltz","hand","come","variou","time","sexi","play","evil","deviou","conjur","handl","vulner","mayb","bite","psychot","good","conjur","quit","hot","though","naughti","bit","show","understand","mai","abl","get","ani","gui","aim","perform","kind","wast","edgi","interest","enough","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,8,9,11,17,27,28,30,34,37,39,46,49,55,60,75,84,86,88,89,93,95,100,102,105,118,120,122,154,163,184,188,212,234,235,249,261,263,275,295,298,314,321,354,367,390,416,454,557,581,615,666,675,710,753,808,871,903,942,945,1040,1087,1186,1205,1238,1278,1316,1381,1710,1873,2065,2521,2616,3042,3064,3231,3407,3633,4196,5152,5617,6341,6672,6701,7249,7908,8037,8559,8618],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,8,9,11,17,27,28,30,34,37,39,46,49,55,60,75,84,86,88,89,93,95,100,102,105,118,120,122,154,163,184,188,212,234,235,249,261,263,275,295,298,314,321,354,367,390,416,454,557,581,615,666,675,710,753,808,871,903,942,945,1040,1087,1186,1205,1238,1278,1316,1381,1710,1873,2065,2521,2616,3042,3064,3231,3407,3633,4196,5152,5617,6341,6672,6701,7249,7908,8037,8559,8618],"values":[1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,2.5541073880211935,1.3002700588679295,3.0904588387038183,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,3.1077880109725475,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,1.9536997889255368,1.838176641236591,1.9742250248702675,2.2212694515902225,2.031112399272319,2.0317223413467334,1.9940046109572438,2.035389827120098,2.03233265567

{"value":"I never thought I see a movie worse than \"Lisa Picard Is Famous\", but this came pretty close. As repeated often throughout the comments, it was predictable; five minutes into the movie you know it will be a stranded at the alter outcome. This movie painfully references/rips off everything from \"Something about Mary\" to \"Revenge of the Pink Panther\". Writer Greg Glienna (Meet the Parents) needs some new material.<br /><br />The only twist is the deranged boyfriend/police officer pursued by internal affairs, but even that opportunity is wasted. Lots of setting shots of the Seattle Space Needle necessary to disguise the obvious Canadian shooting locale. Some of the worst driving in the car scenes with almost no effort to disguise the fact that the car is being pulled through town on a trailer. Geez, at least turn the wheel or put the brakes on once in a while. Selma Blair is inert and the short haircut a crime. $3M to Jason Lee, for what? Guess it beats skateboarding!<br /><br />So here's who should see this movie: Bee Gees fans who want to hear two actors sing 'Islands in the Stream' badly; People who can't get enough of Julia Stiles.

{"value":"It was almost unfathomable to me that this film would be a bust but I was indeed disappointed. Having been a connoisseur of Pekinpah cinema for years, I found this DVD, drastically reduced, for sale and thought it was worth a shot. The opening few credits, iconic to Pekinpah fans, has the inter-cutting between man and animal, but here we have non-diegetic ambient noise of children playing in a schoolyard while a bomb is being planted. Fantastic suspense. Then, when the perps, Caan and Duval, travel to their next mission, Duval drops the bomb on Cann that his date last night had an STD, found only by snooping through her purse while Cann was being intimate with her. The ensuing laughter is fantastic, and is clearly paid homage to in Brian Depalma's Dressed to Kill, at the short-lived expense of Angle Dickenson. The problem with The Killer Elite is that after the opening credits, the film falls flat. Even Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia has stronger production value, a bold call for anyone who knows what I'm talking about.

{"value":"This film is really bad. It maybe harsh, but it is. It really is. Poor script, every vampire cliché in the book is used, and no sympathy is given at all to the origins of the main character ... i.e. ole Dracula. There have been some truly brilliant Dracula/vampire movies in the past, but this doesn't even make it into the \"dire\" slot.<br /><br />Take a selection of people who seem to have dropped out of a teen-slasher move, add a dribble of Dracula Lore and mix in a heady tonic of religious/surreal day-dreaming ... and you get a confusing mess of a film - Dracula 2000.<br /><br />I really cannot find any good things to say about this movie, as if it wasn't bad enough that it was made in the first place, they seem to have made Johnny Lee Miller effect an English accent ... Whats the problem with that I hear you cry ... Well, he is English, but he sounds like an American trying to do an English accent.<br /><br />All in all you may as well say your money (if you were thinking of buying it), or rent it out, watch it, and discover for yourself why it's about as scary as the Tellytubbies.<br /><br />P.S.

{"value":"I saw this at the premiere in Melbourne<br /><br />It is shallow, two-dimensional, unaffecting and, hard to believe given the subject matter, boring. The actors are passable, but they didn't have much to work with given the very plodding and unimpressive script. For those who might have worried that Ned Kelly would be over-intellectualised, you can take comfort in the fact that this telling of the story is utterly without any literary depth at all, told entirely on the surface and full of central casting standards. However, it doesn't work as a popcorn film either. Its pacing is too off-kilter and its craft is too lacking to satisfy even on the level of a mundane actioner.<br /><br />I very much doubt Gregor Jordan could sit back and say to himself \"this is the best I could have done with the material\".<br /><br />Ned Kelly is a fascinating figure, and equally so is the national response to him. Possibly folk genius, possibly class warrior, possibly psychopath and probably all these things, he has dominated Australian true mythology for over 120 years.

{"value":"Former private eye-turned-security guard ditches his latest droning job and is immediately offered a chance to return to his previous profession. His assignment: to tail a mysterious French woman newly arrived in California...and apparently wanted by suit-and-tie racketeers. Unsuccessful attempt to update the film noir genre, without enough sting or wit (or involving plot dynamics) in the screenplay. Director and co-scenarist Paul Magwood (who later claimed the picture was edited without his involvement) doesn't give off the impression of having high regard for the '40s films his \"Chandler\" was borne from; his nostalgia is appropriately rumpled, but also bitter-tinged and somewhat indifferent. The handling is curiously, commendably low-keyed, and Warren Oates is well-cast as this '70s variant on the 'private dick' archetype, but the movie doesn't have any snap. Nice to see Leslie Caron and Gloria Grahame in the cast--though neither has much to do, and Caron's hot-and-cold running character is exasperating throughout. Vivid cinematography by Alan Stensvold, nice location shooting, but it fails to come to any kind of a boil. *1/2 from

{"value":"There have been some low moments in my life, when I have been bewildered and depressed. Sitting through Rancid Aluminium was one of these.<br /><br />The warning signs were there. No premiere (even the stars didn't want to attend) and no reviews in magazines. The only reason I sat through the film was in the hope that I might catch up on some sleep.<br /><br />Nothing in the film was explained. The narration was idiotic. I cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot, then to my growing despair, it was revealed that he hadn't really been shot dampening my joy. I sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity. <br /><br />There were some positive aspects, mainly unintentional moments of humour.

{"value":"With a tendency to repeat himself, Wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with 'Paris Texas'.<br /><br />'Land of plenty' is no exception. Taking into the fact that I anticipated an average-mediocre film even before I went in, Wenders' ambitions seem to always get the better of him. It's taken for grated now his films are heavy-handed and bombastic.<br /><br />I weren't sure if I was watching a comedy that mocks Middle America or some thriller. The outcome of Diehl's character is wholly predicable. Wender's insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying. He was covering up the holes in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenes.<br /><br />I am certain that many people will find this film important and resonant but in all honestly, this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of poor direction.<br /><br />Interesting that Wenders professed that while making 'Paris Texas', he had great help from Sam Sheppard with the script. Yes, that was Wenders' best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter.

{"value":"Featured in 1955's THE COBWEB is an all star cast ranging from silent screen veteran LILLIAN GISH to Actors Studio progeny SUSAN STRASBERG. Set at an exclusive psychiatric hospital, what is this movie about you wonder......high drama ? Doctor & patient relationships ? Shock therapy treatment ? No, this howler is about who exactly will get to pick the draperies for a psychiatric hospital ! You think I'm kidding ? You won't believe your eyes as you're watching this unbelievable storyline that was turned into a movie ! Progressive head shrink Dr. McIver (RICHARD WIDMARK) wants to have all of the hospital's patients involved in the design, selection and execution of the needed new draperies. McIver's wife played by marble mouthed GLORIA GRAHAM wants to get her 2 cents in on this monumental task too. So does long time staffer Miss Inch (LILLIAN GISH). Directed by VINCENT MINELLI, you kinda wonder if he really became this overly involved in minute detail because of his marriage to worry wart JUDY GARLAND. Talented actors like LAUREN BACALL, SUSAN STRASBERG, CHARLES BOYER, and JOHN KERR are wasted in this hokey story.

{"value":"\"Stella\", starring Bette Midler in the title role, is an unabashed tearjerker. Set in upstate New York, Stella Claire works nights as a bar maid, pouring and dancing in a workingman's saloon. One night, in comes a slumming medical intern, Stephen Dallas, who woos Stella, and in the course of their affair impregnates her. She spurns both his offers of marriage and abortion, sends him packing to a lucrative medical career, and raises her daughter herself in near-poverty. Flash-forward 16 years and the daughter has grown into a gorgeous, loving, young lady. Dr. Dallas is not out of the picture, still maintaining a tenuous, but caring relationship with his daughter and..I'm rambling, and worse yet, making the movie sound somewhat interesting. The acting and screenwriting are so over-the-top you'll let out a groan in almost every scene. The chief offender is Bette Midler, but close behind is John Goodman as her alcoholic buddy. Each scene seems more contrived than the preceding right up to the finale, which is truly a hoot. Taken as a dramatic piece, this film rates no more than grade D, but as camp, it scores an unintended B+.<br /><br

{"value":"what ends up killing this movie is its self-consciousness, among other things. here's a short list: 1. irreverent behavior. when the beatles came over and injected their brand of \"quirky, irreverent\" behavior/humor, it was greeted as fresh. that was over 4 decades ago. get over it.<br /><br />2. false sophistication. spewing out base, quasi-socio-political-isms is hard ground to make work comically. ask woody allen.<br /><br />3. the post-modern \"i'm hard on this phony world and yes, i recognize it in myself\" snake eating itself - used as illustration with another animal in the film itself! - is such a retread.<br /><br />4. smarmy, smug drollness.<br /><br />5. amateurish writing, acting, direction... ever seen student films? a victim of itself, about the only thing i can say positive is that it at least has a sense of itself, and sheesh, now i'm getting caught up in the self-reflexive thing that it posits as worthwhile, of value.<br /><br />but towards... what? ultimately, it just rings as hollow as any other pretentious piece - hey, ever see woody allen's take on bergman, ie: \"Interiors\"??? well, this just does it more

{"value":"At first glance this documentary/fiction/cartoon is quite entertaining and thought provoking. Of course, when something provokes thought, it can then be scrutinized. The reality is this movie combines metaphysics with innuendo and baseless conclusions. The link that \"What the Bleep...\" would have you see between science and spirituality is, in fact, not rooted in science at all. The Transcendental Meditation study mentioned in the film claims that meditation by a group can reduce crime in a given area, Washington D.C. in this case. In reality the HRA (Homicides, Rapes, and Assaults) crime rate was about 30% higher in 1993 than the average crime rate between 19881992. There was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study. In fact, each and every claim that links metaphysics to science can and has been debunked.<br /><br />My conclusion from this information is that this movie is either a poor attempt to indoctrinate people or a joke.

{"value":"This is probably one of the worst films i have ever seen. The events in it are completely random and make little or no sense. The fact that there is a sequel is so sickening i may come down with a case of cabin fever (I'M SO SORRY). I describe it as bug being smooshed to a newspaper because it seems to be different parts of things mixed together. e.g Kevin the pancake loving karate kid is just freakishly weird on its own, then there's the cop who is slightly weird and perverted, then the drug addict, then there's the fact that they attack some random guy who clearly needs help. then all of a sudden the main character is having sex with his friends girlfriend just because she says something stupid about a plane going down. then at the end some good old family racism followed by a rabbit operating on Kevin the karate kid. Its actually pretty despicable that they can use racism as a joke in this film. There is no reason for anyone to enjoy this film unless you love Eli Roth, even that did not make me like this film. Hate is a strong word but seeing as it is the only word i am permitted to use it will have to do.

{"value":"Can it ever be said that there are some movies that have no redeeming features whatsoever? Answer: Yes, and this is one of them. After helming the appalling 'House of the Dead' director Uwe Boll has now cast his less-than-talented eye towards yet another video game adaptation. Don't these guys get it? To anyone who can't understand, here it is in block capitals for you: VIDEO GAMES DO NOT MAKE FOR GOOD MOVIES! The acting here is, at best, sub-standard. The set design and special effects are poor. Unlike the video game (which did have its scary moments) the movie has no atmosphere of impending doom, no sense of danger or menace. Pacing and plotting is confused and the paper that the script is printed on would have been better used as toilet paper. The main culprit is the director. Uwe Boll uses the camera with the grace and skill of a monkey using a paintbrush. Hackneyed zooms, swoops and pans are spliced into the whole dreary affair at unpredictable moments leaving the audience disorientated and bored. Why this guy was ever let near a movie set in the first place must stand as one of modern cinemas greatest secrets.

{"value":"Saturday Night Live, National Lampoon, and SCTV alumnus are all together in a sometimes funny sketch film.<br /><br />However, it is very interesting to watch now, at the start of 2005. Twenty years after this movie is supposed to take place, look at how many of their gags have become absolutely true: There is a mock movie trailer, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, for something called \"The Pregnant Man\" which came true with Arnold Schwarzenegger's dumb movie \"Junior\" There is a commercial spoof, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, for something featuring Sammy Davis Jr. and Jackie Onasis called \"Celebrity Wrestling\" which has now come true with a popular show called \"Celebrity Boxing\" There is a mock movie trailer, that probably wasn't even clever at the time, that features John Candy in a movie about a severed head. Watch this trailer and look how similar it's shots and plot are to Frank Hellenlotter's Basket Case!! And finally there is an ad for a late late show documentary about \"a dead dream, the only two left ...\" The name of the documentary is ... THE LAST HIPPIES!

{"value":"As a great admirer of Marlene Dietrich, I had to (finally) watch this very, very dull picture. It is Miss Dietrich's first color film, and the world's most beautiful blond is a redhead! Bad start. The story is a tremendous bore, involving a subject which itself bores bores me stiff: religious guilt. (Who needs it???) Suffice it to say, perhaps, that of all Dietrich's films (and I have seen most, including \"Pittsburgh\") this is the only one where even her performance is barely worth watching. The color photography is OK (this is a very early Technicolor release), but to no purpose. Ridiculous casting: C. Aubrey Smith, Basil Rathbone (enough said?). The only thing of any interest at all is John Carradine's outlandish caricature of a performance as \"The Sand Diviner,\" who foretells all that will happen. The supposed \"happy ending\" is one of the most depressing ever conceived. Yet another example of David O. Selznick's highly inflated reputation (did he ever make a really good film? -- other than That One?) And, for one final annoyance, the soundtrack of the MGM DVD is a mess, with volume levels seemingly randomized.

{"value":"Where to start. The film started out pretty well, but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock. The horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in. It just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by.<br /><br />The actors gave an average performance in this movie however, i got a bit bored of Vinny Jones constant scowling in the film.<br /><br />As the film dragged on, and take my word for it, it dragged on, it just got more and more far fetched.<br /><br />*** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** SPOILER ALERT *** Just when i thought the film could not get any worse, towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up, just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all. It turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end. The ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was. Once the lead role disposes of Vinny Jones, he becomes the new killer.<br /><br />In closing, this film made Creep look like the best horror film ever made.

{"value":"I saw this movie, and at times, I was unnerved believing this movie 'saw me.' Munchie sullies the 'farce' for years to come. Re-watch Star Wars, Don't-watch Munchie.<br /><br />As a responsible parent (I'm speaking to those who are parents now), I (you) would not let my (your) child ever partake of this video festival of the pseudo-occult. To insinuate Munchie is satanic, to a co-viewer, is likely to illicit a chilled 'duh.' He is fiendish, alien, rodential, and wholly malevolent - like the Bogey man made flesh, invisible to adults, tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford (without the income made possible by years of self denial and prudent stewardship). He is a peddler of easy answers, and false ideals. He is everything the morally conscious viewer is not. He is the devil's own Ron Popeil.<br /><br />I pray (I mean this literally and figuratively, with an emphasis on the former) that this movie has not made the format jump to DVD. It is my hope that this type of 'yellow film making' died an un-mourned death in the cold nights of 1994.<br /><br />Munchie also loves pizza. I forgot to mention that.

{"value":"I read some gushing reviews here on IMDb and thought I would give this movie a look. Disappointed. On the plus side the male leads are good, and some interesting photography but as a whole this movie fails to convince. Seems to be full of its' own self indulgent importance in trying to say something meaningful but falls way short and all in all the picture is an unconvincing mess.<br /><br />It is one of those films classified as a film noir which can be defined as follows:<br /><br />\"A film noir is marked by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, menace and cynical characters\".<br /><br />Well that is the story here: 3 losers stumble upon each other with their collective problems that include mental illness, alcoholism, laziness, indebtedness etc and together they conspire to kidnap a child and outwit each other.<br /><br />Would have been a much better movie if the story was confined more to the kidnap instead of the character failings of the kidnappers.

{"value":"Simon Pegg stars as Sidney Young, a stereotypically clumsy idiot Brit working as a celebrity journalist in this US comedy. After getting a very lucky break he starts work at the highly respected Sharps magazine run by a reliably on form Jeff Bridges in New York. It's more The Devil Wears Prada than Shaun of the Dead. The unlikely love interest is provided by Kirsten Dunst who works well with Pegg for the laughs but they don't exactly set the screen ablaze with their passion.<br /><br />Sidney goes through some emotional challenges while trying to decide if he should forget about his journalistic principles in order to get material in the magazine. Of course he's eventually seduced by the glitz and glamour of the world of celebrities especially the young starlet Sophie Maes (Transformers' Megan Fox). Fans of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Spaced will wonder if Pegg himself ever experienced similar feelings in real life with this film and to an extent Run Fat Boy Run as one of the UK's best comic talents being ruined by the US.<br /><br />All in all this is a forgettable comedy.

{"value":"this, is NOT one of those films it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe I have ever scene, the camera work is trying to be flashy but it really just crap the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries, but without the sex, the only reason I bought this was I wanted to try out dvd and this was the cheapest one I could find, possibly the worst buy of my life and could have put you off dvd forever, the soundtrack is REALLY tacky and most of the movie is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films, why anyone would want to make a movie as awful as this is beyond me, if they had really attempted to make an original movie and failed I would be nicer in this review but they don't they just got the rights to reproduce stuff from the first two and then edit it and repeat it into this film with about maybe under 1 3rd original footage which is about up to the standards of film school students, DO NOT buy this movie. the only entertainment this dvd can offer is if you were to stick it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights!

{"value":"I really wanted to like The Pillow Book. Intriguing story, interesting character outlines, Ewan Macgregor in the utterly glorious altogether. Unfortunately, I hated every minute of it. Greenaway got so enamoured with presenting the movie uniquely, and not to the film's benefit. I won't even get into Vivian Wu's abysmal acting.<br /><br />You get distracted from the story with 4 billion teeny windows and calligraphy that rolls on the bottom of the screen displaying the lyrics of the music that's playing. It seems he lost sight of presenting the actual story and developing the plot, and got entangled with foo-foo embellishments that have nothing to do with anything. It's a bit like presenting a John Singer Sargeant portrait in a chintzy Hallmark frame that says \"GRANDMA LOVES ME!\" in big sparkly letters.<br /><br />This movie seems to be a casualty of the director auteur's ego instead of what it could have been - disturbingly and horrifyingly beautiful. In another director's hands (Jeunet? Coppola?), it could have been a masterpiece.

{"value":"this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i love Japanese movies, and i think another film by the same director, electric dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. i really wanted to like this movie - asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing. but i couldn't find anything entertaining about it.<br /><br />the movie takes forever for nothing to happen. and the effects the director used - like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion - merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind-bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting. a lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary - like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn't worship anything. this added nothing to the plot. a fellow Japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly. we couldn't believe this film was as terrible as it was. and the finale was awful. i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this, but sadly i was
