{"value":"At first I was convinced that this was a made-for-TV movie that wasn't worthy of primetime. But after a few minutes of dumb-struck awe, I realized that there was at least comic value in the over-the-top stunts and c-movie acting. This movie would have gotten a 1 if my wife and I hadn't laughed so hard as we watched it in wonder that the actors could keep a straight face. It was like a less-funny spy version of The Big Hit (I laughed so much I actually bought the Big Hit DVD) with even-worse acting. We were disappointed that Nick chose to marry Elena, and not Jim, after all of the hugging and high-fives. A few rum and cokes will definitely help it go down easier.","finished_norm":["at","i","be","convinc","that","thi","be","a","madefortv","movi","that","be","not","worthi","of","primetim","but","after","a","few","minut","of","dumbstruck","aw","i","realiz","that","there","be","at","littl","comic","valu","in","the","overthetop","stunt","and","cmovi","act","thi","movi","would","have","get","a","if","my","wife","and","i","have","not","laugh","so","hard","a","we","watch","it","in","wonder","that","the","actor","can","keep","a","straight","face","it","be","like","a","lessfunni","spy","version","of","the","big","hit","i","laugh","so","much","i","actual","bui","the","big","hit","dvd","with","evenwors","act","we","be","disappoint","that","nick","choos","to","marri","elena","and","not","jim","after","all","of","the","hug","and","highfiv","a","few","rum","and","coke","will","definit","help","it","go","down","easi"],"filtered":["convinc","thi","madefortv","movi","worthi","primetim","minut","dumbstruck","aw","realiz","littl","comic","valu","overthetop","stunt","cmovi","act","thi","movi","get","wife","laugh","hard","watch","wonder","actor","keep","straight","face","like","lessfunni","spy","version","big","hit","laugh","much","actual","bui","big","hit","dvd","evenwors","act","disappoint","nick","choos","marri","elena","jim","hug","highfiv","rum","coke","definit","help","go","easi"],"filtered2":["convinc","madefortv","worthi","primetim","minut","dumbstruck","aw","realiz","littl","comic","valu","overthetop","stunt","cmovi","act","get","wife","laugh","hard","watch","wonder","actor","keep","straight","face","like","lessfunni","spy","version","big","hit","laugh","actual","bui","big","hit","dvd","evenwors","act","disappoint","nick","choos","marri","elena","jim","hug","highfiv","rum","coke","definit","help","go","easi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,7,14,21,41,52,59,82,133,134,138,171,175,185,187,220,247,251,263,347,388,392,405,451,478,480,548,584,733,744,1337,1358,1443,1546,1921,2172,2642,4720,4765],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,7,14,21,41,52,59,82,133,134,138,171,175,185,187,220,247,251,263,347,388,392,405,451,478,480,548,584,733,744,1337,1358,1443,1546,1921,2172,2642,4720,4765],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1175081997259209,2.324031090670098,1.5687599167621034,1.7122153074726136,1.8693254449200722,4.040393168790646,4.642472950759303,2.2443961816702407,2.2907365189289424,2.373087554090762,2.3791142619576227,2.518833027372001,2.4732161909892554,2.8336934208777267,2.7303758068497004,2.6942272927333892,2.902686292364678,3.0151989841543516,6.182885002738823,3.0670934723591254,3.109204957709252,3.216957819005698,3.3243163373261977,3.43462735814388,3.459754308221302,3.5146700658174166,3.7636829971100436,3.700222643192818,4.396611317676934,4.798834931860927,4.900964426937307,4.6973654716960676,4.869215728622727,5.259176650194926,5.3064295350454715,6.214688095222362,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.253298699025206E-5,9.190901542653038E-5,9.262352038170855E-5,9.208834069419163E-5,9.208984945797399E-5,9.196112625149997E-5,9.223463152591813E-5,9.19222497242003E-5,9.212892445121477E-5,1.0221201255879408E-4,0.7035380226914365,9.177386694652798E-5,9.348678066269285E-5,0.13129085635187973,9.184078749292962E-5,9.158697918186785E-5,9.387150181164884E-5,9.224327321467592E-5,9.19570888188661E-5,9.203330489580495E-5,9.292378109929046E-5,9.233466295650058E-5,9.243979997803846E-5,9.253939349454878E-5,9.324958579779332E-5,9.276191671583833E-5,9.66614514728316E-5,9.180115047569993E-5,9.180360637146221E-5,9.203619028905347E-5,9.399239796774196E-5,9.223792850468269E-5,9.900960261610903E-5,9.24973801863297E-5,9.190107189958659E-5,9.232525592821351E-5,9.18089847289522E-5,9.186323708410967E-5,9.158651904147933E-5,9.161028080993612E-5,0.040692863846177124,9.278495377546858E-5,9.231347443416275E-5,9.194849276146895E-5,9.306576336240346E-5,9.198378309544101E-5,9.50399474340549E-5,9.36423573044816E-5,9.163305097286317E-5,9.183556561925886E-5,9.180371358518149E-5,9.43874151795019E-5,9.183693195739856E-5,9.160214791039561E-5,9.260761257648544E-5,9.186058671312708E-5,0.05379735448408587,9.178488165354358E-5,9.163199128919689E-5,9.206950715361387E-5,9.298275928571713E-5,0.06373525999872212,9.161503916595368E-5,9.182835075313886E-5,9.158762679663943E-5,9.370677464783393E-5,9.237661120837391E-5,9.217983550137396E-5,9.209922006911637E-5,9.243493636627034E-5,9.15842855347606E-5,9.210115088612169E-5,9.359497041264252E-5,9.174840966157164E-5,9.401913499674174E-5,9.199098313555565E-5,9.271095069672307E-5,9.214434215100525E-5,9.155557116387597E-5,9.166906058242351E-5]}}
{"value":"Being a big fan of the \"other\" PLANET OF THE APES films, I rented this DVD despite my aversion to all things Tim Burton. Once again, he doesn't fail to disappoint with his uninspired direction. Even the ape makeup looks second rate, which is unforgivable considering the monstrous budget of this monstrosity. Mark Wahlberg proves once and for all that he is not an actor (as if BOOGIE NIGHTS wasn't proof enough). I was embarrassed for genuine talents such as Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter. No doubt their paychecks motivated them since it couldn't possibly have been the cliche-ridden screenplay. I rented this DVD on a special $1 night and I still feel ripped off.","finished_norm":["be","a","big","fan","of","the","other","planet","of","the","ap","film","i","rent","thi","dvd","despit","my","avers","to","all","thing","tim","burton","onc","again","he","doe","not","fail","to","disappoint","with","hi","uninspir","direct","even","the","ap","makeup","look","rate","which","be","unforgiv","consid","the","monstrou","budget","of","thi","monstros","mark","wahlberg","prove","onc","and","for","all","that","he","be","not","a","actor","a","if","boogi","night","be","not","proof","enough","i","be","embarrass","for","genuin","talent","such","a","tim","roth","and","helena","bonham","carter","no","doubt","their","paycheck","motiv","them","sinc","it","can","not","possibli","have","be","the","clicheridden","screenplai","i","rent","thi","dvd","on","a","special","night","and","i","still","feel","rip","off"],"filtered":["big","fan","planet","ap","film","rent","thi","dvd","despit","avers","thing","tim","burton","onc","doe","fail","disappoint","hi","uninspir","direct","even","ap","makeup","look","rate","unforgiv","consid","monstrou","budget","thi","monstros","mark","wahlberg","prove","onc","actor","boogi","night","proof","enough","embarrass","genuin","talent","tim","roth","helena","bonham","carter","doubt","paycheck","motiv","sinc","possibli","clicheridden","screenplai","rent","thi","dvd","special","night","still","feel","rip"],"filtered2":["big","fan","planet","ap","rent","dvd","despit","avers","thing","tim","burton","onc","doe","fail","disappoint","uninspir","direct","even","ap","makeup","look","rate","unforgiv","consid","monstrou","budget","monstros","mark","wahlberg","prove","onc","actor","boogi","night","proof","enough","embarrass","genuin","talent","tim","roth","helena","bonham","carter","doubt","paycheck","motiv","sinc","possibli","clicheridden","screenplai","rent","dvd","special","night","still","feel","rip"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,16,18,29,41,43,64,82,93,102,140,162,187,202,203,210,215,236,247,256,276,317,391,540,557,558,567,661,703,717,824,902,960,1008,1166,1441,1445,1549,1976,2095,3335,3439,3636,4688,4934,5770,6200,6358,7025,7758],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,16,18,29,41,43,64,82,93,102,140,162,187,202,203,210,215,236,247,256,276,317,391,540,557,558,567,661,703,717,824,902,960,1008,1166,1441,1445,1549,1976,2095,3335,3439,3636,4688,4934,5770,6200,6358,7025,7758],"values":[0.926017105726131,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.3195384777338066,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.883428577602134,2.020196584395323,2.035389827120098,2.087553710177271,2.317169775997098,2.3586007221245198,2.4732161909892554,2.597304642813496,2.569760528637609,5.374303583034378,2.605934685587711,5.235847860032464,5.460751613699401,2.748952192422636,2.7884729505849193,2.8529247828056143,3.109204957709252,3.432149042129413,3.43462735814388,3.4572130107926293,3.454678155189441,7.145555393249395,3.6746621462132825,3.7398317812878634,3.8767358583910254,3.9201351739255808,4.058285512406398,4.358390104856736,4.246178114249808,10.258997653772786,9.597669863721855,4.528289141652134,4.956227105612356,5.541743621979936,5.999576715605417,5.7446844659766265,5.649374286172302,6.032366538428407,6.101359409915359,6.437831646536572,6.437831646536572,7.0356686472921925,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.989678109019957E-5,5.949288309258403E-5,5.9955383529241045E-5,5.9608960684482997E-5,5.960993731019162E-5,5.952661453017355E-5,5.970365502223684E-5,5.950144967901122E-5,5.963523062874071E-5,0.07904431640713105,0.16354147675352654,5.9405401220608696E-5,6.0514173575426713E-5,6.137742155862434E-5,5.944871901946758E-5,5.928442840980487E-5,6.076320431775231E-5,5.970924880405033E-5,5.95240010922364E-5,5.957333590595469E-5,6.014974287130881E-5,5.976840556033811E-5,5.983646095731987E-5,5.990092803279696E-5,6.0360636881532855E-5,6.00449677434622E-5,0.2794774993730368,5.9423061901705614E-5,5.942465160777302E-5,5.9575203626573974E-5,6.084146063295069E-5,5.9705789162955116E-5,6.408910688627689E-5,5.987373273729074E-5,5.948774123226035E-5,5.9762316372770004E-5,5.942813302895784E-5,5.9463250683171646E-5,5.9284130560043195E-5,5.9299511598631334E-5,5.943298759239216E-5,6.005987967662805E-5,5.975469018892977E-5,5.951843684769073E-5,6.024164826428252E-5,5.954128034898986E-5,6.1519541424523E-5,6.061487863595774E-5,5.9314250769046026E-5,5.9445338890561E-5,5.942472100742046E-5,6.109715603660321E-5,5.944622332387619E-5,5.929424715706026E-5,5.9945086376214154E-5,5.946153509291875E-5,6.394434600069426E-5,5.941253106172098E-5,5.9313564833763386E-5,5.959676969731366E-5,6.0187919565225186E-5,5.959282703200614E-5,5.9302591691666294E-5,5.944066869379505E-5,5.928484761209657E-5,6.065657610665101E-5,5.979555874474614E-5,5.9668185449779596E-5,5.9616002

{"value":"This is the worst sequel on the face of the world of movies. Once again it doesn't make since. The killer still kills for fun.

If you value the one precious hour during this movie then don't watch it. You'll want to ask the director and the person beside you what made him make it. Because it just doesn't combine the original makes of horror, action, and crime.<br /><br />Don't let your children watch this. Teenager, young child or young adult, this movie has that sorta impact upon people.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","wrong","sequel","on","the","face","of","the","world","of","movi","onc","again","it","doe","not","make","sinc","the","killer","still","kill","for","fun","but","thi","time","he","be","kill","peopl","that","be","make","a","movi","about","what","happen","in","the","movi","which","mean","that","it","be","the","stupid","movi","everbr","br","do","not","watch","thi","if","you","valu","the","on","preciou","hour","dure","thi","movi","then","do","not","watch","it","you","will","want","to","ask","the","director","and","the","person","besid","you","what","make","him","make","it","becaus","it","just","doe","not","combin","the","origin","make","of","horror","action","and","crimebr","br","do","not","let","your","child","watch","thi","teenag","young","child","or","young","adult","thi","movi","have","that","sorta","impact","upon","peopl"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","sequel","face","world","movi","onc","doe","make","sinc","killer","still","kill","fun","thi","time","kill","peopl","make","movi","happen","movi","mean","stupid","movi","everbr","br","watch","thi","valu","preciou","hour","dure","thi","movi","watch","want","ask","director","person","besid","make","make","becaus","doe","combin","origin","make","horror","action","crimebr","br","let","child","watch","thi","teenag","young","child","young","adult","thi","movi","sorta","impact","upon","peopl"],"filtered2":["wrong","sequel","face","world","onc","doe","make","sinc","killer","still","kill","fun","time","kill","peopl","make","happen","mean","stupid","everbr","watch","valu","preciou","hour","dure","watch","want","ask","director","person","besid","make","make","becaus","doe","combin","origin","make","horror","action","crimebr","let","child","watch","teenag","young","child","young","adult","sorta","impact","upon","peopl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,18,22,23,25,37,58,64,69,76,83,88,94,124,129,135,136,153,162,165,174,180,236,239,251,252,259,306,387,451,630,692,734,968,972,1796,2540,4329,6493],"values":[5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,18,22,23,25,37,58,64,69,76,83,88,94,124,129,135,136,153,162,165,174,180,236,239,251,252,259,306,387,451,630,692,734,968,972,1796,2540,4329,6493],"values":[3.099883578102616,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,2.430631986809635,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,1.2796387880827016,1.4876543214774305,1.865701314626681,1.883428577602134,2.127032521151058,4.267533106664805,2.292318797740072,2.0317223413467334,2.08112281984698,2.2323930368088845,2.4106958340079214,4.732488142874176,2.346825985579986,2.3409902041158843,2.3586007221245198,2.448847599972298,2.456282578459816,5.419462958538709,2.617923930016232,2.6593400337329487,2.6942272927333892,3.0433232530252132,2.7464553122240485,2.8739486825973213,3.360519385990158,3.216957819005698,3.558633189238533,3.753391311073496,3.79165684915245,3.9911462095687695,3.9911462095687695,4.77960356993304,5.156897801074508,5.907203395474402,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.86859160685177E-5,9.802045386558387E-5,9.878246942706877E-5,9.821170326635428E-5,9.821331235453826E-5,9.807602977063655E-5,9.836772162489789E-5,9.803456817045567E-5,9.825498561754168E-5,1.0900854301433108E-4,0.9921899237678674,9.787631876319375E-5,9.970313171632867E-5,1.0112541879863231E-4,9.794768915379993E-5,9.767700400142748E-5,1.001134346823364E-4,9.837693793790345E-5,9.807172387118384E-5,9.815300789341745E-5,9.910269581268285E-5,9.847440458936022E-5,9.858653263818537E-5,9.86927485697249E-5,9.945016471190434E-5,9.893006834782512E-5,1.0308890048166131E-4,9.790541649533763E-5,9.790803569451138E-5,9.815608514927194E-5,1.0024236976053149E-4,9.837123783441649E-5,1.0559319061838934E-4,9.864794161013648E-5,9.801198213827061E-5,9.846437204600256E-5,9.791377168286653E-5,9.797163151795596E-5,9.767651326426187E-5,9.770185505818682E-5,9.7921770059923E-5,9.895463724381653E-5,9.845180714811185E-5,9.806255622377065E-5,9.925411910675919E-5,9.810019316870969E-5,1.0135957544115076E-4,9.986905333966723E-5,9.77261393103284E-5,9.794212005456781E-5,9.79081500373468E-5,1.0066365342026537E-4,9.794357724659588E-5,9.769318136605221E-5,9.876550384125831E-5,9.796880491204119E-5,1.0535468263274152E-4,9.78880658869754E-5,9.772500916359099E-5,9.819161740005749E-5,9.916559572054152E-5,9.818512146604331E-5,9.770692981841931E-5,9.793442543997119E-5,9.767769467898012E-5,9.99377540781411E-5,9.851914216671766E-5,9.830928196943077E-5,9.822330605921359E-5,9.858134562328021E-5,9.76741312417664E-5,9.822536526481289E-5,9.981851548302944E-5,9.784916871035044E-5,1.0027088465328073E-4,9.810787197145404E-5,9.887571337185007E-5,9.827142850863361E-5,9.764350752489257E-5,9.776454335868259E-5]}}
{"value":"For the life of me, I cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the \"Jerry Springer Show\". It's so incrediably trashy. Some ways, sadly it's a guilty pleasure. We all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. It's part of our pop culture. I saw this on USA recently. It's pretty bad. I will admit that. Jerry does a horrible job of what I think he meant as acting. Or something like it. Jamie Pressley is in it. She's playing herself basically. All she needed was her lover boy, Kid Rock. It would've been perfect then. So, I would recommend skipping \"Ringmaster\". Just watch the \"Jerry Springer Show\".

{"value":"This movie has a slew of great adult stars but fails to get you interested in a way an adult film should. Among all the stars you couldn't get your kicks from any of the scenes. The movie is shot in a dream like middle age set which is embarrassingly cheesy. The acting is worse than Keanu Reeves, the sex scenes are as exciting as listening to your neighbor talk about their kid in college, and the dialogue is the worse I have seen in a movie. The plot also was worse by ten fold. I'd stick to the amateur route. The audio commentary was useless since it's a skin flick but even then that was bad too.

{"value":"Down to Earth is about Lance Barton, a black comedian who gets hit by a truck. He goes to Heaven and he gets to get another body. Lance gets the body of Charles Wellington, a white guy. So Lance does a few things in the body of Charles. The movie has a few laughs, but it's nothing special. It's a good movie if you're a fan of Chris Rock. Madagascar, the 2005 animated comedy, is better. This is a good movie, but Chris Rock has done way better things than this. It will only make you laugh about 4 times the whole movie. And it's not really laugh-out-loud funny. You'll laugh to yourself and you might giggle, but you definitely won't be rolling on the floor laughing.","finished_norm":["down","to","earth","be","about","lanc","barton","a","black","comedian","who","get","hit","by","a","truck","he","go","to","heaven","and","he","get","to","get","anoth","bodi","lanc","get","the","bodi","of","charl","wellington","a","white","gui","so","lanc","doe","a","few","thing","in","the","bodi","of","charl","the","movi","have","a","few","laugh","but","it","noth","special","it","a","good","movi","if","you","re","a","fan","of","chri","rock","madagascar","the","anim","comedi","be","well","thi","be","a","good","movi","but","chri","rock","have","do","wai","well","thing","than","thi","it","will","onli","make","you","laugh","about","time","the","whole","movi","and","it","not","realli","laughoutloud","funni","you","will","laugh","to","yourself","and","you","mai","giggl","but","you","definit","wo","not","be","roll","on","the","floor","laugh"],"filtered":["earth","lanc","barton","black","comedian","get","hit","truck","go","heaven","get","get","anoth","bodi","lanc","get","bodi","charl","wellington","white","gui","lanc","doe","thing","bodi","charl","movi","laugh","noth","special","good","movi","re","fan","chri","rock","madagascar","anim","comedi","well","thi","good","movi","chri","rock","wai","well","thing","thi","onli","make","laugh","time","whole","movi","realli","laughoutloud","funni","laugh","mai","giggl","definit","wo","roll","floor","laugh"],"filtered2":["earth","lanc","barton","black","comedian","get","hit","truck","go","heaven","get","get","anoth","bodi","lanc","get","bodi","charl","wellington","white","gui","lanc","doe","thing","bodi","charl","laugh","noth","special","good","re","fan","chri","rock","madagascar","anim","comedi","well","good","chri","rock","wai","well","thing","onli","make","laugh","time","whole","realli","laughoutloud","funni","laugh","mai","giggl","definit","wo","roll","floor","laugh"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,6,8,11,13,18,20,29,33,46,49,55,62,68,73,111,127,133,140,203,229,277,359,376,388,392,406,522,582,795,1140,1223,1237,1543,1634,1718,2873,3687,4877,8124],"values":[1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,6,8,11,13,18,20,29,33,46,49,55,62,68,73,111,127,133,140,203,229,277,359,376,388,392,406,522,582,795,1140,1223,1237,1543,1634,1718,2873,3687,4877,8124],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,3.1865361882879695,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,2.6390769554676132,1.4018535447685214,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,1.9536997889255368,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,1.8950689206770979,2.1183455303375887,2.4359679371086367,9.284945901518606,2.317169775997098,2.569760528637609,2.8432628718938773,3.1163992333432793,3.2189558216683714,9.470761292246756,3.0914425013694116,3.0670934723591254,3.121829110937649,3.604618302480356,7.419957636276365,3.784589681929357,9.116733193778822,9.086429583737619,4.429617614145104,4.706176101378222,4.828393734102471,4.956227105612356,5.426230734858092,19.46737482277237,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.448926444622376E-5,7.398696592189442E-5,7.456214403172903E-5,7.413132316917659E-5,7.413253772744416E-5,7.402891525421286E-5,0.24955334691994055,7.399761956154186E-5,7.416399318564797E-5,8.228090198660532E-5,0.5451687565009665,7.387817108889651E-5,7.525707051630189E-5,7.633062916390673E-5,7.393204228056486E-5,7.372772601437406E-5,7.556677191398461E-5,7.425604419964424E-5,7.402566511178333E-5,7.408701922662185E-5,7.480385459054985E-5,7.432961314913863E-5,7.441424868998902E-5,7.449442169671632E-5,7.506612811196073E-5,7.467355339466754E-5,7.781268772047844E-5,7.390013439177496E-5,7.390211139343502E-5,7.408934197473267E-5,7.566409359390295E-5,7.425174169597476E-5,7.97029547178004E-5,7.446060088828915E-5,7.39805713646841E-5,7.432204047002686E-5,7.390644098341572E-5,7.395011425239363E-5,7.372735560031743E-5,7.374648387783078E-5,7.391247825040817E-5,7.469209827993147E-5,7.431255634058867E-5,7.401874526607773E-5,7.491815063445482E-5,7.40471540649844E-5,7.650737329074127E-5,7.538231006588088E-5,7.376481391064314E-5,7.392783866041363E-5,7.390219770072226E-5,0.06263054149597441,7.392893856571573E-5,7.373993687525048E-5,7.454933821243621E-5,7.394798069774005E-5,7.952292614712653E-5,7.388703795303186E-5,7.37639608628878E-5,7.411616212628598E-5,0.13697730222167964,7.411125892058161E-5,7.375031436521965E-5,7.392203067681948E-5,7.372824734573436E-5,7.543416617341582E-5,7.436338158705988E-5,7.420497669652224E-5,7.414008109067181E-5,7.441033347148217E-5,7.372555762234195E-5,7.414163540274131E-5,7.534416351044917E-5,7.385767791675459E-5,7.568561696290303E-5,7.405295011361059E-5,7.463252563365895E-5,7.417640446895569E-5,7.370244248863881E-5,7.379380172803012E-5]}}
{"value":"When I refer to Malice as a film noir I am not likening it to such masterpieces as Sunset Boulevard, Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon, nor am I comparing director Becker to Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Stanley Kramer or Luis Bunuel. I am merely registering a protest against the darkness that pervades this movie from start to finish, to the extent that most of the time you simply cannot make out what is going on. I can understand darkness in night scenes but this movie was dark even in broad daylight, for what reason I am at loss to understand. As it is, however, it wouldn't have made much difference if director Becker had filmed it in total darkness.","finished_norm":["when","i","refer","to","malic","a","a","film","noir","i","be","not","liken","it","to","such","masterpiec","a","sunset","boulevard","doubl","indemn","or","the","maltes","falcon","nor","be","i","compar","director","becker","to","alfr","hitchcock","stanlei","kubrick","stanlei","kramer","or","lui","bunuel","i","be","mere","regist","a","protest","against","the","dark","that","pervad","thi","movi","from","start","to","finish","to","the","extent","that","much","of","the","time","you","simpli","cannot","make","out","what","be","go","on","i","can","understand","dark","in","night","scene","but","thi","movi","be","dark","even","in","broad","daylight","for","what","reason","i","be","at","loss","to","understand","a","it","be","howev","it","would","not","have","make","much","differ","if","director","becker","have","film","it","in","total","dark"],"filtered":["refer","malic","film","noir","liken","masterpiec","sunset","boulevard","doubl","indemn","maltes","falcon","compar","director","becker","alfr","hitchcock","stanlei","kubrick","stanlei","kramer","lui","bunuel","mere","regist","protest","dark","pervad","thi","movi","start","finish","extent","much","time","simpli","make","go","understand","dark","night","scene","thi","movi","dark","even","broad","daylight","reason","loss","understand","howev","make","much","differ","director","becker","film","total","dark"],"filtered2":["refer","malic","noir","liken","masterpiec","sunset","boulevard","doubl","indemn","maltes","falcon","compar","director","becker","alfr","hitchcock","stanlei","kubrick","stanlei","kramer","lui","bunuel","mere","regist","protest","dark","pervad","start","finish","extent","time","simpli","make","go","understand","dark","night","scene","dark","even","broad","daylight","reason","loss","understand","howev","make","differ","director","becker","total","dark"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,8,19,58,71,95,113,184,201,204,210,212,368,482,573,715,836,1174,1307,1598,2354,2485,2534,2556,3197,3379,3446,3648,3966,4364,4775,5271,6502,7351],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,8,19,58,71,95,113,184,201,204,210,212,368,482,573,715,836,1174,1307,1598,2354,2485,2534,2556,3197,3379,3446,3648,3966,4364,4775,5271,6502,7351],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.312380678011735,3.731402629253362,1.9214926742550966,2.0323326556775485,2.1521782565202803,2.496249838866882,2.561435818751577,2.624524614047584,2.687151791517189,5.196758667886523,12.538458692938482,3.3154667220492153,3.4623020803001006,3.68099128126493,3.8463152616903136,4.235066888824737,4.436351646326448,4.662879295624898,5.102830579804232,5.390512652256013,5.426230734858092,5.214056214914456,5.626901430320244,6.101359409915359,11.756431717202299,5.719991853386255,5.850044981634453,5.9370563586240825,6.543192162194399,6.342521466732247,6.489124940924123,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.708669405359702E-5,7.65668804541957E-5,7.716211493944367E-5,7.671627141728802E-5,7.671752832702231E-5,7.661029255351262E-5,7.683814229766212E-5,7.657790558467814E-5,7.675008063239007E-5,0.08630639505405478,0.22023934296379646,7.645429196150121E-5,7.788127340750295E-5,7.899226688598269E-5,7.651004163363602E-5,7.629860088953533E-5,7.820177404700617E-5,7.68453414515968E-5,7.660692907909845E-5,7.667042260282496E-5,7.741225390961426E-5,0.13626385762068172,7.700906250906431E-5,7.709203113664965E-5,7.768367286983176E-5,7.727740913035016E-5,8.052600460469031E-5,7.647702112149472E-5,7.647906706090954E-5,7.667282634481803E-5,7.830248931947422E-5,7.684088892026226E-5,0.08174107204154941,7.705703100164693E-5,7.656026291972352E-5,7.691363900214297E-5,7.648354762305097E-5,7.652874377244309E-5,7.629821755919547E-5,7.631801283690973E-5,7.648979540864836E-5,7.729660067301374E-5,7.690382416251741E-5,7.659976793939903E-5,7.753053543962455E-5,7.662916734891167E-5,0.2742199157033103,7.80108800416076E-5,7.633698203524861E-5,7.650569143387335E-5,7.647915637771911E-5,0.15032474080284197,7.650682969271028E-5,7.63112375413201E-5,7.71488625831307E-5,7.652653582105507E-5,8.229587879171364E-5,7.646346801187435E-5,7.63360992418445E-5,7.670058171107961E-5,7.746138701944662E-5,7.66955075313193E-5,7.632197689282593E-5,7.649968092675238E-5,7.629914039964286E-5,7.806454436392403E-5,0.04528329480162311,7.679249323221225E-5,7.672533472620732E-5,7.700501076746861E-5,7.629635688599454E-5,7.672694323690824E-5,7.797140332144363E-5,7.643308419548505E-5,7.832476320516026E-5,7.663516550489413E-5,7.723495073739802E-5,7.676292469530661E-5,7.627243573100625E-5,7.63669806535301E-5]}}
{"value":"...And I never thought a movie deserved to be awarded a 1! But this one is honestly the worst movie I've ever watched. My wife picked it up because of the cast, but the storyline right since the DVD box seemed quite predictable. It is not a mystery, nor a juvenile-catching film. It does not include any sensuality, if that's what the title could remotely have suggest any of you. This is just a total no-no. Don't waste your time or money unless you feel like watching a bunch of youngsters in a as-grown-up kind of Gothic setting, where a killer is going after them. Nothing new, nothing interesting, nothing worth watching.

{"value":"What is it with Americans and their hang-up with religious gobbledy-gook? To think this was a best-selling novel is incredible, but to pull it off as a movie you really need good acting and a script that delivers. In this case, all the good actors have gone to heaven and we're left with Kirk Cameron as a CNN-type journalist(!) trying to discover why a lot of people have simply disappeared. Oh yeah, there's a subplot about an evil world conspiracy and famine, or something. The good news is that this is done so cheaply, and with such inane dialogue, that it has sheer entertainment value in all of its unintended laughs.

{"value":"This movie was different in that it didn't show the typical gay stereotypes that I'm used to seeing. But that doesn't change the fact that it totally lacks a storyline. I'm sure that there are many gay men who are just happy to see themselves depicted on screen, since Black gay characters are seldom seen, and when they are the characters are usually not fully developed. But, how hard would it have been for the writer to actually script a story with a beginning, middle and end. Or how about a story that was focused. There really doesn't seem to be a point to this film, and even though it is a low budget film, that is still no excuse for the lack of story or plot.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","differ","in","that","it","do","not","show","the","typic","gai","stereotyp","that","i","be","us","to","see","but","that","doe","not","chang","the","fact","that","it","total","lack","a","storylin","i","be","sure","that","there","be","mani","gai","man","who","be","just","happi","to","see","themselv","depict","on","screen","sinc","black","gai","charact","be","seldom","see","and","when","thei","be","the","charact","be","usual","not","fulli","develop","but","how","hard","would","it","have","be","for","the","writer","to","actual","script","a","stori","with","a","begin","middl","and","end","or","how","about","a","stori","that","be","focu","there","realli","doe","not","seem","to","be","a","point","to","thi","film","and","even","though","it","be","a","low","budget","film","that","be","still","no","excus","for","the","lack","of","stori","or","plot"],"filtered":["thi","movi","differ","show","typic","gai","stereotyp","us","see","doe","chang","fact","total","lack","storylin","sure","mani","gai","man","happi","see","themselv","depict","screen","sinc","black","gai","charact","seldom","see","thei","charact","usual","fulli","develop","hard","writer","actual","script","stori","begin","middl","end","stori","focu","realli","doe","seem","point","thi","film","even","though","low","budget","film","still","excus","lack","stori","plot"],"filtered2":["differ","show","typic","gai","stereotyp","us","see","doe","chang","fact","total","lack","storylin","sure","mani","gai","man","happi","see","themselv","depict","screen","sinc","black","gai","charact","seldom","see","charact","usual","fulli","develop","hard","writer","actual","script","stori","begin","middl","end","stori","focu","realli","doe","seem","point","even","though","low","budget","still","excus","lack","stori","plot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,10,13,17,18,24,28,32,35,45,50,52,56,64,66,77,86,97,119,147,162,171,183,184,192,204,217,229,256,265,278,287,320,436,515,554,604,605,613,617,619,640,1011,1366,5406],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,10,13,17,18,24,28,32,35,45,50,52,56,64,66,77,86,97,119,147,162,171,183,184,192,204,217,229,256,265,278,287,320,436,515,554,604,605,613,617,619,640,1011,1366,5406],"values":[1.967100616408184,0.926017105726131,2.247774048205673,1.1317941569733974,3.83116108203179,2.430631986809635,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.8162961064622165,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,1.8610609350701788,1.883428577602134,1.929723173391612,1.9463902258768238,2.031112399272319,2.0545557924622586,2.1653408989309972,2.2844323215331563,2.3586007221245198,2.373087554090762,4.977025712729459,2.496249838866882,2.5318267134339894,2.624524614047584,2.6113665294700725,2.8432628718938773,2.748952192422636,2.73529586597515,2.8336934208777267,2.841890188081905,2.938298364153555,3.2070272508030975,3.3956930001684253,3.439602492783994,3.5727776966246974,3.5474598886404074,3.5364100524538222,3.5119855004467477,3.5929222627171646,11.99952574960897,4.086456389373095,4.416284083275639,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.352802222981069E-5,9.289734091084841E-5,9.361952915425023E-5,9.307859451743472E-5,9.30801195054111E-5,9.295001209930452E-5,9.322645845878978E-5,9.291071752093017E-5,9.311961468389093E-5,1.0331112929229932E-4,0.9925981232930119,9.276073913830086E-5,9.449207233453812E-5,9.584002250970301E-5,9.282837930160977E-5,9.257184171289455E-5,9.488093050655007E-5,9.323519307424455E-5,9.294593125093449E-5,9.302296690243634E-5,9.392301866628445E-5,9.332756555764719E-5,9.343383314942618E-5,9.353449762518879E-5,9.425232684140433E-5,9.375941370608447E-5,9.770088134158194E-5,9.278831605552682E-5,9.279079836028017E-5,9.302588332319252E-5,9.500312669563198E-5,9.322979089096573E-5,1.0007428286541415E-4,9.34920325351396E-5,9.28893119647531E-5,9.331805737273534E-5,9.279623455287748E-5,9.285107030004429E-5,9.257137662447704E-5,9.259539391042807E-5,9.28038148887242E-5,9.37826984901954E-5,9.330614918871016E-5,9.293724275752821E-5,9.406652770768251E-5,9.297291257915175E-5,9.606194077868395E-5,9.46493219390839E-5,9.26184089278147E-5,9.282310127554961E-5,9.279090672690107E-5,9.540239164713014E-5,9.282448230633722E-5,9.258717355535515E-5,9.36034502875787E-5,9.284839142881967E-5,9.984824067953454E-5,9.27718722897976E-5,9.261733784904895E-5,9.305955845409001E-5,9.398263106301565E-5,9.305340203496674E-5,9.26002034344893E-5,9.281580882578865E-5,9.257249629166395E-5,9.471443198164287E-5,9.336996489178003E-5,9.317107319599467E-5,9.308959088157365E-5,9.342891723776743E-5,9.256911910018398E-5,9.309154246123913E-5,9.460142548164227E-5,9.273500810344773E-5,9.50301512360039E-5,9.29801900434788E-5,9.370789963392683E-5,9.313519817487764E-5,9.254009595497097E-5,9.265480575

{"value":"S.I.C.K. really stands for So Incredibly Crappy i Killed myself. There was absolutely no acting to speak of. The best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the box.The budgeting of this movie was sufficient. The filming was sub sesame street. The production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits. The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store. The ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh. If there is a book out there for this movie I'm sure it's better. I would avoid this at all costs. I did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth it. just

{"value":"It's one of those dramas that's so bad that it almost hits the point of being very funny, the script is absolutely dire, direction appalling, lighting purely armature, the only thing letting it down from a true so bad it's good feel is that the sound design is only quite bad; it adds no suspense to the story although trying hard, but doesn't at least destroy any speeches. There's continuity problems of seasons of out door shots throughout. And finally last but not least the acting is appalling. For a professional production it very much has the feel of a university media project you have to feel sorry for the sorry for anyone who had to put their names to

{"value":"I saw this movie in the theater when I was a kid and always remember it as my first experience with getting ripped off by a horrible movie with a good commercial. The commercial was great, but it I found out later that it had every explosion or 'special effect' in the entire movie (about 4) and even some that weren't in the movie. There was some sort of plot relating to the aliens but the aliens were never actually shown in the movie as far as I remember. It was clearly a case of someone making a buck off a cheap movie designed to scam people. I guess my world of innocence ended that day, when I found out there were bad people out there who make bad bad movies.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","movi","in","the","theater","when","i","be","a","kid","and","alwai","rememb","it","a","my","experi","with","get","rip","off","by","a","horribl","movi","with","a","good","commerci","the","commerci","be","great","but","it","i","find","out","late","that","it","have","everi","explos","or","special","effect","in","the","entir","movi","about","and","even","some","that","be","not","in","the","movi","there","be","some","sort","of","plot","relat","to","the","alien","but","the","alien","be","never","actual","show","in","the","movi","a","far","a","i","rememb","it","be","clearli","a","case","of","someon","make","a","buck","off","a","cheap","movi","design","to","scam","peopl","i","guess","my","world","of","innoc","end","that","dai","when","i","find","out","there","be","bad","peopl","out","there","who","make","bad","bad","movi"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","theater","kid","alwai","rememb","experi","get","rip","horribl","movi","good","commerci","commerci","great","find","late","everi","explos","special","effect","entir","movi","even","movi","sort","plot","relat","alien","alien","never","actual","show","movi","far","rememb","clearli","case","someon","make","buck","cheap","movi","design","scam","peopl","guess","world","innoc","end","dai","find","bad","peopl","make","bad","bad","movi"],"filtered2":["see","theater","kid","alwai","rememb","experi","get","rip","horribl","good","commerci","commerci","great","find","late","everi","explos","special","effect","entir","even","sort","plot","relat","alien","alien","never","actual","show","far","rememb","clearli","case","someon","make","buck","cheap","design","scam","peopl","guess","world","innoc","end","dai","find","bad","peopl","make","bad","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,9,23,24,28,32,38,42,51,52,85,101,106,114,132,139,150,165,197,198,203,230,243,269,288,290,333,351,424,494,565,681,824,903,1125,1155,1407,1616,4589],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,9,23,24,28,32,38,42,51,52,85,101,106,114,132,139,150,165,197,198,203,230,243,269,288,290,333,351,424,494,565,681,824,903,1125,1155,1407,1616,4589],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,3.205071257016622,2.729695454751562,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,3.038623282696244,1.6219954307453837,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,2.011190219103739,2.098582041218749,2.159084361316692,2.4433074195966826,2.253494045787767,2.2939035841256437,2.332712011146513,2.448847599972298,2.558331832813986,2.5439726117360975,2.569760528637609,2.7121382192999195,2.627841366673578,2.76533567167316,2.8015621426949333,5.7225627547931115,2.948928684455311,3.0135689919434205,3.212973749990824,3.3243163373261977,7.816221961917559,3.706716172503366,3.8767358583910254,3.948766986599908,8.481214138400706,4.235066888824737,4.443131333311827,4.688631791727313,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.824621377911763E-5,9.758371659151523E-5,9.83423369371447E-5,9.777411386664588E-5,9.777571578542023E-5,9.763904487407363E-5,9.792943707402535E-5,9.759776800907331E-5,9.781720337016397E-5,1.0852284750845678E-4,0.6929257763203824,9.744022369357564E-5,9.925889714849441E-5,1.0067484712707355E-4,9.751127608820636E-5,9.724179699325271E-5,9.9667371979742E-5,9.793861232307679E-5,9.763475815986966E-5,9.771568001521979E-5,9.866113653076565E-5,9.803564470476648E-5,0.2342532485567311,9.82530158376179E-5,9.900705725698974E-5,9.848927822015542E-5,1.0262958037440254E-4,9.746919177865387E-5,9.747179930779485E-5,9.77187435601366E-5,9.979573257830184E-5,9.793293761681624E-5,1.0512271246396123E-4,9.82084085187026E-5,9.757528261060027E-5,9.802565686213674E-5,9.747750973903596E-5,9.753511177541443E-5,9.724130844260228E-5,9.726653732431797E-5,9.74854724787407E-5,9.851373764764061E-5,9.801314794806408E-5,9.76256313595775E-5,9.881188514732238E-5,9.766310061036608E-5,1.0090796046761037E-4,9.942407949595096E-5,9.729071337620477E-5,9.750573180250164E-5,9.747191314116745E-5,1.0021513917799462E-4,9.750718250190446E-5,9.725790227845064E-5,0.06524216997455791,9.753229776364827E-5,1.0488526716802141E-4,9.745191847719137E-5,9.728958826491848E-5,9.775411749438985E-5,9.872375618350192E-5,9.774765050348297E-5,9.72715894735865E-5,9.7498071471821E-5,9.724248459344118E-5,9.949247413327897E-5,9.808018295058838E-5,9.787125780070113E-5,9.778566496241623E-5,9.814210925511801E-5,9.72389370333816E-5,9.778771499307495E-5,9.937376681441566E-5,9.741319460977095E-5,9.982412042086882E-5,9.767074519964532E-5,9.843516542673618E-5,9.783357299875661E-5,9.720844976270957E-5,9.732894631252335E-5]}}
{"value":"This, the direct-to-video death rattle of the Tremors series, features sixty inspired seconds (sawblade: you'll know it when you see it) and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at. Tremors 4 was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget. That means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm-on-human violence, tops. The lackluster, cliche-spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the Tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long.

{"value":"Terrible movie. If there is one Turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006, that should be Banyo. What a waste of time. Other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing, nada, zilch, nil. The dialog is cheap, and sexual clichés are all over it. The director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own. The red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do. If you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting. The only good thing I can say about the movie is, wait, wait, there is nothing good I can say about it. I must have really disliked it to write about it this much.

{"value":"This movie was advertised on radio, television, magazines, etc. Almost every hour or every issue. So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high. But oh boy, how sad this movie is! It is a movie in Hollywood style about a movie in a movie. Shades shows so clear we aren't ready to produce 'big Hollywood movies'. I am not a movie critic, but I think a good movie starts with a good script. And the script is a nightmare. Like my subject line says, it is nothing, and then looped. You could just stare to the television as well, without really seeing anything. That was the feeling we've got when we saw Shades.

{"value":"I've seen a lot of crap in my day, but goodness, Hot Rod takes the cake. I saw a free screening in NY the other night. I can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers. The big laughs were sparse, the plot was uninteresting, and the characters were one dimensional at best. One highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with Adam Samberg. It was priceless and was the only scene I truly had a hearty laugh at. Other than that, I can only recollect randomness and dead air. SNL & Samberg fans may be disappointed. I know I was expecting more from it. But it short, I definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film.","finished_norm":["i","have","see","a","lot","of","crap","in","my","dai","but","good","hot","rod","take","the","cake","i","see","a","free","screen","in","ny","the","other","night","i","can","onli","hope","thei","show","the","funni","version","to","the","pai","custom","the","big","laugh","be","spars","the","plot","be","uninterest","and","the","charact","be","on","dimension","at","well","on","highlight","be","a","hilari","danc","scene","with","adam","samberg","it","be","priceless","and","be","the","onli","scene","i","truli","have","a","hearti","laugh","at","other","than","that","i","can","onli","recollect","random","and","dead","air","snl","samberg","fan","mai","be","disappoint","i","know","i","be","expect","much","from","it","but","it","short","i","definit","would","not","recommend","attend","a","free","screen","or","pai","to","watch","thi","film"],"filtered":["see","lot","crap","dai","good","hot","rod","take","cake","see","free","screen","ny","night","onli","hope","thei","show","funni","version","pai","custom","big","laugh","spars","plot","uninterest","charact","dimension","well","highlight","hilari","danc","scene","adam","samberg","priceless","onli","scene","truli","hearti","laugh","onli","recollect","random","dead","air","snl","samberg","fan","mai","disappoint","know","expect","much","short","definit","recommend","attend","free","screen","pai","watch","thi","film"],"filtered2":["see","lot","crap","dai","good","hot","rod","take","cake","see","free","screen","ny","night","onli","hope","show","funni","version","pai","custom","big","laugh","spars","plot","uninterest","charact","dimension","well","highlight","hilari","danc","scene","adam","samberg","priceless","onli","scene","truli","hearti","laugh","onli","recollect","random","dead","air","snl","samberg","fan","mai","disappoint","know","expect","short","definit","recommend","attend","free","screen","pai","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,10,11,19,20,26,28,31,32,46,62,72,82,130,132,133,140,181,187,192,210,220,228,272,298,313,322,343,392,492,632,666,679,686,859,1248,1251,1385,1876,2604,2673,2901,3392,3591,4604,5117,5476,7389,8162],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,10,11,19,20,26,28,31,32,46,62,72,82,130,132,133,140,181,187,192,210,220,228,272,298,313,322,343,392,492,632,666,679,686,859,1248,1251,1385,1876,2604,2673,2901,3392,3591,4604,5117,5476,7389,8162],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,2.9739294460164585,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.655771293751733,2.0226120445069267,1.9209463754160525,2.020196584395323,2.2642139034199635,2.253494045787767,4.642472950759303,2.317169775997098,2.4442286541160034,2.4732161909892554,5.063653426867979,2.687151791517189,2.8336934208777267,2.7742700004069256,2.8028805344481915,2.7819920465008363,2.907069060519773,5.770689634656382,2.9705344631698933,3.0670934723591254,3.6016814428070463,3.541919708264792,3.6621227969605474,3.6715125373103863,7.2033628856140925,3.9405024767500145,4.327618446189983,4.637773374493822,4.403125998698128,4.890269137820559,5.214056214914456,5.521540914662417,5.463272006538442,5.604922523601468,6.1754673820690815,6.214688095222362,6.137727054086234,6.255510089742618,6.725513718988353,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.89318695739676E-5,0.051568672766926144,6.899931185736244E-5,6.860063309837631E-5,6.860175704251394E-5,6.850586549541901E-5,6.870961153796242E-5,6.847690466970188E-5,6.863086571419185E-5,0.0543724126157837,0.6424690246623037,6.836636784807514E-5,6.964239220127769E-5,7.06358562289716E-5,6.841621989031886E-5,6.822714697736143E-5,6.99289878135535E-5,6.871604910992163E-5,6.850285783524522E-5,6.855963452478991E-5,6.922298919985137E-5,6.878412932616409E-5,6.886245049239648E-5,6.893664205925063E-5,6.946569537106954E-5,6.910240934036873E-5,7.200734335375502E-5,6.838669254238762E-5,6.838852204656639E-5,6.85617839804332E-5,7.001904864844996E-5,6.871206760166013E-5,0.20254346604114576,6.890534450821802E-5,6.846112838178969E-5,6.877712161931212E-5,6.839252862032003E-5,6.843294357277574E-5,6.822680419865863E-5,6.824450537936603E-5,6.839811546701535E-5,6.911957065377114E-5,6.876834506904927E-5,6.849645425608254E-5,0.04387879946787164,6.852274356952317E-5,7.079941406766818E-5,6.975828804695775E-5,6.826146786973966E-5,6.841232988820705E-5,6.838860191475561E-5,7.031331424827737E-5,6.841334773325348E-5,6.823844682675015E-5,6.898746143741476E-5,6.843096919549866E-5,7.358998661171339E-5,6.837457318513482E-5,6.826067846502411E-5,6.858660317018585E-5,6.926692463073615E-5,6.858206577625909E-5,6.824805008690285E-5,6.840695521884259E-5,6.822762941393266E-5,6.98062753437553E-5,6.881537841387906E-5,

{"value":"Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn't go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it. Basically Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by Freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. This has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite poor, so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy. <br /><br /> I've not alot to say about this. It's moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four, but not worth watching a movie over. Uninspriring and unenjoyable, possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series.","finished_norm":["like","freddi","reveng","thi","sequel","take","a","pretti","weird","idea","and","doe","not","go","to","great","length","to","squeez","a","stori","out","of","it","basic","alic","from","numb","be","pregnant","and","her","babi","be","haunt","by","freddi","which","give","him","a","outlet","to","haunt","her","friend","thi","have","the","littl","death","out","of","the","whole","seri","and","the","wisecrack","be","quit","poor","so","neither","the","horror","fan","or","comedi","fan","be","happi","br","br","i","have","not","alot","to","sai","about","thi","it","moder","interest","to","see","the","charact","of","alic","and","dan","return","from","four","but","not","worth","watch","a","movi","over","uninsprir","and","unenjoy","possibli","onli","the","compet","direct","save","it","from","be","the","wrong","in","the","seri"],"filtered":["like","freddi","reveng","thi","sequel","take","pretti","weird","idea","doe","go","great","length","squeez","stori","basic","alic","numb","pregnant","babi","haunt","freddi","give","outlet","haunt","friend","thi","littl","death","whole","seri","wisecrack","quit","poor","neither","horror","fan","comedi","fan","happi","br","br","alot","sai","thi","moder","interest","see","charact","alic","dan","return","four","worth","watch","movi","uninsprir","unenjoy","possibli","onli","compet","direct","save","wrong","seri"],"filtered2":["like","freddi","reveng","sequel","take","pretti","weird","idea","doe","go","great","length","squeez","stori","basic","alic","numb","pregnant","babi","haunt","freddi","give","outlet","haunt","friend","littl","death","whole","wisecrack","quit","poor","neither","horror","fan","comedi","fan","happi","alot","moder","interest","see","charact","alic","dan","return","four","worth","watch","uninsprir","unenjoy","possibli","onli","compet","direct","save","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,10,11,14,17,18,25,30,31,51,60,78,83,102,111,120,123,127,140,146,161,189,219,245,286,387,488,516,558,605,606,625,698,718,871,1136,1262,1360,1650,1745,1812,1965,3995,4241,5138,5775,6998],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,10,11,14,17,18,25,30,31,51,60,78,83,102,111,120,123,127,140,146,161,189,219,245,286,387,488,516,558,605,606,625,698,718,871,1136,1262,1360,1650,1745,1812,1965,3995,4241,5138,5775,6998],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,2.0064197866819473,2.292318797740072,2.087553710177271,2.1183455303375887,2.2044500422972613,2.2619070973220485,2.4359679371086367,4.634339551994196,2.326138445979858,2.4323182980210873,2.498193474075453,2.5792094178355414,2.7502029743242886,2.780700890737216,3.360519385990158,3.3933092088131493,3.442099372982581,3.4572130107926293,3.5474598886404074,3.584239140143704,3.6194333882654965,3.90413483257914,3.634471265630037,3.9954846111673676,10.153710186801943,9.056578283304267,4.396611317676934,4.6295428753573065,5.089758498236879,4.869215728622727,10.712052952369687,5.7959777603641776,5.999576715605417,6.1754673820690815,6.342521466732247,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.324003166873278E-5,7.274615701306884E-5,7.331168901680961E-5,7.28880932966549E-5,7.288928748600074E-5,7.278740282815811E-5,7.300388276262799E-5,7.27566319843411E-5,7.292021541598003E-5,8.0900998446312E-5,0.6264192710382045,7.263918673925289E-5,7.399496113818088E-5,7.505051551817593E-5,7.269215447645844E-5,7.249126472519698E-5,7.429946864463516E-5,7.301072267538643E-5,7.27842071927033E-5,7.284453235965437E-5,7.354934593441125E-5,7.308305782637579E-5,7.316627397488077E-5,0.07367209339820903,7.38072209605215E-5,7.342122997322086E-5,7.650771900145896E-5,7.26607817034444E-5,7.266272554951762E-5,7.284681615378846E-5,7.439515817751301E-5,7.300649232746516E-5,7.836628500792244E-5,7.321184881706312E-5,7.273986969668744E-5,7.307561214595345E-5,7.26669825294953E-5,7.270992336971971E-5,7.249090052322183E-5,7.250970800724335E-5,7.267291854764513E-5,7.343946384885543E-5,7.306628707145354E-5,7.277740339725185E-5,7.366172516029628E-5,7.2805335762366E-5,7.522429553255598E-5,7.411810034012542E-5,7.252773063363986E-5,7.268802135371534E-5,7.266281040937626E-5,7.470781503686675E-5,7.268910281289953E-5,7.250327080209866E-5,7.329909795932605E-5,7.270782559614715E-5,7.818927563193447E-5,7.264790490038529E-5,7.252689189204292E-5,7.287318651418506E-5,7.35960272788934E-5,7.28683655383876E-5,7.251347425490002E-5,7.268231077373405E-5,7.249177731349574E-5,7.41690867874519E-5,7.311625994591802E-5,7.296051160707069E-5,0.2527714754058926,7.316242441710135E-5,7.248913269849107E-5,7.289823

{"value":"This would be a watchable Hollywood mediocre if it had a good editing. It relies on the typical American thriller plot - \"who is going to outsmart everyone\". Acting is below average, but with shining appearance of the detective who is the best actor in the film and he is mostly responsible if the tension in the film rises. Film was completely suffocated by blank video and sound shots and most of it looks like raw film material. All in all, if you don't mind watching a movie that looks like a student film project, this is a film to watch. I guess that would be enough to say on this film, everything else could really spoil the tension that is probably low enough.","finished_norm":["thi","would","be","a","watchabl","hollywood","mediocr","if","it","have","a","good","edit","it","reli","on","the","typic","american","thriller","plot","who","be","go","to","outsmart","everyon","act","be","below","averag","but","with","shine","appear","of","the","detect","who","be","the","well","actor","in","the","film","and","he","be","mostli","respons","if","the","tension","in","the","film","rise","film","be","complet","suffoc","by","blank","video","and","sound","shot","and","much","of","it","look","like","raw","film","materi","all","in","all","if","you","do","not","mind","watch","a","movi","that","look","like","a","student","film","project","thi","be","a","film","to","watch","i","guess","that","would","be","enough","to","sai","on","thi","film","everyth","els","can","realli","spoil","the","tension","that","be","probabl","low","enough"],"filtered":["thi","watchabl","hollywood","mediocr","good","edit","reli","typic","american","thriller","plot","go","outsmart","everyon","act","averag","shine","appear","detect","well","actor","film","mostli","respons","tension","film","rise","film","complet","suffoc","blank","video","sound","shot","much","look","like","raw","film","materi","mind","watch","movi","look","like","student","film","project","thi","film","watch","guess","enough","sai","thi","film","everyth","els","realli","spoil","tension","probabl","low","enough"],"filtered2":["watchabl","hollywood","mediocr","good","edit","reli","typic","american","thriller","plot","go","outsmart","everyon","act","averag","shine","appear","detect","well","actor","mostli","respons","tension","rise","complet","suffoc","blank","video","sound","shot","look","like","raw","materi","mind","watch","look","like","student","project","watch","guess","enough","everyth","els","realli","spoil","tension","probabl","low","enough"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,7,13,16,20,21,32,41,93,103,148,169,178,193,196,217,223,238,240,243,246,300,348,441,510,537,613,626,643,660,714,787,886,915,922,1063,1178,1193,1428,1707,2040,3186,7703],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,7,13,16,20,21,32,41,93,103,148,169,178,193,196,217,223,238,240,243,246,300,348,441,510,537,613,626,643,660,714,787,886,915,922,1063,1178,1193,1428,1707,2040,3186,7703],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.1317941569733974,2.393227744058217,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3711311285073675,1.5687599167621034,4.070779654240196,2.098582041218749,2.3018654096236517,2.4214486257841834,2.532833256045391,2.517840471459249,2.478925055209576,2.6113665294700725,2.825563294794476,2.597304642813496,2.7666071276613566,2.627841366673578,2.673149229007135,2.932274249550174,3.0103169565570433,3.293679367864308,3.374440724508766,3.424750734647968,3.5364100524538222,3.6528204042982337,3.5813614403160887,3.6405503117064195,3.7297814454343623,3.760240652919071,7.889252387867754,3.9363956947973615,4.030886538218284,4.327618446189983,4.229557233013768,4.240607069200353,4.449957298382227,4.706176101378222,5.089758498236879,5.604922523601468,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.669579387424863E-5,8.61111838683325E-5,8.6780616211663E-5,8.627919688668715E-5,8.628061047418861E-5,8.616000742290615E-5,8.64162593571161E-5,8.612358331614222E-5,8.631722052720673E-5,0.2645518212497493,0.5919657857601016,8.598456086451723E-5,8.75894200535613E-5,8.883890237717666E-5,8.604725990931732E-5,8.580946240882487E-5,8.79498721097828E-5,8.642435590832058E-5,8.615622468078582E-5,8.622763287273028E-5,8.706193579429745E-5,8.650998057555723E-5,8.660848531256263E-5,8.670179624155599E-5,8.736718798493126E-5,8.691028218751583E-5,9.056382534541012E-5,8.601012328607293E-5,8.6012424258296E-5,8.623033624875279E-5,8.806314185897983E-5,8.6419348354896E-5,0.07710341746848151,8.666243322920969E-5,8.6103741437293E-5,8.650116696419685E-5,8.601746333665607E-5,8.606829332878005E-5,8.580903129514774E-5,8.583129411673413E-5,8.6024489928456E-5,8.693186601657113E-5,8.649012867382089E-5,8.614817088241106E-5,8.719496149050609E-5,8.618123502115021E-5,8.904460950158509E-5,8.773518256384952E-5,8.585262788554258E-5,8.604236744341815E-5,8.60125247087279E-5,8.843324047874153E-5,8.604364758981324E-5,8.582367425915577E-5,8.676571190729035E-5,8.606581014927974E-5,9.255431993835303E-5,8.599488073854345E-5,8.585163504915317E-5,8.626155140905848E-5,0.05979345169675055,8.625584471676894E-5,8.583575230473708E-5,8.603560770760593E-5,8.581006917057085E-5,8.779553631339171E-5,8.65492826354613E-5,8.636491999151765E-5,8.62893899656813E-5,8.660392850858334E-5,8.580693868315712E-5,8.629119898232009E-5,8.76907849458665E-5,8.596070948350208E-5,8.808819225484806E-5,8.618798086621551E-5,8.686253122181672E-5,8.633166564312189E-5,8.578003568066674E-5,8.588

{"value":"Hey if you have a little over an hour to kill and find paint to be too exciting I'd suggest it. If thou you happen to like cheap b-movies like me it's good for a giggle! Other than that I wouldn't suggest that you rent it, I'd wait till it comes on the tube say round 4 am on the free access channel of your cable/satellite supplier. The band that did this sound track by the way was on the road after for about two years after this flick, and no they sounded just as bad live according to the two small town reviews I could find on them. So once again good if you find grass growing to much fun but good to watch if you like to see how NOT to shoot a low budget movie.","finished_norm":["hei","if","you","have","a","littl","over","a","hour","to","kill","and","find","paint","to","be","too","excit","i","have","suggest","it","if","thou","you","happen","to","like","cheap","bmovi","like","me","it","good","for","a","giggl","other","than","that","i","would","not","suggest","that","you","rend","it","i","have","wait","till","it","come","on","the","tube","sai","round","be","on","the","free","access","channel","of","your","cablesatellit","supplier","the","band","that","do","thi","sound","track","by","the","wai","be","on","the","road","after","for","about","two","year","after","thi","flick","and","no","thei","sound","just","a","bad","live","accord","to","the","two","small","town","review","i","can","find","on","them","so","onc","again","good","if","you","find","grass","grow","to","much","fun","but","good","to","watch","if","you","like","to","see","how","not","to","shoot","a","low","budget","movi"],"filtered":["hei","littl","hour","kill","find","paint","excit","suggest","thou","happen","like","cheap","bmovi","like","good","giggl","suggest","rend","wait","till","come","tube","sai","round","free","access","channel","cablesatellit","supplier","band","thi","sound","track","wai","road","two","year","thi","flick","thei","sound","bad","live","accord","two","small","town","review","find","onc","good","find","grass","grow","much","fun","good","watch","like","see","shoot","low","budget","movi"],"filtered2":["hei","littl","hour","kill","find","paint","excit","suggest","thou","happen","like","cheap","bmovi","like","good","giggl","suggest","rend","wait","till","come","tube","round","free","access","channel","cablesatellit","supplier","band","sound","track","wai","road","two","year","flick","sound","bad","live","accord","two","small","town","review","find","onc","good","find","grass","grow","fun","good","watch","like","see","shoot","low","budget"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,9,14,33,34,38,47,57,76,94,116,117,174,176,178,217,236,256,257,259,331,351,363,450,524,531,561,646,686,728,867,868,927,974,1080,1287,1379,1480,1925,2744,2873,3458,4675],"values":[3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,9,14,33,34,38,47,57,76,94,116,117,174,176,178,217,236,256,257,259,331,351,363,450,524,531,561,646,686,728,867,868,927,974,1080,1287,1379,1480,1925,2744,2873,3458,4675],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1175081997259209,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,4.557934924044366,3.412938870621443,1.834162586674748,2.1337665533324026,2.08112281984698,2.2466628996789315,2.2797301185117202,2.456282578459816,2.5040471493269134,5.065666512090782,2.6113665294700725,2.617923930016232,2.748952192422636,2.7602659523229094,2.7464553122240485,2.932274249550174,3.0135689919434205,3.0349689855553557,3.469984576472117,3.4028786598293,3.424750734647968,3.4725585804672896,7.180039006118407,3.6016814428070463,3.7740817043309423,3.8844878351953436,3.944626193933877,4.251780369798478,4.030886538218284,4.229557233013768,4.499089986959872,4.403125998698128,4.5432147918688095,4.890269137820559,5.3064295350454715,5.426230734858092,5.649374286172302,6.101359409915359]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.126308565188166E-5,8.071510966757246E-5,8.134259267941399E-5,8.087259431234068E-5,8.087391931874611E-5,8.076087374123562E-5,8.100106789538766E-5,8.072673211595626E-5,8.090823523813716E-5,8.976327039017443E-5,0.9935687794258422,8.059642137204264E-5,8.210071360942229E-5,8.327189832954545E-5,8.065519144173335E-5,8.043229529202681E-5,8.243857828554038E-5,8.100865708402775E-5,8.07573280409982E-5,8.082426150753576E-5,8.160628364200365E-5,8.108891616415864E-5,8.118124819692136E-5,8.126871188663671E-5,8.18924074988182E-5,8.146413326207648E-5,8.488873066530757E-5,8.062038194913089E-5,8.062253873315108E-5,8.082679547910979E-5,8.254475009526066E-5,8.100396332410395E-5,8.69508926432822E-5,8.123181551945594E-5,8.070813360928873E-5,8.108065484924504E-5,8.06272620425307E-5,8.067490682227224E-5,8.043189119367204E-5,8.045275893703744E-5,8.063384831973935E-5,8.14843645613222E-5,8.107030826267852E-5,8.074977892612303E-5,8.17309734113895E-5,8.078077113252999E-5,8.346471501560349E-5,8.223734205273022E-5,8.047275584582027E-5,8.065060555748631E-5,8.062263288895365E-5,8.289165684232804E-5,8.065180548474346E-5,8.044561657047761E-5,8.132862233888544E-5,8.067257924881793E-5,8.675449283631381E-5,8.060609456112637E-5,8.047182522456468E-5,8.085605457153171E-5,8.165807867825042E-5,8.085070548360495E-5,8.045693775699336E-5,8.064426941399255E-5,8.043286403163379E-5,8.22939137928261E-5,8.112575539842314E-5,8.095294566156866E-5,8.08821486518806E-5,8.117697694066405E-5,8.04299297131915E-5,8.088384430823825E-5,8.219572656861426E-5,8.05740646147914E-5,8.25682307322568E-5,8.07

{"value":"I would have rated this film a minus 10 but sadly it is not offered.<br /><br />Why I didn't walk out in the first five minutes of this movie I cannot say. I should have gone with my instinct and left immediately!! Several people in our theater did and sadly I didn't follow them out.<br /><br />The story lacked all criteria for a movie. NO plot. Awful acting! Even Robin Williams was so disappointing that I may never see another film he is in. Not a single relationship in the story went beyond parlor talk. I did like the tazer scene. Too bad it didn't shock some meat into the senselessness of the plot.

{"value":"I have a nice collection on movies going, and this one was added to it. Number 274 to be exact. <br /><br />The title had me going at first. Splatter University. I thought this would be a great horror movie. Was I ever wrong. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it could have been a lot better. I love all movies, but this one was one that was more of a laugh then a scare. <br /><br />Poor audio quality, poor acting, and poor shot arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved. 3 out of 10 stars.<br /><br />Movie is ideal for a good laugh. If your looking for one of those movies to make fun of, then this is one!","finished_norm":["i","have","a","nice","collect","on","movi","go","and","thi","on","be","add","to","it","numb","to","be","exact","br","br","the","titl","have","me","go","at","splatter","univers","i","think","thi","would","be","a","great","horror","movi","be","i","ever","wrong","do","not","get","me","wrong","thi","be","not","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","but","it","can","have","be","a","lot","well","i","love","all","movi","but","thi","on","be","on","that","be","much","of","a","laugh","then","a","scare","br","br","poor","audio","qualiti","poor","act","and","poor","shoot","arrang","be","some","of","the","area","that","can","have","be","improv","out","of","starsbr","br","movi","be","ideal","for","a","good","laugh","if","your","look","for","on","of","that","movi","to","make","fun","of","then","thi","be","on"],"filtered":["nice","collect","movi","go","thi","add","numb","exact","br","br","titl","go","splatter","univers","think","thi","great","horror","movi","ever","wrong","get","wrong","thi","wrong","movi","ever","see","lot","well","love","movi","thi","much","laugh","scare","br","br","poor","audio","qualiti","poor","act","poor","shoot","arrang","area","improv","starsbr","br","movi","ideal","good","laugh","look","movi","make","fun","thi"],"filtered2":["nice","collect","go","add","numb","exact","titl","go","splatter","univers","think","great","horror","ever","wrong","get","wrong","wrong","ever","see","lot","well","love","laugh","scare","poor","audio","qualiti","poor","act","poor","shoot","arrang","area","improv","starsbr","ideal","good","laugh","look","make","fun"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,12,16,20,21,25,44,51,54,72,83,117,133,146,259,262,264,299,319,516,623,913,1026,1116,1156,1723,2394,2763,3040,3673,5705],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,12,16,20,21,25,44,51,54,72,83,117,133,146,259,262,264,299,319,516,623,913,1026,1116,1156,1723,2394,2763,3040,3673,5705],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,3.838916364248105,3.209458785004948,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.9209463754160525,2.292318797740072,2.2797301185117202,4.642472950759303,6.978415337939575,2.7464553122240485,2.726701583487816,2.757740698455715,2.7949961309240425,2.9056060024680126,3.442099372982581,3.607563812710113,4.067587905068712,4.062925891962901,4.181290492043933,4.2860694432771105,4.760735085628657,5.290429193699031,5.373120909544144,5.463272006538442,5.719991853386255,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1292612179653657E-4,1.1216463455729037E-4,1.130366076364819E-4,1.1238348091333899E-4,1.1238532219014409E-4,1.122282299686009E-4,1.1256201244915774E-4,1.1218078553176096E-4,1.1243300883238304E-4,1.247382858234053E-4,0.8854100421780007,1.1199970101078146E-4,1.1409011988982367E-4,1.1571764051976185E-4,1.1208137002438887E-4,1.1177162547619922E-4,1.1455962885887148E-4,1.1257255866007052E-4,1.122233027353602E-4,1.1231631590036435E-4,1.1340304213154411E-4,1.126840895794964E-4,1.1281239751038339E-4,1.1293394021576233E-4,1.1380065018745711E-4,1.1320550482431158E-4,1.1796444918827597E-4,1.1203299749497076E-4,1.1203599464002131E-4,1.123198371988765E-4,0.07654417493184142,1.1256603604158285E-4,1.2083010402799662E-4,1.1288266768998163E-4,1.1215494037448784E-4,1.12672609357614E-4,1.1204255832150113E-4,1.1210876722997294E-4,1.1177106392651572E-4,1.1180006249714584E-4,1.1205171085042964E-4,1.1323361896918312E-4,1.1265823136685206E-4,1.1221281221239997E-4,1.1357631554309987E-4,1.1225588010291115E-4,1.1598558555777669E-4,1.1427998371429077E-4,1.1182785092455604E-4,1.1207499731384174E-4,1.1203612548232865E-4,1.1518924320192489E-4,1.1207666477614029E-4,1.1179013720635016E-4,1.1301719394620159E-4,1.1210553274975005E-4,1.2055717975562112E-4,1.1201314322405538E-4,1.118265576996137E-4,1.1236049669153529E-4,0.029336908454253203,1.1235306340556206E-4,1.118058695364371E-4,1.1206619237976673E-4,1.117724158173192E-4,1.1435859784961509E-4,1.1273528271131108E-4,1.1249514005323808E-4,1.1239675796898998E-4,1.128064620182658E-4,1.1176833818232484E-4,1.1239911431436909E-4,1.142221533330026E-4,1.1196863325262194E-4,1.1473979858626576E-4,1.1226466694351115E-4,1.1314330652001713E-4,1.1245182440400773E-4,1.1173329551646808E-4,1.118717966101685E-4]}}
{"value":"because that is the only way you won't think this film is a TOTAL waste of time and money. A remake of \"Heaven Can Wait\", (which was at least worth watching) is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy. It is more a vehicle to give Rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which doesn't play well on the big screen. Especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man but are shown coming from Rock himself. As he insults Blacks and Whites the chemistry is all wrong. The movie is not funny, poorly shot the acting is weak at best. Go rent \"Heaven Can Wait\" and a live Rock video and you'll be way ahead of the game.","finished_norm":["becaus","that","be","the","onli","wai","you","wo","not","think","thi","film","be","a","total","wast","of","time","and","monei","a","remak","of","heaven","can","wait","which","be","at","littl","worth","watch","be","a","poor","excus","for","a","romant","comedi","it","be","much","a","vehicl","to","give","rock","some","time","on","film","for","weak","stand","up","comedi","which","doe","not","plai","good","on","the","big","screen","especi","becaus","hi","joke","gener","be","suppos","to","be","from","the","bodi","of","a","old","fat","rich","dead","man","but","be","show","come","from","rock","himself","a","he","insult","black","and","white","the","chemistri","be","all","wrong","the","movi","be","not","funni","poorli","shoot","the","act","be","weak","at","well","go","rend","heaven","can","wait","and","a","live","rock","video","and","you","will","be","wai","ahead","of","the","game"],"filtered":["becaus","onli","wai","wo","think","thi","film","total","wast","time","monei","remak","heaven","wait","littl","worth","watch","poor","excus","romant","comedi","much","vehicl","give","rock","time","film","weak","stand","comedi","doe","plai","good","big","screen","especi","becaus","hi","joke","gener","suppos","bodi","old","fat","rich","dead","man","show","come","rock","insult","black","white","chemistri","wrong","movi","funni","poorli","shoot","act","weak","well","go","rend","heaven","wait","live","rock","video","wai","ahead","game"],"filtered2":["becaus","onli","wai","wo","think","total","wast","time","monei","remak","heaven","wait","littl","worth","watch","poor","excus","romant","comedi","vehicl","give","rock","time","weak","stand","comedi","doe","plai","good","big","screen","especi","becaus","joke","gener","suppos","bodi","old","fat","rich","dead","man","show","come","rock","insult","black","white","chemistri","wrong","funni","poorli","shoot","act","weak","well","go","rend","heaven","wait","live","rock","video","wai","ahead","game"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,7,8,11,12,14,18,20,21,22,25,28,30,33,34,40,45,62,67,82,89,116,117,126,127,146,149,184,192,214,219,225,228,229,240,267,331,359,374,376,377,379,398,406,483,531,582,617,709,864,937,1132,1151,1322,1424,1543],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,7,8,11,12,14,18,20,21,22,25,28,30,33,34,40,45,62,67,82,89,116,117,126,127,146,149,184,192,214,219,225,228,229,240,267,331,359,374,376,377,379,398,406,483,531,582,617,709,864,937,1132,1151,1322,1424,1543],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,2.5958480334723544,1.2796387880827016,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,2.803707089537043,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,1.8162961064622165,2.0226120445069267,1.9570915389266579,2.020196584395323,1.9940046109572438,2.2466628996789315,2.2797301185117202,2.2391270689902285,4.871935874217273,2.326138445979858,2.3253197803590226,2.496249838866882,2.5318267134339894,2.7303758068497004,2.5792094178355414,2.641219492619754,2.7742700004069256,2.8432628718938773,2.7666071276613566,2.7085302779237206,5.864548499100348,3.2189558216683714,3.4572130107926293,3.1569204307489187,3.0602441305135506,6.254577266285095,3.143848349181566,3.121829110937649,3.613480989738201,3.424750734647968,11.129936454414548,3.5119855004467477,3.6497387377608255,3.9782428047328615,4.030886538218284,4.218628162481577,4.3336974922663645,4.3521595551061,4.470719289830655,9.412352202756445]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.429080155265802E-5,7.378984131001685E-5,7.436348696396211E-5,7.393381394406358E-5,7.393502526636488E-5,7.383167887608364E-5,7.405126463383665E-5,7.380046656500822E-5,7.396639691730733E-5,8.206167971323668E-5,0.9941205711353016,7.368133634076671E-5,7.505656194520803E-5,7.612726029398725E-5,7.373506400259008E-5,7.353129209937149E-5,7.536543820069095E-5,7.405820267837045E-5,7.382843739305859E-5,7.388962804118478E-5,7.460455352962142E-5,7.413157561698057E-5,7.421598566205704E-5,7.429594506260874E-5,7.486612827165313E-5,7.44745994972205E-5,7.760537017913957E-5,7.370324112647932E-5,7.370521286078342E-5,7.389194460076207E-5,7.546250058495981E-5,7.405391163792772E-5,7.949060090901158E-5,7.426221436348192E-5,7.37834637899237E-5,7.41240231138743E-5,7.37095309153709E-5,7.37530878249862E-5,7.353092267221472E-5,7.354999998596393E-5,7.371555209718001E-5,7.449309497306121E-5,7.411456425314811E-5,7.38215359840044E-5,7.471854505281774E-5,7.384986909291096E-5,7.630353351872478E-5,7.518146781712778E-5,7.35682811817878E-5,7.373087158220871E-5,7.370529893812083E-5,7.577964311156856E-5,7.37319685570162E-5,7.354347042666336E-5,7.435071526341069E-5,7.375095995479513E-5,

{"value":"I can't believe that in the 34 prior comments, nobody mentioned that this film is a blatant rip-off of Born Yesterday. A man is hired to bring an ostensibly dumb blonde up to the requirements of a gangster. Hired gun and blonde fall in love and live happily ever after. Gangster is left in the lurch. But Born Yesterday was an intelligent treatment whereas this is just so much fluff. Technicolor transfer to DVD is deplorable. Natalie Kalmus would be rolling over in her grave. Check out the paperboy. Recognize him? But, it's historically interesting to see the roots of Rock 'n Roll. Also interesting is Ewell's introduction to CinemaScope, a new format at the time.","finished_norm":["i","ca","not","believ","that","in","the","prior","comment","nobodi","mention","that","thi","film","be","a","blatant","ripoff","of","bear","yesterdai","a","man","be","hire","to","bring","a","ostensibli","dumb","blond","up","to","the","requir","of","a","gangster","hire","gun","and","blond","fall","in","love","and","live","happili","ever","after","gangster","be","leav","in","the","lurch","but","bear","yesterdai","be","a","intellig","treatment","wherea","thi","be","just","so","much","fluff","technicolor","transfer","to","dvd","be","deplor","natali","kalmu","would","be","roll","over","in","her","grave","check","out","the","paperboi","recogn","him","but","it","histor","interest","to","see","the","root","of","rock","n","roll","conjur","interest","be","ewel","introduct","to","cinemascop","a","new","format","at","the","time"],"filtered":["ca","believ","prior","comment","nobodi","mention","thi","film","blatant","ripoff","bear","yesterdai","man","hire","bring","ostensibli","dumb","blond","requir","gangster","hire","gun","blond","fall","love","live","happili","ever","gangster","leav","lurch","bear","yesterdai","intellig","treatment","wherea","thi","much","fluff","technicolor","transfer","dvd","deplor","natali","kalmu","roll","grave","check","paperboi","recogn","histor","interest","see","root","rock","n","roll","conjur","interest","ewel","introduct","cinemascop","new","format","time"],"filtered2":["ca","believ","prior","comment","nobodi","mention","blatant","ripoff","bear","yesterdai","man","hire","bring","ostensibli","dumb","blond","requir","gangster","hire","gun","blond","fall","love","live","happili","ever","gangster","leav","lurch","bear","yesterdai","intellig","treatment","wherea","fluff","technicolor","transfer","dvd","deplor","natali","kalmu","roll","grave","check","paperboi","recogn","histor","interest","see","root","rock","n","roll","conjur","interest","ewel","introduct","cinemascop","new","format","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,39,44,45,54,60,74,81,87,91,116,170,247,250,280,285,420,501,504,525,582,603,795,866,953,985,989,1014,1362,1413,1444,1568,1705,1816,2074,2190,2280,2289,2415,2453,2460,2756,3130,3908,5048,5645,6464,7623,7969],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,39,44,45,54,60,74,81,87,91,116,170,247,250,280,285,420,501,504,525,582,603,795,866,953,985,989,1014,1362,1413,1444,1568,1705,1816,2074,2190,2280,2289,2415,2453,2460,2756,3130,3908,5048,5645,6464,7623,7969],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9418936859054116,1.5538940054862738,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,1.8113893252729412,3.676353282473182,1.9486336368009016,1.949757232424728,2.115024371522662,2.0105926690411424,2.2466628996789315,2.4071371113909277,2.7303758068497004,2.6812935439488212,2.8028805344481915,2.808171552082607,3.3023374306074227,3.5119855004467477,3.41740676039221,6.829941411188657,3.7099788181381825,3.530930586689197,7.569179363858714,3.8962296530720266,4.1302590120314875,8.341747462371355,4.044492190274062,8.260518024062975,4.396611317676934,4.484804029712395,4.573751515728891,4.597282013139085,10.0054942424945,4.789173020949191,4.933754249760298,5.064116067623542,5.129498826886393,5.089758498236879,5.243909178064138,5.116075806554253,5.129498826886393,5.322690055917252,10.926544013076883,5.850044981634453,6.342521466732247,6.2980697041614135,6.489124940924123,6.794506590475304,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.5990775938082536E-5,5.561321704635718E-5,5.604555677895703E-5,5.57217249548149E-5,5.572263789254263E-5,5.5644748780279586E-5,5.581024405970296E-5,5.562122498622421E-5,5.5746281776334644E-5,6.184745656122397E-5,0.49315034361232724,5.55314400659709E-5,5.65679068569236E-5,5.737486047824481E-5,5.5571933012768594E-5,5.541835616695273E-5,5.68006977388618E-5,5.581547305829796E-5,5.564230577056682E-5,5.568842334901711E-5,5.622724150683583E-5,5.587077206813197E-5,5.5934389418086804E-5,5.5994652449133254E-5,5.642438263960149E-5,5.6129299003075755E-5,5.84888681031695E-5,5.554794905393675E-5,0.05997564988125629,5.569016927133223E-5,5.687385078198467E-5,5.581223902825724E-5,0.13215273182280327,5.5969230620621875E-5,5.5608410498425094E-5,5.5865079970316943E-5,5.5552689481461656E-5,5.5585517033673434E-5,5.541807774065059E-5,5.543245574677394E-5,5.555722746778714E-5,5.614323849520699E-5,5.5857951107248024E-5,5.56371043830473E-5,5.6313153540368036E-5,5.565845820773706E-5,5.7507712384858945E-5,5.6662044711703016E-5,5.544623374240545E-5,5.5568773309746066E-5,5.554949996559923E-5,5.7112871707545703E-5,5.5569600067155764E-5,5.542753461139604E-5,5.603593112666929E-5,5.5583913320957945E-5,0.20076173172177542,5.553810495394862E-5,5.5445592538520706E-5,5.5710328969611047E-5,5.626292861182249E-5,5.570664341446411E-5,5.543533497994557E-5,5.5564407667

{"value":"I saw this film under the title of \"Tied Up\". In general I have enjoyed Dolph's movies, so gave this one a try. It wasn't worth it. I have read some of the previous comments about the box enticing viewers. Don't be fooled. This is a poor film at best. The acting is nonexistent. The plot, what little there is of one, is very predictable. The movie in places seems to be chopped together. This one just plain stinks the place up. Not even worth the price of a cheap night rental. As a bit of a Dolph fan, I kept waiting to see him in action. By the end of the movie, you will still be waiting. Best to avoid this film, and spend your time watching almost anything else.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","film","under","the","titl","of","tie","up","in","gener","i","have","enjoi","dolph","movi","so","give","thi","on","a","try","it","be","not","worth","it","i","have","read","some","of","the","previou","comment","about","the","box","entic","viewer","do","not","be","fool","thi","be","a","poor","film","at","well","the","act","be","nonexist","the","plot","what","littl","there","be","of","on","be","veri","predict","the","movi","in","place","seem","to","be","chop","togeth","thi","on","just","plain","stink","the","place","up","not","even","worth","the","price","of","a","cheap","night","rental","a","a","bite","of","a","dolph","fan","i","keep","wait","to","see","him","in","action","by","the","end","of","the","movi","you","will","still","be","wait","well","to","avoid","thi","film","and","spend","your","time","watch","almost","anyth","els"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","titl","tie","gener","enjoi","dolph","movi","give","thi","try","worth","read","previou","comment","box","entic","viewer","fool","thi","poor","film","well","act","nonexist","plot","littl","veri","predict","movi","place","seem","chop","togeth","thi","plain","stink","place","even","worth","price","cheap","night","rental","bite","dolph","fan","keep","wait","see","action","end","movi","still","wait","well","avoid","thi","film","spend","time","watch","almost","anyth","els"],"filtered2":["see","titl","tie","gener","enjoi","dolph","give","try","worth","read","previou","comment","box","entic","viewer","fool","poor","well","act","nonexist","plot","littl","veri","predict","place","seem","chop","togeth","plain","stink","place","even","worth","price","cheap","night","rental","bite","dolph","fan","keep","wait","see","action","end","still","wait","well","avoid","spend","time","watch","almost","anyth","els"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,8,14,15,20,21,24,30,32,35,36,64,104,129,131,134,140,145,146,154,164,196,200,210,219,225,264,270,279,280,283,331,335,337,351,586,654,784,1057,1175,1408,1484,1504,1653,1863,2806,5629],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,8,14,15,20,21,24,30,32,35,36,64,104,129,131,134,140,145,146,154,164,196,200,210,219,225,264,270,279,280,283,331,335,337,351,586,654,784,1057,1175,1408,1484,1504,1653,1863,2806,5629],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.883428577602134,2.0728240170322856,2.4106958340079214,2.2512118082053005,2.2443961816702407,2.317169775997098,2.34599021453259,2.326138445979858,2.348499626138016,4.7860550597492155,2.478925055209576,2.5308211829319704,2.687151791517189,5.158418835671083,2.641219492619754,2.757740698455715,2.731603554088023,2.7910771187233068,2.8028805344481915,2.7678802023081546,5.864548499100348,2.908534262247101,2.973659465713028,3.0135689919434205,3.4572130107926293,3.634471265630037,3.7636829971100436,4.181290492043933,4.263079925052412,4.477736862489302,4.484804029712395,4.535724120139652,4.706176101378222,4.8184434032493035,11.756431717202299,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.386526029436236E-5,0.10964780129477276,8.394731326473311E-5,8.34622647943688E-5,8.346363222960944E-5,8.33469667509731E-5,8.359485230808125E-5,8.331173185596563E-5,8.349904699990625E-5,9.263763461301564E-5,0.8837983398465843,8.317724835254215E-5,8.472971044568826E-5,8.593839838336608E-5,8.323790033434411E-5,8.300786669159235E-5,8.507839409189261E-5,8.36026845147421E-5,8.334330751171395E-5,8.34123842954534E-5,8.421944803585893E-5,8.368551361964464E-5,8.378080227253095E-5,8.38710666901991E-5,8.451473403854623E-5,8.407274577224315E-5,8.760700428976626E-5,8.320197618582818E-5,8.320420203353999E-5,8.34149994088709E-5,8.518796569364374E-5,8.359784045307979E-5,8.973520000944201E-5,8.383298884202597E-5,8.329253779521533E-5,8.367698776414648E-5,8.320907659087922E-5,8.325824703306263E-5,8.300744965335864E-5,8.302898561541392E-5,8.32158737712723E-5,8.40936249102149E-5,8.366630986324474E-5,8.333551666204438E-5,8.43481305721139E-5,8.336750128872409E-5,8.613738936968707E-5,8.487071395139711E-5,8.304962285736335E-5,8.323316760271114E-5,8.320429920436271E-5,8.554598095244534E-5,8.32344059535681E-5,8.302161453879467E-5,8.393289557144187E-5,8.325584492696447E-5,8.953251116491885E-5,8.318723129269111E-5,8.304866243611907E-5,8.344519542446957E-5,8.42729016324329E-5,8.343967505014812E-5,8.303329824790278E-5,8.322662856571661E-5,8.300845364315587E-5,8.492909720955654E-5,8.372353250541366E-5,8.354518912297325E-5,8.347212507922052E-5,8.377639424378174E-5,8.300542536311979E-5,8.347387503322069E-5,8.482776587257801E-5,8.315417569598262E-5,8.521219821

{"value":"I've read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film. I can't say that I found much to recommend it. The Leonard Cohen sound track is not only excessively heavy-handed but dreary beyond measure. The film looks authentic enough, but something's got to happen for it to work, and nothing much does: a cursory plot (not a real problem for me), not much character development, nothing thematically. It just slogs along. Flawed as it is, Cimino's \"Heaven's Gate\" has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film I'd sooner watch again. For a brilliant reconception of the West, HBO's \"Deadwood\" is much superior to

{"value":"This has got to be the cheesiest, stupidest, most retarded monster film of all time. It's a complete joke that this even surfaced into theaters. This is sort of like watching the Loch Ness monster in rural America. This movie deserves to be thrown in a toilet and completely forgotten. John Carradine, shame on you. The people involved in this moronic pile of trash need to be lobotomized. Wait! Maybe I'm giving them too much credit. I'm sure they were lobotomized before the filming. How else can one explain the utter and sheer stupidity that this bucket of crap contains. Don't waste a minute of your life watching this.

{"value":"A disappointing film.<br /><br />The story established our protagonist as Chrissy, a 'young', rather sullen individual drifting, not doing much. Actually she does very little to move the narrative along so it didn't surprise me to see the focus shifting on her relatives. It's a pity though, Chrissy seem like interesting character.<br /><br />Story was predictable and at times felt quite formulated. So the question now is, when are we going to see the Campions, Jacksons, and the Tamahori's breaking ground with compelling, cinematically-told stories that will inspire, rather than entertain for the toll of two hours?<br /><br />Technically, a disgusting shot
