{"value":"At least among those movies with 100 votes or more. Nominated for best screenplay written directly for the screen? Brenda Blethyn nominated for best actress in a leading role?? Nominated for best picture?? I always disagree with many of the Oscar picks, but this movie might very well be the worst movie of all time to be honored by the Academy. The writing and acting were both horrible. Blethyn's perfomance in particular was one of the worst I've ever seen, and probably the most over-rated acting performance of all time. Awful movie, not worthy of the big screen and not worthy of any cable or television channel that has ever played it, including HBO(where I saw it). I am only thankful I didn't actually pay to see one of the most over-rated movies of all time.","finished_norm":["at","littl","among","that","movi","with","vote","or","much","nomin","for","well","screenplai","write","directli","for","the","screen","brenda","blethyn","nomin","for","well","actress","in","a","lead","role","nomin","for","well","pictur","i","alwai","disagre","with","mani","of","the","oscar","pick","but","thi","movi","mai","veri","good","be","the","wrong","movi","of","all","time","to","be","honor","by","the","academi","the","write","and","act","be","both","horribl","blethyn","perfom","in","particular","be","on","of","the","wrong","i","have","ever","see","and","probabl","the","much","overr","act","perform","of","all","time","aw","movi","not","worthi","of","the","big","screen","and","not","worthi","of","ani","cabl","or","televis","channel","that","have","ever","plai","it","includ","hbowher","i","see","it","i","be","onli","thank","i","do","not","actual","pai","to","see","on","of","the","much","overr","movi","of","all","time"],"filtered":["littl","among","movi","vote","much","nomin","well","screenplai","write","directli","screen","brenda","blethyn","nomin","well","actress","lead","role","nomin","well","pictur","alwai","disagre","mani","oscar","pick","thi","movi","mai","veri","good","wrong","movi","time","honor","academi","write","act","horribl","blethyn","perfom","particular","wrong","ever","see","probabl","much","overr","act","perform","time","aw","movi","worthi","big","screen","worthi","ani","cabl","televis","channel","ever","plai","includ","hbowher","see","onli","thank","actual","pai","see","much","overr","movi","time"],"filtered2":["littl","among","vote","nomin","well","screenplai","write","directli","screen","brenda","blethyn","nomin","well","actress","lead","role","nomin","well","pictur","alwai","disagre","mani","oscar","pick","mai","veri","good","wrong","time","honor","academi","write","act","horribl","blethyn","perfom","particular","wrong","ever","see","probabl","overr","act","perform","time","aw","worthi","big","screen","worthi","ani","cabl","televis","channel","ever","plai","includ","hbowher","see","onli","thank","actual","pai","see","overr","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,11,14,15,20,21,25,27,40,44,46,50,52,65,82,105,128,138,148,157,192,197,230,301,311,322,354,446,651,663,703,728,826,832,979,1190,1337,1535,1795,1868,1995,2048,2111,3350,3978],"values":[3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,11,14,15,20,21,25,27,40,44,46,50,52,65,82,105,128,138,148,157,192,197,230,301,311,322,354,446,651,663,703,728,826,832,979,1190,1337,1535,1795,1868,1995,2048,2111,3350,3978],"values":[1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,2.825681057716235,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,3.4960351200691706,2.324031090670098,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.6284968758320737,3.209458785004948,1.655771293751733,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,3.8147700134888347,2.020196584395323,2.1765612129984904,2.3409902041158843,2.2907365189289424,2.3018654096236517,2.3360150694757706,5.063653426867979,2.558331832813986,2.7121382192999195,2.8309760279012264,2.9203338091782562,2.885344817328191,3.0316467233633775,3.233054746047873,3.5474598886404074,3.7297814454343623,3.6746621462132825,3.7740817043309423,3.8204358137024927,3.7987743169213135,4.096025840389245,4.291900363587903,8.793222635353867,4.558366596889411,14.639061085470068,4.933754249760298,4.890269137820559,5.02684467282631,9.981825327200493,5.541743621979936,5.999576715605417]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.401373523166218E-5,7.35146433119963E-5,7.408614956392176E-5,7.365807900247525E-5,7.365928580716996E-5,7.35563248455494E-5,7.377509166183495E-5,7.352522894027415E-5,7.369054045805684E-5,8.175563203010904E-5,0.7945301723294602,7.340654301024215E-5,7.477663973343843E-5,7.584334493035778E-5,7.346007029563553E-5,7.325705835637435E-5,7.508436404001301E-5,7.37820038310459E-5,7.355309545158192E-5,7.361405789019359E-5,7.432631707579424E-5,7.385510312648975E-5,7.393919836569315E-5,7.401885955897724E-5,7.458691627913307E-5,7.419684770481711E-5,7.73159422290344E-5,7.342836610241717E-5,7.343033048317065E-5,7.361636581020009E-5,7.518106443171814E-5,7.377772879396784E-5,7.919414202194467E-5,7.398525465793735E-5,7.350828957675932E-5,7.384757879031945E-5,7.343463243364467E-5,7.347802689848283E-5,7.325669030699008E-5,7.327569647221182E-5,7.344063115955537E-5,7.421527420208528E-5,7.383815520625858E-5,7.354621978121913E-5,7.443988346948198E-5,7.357444722226262E-5,7.601896074700646E-5,7.490107977096577E-5,7.32939094886169E-5,7.345589351081692E-5,7.343041623948405E-5,7.549702418049647E-5,7.345698639447494E-5,7.326919126479512E-5,7.407342549521723E-5,7.347590696414858E-5,7.901526272889421E-5,7.341535326953694E-5,7.329306188660105E-5,7.36430147455963E-5,7.43734915593661E-5,7.363814284128248E-5,7.327950250629627E-5

{"value":"The animation in this re-imagining of Peter & the Wolf is excellent, but at 29 minutes, the film is sleep inducing. They should have called it \"Peter & the Snails\", because everything moves at a snail's pace. I couldn't even watch the film in one sitting - I had to watch it 15 minutes at a time, and it was pure torture.<br /><br />Save yourself 30 minutes - do not watch this film - and you will thank me.<br /><br />I can only guess that the Oscar nominating committee only watched the first few minutes of the nominees. Unfortunately, to vote for the winner in the Best Animated Short (short!) category, the voters will have to sit through the whole thing. I already feel sorry for them - and must predict that there's no way this film will come close to winning.","finished_norm":["the","anim","in","thi","reimagin","of","peter","the","wolf","be","excel","but","at","minut","the","film","be","sleep","induc","thei","should","have","call","it","peter","the","snail","becaus","everyth","move","at","a","snail","pace","i","can","not","even","watch","the","film","in","on","sit","i","have","to","watch","it","minut","at","a","time","and","it","be","pure","torturebr","br","save","yourself","minut","do","not","watch","thi","film","and","you","will","thank","mebr","br","i","can","onli","guess","that","the","oscar","nomin","committe","onli","watch","the","few","minut","of","the","nomine","unfortun","to","vote","for","the","winner","in","the","well","anim","short","short","categori","the","voter","will","have","to","sit","through","the","whole","thing","i","alreadi","feel","sorri","for","them","and","must","predict","that","there","no","wai","thi","film","will","come","close","to","win"],"filtered":["anim","thi","reimagin","peter","wolf","excel","minut","film","sleep","induc","thei","call","peter","snail","becaus","everyth","move","snail","pace","even","watch","film","sit","watch","minut","time","pure","torturebr","br","save","minut","watch","thi","film","thank","mebr","br","onli","guess","oscar","nomin","committe","onli","watch","minut","nomine","unfortun","vote","winner","well","anim","short","short","categori","voter","sit","whole","thing","alreadi","feel","sorri","must","predict","wai","thi","film","come","close","win"],"filtered2":["anim","reimagin","peter","wolf","excel","minut","sleep","induc","call","peter","snail","becaus","everyth","move","snail","pace","even","watch","sit","watch","minut","time","pure","torturebr","save","minut","watch","thank","mebr","onli","guess","oscar","nomin","committe","onli","watch","minut","nomine","unfortun","vote","winner","well","anim","short","short","categori","voter","sit","whole","thing","alreadi","feel","sorri","must","predict","wai","come","close","win"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,8,11,20,22,29,33,34,43,59,111,141,142,189,193,227,243,244,272,275,277,295,330,337,437,489,546,580,651,725,732,760,979,1190,1473,1696,1795,1857,2339,3132,4759,6187,6418,6631,6909,8275],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,8,11,20,22,29,33,34,43,59,111,141,142,189,193,227,243,244,272,275,277,295,330,337,437,489,546,580,651,725,732,760,979,1190,1473,1696,1795,1857,2339,3132,4759,6187,6418,6631,6909,8275],"values":[0.926017105726131,3.8437990882891726,0.9418936859054116,1.982619630677639,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.6608112036218214,7.477301779680289,2.1183455303375887,2.2657547357741192,2.2844323215331563,2.498193474075453,2.517840471459249,2.6005321873043625,2.627841366673578,5.269016116063534,5.605761068896383,2.7832848715031413,6.232798466686559,2.7910771187233068,2.9292757465539174,2.973659465713028,3.1952392950510555,3.3956930001684253,3.4572130107926293,3.5039747767006686,3.5474598886404074,3.6466665387238555,3.7099788181381825,7.700135222617728,4.096025840389245,4.291900363587903,4.535724120139652,4.637773374493822,4.8796870284900224,5.143104478942172,5.170884043049248,5.444579873526289,12.275454108172468,6.600350576034347,6.600350576034347,6.543192162194399,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.641444427667334E-5,6.596659615248614E-5,6.647942353518034E-5,6.609530471776506E-5,6.609638761491785E-5,6.600399807361423E-5,6.620030321190113E-5,6.597609491129346E-5,6.612443322379324E-5,7.33614490712138E-5,0.4957639619247073,6.586959494798444E-5,6.709901827314916E-5,6.805620051288744E-5,6.591762636947549E-5,6.573545849096809E-5,6.737514727471362E-5,6.620650568061123E-5,6.60011002546482E-5,6.60558034319635E-5,6.66949320726754E-5,6.627209957434897E-5,6.634756041361788E-5,6.641904246847999E-5,6.692877449684869E-5,6.657875584812218E-5,6.93776002629314E-5,6.588917737460654E-5,6.58909400644057E-5,6.605787438844456E-5,0.1660228180018543,6.62026695789618E-5,0.08816230202681265,6.638888791918516E-5,6.596089478106468E-5,6.626534779234882E-5,6.589480031614334E-5,6.593373929494085E-5,6.57351282307097E-5,6.575218295571555E-5,6.590018312848865E-5,6.659529042203876E-5,6.625689176595672E-5,6.599493053730122E-5,0.10369948821793681,6.602025975226906E-5,0.056451699396835885,6.721068154635486E-5,6.576852596771675E-5,6.59138784321268E-5,6.589101701576993E-5,6.77454379217072E-5,6.591485910497866E-5,6.574634566437858E-5,6.646800589831463E-5,6.593183702287918E-5,7.090244462179127E-5,6.587750062215647E-5,6.576776539244415E-5,6.60817871693543E-5,6.673726296032292E-5,6.607741548325361E-5,6.575559820881453E-5,6.590870004829336E-5,6.573592330872183E-5,6.725691632380753E-5,6.630220743023E-5,6.616097402090618E-5,6.610311325894812E-5,6.6344069614463

{"value":"I saw an early screening of this film in New York and I, along with my friends and pretty much the entire audience, were vastly disappointed. The movie wasn't even so bad it was good; it was as lifeless as a snake-bite victim. Samual L. Jackson looked surprisingly tired through most of it and the snake effects were lame. It reminded me of one of those cheesy SciFi movies, except the cheesiness of this movie was not funny or even campy. It all seemed worn, flat, and overtly formulaic. I'm shocked to say I actually think Anaconda was more fun. It's easy to understand that SOAP realizes it's a piece of s*it and plays along with it, but what the film fails to embark on is a script that has any scares of suspense. It's the worst kind of lame movie: it's joyless.","finished_norm":["i","see","a","earli","screen","of","thi","film","in","new","york","and","i","along","with","my","friend","and","pretti","much","the","entir","audienc","be","vastli","disappoint","the","movi","be","not","even","so","bad","it","be","good","it","be","a","lifeless","a","a","snakebit","victim","samual","l","jackson","look","surprisingli","tire","through","much","of","it","and","the","snake","effect","be","lame","it","remind","me","of","on","of","that","cheesi","scifi","movi","except","the","cheesi","of","thi","movi","be","not","funni","or","even","campi","it","all","seem","wear","flat","and","overtli","formula","i","be","shock","to","sai","i","actual","think","anaconda","be","much","fun","it","easi","to","understand","that","soap","realiz","it","a","piec","of","sit","and","plai","along","with","it","but","what","the","film","fail","to","embark","on","be","a","script","that","have","ani","scare","of","suspens","it","the","wrong","kind","of","lame","movi","it","joyless"],"filtered":["see","earli","screen","thi","film","new","york","along","friend","pretti","much","entir","audienc","vastli","disappoint","movi","even","bad","good","lifeless","snakebit","victim","samual","l","jackson","look","surprisingli","tire","much","snake","effect","lame","remind","cheesi","scifi","movi","except","cheesi","thi","movi","funni","even","campi","seem","wear","flat","overtli","formula","shock","sai","actual","think","anaconda","much","fun","easi","understand","soap","realiz","piec","sit","plai","along","film","fail","embark","script","ani","scare","suspens","wrong","kind","lame","movi","joyless"],"filtered2":["see","earli","screen","new","york","along","friend","pretti","entir","audienc","vastli","disappoint","even","bad","good","lifeless","snakebit","victim","samual","l","jackson","look","surprisingli","tire","snake","effect","lame","remind","cheesi","scifi","except","cheesi","funni","even","campi","seem","wear","flat","overtli","formula","shock","actual","think","anaconda","fun","easi","understand","soap","realiz","piec","sit","plai","along","fail","embark","script","ani","scare","suspens","wrong","kind","lame","joyless"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,9,12,16,25,27,35,40,52,62,77,78,87,106,122,161,168,187,192,198,212,215,218,233,244,259,266,324,372,405,508,514,529,535,543,594,623,644,744,781,827,900,1176,1343,1406,1647,1657,1733,2140,3007,4194,5644,7469],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,9,12,16,25,27,35,40,52,62,77,78,87,106,122,161,168,187,192,198,212,215,218,233,244,259,266,324,372,405,508,514,529,535,543,594,623,644,744,781,827,900,1176,1343,1406,1647,1657,1733,2140,3007,4194,5644,7469],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.463169012899134,1.6284968758320737,1.7122153074726136,2.0226120445069267,1.9463902258768238,2.0064197866819473,2.115024371522662,2.159084361316692,2.2489347673732487,2.4323182980210873,2.4894767118610357,2.4732161909892554,2.5318267134339894,2.5439726117360975,2.5983793339432615,2.605934685587711,2.5940874818617203,2.6102777977348763,2.634508058031767,2.7464553122240485,2.747702973022204,5.7507322345565886,6.141071633100196,3.109204957709252,3.4149707055943286,3.405285399859865,3.4648563601051974,3.4986697244709752,6.955453101251464,3.490764544963862,3.607563812710113,3.5670958631572662,3.700222643192818,3.9363956947973615,4.062925891962901,3.9201351739255808,4.358390104856736,4.520909034354511,4.429617614145104,5.143104478942172,5.089758498236879,4.798834931860927,5.170884043049248,5.501738287366237,5.850044981634453,6.389041482367141,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.927874191742749E-5,6.881157916463056E-5,6.934652357741306E-5,6.894583862540951E-5,6.894696822535104E-5,6.885059414200889E-5,6.905536545584821E-5,6.882148758240194E-5,6.897622337489504E-5,0.08379124570760814,0.630844404974657,6.871039452798196E-5,6.999283996856315E-5,0.04724320867119779,6.876049743089182E-5,6.857047308335403E-5,7.028087775979436E-5,6.906183542233966E-5,6.884757134697601E-5,6.89046337427329E-5,6.957132648757407E-5,6.913025822531736E-5,6.920897351181143E-5,6.928353841835328E-5,0.032197656237702085,0.04901249955084023,7.236969180142966E-5,6.873082149827201E-5,6.873266020870626E-5,6.890679401466074E-5,7.037139179018728E-5,6.905783387871411E-5,7.412773466084116E-5,6.92520833747858E-5,6.880563190656668E-5,6.912321525495502E-5,6.873668694395612E-5,6.877730526865975E-5,6.85701285797531E-5,6.85879188346445E-5,6.874230190424558E-5,6.946738752860417E-5,6.91143945401776E-5,6.884113554433638E-5,6.967762752553898E-5,6.886755714833893E-5,7.115568408943056E-5,7.010931901420336E-5,6.860496668203548E-5,

{"value":"This was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life!! It was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous!! And i have never seen such bad acting in my life! The only good part about the movie were all the hot guys(especially Drew Fuller). I don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie!! I didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves. I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn! I would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch! I was very disappointed!!

{"value":"Terrible use of scene cuts. All continuity is lost, either by awful scripting or lethargic direction. That villainous robot... musta been a jazz dancer? Also, one of the worst sound tracks I've ever heard (monologues usually drowned out by music.) And... where'd they get their props? That ship looks like a milk carton... I did better special effects on 8mm at the age of 13!<br /><br />I'd recommend any film student should watch this flick (5 minutes at a time) so as to learn how NOT to produce a film. Or... was it the editors' fault?<br /><br />It's really too bad, because the scenario was actually a good concept... just poorly executed all the way around. (Sorry Malcom. You should have sent a \"stunt double\".

{"value":"please don't rent or even think about buying this movie.they don't even have it available at the red box to rent which would cost a $1 & i think its worth less than that.the main reason why i rented this d movie was because Jenna Jameson is in the movie lol between 2-5 min.i will give credit that the movie had hot chicks and quite a bit of nudity but other than that you might as well buy another d horror movie that has the same thing with nobody you know.Ginger Lynn has more acting time in this movie than Jenna & she's not even on the front cover of the movie nor her name.i recommend

{"value":"There is good. There is bad. And then their is The Sentinel, a bottom-barrel political \"thriller\" that ranks among the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot of a mole in the Secret Service is a good one, but never has a movie with so much potential been so utterly butchered. Directed with ham-handed \"edginess\" by Clark Johnson, every actor in this film seems to be working on autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can honestly say I have NEVER, in all my life, viewed another film with so many glaring plot holes. The twist is predictable from square one, and the character's motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired laughter from the audience. Avoid this at all costs. This is a catastrophe of a movie with no redeeming value.","finished_norm":["there","be","good","there","be","bad","and","then","their","be","the","sentinel","a","bottombarrel","polit","thriller","that","rank","among","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","the","plot","of","a","mole","in","the","secret","servic","be","a","good","on","but","never","have","a","movi","with","so","much","potenti","be","so","utterli","butcher","direct","with","hamhand","edgi","by","clark","johnson","everi","actor","in","thi","film","seem","to","be","work","on","autopilot","even","the","great","michael","dougla","look","bore","here","i","can","honestli","sai","i","have","never","in","all","my","life","view","anoth","film","with","so","mani","glare","plot","hole","the","twist","be","predict","from","squar","on","and","the","charact","motiv","be","so","utterli","ridicul","that","thei","inspir","laughter","from","the","audienc","avoid","thi","at","all","cost","thi","be","a","catastroph","of","a","movi","with","no","redeem","valu"],"filtered":["good","bad","sentinel","bottombarrel","polit","thriller","rank","among","wrong","movi","ever","see","plot","mole","secret","servic","good","never","movi","much","potenti","utterli","butcher","direct","hamhand","edgi","clark","johnson","everi","actor","thi","film","seem","work","autopilot","even","great","michael","dougla","look","bore","honestli","sai","never","life","view","anoth","film","mani","glare","plot","hole","twist","predict","squar","charact","motiv","utterli","ridicul","thei","inspir","laughter","audienc","avoid","thi","cost","thi","catastroph","movi","redeem","valu"],"filtered2":["good","bad","sentinel","bottombarrel","polit","thriller","rank","among","wrong","ever","see","plot","mole","secret","servic","good","never","potenti","utterli","butcher","direct","hamhand","edgi","clark","johnson","everi","actor","seem","work","autopilot","even","great","michael","dougla","look","bore","honestli","never","life","view","anoth","mani","glare","plot","hole","twist","predict","squar","charact","motiv","utterli","ridicul","inspir","laughter","audienc","avoid","cost","catastroph","redeem","valu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,9,10,16,25,32,35,41,42,44,48,50,51,73,75,85,102,108,168,274,312,335,337,435,451,466,547,575,634,714,757,798,810,816,826,837,902,909,1632,1654,1732,1773,1904,2144,2336,2475,3231,3557,4238,6547,6884,8451],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,9,10,16,25,32,35,41,42,44,48,50,51,73,75,85,102,108,168,274,312,335,337,435,451,466,547,575,634,714,757,798,810,816,826,837,902,909,1632,1654,1732,1773,1904,2144,2336,2475,3231,3557,4238,6547,6884,8451],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,1.2796387880827016,2.742262257014735,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,3.2439908614907673,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.8950689206770979,1.9742250248702675,2.011190219103739,2.087553710177271,2.138507503627933,2.4894767118610357,2.748952192422636,2.8824835850471584,2.908534262247101,2.973659465713028,3.2829611516442836,3.216957819005698,3.4446025032006995,3.432149042129413,3.6314455447135003,3.5119855004467477,3.7297814454343623,3.7165362186843414,3.9282323841582003,3.8425769395797067,7.576234044894651,3.8204358137024927,3.7881170224473255,3.9201351739255808,3.9612932464190886,4.6973654716960676,4.637773374493822,4.760735085628657,5.02684467282631,5.259176650194926,5.3064295350454715,5.2288713006995975,5.170884043049248,5.5623629091826725,5.649374286172302,5.967828017290836,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.661032909210219E-5,6.616116007081043E-5,6.667550000244333E-5,6.629024825311132E-5,6.629133434419447E-5,6.619867230632111E-5,6.639555643305247E-5,6.617068684555065E-5,6.631946267165583E-5,7.357782359737925E-5,0.5517331581721876,6.606387276795695E-5,6.729692219228967E-5,6.82569275749211E-5,6.611204585480766E-5,6.592934068472689E-5,0.32217064791362304,6.640177719551556E-5,6.619576594043823E-5,6.625063046099608E-5,6.689164416748222E-5,6.646756455391161E-5,6.654324795971303E-5,6.661494084595791E-5,6.712617629373159E-5,6.677512528918023E-5,6.958222470224443E-5,6.608351295159362E-5,6.608528084032456E-5,6.625270752562022E-5,6.766089331415058E-5,6.639792977954933E-5,7.127255293544177E-5,6.658469735790304E-5,6.61554418835878E-5,6.646079285799685E-5,6.608915247760805E-5,6.612820630423359E-5,6.592900945038869E-5,6.594611447712779E-5,6.609455116618651E-5,6.679170863068036E-5,6.645231189113906E-5,6.618957802593614E-5,6.699385080296233E-5,6.621498194767377E-5,6.841497698702188E-5,0.12095958608896601,6.59625056917139E-5,6.610828686317667E-5,6.608535801865152E-5,6.794524841094592E-5,6.610927042845536E-5,

I can see now why it went straight to video. <br /><br />I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush it could have some value. All have done wonderful work in the past. <br /><br />The movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. I failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end. <br /><br />I do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. It won't satisfy even that.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","never","make","it","to","theater","in","our","area","so","when","it","becom","avail","on","dvd","i","be","on","of","the","to","rend","it","for","onc","i","should","listen","to","the","critic","and","pass","on","thi","onebr","br","despit","the","excel","line","up","of","actor","the","movi","be","veri","disappoint","i","can","see","now","why","it","go","straight","to","video","br","br","i","have","think","that","with","bloom","ledger","and","rush","it","can","have","some","valu","all","have","do","wonder","work","in","the","past","br","br","the","movi","be","slow","move","and","never","pull","me","in","i","fail","to","develop","much","empathi","for","the","charact","and","have","to","fight","the","urg","to","fastforward","just","to","get","to","the","end","br","br","i","do","not","recommend","thi","film","even","if","you","be","think","of","rent","it","for","onli","for","ey","candi","purpos","it","wo","not","satisfi","even","that"],"filtered":["thi","movi","never","make","theater","area","becom","avail","dvd","rend","onc","listen","critic","pass","thi","onebr","br","despit","excel","line","actor","movi","veri","disappoint","see","go","straight","video","br","br","think","bloom","ledger","rush","valu","wonder","work","past","br","br","movi","slow","move","never","pull","fail","develop","much","empathi","charact","fight","urg","fastforward","get","end","br","br","recommend","thi","film","even","think","rent","onli","ey","candi","purpos","wo","satisfi","even"],"filtered2":["never","make","theater","area","becom","avail","dvd","rend","onc","listen","critic","pass","onebr","despit","excel","line","actor","veri","disappoint","see","go","straight","video","think","bloom","ledger","rush","valu","wonder","work","past","slow","move","never","pull","fail","develop","empathi","charact","fight","urg","fastforward","get","end","recommend","even","think","rent","onli","ey","candi","purpos","wo","satisfi","even"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,10,11,12,15,24,41,42,48,107,115,175,187,215,232,236,240,247,275,281,298,320,390,391,406,424,440,451,487,531,544,548,579,580,661,794,845,1156,1363,1586,1587,1685,1788,2596,3258,3348,5619,5689],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,10,11,12,15,24,41,42,48,107,115,175,187,215,232,236,240,247,275,281,298,320,390,391,406,424,440,451,487,531,544,548,579,580,661,794,845,1156,1363,1586,1587,1685,1788,2596,3258,3348,5619,5689],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,1.2000607798565692,1.3210361566119257,1.5687599167621034,3.2439908614907673,1.6955116224012472,2.1439533986393955,2.201553588425805,2.3791142619576227,2.4732161909892554,2.605934685587711,2.8377834061292515,2.617923930016232,2.7666071276613566,2.7303758068497004,2.7832848715031413,2.832333801361687,2.7819920465008363,2.938298364153555,3.132778125427319,3.109204957709252,3.121829110937649,3.212973749990824,3.212973749990824,3.216957819005698,3.3220965805878846,3.424750734647968,3.4222967456864013,3.459754308221302,3.5642670069567886,3.5039747767006686,3.5727776966246974,3.7465885637507435,3.831445099210862,4.2860694432771105,4.436351646326448,4.589376833631972,4.573751515728891,4.662879295624898,4.828393734102471,5.185068678041204,5.501738287366237,5.5623629091826725,6.342521466732247,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.699772114551667E-5,7.64785075112347E-5,7.707305498111909E-5,7.662772604835143E-5,7.662898150736953E-5,7.652186950461869E-5,7.674945626623156E-5,7.648951991659078E-5,7.666149624110047E-5,8.505174529330988E-5,0.827469539021509,7.636604896736904E-5,7.779138340164474E-5,0.031613254350586324,7.642173429363308E-5,7.621053759291913E-5,7.811151412161401E-5,7.675664711095452E-5,7.65185099123025E-5,0.1349790331735353,7.732290524268863E-5,7.683269352516266E-5,7.692017920275455E-5,7.700305206854641E-5,7.759401093309354E-5,7.718821610029931E-5,8.043306206909797E-5,7.638875189352951E-5,7.639079547153576E-5,7.658433111987174E-5,7.821211314923867E-5,7.675219971869964E-5,8.238698458709308E-5,7.696809233044788E-5,7.647189761467323E-5,7.682486583295887E-5,7.639527086224457E-5,7.644041484656599E-5,7.621015470501638E-5,7.622992713516342E-5,7.640151143669275E-5,7.720738549222233E-5,7.681506232155063E-5,7.651135703793905E-5,7.744105025300733E-5,7.654072251486457E-5,7.908379063763311E-5,7.792084044470409E-5,7.624887443938996E-5,7.64173891148397E-5,7.63908846852565E-5,7.854081133685878E-5,7.641852605990646E-5,7.622315965957127E-5,7.70598179205805E-5,7.643820944357959E-5,8.220089348005874E-5,7.637521442681082E-5,7.624799266489965E-5,7.661205445108914E-5,7.737198164343885E-5,7.660698612791062E-5,7.623388661

{"value":"This may be one of the worst movies to ever make it to production, ever.<br /><br />1. The most exciting part is the beginning, where the guy is walking... and walking... and walking (spoiler). There is about 15 minutes of just walking. How? <br /><br />2. Not to mention there's a lot of issues with the lighting, and it's almost like they even shot the night scenes during the day. <br /><br />3. The acting was TERRIBLE. It looks like they found a community theater (in Mexico)... and then took the people who were turned away.<br /><br />Please, for the love of everything holy, don't rent this movie. If you know someone who owns it, apologize to them. The director should be subject to punishment through the war crimes tribunal for foisting this on the

Harvey Keitle is a great actor but who knows maybe he is in financial crunch to take a part in such a fiasco film. . . . . this movie should have been presented to all the students in all the film schools just to teach them a lesson of how not to make a

{"value":"It is only Robert De Niro film which I really hates. It is stupid film with horrible acting (of course not De Niro). For me, Brian De Palma must do his mafia films as always like Scarface (1983) or The Untouchables (1987). I also loved De Palma's Mission: Impossible (1996). De Niro worked with Palma two different times too, Greetings and The Wedding Party. I though that The Wedding Party was OK too (I didn't watch Greetings). <br /><br />Screenplay is really bad and unfunny. There are no any scene where I can smile for even one time. Film lost a chance to be a funny style even a little bit in a \"Be Black baby\" scene and also I don't like the scene where a guy's sexual organ appeared. So, it is one of the worst film I have ever seen! just worst. I hate

{"value":"A fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do. that being stealing from farms and killing prey. until a trio of farmers decide they've had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem \"solved\". They are of course \"out foxed\" at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land.<br /><br />The\"film\" version ,and I use the term film very loosely, is more of a god awful pastiche of American heist movies particularly the Oceans movies. They they even have George clooney as Mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely.

{"value":"This could have been a good episode but I simply had to turn it off. The British representation was horrible to watch. Have the makers ever set foot in Britain prior to filming? At least set foot in England?? I don't think any British person have had such an accent apart from a comedy skit of The Royal Family! Also with the 2 English boys... well I don't think any English boy has acted, spoke or dressed like any English kid in the history of the British nation since Prince William and Harry's preteen public appearances. To American film makers.. There is more than 1 country in the UK. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.. meaning more than 1 culture! I can handle some stereotyping but this was so bad I could not watch it.

{"value":"There are bad movies, then there are the movies that are SO bad, that they become almost art. This is one of those films. My partner and I are still both kind of shell shocked, you know, staring off into space and drooling! You can tell that the people involved (I hope they changed their names to protect themselves) were having a blast, and they definitely weren't shy. I give this one a three out of ten just because of the gratuitous smut and REALLY bad gore effects. I laughed out loud during most of the movie, so I guess you could say that it showed me a good time. Beware viewer, the above words in no way construe that this is a good film, because it is not. All I can say in my defense, is that it was impossible to pass up a movie with such a GREAT

I haven't seen anything worse than Natascha McElhone impersonating some sort of agent, carrying a gun. You don't use a spoiled city-brat-look in such a role. The only worse thing I can imagine is casting Doris Day as a prostitute. The rest of the cast is likewise awful, possibly with Hurt as the sole exception, sometimes you can see him trying, but suffering. Oh, did I mention that it is a completely insane story? Jeopardizing many peoples lives because you are divorced and want to see your family? Well, it must be because the guy (Weller) is German?<br /><br />2/10, because the photography could be worse.","finished_norm":["realli","everybodi","in","thi","movi","look","like","thei","want","to","be","someplac","els","no","wonder","the","cast","be","do","not","with","the","leav","hand","but","rather","not","at","all","i","have","not","see","anyth","wrong","than","natascha","mcelhon","imperson","some","sort","of","agent","carri","a","gun","you","do","not","us","a","spoil","citybratlook","in","such","a","role","the","onli","wrong","thing","i","can","imagin","be","cast","dori","dai","a","a","prostitut","the","rest","of","the","cast","be","likewis","aw","possibli","with","hurt","a","the","sole","except","sometim","you","can","see","him","try","but","suffer","oh","do","i","mention","that","it","be","a","complet","insan","stori","jeopard","mani","peopl","live","becaus","you","be","divorc","and","want","to","see","your","famili","good","it","must","be","becaus","the","gui","weller","be","germanbr","br","becaus","the","photographi","can","be","wrong"],"filtered":["realli","everybodi","thi","movi","look","like","thei","want","someplac","els","wonder","cast","leav","hand","rather","see","anyth","wrong","natascha","mcelhon","imperson","sort","agent","carri","gun","us","spoil","citybratlook","role","onli","wrong","thing","imagin","cast","dori","dai","prostitut","rest","cast","likewis","aw","possibli","hurt","sole","except","sometim","see","try","suffer","oh","mention","complet","insan","stori","jeopard","mani","peopl","live","becaus","divorc","want","see","famili","good","must","becaus","gui","weller","germanbr","br","becaus","photographi","wrong"],"filtered2":["realli","everybodi","look","like","want","someplac","els","wonder","cast","leav","hand","rather","see","anyth","wrong","natascha","mcelhon","imperson","sort","agent","carri","gun","us","spoil","citybratlook","role","onli","wrong","thing","imagin","cast","dori","dai","prostitut","rest","cast","likewis","aw","possibli","hurt","sole","except","sometim","see","try","suffer","oh","mention","complet","insan","stori","jeopard","mani","peopl","live","becaus","divorc","want","see","famili","good","must","becaus","gui","weller","germanbr","becaus","photographi","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,11,13,16,17,22,23,25,29,36,37,50,55,56,74,92,103,104,116,128,132,138,141,160,175,182,196,226,233,234,235,269,285,340,500,501,558,621,633,863,1069,1193,1215,1285,1371,1466,2217,2785,2987,4294,4727],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,11,13,16,17,22,23,25,29,36,37,50,55,56,74,92,103,104,116,128,132,138,141,160,175,182,196,226,233,234,235,269,285,340,500,501,558,621,633,863,1069,1193,1215,1285,1371,1466,2217,2785,2987,4294,4727],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.6786144649922705,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,3.893772050208532,1.364847727375781,3.838916364248105,1.3195384777338066,1.4680183469605717,2.975308642954861,1.717994385570355,1.9536997889255368,1.8610609350701788,1.9486336368009016,6.146860610740767,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.2466628996789315,2.3409902041158843,2.253494045787767,2.2907365189289424,2.2657547357741192,2.3722295531801256,2.3791142619576227,2.7365296724240786,2.478925055209576,2.5940874818617203,2.6102777977348763,2.673149229007135,2.6457189377809835,2.76533567167316,2.808171552082607,2.948928684455311,3.3814747511661465,3.5119855004467477,3.4572130107926293,3.5446859617576822,3.550241531602284,3.944626193933877,4.2860694432771105,4.240607069200353,4.291900363587903,4.449957298382227,4.403125998698128,4.499089986959872,5.089758498236879,5.426230734858092,5.501738287366237,5.967828017290836,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.830449625518906E-5,7.777647073084349E-5,7.838110862708861E-5,7.792822174641938E-5,7.79294985125953E-5,7.782056864696412E-5,7.805201792179091E-5,7.778767003442205E-5,7.796256507362847E-5,8.649521014045055E-5,0.8208099239035054,7.766210358469964E-5,7.911162823569813E-5,8.024017299615537E-5,7.771873398047033E-5,7.750395293222463E-5,7.943719208862866E-5,7.805933080670884E-5,7.781715203696542E-5,7.788164862035002E-5,7.863519924925723E-5,7.81366678508186E-5,7.822563830100154E-5,7.830991765255262E-5,7.891090603905887E-5,7.849822421559479E-5,0.17307479861119468,7.768519181601437E-5,7.768727007682464E-5,7.788409033624154E-5,7.953949844347547E-5,7.805480793505776E-5,8.378522416116969E-5,7.827436459149715E-5,7.776974865371127E-5,7.812870731009429E-5,7.769182142210845E-5,7.773773157241744E-5,7.750356354609864E-5,7.75236715461715E-5,7.769816790913737E-5,7.851771894291553E-5,7.811873741733729E-5,7.780987776682503E-5,7.875534937033141E-5,7.783974162310204E-5,8.042596970016006E-5,7.924328237289384E-5,7.754294041661053E-5,7.77143150570075E-5,7.768736080464564E-5,7.987377516775598E-5,7.771547129785

{"value":"I was expecting the movie based on Grendel, the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970's. It was based on the Beowulf epic, but told from the perspective of the monster. <br /><br />Whatever you may think of Gardner's book, a movie based on the Beowulf epic should not be entitled Grendel, when it doesn't say anything more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the CG monster is shown as nothing more than a modified Predator. <br /><br />On top of this, the writers should also be punished for screwing up the original story so badly and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of mass TV audiences throughout the US.<br /><br />Typical Hollywood to get this

{"value":"Burt Reynolds came to a point in his career where he appeared to just be going thru the motions. He'd show up, party with his friends on film, and take home a big paycheck. It didn't seem to matter to him that the product he was representing was pure crap.<br /><br />No film epitomized this more than \"Stroker Ace\" which makes \"Cannonball Run\" look like a classic and \"Cannonball Run II\" look watchable. Save for a few race scenes there is absolutely NOTHING worth seeing here. Even the beautiful Loni Anderson hams it up so bad as a dumb blonde it's embarrassing.<br /><br />If the thought of Burt hamming it up with Jim Nabors and dressing like a chicken sounds funny then this is your movie.

{"value":"A friend of mine was in the cast as a FEDS agent (a non-speaking part, as I recall). He brought it over on DVD so I could see it. It was \"interesting\", but very much felt like an amateur film. A well made amateur film, though. Really boring and poorly written. It was probably fun to make and be involved in, but it definitely didn't deserve any kind of wide release. Maybe in Omaha they'd enjoy it, but this California girl was bored and honestly kind of embarrassed for my friend's involvement.<br /><br />If this film maker has made or makes any more films, he really should try to have a really interesting story line, and GOOD actors. I'm sure this was a great learning tool for them.

{"value":"I'm not looking for quality; I'm just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in Britain. This one was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut.<br /><br />Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation. There are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids. Which of them is the slasher? The actual killings are not very gory, so this video nastie is not really nasty. There is the requisite flashing of the boobies, but it has nothing to do with the college kids.<br /><br />I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be right. Maybe I've seen too many of these. The end twist was clever; I have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality.","finished_norm":["i","be","not","look","for","qualiti","i","be","just","try","to","get","through","the","famou","video","nasti","that","be","ban","in","britain","thi","on","be","initi","ban","and","rereleas","in","with","a","whole","second","cutbr","br","some","colleg","kid","spend","their","christma","vacat","prepar","a","dorm","for","renov","there","be","some","creepi","charact","lurk","about","along","with","the","four","kid","which","of","them","be","the","slasher","the","actual","kill","be","not","veri","gori","so","thi","video","nasti","be","not","realli","nasti","there","be","the","requisit","flash","of","the","boobi","but","it","have","noth","to","do","with","the","colleg","kidsbr","br","i","have","a","suspect","veri","quickli","and","i","turn","out","to","be","right","mayb","i","have","see","too","mani","of","thi","the","end","twist","be","clever","i","have","to","give","the","writer","credit","for","that","bite","of","origin"],"filtered":["look","qualiti","try","get","famou","video","nasti","ban","britain","thi","initi","ban","rereleas","whole","second","cutbr","br","colleg","kid","spend","christma","vacat","prepar","dorm","renov","creepi","charact","lurk","along","four","kid","slasher","actual","kill","veri","gori","thi","video","nasti","realli","nasti","requisit","flash","boobi","noth","colleg","kidsbr","br","suspect","veri","quickli","turn","right","mayb","see","mani","thi","end","twist","clever","give","writer","credit","bite","origin"],"filtered2":["look","qualiti","try","get","famou","video","nasti","ban","britain","initi","ban","rereleas","whole","second","cutbr","colleg","kid","spend","christma","vacat","prepar","dorm","renov","creepi","charact","lurk","along","four","kid","slasher","actual","kill","veri","gori","video","nasti","realli","nasti","requisit","flash","boobi","noth","colleg","kidsbr","suspect","veri","quickli","turn","right","mayb","see","mani","end","twist","clever","give","writer","credit","bite","origin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,10,13,15,16,24,30,36,49,50,52,69,76,96,111,114,121,154,163,240,283,287,319,324,356,435,606,731,748,755,771,814,865,947,955,977,1052,1226,1295,1455,1488,2319,2346,3296,3385,6077,6179,6733,7415,8201],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,10,13,15,16,24,30,36,49,50,52,69,76,96,111,114,121,154,163,240,283,287,319,324,356,435,606,731,748,755,771,814,865,947,955,977,1052,1226,1295,1455,1488,2319,2346,3296,3385,6077,6179,6733,7415,8201],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,2.4001215597131385,1.1966138720291084,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,1.6920303308087352,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,2.127032521151058,2.1337665533324026,2.0390708128715254,2.1183455303375887,4.886614839193365,2.2190595059394194,2.348499626138016,2.4000574358028657,5.533214255322713,2.7678802023081546,2.841890188081905,2.9056060024680126,2.8753661172782943,3.028335462059722,3.2829611516442836,3.584239140143704,4.096025840389245,4.246178114249808,3.79165684915245,3.7264536553416874,7.872791389594723,3.9201351739255808,3.9911462095687695,4.017463517886143,4.035401218572811,12.390777036094462,4.3095999406873045,4.358390104856736,4.499089986959872,4.581533656170946,10.549361673461783,5.274680836730892,5.7446844659766265,5.583416318380505,6.437831646536572,6.600350576034347,6.725513718988353,6.725513718988353,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.336202774590184E-5,6.293476277997837E-5,6.342402054920345E-5,6.305755588279143E-5,6.305858900984969E-5,6.297044570392779E-5,6.315772863242723E-5,6.294382497459063E-5,6.308534563887922E-5,6.998974729300627E-5,0.3257554104994057,6.284221976350113E-5,6.401513863211397E-5,6.49283286511334E-5,6.288804365458893E-5,6.271424823556361E-5,6.427857670871203E-5,6.316364603486556E-5,6.296768106909982E-5,6.301987008124304E-5,6.362962428617601E-5,6.322622522468243E-5,6.329821787392551E-5,6.336641460421266E-5,6.38527192820012E-5,6.351878753607254E-5,0.3644050150989408,6.286090217923878E-5,6.286258385558462E-5,6.302184585629383E-5,6.436136043639556E-5,6.315998624094881E-5,0.05392444669687075,6.333764596194075E-5,6.292932344433187E-5,6.321978375546459E-5,6.286626668964836E-5,6.290341602789603E-5,6.271393315410982E-5,6.273020404172754E-5,6.287140210723544E-5,6.353456217881296E-5,6.321171636914958E-5,0.07552041009474902,6.372684674043159E-5,6.298595999370834E-5,0.050217809806510215,6.412166984670312E-5,6.274579592676326E-5,6.288446797293017E-5,6.286265727025409E-5,6.463184874922047E-5,6.28854035739297E-5,6.272463503306261E-5,6.34131276684189E-5,6.290160118450668E-5,0.12549206027992393,6.284976209185596E-5,6.274507030762948E-5,6.304465960267062E-5,6.367000964070005E-5,6.304048883983395E-5,6.27334623293481

{"value":"The American Humane Association, which is the source of the familiar disclaimer \"No animals were harmed...\" (the registered trademark of the AHA), began to monitor the use of animals in film production more than 60 years ago, after a blindfolded horse was forced to leap to its death from the top of a cliff for a shot in the film Jesse James (1939). Needless to say, the atrocious act kills the whole entertainment aspect of this film for me. I suppose one could say that at least the horse didn't die in vain, since it was the beginning of the public waking up to the callous and horrendous pain caused animals for the glory of movie making, but I can't help but feel that if the poor animal had a choice, this sure wouldn't have been the path he would have taken!","finished_norm":["the","american","human","associ","which","be","the","sourc","of","the","familiar","disclaim","no","anim","be","harm","the","regist","trademark","of","the","aha","begin","to","monitor","the","us","of","anim","in","film","product","much","than","year","ago","after","a","blindfold","hors","be","forc","to","leap","to","it","death","from","the","top","of","a","cliff","for","a","shoot","in","the","film","jess","jame","needless","to","sai","the","atroci","act","kill","the","whole","entertain","aspect","of","thi","film","for","me","i","suppos","on","can","sai","that","at","littl","the","hors","do","not","die","in","vain","sinc","it","be","the","begin","of","the","public","wake","up","to","the","callou","and","horrend","pain","caus","anim","for","the","glori","of","movi","make","but","i","ca","not","help","but","feel","that","if","the","poor","anim","have","a","choic","thi","sure","would","not","have","be","the","path","he","would","have","take"],"filtered":["american","human","associ","sourc","familiar","disclaim","anim","harm","regist","trademark","aha","begin","monitor","us","anim","film","product","much","year","ago","blindfold","hors","forc","leap","death","top","cliff","shoot","film","jess","jame","needless","sai","atroci","act","kill","whole","entertain","aspect","thi","film","suppos","sai","littl","hors","die","vain","sinc","begin","public","wake","callou","horrend","pain","caus","anim","glori","movi","make","ca","help","feel","poor","anim","choic","thi","sure","path","take"],"filtered2":["american","human","associ","sourc","familiar","disclaim","anim","harm","regist","trademark","aha","begin","monitor","us","anim","product","year","ago","blindfold","hors","forc","leap","death","top","cliff","shoot","jess","jame","needless","atroci","act","kill","whole","entertain","aspect","suppos","littl","hors","die","vain","sinc","begin","public","wake","callou","horrend","pain","caus","anim","glori","make","ca","help","feel","poor","anim","choic","sure","path","take"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,14,21,31,43,56,57,76,81,111,117,119,146,147,149,162,185,190,195,223,245,277,292,293,338,364,453,459,610,620,645,780,808,1095,1126,1219,1375,1588,1686,1742,2090,2097,2205,2771,2809,2874,2920,3197,3425,3799,4345,7052],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,14,21,31,43,56,57,76,81,111,117,119,146,147,149,162,185,190,195,223,245,277,292,293,338,364,453,459,610,620,645,780,808,1095,1126,1219,1375,1588,1686,1742,2090,2097,2205,2771,2809,2874,2920,3197,3425,3799,4345,7052],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,1.4070669811451506,1.6608112036218214,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,2.1337665533324026,1.949757232424728,2.1183455303375887,2.2797301185117202,2.1653408989309972,2.326138445979858,4.568864643066313,2.3253197803590226,2.3586007221245198,2.518833027372001,2.558331832813986,2.51289241584188,2.825563294794476,2.7502029743242886,12.465596933373117,2.9752256367457734,2.9012296278682137,2.9720957437368454,2.9878441007049847,3.2872346624216657,3.2829611516442836,3.477726550625732,3.7568101178222815,3.558633189238533,3.7775721092707104,3.8023521382691974,4.1554492608600455,8.913660355339978,4.246178114249808,4.390138803171316,4.654440426979034,4.662879295624898,4.724033718778229,5.695894301807195,5.00274712124725,5.0768550934009715,5.426230734858092,5.390512652256013,5.373120909544144,5.463272006538442,5.626901430320244,5.604922523601468,5.719991853386255,5.9370563586240825,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.237482535866609E-5,6.195421732922883E-5,6.24358522925726E-5,6.207509727287471E-5,6.207611430345477E-5,6.198934430083645E-5,6.217370929629806E-5,6.196313833170326E-5,6.210245405491595E-5,6.889928273453653E-5,8.024304090370513E-5,6.18631161650729E-5,6.301776055055569E-5,6.391672275208179E-5,6.190822610403064E-5,6.173713847796359E-5,6.327709417047269E-5,6.217953450355229E-5,6.198662273997879E-5,6.203799862919637E-5,6.263825265195161E-5,6.22411386878686E-5,6.231200966664557E-5,6.237914386820162E-5,6.285787175029855E-5,6.252914277688966E-5,6.515774915131836E-5,6.18815075022881E-5,6.18831629775327E-5,6.203994362098602E-5,0.9950467258329945,6.21759317304952E-5,6.674059568250308E-5,6.23508234513628E-5,6.194886274031987E-5,6.223479757897722E-5,6.18867884317633E-5,6.192335897042536E-5,6.173682830558821E-5,6.175284568712872E-5,6.18918438377617E-5,6.254467164522033E-5,6.222685588534144E-5,6.198082829200558E-5,6.273396034662091E-5,6.200461687259672E-5,6.406472238835735E-5,6.31226319718412E-5,6.176819464518315E-5,6.190470613273335E-5,6.188323524837615E-5,6.362486210995817E-5,6.190562715674453E-5,6.174736344555198E-5,6.242512912665194E-5,6.192157240292602E-5,6.658984576251349E-5,6.187054098133379E-5,6.176748033144737E-5

Not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey.<br /><br />The director more than likely committed a murder-suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent Warner Bros. film and he ended up owing money to the studio. It also doesn't help that he wasn't even infamous for the terrible job he did, he wasn't even known for producing a poop-chute film.<br /><br />Why was this movie ever

{"value":"No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up acting to become a full-time photographer; it's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one. While this movie is not without its interesting elements (mullets from hell, etc.), it is outweighed by flaws. For one thing, Angela, the murderous counselor, appears to be about the same age as the campers. Having an older, more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film. And then you have the murder scenes. The budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly (no pun intended), although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original. But overall, there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier/more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life

{"value":"I remember that show. I still remember that kick ass fun song \"America's Funniest People.\" Frankly it should've been titled American's lame or unfunny or downright disgusting People. Dave couldn't save this show and neither could Bob Saget or the replacement hosts for AFV that came later. The Jackalope segments were hilarious and yes Dave could make some good voice overs that were better than Bob's. But this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people submitted. Also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest stars including the Olson Twins. Plus AFV was in it's prime before they started picking the drooling ugly as sin babies as the winner. Did I mentioned the videos were disgusting and lame?

{"value":"The final film for Ernst Lubitsch, completed by Otto Preminger after Lubitsch's untimely death during production, is a juggling act of sophistication and silliness, romance and music, fantasy and costume dramatics. In a 19th century castle in Southeastern Europe, a Countess falls for her sworn enemy, the leader of the Hungarian revolt; she's aided by her ancestor, whose painted image magically comes to life. Betty Grable, in a long blonde wig adorned with flowers, has never been more beautiful, and her songs are very pleasant. Unfortunately, this script (by Samson Raphaelson, taken from an operetta by Rudolf Schanzer and E. Welisch) is awash with different ideas that fail to mesh--or entertain.

{"value":"Kid found as a baby in the garbage and raised at a martial arts academy has a knack for sinking baskets. With the help of the man who found him he gets in to college and is promoted to the championship as he searches for his real parents. Infinitely better in pieces action comedy is a real mess as a whole. It seems to be striving for a hipper basketball version of Shaolin Soccer, but the comedy is scatter shot, its focus wanders more than a Chihuahua with ADD on quadruple espresso. I kept asking \"What am I watching\". I watched it from start to finish and I still don't know what the hell happened. Its a shame since there are some great action scenes, some amusing jokes and the occasional moment, but nothing, none of it ever comes together, I'd take a

{"value":"This movie is just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I feel better. This movie is poor from beginning to end. The story is lame. The 3-D segment is really bad. Freddy is at his cartoon character worst. Thank God they killed him off. And who wants to see Roseanne and Tom Arnold cameos?<br /><br />The only good thing in the movie is the little bit of backstory that we're given on Freddy. We see he once had a family, and we get to see his abusive, alcoholic father (Alice Cooper).<br /><br />Other than that, all bad. There are some quality actors in here (Lisa Zane and Yaphet Kotto), and they do their best, but the end result is just so bad.

{"value":"Tim Robbins is oddly benign here, cast as a garage mechanic in 1950s New Jersey who falls in love with a perky blonde who turns out to be Albert Einstein's niece! Although he's on-screen much of the time, Robbins cancels out the inner-workings of his intense persona and fades into the background (it's easy to forget he's even in the picture!). Lumpy romantic comedy with a gimmick, that being Walter Matthau playing Einstein (who does what he can with a cartoonishly conceived character). Otherwise, it's sugary and sunny, directed rather drowsily by Fred Schepisi, who shows heart but no wit or brains. Meg Ryan is her usual affable self and the chemistry between she and Robbins is charming, like that of an affectionate sister and her big brother. ** from

After watching the show I wouldn't want to work for the guy with his ego and all and I think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve.<br /><br />I'd love to hear just one person get up and say \"Donald I quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo\". I see he's even trying to buy fame in the wrestling WWE. I hope he gets hurt so I don't have to see his pathetic face anymore. It must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it. I'd give this show a negative mark if I could but it gets a 1 and it doesn't deserve that.","finished_norm":["i","ca","not","stand","much","realiti","show","and","thi","on","be","wrong","than","the","on","with","pari","hilton","and","sure","it","hi","compani","but","you","re","fire","or","you","re","hire","for","how","mani","season","now","after","watch","the","show","i","would","not","want","to","work","for","the","gui","with","hi","ego","and","all","and","i","think","watch","paint","spindri","have","much","entertain","valvebr","br","i","have","love","to","hear","just","on","person","get","up","and","sai","donald","i","quit","and","take","some","of","your","monei","and","bui","a","decent","hairdo","i","see","he","even","try","to","bui","fame","in","the","wrestl","wwe","i","hope","he","get","hurt","so","i","do","not","have","to","see","hi","pathet","face","anymor","it","must","be","sad","to","want","fame","so","bad","and","have","no","talent","and","make","a","ass","of","yourself","try","to","bui","it","i","have","give","thi","show","a","neg","mark","if","i","can","but","it","get","a","and","it","doe","not","deserv","that"],"filtered":["ca","stand","much","realiti","show","thi","wrong","pari","hilton","sure","hi","compani","re","fire","re","hire","mani","season","watch","show","want","work","gui","hi","ego","think","watch","paint","spindri","much","entertain","valvebr","br","love","hear","person","get","sai","donald","quit","take","monei","bui","decent","hairdo","see","even","try","bui","fame","wrestl","wwe","hope","get","hurt","see","hi","pathet","face","anymor","must","sad","want","fame","bad","talent","make","ass","try","bui","give","thi","show","neg","mark","get","doe","deserv"],"filtered2":["ca","stand","realiti","show","wrong","pari","hilton","sure","compani","re","fire","re","hire","mani","season","watch","show","want","work","gui","ego","think","watch","paint","spindri","entertain","valvebr","love","hear","person","get","donald","quit","take","monei","bui","decent","hairdo","see","even","try","bui","fame","wrestl","wwe","hope","get","hurt","see","pathet","face","anymor","must","sad","want","fame","bad","talent","make","ass","try","bui","give","show","neg","mark","get","doe","deserv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,7,9,12,18,25,28,30,31,36,37,48,50,54,55,68,81,119,120,126,141,153,181,195,216,251,276,309,347,377,423,455,551,601,656,717,817,863,868,882,1014,1147,1352,1447,1661,1894,1973,2273,2664,2793,5725,6876],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,7,9,12,18,25,28,30,31,36,37,48,50,54,55,68,81,119,120,126,141,153,181,195,216,251,276,309,347,377,423,455,551,601,656,717,817,863,868,882,1014,1147,1352,1447,1661,1894,1973,2273,2664,2793,5725,6876],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,2.389902141215977,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.2153159934048174,1.2796387880827016,4.635688258055728,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,2.9360366939211433,2.975308642954861,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.8113893252729412,1.9536997889255368,4.012839573363895,1.949757232424728,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.2391270689902285,2.2657547357741192,2.3409902041158843,2.4442286541160034,2.51289241584188,2.6070186965339692,2.6942272927333892,2.7884729505849193,2.848772527704847,9.045596952463054,3.0602441305135506,3.164467636384302,3.2787058260741455,3.528202072035993,3.506637894120152,3.68099128126493,3.7398317812878634,4.197121957260614,3.944626193933877,3.944626193933877,3.9612932464190886,4.1302590120314875,4.246178114249808,4.436351646326448,4.477736862489302,4.688631791727313,5.1994574154933035,9.801928853874614,5.373120909544144,5.3560264761848435,5.444579873526289,6.389041482367141,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.808552422471641E-5,6.762640761777296E-5,6.815213845189796E-5,6.775835466987384E-5,6.775946481422772E-5,6.766475062334578E-5,6.786599507240855E-5,6.763614537858573E-5,6.778821608969617E-5,0.1471219410972584,0.6839147366980661,6.75269657278218E-5,6.878732305670688E-5,6.976858933516398E-5,6.7576205686796E-5,6.73894542106651E-5,6.907039984865961E-5,6.787235360387282E-5,6.766177989121727E-5,6.771785947668747E-5,6.837306948444755E-5,6.793959793136383E-5,6.801695747048241E-5,6.80902381134352E-5,6.861279570980737E-5,6.825397010422534E-5,0.11887286846885792,6.754704087558038E-5,6.75488479171107E-5,6.77199825413189E-5,6.915935491681514E-5,6.786842098056135E-5,7.285100067188778E-5,6.805932483366815E-5,6.762056279190326E-5,6.793267626512182E-5,6.755280529816026E-5,6.759272403591494E-5,6.738911564059848E-5,6.74065994862465E-5,6.755832354956361E-5,6.827092071105798E-5,6.792400747332458E-5,0.044916101116233044,6.847753965372544E-5,6.768142146849169E-5,6.993013901106201E-5,6.890179593343812E-5,6.742335371119909E-5,6.757236344612191E-5,6.7548926804

{"value":"It pains me to write such a scathing review but by not doing so I'm simply encouraging these people. First off, just because a film is made on a small budget does not automatically make it good nor endearing. In fact in this case, the small budget is probably the films sole achievement in that it prevented large sums of money from being squandered on a one legged race horse with the shits. Have you ever seen a comedy at the theatre? Ever heard people laugh and thought \"what the dickens are you on\"? Well even these twats weren't laughing.

{"value":"Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel \"The Celestine Prophecy\", which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Home video quality actors present so-called characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum, while the film is propelled by the extremely heavy-handed direction of Armand Mastroianni. Even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of ABC's \"Lost\" or Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\", the filmmakers are hardly up to the task.

{"value":"First of all there is Gujarati Theatre then there is Bollywood. Both have their strengths and fan following. Director Vipul Shah should look elsewhere instead of Gujarati Theatre when making a Bollywood production. First he made Aankhen (adapted from a Gujarati play) - which had a unique plot, but could not hold as a Hindi film. Now he's adapted another Gujarati play and named it Waqt - a race against time. In sum, the emotions are alien. The plot development is not for Hindi films. For example, the role play between father and son is best left to Gujarati Theatre - don't bring it in a Hindi film. Even the comedy track is best left for the Gujarati stage.
