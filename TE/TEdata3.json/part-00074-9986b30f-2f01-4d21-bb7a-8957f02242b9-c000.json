{"value":"not to long after Jeff Jarrett left the WWF for good he spoke of that night . Owen Hart and him where good friends and both 2nd generation wrestlers.

{"value":"Herbie, the Volkswagen that thinks like a man, is back, now being driven by Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan), a young woman who hopes to become a NASCAR champion. The only thing standing in her way is the current champion, Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), who will do anything to stop them.<br /><br />The original love bug wasn't that good. Even as a kid, I remember not liking it very much. I had some hope for the sequel though. I mean the cast is pretty good and the trailer makes it seem like a pretty fun movie. Unfortunately, Herbie is no better now than he was before. The film is defiantly weak for people over the age of 12. It will probably entertain the kids but that's all.<br /><br />I realize it's a kids film and all but they could have made the film a little more interesting. There were very few laughs and it got boring near the end. Most of the actors seemed dead in their roles too. Lindsay Lohan was alright as Maggie Peyton. She usually gives better performances like in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Matt Dillon gave the best performance out of everyone. He was very good as the bad guy even though he didn't have a lot to work with. Justin Long, Breckin Meyer and Michael Keaton are really just there and they don't do anything special.<br /><br />Angela Robinson directs and she does an okay job. She tries to keep the film interesting but she's working with a weak script. Thomas Lennon and Ben Garant wrote the screenplay and would it be any surprise to you that they were also responsible for Taxi and The Pacifier? These two make light films yet they fail to really make the stories interesting or enjoyable. It's not completely their fault but hopefully next time they will try harder. In the end, Herbie is a safe, predictable family film that's worth watching if you're a kid. Everyone else is better off skipping it.

{"value":"I see that someone already thought of a similar analogy, which was similar to the first thing that came to mind after I watched this movie. They said that the ingredients were there but there was no plot. Besides the sexual scenes which bordered on child-porn (which I feel could have been edited out or been presented more suggestively in nature rather than graphically, I would liken this movie to a recipe that's been torn in half. It's kind of like being handed a list of ingredients, with no directions on how to put them together into a finished product. From the start, character development and story development are lacking...unfortunately, many times in this monotonous drivel we are teased with bits of plot and we think \"Ahh-OK...finally we are going to find out something more about WHY this scene is going on...or...WHO this character is...or maybe we are finally going to get to know and appreciate this character more...or understand and get involved more with this inter-character relationship...etc.\" But no such luck! On the contrary, many times I was tempted to just turn it off more than once but stuck it out when the carrot was dangled, only to find that whatever mini-plot within whatever mini-plot (and that poorly presented) was just a ruse. Why I stayed with it till the end is a mystery, other than usually IFC has better selections and they gave it 2-1/2 stars (another mystery). It's not that the characters aren't likable to SOME degree, or that you can't identify with them or their humanness at all...it's just that this could have been so much better with just a little more effort. I notice this was shot around Santa Cruz and find myself wondering if it was someone's film school project. I wish I could have given this a better review but honestly it was a frustrating and disappointing waste of an hour and a half.","finished_norm":["i","see","that","someon","alreadi","think","of","a","similar","analogi","which","be","similar","to","the","thing","that","come","to","mind","after","i","watch","thi","movi","thei","sai","that","the","ingredi","be","there","but","there","be","no","plot","besid","the","sexual","scene","which","border","on","childporn","which","i","feel","can","have","be","edit","out","or","be","present","much","suggest","in","natur","rather","than","graphic","i","would","liken","thi","movi","to","a","recip","that","be","tear","in","half","it","kind","of","like","be","hand","a","list","of","ingredi","with","no","direct","on","how","to","put","them","togeth","into","a","finish","product","from","the","start","charact","develop","and","stori","develop","be","lackingunfortun","mani","time","in","thi","monoton","drivel","we","be","teas","with","bit","of","plot","and","we","think","ahhokfin","we","be","go","to","find","out","someth","much","about","why","thi","scene","be","go","onorwho","thi","charact","isor","mayb","we","be","final","go","to","get","to","know","and","appreci","thi","charact","moreor","understand","and","get","involv","much","with","thi","intercharact","relationshipetc","but","no","such","luck","on","the","contrari","mani","time","i","be","tempt","to","just","turn","it","off","much","than","onc","but","stick","it","out","when","the","carrot","be","dangl","onli","to","find","that","whatev","miniplot","within","whatev","miniplot","and","that","poorli","present","be","just","a","ruse","why","i","stai","with","it","till","the","end","be","a","mysteri","other","than","usual","ifc","have","well","select","and","thei","give","it","star","anoth","mysteri","it","not","that","the","charact","be","not","likabl","to","some","degre","or","that","you","ca","not","identifi","with","them","or","their","human","at","allit","just","that","thi","can","have","be","so","much","well","with","just","a","littl","much","effort","i","notic","thi","be","shoot","around","santa","cruz","and","find","myself","wonder","if","it","be","someon","film","school","project","i","wish","i","can","have","give","thi","a","well","review","but","honestli","it","be","a","frustrat","and","disappoint","wast","of","a","hour","and","a","half"],"filtered":["see","someon","alreadi","think","similar","analogi","similar","thing","come","mind","watch","thi","movi","thei","sai","ingredi","plot","besid","sexual","scene","border","childporn","feel","edit","present","much","suggest","natur","rather","graphic","liken","thi","movi","recip","tear","half","kind","like","hand","list","ingredi","direct","put","togeth","finish","product","start","charact","develop","stori","develop","lackingunfortun","mani","time","thi","monoton","drivel","teas","bit","plot","think","ahhokfin","go","find","someth","much","thi","scene","go","onorwho","thi","charact","isor","mayb","final","go","get","know","appreci","thi","charact","moreor","understand","get","involv","much","thi","intercharact","relationshipetc","luck","contrari","mani","time","tempt","turn","much","onc","stick","carrot","dangl","onli","find","whatev","miniplot","within","whatev","miniplot","poorli","present","ruse","stai","till","end","mysteri","usual","ifc","well","select","thei","give","star","anoth","mysteri","charact","likabl","degre","ca","identifi","human","allit","thi","much","well","littl","much","effort","notic","thi","shoot","around","santa","cruz","find","wonder","someon","film","school","project","wish","give","thi","well","review","honestli","frustrat","disappoint","wast","hour","half"],"filtered2":["see","someon","alreadi","think","similar","analogi","similar","thing","come","mind","watch","ingredi","plot","besid","sexual","scene","border","childporn","feel","edit","present","suggest","natur","rather","graphic","liken","recip","tear","half","kind","like","hand","list","ingredi","direct","put","togeth","finish","product","start","charact","develop","stori","develop","lackingunfortun","mani","time","monoton","drivel","teas","bit","plot","think","ahhokfin","go","find","someth","scene","go","onorwho","charact","isor","mayb","final","go","get","know","appreci","charact","moreor","understand","get","involv","intercharact","relationshipetc","luck","contrari","mani","time","tempt","turn","onc","stick","carrot","dangl","onli","find","whatev","miniplot","within","whatev","miniplot","poorli","present","ruse","stai","till","end","mysteri","usual","ifc","well","select","give","star","anoth","mysteri","charact","likabl","degre","ca","identifi","human","allit","well","littl","effort","notic","shoot","around","santa","cruz","find","wonder","someon","school","project","wish","give","well","review","honestli","frustrat","disappoint","wast","hour","half"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,7,8,10,11,12,14,17,19,20,24,26,29,30,32,34,38,43,50,53,71,73,81,89,96,98,100,102,117,122,139,156,159,160,163,174,175,176,187,190,206,212,235,236,238,241,265,270,292,296,320,330,348,365,398,399,401,403,411,

{"value":"OK ...I watch a lot of bad movies. I pride myself on that fact. many times there are some gems in the B rated bombs. But this movie is one of the worst I have watched. I like a good horror movie...but one with a plot of and sense of movement. The opening scenes seemed pretty good. Decent music and imagery. Then it goes down hill from there. One of the main characters has a disability (Ringing in the Ears called Tinnitus). Now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret. They made that too much of a focus of the movie. So what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn't have been. No need to keep bringing it up. So this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table. So instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body. Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her. Well after seeing her sister over and over again (as a zombie like ghost) and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her. Now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her. Bad thing is that she didn't have much of a plan. Only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped. The idiot didn't even believe he killed her. So all is revealed there and even though she had a gun....somehow she manages to get herself strangled. So the last scenes of the movie are of the \"spirits\" of her and her twin walking out of the water. So you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins.

{"value":"First of all, I'd like to tell you that I'm into comics, anime, animation and such stuff. It is true that everyone has his own preferences, but you can trust me on this movie. I'll be objective. To begin with the story - it's OK. Follows the story line of the comic books as far as I'm familiar with them. But the animation... Well, it's not actually terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be a lot better if they didn't try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings. If we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more. Looks a little bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for instance - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better! In addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable, the music is nothing special. So all in all - it lacks atmosphere. I watched it, but I cannot tell I really enjoyed it. It just does not capture you. There's plenty of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. May be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?), but I don't think this is the audience for this movie. So they could add a little nudity and spice to it. The chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty, and hell, we have Lady Death herself! There are few sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all - the movie isn't that bad, but if you want something better take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards maybe.

{"value":"I tried watching this abomination of the cinema when I was five years old; I have never been the same since. Filled to the brim with drug-induced images that reek of the common ravings of your average asylum resident, this \"movie\", despite its colorful appearance, is not for humans, ESPECIALLY not children.<br /><br />It starts out innocently enough with a poor boy who ruins his classmate's drum by (wait for it) putting his head through it; yes, putting his HEAD through it. But fear not, my friends! He is quickly consoled by his chirping flute, which is weird enough, I'll grant you, but still acceptable.<br /><br />THEN: The movie morphs into a combination of Wizard of Oz and Where the Wild Things Are, but loses all the \"warm and fuzzy\" aspects of either of these two books.<br /><br />So, this seven-foot yellow relative of Barney, befriends this poor boy and plunges him even deeper into despair.<br /><br />And, to add the pleasant array of horrific themes, a carnivorous boat, formerly a friend of the motley crew of hobbling grandfather clocks and doped-up \"dragons\", is added to the mix of mayhem.<br /><br />The most comforting image in the midst of this chaos is the villain, aptly dubbed \"Witchiepoo\" (?). Of course, she has problems of her own: what with an obvious plastic mask constricting her facial expressions to having to deal with a broomstick whose gas level always seemed to be at its lowest at the most inopportune moments. As a result of this, one of her favorite pastimes was nose-diving into the body of water that separated the land of Pufnstuf from her degenerate, decaying abode (I don't know where I would have preferred to live).<br /><br />In summary, this movie is terrifying...<br /><br />If you want to watch the movie that has similar effects on its audience as The Exorcist, then this one is for you.

{"value":"The name \"cult movie\" is often given to films which continue to be screened, or to sell in home movie format, more than a generation after they were first released. Superchick, which was first released in 1973, now comes into this category. Its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film.<br /><br />Despite the \"Superwoman\" connotation, \"Superchick\" is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess - a career option which in the 1970's was commonly regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl, and which also enables her to emulate the traditional matelot who reputedly has a wife in every port. Since she holds black belt status in karate, she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence, and is in no way beholden to any of her extensive suite of male admirers. This film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce. Its appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avert a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate. To ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners, the Director has wisely ensured that is liberally sprinkled with eye candy.<br /><br />Superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing. It is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a year's time; despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come. However the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than 4/10.","finished_norm":["the","name","cult","movi","be","often","give","to","film","which","continu","to","be","screen","or","to","sell","in","home","movi","format","much","than","a","gener","after","thei","be","releas","superchick","which","be","releas","in","now","come","into","thi","categori","it","cult","statu","be","larg","due","to","ongo","interest","in","it","by","that","woman","who","regard","it","a","a","earli","and","effect","feminist","filmbr","br","despit","the","superwoman","connot","superchick","be","not","a","cartoon","charact","but","a","veri","compet","young","ladi","work","a","a","air","stewardess","a","career","option","which","in","the","be","commonli","regard","a","on","of","the","much","glamor","open","to","ani","girl","and","which","conjur","enabl","her","to","emul","the","tradit","matelot","who","reputedli","have","a","wife","in","everi","port","sinc","she","hold","black","belt","statu","in","karat","she","be","in","a","posit","to","make","it","quit","clear","that","she","be","veri","happi","with","her","bachelor","exist","and","be","in","no","wai","beholden","to","ani","of","her","extens","suit","of","male","admir","thi","film","be","a","situat","comedi","which","avoid","the","gener","much","short","live","appeal","of","outright","farc","it","appeal","to","feminist","be","conjur","heighten","by","a","climax","in","which","our","heroin","us","her","karat","abil","to","avert","a","hijack","and","save","all","the","other","passeng","on","her","plane","from","a","potenti","unpleas","fate","to","ensur","that","thi","film","will","appeal","to","man","a","good","a","to","their","partner","the","director","have","wise","ensur","that","be","liber","sprinkl","with","ey","candybr","br","superchick","can","be","enjoi","by","that","who","be","not","too","critic","and","want","a","veri","light","easi","to","watch","comedi","which","thei","will","forget","soon","after","view","it","be","so","forgett","that","thei","will","probabl","find","it","equal","enjoy","if","watch","again","in","a","year","time","despit","it","ag","it","mai","therefor","retain","it","statu","a","a","cult","movi","for","some","time","to","come","howev","the","dialogu","and","act","would","make","it","hard","to","give","thi","film","a","rate","of","much","than"],"filtered":["name","cult","movi","often","give","film","continu","screen","sell","home","movi","format","much","gener","thei","releas","superchick","releas","come","thi","categori","cult","statu","larg","due","ongo","interest","woman","regard","earli","effect","feminist","filmbr","br","despit","superwoman","connot","superchick","cartoon","charact","veri","compet","young","ladi","work","air","stewardess","career","option","commonli","regard","much","glamor","open","ani","girl","conjur","enabl","emul","tradit","matelot","reputedli","wife","everi","port","sinc","hold","black","belt","statu","karat","posit","make","quit","clear","veri","happi","bachelor","exist","wai","beholden","ani","extens","suit","male","admir","thi","film","situat","comedi","avoid","gener","much","short","live","appeal","outright","farc","appeal","feminist","conjur","heighten","climax","heroin","us","karat","abil","avert","hijack","save","passeng","plane","potenti","unpleas","fate","ensur","thi","film","appeal","man","good","partner","director","wise","ensur","liber","sprinkl","ey","candybr","br","superchick","enjoi","critic","want","veri","light","easi","watch","comedi","thei","forget","soon","view","forgett","thei","probabl","find","equal","enjoy","watch","year","time","despit","ag","mai","therefor","retain","statu","cult","movi","time","come","howev","dialogu","act","make","hard","give","thi","film","rate","much"],"filtered2":["name","cult","often","give","continu","screen","sell","home","format","gener","releas","superchick","releas","come","categori","cult","statu","larg","due","ongo","interest","woman","regard","earli","effect","feminist","filmbr","despit","superwoman","connot","superchick","cartoon","charact","veri","compet","young","ladi","work","air","stewardess","career","option","commonli","regard","glamor","open","ani","girl","conjur","enabl","emul","tradit","matelot","reputedli","wife","everi","port","sinc","hold","black","belt","statu","karat","posit","make","quit","clear","veri","happi","bachelor","exist","wai","beholden","ani","extens","suit","male","admir","situat","comedi","avoid","gener","short","live","appeal","outright","farc","appeal","feminist","conjur","heighten","climax","heroin","us","karat","abil","avert","hijack","save","passeng","plane","potenti","unpleas","fate","ensur","appeal","man","good","partner","director","wise","ensur","liber","sprinkl","ey","candybr","superchick","enjoi","critic","want","veri","light","easi","watch","comedi","forget","soon","view","forgett","probabl","find","equal","enjoy","watch","year","time","despit","ag","mai","therefor","retain","statu","cult","time","come","howev","dialogu","act","make","hard","give","rate"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625

{"value":"As someone who has both read the novel and seen the film, I have a different take on why the film was such a flop. First, any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial. They are two different animals.<br /><br />The novel is probably intended as a satire, but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead. Any comedic elements such as those which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the author's uniformly cynical thrust. And lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another Mark Twain, think again. A more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of Ambrose Bierce in a top hat and tails. Tom Wolfe is equal parts clown and hack, more celebrity than author, always looking for new grist for his self-absorbed mill. <br /><br />It is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start. Unlike true satire, which translates very well into film, polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior, but in a single-minded attack on specific people -- whether real or fictional straw men -- who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer. Any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start, free of the writer's influence or interference.<br /><br />Having said that, I too find fault with the casting. It is not merely that incompetents like Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith fail to measure up, but that real talents like Tom Hanks, F. Murray Abraham, and Morgan Freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures.<br /><br />There is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire, but it fails to

{"value":"I went into this with my hopes up, by twenty minutes into the movie I couldn't have been more let down. Despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake, I kept my hopes high that maybe...just maybe someone would get it right this time around. Sadly, Prom Night is about on the same quality level as the recent April Fools Day remake, bad script, bad direction, cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror.<br /><br />From beginning to end it's boring, repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls. We've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better then this. If you go to see Prom Night in the theater (I'd say wait for the DVD or PPV), get ready for the audience to laugh, because laugh they will. The laughs aren't at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny, they are in response to key \"thrilling\" moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of Scary Movie. Seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof? The film makers missed the mark so badly here, that a large number of the audience in the theater I attended walked out about halfway through the movie. Which in retrospect, I wish I had done. Not me though, I had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better. Needless to say It didn't. The \"horror\" scenes are a joke, not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction, the script, the \"special effects\" and the camera work. The movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it, but still came out of it with a micro budget movie. I halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking I would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere. <br /><br />This movies scary alright, if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is

{"value":"Though not a fan of Sam Rockwell, I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits in the opening of 'Joshua.' Heck, I wasn't even aware he was in 'Joshua' until I started the movie. So it goes without saying, I was watching the movie on the basis of the movie, not the leads. A sort of 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'The Omen' or any other demonic kid movie 'Joshua' was billed. Unfortunately, it fell flat. Slow, incredibly slow, and flat. Yet, I continued on to see how this would all resolve, hoping beyond belief, the ending climax would shed some light on the subject. Okay, I admit, it did (a wee bit) but what a stale closing. And what a low-low budget movie, or at least that's how they designed it. A person falls  you don't see the drop, you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood. A person gets hit by a cab  you don't see it, you see someone complaining, holding a bike up. I'm not sure if this is called \"style\" or laziness or simply, lack of funds for special effects. We have a \"rich\" family with a crazy mom, a workaholic father attempting to balance everything, a kid  Joshua, who may/may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot. She cries as much as we see how many days she's alive  and what was that about? Are there rats above or is it Joshua? Is his mother nuts? Is Joshua crazy? Is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family? Is he going to grow up to be Michael Myers? Or does he drive his family to the brink? I don't think so. They were nuts prior, and no \"so-called\" acting could make me believe otherwise. Unfortunately, barely any questions were answered, barely any open doors shut. I'm sure that might have been the idea, but for Pete's sake, give me something. Anything. There are plenty better kid-gone-wild movies to explore.

{"value":"Randall \"Memphis\" Raines is a retired master car thief who is forced back into the \"game\" when his younger brother faces death for not filling an order for British crime boss Raymond Calitri. The job involves \"lifting\" 50 cars in 24 hours or Calitri will enact his punishment. So Raines quickly assembles a crew he can trust and sets about the task to hand. But the police are on to him and some of the cars on the list are not easy takes. It would seem a near impossible job to complete.<br /><br />It's got quite a cast has Gone In 60 Seconds, Nicolas Cage, Angelina Jolie, Robert Duvall, Will Patton, Delroy Lindo, Vinnie Jones, Giovanni Ribisi, Christopher Ecclestone, Scott Caan & Timothy Olyphant. All of whom deserve better. Enough acting horsepower there to propel a Porsche 998 Turbo. Trouble is, is that this is very much a case of too many cars overstocking the car park, mucho characters, not enough zest. From the off we are in no doubt that this is a Bruckheimer/Simpson production, bonkers script laced with loud noises and lashings of cheese, scattergun editing, and directed with sledgehammer subtly by Dominic Sena. It's essentially a big budget remake of H.B. Halicki's 1974 indie movie of the same name, with the premise offering up the potential for an adrenalin fuelled car based movie. Potential that sadly is never realised. There's one or two high impact moments, daft for sure, but enjoyable none the less. But if you pardon the pun, the film never gets out of first gear, it's more content to labour with its ream of characters who mope about trying to make the boorish screenplay {Scott Rosenberg} work.<br /><br />Car fans will get something from it {the cars are ace on the eye}, as will fans of unintentional comedy movies {check out Ecclestone's carpenter grief moment}. But no, it's really rather poor all told.

{"value":"Ron Howard directed this? The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is movie magic. Much like Danny Devito's Penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates. Where the 1966 cartoon featured a Grinch that we could all identify with, Carrey's Grinch is that angry, soulless old man that we've all seen at one time or another, sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane. This Grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity, humor, or insight whatsoever, and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false. The whole movie rings false: there is some stupid Christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt at explaining why the Grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood, and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the Whos have that weird lip extension and some of them don't. Contrary to the 1966 cartoon, I would imagine children would find this movie tiresome, irritating, and filled with contradictory messages. Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives. Throw in the requisite butt jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes, and other obligatory Carreyesque low-brow humor, and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon (or book that inspired it) as George W.

{"value":"or anyone who was praying for the sight of Al Cliver wrestling a naked, 7ft tall black guy into a full nelson, your film has arrived! Film starlet Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner) is kidnapped by a group who demand the ransom of $6 million to be delivered to their island hideaway. What they don't count on is rugged Vietnam vet Peter Weston (Cliver) being hired by a film producer to save the girl. And what they really didn't count on was a local tribe that likes to offer up young women to their monster cannibal god with bloodshot bug eyes.<br /><br />Pretty much the same filming set up as CANNIBALS, this one fares a bit better when it comes to entertainment value, thanks mostly a hilarious dub track and the impossibly goofy monster with the bulging eyes (Franco confirms they were split ping pong balls on the disc's interview). Franco gets a strong EuroCult supporting cast including Gisela Hahn (CONTAMINATION) and Werner Pochath (whose death is one of the most head-scratching things I ever seen as a guy who is totally not him is shown - in close up - trying to be him). The film features tons of nudity and the gore (Tempra paint variety) is there. The highlight for me was the world's slowly fistfight between Cliver and Antonio de Cabo in the splashing waves. Sadly, ol' Jess pads this one out to an astonishing (and, at times, agonizing) 1 hour and 40 minutes when it should have run 80 minutes tops. <br /><br />For the most part, the Severin DVD looks pretty nice but there are some odd ghosting images going on during some of the darker scenes. Also, one long section of dialog is in Spanish with no subs (they are an option, but only when you listen to the French track). Franco gives a nice 16- minute interview about the film and has much more pleasant things to say about Buchfellner than his CANNIBALS star Sabrina

{"value":"If I write a review about a movie, maybe it will stick with me... but generally I expect that I will have forgotten I've seen this one a mere two weeks from now. So why bother? Because again I find myself watching a low-rated movie that was fun to watch. I didn't expect I'd to be able to stay in the room while it was on.<br /><br />It wasn't great, but at least it was not unbearable... not a comedy of errors which always makes me cringe. It was just sweet fluff... and if you can't take it, stay in the locker room boys. I agree with those who defend this movie because it is sure to please its targeted demographic, and won't be a total bore to an adult.<br /><br />It offers a few good chuckles here and there, but nary a side splitter. Sure it is silly and only mildly entertaining, but at least it doesn't suck (as so many have said it does). Maybe those folks are afraid of their sensitive sides? <br /><br />I have a tendency to grade on the bell curve, so a 4,5 or 6 is actually an okay all-around rating in my book. Giving it a 4 makes sense and will bolster its rating at the time of this writing. Giving it a 1 or a 10, as most have done thus far, makes the rating numbers meaningless. I cannot believe how strongly people feel one way or the other about this forgettable fluff (or that I am even bothering to write about it). Am I missing something? <br /><br />Anyway, it should be noted that Emma Roberts performs her role as Clairedycat quite convincingly. Ariell Kebbel often written into b*ch roles does not disappoint when her character gets her due. You might also recognize Bruce Spence playing Leonard, though his role is ancillary.<br /><br />Surely you can miss this one if you are an adult. But, if there is a pre-teen girl in your life, rent this movie for her... and be prepared NOT to hate it (you might even enjoy it).","finished_norm":["if","i","write","a","review","about","a","movi","mayb","it","will","stick","with","me","but","gener","i","expect","that","i","will","have","forget","i","have","see","thi","on","a","mere","two","week","from","now","so","why","bother","becaus","again","i","find","myself","watch","a","lowrat","movi","that","be","fun","to","watch","i","do","not","expect","i","have","to","be","abl","to","stai","in","the","room","while","it","be","onbr","br","it","be","not","great","but","at","littl","it","be","not","unbear","not","a","comedi","of","error","which","alwai","make","me","cring","it","be","just","sweet","fluff","and","if","you","ca","not","take","it","stai","in","the","locker","room","boi","i","agre","with","that","who","defend","thi","movi","becaus","it","be","sure","to","pleas","it","target","demograph","and","wo","not","be","a","total","bear","to","a","adultbr","br","it","offer","a","few","good","chuckl","here","and","there","but","nari","a","side","splitter","sure","it","be","silli","and","onli","mildli","entertain","but","at","littl","it","doe","not","suck","a","so","mani","have","sai","it","doe","mayb","that","folk","be","afraid","of","their","sensit","side","br","br","i","have","a","tendenc","to","grade","on","the","bell","curv","so","a","or","be","actual","a","okai","allaround","rate","in","my","book","give","it","a","make","sens","and","will","bolster","it","rate","at","the","time","of","thi","write","give","it","a","or","a","a","much","have","do","thu","far","make","the","rate","number","meaningless","i","cannot","believ","how","strongli","peopl","feel","on","wai","or","the","other","about","thi","forgett","fluff","or","that","i","be","even","bother","to","write","about","it","be","i","miss","someth","br","br","anywai","it","should","be","note","that","emma","robert","perform","her","role","a","clairedycat","quit","convincingli","ariel","kebbel","often","write","into","bch","role","doe","not","disappoint","when","her","charact","get","her","due","you","mai","conjur","recogn","bruce","spenc","plai","leonard","though","hi","role","be","ancillarybr","br","sure","you","can","miss","thi","on","if","you","be","a","adult","but","if","there","be","a","preteen","girl","in","your","life","rend","thi","movi","for","her","and","be","prepar","not","to","hate","it","you","mai","even","enjoi","it"],"filtered":["write","review","movi","mayb","stick","gener","expect","forget","see","thi","mere","two","week","bother","becaus","find","watch","lowrat","movi","fun","watch","expect","abl","stai","room","onbr","br","great","littl","unbear","comedi","error","alwai","make","cring","sweet","fluff","ca","take","stai","locker","room","boi","agre","defend","thi","movi","becaus","sure","pleas","target","demograph","wo","total","bear","adultbr","br","offer","good","chuckl","nari","side","splitter","sure","silli","onli","mildli","entertain","littl","doe","suck","mani","sai","doe","mayb","folk","afraid","sensit","side","br","br","tendenc","grade","bell","curv","actual","okai","allaround","rate","book","give","make","sens","bolster","rate","time","thi","write","give","much","thu","far","make","rate","number","meaningless","believ","strongli","peopl","feel","wai","thi","forgett","fluff","even","bother","write","miss","someth","br","br","anywai","note","emma","robert","perform","role","clairedycat","quit","convincingli","ariel","kebbel","often","write","bch","role","doe","disappoint","charact","get","due","mai","conjur","recogn","bruce","spenc","plai","leonard","though","hi","role","ancillarybr","br","sure","miss","thi","adult","preteen","girl","life","rend","thi","movi","prepar","hate","mai","even","enjoi"],"filtered2":["write","review","mayb","stick","gener","expect","forget","see","mere","two","week","bother","becaus","find","watch","lowrat","fun","watch","expect","abl","stai","room","onbr","great","littl","unbear","comedi","error","alwai","make","cring","sweet","fluff","ca","take","stai","locker","room","boi","agre","defend","becaus","sure","pleas","target","demograph","wo","total","bear","adultbr","offer","good","chuckl","nari","side","splitter","sure","silli","onli","mildli","entertain","littl","doe","suck","mani","doe","mayb","folk","afraid","sensit","side","tendenc","grade","bell","curv","actual","okai","allaround","rate","book","give","make","sens","bolster","rate","time","write","give","thu","far","make","rate","number","meaningless","believ","strongli","peopl","feel","wai","forgett","fluff","even","bother","write","miss","someth","anywai","note","emma","robert","perform","role","clairedycat","quit","convincingli","ariel","kebbel","often","write","bch","role","doe","disappoint","charact","get","due","mai","conjur","recogn","bruce","spenc","plai","leonard","though","role","ancillarybr","sure","miss","adult","preteen","girl","life","rend","prepar","hate","mai","even","enjoi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,7,8,10,11,14,18,22,23,30,31,33,38,39,40,43,46,47,50,51,52,53,65,75,81,84,86,91,101,

{"value":"Before seeing this movie, I was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book; instead, it's the book, interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different \"illnesses.\" That didn't bother me much, but it hindered my enjoyment of the film. One story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable, in my opinion. If you're going to base a movie on a psychology text, you've got to find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text than this one. The film drags during parts where it's little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it weren't sexual in nature (because \"sex = interesting\" for most of us, even me). Luckily, there are several stories with actual character development that pull us in.<br /><br />But, disappointingly, Krafft-Ebing's theories of sexuality went unchallenged, for the most part. I was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this day.<br /><br />So, in the end, what do you have? A detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations, with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few \"sexual deviants\" before they are cured. For most of the film, the film moves with the crawling speed (and mood) of a wake. And, as an obviously low budget film, the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier. Although I *was* pleased with the music, costume and interior design.<br /><br />I felt this film's subject was right up my alley, and I still feel it's a below average film. It deserves a 3/10; a 4/10 if I were feeling extremely generous. I can't imagine anyone enjoying this if they didn't already have an interest in sexual fetishism.","finished_norm":["befor","see","thi","movi","i","be","expect","a","fiction","drama","base","loos","on","idea","from","the","book","instead","it","the","book","interrupt","with","dramat","scene","illustr","the","differ","ill","that","do","not","bother","me","much","but","it","hinder","my","enjoy","of","the","film","on","stori","or","even","two","or","three","long","stori","with","excerpt","from","the","book","interspers","through","the","movi","would","have","be","prefer","in","my","opinion","if","you","re","go","to","base","a","movi","on","a","psychologi","text","you","have","get","to","find","a","much","interest","and","prefer","accur","text","than","thi","on","the","film","drag","dure","part","where","it","littl","much","than","a","video","encyclopedia","of","th","centuri","sexual","psychologi","and","would","be","utterli","intoler","if","it","be","not","sexual","in","natur","becaus","sex","interest","for","much","of","u","even","me","luckili","there","be","sever","stori","with","actual","charact","develop","that","pull","u","inbr","br","but","disappointingli","kraffteb","theori","of","sexual","go","unchalleng","for","the","much","part","i","be","hope","it","would","us","stori","to","show","how","the","imperfect","of","hi","archaic","view","of","psychologi","which","be","still","hold","by","mani","to","thi","daybr","br","so","in","the","end","what","do","you","have","a","detail","catalog","of","a","few","fetish","and","orient","with","some","mildli","interest","stori","show","the","trial","and","tribul","of","a","few","sexual","deviant","befor","thei","be","cure","for","much","of","the","film","the","film","move","with","the","crawl","spe","and","mood","of","a","wake","and","a","a","obvious","low","budget","film","the","cinematographi","and","act","be","not","exactli","top","tier","although","i","be","pleas","with","the","music","costum","and","interior","designbr","br","i","feel","thi","film","subject","be","right","up","my","allei","and","i","still","feel","it","a","below","averag","film","it","deserv","a","a","if","i","be","feel","extrem","gener","i","ca","not","imagin","anyon","enjoi","thi","if","thei","do","not","alreadi","have","a","interest","in","sexual","fetish"],"filtered":["befor","see","thi","movi","expect","fiction","drama","base","loos","idea","book","instead","book","interrupt","dramat","scene","illustr","differ","ill","bother","much","hinder","enjoy","film","stori","even","two","three","long","stori","excerpt","book","interspers","movi","prefer","opinion","re","go","base","movi","psychologi","text","get","find","much","interest","prefer","accur","text","thi","film","drag","dure","part","littl","much","video","encyclopedia","th","centuri","sexual","psychologi","utterli","intoler","sexual","natur","becaus","sex","interest","much","u","even","luckili","sever","stori","actual","charact","develop","pull","u","inbr","br","disappointingli","kraffteb","theori","sexual","go","unchalleng","much","part","hope","us","stori","show","imperfect","hi","archaic","view","psychologi","still","hold","mani","thi","daybr","br","end","detail","catalog","fetish","orient","mildli","interest","stori","show","trial","tribul","sexual","deviant","befor","thei","cure","much","film","film","move","crawl","spe","mood","wake","obvious","low","budget","film","cinematographi","act","exactli","top","tier","although","pleas","music","costum","interior","designbr","br","feel","thi","film","subject","right","allei","still","feel","averag","film","deserv","feel","extrem","gener","ca","imagin","anyon","enjoi","thi","thei","alreadi","interest","sexual","fetish"],"filtered2":["befor","see","expect","fiction","drama","base","loos","idea","book","instead","book","interrupt","dramat","scene","illustr","differ","ill","bother","hinder","enjoy","stori","even","two","three","long","stori","excerpt","book","interspers","prefer","opinion","re","go","base","psychologi","text","get","find","interest","prefer","accur","text","drag","dure","part","littl","video","encyclopedia","th","centuri","sexual","psychologi","utterli","intoler","sexual","natur","becaus","sex","interest","u","even","luckili","sever","stori","actual","charact","develop","pull","u","inbr","disappointingli","kraffteb","theori","sexual","go","unchalleng","part","hope","us","stori","show","imperfect","archaic","view","psychologi","still","hold","mani","daybr","end","detail","catalog","fetish","orient","mildli","interest","stori","show","trial","tribul","sexual","deviant","befor","cure","move","crawl","spe","mood","wake","obvious","low","budget","cinematographi","act","exactli","top","tier","although","pleas","music","costum","interior","designbr","feel","subject","right","allei","still","feel","averag","deserv","feel","extrem","gener","ca","imagin","anyon","enjoi","alreadi","interest","sexual","fetish"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,6,10,14,17,19,21,22,24,28,38,43,47,50,52,56,60,61,64,68,79,81,99,112,118,121,123,130,151,152,158,181,200,204,217,224

{"value":"This engaging (which it shouldn't be) low-grade Spanish exploitation (quite tame I might add) looks good, but huh? Let me phrase that again 'huh?'. Actually the word 'huh?' would be going through your mind quite a lot. Nothing makes sense, nor does it try too. I just don't know if its complicatedly cryptic or just a convoluted muddle, but there's no denying how laconically uneventful, strange and wordy it feels.<br /><br />Unrelated sequences tied (like that nasty opening involving a little girl, dead cat and fire) in to a sparse story involving photographer Mario (played by a chest-puffing John Caffari, who's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo's iconic Mario. What's the odds?) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady (a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment, where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches.<br /><br />Look past the unhinged plot structure and wallow in what is simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms and growing unease. Raul Artigot directs few jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages, but for most part seems sporadically non-existent and unfocused just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away. However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and overwrought score blends terrifically with compulsively dense atmosphere created. The leads are capable, but there's also a sturdy bunch (the pick being Víctor Israel) of secondary performances.<br /><br />Slow with little in the way of interest, but this dreamy set-up (that seems

{"value":"One could wish that an idea as good as the \"invisible man\" would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects, but this is not the case. The story, the characters and, finally the entire last 20 minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad-scientist flick from the early 50's. There are some great moments, mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets. But alas, soon we're back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab, which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable, but schematic.<br /><br />There has been a great many remakes of old films or TV shows over the past 10 years, and some of them have their charms. But it's becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol' classics under the noses of eager madmen like Verhoeven (who does have his moments) is a very bad one. It is obvious that the money is the key issue here: the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough, and as a result, \"Hollow Man\" is seriously undermined with clichés, sappy characters, predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever.<br /><br />However, the one thing that actually impressed me, beside the special effects, was the swearing. When making this kind of film, modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them. Therefore, the language (and, sometimes, the violence and sex) is very toned down. When the whole world blows up, the good guys go \"Oh darn!\" and \"Oh my God\". \"Hollow Man\" gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them. I'm not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear - but it makes it more believable if SOMEONE actually swears.

{"value":"First of all sorry for giving even a rating of 1 to this movie (nothing less than this available). The film fails in every department be it screenplay, direction, characterization or acting. <br /><br />1) To start with, the name of the movie is really C class (though the movie itself match up to the name). 2) Amitabh Bachchan tries his best to live up to the character but the weak script coupled with pathetic direction ends up making him a humorous character. 3) In Sholay Gabbar Singh has reward of 50,000 on him (which was convincing). Here in Aag the figure was 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan but poor man was beaten by our so called hero's and had only few men bikes to commute (with all automatic guns). Making a Sholay like movie in Mumbai type setup in modern time doesn't look convincing. 4) As for Nisha Kothari, somebody needs to tell her that she doesn't know acting. Why is Ram Gopal Verma casting her again and again ? 5) Mohanlal was good but there is hardly anything for him to do. 6) Sushant Singh and Rajpal Yadav who are great actors are wasted in the movie. 7) Legendry role played by Lila Misra (Mausi of Basanti) in Sholay is replaced cheaply in this movie by some Gangu Mummy. Ramu please grow up and understand that there needs to be some intellect in your movie. Enough of stupid characters in your movie like Shiva and Aag. 8) Should not say anything about modern Jai and Veeru..pathetic to the greatest extent.<br /><br />To summarize, I was shocked to see this movie because it looks like a cheap and comic translation of original classic. Please don't waste money and time on this movie. I think watching Aap Ka Surror (which I thought was the worst movie possible) would be a better idea than to see this horrible package of stupid characters, bad songs and miserable direction.<br /><br

{"value":"OK, as everyone has pointed out, this film is a complete dog. To some degree this is because it was a gory sexploitation film that had a lot of material excised (or darkened down to near invisibility) to escape the censor's X-rating; but the film has many other flaws as well.<br /><br />To begin with, the scriptwriter seems to have got his werewolves and vampires mixed up. The baddies in this film are furry and don't like silver but in every other respect they behave like vampires. Now you just can't do that with a crappy genre flick, you've got to stick to the rules of the genre or the fans get all confused and annoyed by suspending disbelief in the wrong thing. In fact the whole (confusing and poorly presented) plot is something that has already been done for vampires, but doesn't make any sense in a werewolf movie.<br /><br />Secondly, the werewolf costumes are the lamest you have ever seen. Anybody in the werewolf movie business ought to know that the werewolf costumes and transformations are something the fans assess critically, yet some of these werewolves are just plain goofy.<br /><br />There are a couple of slightly good bits. I actually quite liked the score. Others have mentioned Sybil Danning's tits. And...<br /><br />(***SPOILER***, if such a thing can exist)<br /><br />I also quite liked the plan for attacking the werewolves' stronghold. There are so many horror movies that rely on characters behaving stupidly, but in this case they first acquire a very sensible and effective anti-werewolf arsenal and go slaughter the monsters. I mean, you can kill werewolves with silver bullets, and we have some pretty powerful firearms these days. Shouldn't be too hard to put two and two together, hmm? But in typical style this movie goes over the top and adds some other very zany and amusing anti-lycanthrope weapons.","finished_norm":["okai","a","everyon","have","point","out","thi","film","be","a","complet","dog","to","some","degre","thi","be","becaus","it","be","a","gori","sexploit","film","that","have","a","lot","of","materi","excis","or","darken","down","to","near","invis","to","escap","the","censor","xrate","but","the","film","have","mani","other","flaw","a","wellbr","br","to","begin","with","the","scriptwrit","seem","to","have","get","hi","werewolf","and","vampir","mix","up","the","baddi","in","thi","film","be","furri","and","do","not","like","silver","but","in","everi","other","respect","thei","behav","like","vampir","now","you","just","ca","not","do","that","with","a","crappi","genr","flick","you","have","get","to","stick","to","the","rule","of","the","genr","or","the","fan","get","all","confus","and","annoi","by","suspend","disbelief","in","the","wrong","thing","in","fact","the","whole","confus","and","poorli","present","plot","be","someth","that","have","alreadi","be","do","for","vampir","but","doe","not","make","ani","sens","in","a","werewolf","moviebr","br","secondli","the","werewolf","costum","be","the","lame","you","have","ever","see","anybodi","in","the","werewolf","movi","busi","ought","to","know","that","the","werewolf","costum","and","transform","be","someth","the","fan","assess","critic","yet","some","of","thi","werewolf","be","just","plain","goofybr","br","there","be","a","coupl","of","slightli","good","bit","i","actual","quit","like","the","score","other","have","mention","sybil","dan","tit","andbr","br","spoiler","if","such","a","thing","can","existbr","br","i","conjur","quit","like","the","plan","for","attack","the","werewolf","stronghold","there","be","so","mani","horror","movi","that","reli","on","charact","behav","stupidli","but","in","thi","case","thei","acquir","a","veri","sensibl","and","effect","antiwerewolf","arsen","and","go","slaughter","the","monster","i","mean","you","can","kill","werewolf","with","silver","bullet","and","we","have","some","pretti","power","firearm","thi","dai","should","not","be","too","hard","to","put","two","and","two","togeth","hmm","but","in","typic","styl","thi","movi","go","over","the","top","and","add","some","other","veri","zani","and","amus","antilycanthrop","weapon"],"filtered":["okai","everyon","point","thi","film","complet","dog","degre","thi","becaus","gori","sexploit","film","lot","materi","excis","darken","near","invis","escap","censor","xrate","film","mani","flaw","wellbr","br","begin","scriptwrit","seem","get","hi","werewolf","vampir","mix","baddi","thi","film","furri","like","silver","everi","respect","thei","behav","like","vampir","ca","crappi","genr","flick","get","stick","rule","genr","fan","get","confus","annoi","suspend","disbelief","wrong","thing","fact","whole","confus","poorli","present","plot","someth","alreadi","vampir","doe","make","ani","sens","werewolf","moviebr","br","secondli","werewolf","costum","lame","ever","see","anybodi","werewolf","movi","busi","know","werewolf","costum","transform","someth","fan","assess","critic","yet","thi","werewolf","plain","goofybr","br","coupl","slightli","good","bit","actual","quit","like","score","mention","sybil","dan","tit","andbr","br","spoiler","thing","existbr","br","conjur","quit","like","plan","attack","werewolf","stronghold","mani","horror","movi","reli","charact","behav","stupidli","thi","case","thei","acquir","veri","sensibl","effect","antiwerewolf","arsen","go","slaughter","monster","mean","kill","werewolf","silver","bullet","pretti","power","firearm","thi","dai","hard","put","two","two","togeth","hmm","typic","styl","thi","movi","go","top","add","veri","zani","amus","antilycanthrop","weapon"],"filtered2":["okai","everyon","point","complet","dog","degre","becaus","gori","sexploit","lot","materi","excis","darken","near","invis","escap","censor","xrate","mani","flaw","wellbr","begin","scriptwrit","seem","get","werewolf","vampir","mix","baddi","furri","like","silver","everi","respect","behav","like","vampir","ca","crappi","genr","flick","get","stick","rule","genr","fan","get","confus","annoi","suspend","disbelief","wrong","thing","fact","whole","confus","poorli","present","plot","someth","alreadi","vampir","doe","make","ani","sens","werewolf","moviebr","secondli","werewolf","costum","lame","ever","see","anybodi","werewolf","busi","know","werewolf","costum","transform","someth","fan","assess","critic","yet","werewolf","plain","goofybr","coupl","slightli","good","bit","actual","quit","like","score","mention","sybil","dan","tit","andbr","spoiler","thing","existbr","conjur","quit","like","plan","attack","werewolf","stronghold","mani","horror","reli","charact","behav","stupidli","case","acquir","veri","sensibl","effect","antiwerewolf","arsen","go","slaughter","monster","mean","kill","werewolf","silver","bullet","pretti","power","firearm","dai","hard","put","two","two","togeth","hmm","typic","styl","go","top","add","veri","zani","amus","antilycanthrop","weapon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625

{"value":"he was my hero for all time until he went along with {if you can call it a movie} I went to the show to watch it and come out and not just asking for me money back but asked for double the money thats how bad my hero's acting and the hole thing was.............I can't believe that Steven Segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors. I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does. When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong.<br /><br />The plot is unbelievable as a movie, and even if you excuse the visuals, and had read this story as a novel, you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book.<br /><br />Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all.<br /><br />I hate to repeat other peoples comments, but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic. The condition of those scenes chopped in, is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner.<br /><br />My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie, it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds. I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget (Segal being paid 5 of that) and that the movie still came in under budget. I must concur.<br /><br />It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie, as no conscientious theater owner would play this movie

{"value":"'P' (or Club-P) should really be called 'L' for lame. Every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much-hyped logline: \"Thai lesbians fighting monsters.\" Rather, this is the tale of a Khmer country girl who's grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd (but specific) rules: \"don't walk under a clothesline,\" \"don't eat raw meat,\" and \"don't accept money for your powers.\" Well, guess what folks, the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a 'bar-girl' and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the 'foreign johns' who pay for her services.<br /><br />While this film can't even be released in Thailand due to it's controversial subject matter most American audiences will find this ho-hum horror pic a cross between \"Showgirls\" and \"Interview with the Vampire\" as directed by Walt Disney.<br /><br />If not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the MPAA could probably rate this for pre-teens only. There is literally broadcast TV adult fare, although you'd expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life.<br /><br />As for the 'lesbian' angle, there's one brief smooch and a couple of \"I love you's\" to prove that the two main stars really are a couple (on brother). And the P-bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts (there's a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl's mouth ... ooh, phallic imagery).<br /><br />NO nudity, NO real monster (unless you count a five foot high Thai spirit with yellow eyes), and no way any ADULT should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD.

{"value":"Well to answer one persons's question of \"why doesn't anyone remember this film?\" it's because really,not that many people saw it in 1978 and it's not been shown much on TV since. (If it's on video that'd be news to me!) Even in the era of sometimes mindless comedies that was the '70s,movie-goers had the smarts to avoid this film. Unless they love Billy Crytal,Paul Lynde or Joan Rivers \"that\" much! <br /><br />Paul Lynde was funnier on \"Bewitched\" or \"Hollywood Squares\" than here. Joan Rivers at this time in her career was getting laughs making cruel jokes about singer Karen Carpenter's lack of weight! Har-har Joan! It also seems like every \"somewhat\" famous name from the era is in the cast. (Most surprising is Doris Roberts later of \"Everybody Loves Raymond\".)<br /><br />Anyhow,a somewhat good idea for a storyline,a man getting pregnant instead of the woman goes to waste here. With help from a male friend Crystal gets set up with a hooker to finally lose his virginity but because she was \"on top\" instead of him,he gets pregnant! (A commentary on women taking positions of power away from men).<br /><br />Crystal's stomach grows,he goes through all the female emotions and related feelings. Unfortunately,he is now a socially misunderstood outcast! He's attacked by a mob who wants him rubbed out (I guess).<br /><br />He's forced to go into seclusion to have his baby...in a barn. Or if you will,a manger (God only knows where it may have exited from! Ewwww!) It turns out (no shock here) to be a girl! <br /><br />Everything else about this movie is worthless and forgettable,the humor is high school level or less.<br /><br />2 stars for a good idea and a few good touching & relevant moments w/ Billy Crystal. Ignore the rest of Rabitt Test,it flunks big time!<br /><br />I can't believe Roddy McDowell signed on either!

{"value":"I've seen my share of Woody Allen's movies, and while they're not always great, you can usually be sure you're going to be entertained. Probably the last really good ones were Bullets Over Broadway ('94) and Mighty Aphrodite ('95) - since then the ones I've seen have been patchy but watchable. And so when I was invited to see the new Woody Allen movie Melinda and Melinda, which I wasn't even aware had been released yet, I went along happily. I hadn't really heard much about it so I hoped I would be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />What I got was definitely the worst Woody Allen movie I've seen. The premise is over-explained, the cast is terrible, the script is slow and lifeless. Too many scenes said nothing and yet were stretched out, I assume to fill out what would have otherwise become a 15 minute short film.<br /><br />I don't mind the concept behind this film - two directors discuss how a simple situation could be interpreted as a comedy or a tragedy, and obviously the film proceeds to show us that, by playing out both scenarios. The problem is neither of these 'two films' are any good at all. The comedy isn't funny and the tragedy isn't very tragic. It seems like Allen came up with a good idea but then ran out of steam, or time, to actually complete the film.<br /><br />The general level of acting is notably bad also - Will Ferrell is the only one who brings anything to the table, and it's basically a Woody Allen impression. Previously good actors like Chloe Sevigny just come off as annoying, and the worst of the bunch is Radha Mitchell as Melinda (which is a shame, because her character is in nearly every scene!).<br /><br />To be fair to the actors, the script they are working with is lacking if not non-existent. Definitely a long way from the Allen we know and love from classics like Manhattan or Annie Hall.","finished_norm":["i","have","see","my","share","of","woodi","allen","movi","and","while","thei","re","not","alwai","great","you","can","usual","be","sure","you","re","go","to","be","entertain","probabl","the","last","realli","good","on","be","bullet","over","broadwai","and","mighti","aphrodit","sinc","then","the","on","i","have","see","have","be","patchi","but","watchabl","and","so","when","i","be","invit","to","see","the","new","woodi","allen","movi","melinda","and","melinda","which","i","be","not","even","awar","have","be","releas","yet","i","go","along","happili","i","have","not","realli","hear","much","about","it","so","i","hope","i","would","be","pleasantli","surprisedbr","br","what","i","get","be","definit","the","wrong","woodi","allen","movi","i","have","see","the","premis","be","overexplain","the","cast","be","terribl","the","script","be","slow","and","lifeless","too","mani","scene","sai","noth","and","yet","be","stretch","out","i","assum","to","fill","out","what","would","have","otherwis","becom","a","minut","short","filmbr","br","i","do","not","mind","the","concept","behind","thi","film","two","director","discuss","how","a","simpl","situat","can","be","interpret","a","a","comedi","or","a","tragedi","and","obvious","the","film","proce","to","show","u","that","by","plai","out","both","scenario","the","problem","be","neither","of","thi","two","film","be","ani","good","at","all","the","comedi","be","not","funni","and","the","tragedi","be","not","veri","tragic","it","seem","like","allen","come","up","with","a","good","idea","but","then","run","out","of","steam","or","time","to","actual","complet","the","filmbr","br","the","gener","level","of","act","be","notabl","bad","conjur","will","ferrel","be","the","onli","on","who","bring","anyth","to","the","tabl","and","it","basic","a","woodi","allen","impress","previous","good","actor","like","chloe","sevigni","just","come","off","a","annoi","and","the","wrong","of","the","bunch","be","radha","mitchel","a","melinda","which","be","a","shame","becaus","her","charact","be","in","nearli","everi","scenebr","br","to","be","fair","to","the","actor","the","script","thei","be","work","with","be","lack","if","not","nonexist","definit","a","long","wai","from","the","allen","we","know","and","love","from","classic","like","manhattan","or","anni","hall"],"filtered":["see","share","woodi","allen","movi","thei","re","alwai","great","usual","sure","re","go","entertain","probabl","last","realli","good","bullet","broadwai","mighti","aphrodit","sinc","see","patchi","watchabl","invit","see","new","woodi","allen","movi","melinda","melinda","even","awar","releas","yet","go","along","happili","realli","hear","much","hope","pleasantli","surprisedbr","br","get","definit","wrong","woodi","allen","movi","see","premis","overexplain","cast","terribl","script","slow","lifeless","mani","scene","sai","noth","yet","stretch","assum","fill","otherwis","becom","minut","short","filmbr","br","mind","concept","behind","thi","film","two","director","discuss","simpl","situat","interpret","comedi","tragedi","obvious","film","proce","show","u","plai","scenario","problem","neither","thi","two","film","ani","good","comedi","funni","tragedi","veri","tragic","seem","like","allen","come","good","idea","run","steam","time","actual","complet","filmbr","br","gener","level","act","notabl","bad","conjur","ferrel","onli","bring","anyth","tabl","basic","woodi","allen","impress","previous","good","actor","like","chloe","sevigni","come","annoi","wrong","bunch","radha","mitchel","melinda","shame","becaus","charact","nearli","everi","scenebr","br","fair","actor","script","thei","work","lack","nonexist","definit","long","wai","allen","know","love","classic","like","manhattan","anni","hall"],"filtered2":["see","share","woodi","allen","re","alwai","great","usual","sure","re","go","entertain","probabl","last","realli","good","bullet","broadwai","mighti","aphrodit","sinc","see","patchi","watchabl","invit","see","new","woodi","allen","melinda","melinda","even","awar","releas","yet","go","along","happili","realli","hear","hope","pleasantli","surprisedbr","get","definit","wrong","woodi","allen","see","premis","overexplain","cast","terribl","script","slow","lifeless","mani","scene","noth","yet","stretch","assum","fill","otherwis","becom","minut","short","filmbr","mind","concept","behind","two","director","discuss","simpl","situat","interpret","comedi","tragedi","obvious","proce","show","u","plai","scenario","problem","neither","two","ani","good","comedi","funni","tragedi","veri","tragic","seem","like","allen","come","good","idea","run","steam","time","actual","complet","filmbr","gener","level","act","notabl","bad","conjur","ferrel","onli","bring","anyth","tabl","basic","woodi","allen","impress","previous","good","actor","like","chloe","sevigni","come","annoi","wrong","bunch","radha","mitchel","melinda","shame","becaus","charact","nearli","everi","scenebr","fair","actor","script","work","lack","nonexist","definit","long"

{"value":"Beverly garland was born in the wrong time. She was an actress ahead of her time, bringing power and grace to even such lame flicks as the Corman films she starred in. In Gunslinger, she's the town sheriff's wife. He gets offed, so she takes over his job to pursue his killers. She's better than the material she's working with, by far. The movie is gray, stilted, and mostly boring. There's some(unintentional)humor with the tire tracks everywhere, people running behind one building to emerge suddenly in front of another (I've heard of false fronts, but this is ridiculous!), and the truly stupid plot line of the newly widowed sheriff falling in love with the guy hired to kill her. Even if she hadn't loved her husband, it had only been something like a week or two since he'd died! And she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end, anyway. No luck with men, this one.<br /><br />The villain of the piece is another woman, the saloon owner. She's scheming to buy up a bunch of land just in case the railroad goes through and makes her rich. Her plan of action if it doesn't is pretty lame-she'll just steal as much from the town as she can and skedaddle. Hell, it's just her and her hired gun at the end against an entire town. Are you telling me these people aren't armed? Look what happened in real towns of the Old West when bank robbers came in to rob the bank, then were cut down in a hail of bullets by the armed and dangerous town folk.<br /><br />There'a a lot of pointless talking and riding around, interspersed with a few lame shoot outs. The ending is as grim as usual in a Corman flick, although thank goodness it lacks the moral proselytizing at the end that was in It Conquered the World. The sheriff turns over her badge to Sam Bass and rides off into the sunset, although the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun.","finished_norm":["beverli","garland","be","bear","in","the","wrong","time","she","be","a","actress","ahead","of","her","time","bring","power","and","grace","to","even","such","lame","flick","a","the","corman","film","she","star","in","in","gunsling","she","the","town","sheriff","wife","he","get","of","so","she","take","over","hi","job","to","pursu","hi","killer","she","well","than","the","materi","she","work","with","by","far","the","movi","be","grai","stilt","and","mostli","bore","there","someunintentionalhumor","with","the","tire","track","everywher","peopl","run","behind","on","build","to","emerg","suddenli","in","front","of","anoth","i","have","hear","of","fals","front","but","thi","be","ridicul","and","the","truli","stupid","plot","line","of","the","newli","widow","sheriff","fall","in","love","with","the","gui","hire","to","kill","her","even","if","she","have","not","love","her","husband","it","have","onli","be","someth","like","a","week","or","two","sinc","he","have","die","and","she","end","up","shoot","the","gui","to","death","in","the","end","anywai","no","luck","with","man","thi","onebr","br","the","villain","of","the","piec","be","anoth","woman","the","saloon","owner","she","scheme","to","bui","up","a","bunch","of","land","just","in","case","the","railroad","go","through","and","make","her","rich","her","plan","of","action","if","it","doe","not","be","pretti","lameshel","just","steal","a","much","from","the","town","a","she","can","and","skedaddl","hell","it","just","her","and","her","hire","gun","at","the","end","against","a","entir","town","be","you","tell","me","thi","peopl","be","not","arm","look","what","happen","in","real","town","of","the","old","west","when","bank","robber","come","in","to","rob","the","bank","then","be","cut","down","in","a","hail","of","bullet","by","the","arm","and","danger","town","folkbr","br","there","a","a","lot","of","pointless","talk","and","ride","around","interspers","with","a","few","lame","shoot","out","the","end","be","a","grim","a","usual","in","a","corman","flick","although","thank","good","it","lack","the","moral","proselyt","at","the","end","that","be","in","it","conquer","the","world","the","sheriff","turn","over","her","badg","to","sam","bass","and","ride","off","into","the","sunset","although","the","movi","be","so","grai","that","you","never","see","the","sun"],"filtered":["beverli","garland","bear","wrong","time","actress","ahead","time","bring","power","grace","even","lame","flick","corman","film","star","gunsling","town","sheriff","wife","get","take","hi","job","pursu","hi","killer","well","materi","work","far","movi","grai","stilt","mostli","bore","someunintentionalhumor","tire","track","everywher","peopl","run","behind","build","emerg","suddenli","front","anoth","hear","fals","front","thi","ridicul","truli","stupid","plot","line","newli","widow","sheriff","fall","love","gui","hire","kill","even","love","husband","onli","someth","like","week","two","sinc","die","end","shoot","gui","death","end","anywai","luck","man","thi","onebr","br","villain","piec","anoth","woman","saloon","owner","scheme","bui","bunch","land","case","railroad","go","make","rich","plan","action","doe","pretti","lameshel","steal","much","town","skedaddl","hell","hire","gun","end","entir","town","tell","thi","peopl","arm","look","happen","real","town","old","west","bank","robber","come","rob","bank","cut","hail","bullet","arm","danger","town","folkbr","br","lot","pointless","talk","ride","around","interspers","lame","shoot","end","grim","usual","corman","flick","although","thank","good","lack","moral","proselyt","end","conquer","world","sheriff","turn","badg","sam","bass","ride","sunset","although","movi","grai","never","see","sun"],"filtered2":["beverli","garland","bear","wrong","time","actress","ahead","time","bring","power","grace","even","lame","flick","corman","star","gunsling","town","sheriff","wife","get","take","job","pursu","killer","well","materi","work","far","grai","stilt","mostli","bore","someunintentionalhumor","tire","track","everywher","peopl","run","behind","build","emerg","suddenli","front","anoth","hear","fals","front","ridicul","truli","stupid","plot","line","newli","widow","sheriff","fall","love","gui","hire","kill","even","love","husband","onli","someth","like","week","two","sinc","die","end","shoot","gui","death","end","anywai","luck","man","onebr","villain","piec","anoth","woman","saloon","owner","scheme","bui","bunch","land","case","railroad","go","make","rich","plan","action","doe","pretti","lameshel","steal","town","skedaddl","hell","hire","gun","end","entir","town","tell","peopl","arm","look","happen","real","town","old","west","bank","robber","come","rob","bank","cut","hail","bullet","arm","danger","town","folkbr","lot","pointless","talk","ride","around","interspers","lame","shoot","end","grim","usual","corman","flick","although","thank","good","lack","moral","proselyt","end","conquer","world","sheriff","turn","badg","sam","bass","ride","sunset

{"value":"The writers and producers of this little outing have plummeted new depths of depravity. Did writer's block set in so badly, OR had ideas dried up so much, that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman defecates in the back seat of a van, and then promptly throws the excrement at the car behind (mind you at least this summarises what this film is worth). We had already been treated to one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint, as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting; once would have sufficed... we got the message! This really is taking toilet humour to another level! Had the script and acting been better then I could have easily forgotten that I was watching a film shot entirely on low budget video. This was a fairly original storyline, with a clever (the only) piece of direction in that we only ever got to take the viewpoint from inside of the van; thus making it feel much more real. We never got to see inside any other locations, such as the store or the field where several of the women disappeared, and this could have added much needed tension.<br /><br />The script was dire. Lines like: 'I don't feel too good... I want to go home' after one of the girls has been pursued by a psychopath; subjected to rape by a screwdriver and shot at, seem a little undercooked.<br /><br />The acting was diabolical (apart from the maniac). Did all the main 5 actresses in this learn acting by taking a correspondence course during a long postal strike! The sound was so bad that I had to watch the entire film with the subtitles on.<br /><br />The director seemed to have an easy job in this.

{"value":"So, Steve Irwin. You have to admire a man who is not only willing to throw himself into a river that clearly is filled with crocs, snakes, lizards, tons of poop from the aforementioned reptiles, and mud, not only daily, but with enthusiasm. He was never able to make ME want to do it, but he managed to make his wife come close.<br /><br />This movie does not fall into my parallel universe of film category - the films for people who just had their teeth drilled, have a migraine, or have no film experience and therefore like quiet mediocrity (currently well populated by Disney films). It's too noisy. Well, Steve is too noisy. He's just so happy all the time, and would cut right through the blasé' teenager (I can hear it now: \"that movie was so STUPID\") or the Tylenol with codeine. I'd say his enthusiasm is catching, but if it was, I would own a room full of snakes, and that hasn't happened yet. I agreed they're beauties, but I'm still not going to pet them.<br /><br />Plot was indeed predictable. Bad guys were so bad, for a minute there I thought I was shopping at a consumer electronic superstore. But the movie was filled with animals, and Steve and Terri, which is why I watched it. That plot (if you could call it that) was really more of a reason to throw yet another croc in a truck. My expectations were low and stayed that way.<br /><br />I was hoping, though, that there would be a bit of a sequel, where Steve and Terri (having worked on their acting skills) have a movie with a real plot and more animals with fur. I still can't believe we won't see Steve anymore. I hope that Terri and the children continue to be involved in the Australia Zoo and the discovery channel, at least. I can't imagine seeing a crocodile without having some member of the Irwin family telling me forcefully how wonderful that croc is.

{"value":"Ohhh man! Now this is what I'm talking about! As far as bad/cheesy horror flicks go this movie was truly in a class of its own. A real gem!<br /><br />First off, the film wasn't originally in English. That's okay because the voice dubbing was truly exceptional! Here is my favorite excerpt from the dialog (and there is plenty more where this came from) \"I'm feeling a little better. I'm just thirsty FOR YOUR BLOOD!\"<br /><br />And what drama! Here is a play by play recap of the interaction between the military and scientists<br /><br />Scene 1 Scientist: \"You can't do that It'll be a disaster!\" -- Military Officer: \"That's just science fiction\" (he then proceeds to cause a complete disaster just like the scientist predicted).<br /><br />Scene 2 Scientist: \"If you do that many people will die!!!\" -- Military Officer: \"you don't know what you're talking about.\" (he does it and many people die).<br /><br />Scene 3 Scientist: \"Don't do that It'll kill everyone!\" -- Military Officer: \"That's nonsense\" (he then proceeds to kill everyone)<br /><br />Scene 4, 5, 6, 7 (you get the idea).<br /><br />If that wasn't enough there were a few scenes that really stood out as instant classics! In one scene, the military has literally 10 guys pointing guns at two unarmed men. The leader yells, \"Go get 'em!\" and all 10 army guys, one at a time, drop their guns and fist fight the two adversaries! Instant classic!<br /><br />And don't worry. No attention to detail was left out! This movie even had a hip/upbeat '80's keyboard/synth soundtrack to set the mood!<br /><br />And trust me I realize this review might contain some spoilers, but there are so many goodies in this epic I really only scratched the surface. A movie of this caliber only comes out once a decade! A true movie watching experience! A masterpiece!

{"value":"I'm a huge Randolph Scott fan, but this film is a dud. The whole thing has a canned, fake, soundstage feel to it, with truly awful rear-screen projection. It has a good plot idea that the screenwriter has successfully buried in a nitwit script, which makes it impossible for the audience to become immersed in the action and truly care about any of the characters. The directing is pedestrian, and only accentuates how bad the script is instead of helping to improve it. I've seen plenty of thoroughly enjoyable \"soundstage productions\" before, but this is not one of them. All it does is make you appreciate the gritty Scott/Boetticher films all the more.<br /><br />Randolph Scott is tanned, trim, and shines that million dollar smile throughout. He's always a pleasure...even in the worst of his films. Aside from Scott, the other main reason I wanted to see this movie was due to how much I enjoyed Ms. Wymore in Errol Flynn's movie, \"Rocky Mountian\". In \"Man Behind the Gun\", she is just as beautiful, and you can tell she's a good actress, but she was forced to say some pretty dumb lines, and the blocking she was given by the director was truly awful. I've only seen Phil Carey in \"Operation Pacific\", and he plays the exact same character here...an arrogant pain-in-the-butt you want to beat into unconsciousness. I guess it proves he's a good actor...he made me hate him. There are some lame attempts at comic relief that only detract from the film, in my opinion. Although there are many elements to knock, I must say that I found myself truly enjoying the two Spanish songs sung in the musical numbers...but that's not why we go to see Randolph Scott movies, right?<br /><br />There are definitely worse Scott films out there, and this one certainly isn't unbearable, but it also certainly couldn't be deemed anything beyond mediocre.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","huge","randolph","scott","fan","but","thi","film","be","a","dud","the","whole","thing","have","a","can","fake","soundstag","feel","to","it","with","truli","aw","rearscreen","project","it","have","a","good","plot","idea","that","the","screenwrit","have","successfulli","buri","in","a","nitwit","script","which","make","it","imposs","for","the","audienc","to","becom","immers","in","the","action","and","truli","care","about","ani","of","the","charact","the","direct","be","pedestrian","and","onli","accentu","how","bad","the","script","be","instead","of","help","to","improv","it","i","have","see","plenti","of","thoroughli","enjoy","soundstag","product","befor","but","thi","be","not","on","of","them","all","it","doe","be","make","you","appreci","the","gritti","scottboettich","film","all","the","morebr","br","randolph","scott","be","tan","trim","and","shine","that","million","dollar","smile","throughout","he","alwai","a","pleasureeven","in","the","wrong","of","hi","film","asid","from","scott","the","other","main","reason","i","want","to","see","thi","movi","be","due","to","how","much","i","enjoi","m","wymor","in","errol","flynn","movi","rocki","mountian","in","man","behind","the","gun","she","be","just","a","beauti","and","you","can","tell","she","a","good","actress","but","she","be","forc","to","sai","some","pretti","dumb","line","and","the","block","she","be","give","by","the","director","be","truli","aw","i","have","onli","see","phil","carei","in","oper","pacif","and","he","plai","the","exact","same","charact","herean","arrog","paininthebutt","you","want","to","beat","into","unconsci","i","guess","it","prove","he","a","good","actorh","make","me","hate","him","there","be","some","lame","attempt","at","comic","relief","that","onli","detract","from","the","film","in","my","opinion","although","there","be","mani","elem","to","knock","i","must","sai","that","i","find","myself","truli","enjoi","the","two","spanish","song","sing","in","the","music","numbersbut","that","not","why","we","go","to","see","randolph","scott","movi","rightbr","br","there","be","definit","wrong","scott","film","out","there","and","thi","on","certainli","be","not","unbear","but","it","conjur","certainli","can","not","be","deem","anyth","beyond","mediocr"],"filtered":["huge","randolph","scott","fan","thi","film","dud","whole","thing","fake","soundstag","feel","truli","aw","rearscreen","project","good","plot","idea","screenwrit","successfulli","buri","nitwit","script","make","imposs","audienc","becom","immers","action","truli","care","ani","charact","direct","pedestrian","onli","accentu","bad","script","instead","help","improv","see","plenti","thoroughli","enjoy","soundstag","product","befor","thi","doe","make","appreci","gritti","scottboettich","film","morebr","br","randolph","scott","tan","trim","shine","million","dollar","smile","throughout","alwai","pleasureeven","wrong","hi","film","asid","scott","main","reason","want","see","thi","movi","due","much","enjoi","m","wymor","errol","flynn","movi","rocki","mountian","man","behind","gun","beauti","tell","good","actress","forc","sai","pretti","dumb","line","block","give","director","truli","aw","onli","see","phil","carei","oper","pacif","plai","exact","charact","herean","arrog","paininthebutt","want","beat","unconsci","guess","prove","good","actorh","make","hate","lame","attempt","comic","relief","onli","detract","film","opinion","although","mani","elem","knock","must","sai","find","truli","enjoi","two","spanish","song","sing","music","numbersbut","go","see","randolph","scott","movi","rightbr","br","definit","wrong","scott","film","thi","certainli","unbear","conjur","certainli","deem","anyth","beyond","mediocr"],"filtered2":["huge","randolph","scott","fan","dud","whole","thing","fake","soundstag","feel","truli","aw","rearscreen","project","good","plot","idea","screenwrit","successfulli","buri","nitwit","script","make","imposs","audienc","becom","immers","action","truli","care","ani","charact","direct","pedestrian","onli","accentu","bad","script","instead","help","improv","see","plenti","thoroughli","enjoy","soundstag","product","befor","doe","make","appreci","gritti","scottboettich","morebr","randolph","scott","tan","trim","shine","million","dollar","smile","throughout","alwai","pleasureeven","wrong","asid","scott","main","reason","want","see","due","enjoi","m","wymor","errol","flynn","rocki","mountian","man","behind","gun","beauti","tell","good","actress","forc","pretti","dumb","line","block","give","director","truli","aw","onli","see","phil","carei","oper","pacif","plai","exact","charact","herean","arrog","paininthebutt","want","beat","unconsci","guess","prove","good","actorh","make","hate","lame","attempt","comic","relief","onli","detract","opinion","although","mani","elem","knock","must","find","truli","enjoi","two","spanish","song","sing","music","numbersbut","go","see","randolph","scott","rightbr","definit","wrong","scott","certainli","unbear","conjur"

{"value":"Do not waste your time with this movie. This is a total thrash in terms of acting, directing, sound editing, soundtrack... There was such a waste of performance by some of the very good actors. The movie does not do justice to Paresh Rawal who is perhaps one of the most talented actors in Bollywood. Akshay Kumar who is also an emerging star did quite a poor job. John Abraham, what is wrong with him? Is that what you call acting? I mean he should thank God that he has a pretty face otherwise he'd be winning Razzie awards in India if there were any such awards in Bollywood. Asrani a great talent, but overdoes his bit as before.<br /><br />Screenplay which was not to mention a rip-off from the 1965's Boeing Boeing was quite badly framed. First of all, people in Bollywood just can't make something original. On top of that they don't even know how to copy well. The jokes in the movie were so overdone, it was getting painful to sit through them. Priyadarshan may be a star in the south, but he's just not fit to make a decent Hindi movie. The sound editing is amazingly crappy. I can go on and on this matter, but the bottom-line is that Bollywood should be shameful of making such a film.<br /><br />The worst part is that some people seemed to love this movie. What is wrong with you guys? This is the reason why Bollywood is where it is. Did you know that Bollywood makes more movies than Hollywood every year, however, most of the movies are unheard of abroad, because of movies like this one. I am an Indian and I am utterly shameful of Bollywood for producing this piece of thrash. Movies like Dil Chahta Hai and Lagaan were just terrific. They are world class films which are timeless... among the best of this decade. Garam Masala, however, is perhaps one of the worst of this century.

{"value":"Absolutely fantastic. <br /><br />Now, before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés, allow me to elaborate. Much as I enjoyed it, this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film I've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim, as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst. Of course, they weren't helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence. The plot (to stretch the term slightly) was thin to non-existent and the 'gore' scenes, whilst undoubtedly brutal, were irrelevant and laughably formulaic. What plot there is revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like disconnected set pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking rather than scaring the audience. Whilst there really are very, very few positives to draw from this film, its redeeming features are the very flaws that make it such a dreadful film. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in stitches and remained that way throughout. For my part I came out flushed with laughter, buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of appalling film-making. Whichever way you look at it, this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how not to make a film.<br /><br />P.S.

{"value":"to be honest, i didn't watch all of the original 'howling', but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie. so great, that seven horrible sequels had to be made. they started off with \"Howling II: Your Sister Is A Werewolf\". i got this movie on VHS from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when Atari was brand new. i just watched it last night, and it wasn't really BAD, it was just weird. i mean, the whole thing with Sybil Danning going three-way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing (but kinda hot), Christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she's a vampire, etc. actually, this movie was actually like some sort of mish-mash of Dracula and The Lost Boys...except with werewolves, because everything Christopher Lee (whom played Dracula himself) was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie (stake in the heart, garlic, the creature of the night must die AT NIGHT, and the ruler of werewolves lives in TRANSYLVANIA). not much for the acting, but the worst of it came from Annie McEnroe. i swear, at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out, because that damn throat always had to say SOMETHING. Anyway, the plot is pretty silly and clichéd, so there's no real point in telling you, you could just read about it on Wikipedia. By the way, the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it's the ONLY film out of all the seven sequels thats related in any way to the original (not counting Howling IV (1988), which was a remake of the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel). so don't see this movie. there's no real horror, hardly any werewolves, and just horrible special fx.

{"value":"It is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any \"gray matters\" will agree that this movie just doesn't work.<br /><br />The problems lay in the direction, cast selections and lack of depth in the character building. The word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used. Let's look at the problems in direction/script.<br /><br />Brother and sister both in their mid 30's seem to be well adjusted. They meet a complete stranger at a park and Heather Graham character walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half sane person would be running the other way or at least scream for a police officer. He then awkwardly walks over and makes some stupid statements and she falls for him. Then after ONE date were they all go out together he falls in love with her and decides to get married in Vegas in a week's time???? Hello does anyone feel stupid yet? He goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about 10 words that WE see on the screen and he wants to marry her. Not only was there no chemistry it just doesn't make sense. Sure it's a romantic comedy and I want to believe it could, but the direction made it completely flat.<br /><br />Now Heather falls head over heels with her too and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan (very shallow character) kiss or more to the point it was sloppiest kiss ever that chemistry MIGHT be there. I found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say Heather cannot act i think the reality is Heather was clearly the wrong person for this role. <br /><br />This was Sue Kramer debut as a director and to me it was just too much for her to chew. It would take a lot of craft to make this movie work and IMHO it could be done with better writers and casting and direction.","finished_norm":["it","be","import","not","to","be","insult","by","lack","of","logic","or","common","sens","and","that","who","have","ani","grai","matter","will","agre","that","thi","movi","just","doe","not","workbr","br","the","problem","lie","in","the","direct","cast","select","and","lack","of","depth","in","the","charact","build","the","word","comedi","be","veri","hard","thing","to","sai","when","i","expect","to","laugh","when","thi","word","be","us","let","look","at","the","problem","in","directionscriptbr","br","brother","and","sister","both","in","their","mid","seem","to","be","good","adjust","thei","meet","a","complet","strang","at","a","park","and","heather","graham","charact","walk","up","to","her","and","ask","the","much","intim","question","that","even","half","sane","person","would","be","run","the","other","wai","or","at","littl","scream","for","a","polic","offic","he","then","awkwardli","walk","over","and","make","some","stupid","statem","and","she","fall","for","him","then","after","on","date","be","thei","all","go","out","togeth","he","fall","in","love","with","her","and","decid","to","get","marri","in","vega","in","a","week","time","hello","doe","anyon","feel","stupid","yet","he","go","out","with","thousand","of","woman","and","he","meet","thi","on","person","who","sai","about","word","that","we","see","on","the","screen","and","he","want","to","marri","her","not","onli","be","there","no","chemistri","it","just","doe","not","make","sens","sure","it","a","romant","comedi","and","i","want","to","believ","it","can","but","the","direct","make","it","complet","flatbr","br","now","heather","fall","head","over","heel","with","her","too","and","when","heather","graham","and","bridget","moynahan","veri","shallow","charact","kiss","or","much","to","the","point","it","be","sloppi","kiss","ever","that","chemistri","mai","be","there","i","find","it","unromant","and","unfunni","and","while","mani","sai","heather","cannot","act","i","think","the","realiti","be","heather","be","clearli","the","wrong","person","for","thi","role","br","br","thi","be","sue","kramer","debut","a","a","director","and","to","me","it","be","just","too","much","for","her","to","chew","it","would","take","a","lot","of","craft","to","make","thi","movi","work","and","imho","it","can","be","do","with","well","writer","and","cast","and","direct"],"filtered":["import","insult","lack","logic","common","sens","ani","grai","matter","agre","thi","movi","doe","workbr","br","problem","lie","direct","cast","select","lack","depth","charact","build","word","comedi","veri","hard","thing","sai","expect","laugh","thi","word","us","let","look","problem","directionscriptbr","br","brother","sister","mid","seem","good","adjust","thei","meet","complet","strang","park","heather","graham","charact","walk","ask","much","intim","question","even","half","sane","person","run","wai","littl","scream","polic","offic","awkwardli","walk","make","stupid","statem","fall","date","thei","go","togeth","fall","love","decid","get","marri","vega","week","time","hello","doe","anyon","feel","stupid","yet","go","thousand","woman","meet","thi","person","sai","word","see","screen","want","marri","onli","chemistri","doe","make","sens","sure","romant","comedi","want","believ","direct","make","complet","flatbr","br","heather","fall","head","heel","heather","graham","bridget","moynahan","veri","shallow","charact","kiss","much","point","sloppi","kiss","ever","chemistri","mai","find","unromant","unfunni","mani","sai","heather","act","think","realiti","heather","clearli","wrong","person","thi","role","br","br","thi","sue","kramer","debut","director","much","chew","take","lot","craft","make","thi","movi","work","imho","well","writer","cast","direct"],"filtered2":["import","insult","lack","logic","common","sens","ani","grai","matter","agre","doe","workbr","problem","lie","direct","cast","select","lack","depth","charact","build","word","comedi","veri","hard","thing","expect","laugh","word","us","let","look","problem","directionscriptbr","brother","sister","mid","seem","good","adjust","meet","complet","strang","park","heather","graham","charact","walk","ask","intim","question","even","half","sane","person","run","wai","littl","scream","polic","offic","awkwardli","walk","make","stupid","statem","fall","date","go","togeth","fall","love","decid","get","marri","vega","week","time","hello","doe","anyon","feel","stupid","yet","go","thousand","woman","meet","person","word","see","screen","want","marri","onli","chemistri","doe","make","sens","sure","romant","comedi","want","believ","direct","make","complet","flatbr","heather","fall","head","heel","heather","graham","bridget","moynahan","veri","shallow","charact","kiss","point","sloppi","kiss","ever","chemistri","mai","find","unromant","unfunni","mani","heather","act","think","realiti","heather","clearli","wrong","person","role","sue","kramer","debut","director","chew","take","lot","craft","make","work","imho","well","writer","cast","d
