{"value":"Only the most ardent DORIS DAY fan could find this one even bearable to watch. When one thinks of the wealth of material available for a story about New York City's most famous blackout, a film that could have dealt with numerous real-life stories of what people had to cope with, this scrapes the bottom of the barrel for lack of story-telling originality.<br /><br />Once again Doris is indignant because she suspects she may have been compromised on the night of the blackout when she returned to her Connecticut lodgings, took a sleeping potion and woke up in the morning with a man who had done the same, wandering into the house by mistake.<br /><br />Nobody is able to salvage this mess--not Doris, not ROBERT MORSE, TERRY-THOMAS, PATRICK O'NEAL or LOLA ALBRIGHT. As directed by Hy Averback, it's the weakest vehicle Day found herself in, committed to do the film because of her husband's machinations and unable to get out of it.

bad.","finished_norm":["onli","the","much","ardent","dori","dai","fan","can","find","thi","on","even","bearabl","to","watch","when","on","think","of","the","wealth","of","materi","avail","for","a","stori","about","new","york","citi","much","famou","blackout","a","film","that","can","have","deal","with","numer","reallif","stori","of","what","peopl","have","to","cope","with","thi","scrape","the","bottom","of","the","barrel","for","lack","of","storytel","originalitybr","br","onc","again","dori","be","indign","becaus","she","suspect","she","mai","have","be","compromis","on","the","night","of","the","blackout","when","she","return","to","her","connecticut","lodg","take","a","sleep","potion","and","wake","up","in","the","morn","with","a","man","who","have","do","the","same","wander","into","the","hous","by","mistakebr","br","nobodi","be","abl","to","salvag","thi","messnot","dori","not","robert","mors","terrythoma","patrick","o","neal","or","lola","albright","a","direct","by","hy","averback","it","the","weak","vehicl","dai","find","herself","in","commit","to","do","the","film","becaus","of","her","husband","machin","and","unabl","to","get","out","of","it","too","bad"],"filtered":["onli","much","ardent","dori","dai","fan","find","thi","even","bearabl","watch","think","wealth","materi","avail","stori","new","york","citi","much","famou","blackout","film","deal","numer","reallif","stori","peopl","cope","thi","scrape","bottom","barrel","lack","storytel","originalitybr","br","onc","dori","indign","becaus","suspect","mai","compromis","night","blackout","return","connecticut","lodg","take","sleep","potion","wake","morn","man","wander","hous","mistakebr","br","nobodi","abl","salvag","thi","messnot","dori","robert","mors","terrythoma","patrick","o","neal","lola","albright","direct","hy","averback","weak","vehicl","dai","find","commit","film","becaus","husband","machin","unabl","get","bad"],"filtered2":["onli","ardent","dori","dai","fan","find","even","bearabl","watch","think","wealth","materi","avail","stori","new","york","citi","famou","blackout","deal","numer","reallif","stori","peopl","cope","scrape","bottom","barrel","lack","storytel","originalitybr","onc","dori","indign","becaus","suspect","mai","compromis","night","blackout","return","connecticut","lodg","take","sleep","potion","wake","morn","man","wander","hous","mistakebr","nobodi","abl","salvag","messnot","dori","robert","mors","terrythoma","patrick","o","neal","lola","albright","direct","hy","averback","weak","vehicl","dai","find","commit","becaus","husband","machin","unabl","get","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,7,9,11,12,17,22,23,31,38,45,46,87,102,132,140,183,210,213,236,379,454,468,488,536,537,539,595,732,827,860,865,866,969,977,994,1071,1242,1375,1424,1500,1586,1592,1695,2028,2505,2891,3247,3499,3957,4486,4704,4727,4779,5513,5687,6250,6995,7766,8013,8364,8432],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,7,9,11,12,17,22,23,31,38,45,46,87,102,132,140,183,210,213,236,379,454,468,488,536,537,539,595,732,827,860,865,866,969,977,994,1071,1242,1375,1424,1500,1586,1592,1695,2028,2505,2891,3247,3499,3957,4486,4704,4727,4779,5513,5687,6250,6995,7766,8013,8364,8432],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.5541073880211935,2.5958480334723544,1.364847727375781,1.4070669811451506,3.038623282696244,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,2.115024371522662,2.087553710177271,4.506988091575534,2.317169775997098,2.4885128563647294,2.687151791517189,2.8432628718938773,2.617923930016232,3.1272886331425473,3.2556198060399626,3.304513710030018,3.3933092088131493,3.6254214301101193,3.424750734647968,3.6105180246075443,3.6284289511740746,3.7099788181381825,4.062925891962901,3.8538340941043407,3.9201351739255808,3.8962296530720266,4.0536665665501035,4.035401218572811,4.140259095366071,4.30366520516749,4.364659717870332,4.390138803171316,4.470719289830655,4.520909034354511,4.589376833631972,4.589376833631972,4.770124825978496,4.979216623837056,5.339219357868463,5.390512652256013,5.649374286172302,5.649374286172302,5.967828017290836,5.967828017290836,6.101359409915359,19.02756440019674,6.137727054086234,6.543192162194399,6.2980697041614135,6.437831646536572,13.737229125258052,7.0356686472921925,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.5937294628391993E-5,4.562752871144994E-5,4.598223923909046E-5,4.5716553370901796E-5,0.22800789447452716,4.56533987324859E-5,4.5789178336949434E-5,4.563409877744519E-5,4.5736700867098973E-5,5.074237294391955E-5,0.09492605797615371,4.556043528081096E-5,4.641079821204075E-5,0.23175241014363487,4.559365747493583E-5,4.5467656277486026E-5

{"value":"Not sure why this film was advertised as a wild, quirky, laugh filled comedy. There is not much in this movie that will entertain, nor amuse the moviegoer. Annette Bening (whose acting was touted as being Oscar worthy) comes off here as mannered, with her performance seeming routine. Brian Cox's character is confusing and irritating, and the lead playing Augusten  Joseph Cross  appears to simply not have the personality to carry his role. The best thing about the film is Evan Rachel Wood, but she is not enough to endorse this boring, unsavory film.<br /><br />The film disappeared quickly and it seems with good reason. I found some of the scenes distasteful (the scene with Brian Cox and his just utilized toilet rivals some of the worst scenes in 'You and Me and Everyone We Know' and 'The Squid and the Whale'), some embarrassing, and most of them unsettling. I found the whole experience a waste of time.

It's pathetic!<br /><br />Anyway, I turned on the movie near the end, so I didn't get much of the plot. But this must've been the best part. This nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix-ish girl...this scene is straight out of the comic books -- or the cheap porn movies. She calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father \"Oh, I didn't expect tongue!\" Great lines!<br /><br />After this, I had to see how it ended..<br /><br />Well, of course, this bitch from hell has a helluva past, so the SWAT team is upstairs.

{"value":"In over 70 years of watching movies,This has to be one of the very worst comedies ever made. Mel Brooks, Mike Meyers & a few other have made some very bad comedies, this however is the absolute bottom of the barrel.<br /><br />It is unfunny from the very opening,to the tacked on scene during the credits.<br /><br />Diane Keaton who I normally like must have needed her paycheck badly. She desperately needs to re-learn her craft.<br /><br />Dax Shepard (I do not know who he is),needs a better director,to show him how to act.<br /><br />Liv Tyler is also not up to her role.<br /><br />Mike White needs to find another character,he has done this same type person a few times too many.<br /><br />Ken Howard who started out years back as a first rate actor, also not as good as he used

{"value":"As many others have stated, this is a terrible movie, from every aspect of movie making. How they ever got some known name actors to take on this project is amazing.<br /><br />Many people have complained that it was shot on 'cheap' video cameras. Yes, it was shot on video, but not 'cheap' video. What made it bad was the lighting, white balancing, shooting technique and editing.<br /><br />There were so many different shooting and editing techniques used that it was a production mess. Harsh, inconsistent lighting, over use of hand held shooting (ala Woody Allen), choppy editing (another Allen technique), but poorly done, without real purpose.<br /><br />The lack of white balance in the restaurant kitchen scenes is embarrassing; very amateurish.<br /><br />The simulated sex scenes had no acting value at any level.<br /><br />How this video ever made it to print is beyond me.

{"value":"I ordered the movie from Korea because I was an extra in it and was interested to see how it turned out.<br /><br />Having watched it I can say that I am ashamed to have had any part of it. I feel embarrassed not only for myself but for everyone else who had any part in the making of this mockery of British \"comedy\".<br /><br />From beginning to end the film is predictable, tedious, dull, monotonous and cringe-worthy to the point that on several occasions I actually looked away from the screen in dis-belief. Until you actually see the movie it is difficult to conceive how un-romantic and un-comedic a romantic comedy can be.<br /><br />It's not only a bad story, but a badly-made film. In one scene, you can actually see a runner or assistant director showing the S.A.'s when to wipe across.

{"value":"'Chances Are' a big mistake to see. You could know director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and should expect something amusing from him. But I guess I have to disillusion you. He made a really, really bad movie.<br /><br />According to the story Christopher McDonald dies to reburn as a baby. The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, huh?).<br /><br />They fall in love with each other. Then appears Jr former wife, Cybill Shepherd, and Jr falls in love with her too. I guess I don't even have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil.<br /><br />In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jr's on his worst. He copies Michael J Fox.<br /><br />After the 'Moonlighting' Shepherd proves that she's not suitable for acting in movies.<br /><br />Anyway, there's one thing this unfunny comedy can be used: as

{"value":"MY BROTHER TOM <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Dolby Digital<br /><br />Following an episode of sexual abuse at the hands of a trusted neighbor, young Jessica (Jenna Harrison) forms a relationship with a strange boy (Ben Whishaw) she meets in the woods. Unfortunately, Whishaw has secrets of his own, no less troubling and far more dangerous...<br /><br />Dour drama, sparked by brave performances by Harrison and Whishaw, in which two kindred spirits immerse themselves in a mutual love of nature after being traumatized by their experiences in the 'real world'. Unfortunately, their friendship unravels as harsh reality begins to intrude, leading to an inevitable tragedy. Directed by Dom Rotheroe and photographed in digital video format, the movie looks ragged in places (too many awkward close-ups and sloppy hand-held camera moves) and takes a while to find its feet,

{"value":"This movie is a total dog. I found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so I wouldn't feel like I'd totally wasted my money--and my time. The writing in this film is absolutely terrible. It's a shame it's not up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies.<br /><br />They should have saved the money on getting D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right. Even Gary Coleman wasn't properly utilized for his role.<br /><br />This movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was--including the subplots. After viewing this movie, I'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of Napolean Dynamite-like humor, where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery.

{"value":"When I first saw this film, I thought it should have come from the children's section - It's very fun and at times humorous, and is actually quite a good story, but it severely lacks the \"romantic chemistry\" that actors like Meg Ryan and Tim Robbins are capable of delivering. I must note that Walter Matthau is perfect for the part of Albert Einstein, and his performance is extraordinary, but that's the sole exception. This film appears a bit forced, the directing lacks substance, and oh yeah...the music is ridiculously awful, it didn't put me in a very good mood. But if you are not expecting a smart, well-crafted comedy/romance tale, then this certainly can be entertaining, like I said..it should be in the children's section. Einstein and his buddies are a good relief from Tim Robbins' boring, almost tense quest to steal Meg Ryan's heart.

{"value":"I'm writing this because I somehow felt being led to believe Dark Remains was a good movie. Whilst it's not the worst I've seen, it certainly isn't good.<br /><br />A Weak script, weak actors, and weak directing. Even if they can't afford big name cast, would it be too much to ask for a more attractive lead actress? It was painful to watch a plain actress through out the film with her dull performance. The story was a cliché and poorly scripted. The special effects were minimal. The \"suspense\" tricks employed repetitively here were hard to swallow.<br /><br />To be fair, Dark Remains is no worse than quite some of the Masters of Horrors' episodes. But not quite on par with quality movies yet. Dark Remains is only recommended for the hardcore horror fans who don't want to miss any movie in the genre, even if it's a poorly made one.

{"value":"Read on and take note - you could save 88 minutes of your life (was that all!).<br /><br />Unremittingly bleak, this film sets out to produce (I'm guessing) a modern small town American Christmas fable in the Capra style. If fails....completely and absolutely fails. I've been trying to think of one good thing about it and can't. Let me mention some of the highlights ...<br /><br />People don't die, they get to spend eternity as immigrant workers in Santa's factory. Angels are actually ex-cowboys who sit in trees. Santa can bring people back from the dead (if you send him a nice letter). <br /><br />And the plot.. I won't spoil it for you but there has to be some light in films if only to contrast with the darkness but there isn't any. Even the photography is bleak - snow shown at the end of a freeze, everywhere looking cold, damp and miserable. <br /><br />As you might guess, the film has a happy (schmaltzy) ending.

{"value":"Last night I decided to watch the prequel or shall I say the so called prequel to Carlito's Way - \"Carlito's Way: Rise to Power (2005)\" which went straight to DVD...no wonder .....it completely ...and I mean completely S%&KS !!! waist of time watching it and I think it would be a pure waist of time writing about it.... I don't understand how De Palma agreed on producing this sh#t-fest of a movie....except for only one fact that I tip my hat to... Jay Hernandez who plays the young Brigante.... reminded me how De Niro got into the shoes of Brando to portray the young Don Corleone in Godfather II ...but the difference De Niro was amazing and even got an Oscar for it !!! Jay Hernandez well he has guts for trying to be a young Pacino.... too bad for him I don't think he will be playing in film anymore and by the way after I watched this sh#$%ty movie, I sat down and

{"value":"I would of given this film a zero out of ten, but i will give it a two. Reason One is that Shah Rukh Khan appears in the film, which is not really a reason. Last Point is that Rani Appears in this film and does a smooch with Kamal. I Love Rani very much and have a respect that she is a great actress. Which is why i didn't enjoy her in this movie kissing Kamal, but its no big deal. Anyway enough of the bedroom scenes that made this film noticeable, lets actually talk about this film. Is it good or bad, I think its a completely rubbish movie that made me yawn. Me being a Fantastic critic, you can see my other 250+ review's by clicking on my name, I have great taste. The movie is not entertaining is one thing and if this is suppose to be hard hitting cinema, why is there no morale in this movie. Its a biased movie thats not a true story and it stinks.

{"value":"Everything about this film is hog wash. Pitiful acting, awful dialog, ugly native girls. this movie sinks into oblivion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The director must have been a weekend bender. Robert C. is totally lost and has not got a clue on what is going on . The college kids are worst. No acting talent at all, very stupid reasoning, and just down right dumbbells. Special effects are for the birds. The so called security force around this park belongs in toy land: with stupid looking guns, walkie talkies that are useless; and a computer system that ranks with a roll of toilet paper. if the park is under construction and nothing works; why bother inviting potential clients until everything is complete. the writers should be the first victims of the mess along with the producers and the crew. The whole film belongs in a septic tank shot to another planet for viewing. What a gem.

can't.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","exactli","what","you","get","when","you","realli","over","stretch","your","abil","it","like","someon","who","have","just","pass","there","drive","test","and","then","pit","them","in","a","formula","grand","prix","not","i","mai","add","the","u","grand","prix","a","everyon","mai","pull","out","due","to","dodgi","tyr","and","you","mai","just","win","that","be","how","far","short","thi","film","fall","now","do","not","take","thi","the","wrong","wai","i","love","bmovi","around","half","my","collect","be","make","of","bmovi","but","i","do","not","think","there","be","enough","letter","in","the","alphabet","to","describ","how","bad","thi","film","isbr","br","of","the","stori","for","a","bmovi","be","not","that","bad","it","have","potenti","there","to","make","a","bmovi","brand","be","not","talk","fridai","th","potenti","but","potenti","none","the","littl","but","what","realli","let","thi","film","down","be","the","act","at","not","on","do","i","believ","anyth","it","like","watch","qvc","except","the","present","on","qvc","tend","to","have","a","heavi","tanbr","br","in","summari","i","have","like","to","sai","i","have","see","wrong","film","but","i","ca","not"],"filtered":["thi","film","exactli","get","realli","stretch","abil","like","someon","pass","drive","test","pit","formula","grand","prix","mai","add","u","grand","prix","everyon","mai","pull","due","dodgi","tyr","mai","win","far","short","thi","film","fall","take","thi","wrong","wai","love","bmovi","around","half","collect","make","bmovi","think","enough","letter","alphabet","describ","bad","thi","film","isbr","br","stori","bmovi","bad","potenti","make","bmovi","brand","talk","fridai","th","potenti","potenti","none","littl","realli","let","thi","film","act","believ","anyth","like","watch","qvc","except","present","qvc","tend","heavi","tanbr","br","summari","like","sai","see","wrong","film","ca"],"filtered2":["exactli","get","realli","stretch","abil","like","someon","pass","drive","test","pit","formula","grand","prix","mai","add","u","grand","prix","everyon","mai","pull","due","dodgi","tyr","mai","win","far","short","fall","take","wrong","wai","love","bmovi","around","half","collect","make","bmovi","think","enough","letter","alphabet","describ","bad","isbr","stori","bmovi","bad","potenti","make","bmovi","brand","talk","fridai","th","potenti","potenti","none","littl","realli","let","act","believ","anyth","like","watch","qvc","except","present","qvc","tend","heavi","tanbr","summari","like","see","wrong","ca"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,9,12,13,14,17,21,25,31,33,46,54,81,91,93,98,101,104,112,124,139,170,186,206,233,246,272,299,370,411,461,462,487,489,544,547,568,668,847,853,1026,1176,1177,1220,1287,1306,1663,1674,1709,1744,1839,1932,2551,3033,5154],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,7,9,12,13,14,17,21,25,31,33,46,54,81,91,93,98,101,104,112,124,139,170,186,206,233,246,272,299,370,411,461,462,487,489,544,547,568,668,847,853,1026,1176,1177,1220,1287,1306,1663,1674,1709,1744,1839,1932,2551,3033,5154],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,2.559277576165403,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,4.967313881255199,1.8113893252729412,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.035389827120098,2.0881990796736947,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.2466628996789315,2.2323930368088845,2.2939035841256437,2.4071371113909277,2.571852579609833,2.597304642813496,2.6102777977348763,2.673149229007135,2.8028805344481915,2.7949961309240425,2.9958122703541616,3.229006157521873,3.358217889001879,3.2639531875991072,3.3220965805878846,3.3956930001684253,3.4222967456864013,10.29644712638824,3.4471119148061256,3.5813614403160887,3.900174431363043,3.8962296530720266,4.062925891962901,4.358390104856736,4.263079925052412,4.30366520516749,17.996359947839487,4.499089986959872,4.828393734102471,4.74221603786142,4.733083554298147,9.738431457245454,4.760735085628657,4.8184434032493035,5.185068678041204,5.501738287366237,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.079031127126785E-5,6.0380387990751053E-5,6.0849787931711786E-5,6.049819720878785E-5,6.0499188403635755E-5,6.041462262829538E-5,6.0594304180863924E-5,6.0389082372084455E-5,6.0524859043688464E-5,6.71490271870981E-5,0.9435837836230841,6.029160107881392E-5,0.05166664319094627,6.229303968702082E-5,6.0335565085364654E-5,6.016882361581385E-5,6.166965965588757E-5,6.059998140978068E-5,6.0411970203527375E-5,6.0462040985760695E-5,6.104704669399795E-5,6.066002065668306E-5,6.072909129271575E-5,6.079452007726261E-5,6.12610867858

{"value":"\"The Bank\" (1915, Chaplin) \"The Bank\" was one of Charlie's 1915 Essanay films. While these group of films are more watchable than their 1914 counterparts, this one seems a bit below average. The gag with the janitorial double combo-locked vault and the tough-luck ending that has Charlie waking up from a dream, in which he is stroking the lead lady's hair, only to be stroking the head of a mop he had used as a quasi pillow, are both classic Chaplin moments. They are both ironically the beginning and the end. The middle is filled in with fighting with the rival co-worker janitor and busting up a bank robbery to win the girl. The mop is probably the greatest physical prop of this movie and Charlie uses it to expert comedic effect whether while it is the intention of his character or not. The mop seems to be Charlie's alter-ego doing things he wishes he could do but wouldn't with his own two hands.

{"value":"This movie had to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The acting was terrible, Horrible and cheesy and talk about a predictable plot! I will never watch this movie again nor will I recommend this movie to anyone. What a waste of time! First, as soon as the movie began I realized what I got myself into. All they did for this movie was copy scenes from many other horror movies out there and bunched them all into this one movie. The prank phone calls, halloween night, a psycho, and one knife! Its absolutely ridiculous. I was not scared at all during the movie, which I thought horror movies were supposed to do. As for the making of the movie, its pretty hilarious how they all talk about how this movie was so great and so scary. I mean how do you not realize that the movies is a cheap rip off of \"Scary Movie\" for example. At least get some good actors in there and then maybe it would have been pulled off as a good horror

{"value":"I caught this at a test screening. All I can say is: What...the...hell? This movie plays out about as smoothly as Mickey Mouse reading the script for \"Scarface.\" It's bizarre beyond making the slightest bit of sense; and even if you do leave your brain in the car, the film is still so bizarre that it isn't even funny.<br /><br />The plot involves crocodile hunter Steve Irwin trying to \"save\" a crocodile which contains a CIA probe. The CIA comes after Irwin to get their probe back, Irwin mistakes them for poachers, and sets out to \"stop\" them.<br /><br />That's about all the story there is; the rest is over-the-top lampooning of Australian culture (\"Didja see dat?\" and \"Crikey!\") and strangely choreographed action sequences. At one point, Irwin mounts a speeding RV and knife fights with a CIA agent on top of it. Yes, that's right: Steve Irwin knife fights a guy on top of an RV.

{"value":"In a word, this film was boring. It lacked life and spark. A big problem is with the two leads. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever. He was boring, and she was annoying. <br /><br />The visuals were interesting, but they didn't enhance the scenes. If anything, the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen. None of the action sequences felt real, and hence, the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger.<br /><br />The film had potential, but it needed a better script, better acting, and a better director. I kept thinking during the film, you know, this movie would've worked if Harrison Ford was Sky Captain, Karen Allen was Polly, and Steven Spielberg was the director. <br /><br />Ignore the critical acclaims for this film. The critics I think are praising the film because they *want* to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different

{"value":"This might be the worst film ever made, and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone. Streisand is laughably unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man in order to study Judaism. The soundtrack is torturous, featuring Barbara belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film. And don't even get me started on the plot. You will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible. The rampant ego of Streisand, thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to Oscar heights, led to this disaster. I'm pretty sure the novelist, Isaac Bashevis Singer, hated this film and never forgave Streisand. I can't blame him. This movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of 'The Sound of Music' being played backwards on an old turntable. It's truly that bad. I'm amazed that anyone from Streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was

{"value":"For months preceding the release of this movie you saw it advertised in all sorts of print media, so I patiently waited for its video release to see what all the hype was about. After it was over I had to apologize to my roommate for occupying the VCR for the last hour and a half to watch such a horrible movie. It essentially fails because it is a character based movie about unredeemable characters. With the possible exception of Amanda Peet (whose only redeemable quality is that she is Amanda Peet) you cannot stand any of them. The film relies on its dialogue which is sophomoric, moronic, and crude. The only slightly amusing character is Eric, whose portrayal of the sole married member of a group of friends is dead on. The final twist, designed to make you laugh at the three main characters, only instead inspires the same kind of resentment towards Peet.

{"value":"I purchased this movie at a car boot sale, so I was not expecting it to be a horror movie on the same level as A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) or The Hills Have Eyes (1977) but I thought that it would still be fairly enjoyable to watch. However, it proved to be not at all enjoyable, but instead the acting and the general movie was mock-able, such as the ways the the 'unsees killer' murders his victims and how all of the people killed just happen to be young blonde women. It was a stereotypical horror film. I say this because of the following reasons:<br /><br />1) Three blonde women in danger, the majority get killed. 2) One survives by crawling around in the dark while being chased by the killer. 3) Surprise surprise, help arrives in the form of a shotgun!<br /><br />By using three simple points, I have saved you two odd hours by summarising this poor excuse of a horror movie, so you are now

{"value":"This film, like the first one (\"The Man From Snowy River\") has the same good and bad features, perhaps even more so than the original. Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good. <br /><br />The GOOD - Magnificent scenery, better than the first film. I love those high country shots in Australia. Tom Burlinson is still a likable guy, as \"Jim Craig.\" Bruce Rowland did a nice job with the music, too.<br /><br />The BAD - Once again we get an extremely obnoxious feminist heroine \"Jessica\" (Sigrid Thornton) who is a world-class pouter with an extremely annoying face and manner about her. In this film, we also get a big downgrade in who pays the father. Previously it was Kirk Douglas, now replaced by the always -profane Brian Dennehy. Speaking of that, it is a disgrace that a Walt Disney film would includes usages of the Lord's name in vain. That was one reason was almost totally down the tubes in the 1980s.

{"value":"I'm afraid that I have to disagree with the majority. I found Spike Lee's latest a wee bit boring! Although he was trying something different, i.e. not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I don't think it worked too well.<br /><br />There's really a bit too much going on - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's (Mira Sorvino) relationship, Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia types. The story is good, but at the end thats all you have - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer could Mr Lee not have put more into that side of the film? ><br /><br />There are some good points though. All scenes with the 'Son of Sam' killer David Berkowitz look very nice (colour saturation etc...)and the acting is pretty good throughout.<br /><br />Overall I felt that the different stories would of worked well on their own or else without the killings.

{"value":"This movie proves that you can't judge a movie by the awesome artwork on the DVD cover. It also goes to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it (or get it for someone at Christmas). The beginning of this movie actually looks somewhat promising. Well, until you meet the characters. Pumpkin Jack (the old guy from down the street) brings the college co-eds a book full of witch's spells that he leaves at their annual haunted house (where the movie takes place). After that there is some drinking, fighting, and soft core porn. Then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour.<br /><br />Overall, Hallow's End was predictable, unsuspensful, and reminiscent of a soft-core porn. This movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do, as it is a good movie to make fun of.

{"value":"Spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? Have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? Could this be it? Why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? Why is this question never answered? Why was the opening text crawl incoherent? Why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? Has there always been a gold mine in downtown Vancouver? Why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? Why does Tara Reid's character suddenly show up at Christian Slater's apartment for sex? (Or did I just answer my own question?) Why would even a non-archaeologist bang open an obviously valuable solid gold chest with a sledgehammer? Why would modern computers still display green pre-Tron-era grid outlines of objects, complete with little \"bleeps\"? And must all movie explosive timers have digital displays?

{"value":"I am not one of those who think King is a great writer, his books are fine distractions for a few hours, and often have interesting premises, however they, in my opinion, fall apart pretty rapidly if you give them any serious thought.<br /><br />This film suffers from being a pretty exact re-telling of King's story. If you have read the book, there are zero surprises, no changes, no altering of scenes or characters. This is a film made by King fans for King fans.<br /><br />For the rest of us, there is nothing terrible about the film, it is a 'gypsy curse' horror, with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for, to become thinner. The final third has some severe structural problems, and the slightly forced ending seems to break the rules of this genre a little.<br /><br />There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life,

{"value":"A trio of low-life criminals, led by Matt Dillon, botches a late-night burglary. They flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist. Of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist, the real terrorist gets away, and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar, taking hostages, unaware why the police are so intent on catching them. And guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night?<br /><br />Unbelievable? Absolutely. And it goes down hill from there. Spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent; Matt Dillon, Faye Dunaway, Gary Sinise, Viggo Mortensen, and M. Emmett Walsh, but they're all wasted. Mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar, all they do for the remainder of the film is argue. Endlessly and aimlessly.

{"value":"I absolutely love all of Tom Robbins books, so I was very excited and interested to see a movie made after one of his books. I knew that there would be no way that the movie would capture even half of Robbins' magic, but after seeing the movie, it made me never want to read the book again. The movie Even Cowgirls Get the Blues doesn't include an eighth of the content in the book, and it seems to focus more on the love connection between Bonanza Jellybean and Sissy than anything else. Along with the incredibly weak plot line in the movie, I think that better actors definitely could have been chosen to play the characters. The only actors in the movie that I thought played their roles fit to Robbins' descriptions in the book were Julian's friends, in their five minute clip in the beginning of the movie. Those who haven't read the book might enjoy the movie, but as a huge Tom Robbins fan, this movie was nothing but a

{"value":"I had been looking forward to seeing this film for a long time, after seeing \"Return to Paradise,\" which I found to be gritty. I was so disappointed. The most realistic thing about it was the unpredictable ending which I think was partly stolen from \"Return to Paradise.\" <br /><br />Maybe I was expecting too much. <br /><br />On the positive side Danes, Beckinsale and Pullman were fantastic in their roles. Although I didnt like Danes's character and first and found her very annoying. <br /><br />I couldnt see anything realistic about the film. It could of been done so much better, for example there could of been more emphasis on the prison conditions and the sheer horror. It was too cheery a movie to be realistic. There could also of been more action and tension<br /><br />The best thing about this film is the \"tragic\" ending. I couldnt of predicted that.

{"value":"This is the kind of movie which shows the paucity of French cinema when it comes to making thrillers.The director's desire to \"sound American\" is so glaring that you will not be fooled a minute,unless you have not seen a serial killer movie since \"Peeping Tom\".<br /><br />Two male cops (or one and a half,more like,as you will see),horrible murders,a plot more complicated than complex.Charles Berling is not lucky with the genre(see the astoundlingly dumb \"l'inconnu de Strasbourg\" a couple of years ago).The scenes with his pregnant wife -which are supposed to be a counterpart for the otherwise noir atmosphere of the rest of the plot-are among the worst ever filmed.Add a steamy love scene between them and a gory autopsy to get a PG 12 and thus to attract the huge adolescent audience.A violent and absurd conclusion,followed by a silent epilogue who could make a nice commercial for the côte d'azur,it's really the silence of the
