{"value":"When this cartoon first aired I was under the impression that it would be at least half way descent, boy was I wrong. I must admit watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching Batman and Robin with George Clooney all those years ago. I watched a few episodes and two of them had Batman literally get his ass kicked left and right by the Penguin who fought like Jet Li and beat the crap out of Batman and I watched another episode where Batman got his butt kicked again by the Joker, who apparently was using Jackie Chan moves while flipping in the air like a ninja. Since when were the Joker or the Penguin ever a match for Batman ? and worse yet when were Joker and Penguin Kung Fu counterparts of Jackie Chan and Jet Li. It's truly embarrassing, depressing and sad the way the image of Batman is portrayed in this show. The animation is awful and the dialog is terrible. Being a Batman fan since my boyhood I can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all cost, because it doesn't project the true image of Batman. This cartoon is more like a wannabe Kung Fu Flick and if you really wanna see a classic Batman cartoon I strongly recommend Batman the Animated Series, but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of S---T! Get Batman: The Animates Series and don't waste your time with this cartoon.","finished_norm":["when","thi","cartoon","air","i","be","under","the","impress","that","it","would","be","at","littl","half","wai","descent","boi","be","i","wrong","i","must","admit","watch","thi","cartoon","be","almost","a","pain","a","watch","batman","and","robin","with","georg","cloonei","all","that","year","ago","i","watch","a","few","episod","and","two","of","them","have","batman","liter","get","hi","ass","kick","leav","and","right","by","the","penguin","who","fight","like","jet","li","and","beat","the","crap","out","of","batman","and","i","watch","anoth","episod","where","batman","get","hi","butt","kick","again","by","the","joker","who","appar","be","us","jacki","chan","move","while","flip","in","the","air","like","a","ninja","sinc","when","be","the","joker","or","the","penguin","ever","a","match","for","batman","and","wrong","yet","when","be","joker","and","penguin","kung","fu","counterpart","of","jacki","chan","and","jet","li","it","truli","embarrass","depress","and","sad","the","wai","the","imag","of","batman","be","portrai","in","thi","show","the","anim","be","aw","and","the","dialog","be","terribl","be","a","batman","fan","sinc","my","boyhood","i","can","honestli","and","strongli","advis","you","to","stai","awai","and","avoid","thi","show","at","all","cost","becaus","it","doe","not","project","the","true","imag","of","batman","thi","cartoon","be","much","like","a","wannab","kung","fu","flick","and","if","you","realli","wanna","see","a","classic","batman","cartoon","i","strongli","recommend","batman","the","anim","seri","but","thi","cartoon","be","noth","much","than","a","piec","of","st","get","batman","the","anim","seri","and","do","not","wast","your","time","with","thi","cartoon"],"filtered":["thi","cartoon","air","impress","littl","half","wai","descent","boi","wrong","must","admit","watch","thi","cartoon","almost","pain","watch","batman","robin","georg","cloonei","year","ago","watch","episod","two","batman","liter","get","hi","ass","kick","leav","right","penguin","fight","like","jet","li","beat","crap","batman","watch","anoth","episod","batman","get","hi","butt","kick","joker","appar","us","jacki","chan","move","flip","air","like","ninja","sinc","joker","penguin","ever","match","batman","wrong","yet","joker","penguin","kung","fu","counterpart","jacki","chan","jet","li","truli","embarrass","depress","sad","wai","imag","batman","portrai","thi","show","anim","aw","dialog","terribl","batman","fan","sinc","boyhood","honestli","strongli","advis","stai","awai","avoid","thi","show","cost","becaus","doe","project","true","imag","batman","thi","cartoon","much","like","wannab","kung","fu","flick","realli","wanna","see","classic","batman","cartoon","strongli","recommend","batman","anim","seri","thi","cartoon","noth","much","piec","st","get","batman","anim","seri","wast","time","thi","cartoon"],"filtered2":["cartoon","air","impress","littl","half","wai","descent","boi","wrong","must","admit","watch","cartoon","almost","pain","watch","batman","robin","georg","cloonei","year","ago","watch","two","batman","liter","get","ass","kick","leav","right","penguin","fight","like","jet","li","beat","crap","batman","watch","anoth","batman","get","butt","kick","joker","appar","us","jacki","chan","move","flip","air","like","ninja","sinc","joker","penguin","ever","match","batman","wrong","yet","joker","penguin","kung","fu","counterpart","jacki","chan","jet","li","truli","embarrass","depress","sad","wai","imag","batman","portrai","show","anim","aw","dialog","terribl","batman","fan","sinc","boyhood","honestli","strongli","advis","stai","awai","avoid","show","cost","becaus","doe","project","true","imag","batman","cartoon","like","wannab","kung","fu","flick","realli","wanna","see","classic","batman","cartoon","strongli","recommend","batman","anim","cartoon","noth","piec","st","get","batman","anim","wast","time","cartoon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,7,8,13,14,18,22,25,28,33,44,47,49,56,57,73,74,89,121,131,138,140,141,155,162,166,194,206,218,232,257,275,277,282,298,304,308,313,332,335,343,365,418,432,455,459,469,557,610,653,660,678,679,680,691,740,757,837,869,897,919,1075,1086,1127,1627,1661,1920,2018,2043,2225,2260,2429,2434,2502,2869,3097,3419,3440,3706,3724,3762,4467,5129,5144],"values":[3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,7,8,13,14,18,22,25,28,33,44,47,49,56,57,73,74,89,121,131,138,140,141,155,162,166,194,206,218,232,257,275,277,282,298,304,308,313,332,335,343,365,418,432,455,459,469,557,610,653,660,678,679,680,691,740,757,837,869,897,919,1075,1086,1127,1627,1661,1920,2018,2043,2225,2260,2429,2434,2502,2869,3097,3419,3440,3706,3724,3762,

{"value":"Shocking!<br /><br />In 1965 I saw Jury Gagarin alive. He was sincere, unpretentious and kindly, he was at ease and looked like well-educated and intellectual person. In this movie I saw a clown! The actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry. They made a cartoon! The real Gagarin was someone else! Don't believe in this movie!<br /><br />I saw this movie after the movies like \"Taming of Fire\" and \"Apollo 13\" and after reading books \"Rockets and People\" by Chertok and \"Korolev: Myths and Facts\" by Golovanov. I was shocked by tiresome scenario, poor acting and producing, and a lots of inexactitudes of \"Space Race\".<br /><br />The movie is the tedious rendering of well-known in Russia historical facts. A lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated. Some facts and details were perverted. For example, in 1945 Korolev was already not a prisoner (liberated in 1944), and in 1940 he was already not in Kolyma prison gold mine, but in special prison design bureau. Korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners. But in the movie Korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 (because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform). IMHO, the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can't to make interesting movies.","finished_norm":["shockingbr","br","in","i","see","juri","gagarin","aliv","he","be","sincer","unpretenti","and","kindli","he","be","at","eas","and","look","like","welleduc","and","intellectu","person","in","thi","movi","i","see","a","clown","the","actor","look","like","dummi","with","affect","gestur","and","mimicri","thei","make","a","cartoon","the","real","gagarin","be","someon","els","do","not","believ","in","thi","moviebr","br","i","see","thi","movi","after","the","movi","like","tame","of","fire","and","apollo","and","after","read","book","rocket","and","peopl","by","chertok","and","korolev","myth","and","fact","by","golovanov","i","be","shock","by","tiresom","scenario","poor","act","and","produc","and","a","lot","of","inexactitud","of","space","racebr","br","the","movi","be","the","tediou","render","of","wellknown","in","russia","histor","fact","a","lot","of","interest","know","fact","of","the","space","project","be","not","demonstr","some","fact","and","detail","be","pervert","for","exampl","in","korolev","be","alreadi","not","a","prison","liber","in","and","in","he","be","alreadi","not","in","kolyma","prison","gold","mine","but","in","special","prison","design","bureau","korolev","be","the","design","in","prison","design","bureau","and","he","be","not","buri","the","dead","prison","but","in","the","movi","korolev","work","a","grave","digger","after","becaus","jailer","have","shoulder","strap","on","uniform","imho","the","author","of","movi","have","no","profound","knowledg","about","thi","part","of","the","histori","and","thei","ca","not","to","make","interest","movi"],"filtered":["shockingbr","br","see","juri","gagarin","aliv","sincer","unpretenti","kindli","eas","look","like","welleduc","intellectu","person","thi","movi","see","clown","actor","look","like","dummi","affect","gestur","mimicri","thei","make","cartoon","real","gagarin","someon","els","believ","thi","moviebr","br","see","thi","movi","movi","like","tame","fire","apollo","read","book","rocket","peopl","chertok","korolev","myth","fact","golovanov","shock","tiresom","scenario","poor","act","produc","lot","inexactitud","space","racebr","br","movi","tediou","render","wellknown","russia","histor","fact","lot","interest","know","fact","space","project","demonstr","fact","detail","pervert","exampl","korolev","alreadi","prison","liber","alreadi","kolyma","prison","gold","mine","special","prison","design","bureau","korolev","design","prison","design","bureau","buri","dead","prison","movi","korolev","work","grave","digger","becaus","jailer","shoulder","strap","uniform","imho","author","movi","profound","knowledg","thi","part","histori","thei","ca","make","interest","movi"],"filtered2":["shockingbr","see","juri","gagarin","aliv","sincer","unpretenti","kindli","eas","look","like","welleduc","intellectu","person","see","clown","actor","look","like","dummi","affect","gestur","mimicri","make","cartoon","real","gagarin","someon","els","believ","moviebr","see","like","tame","fire","apollo","read","book","rocket","peopl","chertok","korolev","myth","fact","golovanov","shock","tiresom","scenario","poor","act","produc","lot","inexactitud","space","racebr","tediou","render","wellknown","russia","histor","fact","lot","interest","know","fact","space","project","demonstr","fact","detail","pervert","exampl","korolev","alreadi","prison","liber","alreadi","kolyma","prison","gold","mine","special","prison","design","bureau","korolev","design","prison","design","bureau","buri","dead","prison","korolev","work","grave","digger","becaus","jailer","shoulder","strap","uniform","imho","author","profound","knowledg","part","histori","ca","make","interest"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,16,21,22,23,26,41,48,60,61,72,80,81,91,97,139,145,146,151,153,196,203,228,261,307,330,465,499,508,551,637,653,660,681,741,852,953,1048,1112,1235,1444,1569,1580,1631,1702,1767,1802,1815,1849,1887,2216,2257,2294,2377,2388,2446,2714,2790,3414,3433,3686,3763,3771,3888,4376,4709,4847,5706,6011,6685,7223],"values":[2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,16,21,22,23,26,41,48,60,61,72,80,81,91,97,139,145,146,151,153,196,203,228,261,307,330,465,499,508,551,637,653,660,681,741,852,953,1048,1112,1235,1444,1569,1580,1631,1702,1767,1802,1815,1849,1887,2216,2257,2294,2377,2388,2446,2714,2790,3414,3433,3686,3763,3771,3888,4376,4709,4847,5706,6011,6685,7223],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.9381148836729736,1.967100616408184,2.393227744058217,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,3.676353282473182,1.8818517047392527,3.841892750832105,1.9951803900462557,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,8.218223169849034,2.

{"value":"Im proud to say I've seen all three Fast and Furious films.Sure,the plots are kinda silly,and they might be a little cheesy,but I love them car chases,and all the beautiful cars,and the clandestine midnight races.And Ill gladly see a fourth one.<br /><br />Wanna know what the difference is between those three and Redline?Decent acting,somewhat thought out plot,even if they are potboilers,and last but not least,directors who have a clue.All three were made by very competent directors,all of them took the films in a different direction,equally exciting.Redline looks like the producer picked out a dozen women he slept with on the casting couch,and made them the extras,then picked up his leads from Hollywood's unemployment line.And the script.Yikes.Its Mystery Science Theatre 3000 bad.This is 70's made for TV movie bad.<br /><br />Yeah,the movie had a few cool cars,but you don't really get to see that many in action,and the action is directed so poorly you cant get excited by the chases,and if the cars aren't thrilling you,why go to a movie like this?<br /><br />Im in the audience with a bunch of teenagers,and I cant stop laughing out loud.Im getting dirty

{"value":"Let's see...I'm trying to practice finding the positive in everything, so what kind thing can I say about the Pallbearer?<br /><br />I know! The performances were -- no, that won't work as they succeeded in draining all personality from Gwyneth Paltrow, usually so vibrant, and ended up creating caricatures out of Carol Kane and Barbara Hershey...<br /><br />Oh - how 'bout the story -- nope. That isn't gonna fly either, as it was doze-inducing. What was the genre anyway? It wasn't funny, that rules out comedy. It wasn't interesting enough to be dramatic. Was that a romance between Schwimmer and Paltrow? I have to ask, as I can't be sure - let's just call it \"losers in like.\" I'm sure those behind this film started with a vision, I mean, they must have had one to pitch to the studio suits, but I need help finding it.<br /><br />Even if I were a patient person who could forgive the pure stupidity of the story, I couldn't in good conscience recommend a film that allows a guy to go into a professional job interview in a windbreaker and messy, fluffy, stupid hair. Speaking of hair -- are we supposed to be amused by the deliberate black roots and platinum locks worn by Hershey?<br /><br />What am I doing?

{"value":"Primal Species comes from B Movie legend Roger Corman and as such everybody who watches this needs to realise that this is a Low Budget B Movie and it knows it.<br /><br />A bunch of terrorists high-jack a Lorry and kill an entire army doing so, they believe it to hold uranium, but No..... It contains two Dino's with a taste for Human Flesh... Then a Crack team, who might as well be called Delta Force get called in.<br /><br />OK, This ain't Jurassic Park, and Yes The Dino's are never clearly seen because it's obviously a guy in a Costume that's not too dissimilar to Barney the Dinosaur - only slightly LESS terrifying,but come on guys this had about 1% of Jurassic Park's Budget and as such does what it can.<br /><br />Does this deserve to be in the bottom 100?....HELL NO!!! I think the nearly half of voters who give this a 1 - are being WAY WAY overly harsh, it's much closer to a 4... it's actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the Bottom 100, and has a similar production value to a Sci-Fi Channel Production.

{"value":"Nothing to say but Wow! Has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field? Well this happens about 25 times in this movie(clearly the directors' favorite scare tactic). In one of the opening scenes the smooth talking/hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film. Shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and, although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute. After about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown's history in which we see some of his previous victims. If you watch this movie check out the ladies chest.. her ribs go all the way to her neck, it was flat out disgusting. Most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day. The few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors backyard. The movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically.<br /><br />Definitely RENT THIS

{"value":"Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court. Okay, that sounds all right there. It leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story. But no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film. This movie became redundant, retarded, and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by. Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite t.v. characters, Woody from Cheers, and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie. But after seeing his \" acting performance \" I have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend. His acting was as dull and poor as the movie. Another actor in this unreal film was Rosie Perez. I have liked movies with Perez before, but I have decided that the reason I have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didn't have that many speaking lines ( Do the Right Thing ). But now in White Men Can't Jump she was made a central character with many lines, thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice. So after seeing this film ( term used loosely ) and hearing Rosie Perez for much more than appreciated I can now say that I'm a white man and I'm getting ready to jump . . . off a twenty story

{"value":"For years I remember reading about this show \"Trouble With Tracy\" in the TV Guide. CFTO-TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 am! I lived about a two-hour drive north of Toronto and we couldn't get CFTO, but you know how it is - we always want what we can't have.<br /><br />Well, I knew what I wanted and what I wanted was to see what this \"Trouble With Tracy\" was all about. Did it have a beautiful girl in the starring role? Was there nudity? Was there suspense? Was it a comedy? It would've been fine if there was some promotion of the show. At least I could've known what I was missing. But, NO! The mystery drove me bonkers, until CTV affiliate CKCO built a re-transmitter in Wiarton, Ontario and began to broadcast \"Trouble With Tracy\" at the same time as CFTO....Saturday mornings at 6 am!! One Saturday morning I got up and turned the TV on at 5:59 and at last I got to see what \"The Trouble With Tracy\" was. Yes, the \"Trouble With Tracy\" was that it was Canadian content and stuck in the harmless 6 am spot so no one would ever see how awful it was.<br /><br />Talented Canadian Actor Steve Weston died a few years afterward, but many would argue he effectively \"died\" the first time he appeared on this show. When I saw it for the first time that cold Saturday morning and fell despondent back into my bed, part of me died, too.","finished_norm":["for","year","i","rememb","read","about","thi","show","troubl","with","traci","in","the","tv","guid","cftotv","toronto","everi","saturdai","morn","at","be","i","live","about","a","twohour","drive","north","of","toronto","and","we","can","not","get","cfto","but","you","know","how","it","be","we","alwai","want","what","we","ca","not","havebr","br","good","i","know","what","i","want","and","what","i","want","be","to","see","what","thi","troubl","with","traci","be","all","about","do","it","have","a","beauti","girl","in","the","star","role","be","there","nuditi","be","there","suspens","be","it","a","comedi","it","would","have","be","fine","if","there","be","some","promot","of","the","show","at","littl","i","can","have","know","what","i","be","miss","but","no","the","mysteri","drive","me","bonker","until","ctv","affili","ckco","build","a","retransmitt","in","wiarton","ontario","and","begin","to","broadcast","troubl","with","traci","at","the","same","time","a","cftosaturdai","morn","at","be","on","saturdai","morn","i","get","up","and","turn","the","tv","on","at","and","at","last","i","get","to","see","what","the","troubl","with","traci","be","ye","the","troubl","with","traci","be","that","it","be","canadian","content","and","stick","in","the","harmless","be","spot","so","no","on","would","ever","see","how","aw","it","wasbr","br","talent","canadian","actor","steve","weston","die","a","few","year","afterward","but","mani","would","argu","he","effect","die","the","time","he","appear","on","thi","show","when","i","see","it","for","the","time","that","cold","saturdai","morn","and","fall","despond","back","into","my","bed","part","of","me","die","too"],"filtered":["year","rememb","read","thi","show","troubl","traci","tv","guid","cftotv","toronto","everi","saturdai","morn","live","twohour","drive","north","toronto","get","cfto","know","alwai","want","ca","havebr","br","good","know","want","want","see","thi","troubl","traci","beauti","girl","star","role","nuditi","suspens","comedi","fine","promot","show","littl","know","miss","mysteri","drive","bonker","ctv","affili","ckco","build","retransmitt","wiarton","ontario","begin","broadcast","troubl","traci","time","cftosaturdai","morn","saturdai","morn","get","turn","tv","last","get","see","troubl","traci","ye","troubl","traci","canadian","content","stick","harmless","spot","ever","see","aw","wasbr","br","talent","canadian","actor","steve","weston","die","year","afterward","mani","argu","effect","die","time","appear","thi","show","see","time","cold","saturdai","morn","fall","despond","back","bed","part","die"],"filtered2":["year","rememb","read","show","troubl","traci","tv","guid","cftotv","toronto","everi","saturdai","morn","live","twohour","drive","north","toronto","get","cfto","know","alwai","want","ca","havebr","good","know","want","want","see","troubl","traci","beauti","girl","star","role","nuditi","suspens","comedi","fine","promot","show","littl","know","miss","mysteri","drive","bonker","ctv","affili","ckco","build","retransmitt","wiarton","ontario","begin","broadcast","troubl","traci","time","cftosaturdai","morn","saturdai","morn","get","turn","tv","last","get","see","troubl","traci","ye","troubl","traci","canadian","content","stick","harmless","spot","ever","see","aw","wasbr","talent","canadian","actor","steve","weston","die","year","afterward","mani","argu","effect","die","time","appear","show","see","time","cold","saturdai","morn","fall","despond","back","bed","part","die"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,8,14,26,28,37,41,44,50,57,61,63,81,84,85,96,100,106,116,127,128,138,144,145,147,169,170,172,197,209,255,276,290,293,325,403,416,461,464,477,529,612,752,1006,1065,1105,1107,1142,1477,1695,1793,1811,1884,2161,2246,2447,2494,2723,2936,4112,4922,6859,8487],"values":[4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,8,14,26,28,37,41,44,50,57,61,63,81,84,85,96,100,106,116,127,128,138,144,145,147,169,170,172,197,209,255,276,290,293,325,403,416,461,464,477,529,612,752,1006,1065,1105,1107,1142,1477,1695,1793,1811,1884,2161,2246,2447,2494,2723,2936,4112,4922,6859,8487],"values":[2.6228008218775787,0.6786144649922705,2.389902141215977,2.825681057716235,1.1175081997259209,3.9974772509130565,4.635688258055728,4.4629629644322915,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.717994385570355,3.668325173349496,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,1.949757232424728,2.2212694515902225,2.011190219103739,2.0390708128715254,2.1405462403177813,2.159084361316692,2.2466628996789315,2.4359679371086367,2.3409902041158843,2.2907365189289424,2.2931108769894046,2.34599021453259,2.2844323215331563,2.4214486257841834,2.4071371113909277,5.000281788719697,2.558331832813986,2.6026896854443837,2.675469415662

{"value":"I would list this film under the horror film genre.I did this because I am not aware of a genre called horrible. Since the genre horror comes the nearest to horrible I have decided to put it in this category. The acting was amateurish. You know who the villains would be at the first scene. The heroine is as ugly as the movie. Students of movie making should take this movie as an example for the lesson what not to do in a movie. It is that bad. Man the word bad is an understatement. The villains hijack an ocean liner and want 10 million dollars. They want the money to be delivered on an inhabited Rose Island in the middle of the pacific. They would be sitting ducks after they got the money. Is there no getaway plan. How dumb. The female Cruise Director is a former cop, navy seal, kung fu I am scared. The hilarious part is the way the defuses the time bomb. He says he knows what he is doing and he keeps pulling all the wires one by one. He then puts it in his pocket and according to the movie with all the connections in place. Is he mad? As mad us who watched this RIDICULOUS. If you have a M-i-L whom you do not like. To annoy her rent this movie and pretend you enjoy it.

{"value":"A pot - boiler if ever I saw one. A supposed thriller borrowing from \"A Time to Kill\", \"Silence of the Lambs\", even an inverted \"In the Heat of the Night\" with a little reverse murder, a la \"Strangers on a Train\" thrown in, it fails abysmally where all the above, to a large degree, succeeded. Namely, in delivering thrills. The plot seems condensed from a bigger book, making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving, while the direction lacks pace and verve. To rein in any kudos, a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too. Connery is clearly slowing down in his old age, barely bothering with his attempt at a US accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of Hope Lange and the father of those gosh - darn kids of his. He even has a father in law who seems younger than him. Laurence Fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you're confused from the outset as to whether he's a bad guy or a good guy. Someone once said that flashbacks shouldn't lie - they do, confusedly, here. The rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles. The supposed climax managed too, to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back, not as should have been the aim, front edge of my seat.

{"value":"This film comes as the ultimate disappointment in Tsai Ming-Liang for me. It oozes laziness from its every frame. So I'm not going to analyse it thoroughly either. But some observations:<br /><br />1. If the premise is drought, why we get to see city landscapes with blooming green trees? I wonder if that was supposed to mean something in the metaphorical context of the film (in which thirst notifies the craving for intimacy, and watermelon the trivial substitute, sex). Or it is only a matter of lousy film-making, not giving a damn about being coherent.<br /><br />2. We don't get to know what had happened to the porn actress, why she is unconscious or, presumably, dead. It seems a question of no importance as long as the message of supreme alienation is successfully (=bombastically) delivered, but in retrospect, her inert body proves to be a cheap dramaturgical gimmick, a pretext  just as gratuitous and exploitative as the activity it is employed in.<br /><br />3. Nothing is expressed in this movie that Antonioni hadn't expressed better 40 years ago  and without needlessly humiliating his actors.<br /><br />4. The musical numbers (recycled from 'The Hole') felt like a secondary-schooler's idea of artistic counterpointing, executed on that very secondary-school level of skill. If that was the point, the point

{"value":"I didn't expect much from this film, but oh brother, what a stinker.<br /><br />I found this gem in a giant crate of awful $5 DVD's at Walmart (where else)? As cheap as this disc was, I feel ripped off. The special effects had a high school look to them, the camera work marred by wobbly tripods and sketchy lighting and the acting was a perfect example of the 'Christian School'. One can imagine the long and exhausting 'prayer meetings' by the production company after seeing the rushes come back - the people who bankrolled this thing must have had seriously anti-biblical feelings towards the inept production company that cranked this thing out. Think of their anguish as they saw their $914.86 investment go up in smoke.<br /><br />Someone asked why Christian movies are so bad - perhaps the Xian film-makers need to look at GOOD movies and attempt to copy some of the things that make them so good. Believable stories and characters, less hysterical arm-waving and fanaticism, oh, and a story that appeals to -everyone-, not just true believers. I.e. Stop The Sermon, Save It For Church. Take the Omen or Prophesy series, for example. Excellent films with compelling story lines, great cinematography and intense music. No hysterical arm-waving.

{"value":"I rented this movie on the merits of what the trailer showed, and of course Sir Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />If Jackson Pollack teamed up with David Lynch, and Timothy Leary to make a movie, this would be the end result. I don't think I've seen a movie like it that made an LSD trip look like an episode of Sesame Street.<br /><br />It's a bunch of set pieces where the characters flash in and out of reality, or various realities, and the film doesn't culminate into anything until the last 5 minutes, where all of a sudden it makes sense. I wrote a scathing review on my movie review blog that essentially gives everything away, and I won't do that here. It's a well acted piece of cinema, and the soundtrack was written by Sir Anthony Hopkins, and let me say this, if there's one redeeming feature to this film, it's the music. It fits perfectly. Some of the dialogue is unbelievably good, and unbelievably bad all at the same time.<br /><br />I enjoyed parts of this movie, I truly did, and once you get to the end of it, you'll actually figure out what's truly going on. It's unfortunate that you have to wade through 2 hours of crazy to get to a salient point, which minimizes the effect of the entire movie.<br /><br />I give it a 3 out of 10 for the simple fact that the real problem with this film isn't the acting, it's everything.","finished_norm":["i","rent","thi","movi","on","the","merit","of","what","the","trailer","show","and","of","cours","sir","anthoni","hopkinsbr","br","if","jackson","pollack","team","up","with","david","lynch","and","timothi","leari","to","make","a","movi","thi","would","be","the","end","result","i","do","not","think","i","have","see","a","movi","like","it","that","make","a","lsd","trip","look","like","a","episod","of","sesam","streetbr","br","it","a","bunch","of","set","piec","where","the","charact","flash","in","and","out","of","realiti","or","variou","realiti","and","the","film","doe","not","culmin","into","anyth","until","the","last","minut","where","all","of","a","sudden","it","make","sens","i","write","a","scath","review","on","my","movi","review","blog","that","essenti","give","everyth","awai","and","i","wo","not","do","that","here","it","a","good","act","piec","of","cinema","and","the","soundtrack","be","write","by","sir","anthoni","hopkin","and","let","me","sai","thi","if","there","on","redeem","featur","to","thi","film","it","the","music","it","fit","perfectli","some","of","the","dialogu","be","unbeliev","good","and","unbeliev","bad","all","at","the","same","timebr","br","i","enjoi","part","of","thi","movi","i","truli","do","and","onc","you","get","to","the","end","of","it","you","will","actual","figur","out","what","truli","go","on","it","unfortun","that","you","have","to","wade","through","hour","of","crazi","to","get","to","a","salient","point","which","minim","the","effect","of","the","entir","moviebr","br","i","give","it","a","out","of","for","the","simpl","fact","that","the","real","problem","with","thi","film","be","not","the","act","it","everyth"],"filtered":["rent","thi","movi","merit","trailer","show","cours","sir","anthoni","hopkinsbr","br","jackson","pollack","team","david","lynch","timothi","leari","make","movi","thi","end","result","think","see","movi","like","make","lsd","trip","look","like","episod","sesam","streetbr","br","bunch","set","piec","charact","flash","realiti","variou","realiti","film","doe","culmin","anyth","last","minut","sudden","make","sens","write","scath","review","movi","review","blog","essenti","give","everyth","awai","wo","good","act","piec","cinema","soundtrack","write","sir","anthoni","hopkin","let","sai","thi","redeem","featur","thi","film","music","fit","perfectli","dialogu","unbeliev","good","unbeliev","bad","timebr","br","enjoi","part","thi","movi","truli","onc","get","end","actual","figur","truli","go","unfortun","wade","hour","crazi","get","salient","point","minim","effect","entir","moviebr","br","give","simpl","fact","real","problem","thi","film","act","everyth"],"filtered2":["rent","merit","trailer","show","cours","sir","anthoni","hopkinsbr","jackson","pollack","team","david","lynch","timothi","leari","make","end","result","think","see","like","make","lsd","trip","look","like","sesam","streetbr","bunch","set","piec","charact","flash","realiti","variou","realiti","doe","culmin","anyth","last","minut","sudden","make","sens","write","scath","review","review","blog","essenti","give","everyth","awai","wo","good","act","piec","cinema","soundtrack","write","sir","anthoni","hopkin","let","redeem","featur","music","fit","perfectli","dialogu","unbeliev","good","unbeliev","bad","timebr","enjoi","part","truli","onc","get","end","actual","figur","truli","go","unfortun","wade","hour","crazi","get","salient","point","minim","effect","entir","moviebr","give","simpl","fact","real","problem","act","everyth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,9,10,12,16,18,21,24,28,30,52,59,61,65,66,80,97,104,106,109,118,124,144,155,167,173,174,176,193,198,199,200,218,227,236,248,305,343,406,409,415,419,447,465,571,634,656,661,675,676,712,723,737,796,942,950,1043,1197,1250,1455,1475,1657,1693,1710,1786,1807,2067,2913,3172,3689,4731,6209,6275,6868,7259,7664],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,9,10,12,16,18,21,24,28,30,52,59,61,65,66,80,97,104,106,109,118,124,144,155,167,173,174,176,193,198,199,200,218,227,236,248,305,343,406,409,415,419,447,465,571,634,656,661,675,676,712,723,737,796,942,950,1043,1197,1250,1455,1475,1657,1693,1710,1786,1807,2067,2913,3172,3689,4731,6209,6275,6868,7259,7664],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,2.324031090670098,2.6420723132238515,1.5452294193519092,2.6728839783437044,1.7122153074726136,1.8693254449200722,1.8818517047392527,3.8147700134888347,1.929723173391612,1.9951803900462557,2.05455579246225

{"value":"This movie is simply far too long, far too repetitive, with the male nudity and sexuality being (as this is said as a gay with my own collection of adult titles) far too gratuitous and unnecessary. Much of the first third of the movie could have been cut down to ten minutes and been equally as effective without trying the patience (and stamina) of an audience.<br /><br />I saw this movie on an early Saturday afternoon, with a film festival audience; the type of crowd that tends to be more adventuresome, interested in more experimental or atypical films, such as one without much dialog, shorts, foreign films. The near sell out crowd in an approximate 275 seat theater started to dribble out within the first half of the movie and while the great majority did stay for the \"pay off\" (which never actually arrived), I have never, in about 14 years of attending any number of film festivals, experimental, gay and otherwise, seen such a large number of people walk away from a film. <br /><br />This movie could easily have been cut down by more than half and been as effective as it was.

{"value":"If I only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor, enough film for only one take of each shot, and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes, and was forced to make an over-2-hour movie about the French Revolution, and also didn't have any sets and had to have my 4-year-old autistic son paint the backgrounds, and also the only actors I could find were the people who didn't make the auditions of that year's soap opera, and I was also forced to not use any music in the entire film, and also the zoom function on the camera didn't work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and couldn't stop, oh and if I hated my audience, then I might make something kind of like this awful, yet mistakenly hilarious, Hell-worthy waste of time. The almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of George Lucas' latest creations, which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie, there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duel/space laser battle. I don't mean to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, but that's not how it ends. The only thing I can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review.

{"value":"With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie you figure this one won't go wrong. But what can I say? This was a horrible misfire. The movie is about Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is incredibly disjointed and I did not understand anything about it. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove it.<br /><br />That song about arabella Cinderella' is pretty cool, but that is it. I only recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie, this is almost the definition of one. I guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of it's definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality, the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing, not to mention the direction is just so out there. <br /><br />Peter Sellers in particular is very hit and miss, he will go from Dr. Strangelove and Being There throughout his career, to dumb movies like this and the Magic Christian, which was very similar to this one in context and style, but that movie did have a few funny moments. This one is senseless, and I am sad that someone as great as Peter Sellers was in this movie.

{"value":"the IMDb guidelines state that you have to declare if your comments contain 'spoilers'. <br /><br />well, this whole film is something of a spoiler... a cautionary tale that glorifies what it cautions against, a tale of lost youth that doesn't know where it itself is going.<br /><br />i just saw this at the tribeca film festival. this film wasn't just bad, it was really bad.<br /><br />the acting is inconsistent, the characters are the mostly cliché offerings with little depth, and farnsworth's acting was very bad in particular.<br /><br />from the patronizing accents to the pointless plot line to the out of place 'graphic' elements to the repetitious dialog and scenarios... it sucked the big one. <br /><br />i think he was looking for sort of a more edgy, updated 'drugstore cowboy' with a touch of 'natural born killers' but it is no where as sensitive to the characters as the former and no where as shocking (outside of some frat-level gore) as the ladder. <br /><br />more than anything, someone needed to really A) edit the screenplay <br /><br />(there are some things in there to build on and clearly <br /><br />deals with a worthy subject... if ham-handed in it's attempt.)

{"value":"Wenders was great with Million $ Hotel.I don't know how he came up with this film! The idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of American Society is hopeful,that makes it 2 out of ten.But this is not a movie.Is that the best someone can do with a great idea(the west-east clash).There are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a MAC* with the fingers of an Amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity(because she is just ignorant about the facts).The characters are not well shaped.And the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me.At the ending scene Lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen.And the background music says \"...I will pray\".The thing is not about religion actually.But it ends up with this.How you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray.The lights are already shining on the truth.Its just that nobody wants to see it. ps: \"My home is not a place.It is people\"The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence.But it is wasted behind this film making.

{"value":"I remember the days in which Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb Blondie,romantic interest or damsel in danger.But,everything changed when she won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent movie L.A. Confidential,and I think I was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance.However,after that moment,her career did not follow the ideal path.Sure,the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies (like People I Know or The Door in the Floor),but we have never seen her again on a substantial character.The movie While She Was Out does nothing to put her on that situation; and it is not only that her character is not too tasty,but also that the movie is really crappy.The screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic.However,Basinger brings some conviction to her character,and that makes this poor movie to win a few points.This movie is full of clichés and generic villains.The work of director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly,because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone.The ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous.I do not recommend While She Was Out at all.This

{"value":"Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining. So can Whoopi Goldberg movies. But Whoopi AND dinosaurs?<br /><br />After the first 20 minutes of \"Theodore Rex\", I had come to one conclusion: this movie is evil. Evil, vile, wicked and reprehensible in its spite for the audience. Nothing this bad is made by accident; this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber.<br /><br />First of all, Whoopi does not make good action movies (watch \"Fatal Beauty\" if you think I'm lying), but the film makers don't care - she's a tough cop here, yet again. <br /><br />Seen a million cop buddy flicks this week? Well, here's number one million and one, pal.<br /><br />Don't like cute, humanistic animated dinosaurs since that Spielberg TV show about them? Too bad, here's another one and he's a cop, too!<br /><br />You one of those people that hates car chases, shoot-outs, sloppy dialogue, boring futuristic FX and seeing talented people (Goldberg, Mueller-Stahl, Roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write-off? A BIG tax write-off?<br /><br />And you read this review all the way to the end. You DESERVE a sequel. Seriously.<br /><br />No stars, not a one.

{"value":"This is just one more of those hideous films that you find on Lifetime TV which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner. Along with other such nasty films as \"The Burning Bed,\" \"Enough,\" or \"Monster,\" this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she's not such a bad person after all. Give us a break! Here's my question to the filmmakers: If LeTourneau were a man, and Vili were a 12 year old girl, would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person? Answer: Hell no.<br /><br />Imagine switching the genders in this film, and then you'll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage. Were the genders switched, there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal. Instead, we'd likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl, his lascivious behavior landing him in prison, and his brainwashed victim suffering from Stockholm Syndrome. The only reason LeTourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex.<br /><br />Let's call a spade a spade. LeTourneau is a pedophile. Plain and simple. No ifs, ands or buts.

{"value":"This film was not nearly as much of a chore as I expected it to be. There are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore UFO conspiracy paranoia-fest. Most of the acting is mediocre, but fairly typical for 1970s-style stuff replete with pregnant pauses. A photographer and a model witness some strange goings-on in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goings-on. Flying saucers are spotted, more people disappear - but is it the aliens or our own government's ultra-secret group of cover-up guys? Soon enough, a reporter and a \"UFOlogist\" (apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director) are drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultra-secret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless. Then the fun really begins.<br /><br />The movie, predictably, makes about as much sense as the average UFO conspiracy theory, but should be commended for taking itself so seriously. The camera work is OK for a low-budget film, the pacing is pretty good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for. What are the few seconds of brilliance I mentioned? Honestly, I can't say much you without writing a spoiler.

{"value":"This movie makes Peter an elf in Robin Hood costume instead of a human boy in probably-not-Robin-Hood-costume and ignores all the persona features in him that really matter. This movie makes Wendy a babbling idiot. And poor Captain Hook a TOTAL clown. And of course as every Disney cartoon must have a character which has had too many hits in the head, they made one of the Lost Boys that one. The only character that has not been disgraced in this film is Tink. The only star is for her.<br /><br />The story itself then? The Darling parents don't even get the time to notice their kids are gone!!! Probably one of the most significant point in the original story and they ruined it! Also the famous nursery scene between Peter Pan and Wendy is a stunning piece of- There are no thimbles and no acorns - one of the little things that makes the original story such a unique one. It's a wonder he even had lost his shadow and she helped him stick it. (Even though to his shoes and it makes no sense to me.)<br /><br />Ruining a great story like this just to amuse children should be illegal. So know now if you haven't known it before - this Disney version does not have anything significant in common with the original story - which is not really a children's story but just a great, great

{"value":"Let me start off by saying I am not a fan of horror movies. I never watch them.<br /><br />Let me tell you about my experience...<br /><br />The only reason I watched this movie was because my girlfriend and her friends wanted to see it over Happy Feet.<br /><br />...I never saw Happy Feet, but I am sure it is better than this...movie? Anyway, we didn't actually expect it to be good...we actually went in just to laugh at it. Cool with me...I have a problem with ruining the movie for other people in the theater but since it was just other couples talking and making out, it did not matter.<br /><br />After 15 minutes the 2 other people left to go sneak into Borat, a movie I would have gladly seen again over this. The movie was not scary, and not stupid so it would be funny...it was just boring. It wasn't terrible like \"Baby Genuises\" terrible, it was terrible like...not entertaining at all. Avoid.<br /><br />Now I am no expert, but it seems the problem with the horror industry these days is that you can have a PG-13 horror that is boring and not scary, or you can have an R gruesome horror movie that either is too bloody or too disgusting for people.<br /><br />You want a PG-13 horror that sucks but is funny? See \"The Grudge.\" Avoid this movie like the plague...because it may literally bore you to death.<br /><br

{"value":"Protégé runs in a linear fashion; expect no fast-paced action, and neither will you find yourself with baited breath because there are simply no seating-on-the-edge moments.<br /><br />There is not much of a crux, so don't expect one either. I would not fault the acting - the show would have been much worst if not for Wu's acting which was the film's only saving grace. And, oh that cute little girl too.<br /><br />The humour is at best, weak, and the show must as well pass off as an anti-drug campaign which employs the usual shock-tactic (esp in the scenes with Zhang) to tell us stuff that we already know - i.e. drugs break up families, heroin drives you crazy, it is not so easy to wean off, you will fall into a vicious cycle.<br /><br />I know it may seem all a little harsh, but I feel that the show is far from seamless and somewhat patchy (*SPOILER ALERT*: Take for example when Andy Lau got brought to the police station: what? we were just told 'oh we have all the tapes and evidence against you since 1997', and THAT is how he got caught. Nope, no chasing-car action, just a jump-of-scene, which kind of undermined Wu's role as an undercover in the first place.) I suspect the lack of creativity is attributed to the fact that it is after all, a production of Mediacorp Raintree - a Singaporean production film

{"value":"Howling II (1985) was a complete 180 from the first film. Whilst the first film was campy and creepy. The second one was sleazy and cheesy. The production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious. The brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis'. The \"scene\" from the first film was badly re-created. A skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro' (Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to uncover the mystery to her sister's murder/transformation/death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage/guide to the two. Sybil Danning and her two biggest assets appear as Stirba, the head werewolf of the Romania. She also suffers from a bad case of morning face, ewww!<br /><br />Bad movie. There's nothing good about this stinker. I'm surprise Philippe Mora directed this picture because he's usually a good film-maker. The film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it (no, not the content but the film stock itself). To round the movie off you get a lousy \"punk\" performance from a Damned wannabe \"Babel\".

{"value":"Although nothing can compare to Vampires Vs. Zombies...in any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this movie.<br /><br />Firstly, the special effects were breath-taking. When there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode, and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me. Simply stunning my friends.<br /><br />But the scene when the Jack Black sound-a-like is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself, but don't worry since he was getting blazed in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on \"I must be high\". Seriously, he must have watched himself mindlessly babbling about non-congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be \"high\" to justify his awful acting. Well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers, directors, executive producers, sponsors you will probably get the same response...seriously.<br /><br />With a

You know why I am here even though I am a Naked Brothers Band hater? To warn people before they watch the dumb movie so that the NBB doesn't get any money from it so then they can't make any more amateur stupid songs that are so retarded that any old guy could go and write it in 10 seconds. Not only are the song lyrics retarded, they sing badly. Okay, I'm kinda getting off the movie here.....anyways, it was boring and they acted horribly. It was NOT funny at all even though they tried really hard for it to be. I guess they deserve some credit for that...well, the movie isn't worth your time. Just look at its rating.

Seriously, if you liked it, you need to go watch movies where the actors actually act, not babbling their lines in a monotone. I am on the drama club at my school and some people there are actually BETTER than those Nat and Alex guys. Hurry before it's too late! I seriously thought that Herbie Fully Loaded was better than this piece of poopie. I don't even know why I went through even HALF of that film.

{"value":"There's so many negative reviews about \"Stay away, Joe\" in here I just can't stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen. Here's a side you haven't heard yet.<br /><br />Elvis Presley's movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason: they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because I don't have to think when I watch them. That means I don't have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with. I can just kick off my shoes, grab a beer, sit back, switch off my brains and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easy-going rock n' roll tunes from the grooviest decade of them all.<br /><br />In my books \"Stay away, Joe\" definitely falls into the \"so bad it's good\"-category. Now if you're like me and appreciate \"the trash value\", this is the ultimate 1960's camp experience. It's so bad that it's almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it can't possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways. In the end you're so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just don't know whether to laugh or cry. In a nutshell: I love it because it's so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this. I still give it 1 out of 10 though - once it hits the bottom 100 it will became an instant bad movie

{"value":"Have you ever sat watching a movie when 20 or 30 minutes have gone by and suddenly you realize that you have actually seen the movie before? That happened to me with \"The Young Graduates\". The cover of the video box, if you can find the video, is extremely deceiving. I'd swear that the two women on the cover aren't even in the film.<br /><br />Anyway, I was either born a decade too late to appreciate the finer points of this film or...it is simply pointless junk. I'm heavily leaning toward the latter but I guess some out there have developed a connection to this movie.<br /><br />Hmm...plot. A plot. Let's see...there must be a plot around here somewhere. Nope, I can't find it. It's pretty much about some high school seniors acting dopey and doing drugs and speaking in a language that became outdated decades ago. One of the female students has a crush on her teacher. The teacher has a frigid wife (whom he indeed refers to as an iceberg) so he is receptive to the girl's advances.<br /><br />There's a lot of driving around and inane dialogue and plenty of spastic dancing. Our cat, BooBoo, was transfixed by the dancing high school kids. She watched with amazing intensity as the dancers gyrated and shook out on the dance floor. It's nice to see that at least one species has found something interesting in this relic.

{"value":"I ended up watching this movie before even going through any of the reviews, on the request of a female. Just out of curiosity, I thought, let me find out if there are people who actually recommend others to watch this movie. I am quite shocked to find such long and positive reviews on this website that makes me conclude that it's a scam.<br /><br />As far as my opinion goes, I have to ask,\"are these filmmakers retarded or do they assume that the viewers are retarded?\" The movie is atrocious on so many levels and I'm not even talking about the story or presentation.<br /><br />So, these bunch of guys plus one girl (the lead actress) form a Music band; guessing from the constant presence of guitars it is supposed to be a ROCK band. Hell, when did dancers started becoming the part of a Rock band??? Anyway, let me accept it as the-Bollywood-version-of-a- Rock-band, but amusingly enough all the scores which actually had these two guitarists doing all kinds of cool \"ROCK GESTURES\" and I am assuming they were playing the instruments, the sound of the guitar was completely missing!!!

{"value":"It's 1978, and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well! Fans will be upset and certainly the 75,000 seats will be full, only less happy there are so many black players on the field! This made for TV Super Bowl movie is watchable. It's not much more, but it's really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance (for the time), probably most notably Tom Selleck. Unfortunately any goodness Selleck brings to the screen, is quickly trumped by \"actors\" like Dick Butkus.<br /><br />It's a silly story about super bowl betting. PJ Jackson is charged by \"New York\" (read mafia) for ensuring the game ends for their favor, in this case a $10,000,000 bet. PJ is innocent enough, and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there. But things seem to fall apart for him. Another person, the unsuspected Lainie, takes charge. For a while, the mystery of murders isn't known for certain, but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that Lainie is the new antagonist.<br /><br />It's a bad movie, but is watchable. The acting is decent, and the filming is OK. At least there weren't any silly typical 70s car chases (they have their place just not here).
