{"value":"I gave this movie a very fair chance, and it betrayed me. This is very little more than a black and white excuse to bore the hell out of the audience even as the egotist Bogdanavich (who did way better with TARGETS) gets \"great performances\" out of a ton of hams in their debuts. Lots of teenage sex clichés come out of this movie, such as Doing the Teacher's Wife, Impotence, Doing the Ugly Prostitute(which is very awkwardly shot and grinds things to a complete halt, not that things were really going anywhere anyway) and skinny dipping.<br /><br />I suppose this movie is supposed to be funny because of all the sex nonsense, to me, it was just annoying. I was seriously much more entertained by cleaning my finger nails than watching this

Soon they're hunted down by a deranged chick who has some severe mental issues, and what ensues is 90 minutes of sheer boredom.<br /><br />I hope to never see any of these actors in any movie ever again. Their screaming, screeching voices gave me a headache, and the script was so poorly written that it included a lot of repeat phrases and nonsensical hysterical screaming. All in all, one of the worst cheap horror flicks I've ever seen...and I've seen a

Everybody accepts that there are Gay people in society just has there are other minority groups,but we don't want it ramming down our throats(i'll pass on this one) in every single show. Apart from the above, the drama went from what could have been an interesting little story into a pantomime,the priest was a paedophile and there are gays running about every where,oh yes just to be

{"value":"A scientist (John Carradine--sadly) finds out how to bring the dead back to life. However they come back with faces of marble. Eventually this all leads to disaster.<br /><br />Boring, totally predictable 1940s outing. This scared me silly when I was a kid but just bores me now. I had to struggle to stay awake! With one exception, the acting is horrible. Such expressionless boring actors! Hopeless.<br /><br />There are some good things about this: Carradine, despite the script, actually gives a very good performance. And there are a few mildly creepy moments involving a ghost of a Great Dane walking through walls. There's also one of the worst-looking knockouts in cinema history. Still, none of this is fun enough to sit through this.

Funny comments between the two teams, they tried but failed. Also, there are too may personalities they are following in this movie. This film should be about what is happening on the water, not on land. I am sorry to say that there is too far between the funny parts and the sponsors of the film are exploited to the max. No good. All in all, I give it four out of ten since it has some funny parts.","finished_norm":["okai","now","let","see","what","be","funni","in","the","movi","i","know","peopl","with","funni","accent","peopl","fall","into","the","water","silli","boat","crash","and","funni","comment","between","the","two","team","in","thi","movi","thei","have","twist","the","accent","part","to","the","max","no","good","a","whole","a","lot","of","peopl","be","fall","into","the","water","for","uncertain","reason","no","good","boatcrash","check","funni","comment","between","the","two","team","thei","try","but","fail","conjur","there","be","too","mai","person","thei","be","follow","in","thi","movi","thi","film","should","be","about","what","be","happen","on","the","water","not","on","land","i","be","sorri","to","sai","that","there","be","too","far","between","the","funni","part","and","the","sponsor","of","the","film","be","exploit","to","the","max","no","good","all","in","all","i","give","it","four","out","of","ten","sinc","it","have","some","funni","part"],"filtered":["okai","let","see","funni","movi","know","peopl","funni","accent","peopl","fall","water","silli","boat","crash","funni","comment","two","team","thi","movi","thei","twist","accent","part","max","good","whole","lot","peopl","fall","water","uncertain","reason","good","boatcrash","check","funni","comment","two","team","thei","try","fail","conjur","mai","person","thei","follow","thi","movi","thi","film","happen","water","land","sorri","sai","far","funni","part","sponsor","film","exploit","max","good","give","four","ten","sinc","funni","part"],"filtered2":["okai","let","see","funni","know","peopl","funni","accent","peopl","fall","water","silli","boat","crash","funni","comment","two","team","twist","accent","part","max","good","whole","lot","peopl","fall","water","uncertain","reason","good","boatcrash","check","funni","comment","two","team","try","fail","conjur","mai","person","follow","happen","water","land","sorri","far","funni","part","sponsor","exploit","max","good","give","four","ten","sinc","funni","part"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,23,26,30,36,39,46,47,61,62,72,94,95,101,111,124,153,162,169,191,215,260,280,385,435,437,505,545,559,606,723,830,870,918,1183,1449,2340,5434,7171],"values":[1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,23,26,30,36,39,46,47,61,62,72,94,95,101,111,124,153,162,169,191,215,260,280,385,435,437,505,545,559,606,723,830,870,918,1183,1449,2340,5434,7171],"values":[0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,4.094543182127343,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.655771293751733,3.412938870621443,5.645555114217758,12.13567226704156,1.9209463754160525,2.08112281984698,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.1183455303375887,2.2323930368088845,2.3409902041158843,2.3586007221245198,4.814274222781855,2.5460113484259455,2.605934685587711,2.6754694156628323,5.605761068896383,3.09496984188738,3.2829611516442836,3.1952392950510555,3.41740676039221,3.442099372982581,7.145555393249395,3.584239140143704,7.730438832658932,11.871301104477158,3.944626193933877,4.039936373738201,4.315570107673808,4.679973728984199,10.746241819088288,6.2980697041614135,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0481646893745126E-4,2.0463497070976388E-4,2.0468549666480008E-4,2.0464434833266978E-4,2.0466371549280425E-4,2.0463384241427014E-4,2.046974863802565E-4,2.046033962360689E-4,2.04635013957273E-4,2.0484648206987058E-4,2.064718792824181E-4,2.0463535196139888E-4,2.0482915457133724E-4,2.0485049423537817E-4,2.047574360046267E-4,2.046451543971387E-4,2.047155602448592E-4,2.0481190008348783E-4,2.0465571934409366E-4,2.0465497110247846E-4,2.0483908935972135E-4,2.0467547544121244E-4,2.046757851998068E-4,2.04806902699235E-4,2.0465579316856488E-4,2.0485294270440444E-4,2.0470700748843475E-4,2.0463451208033366E-4,2.0472728462306997E-4,2.047897703414148E-4,2.046764794075455E-4,2.0478609967276737E-4,2.0488664453525857E-4,2.050768111108384E-4,2.047066537489707E-4,2.0464503027660844E-4,2.0471881636714275E-4,2.0466581389049765E-4,2.0460361461226772E-4,2.0465565596554776E-4,2.048607559064064E-4,2.0474837688640166E-4,2.0478656634500468E-4,2.046137977113288E-4,2.046557080042966E-4,2.046449533222635E-4,2.0471422378351417E-4,2.047497214857898E-4,2.047080867869224E-4,2.046756401934988E-4,2.04645459393508E-4,2.0506474470589778E-4,2.046969540860498E-4,2.0465566109746818E-4,2.0469585785804522E-4,2.046347214492579E-4,0.9838262975206153,2.0466664788313993E-4,2.0464574668954013E-4,2.0463460463854033E-4,2.0479831723105367E-4,2.0471610605268082E-4,2.046345190959025E-4,2.0461371434704075E-4,2.045931381778638E-4,2.0477812276154737E-4,2.046445439931071E-4,2.0473756779124897E-4,2.047976530770758E-4,2.0470474036713468E-4,2.046559321571117E-4,2.046139825819855E-4,2.046663266192353E-4,2.0461387237436028E-4,2.0462461017947158E-4,2.046139883730712E-

{"value":"This film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment, promising to develop into something worth hanging on for. But it doesn't. It's flat, self conscious, unimaginative and tedious.<br /><br />A series of set images and backdrops don't make a film, they make a calendar. This kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary (\"It's TRUE it REALLY happened\") not only fails to entertain, it fails to convince, so it doesn't even function as social history. Clichés co-mingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish, the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly. The characters are one dimensional, never developing to the extent that one feels for them. The director's ego is the largest character in this film.","finished_norm":["thi","film","limp","from","self","indulg","moment","to","self","indulg","moment","promis","to","develop","into","someth","worth","hang","on","for","but","it","doe","not","it","flat","self","consciou","unimagin","and","tediousbr","br","a","seri","of","set","imag","and","backdrop","do","not","make","a","film","thei","make","a","calendar","thi","kind","of","piti","socialist","pseudo","drama","documentari","it","true","it","realli","happen","not","onli","fail","to","entertain","it","fail","to","convinc","so","it","doe","not","even","function","a","social","histori","cliché","comingl","with","bad","act","make","thi","a","film","veri","difficult","to","finish","the","amus","factor","wear","off","fairli","quickli","the","charact","be","on","dimension","never","develop","to","the","extent","that","on","feel","for","them","the","director","ego","be","the","larg","charact","in","thi","film"],"filtered":["thi","film","limp","self","indulg","moment","self","indulg","moment","promis","develop","someth","worth","hang","doe","flat","self","consciou","unimagin","tediousbr","br","seri","set","imag","backdrop","make","film","thei","make","calendar","thi","kind","piti","socialist","pseudo","drama","documentari","true","realli","happen","onli","fail","entertain","fail","convinc","doe","even","function","social","histori","cliché","comingl","bad","act","make","thi","film","veri","difficult","finish","amus","factor","wear","fairli","quickli","charact","dimension","never","develop","extent","feel","director","ego","larg","charact","thi","film"],"filtered2":["limp","self","indulg","moment","self","indulg","moment","promis","develop","someth","worth","hang","doe","flat","self","consciou","unimagin","tediousbr","set","imag","backdrop","make","make","calendar","kind","piti","socialist","pseudo","drama","documentari","true","realli","happen","onli","fail","entertain","fail","convinc","doe","even","function","social","histori","cliché","comingl","bad","act","make","veri","difficult","finish","amus","factor","wear","fairli","quickli","charact","dimension","never","develop","extent","feel","director","ego","larg","charact"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,9,10,11,13,15,18,21,42,43,53,58,94,109,122,188,195,215,219,304,320,463,478,499,514,523,564,573,593,624,683,708,742,770,803,819,848,975,1108,1266,1572,2353,2441,2603,2634,2677,3001,3009,4176,6321,7263,7855,8096],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,9,10,11,13,15,18,21,42,43,53,58,94,109,122,188,195,215,219,304,320,463,478,499,514,523,564,573,593,624,683,708,742,770,803,819,848,975,1108,1266,1572,2353,2441,2603,2634,2677,3001,3009,4176,6321,7263,7855,8096],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,2.430631986809635,1.162015545335049,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.7003182735607676,1.865701314626681,2.08112281984698,2.125691139326857,2.2489347673732487,5.075762444685391,2.51289241584188,5.211869371175422,2.5792094178355414,2.871119826396843,5.87659672830711,3.3467891931782563,3.3243163373261977,3.3814747511661465,3.405285399859865,3.4986697244709752,3.469984576472117,3.4623020803001006,3.490764544963862,3.9241755834625858,3.6105180246075443,3.6683728173057184,3.7740817043309423,3.7264536553416874,3.7636829971100436,3.835141961092188,3.827761853794566,4.086456389373095,12.497117283081705,4.327618446189983,4.573751515728891,5.102830579804232,5.185068678041204,5.214056214914456,5.2288713006995975,5.3560264761848435,5.444579873526289,10.889159747052577,5.907203395474402,6.600350576034347,6.725513718988353,6.948657270302562,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8905805373476222E-4,1.8889051983545765E-4,1.8893715836394996E-4,1.8889917595156223E-4,1.8891705301789572E-4,1.8888947835011622E-4,1.889482256002947E-4,1.8886137467649926E-4,1.8889055975553803E-4,1.890857576807931E-4,1.9058609813263434E-4,1.8889087175389698E-4,1.890697633461295E-4,1.8908946115349756E-4,1.8900356274854436E-4,1.88899919998076E-4,1.889649088762196E-4,1.8905383640476623E-4,1.889096720864675E-4,1.8890898141396336E-4,1.8907893375984627E-4,1.8892790816528503E-4,1.8892819409130102E-4,1.8904922351525833E-4,1.88909740230943E-4,1.8909172123927648E-4,1.8895701416202958E-4,1.8889009649260873E-4,1.8897573119015402E-4,1.8903340930733755E-4,1.889288348872519E-4,1.8903002105699818E-4,1.891228300782367E-4,1.892983653896843E-4,1.889566876389968E-4,1.8889980542728E-4,1.889679144750606E-4,1.8891898996654998E-4,1.8886157625100814E-4,1.8890961358421622E-4,1.8909893329976943E-4,1.889952006316254E-4,1.8903045182384705E-4,1.8887097587057714E-4,1.8890966161914536E-4,1.8889973439374077E-4,1.889636752411409E-4,1.8899644177861272E-4,1.8895801042

{"value":"pokemon the movie was a terrible film. unlike the first one, this is not a good film at all. the graphics were decent but the story was flat and no real drama was built up in it. in the first one the interaction between the characters were decent. the subtraction of brock and addition of tracey was bad. tracey really doesn't have much to say or do, and unlike brock offers no comic relief. the only good points is you get to see misty actually get jelous over ash, and her early brooding over being called his girlfriend was entertaining. overall this film isn't worth renting and the short movie before didn't do anything for me or my wife. and we do consider ourselves pokemon fans.oh well, maybe the next one will be better.cant ge t much

{"value":"I just saw this at the Venice Film Festival, and can't quite decide about it. We were never allowed to get close enough to any of the characters to care about them. Maybe that was the point, that we are all in a \"bubble\" of our own, but these people didn't compel me to be concerned about them or shocked at their various fates. At a running time of just over an hour, the characters weren't very well developed. Lots of time was devoted to shots of factory equipment (forklifts, conveyor belts, shovels); and the slightly-creepy-looking baby dolls with surprisingly lifelike eyes, that most of the characters made for a living, were somehow more interesting than the live people. An interesting experiment, but somehow it never quite came together.","finished_norm":["i","just","see","thi","at","the","venic","film","festiv","and","ca","not","quit","decid","about","it","we","be","never","allow","to","get","close","enough","to","ani","of","the","charact","to","care","about","them","mayb","that","be","the","point","that","we","be","all","in","a","bubbl","of","our","own","but","thi","peopl","do","not","compel","me","to","be","concern","about","them","or","shock","at","their","variou","fate","at","a","run","time","of","just","over","a","hour","the","charact","be","not","veri","good","develop","lot","of","time","be","devot","to","shot","of","factori","equip","forklift","conveyor","belt","shovel","and","the","slightlycreepylook","babi","doll","with","surprisingli","lifelik","ey","that","much","of","the","charact","make","for","a","live","be","somehow","much","interest","than","the","live","peopl","a","interest","experi","but","somehow","it","never","quit","come","togeth"],"filtered":["see","thi","venic","film","festiv","ca","quit","decid","never","allow","get","close","enough","ani","charact","care","mayb","point","bubbl","thi","peopl","compel","concern","shock","variou","fate","run","time","hour","charact","veri","good","develop","lot","time","devot","shot","factori","equip","forklift","conveyor","belt","shovel","slightlycreepylook","babi","doll","surprisingli","lifelik","ey","much","charact","make","live","somehow","much","interest","live","peopl","interest","experi","somehow","never","quit","come","togeth"],"filtered2":["see","venic","festiv","ca","quit","decid","never","allow","get","close","enough","ani","charact","care","mayb","point","bubbl","peopl","compel","concern","shock","variou","fate","run","time","hour","charact","veri","good","develop","lot","time","devot","shot","factori","equip","forklift","conveyor","belt","shovel","slightlycreepylook","babi","doll","surprisingli","lifelik","ey","charact","make","live","somehow","interest","live","peopl","interest","experi","somehow","never","quit","come","togeth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,8,10,15,23,27,34,42,60,66,72,81,93,116,120,137,163,174,205,249,270,281,295,320,333,441,508,521,549,698,874,942,1217,1253,1398,1697,1757,2836,2941,2992,3586,3772,7962],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,8,10,15,23,27,34,42,60,66,72,81,93,116,120,137,163,174,205,249,270,281,295,320,333,441,508,521,549,698,874,942,1217,1253,1398,1697,1757,2836,2941,2992,3586,3772,7962],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.8837873718108231,3.3716610723085094,1.2000607798565692,2.729695454751562,1.3002700588679295,1.3982850089458962,3.2439908614907673,3.676353282473182,1.929723173391612,1.9209463754160525,1.949757232424728,2.035389827120098,4.493325799357863,4.4089000845945225,2.2939035841256437,2.4000574358028657,2.456282578459816,2.571852579609833,2.6754694156628323,2.731603554088023,2.832333801361687,2.7910771187233068,2.938298364153555,2.948928684455311,3.293679367864308,3.4149707055943286,3.4076979462652486,6.894223829612251,3.90413483257914,3.872882289075035,3.9739784059464043,4.477736862489302,4.34596758485818,4.429617614145104,4.6973654716960676,4.944927550358424,5.3560264761848435,5.541743621979936,5.408212229355414,5.626901430320244,5.878215858601149,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.194497759780533E-4,2.1925531043720574E-4,2.1930944626706011E-4,2.1926535805328167E-4,2.1928610891855578E-4,2.1925410152956945E-4,2.1932229259911829E-4,2.1922148009526627E-4,2.192553567745742E-4,2.194819334272076E-4,2.2122345868647684E-4,2.1925571892772572E-4,2.1946336794909384E-4,2.1948623224568836E-4,2.1938652538130743E-4,2.192662217077917E-4,2.1934165776813373E-4,2.1944488069798156E-4,2.192775414774104E-4,2.1927673977696274E-4,2.194740125378644E-4,2.1929870906764085E-4,2.19299040957232E-4,2.1943952627086715E-4,2.1927762057634103E-4,2.1948885564790834E-4,2.1933249395190803E-4,2.1925481904056052E-4,2.1935421980567488E-4,2.1942116987547997E-4,2.1929978476330155E-4,2.1941723695242675E-4,2.1952496533805853E-4,2.19728718545142E-4,2.193321149391922E-4,2.192660887193523E-4,2.1934514652716464E-4,2.1928835723826422E-4,2.192217140735599E-4,2.1927747357072412E-4,2.1949722707154386E-4,2.1937681902578165E-4,2.1941773696650504E-4,2.192326247137995E-4,2.1927752932743077E-4,2.1926600626693117E-4,2.1934022582203932E-4,2.193782596913494E-4,2.1933365036190064E-4,2.1929888559081069E-4,2.1926654849491612E-4,2.197157900444466E-4,2.1932172227464672E-4,2.1927747906929943E-4,2.1932054772559178E-4,2.192550433680463E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630247E-4,2.1926685631708595E-4,2.1925491821167615E-4,2.1943032740576204E-4,2.1934224257171326E-4,2.1925482655736335E-4,2.1923253539347075E-4,2.192104891403555E-4,2.194086901232127E-4,2.1926556769286462E-4,2.

{"value":"This is one of the worst movies ever made. Trite. Predictable. Flat.<br /><br />The only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting Barcelona. I imagine they would use films like this in Guantanamo or some other hidden CIA/NSA prison to torture suspects.<br /><br />Often bad movies have some redeeming features, this has nothing. If I was in it or worked on it, I would change my name. Truly a turd. Hard to write more than this, but I feel the world's film watchers needed a head's up on this. On the other hand it will make a great gift for people you can't stand.<br /><br />You could send it to politicians you dislike, in laws, ex-wives, Teachers you hated, former employees, Dick Cheney,

{"value":"Caught part of GEORGE 2 on TV recently, but couldn't get myself to watch it through to the end. Just awful! I can't even remember the plot. All I know is that George and Ursula were not the George and Ursula of the first movie, which was bad enough. There's a lot of scrambling around, but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy, it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. Having the original voice of Ape the Ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this. GEORGE 2 is probably the single worst sequel I have ever seen, and that is saying something. Jeez, because of IMDb's 10 lines rule, I have to keep typing when I have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made-for-TV sequel.

{"value":"There is no reason to see this movie. A good plot idea is handled very badly. In the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense. The reason for the killings are not made clear. The acting is awful. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. He was excellent in In the Bedroom, but here he is terrible. Amber Benson from Buffy, has to change her character someday. Even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed. Even though the movie was 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for this one),there are no deleted scenes in the DVD which means they never bothered to fill in the missing

{"value":"There is no reason to see this movie. A good plot idea is handled very badly. In the middle of the movie everything changes and from there on nothing makes much sense. The reason for the killings are not made clear. The acting is awful. Nick Stahl obviously needs a better director. He was excellent in In the Bedroom, but here he is terrible. Amber Benson from Buffy, has to change her character someday. Even those of you who enjoy gratuitous sex and violence will be disappointed. Even though the movie was 80 minutes, which is too short for a good movie (but too long for this one),there are no deleted scenes in the DVD which means they never bothered to fill in the missing

{"value":"I saw this film at the NY Gay & Lesbian Film Festival and thought it was pretty bad. First and most distracting was the way much of it was shot; that is, a lot of slow motion and overly arty close-ups that seemed to have no point--story wise or aesthetically--other than to show the skills of the cinematographer (who I believe was also the director). This film seemed what a pretentious film student would come up with. The lead actor (Sam Levine) was certainly very cute, but was a mediocre actor at best; and the rest of the cast ranged from so-so, to bad. The story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable.

{"value":"this by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot. the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot. my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it. borrowing some ideas from movies like Resident Evil and Aliens doesn't result in a movie like them. if this going to be a top Korean movie, I'd rather won't bother to see even a Korean movie trailer...<br /><br />By the way, this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising.

{"value":"ET's obsession with Dannielynn Smith is despicable. Leave the child alone. With all the constant attention she'll most likely grow up psychotic, depressed or worse. Think of Princess Diana and how she longed for privacy. Now poor little rich girl Ashley Olson just wants to be left alone. No wonder Greta Garbo became a recluse and said \"I want to be alone\". How much does ET make off this little girl? Does ET not have anything better to report on? I bet there's lots of people who really don't care what color her birthday cake and balloons were. By the way, I never heard that Anna Nichole ever won any of those court cases over the will and her inheritance. Who is paying for the lifestyle of Larry, Howard and little Dannielynn?

{"value":"The movie opens upon Julian Sands, lying on his back, a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it, about two feet above him. That was so provocative, and I thought, \"Here we go! A good vampire movie!\" <br /><br />And then it died. That was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination. It was slow, uneventful drivel thereafter. I was vastly disappointed, as my previous experience with Sands' acting was quite enjoyable. However, this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired.<br /><br />Even Julian Sands's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge

{"value":"WARNING! Don't even consider watching this film in any form. It's not even worth downloading from the internet. Every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid.

If you're looking for a fun-filled movie - go look somewhere else.<br /><br />Let's hope this Mr. Unterwaldt (the \"Jr.\" being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy)

{"value":"Why is it that any film about Cleopatra, the last phaoroh brings out the worst in movie making? Whatever attraction the woman had for the greatest Roman of them all, Julius Ceasar, and his successor, Mark Anthony, never seems to come across on the screen as other than the antics of over sexed high school seniors. Despite lavish sets and costumes, this movie is as bad as any Italian \"sandals and toga\" extravaganza of the 50's. Admittedly, this kind of spectacular belongs on the big screen, which is why \"Gladiator\" went over well, but \"Gladiator\" did not have all the romance novel sex.<br /><br />Miss Varela has as little acting talent as Elizabeth Taylor, but Timothy Dalton has talent to spare.

{"value":"Probably encouraged by admirers of her much-better \"Orlando\", Potter here delivers a vehicle for herself in the worst way: she writes, directs, stars, and actually co-writes the music, including a mawkish love song. The film strongly resembles a high school or college project by a teenager convinced that her own intimate loves and melodramatic obsessions are as fascinating to us as to her. But Potter's character is as unsympathetic as the object of her romantic obsession is unlikable, and the whole film is an embarrassing display of narcissism masquerading as a celebration of the tango. Perhaps if she hadn't cast herself it might have worked. She just can't act, whether playing herself or not.

{"value":"As long as there's been 3d technology, (1950's I think) there's been animation made for it. I remember specifically, a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale in it. I don't remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that Donald worked at a circus, was feeding an elephant peanuts and Chip and Dale were stealing the peanuts. This was made to watch in 3d probably 1960's. If you happened to watch Meet the Robinsons in 3d in theaters, they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it's origin. There are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses. This claim was a bad move because it's not difficult to prove them wrong. On top of that, this just looks like a bad movie.","finished_norm":["a","long","a","there","be","have","technologi","i","think","there","be","anim","make","for","it","i","rememb","specif","a","donald","duck","cartoon","with","chip","and","dale","in","it","i","do","not","rememb","the","name","at","the","moment","but","the","plot","be","that","donald","work","at","a","circu","be","fe","a","eleph","peanut","and","chip","and","dale","be","steal","the","peanut","thi","be","make","to","watch","in","have","probabl","if","you","happen","to","watch","meet","the","robinson","in","have","in","theater","thei","show","thi","cartoon","befor","the","movi","and","explain","the","detail","of","it","origin","there","be","probabl","somewher","around","cartoon","make","specif","to","be","view","through","have","glass","thi","claim","be","a","bad","move","becaus","it","not","difficult","to","prove","them","wrong","on","top","of","that","thi","just","look","like","a","bad","movi"],"filtered":["long","technologi","think","anim","make","rememb","specif","donald","duck","cartoon","chip","dale","rememb","name","moment","plot","donald","work","circu","fe","eleph","peanut","chip","dale","steal","peanut","thi","make","watch","probabl","happen","watch","meet","robinson","theater","thei","show","thi","cartoon","befor","movi","explain","detail","origin","probabl","somewher","around","cartoon","make","specif","view","glass","thi","claim","bad","move","becaus","difficult","prove","wrong","top","thi","look","like","bad","movi"],"filtered2":["long","technologi","think","anim","make","rememb","specif","donald","duck","cartoon","chip","dale","rememb","name","moment","plot","donald","work","circu","fe","eleph","peanut","chip","dale","steal","peanut","make","watch","probabl","happen","watch","meet","robinson","theater","show","cartoon","befor","explain","detail","origin","probabl","somewher","around","cartoon","make","specif","view","glass","claim","bad","move","becaus","difficult","prove","wrong","top","look","like","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,9,12,16,22,25,28,32,48,69,79,94,98,99,143,148,188,275,277,290,312,350,364,395,424,540,578,653,740,751,803,804,1662,1777,1829,2122,2780,3220,3720,4795,4958,4977,8161],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,9,12,16,22,25,28,32,48,69,79,94,98,99,143,148,188,275,277,290,312,350,364,395,424,540,578,653,740,751,803,804,1662,1777,1829,2122,2780,3220,3720,4795,4958,4977,8161],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,1.9218995441445863,2.1367141713444147,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,1.6955116224012472,2.127032521151058,1.9469506069506084,2.08112281984698,2.0881990796736947,2.056430207256609,2.3409902041158843,4.603730819247303,2.5378812223426954,2.7832848715031413,3.1163992333432793,5.7225627547931115,2.8824835850471584,3.0135689919434205,2.9878441007049847,3.153168081130368,3.212973749990824,3.432149042129413,3.575630765607104,11.973438628706308,3.7165362186843414,3.8023521382691974,3.7636829971100436,3.7740817043309423,9.377263583454626,4.770124825978496,4.944927550358424,4.9909126636002465,10.889159747052577,5.649374286172302,5.907203395474402,6.1754673820690815,6.255510089742618,12.350934764138163,14.071337294584385]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612973E-4,2.1169300653874423E-4,2.1174527517734863E-4,2.1170270760391532E-4,2.1172274275403047E-4,2.116918393273702E-4,2.1175767842838492E-4,2.1166034303434324E-4,2.1169305127789707E-4,2.1191181310725393E-4,2.1359327166514577E-4,2.1169340094007543E-4,2.1189388796841969E-4,2.1191596365579453E-4,2.1181969576676937E-4,2.117035414702398E-4,2.1177637567609508E-4,2.1187603835847048E-4,2.1171447081128576E-4,2.1171369676217488E-4,2.1190416541618464E-4,2.1173490831315574E-4,2.1173522875558994E-4,2.1187086861014428E-4,2.117145471820264E-4,2.1191849657461963E-4,2.1176752792775858E-4,2.116925320907912E-4,2.117885044381763E-4,2.1185314534259388E-4,2.117359469071496E-4,2.1184934806943337E-4,2.119533608105546E-4,2.1215008639459355E-4,2.117671619875167E-4,2.1170341306868588E-4,2.1177974410483173E-4,2.117249135272619E-4,2.1166056894252467E-4,2.117144052467594E-4,2.1192657926066667E-4,2.1181032419177905E-4,2.118498308375968E-4,2.1167110326541507E-4,2.1171445908036937E-4,2.1170333346011953E-4,2.1177499311905083E-4,2.1181171516755447E-4,2.117686444521777E-4,2.1173507874788991E-4,2.1170385698619573E-4,2.1213760380898693E-4,2.1175712777489402E-4,2.1171441055568415E-4,2.1175599373704442E-4,2.1169274868102937E-4,0.9832684526361813,2.1172577628502642E-4,2.1170415419131467E-4,2.116926278414099E-4,2.1186198702179433E-4,2.1177694030929706E-4,2.1169253934833304E-4,2.1167101702582116E-4,2.1164973116690364E-4,2.118410960276968E-4,2.117029100128491E-4,2.1179914228165438E-4,2.1186129996057554E-4,2.117

{"value":"Pedantic, overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Begins quite promisingly, with a still-relevant probe into an airplane explosion, however the melodrama involving James Stewart and wife Vera Miles just gets in the way (Miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress, and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule). Esteemed director Mervyn LeRoy helmed this adaptation of Don Whitehead's book, but despite the talent involved, the picture fails to make much of an impression. Best performance is turned in by Murray Hamilton as Stewart's partner, however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is. *1/2 from

{"value":"I saw the capsule comment said \"great acting.\" In my opinion, these are two great actors giving horrible performances, and with zero chemistry with one another, for a great director in his all-time worst effort. Robert De Niro has to be the most ingenious and insightful illiterate of all time. Jane Fonda's performance uncomfortably drifts all over the map as she clearly has no handle on this character, mostly because the character is so poorly written. Molasses-like would be too swift an adjective for this film's excruciating pacing. Although the film's intent is to be an uplifting story of curing illiteracy, watching it is a true \"bummer.\" I give it 1 out of 10, truly one of the worst 20 movies for its budget level that I have ever

{"value":"Basically there's a family where a little boy (Jake) thinks there's a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time.<br /><br />This movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, Jake decides to become Rambo and kill the zombie.<br /><br />OK, first of all when you're going to make a film you must Decide if its a thriller or a drama! As a drama the movie is watchable. Parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. And then we have Jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! I expected to see a BOOGEYMAN similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots.<br /><br />3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs.

{"value":"If you like movies about creepy towns, hotels, houses, states (ala the Eagles \"Hotel California\"), etc. that possess the people that are \"just passing through,\" read almost any Stephen King novel instead.

{"value":"I have seen most, if not all of the Laurel & Hardy classic films. I have always enjoyed there comical stupidly, even after watching it over and over again. This new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both Laurel & Hardy, however fails miserably for various reasons. One of which is how out of place their cloths are (still early 20th century) however are both portrayed in the 90's setting. Some of the former dialogue was brought back, however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series. This film could very well be the worst film I have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever.

{"value":"The Fluffer may have strong elements of porn industry truth to it - but that doesn't make up for the fact that it's pretty shabbily directed and acted - and with a very mediocre script.<br /><br />B grade from start to the exceedingly drawn out finish.<br /><br />It would be embarassing to think of the general public being offered this piece as an example of state of the art gay film making.<br /><br />Hopefully it has a limited life in the gay film festival circuit and is allowed to die a natural death on video.<br /><br />This film will open the Queer Film Weekend in Brisbane on April 10, 2002.

{"value":"The title creatures wreak havoc at a peaceful little desert town. That's basically the whole plot for this film, and while the scenes devoted to the Munchies themselves are somewhat fun (in a lowbrow kind of way), all the rest is just filler, and bad filler at that. From the \"hero\", who is a painful Woody Allen wannabe, to the ultra-dumb town cop, it's hard to pick the most irritating character in the film. There were some times when almost all of them were on the screen together and I was thinking, \"OK, at least the girlfriend is cute, but why do we have to put up with the rest of those morons?\". The film is also filled with pop references (from Ozzy Osbourne to Linda Blair), which probably made it already dated by the early 90's.

{"value":"I think that Elisabeth Rohm, though she may try hard, is not very good at all. I guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price. I mainly watched it for the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well.<br /><br />He was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch. When he wasn't on the screen, the thing went dead. This was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me the creeps, but be assured that in real life he is a kind, funny compassionate man. He even said playing that role gave him the creeps.<br /><br />I'll watch anything with him in it, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. She was as exciting as lint on Law and Order.

{"value":"Pointless short about a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other. That's it. For about 5 minutes we see this. It's shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of dreadful music. It LOOKS interesting but there's no plot and really--the violence inherent in this got disturbing. Also the homo eroticism in this is played up but mixing it with violence was not a good idea. Some people who like avant garde material might like this but I found it incomprehensible, boring, stupid and (ocassionally) disturbing. Really--what is the point in all this? I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in stunned silence. I really wish I could go lower than
