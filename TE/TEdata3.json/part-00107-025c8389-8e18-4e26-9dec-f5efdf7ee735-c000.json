{"value":"There's so little here of the fantastic Anne Rice book that what IS here makes no sense. Some of the characters--intense and surprising characters--don't make it to the screen at all, and those who do are watered down to the point that there's no reason for their existence.<br /><br />Where's the relationship between Christophe and Marcel? Where's the continued affair between Marcel and Juliet? Why does Dolly Rose appear at all, since her story's never explained? Where's the rape and redemption of Marie, whose greatest attribute (and downfall) is that she can pass for white--and her marriage to Richard? Why does the film end with Marcel's beating at the hands of his father? We learn nothing of Aglae beyond that she's a bitch who hates her husband; why no backstory explaining this hatred? <br /><br />As for the performances, there's not a one that's better than mediocre, though that's likely due to the lousy script. Best of the lot is that of the actor playing Richard--but Richard's not on screen enough to salvage the film. Worst is Jasmine Guy as Dolly Rose, though again, it comes down to the actress having nothing to do with what little she's given to work with.<br /><br />All in all, this is just terrible. I thought it'd be impossible for any Anne Rice book-turned film to be worse than EXIT TO EDEN, but FEAST OF ALL SAINTS makes that mess look like a critical hit. How is it that Rice is such a slut she'll allow her best works to become such junk on the screen?","finished_norm":["there","so","littl","here","of","the","fantast","ann","rice","book","that","what","be","here","make","no","sens","some","of","the","charactersintens","and","surpris","charactersdont","make","it","to","the","screen","at","all","and","that","who","do","be","water","down","to","the","point","that","there","no","reason","for","their","existencebr","br","where","the","relationship","between","christoph","and","marcel","where","the","continu","affair","between","marcel","and","juliet","why","doe","dolli","rise","appear","at","all","sinc","her","stori","never","explain","where","the","rape","and","redempt","of","mari","whose","great","attribut","and","downfal","be","that","she","can","pass","for","whiteand","her","marriag","to","richard","why","doe","the","film","end","with","marcel","beat","at","the","hand","of","hi","father","we","learn","noth","of","agla","beyond","that","she","a","bitch","who","hate","her","husband","why","no","backstori","explain","thi","hatr","br","br","a","for","the","perform","there","not","a","on","that","well","than","mediocr","though","that","like","due","to","the","lousi","script","well","of","the","lot","be","that","of","the","actor","plai","richardbut","richard","not","on","screen","enough","to","salvag","the","film","wrong","be","jasmin","gui","a","dolli","rise","though","again","it","come","down","to","the","actress","have","noth","to","do","with","what","littl","she","give","to","work","withbr","br","all","in","all","thi","be","just","terribl","i","think","it","have","be","imposs","for","ani","ann","rice","bookturn","film","to","be","wrong","than","exit","to","eden","but","feast","of","all","saint","make","that","mess","look","like","a","critic","hit","how","be","it","that","rice","be","such","a","slut","she","will","allow","her","well","work","to","becom","such","junk","on","the","screen"],"filtered":["littl","fantast","ann","rice","book","make","sens","charactersintens","surpris","charactersdont","make","screen","water","point","reason","existencebr","br","relationship","christoph","marcel","continu","affair","marcel","juliet","doe","dolli","rise","appear","sinc","stori","never","explain","rape","redempt","mari","whose","great","attribut","downfal","pass","whiteand","marriag","richard","doe","film","end","marcel","beat","hand","hi","father","learn","noth","agla","beyond","bitch","hate","husband","backstori","explain","thi","hatr","br","br","perform","well","mediocr","though","like","due","lousi","script","well","lot","actor","plai","richardbut","richard","screen","enough","salvag","film","wrong","jasmin","gui","dolli","rise","though","come","actress","noth","littl","give","work","withbr","br","thi","terribl","think","imposs","ani","ann","rice","bookturn","film","wrong","exit","eden","feast","saint","make","mess","look","like","critic","hit","rice","slut","allow","well","work","becom","junk","screen"],"filtered2":["littl","fantast","ann","rice","book","make","sens","charactersintens","surpris","charactersdont","make","screen","water","point","reason","existencebr","relationship","christoph","marcel","continu","affair","marcel","juliet","doe","dolli","rise","appear","sinc","stori","never","explain","rape","redempt","mari","whose","great","attribut","downfal","pass","whiteand","marriag","richard","doe","end","marcel","beat","hand","father","learn","noth","agla","beyond","bitch","hate","husband","backstori","explain","hatr","perform","well","mediocr","though","like","due","lousi","script","well","lot","actor","plai","richardbut","richard","screen","enough","salvag","wrong","jasmin","gui","dolli","rise","though","come","actress","noth","littl","give","work","withbr","terribl","think","imposs","ani","ann","rice","bookturn","wrong","exit","eden","feast","saint","make","mess","look","like","critic","hit","rice","slut","allow","well","work","becom","junk","screen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,12,14,16,17,18,20,24,25,27,30,34,40,41,42,48,49,51,55,66,72,77,86,93,95,105,115,151,162,166,170,173,192,235,326,339,343,355,388,395,407,431,433,487,502,521,536,568,577,579,598,641,678,746,787,830,901,921,922,1116,1162,1201,1287,1392,1478,1482,2908,2994,3073,3247,3383,3460,3480,3494,4247,4447,4562,5001,5495,5963,7824],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,12,14,16,17,18,20,24,25,27,30,34,40,41,42,48,49,51,55,66,72,77,86,93,95,105,115,151,162,166,170,173,192,235,326,339,343,355,388,395,407,431,433,487,502,521,536,568,577,579,598,641,678,746,787,830,901,921,922,1116,1162,1201,1287,1392,1478,1482,2908,2994,3073,3247,3383,3460,3480,3494,4247,4447,4562,5001,5495,5963,7824],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.292076589

{"value":"In modern day Eastern Europe life is hard and for young women prostitution is one of the only career options and one taken, reluctantly, by Melania. She attracts the attentions of an American, Seymour, who becomes obsessed with her, paying more and more money for time with her until he eventually wants to buy her outright. She has two pimps with differring emotional attachments to her and she is generally passed around like some piece of baggage with no feelings of her own. However, we are in \"modern art-house cinema\" territory, so conventions like narrative structure, lighting the subject so it can be seen, camera techniques that add to rather than distract from the action and a vaguely consistent plot can all be abandoned. Much of the time I had no idea what was supposed to be happening and very rarely did I care. People began leaving the screening almost before the last latecomers had arrived and I don't think I've ever seen so many people walk out.<br /><br />Images are important to the director - characters slowly emerge from or disappear into a dark screen, we get long lingering shots of nothing in particular and one sex scene takes place in infra-red. In fact for such an unconventional film the sex scenes were remarkably ordinary; missionary positions between naked people in bed abounded and there were no drugs or related weirdness. But perhaps these days being ordinary is unconventional.<br /><br />On the whole, almost entirely without merit.<br /><br

{"value":"After sitting through this pile of dung, my husband and I wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie. It was that listless and formulaic. But the U.S. propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves--disappointingly--that it's the work of humans. Call me a conspiracy theorist, but quotes like, \"We have to steal the Declaration of Independence to protect it\" seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of Iraq, etc. The fact that Nicholas Cage spews lines like, \"I would never use the Declaration of Independence as a bargaining chip\" with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took Valium before shooting each scene. The \"reasoning\" behind each plot turn and new \"clue\" is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow. And there's also a bonus side plot of misogyny, with Dr. Whatever-Her-Name-Was being chided by all involved for \"never shutting up.\" She's clearly in the movie only for looks, but they felt the need to slap a \"Dr.\" title on her character to give her some gravity. At one point, Cage's character says, \"Don't you ever shut up?\" and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands, like she's a child. Truly grotesque. The only benefit to this movie was that it's so astonishingly bad, you do get a few laughs out of it. The really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it.

{"value":"\"Steve\"(Chris Hoffman)gathers a group from high school for a reunion at the cabin location where his twin brother Wes went missing. While they are there, a reptilian creature in the shape of a man(reminded me a lot of the Gillman from CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON)awaits in the wilderness choosing the right time to pick them apart one by one. A biker, Ellen Ripley-type time female bad-ass, Kat(Chase Masterson)has an underground military bunker she practices experiments in, while it also serves as a place of safety from the thing on the bloody rampage. Kat knows more than she's telling(she also suffered the loss of a child), but there's another novelty twist most of the group have no idea of. This creature might just be more human than they realize..and it's former identity might shed some light on a deception only one other person has been hiding since Wes' death. Kat holds the key to many of the mysteries that unlock as the group remains near the cabin.<br /><br />Thankfully, a large portion of the film stays away from the creature which leaps in the air while we also see a hazy screen when we look through it's eyes. The film has Dawson's Creek-type melodramatics which often hinder any real tension that needs to build in a little monster movie. The direction is very bland leading to a relatively dull experience instead of eliciting scares. The cast is rather life-less and uninteresting. Pretty Maggie Grace(THE FOG remake) might be the only draw for this film.","finished_norm":["stevechri","hoffmangath","a","group","from","high","school","for","a","reunion","at","the","cabin","locat","where","hi","twin","brother","we","go","miss","while","thei","be","there","a","reptilian","creatur","in","the","shape","of","a","manremind","me","a","lot","of","the","gillman","from","creatur","from","the","black","lagoonawait","in","the","wilder","choos","the","right","time","to","pick","them","apart","on","by","on","a","biker","ellen","ripleytyp","time","femal","badass","katchas","mastersonha","a","underground","militari","bunker","she","practic","experi","in","while","it","conjur","serv","a","a","place","of","safeti","from","the","thing","on","the","bloodi","rampag","kat","know","much","than","she","tellingsh","conjur","suffer","the","loss","of","a","child","but","there","anoth","novelti","twist","much","of","the","group","have","no","idea","of","thi","creatur","mai","just","be","much","human","than","thei","realizeand","it","former","ident","mai","shed","some","light","on","a","decept","onli","on","other","person","have","be","hide","sinc","we","death","kat","hold","the","kei","to","mani","of","the","mysteri","that","unlock","a","the","group","remain","near","the","cabinbr","br","thankfulli","a","larg","portion","of","the","film","stai","awai","from","the","creatur","which","leap","in","the","air","while","we","conjur","see","a","hazi","screen","when","we","look","through","it","ey","the","film","have","dawson","creektyp","melodramat","which","often","hinder","ani","real","tension","that","ne","to","build","in","a","littl","monster","movi","the","direct","be","veri","bland","lead","to","a","rel","dull","experi","instead","of","elicit","scare","the","cast","be","rather","lifeless","and","uninterest","pretti","maggi","graceth","fog","remak","mai","be","the","onli","draw","for","thi","film"],"filtered":["stevechri","hoffmangath","group","high","school","reunion","cabin","locat","hi","twin","brother","go","miss","thei","reptilian","creatur","shape","manremind","lot","gillman","creatur","black","lagoonawait","wilder","choos","right","time","pick","apart","biker","ellen","ripleytyp","time","femal","badass","katchas","mastersonha","underground","militari","bunker","practic","experi","conjur","serv","place","safeti","thing","bloodi","rampag","kat","know","much","tellingsh","conjur","suffer","loss","child","anoth","novelti","twist","much","group","idea","thi","creatur","mai","much","human","thei","realizeand","former","ident","mai","shed","light","decept","onli","person","hide","sinc","death","kat","hold","kei","mani","mysteri","unlock","group","remain","near","cabinbr","br","thankfulli","larg","portion","film","stai","awai","creatur","leap","air","conjur","see","hazi","screen","look","ey","film","dawson","creektyp","melodramat","often","hinder","ani","real","tension","ne","build","littl","monster","movi","direct","veri","bland","lead","rel","dull","experi","instead","elicit","scare","cast","rather","lifeless","uninterest","pretti","maggi","graceth","fog","remak","mai","onli","draw","thi","film"],"filtered2":["stevechri","hoffmangath","group","high","school","reunion","cabin","locat","twin","brother","go","miss","reptilian","creatur","shape","manremind","lot","gillman","creatur","black","lagoonawait","wilder","choos","right","time","pick","apart","biker","ellen","ripleytyp","time","femal","badass","katchas","mastersonha","underground","militari","bunker","practic","experi","conjur","serv","place","safeti","thing","bloodi","rampag","kat","know","tellingsh","conjur","suffer","loss","child","anoth","novelti","twist","group","idea","creatur","mai","human","realizeand","former","ident","mai","shed","light","decept","onli","person","hide","sinc","death","kat","hold","kei","mani","mysteri","unlock","group","remain","near","cabinbr","thankfulli","larg","portion","stai","awai","creatur","leap","air","conjur","see","hazi","screen","look","ey","dawson","creektyp","melodramat","often","hinder","ani","real","tension","ne","build","littl","monster","direct","veri","bland","lead","rel","dull","experi","instead","elicit","scare","cast","rather","lifeless","uninterest","pretti","maggi","graceth","fog","remak","mai","onli","draw"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,6,8,11,14,15,16,26,27,29,39,46,50,72,73,78,80,92,102,110,121,123,152,153,155,157,160,162,164,180,192,211,229,245,255,281,292,296,333,353,366,367,381,400,403,410,413,414,422,435,446,477,483,555,564,572,576,584,623,633,679,682,707,761,775,815,887,917,984,1028,1039,1165,1181,1236,1247,1599,1608,1610,1718,2049,2283,2415,2504,2769,2803,3006,3324,3330,3451,3513,3722,3827,3840,4137,4179,4424,4434,4720,4744,5951,7600,7661,8522],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"First off, I'd like to say that the user comments alone left me with tears in my eyes from laughing. One comment that bad SF movies become good comedies is right on the mark. MST3000 made it's living off that.<br /><br />If you look at THE ANGRY RED PLANET as the fever dream of a 10 year old comic book reader from 1959, you'll have the handle on this sucker. All the elements are there: the pseudoscience, occasionally logical, more often hilariously infantile. The adolescent boy attitude toward sex, with the \"gigolo\" captain (good call on that one, guys!) making eyes at the buxom \"scientist\" with hair so red it's a wonder it doesn't set off the fire alarms. The ridiculous conception of Mars as a planet so alien that everything glows red, yet one alien monster has a mouse face, and the blob alien has an eye that rotates like a kid's toy. The comic relief, an overweight astronaut (!) who sounds like he never finished the 8th grade in Brooklyn and has a psychotic fixation on his ray gun. And of course, the mere fact that alien = dangerously evil. If these people had met E.T., they would have roasted him in two seconds flat! \"OW\" indeed!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I rated this movie low. Still, it's never boring (except when the scientist tries to explain everything - only to make it all sound more and more ridiculous), and you have to admit, in your little kid core, it makes you jump a few times. <br /><br />Okay, then don't admit it. I guess you were never

{"value":"What a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject. There is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment.The dancers keep talking about their art as if it has no erotic component. They may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered. From the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then end up hiring the \"dancers\" for private sessions. Even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the \"dancers\" only playing to the women in the audience. This just isn't the reality of these clubs. It would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples. So what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? We learn very little. Instead we get filler. A gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. A manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the dancers' lives and attitudes.<br /><br />The pictures of Mexico City are generic. The phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous.<br /><br />This is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing. The rest of the movie is an insult to gay men.","finished_norm":["what","a","wast","opportun","to","actual","make","a","interest","film","about","a","complic","subject","there","be","veri","littl","explor","about","what","it","realli","feel","like","to","be","a","straight","or","gai","man","work","in","a","gai","sexual","environmentth","dancer","keep","talk","about","their","art","a","if","it","have","no","erot","compon","thei","mai","not","all","be","prostitut","for","hire","but","thei","be","ind","sex","worker","plai","out","fantasi","and","sell","privat","session","where","much","than","danc","be","offer","from","the","film","on","would","get","the","impress","that","thei","mainli","appeal","to","the","woman","who","go","to","the","gai","club","and","then","end","up","hire","the","dancer","for","privat","session","even","the","shot","in","the","club","onli","show","woman","in","front","of","the","stage","and","the","dancer","onli","plai","to","the","woman","in","the","audienc","thi","just","be","not","the","realiti","of","thi","club","it","would","be","pretti","hard","to","make","a","live","do","privat","danc","for","straight","woman","and","coupl","so","what","do","thei","realli","feel","about","their","gai","admir","and","client","we","learn","veri","littl","instead","we","get","filler","a","gai","activist","who","add","noth","to","the","studi","of","straight","dancer","a","manag","who","tell","u","about","the","costum","for","the","drag","act","but","offer","no","insight","into","the","dancer","live","and","attitudesbr","br","the","pictur","of","mexico","citi","be","gener","the","phallic","montag","show","sausag","roast","be","ridiculousbr","br","thi","be","a","total","simplist","film","which","should","be","of","interest","onli","to","that","who","want","to","see","a","few","pictur","of","pretti","boi","danc","the","rest","of","the","movi","be","a","insult","to","gai","man"],"filtered":["wast","opportun","actual","make","interest","film","complic","subject","veri","littl","explor","realli","feel","like","straight","gai","man","work","gai","sexual","environmentth","dancer","keep","talk","art","erot","compon","thei","mai","prostitut","hire","thei","ind","sex","worker","plai","fantasi","sell","privat","session","much","danc","offer","film","get","impress","thei","mainli","appeal","woman","go","gai","club","end","hire","dancer","privat","session","even","shot","club","onli","show","woman","front","stage","dancer","onli","plai","woman","audienc","thi","realiti","thi","club","pretti","hard","make","live","privat","danc","straight","woman","coupl","thei","realli","feel","gai","admir","client","learn","veri","littl","instead","get","filler","gai","activist","add","noth","studi","straight","dancer","manag","tell","u","costum","drag","act","offer","insight","dancer","live","attitudesbr","br","pictur","mexico","citi","gener","phallic","montag","show","sausag","roast","ridiculousbr","br","thi","total","simplist","film","interest","onli","want","see","pictur","pretti","boi","danc","rest","movi","insult","gai","man"],"filtered2":["wast","opportun","actual","make","interest","complic","subject","veri","littl","explor","realli","feel","like","straight","gai","man","work","gai","sexual","environmentth","dancer","keep","talk","art","erot","compon","mai","prostitut","hire","ind","sex","worker","plai","fantasi","sell","privat","session","danc","offer","get","impress","mainli","appeal","woman","go","gai","club","end","hire","dancer","privat","session","even","shot","club","onli","show","woman","front","stage","dancer","onli","plai","woman","audienc","realiti","club","pretti","hard","make","live","privat","danc","straight","woman","coupl","realli","feel","gai","admir","client","learn","veri","littl","instead","get","filler","gai","activist","add","noth","studi","straight","dancer","manag","tell","u","costum","drag","act","offer","insight","dancer","live","attitudesbr","pictur","mexico","citi","gener","phallic","montag","show","sausag","roast","ridiculousbr","total","simplist","interest","onli","want","see","pictur","pretti","boi","danc","rest","insult","gai","man"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,11,13,14,15,21,24,28,37,40,43,45,46,48,49,52,60,70,78,89,90,112,116,134,152,168,171,184,186,225,226,253,254,282,299,311,345,382,418,431,441,492,507,519,548,550,595,640,656,669,690,709,764,773,776,829,861,993,996,1014,1035,1171,1210,1273,1291,1578,1689,2063,2101,2199,2225,2284,2723,2768,3002,3224,3848,5034,5308,6040,6117,7871],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,11,13,14,15,21,24,28,37,40,43,45,46,48,49,52,60,70,78,89,90,112,116,134,152,168,171,184,186,225,226,253,254,282,

{"value":"SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I watched half of this movie and I didn't like it. <br /><br />First reason: Boring. Barely anything happens, the women sit around and discuss how terrible their lives are and how they have no hope, they smoke weed, read magazines, care for their sick friend, and cut up the occasional dead body. BORING!!!!<br /><br />Second reason: There are too many things left unexplained. Many scenes are dedicated to a zombie hunter who kidnaps random men, restrains them in a chair and interrogates them. Who are these men? How do they know anything about illegal activity concerning the diseased flesh eaters? Why does he kill one and let another one go?<br /><br />Also there is this dude who at first I thought also had the flesh eating disease but he puts his fist through a wall with superhuman strength suggesting he's not quite what we originally thought-never explained! How frustrating is that? <br /><br />Conclusion: I found the women annoying, the story uninteresting, the duologue tedious, and the action non-existent. Also the cover art is misleading since it makes you believe this movie is going to be cool when it clearly isn't. I rented this movie based on some of the reviews made by other people on this website, and although I respect the fact that some people might have enjoyed this flick, I will from now on make sure I

{"value":"Oh, Sam Mraovich, we know you tried so hard. This is your magnum opus, a shining example to the rest of us that you are certainly worth nomination into the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (as you state on your 1998-era web site). Alas, it's better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt. With Ben & Arthur, you do just that.<br /><br />Seemingly assembled with a lack of instruction or education, the film's screenplay guides us toward the truly bizarre with each new scene. It's this insane excuse of a story that may also be the film's best ally. Beginning tepidly, the homosexually titular characters Ben and Arthur attempt to marry, going so far as to fly across country to do so, in the shade of Vermont's finest palm trees. But, all of this posturing is merely a lead-in for BLOOD. Then more BLOOD, and MORE AND MORE BLOOD. I mean, there must be at least $20 in fake blood make-up in the final third of this film.<br /><br />The film in its entirety is a technical gaffe. From the sound to the editing to the music, which consists of a single fuzzy bass note being held on a keyboard, it's a wonder that the film even holds together on whatever media you view it on. It's such a shame then that some decent amateur performances are wasted here.<br /><br />No matter, Sam. I'm sure you've made five figures on this flick in rentals or whatever drives poor souls (such as myself) to view this film.

{"value":"I once promised never to walk out of any film ( a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck, such as Rambo 3, Baise Moi, Deep Impact) - but Mr. Seidl almost succeeded. Hundstage was a truly awful experience. Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a miserable, pathetic bunch of retards. It shows a world where love and humanity don't exist, a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason - to distract from their own miserable existence. By choosing a documentary-like style with non-professional actors (most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shock-cartoonist Deix) director Seidl wants to make us believe that this is real life in Austrian (European? Western?) suburbs. The viewer is confronted with depictions of sex orgies, violence against women and handicapped people, madness and degradation. But this isn't social criticism. This is just pure shock without any aesthetic value. Instead you get bad acting, bad cinematography, bad filmmaking. If anybody needs a film like this to realize that there are things wrong in our society then this person must have walked through life with closed eyes. This is pseudo-social criticism with a sledge hammer. And it looks down on people in a disgustingly condescending way. It shows ugly people - that is not the reason why I hate it. But it depicts average people in an ugly, misanthropic way.

{"value":"How low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory? ST:HF will be glad to show you.<br /><br />If you are used to seeing what made for a good Star Trek show, do NOT watch this.<br /><br />The writing is hodge-podge, the actors' portrayals of their characters weak, and most of all, the design work is downright doggy.<br /><br />Like watching strong captains, don't look here! Like the strong Federation attitude? Forget about it here! Starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing SPIKES in their hair.<br /><br />While a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show's credits, Ensign Spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer. It just degrades from there. No, not even uniforms match, for goodness sake. They are too small or too big, collars down to their chests, and TNG Seasons One and Two Uniforms mixed in with Season Three and DS9 uniforms. The strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads! The only good thing about this show is its graphics, which seem to improve a bit with each season. OK, I take that back. Who uses CG that inexpertly? The designers of this show.<br /><br />Don't bother with it, it will offend your Star Trek sense, as it did mine.

{"value":"Dr. K(David H Hickey)has been trying to master a formula that would end all disease and handicaps, but needs live donors to complete his work. His doctor brother Richard(Dennis O'Neill)has a son named Eddie(Derek Philips)who is accepted to medical school. Eddie has a girlfriend named Sarah(Lizabeth Cardenas)who is pre-law and plans to attend law school herself the coming fall. She and Eddie resume their relationship when Sarah calls things off with her current boyfriend who is also shagging the lady of Walt(Bill Sebastian;Eddie's best friend who recently paid for his cheating girlfriend's boob job). Eddie accidentally gets hit by a car and appears on the throes of death when Dr. K makes a suggestion to Richard..let him \"recuperate\" Eddie using his secret, illegal methods. When Dr. K applies his serum to Eddie horrifying results occur. Eddie's face bulges massive warts while he has also acquired a taste for human flesh. Many will die so that Eddie can feed this uncontrollable appetite he can't quench. Soon he may even pose a threat to his father and girlfriend..Eddie Monster must be stopped.<br /><br />Typically awful direct-to-video horror flick suffers from a severe lack of budget, acting, and overall talent. The premise, which seems like an interesting fright-fest, fails to deliver even as a zombie flick. The gore is limited with a few munching scenes but most of the violence occurs off-camera.

{"value":"I haven't read a biography of Lincoln, so maybe this was an accurate portrayal......<br /><br />And maybe it's because I'm used to the equally alienating and unrealistic worshiping portrayals that unnaturally deify Lincoln as brilliant, honorable, and the savior of our country......<br /><br />But why would they make a movie representing Lincoln as a buffoon? While Henry Fonda made an excellent Lincoln, his portrayal of him as an \"aw shucks, I'm just a simple guy\" seemed a little insulting.<br /><br />[Granted, that was Bushie Jr.'s whole campaign, to make us think he was \"just a regular guy\" so we wouldn't care that he's a rich & privileged moron -- but that's a whole other story.]<br /><br />Not only did the film show Lincoln as sort of a simple (almost simple-minded) kind of guy , the film states that Lincoln just sort of got into law by accident, and that he wasn't even that interested in the law - only with the falsely simplistic idea of the law being about rights & wrongs. In the film he's not a very good defense attorney (he lounges around with his feet on the table and makes fun of the witnesses), and the outcome is mostly determined by chance/luck.<br /><br

{"value":"I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and the memory of it still haunts me to this day. I was fully aware at how awful it was supposed to be going into it, so I have only myself to blame. But like most, I didn't believe all the negativity. Being a Sandler fan, it just seemed inconceivable one of his movies could really be that bad. I figured it was just Sandler haters. I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />What we have here is a comedy that does not contain even 1 second of anything funny. That is actually quite an accomplish. You'd think in a 90 minute comedy, they might have accidentally stumbled upon something even remotely amusing. But no, it's just horrible. It's not \"so bad it's good\", its just bad. You cannot laugh at how bad it is, you can only cry. You wait patiently for a joke that will at least make you chuckle, but they never come.<br /><br />Have you seen the movie The Ring? Where the people watch a video tape and die 7 days later? If this movie was on the video tape, people would die instantly, by their own hand, and there would be smile on their face as they realize their agony has ended, and that would be the first smile since they pressed play.<br /><br />You might be inclined to watch it just to see how bad it is, unable to curb your curiosity.

{"value":"Definitely, definitely the worst film I've ever seen, no questions asked! Contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others, since it's an independent, low-budget film, but c'mon already  the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying.<br /><br />Agreeing with everything that has been said about this film, for example the mind numbingly weak acting (when it's this bad you take another go at shooting the scene, god damn it), the thing I found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script, assuming such a thing existed during the production. There was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers, the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains - five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath  gang up on her, why don't you?<br /><br />The only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it - which is, as the rest of the film, a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully.<br /><br />oh and by the way, this movie is NOTHING like The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand-held camera  this is an effect and not a trait! Used cleverly it can be breathtaking, but in this case it's an excuse for inadequate

{"value":"There are some extremely talented black directors Spike Lee,Carl Franklin,Billy Dukes,Denzel and a host of others who bring well deserved credit to the film industry . Then there are the Wayans Brothers who at one time(15,years ago) had an extremely funny television show'In Living Colour' that launched the career of Jim Carrey amongst others . Now we have stupidity substituting for humour and gross out gags(toilet humour) as the standard operating procedure . People are not as stupid as those portrayed in 'Little Man' they couldn't possibly be . A baby with a full set of teeth and a tattoo is accepted as being only months old ? Baby comes with a five o'clock shadow that he shaves off . It is intimated that the baby has sex with his foster mother behind her husbands,Darryl's, back .Oh, yea that is just hilarious . As a master criminal 'Little Man' is the stupidest on planet earth . He stashes a stolen rock that is just huge in a woman's purse and then has to pursue her . Co-star Chazz Palminteri,why Chazz, offers the best line: \"I'm surrounded by morons.\" Based, without credit, on a Chuck Jones cartoon, Baby Buggy Bunny . This is far too stupid to be even remotely funny . A clue as to how bad this film is Damon Wayans appeared on Jay Leno the other night,prior to the BAT awards and he did not,even mention this dreadful movie .

{"value":"I signed in just to comment on how awfully stupid this movie is. Besides being a rip-off of Executive Decision or Air Force One or any other kind of terrorist story, this is the kind of movie that makes you appreciate seeing a movie that can take the same basic ideas and do it well. It's hard to blame the actors when they are given such a stupid, cliché-ridden script to work with. It's bad enough if you groan once in a movie when you encounter an insult to your intelligence, but when you find yourself groaning over and over again, you have to conclude that the director also isn't the brightest bulb in the movie business, nor are the producers for deciding to bring this story to the screen in the first place. The mostly low-rent actors you can excuse for taking on this assignment, because they most likely showed up to get the money and exposure, not that being a part of this joke-of-a-movie is going to earn them any awards or recognition. It may end up embarrassing them for having such poor judgment as to get involved in such a loser. I see no point in summarizing the plot or even in giving any examples to prove my case, for, to do so, would be cruel and unusual punishment that no one involved in this debacle could withstand. Just as studying well-made movies can inspire you how to make a good, skillfully put-together work of art and beauty, the only thing that you can learn from watching this monstrosity is what NOT to do and what does NOT work!

{"value":"I love movies, and I'll watch any movie all the way through, just to give it a chance. I can finally say that I found a movie I can't watch all the way through. The acting is terribly stale and monotone, the CGI looks like a computer geek did it in his mother's basement with minimal software, and.....the long scenes of just...walking!!!! And this movie is THREE HOURS LONG!!! I didn't even make it 15 minutes until I fast forwarded the DVD. The scenes with the aliens are very short. Ummm, instead of naming this \"War of the Worlds\", lets name this \"War of the Walking Long Distances\". This cost 5 million dollars to make! What they spend the money on, the dramatic opening song?<br /><br />Oh, but on a positive note, one scene you need to watch is when the aliens first begin killing people. That's hilarious, not because people are dying, but because when they turn to skeletons, they still squirm for 20 seconds afterward.<br /><br />So....like I said, if you are a fan of boring, stale, action-less movies, here is one for you DVD collection. But I didn't write this for you, I wrote this for the billions upon billions of other people who will HATE this movie.

{"value":"This movie was made for people who found Gremlins too serious and Critters to hardcore. Like many of the critters/trolls/gremlins movies of the 80's this movie is bad. The sad part is that there's no punchline to that comment. It's just bad and not in a funny way.<br /><br />The problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and ends up being as successful in doing that as Howie Mandell was in Walk Like A Man. What made the other 80's horror movies into classics was that they were genuinely trying to be scary, but were hilarious because they failed so miserably. Someone must have told Bettina Hirsch (yes THE Bettina Hirsch)she had a knack for comedy before she started directing this movie. Unfortunately they were wrong.<br /><br />Sure seeing a weird little mutated cross between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trenchcoat and throwing pool balls at an outcast from the Lost Boys is amusing, but not enough to save the movie.<br /><br />By far the most annoying part of the movie is the Paul character. His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to make you start fast forwarding from the time of his first scene until the ending credits only stopping once to see a scene where a munchie throws pool

{"value":"<br /><br />When I first started watching this movie last night on Cinemax, I was shocked that it had been made. Cruel Intentions, in my opinion, was one of the best teen-oriented films made in years. This prequel had certain things incongruent with the original. (Sebastian's father married into wealth, then why does he have a rich Aunt on long island?)<br /><br />Then I found out today that it was not really intended to be a new movie, but rather a television series, Manchester Prep. After hearing that, it made sense to me that it wasn't the same as the movie, just as Buffy the Vampire Slayer is different in TV form. <br /><br />I think that Roger Kumble most likely added the ending that this movie had, AFTER the series wasn't picked up by Fox. It just seems like something that would happen too fast (Sebastian becoming the male version of Katharyn) and I just don't know where they would go with the next episode, since it wouldn't be leading to the 1999 Film (Which the newer ending is directed right towards.)<br /><br />One thing I didn't like was that it suggested Sebastian and his father had married into the wealth, which isn't typically looked good upon in this area of new york, and sine Katharyn's mother was just an adult version of her, it didn't seem like something a woman in her position would do, marry a man not of her social class. <br /><br />As a prequel this is fairly lame. But I would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series.","finished_norm":["br","br","when","i","start","watch","thi","movi","last","night","on","cinemax","i","be","shock","that","it","have","be","make","cruel","intent","in","my","opinion","be","on","of","the","well","teenori","film","make","in","year","thi","prequel","have","certain","thing","incongru","with","the","origin","sebastian","father","marri","into","wealth","then","why","doe","he","have","a","rich","aunt","on","long","islandbr","br","then","i","find","out","todai","that","it","be","not","realli","intend","to","be","a","new","movi","but","rather","a","televis","seri","manchest","prep","after","hear","that","it","make","sens","to","me","that","it","be","not","the","same","a","the","movi","just","a","buffi","the","vampir","slayer","be","differ","in","tv","form","br","br","i","think","that","roger","kumbl","much","like","add","the","end","that","thi","movi","have","after","the","seri","be","not","pick","up","by","fox","it","just","seem","like","someth","that","would","happen","too","fast","sebastian","becom","the","male","version","of","katharyn","and","i","just","do","not","know","where","thei","would","go","with","the","next","episod","sinc","it","would","not","be","lead","to","the","film","which","the","new","end","be","direct","right","towardsbr","br","on","thing","i","do","not","like","be","that","it","suggest","sebastian","and","hi","father","have","marri","into","the","wealth","which","be","not","typic","look","good","upon","in","thi","area","of","new","york","and","sine","katharyn","mother","be","just","a","adult","version","of","her","it","do","not","seem","like","someth","a","woman","in","her","posit","would","do","marri","a","man","not","of","her","social","class","br","br","a","a","prequel","thi","be","fairli","lame","but","i","would","have","be","interest","to","see","where","thi","have","go","a","a","seri"],"filtered":["br","br","start","watch","thi","movi","last","night","cinemax","shock","make","cruel","intent","opinion","well","teenori","film","make","year","thi","prequel","certain","thing","incongru","origin","sebastian","father","marri","wealth","doe","rich","aunt","long","islandbr","br","find","todai","realli","intend","new","movi","rather","televis","seri","manchest","prep","hear","make","sens","movi","buffi","vampir","slayer","differ","tv","form","br","br","think","roger","kumbl","much","like","add","end","thi","movi","seri","pick","fox","seem","like","someth","happen","fast","sebastian","becom","male","version","katharyn","know","thei","go","next","episod","sinc","lead","film","new","end","direct","right","towardsbr","br","thing","like","suggest","sebastian","hi","father","marri","wealth","typic","look","good","upon","thi","area","new","york","sine","katharyn","mother","adult","version","seem","like","someth","woman","posit","marri","man","social","class","br","br","prequel","thi","fairli","lame","interest","see","thi","go","seri"],"filtered2":["start","watch","last","night","cinemax","shock","make","cruel","intent","opinion","well","teenori","make","year","prequel","certain","thing","incongru","origin","sebastian","father","marri","wealth","doe","rich","aunt","long","islandbr","find","todai","realli","intend","new","rather","televis","manchest","prep","hear","make","sens","buffi","vampir","slayer","differ","tv","form","think","roger","kumbl","like","add","end","pick","fox","seem","like","someth","happen","fast","sebastian","becom","male","version","katharyn","know","go","next","sinc","lead","new","end","direct","right","towardsbr","thing","like","suggest","sebastian","father","marri","wealth","typic","look","good","upon","area","new","york","sine","katharyn","mother","adult","version","seem","like","someth","woman","posit","marri","man","social","class","prequel","fairli","lame","interest","see","go"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,12,13,16,18,20,24,26,29,35,38,45,53,57,60,69,70,71,87,94,99,102,115,121,144,157,160,162,172,173,204,210,216,220,297,299,343,373,397,446,485,508,509,538,542,613,628,630,646,649,663,689,733,734,774,789,811,819,827,926,937,975,1157,1479,1611,1984,2522,3394,3738,3963,5318,5496,6704,7185,7325],"values":[3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,12,13,16,18,20,24,26,29,35,38,45,53,57,60,69,70,71,87,94,99,102,115,121,144,157,160,162,172,173,204,210,216,220,297,299,343,373,397,446,485,508,509,538,542,613,628,630,646,649,663,689,733,734,774,789,811,819,827,926,937,975,1157,1479,1611,1984,2522,3394,3738,3963,5318,5496,6704,7185,7325],"values":[1.8599301468615699,2.5841531782306313,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.19661

{"value":"I am 17, and I still like most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what I saw of it, I wasn't impressed at all. First of all, I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and very Saturday- morning -cartoon -standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows I really hate had slightly better animation. Even worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune wasn't very good either, I can't even remember it, and the jokes were lame and contrived. Though, I do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might I add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was awful, and I am not trying to discredit it, it's what I personally feel. 1/10 Bethany

{"value":"I got lured by the title... I was expecting an insightful and intriguing journey into alcoholism, instead I got a rather boring and uninspiring story about a rowdy Scot.<br /><br />The leading character isn't given much psychological depth, unless you are willing to classify cheesy teen-like poetry as psychology.<br /><br />It was a shame, because the core of the story could have been good, with a better effort to depict the inner feelings of a man who had to live with alcohol and violence since his youth.<br /><br />Sadly, the general idea seems to be more like \"I'm the way I am because that's the way I am\". And the laughingly bad attempt at giving some sort of poetic edge to a lower-class man makes things even worse. Resorting to the overused cliché of the \"poète maudit\" reeks of a quick fix, a cheap way to make a dull movie seem smart, artsy and meaningful.<br /><br />But \"16 years of alcohol\" isn't much smart, artsy or meaningful... The leading character doesn't evolve at all, and the feeble attempt of changing fails without a good explanation. Just like the initial attempt happened rather out of the blue.<br /><br />The movie borrows heavily from classics such as A Clockwork Orange and Trainspotting, but it ultimately fails to recapture their greatness, not even for a few seconds.<br /><br />Jobson put too much emphasis on the artistic side of the story, and neglected the rest, giving us a movie which is pleasant to the eye but

{"value":"According to IMDb, as well as to every other website that holds a review; this \"thing\" doesn't have a director. Well, that would surely explain a lot! Just a bunch of people that gathered together to shoot some perverted porn sequences and throw in an ultra-thin storyline about devil-worshiping and women sacrifices inside the walls of a secluded sanitarium. \"Hardgore\" is a prime example of totally demented 70's smut, as it's really made with a minimum of production values and scripting inspiration. Horror movies about satanic cults were hugely popular during the early 70's and pornography as well, so why not combine the two? Here we have a simplistic story about a young nymphomaniac girl who's committed to a mental asylum, and from the first night already, she's drawn into a network of drugs, psychedelic orgies, rape, torture and dildo-action. Really, a LOT of dildo-action. The friendly lesbian nurse tries to warn her, but she has her throat slit even the same night. The horror aspects are truly poorly elaborated, going from laughably un-scary Satan masks to virulent severed penises attacks. The photography and acting performances are almost intolerably amateurish, but what do you expect from a film that features footage of sperm-firing dildos and talking amputated male reproduction organs? Leading lady Justina Lynn is a rather good looking girl with a ravishing body, but most of her co-stars (male & female) are hideous and excessively haired sleaze balls.","finished_norm":["accord","to","imdb","a","good","a","to","everi","other","websit","that","hold","a","review","thi","thing","doe","not","have","a","director","good","that","would","sure","explain","a","lot","just","a","bunch","of","peopl","that","gather","togeth","to","shoot","some","pervert","porn","sequenc","and","throw","in","a","ultrathin","storylin","about","devilworship","and","woman","sacrific","insid","the","wall","of","a","seclud","sanitarium","hardgor","be","a","prime","exampl","of","total","dement","smut","a","it","realli","make","with","a","minimum","of","product","valu","and","script","inspir","horror","movi","about","satan","cult","be","huge","popular","dure","the","earli","and","pornographi","a","good","so","why","not","combin","the","two","here","we","have","a","simplist","stori","about","a","young","nymphomaniac","girl","who","commit","to","a","mental","asylum","and","from","the","night","alreadi","she","draw","into","a","network","of","drug","psychedel","orgi","rape","tortur","and","dildoact","realli","a","lot","of","dildoact","the","friendli","lesbian","nurs","try","to","warn","her","but","she","have","her","throat","slit","even","the","same","night","the","horror","aspect","be","truli","poorli","elabor","go","from","laughabl","unscari","satan","mask","to","virul","sever","peni","attack","the","photographi","and","act","perform","be","almost","intoler","amateurish","but","what","do","you","expect","from","a","film","that","featur","footag","of","spermfir","dildo","and","talk","amput","male","reproduct","organ","lead","ladi","justina","lynn","be","a","rather","good","look","girl","with","a","ravish","bodi","but","much","of","her","costar","male","femal","be","hideou","and","excess","hair","sleaz","ball"],"filtered":["accord","imdb","good","everi","websit","hold","review","thi","thing","doe","director","good","sure","explain","lot","bunch","peopl","gather","togeth","shoot","pervert","porn","sequenc","throw","ultrathin","storylin","devilworship","woman","sacrific","insid","wall","seclud","sanitarium","hardgor","prime","exampl","total","dement","smut","realli","make","minimum","product","valu","script","inspir","horror","movi","satan","cult","huge","popular","dure","earli","pornographi","good","combin","two","simplist","stori","young","nymphomaniac","girl","commit","mental","asylum","night","alreadi","draw","network","drug","psychedel","orgi","rape","tortur","dildoact","realli","lot","dildoact","friendli","lesbian","nurs","try","warn","throat","slit","even","night","horror","aspect","truli","poorli","elabor","go","laughabl","unscari","satan","mask","virul","sever","peni","attack","photographi","act","perform","almost","intoler","amateurish","expect","film","featur","footag","spermfir","dildo","talk","amput","male","reproduct","organ","lead","ladi","justina","lynn","rather","good","look","girl","ravish","bodi","much","costar","male","femal","hideou","excess","hair","sleaz","ball"],"filtered2":["accord","imdb","good","everi","websit","hold","review","thing","doe","director","good","sure","explain","lot","bunch","peopl","gather","togeth","shoot","pervert","porn","sequenc","throw","ultrathin","storylin","devilworship","woman","sacrific","insid","wall","seclud","sanitarium","hardgor","prime","exampl","total","dement","smut","realli","make","minimum","product","valu","script","inspir","horror","satan","cult","huge","popular","dure","earli","pornographi","good","combin","two","simplist","stori","young","nymphomaniac","girl","commit","mental","asylum","night","alreadi","draw","network","drug","psychedel","orgi","rape","tortur","dildoact","realli","lot","dildoact","friendli","lesbian","nurs","try","warn","throat","slit","even","night","horror","aspect","truli","poorli","elabor","go","laughabl","unscari","satan","mask","virul","sever","peni","attack","photographi","act","perform","almost","intoler","amateurish","expect","featur","footag","spermfir","dildo","talk","amput","male","reproduct","organ","lead","ladi","justina","lynn","rather","good","look","girl","ravish","bodi","costar","male","femal","hideou","excess","hair","sleaz","ball"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,6,13,16,17,18,21,23,29,36,47,58,70,72,77,83,84,85,105,117,119,130,131,135,157,160,176,184,186,190,210,239,266,270,305,307,310,316,330,342,349,376,395,398,414,419,422,444,451,472,495,515,527,552,576,591,645,649,658,697,746,802,813,890,909,911,933,951,968,969,971,1085,1188,1239,1309,1340,1372,1379,1591,1791,1813,1919,1933,1986,2190,2201,2234,2300,2462,2538,2809,3002,3054,3103,3171,3333,3425,3956,4327,4636,4757,5369,5608,5745,5830,6299,6385,8182,8518,8528],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"It was everything this isn't: it had pace, pop, and actors who weren't afraid to chew the scenery. It also had a decent script. This one had me scratching my head. If Farrah isn't really \"serious\" about a career, why does she have a manager (and why is he wasting his time)? If Kate and Barney are \"artists,\" why do they sign up for The Mother of All Jiggle Shows (like the \"Brady Bunch\" movie where Robert Reed wants to do Shakespeare, only to find himself on BB)? They weren't industry names, but they weren't exactly starving, either. And while they got the history right (the poster was released before Farrah got the show), Silverman rejecting pitches for \"Funniest Home Videos\" and \"American Idol\" and Spelling promising his baby girl Tori someday he'll create a show for her obviously did not happen.<br /><br />What bothered me was how Spelling's role is distorted. He's shown as the show-runner and creator when he was neither. And how he \"comes up\" with the \"idea\" for CA was is laughable!<br /><br />How were Spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrah's oral contract when the others were signed? And why didn't Farrah or Bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her Inner Diva, but because Majors wanted her to? This is why, when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting Farrah up as the \"bad girl\" (like Suzanne Somers), it fails because the groundwork was never laid -- that was where the

{"value":"ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE (1940) is the ninth (9th) film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into. Characters ANDY HARDY (Mickey Rooney) and JUDGE HARDY (Lewis Stone) were going to be front and center. The rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks. The series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in.<br /><br />Lewis Stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic manner. The rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do. Mickey Rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve. ANDYs' reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way. Even after he returned as a veteran of World War II service in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY (1946) his reaction to any 'teapot tempest' was the same, juvenile.<br /><br />In this film it is clearly illustrated. ANDY gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved. This screen writing device was known as the 'idiot plot'. A means of stretching a poorly written scenario. Maybe it was less Mickey Rooneys' fault then the Director and the Writers. Most likely George B.

{"value":"I don't know why I keep doing this to myself!! I keep on defending the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get more credit and chances...and then they smack you around the head with junk like this! Intensive Care is a terrible production and probably the worst thing that was ever made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstrain American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers aimed really high with this, but fell really low. Intensive Care became an embarrassing product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. It's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions, like \"the Night of Distaste\". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a lame and low-brain slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very hilarious and cheap - make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is abominable, even though there are a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He never ever mentions this thing he starred in, though.

{"value":"Every now and again you hear radio djs inviting listeners to nominate movies that the listener can't stand or never watched all the way through. This is the movie that I think of...days later.<br /><br />It's got something to do with a play by Shakespeare. Not sure, but I think I bailed on this movie some 20 odd minutes into it...think I realised that my toenails wouldn't clip themselves, and they were looking at me imploringly to get cut.<br /><br />This movie just seemed boring and pretentious to me.<br /><br />Even though this is the first movie I've given such a low score to (which I've actually attempted to watch), I wouldn't want to put you off other movies by it's English director, Peter Greenaway. I remember thinking that his \"The cook, the thief, his wife and her lover\" was a truly great British film even though its content was at times stomach churning-a brilliant movie, but I can understand why people would balk at seeing it.<br /><br />Another good film by Greenaway was \"A zed and two noughts\". Again, it had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste, but was intriguing nonetheless.<br /><br />The other film that I usually think of too late for such radio show topics is \"Brazil\".

{"value":"First off, anyone who thinks this sequel to William Friedkin's \"The French Connection\", is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both. The problem with reviewing this film is that, a.) it's a sequel to a brilliant movie, which always makes watching it objectively difficult, and b.) it's directed by John Frankenhimer, one of the best American directors ever, so I wanted to like it. William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new York city, because of his documentary-like approach to the action and story, Frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever, i.e. \"The Manchurian Candidate\" and \"Seconds\", and with his \"French Connection 2\" it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off. That fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by Gene Hackman himself really tells a lot about Hackman's understanding about the original film too. It's well known Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again, it's also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional, loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character. it shows you Hackman, despite being a great actor, had no idea who to make the movie and the story great. The plot point of Doyle becoming an addict is interesting, but doesn't warrant the rest of the film.

{"value":"The over-heated plot of \"Bonjour tristesse\" is taken from a juvenile first novel by Francoise Sagan, which became a best-seller, though God knows why. For teenagers wanting to get rid of a potential step-parent it may have a certain appeal. Don't be taken in by the fact that David Niven plays the playboy father and Deborah Kerr the step-mother-in- prospect. Unfortunately, too much rests on the frail shoulders of Jean Seberg. She's beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can strike poses but she can't act. Anyone who saw her as Joan of Arc in Otto Preminger's St. Joan -- Seberg's first film -- knows she was incapable at 19 of carrying a film. This movie, also by Preminger, fulfills the \"promise\" of the first. It was her second movie; she was now 20. What was Preminger thinking? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg's lack of acting capacity? Not a chance? Seberg's character is at the center of the story and, pretty though she is, convincing though she may be physically as a 17 year old, she can't meet the emotional demands of the role. I don't know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she did not have an impact on my consciousness in her later pictures. But anyone who thinks this film is better than mediocre needs a taste check. In spite of Niven and Kerr, this remains a juvenile story executed in juvenile fashion by a beautiful young girl who badly needed acting

{"value":"Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws? Orca isn't exactly a \"Jaws rip off\" but it is obvious that it tried to profit from Jaws's success. First of all Orca in my opinion was a bad movie, not terrible but definitely not good, average at best.<br /><br />The plot is basically a male killer whale (orca) after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge. I couldn't stand to watch this movie again. The direction of this film is poor and when compared to Jaws it looks like the director, producers, and writers were almost talentless.<br /><br />As for the acting, it was very average and believable, however the actual characters aren't the least bit likable. The effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good.<br /><br />The violence is confusing, bloody, and not recommended for more sensitive people. The music is overdone and very loud, drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times. I hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale (killer whales don't mate with only one mate as depicted in Orca).<br /><br />Overall this movie was bad/poor in my opinion, because of the reasons listed above. Some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so I'm not going to bash this movie and I can understand why some people may like it.<br /><br

{"value":"Dietrich Bonhoeffer's writings have had a profound influence on my life as a Christian, and I eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life. Words can hardly express my disappointment. This movie was disjointed...it gave no background about his life, no historical context, and nothing about his great writings (except a brief, passing reference to \"The Cost of Discipleship\" by a colleague at the beginning of the movie.) Instead, we see him enjoying jazz (apparently in the States) and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to Germany. Apparently to show his human side. OK, I'm ready for the dramatic part. The part where he stands up for his faith. Instead of emphasizing that, we get a very badly acted romance with a 17-year-old schoolgirl. Whether or not that actually took place, it should not have been a major portion of the movie. Now...still waiting for the dramatic part, or some narration explaining what his writings were all about...or SOMETHING to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man. drum-roll.....waiting..... ....waiting.....ZIP. Nada. This is the kind of movie that gives \"Christian Films\" a bad name. All they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow, with some background...even some voice-overs, or flashbacks to him preaching from his works...some narrative about who he was and where he had been.

{"value":"\"The Crush\" is a pleasant enough 40-something friends romantic chick flick for the first two-thirds or so, as it tries to be a Brit \"Sex and the City\". <br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the turn-around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out (come to think of it we didn't see all that much physical flesh of him either and Kenny Doughty is worth seeing more of). <br /><br />They sure make a lot more deal of young man/older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of \"Sabrina\" (neither movie do I like) or for that matter with the Douglas/Zeta-Jones or Dion/Svengali nuptials.<br /><br />Surrounding Andie MacDowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from Brit dramas and comedies, such as tart-tongued Anna Chancellor. <br /><br />The plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina. But it wasn't until the credits came up at the end that I realized what might really be wrong. Just as with \"Sex and the City,\" the writer/director is male, here first-timer Scot John McKay, and I think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men, probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work (the characters are a school principal, a cop and a doctor), which would have been a better and more interesting movie. The working title for the film was \"The Sad F*cker's Club\" which would have made its parallels with the gay \"Broken Hearts Club\" even more obvious.<br /><br />(originally written

{"value":"\"What the Bleep Do We Know!?\" was one of the worst times I have spent at the movies. It was less of a movie and more of an after school special, but at the same time nothing special at all. The attempt at a narrative in which they grounded their ideas was absolutely pathetic, which almost anyone will tell you. Marlee Matlin in her underwear just shouldn't happen. I won't dwell on it. What I will reveal is a criticism that many are unable to formulate. This movie, while tedious, also suffered a tremendous flaw in reasoning. It was horribly contradictory because it took such a manipulative, become a creator of your life, manifestation of abundance, shoeless piece of propaganda. Interconnectivity is explained as a large party of our existence. However, the movie encourages that we control our surroundings with our minds. It completely neglects that there are other people with minds that could be controlling us, which seems to be more the case. Or at least the structures in which we exist greatly limit us. In this way, the movie was inappropriately solipsistic. Solipsism and interconnectivity just don't mix unless you're God almighty. If you are, you will be impressed (?!?) by all the neat things this movie will reveal that You can do. If not, you will be sorely disappointed, a moron, or perhaps both. Also, the title is so ridiculous, I have trouble warning people not to see the movie because I feel retarded mentioning it by name.
