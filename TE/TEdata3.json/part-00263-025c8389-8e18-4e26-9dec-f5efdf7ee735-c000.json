{"value":"Yuck! And again I say...YUCK! The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it. And, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.<br /><br />This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute. The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.<br /><br />There was no reason for this movie to have been made other than to make me angry...","finished_norm":["yuck","and","again","i","sayyuck","the","origin","version","of","thi","movi","be","a","good","direct","stori","of","a","man","who","be","alreadi","dead","and","drive","through","purgatori","the","origin","movi","have","a","lot","to","sai","and","do","not","go","out","of","it","wai","to","sai","it","and","it","have","a","nake","chick","on","a","motorcyclebr","br","thi","version","strike","me","a","someth","that","a","produc","bui","the","right","to","and","then","abandon","out","of","disinterest","it","look","a","if","a","group","of","individu","conscious","decid","to","fit","it","to","the","nineti","and","chang","ethnic","and","gender","just","to","be","cute","the","movi","be","not","about","a","burnout","about","to","commit","suicid","in","a","last","act","of","defianc","it","be","about","a","man","try","to","get","to","a","hospit","to","see","hi","wifebr","br","there","be","no","reason","for","thi","movi","to","have","be","make","other","than","to","make","me","angri"],"filtered":["yuck","sayyuck","origin","version","thi","movi","good","direct","stori","man","alreadi","dead","drive","purgatori","origin","movi","lot","sai","go","wai","sai","nake","chick","motorcyclebr","br","thi","version","strike","someth","produc","bui","right","abandon","disinterest","look","group","individu","conscious","decid","fit","nineti","chang","ethnic","gender","cute","movi","burnout","commit","suicid","last","act","defianc","man","try","get","hospit","see","hi","wifebr","br","reason","thi","movi","make","make","angri"],"filtered2":["yuck","sayyuck","origin","version","good","direct","stori","man","alreadi","dead","drive","purgatori","origin","lot","go","wai","nake","chick","motorcyclebr","version","strike","someth","produc","bui","right","abandon","disinterest","look","group","individu","conscious","decid","fit","nineti","chang","ethnic","gender","cute","burnout","commit","suicid","last","act","defianc","man","try","get","hospit","see","wifebr","reason","make","make","angri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,16,17,21,33,36,45,53,69,72,95,102,121,144,220,228,249,261,278,330,347,410,461,676,855,893,969,1041,1056,1143,1161,1373,1486,1537,3353,3666,4174,4317,5968,7442],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,16,17,21,33,36,45,53,69,72,95,102,121,144,220,228,249,261,278,330,347,410,461,676,855,893,969,1041,1056,1143,1161,1373,1486,1537,3353,3666,4174,4317,5968,7442],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,3.632592212924433,1.7003182735607676,4.254065042302116,1.9209463754160525,2.0323326556775485,2.087553710177271,2.2190595059394194,2.2931108769894046,5.667386841755453,2.7742700004069256,2.6754694156628323,2.7085302779237206,2.8336934208777267,2.9292757465539174,3.0151989841543516,3.2070272508030975,3.358217889001879,3.6105180246075443,3.9201351739255808,4.017463517886143,4.0536665665501035,4.176068548062782,4.100845126825194,4.436351646326448,4.327618446189983,4.456830177669989,4.558366596889411,4.613282354485526,5.583416318380505,5.7959777603641776,5.967828017290836,5.967828017290836,6.389041482367141,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.50808460972783E-4,2.505862069158133E-4,2.506480785860337E-4,2.505976903047264E-4,2.506214064035925E-4,2.5058482525906577E-4,2.506627606186687E-4,2.5054754232407145E-4,2.505862598746464E-4,2.508452136206053E-4,2.5283559737960366E-4,2.505866737783479E-4,2.508239951938733E-4,2.508501267267698E-4,2.5073617206405776E-4,2.5059867737275824E-4,2.506848930096251E-4,2.508028661725361E-4,2.5061161470196704E-4,2.5061069844103885E-4,2.508361608610075E-4,2.506358070744794E-4,2.506361863900526E-4,2.5079674661457357E-4,2.5061170510388693E-4,2.508531250049424E-4,2.5067441971279007E-4,2.50585645300128E-4,2.506992501229479E-4,2.507757671478343E-4,2.5063703648367763E-4,2.5077127222240684E-4,2.508943946566083E-4,2.5112726355820144E-4,2.506739865403454E-4,2.5059852538068784E-4,2.50688880301384E-4,2.5062397600113863E-4,2.505478097371297E-4,2.5061153709162826E-4,2.508626926787704E-4,2.5072507870075754E-4,2.507718436869293E-4,2.5056027947365384E-4,2.5061160081579347E-4,2.505984311460742E-4,2.50683256442923E-4,2.5072672523291837E-4,2.5067574137014513E-4,2.5063600882225677E-4,2.5059905085673826E-4,2.511124876152886E-4,2.5066210879661816E-4,2.506115433759327E-4,2.506607664081856E-4,2.505859016833082E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867716E-4,2.505994026657311E-4,2.5058575864248515E-4,2.5078623326048414E-4,2.506855613798027E-4,2.505856538910584E-4,2.505601773897301E-4,2.505349807961615E-4,2.5076150407809313E-4,2.505979299011485E-4,2.5071184239933207E-4,2.5078541996925854E-4,2.506716435043774E-4,

{"value":"The performances of Fishbourne (who appears strangely funny somehow) and (short featured)Ed Harris are remarkable, unlike Connery's who doesn't appear to find sense in his role and ends up in the motorial behaviour of a 80yr old man. In fact the screenplay doesn't make sense; imagine a 60 min. happy ending-plot plus a sudden turn appendix without any argumental structure in respect to the characters. It's more an accident than a screenplay and may be good for examination purposes at screen-wrights' schools. The more you remind the details the stronger this impression gets. The capital punishment is not an issue here, although it is a subject from the beginning; it sort of fades away without further comment.

{"value":"I must pat myself on the back for watching this movie all the way through because it truly was painful. An incapable painter becomes a fully capable hit-man? This movie was rife with absurdities of which if I mentioned them all I would be giving away the movie. Norm Peterson aka George Wendt must really be in a rut to have agreed to do this movie. The acting was deplorable and the story was even worse. As a sane minded and rational individual, I could not understand where the writer came from nor where he was going with this movie. There was ineptness on the part of every main character, there was a string of hapless and ridiculous events, then the movie ended.

{"value":"This film reminds me of how college students used to protest against the Vietnam War. As if, upon hearing some kids were doing without cheeseburgers in Cow Dung Collehe, the President was going to immediately change all US foreign policy.<br /><br />The worst thing is that, while dangerous, the concept of a policy based on if the USSR and US went to war it could mean the end of the world, WORKED. The US and USSR NEVER WENT TO WAR.<br /><br />Had we only conventional weapons, the notion of yet another war, a \"win-able\" war, in Europe and Asia was not unthinkable.<br /><br />Not that I think they should get rid of this movie.

{"value":"I tried restarting the movie twice. I put it in three machines to see what was wrong. Did Steven Seagal's voice change? Did he die during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone who doesn't even resemble him? Or was the sound on the DVD destroyed? After about 10 minutes, you finally hear the actor's real voice. Though throughout most of the film, it sounds like the audio was recorded in a bathroom.<br /><br />I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to Goodwill, if I owned a copy. I rented it, but I will never do that again. I will check this database before renting any more of his movies, all of which were (more or less) good movies. You usually knew what you were getting when you watched a Steven Seagal movie. I guess that is no more.","finished_norm":["i","try","restart","the","movi","twice","i","put","it","in","three","machin","to","see","what","be","wrong","do","steven","seagal","voic","chang","do","he","die","dure","film","and","the","studio","have","to","dub","the","sound","with","someon","who","doe","not","even","resembl","him","or","be","the","sound","on","the","dvd","destroi","after","about","minut","you","final","hear","the","actor","real","voic","though","throughout","much","of","the","film","it","sound","like","the","audio","be","record","in","a","bathroombr","br","i","would","be","asham","to","donat","a","copi","of","thi","movi","to","goodwil","if","i","own","a","copi","i","rent","it","but","i","will","never","do","that","again","i","will","check","thi","databas","befor","rent","ani","much","of","hi","movi","all","of","which","be","much","or","littl","good","movi","you","usual","know","what","you","be","get","when","you","watch","a","steven","seagal","movi","i","guess","that","be","no","much"],"filtered":["try","restart","movi","twice","put","three","machin","see","wrong","steven","seagal","voic","chang","die","dure","film","studio","dub","sound","someon","doe","even","resembl","sound","dvd","destroi","minut","final","hear","actor","real","voic","though","throughout","much","film","sound","like","audio","record","bathroombr","br","asham","donat","copi","thi","movi","goodwil","copi","rent","never","check","thi","databas","befor","rent","ani","much","hi","movi","much","littl","good","movi","usual","know","get","watch","steven","seagal","movi","guess","much"],"filtered2":["try","restart","twice","put","three","machin","see","wrong","steven","seagal","voic","chang","die","dure","studio","dub","sound","someon","doe","even","resembl","sound","dvd","destroi","minut","final","hear","actor","real","voic","though","throughout","sound","like","audio","record","bathroombr","asham","donat","copi","goodwil","copi","rent","never","check","databas","befor","rent","ani","littl","good","usual","know","get","watch","steven","seagal","guess"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,7,14,18,25,26,27,36,41,42,59,79,80,86,139,156,159,178,216,224,239,243,247,265,278,293,428,438,505,661,738,747,932,949,1020,1053,1071,1194,1255,1402,1584,3041,4394],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,7,14,18,25,26,27,36,41,42,59,79,80,86,139,156,159,178,216,224,239,243,247,265,278,293,428,438,505,661,738,747,932,949,1020,1053,1071,1194,1255,1402,1584,3041,4394],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.8693254449200722,1.9469506069506084,1.9951803900462557,2.031112399272319,2.2939035841256437,2.3451551414151686,2.300267965194495,7.598499768136172,2.6070186965339692,2.689504733779216,2.6593400337329487,2.627841366673578,2.7303758068497004,2.73529586597515,2.8336934208777267,2.9012296278682137,6.7442140023250925,3.1797351085150902,3.41740676039221,7.145555393249395,3.7398317812878634,7.493177127501487,4.058285512406398,4.086456389373095,4.100845126825194,4.067587905068712,4.30366520516749,8.998179973919743,4.291900363587903,11.16683263676101,4.597282013139085,5.463272006538442,6.0662680901040895]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164666E-4,2.2324275812784218E-4,2.2329787848933367E-4,2.2325298847310007E-4,2.232741167202932E-4,2.2324152723462225E-4,2.2331095844892404E-4,2.2320831253640853E-4,2.2324280530791694E-4,2.2347350255652812E-4,2.2524669975505126E-4,2.232431740473023E-4,2.2345459944065005E-4,2.2347787955470628E-4,2.233763593891774E-4,2.2325386783430916E-4,2.2333067579914008E-4,2.234357759744349E-4,2.2326539346890386E-4,2.232645771884737E-4,2.2346543761534026E-4,2.2328694601974765E-4,2.2328728394518978E-4,2.234303241699845E-4,2.2326547400635315E-4,2.2348055066696395E-4,2.2332134532680116E-4,2.232422577944993E-4,2.2334346629394178E-4,2.234116339392788E-4,2.232880412783561E-4,2.2340762949082027E-4,2.2351731705956898E-4,2.2372477578809873E-4,2.2332095942123798E-4,2.232537324272992E-4,2.2333422800586636E-4,2.23276405928668E-4,2.2320855076990678E-4,2.2326532432724475E-4,2.2348907433600588E-4,2.2336647651074388E-4,2.234081385983156E-4,2.2321965983456373E-4,2.2326538109796083E-4,2.232536484753718E-4,2.233292178112128E-4,2.2336794337671966E-4,2.2332252276763831E-4,2.2328712575322472E-4,2.2325420056448948E-4,2.2371161216552587E-4,2.2331037775234796E-4,2.2326532992581892E-4,2.2330918184256562E-4,2.2324248620167697E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760425E-4,2.2325451398481244E-4,2.2324235876917278E-4,2.2342095801135593E-4,2.2333127123814588E-4,2.2324226544800512E-4,2.2321956888982672E-4,2.2

Notable as Broderick Crawford's first appearance - as gopher \"Hunk\"; other than running errands, Mr. Crawford gets pinned to the floor by Mr. McCrea. <br /><br />*** Woman Chases Man (4/28/37) John G.

{"value":"What a disappointment... admittedly the best of the prequels, but the story is weak, the plot is rushed and the end result is just a collection of set pieces, poorly realised and tacked together amateurishly. There are numerous continuity errors that clash glaringly with the original films, and the emergence of Darth Vader was handled so terribly that what could have been a legendary moment in modern cinema is now instead a cheesy goof that will be ridiculed for many years. I won't complain about the abysmal dialogue, as this is Star Wars... the original three films had style, cult feeling and cracking stories, and the strange dialogue added charm. The prequels were shallow attempts to make more money, and this lack of love shows in spades.

{"value":"Amateurish in the extreme. Camera work especially overwrought - documentary camera operators needn't spin around ALL THE TIME.<br /><br />The script is truly inane, and the acting is even worse. On top of that, the story is disjointed and meandering - with some gaping holes in logic. At one point the lead wishes to get thrown in jail in order to rub shoulders with suspected Al-Quada operatives, and thus get an interview with Osama. I found the story entirely unbelievable as a result of so many flaws. The \"filmmaker\"/lead role really portrays a rash, idiot frat boy. The only item of interest really, is that the filmmakers did in fact film on location.

{"value":"Dark Rising is your typical bad, obviously quickly produced horror/sci-fi/fantasy movie. It has a strange, unexplained plot with holes so big you could fit an elephant through them. Most of the time I didn't know what the hell was going on but it didn't really matter, it was a simple demon hunter returns from hell dimension to save campers story with confusing stuff added on about witches and a book of evil with plot elements and characters who make no sense or disappear totally for no reason. The acting is bad but there honestly is not much they can do with this script I am guessing. There is a couple topless scenes which is probably the only reason this bad movie got made (like so many other bad movies).

{"value":"What are people on here talking about? I must have seen a different movie than you guys. I was so bored that I walked out of the theater. What is up with this stuff. I only laughed once and not even that hard. Whoever greenlit this movie should be taken out into the street and beaten. I usually always find something I like in a movie, but this is crazy. \"Slackers\" makes \"Not Another Teen Movie\" look like a classic. It ranks up there with such trash as \"Body Shots\", \"Con Air\", and \"Conspiracy Theory\" as one of the worst of all time. AVOID AT ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would be handing out money to people as they left the theater as a sign of their apologies, but to my dismay that wasn't happening.

{"value":"OK - I ADORE this film...I will credit this movie - alone - for making me such a die-hard horror fanatic. I could never watch this movie alone. I've also heard many many stories of the effect it had in it's original release at the theatres , on its viewers. Incredible masterpiece.... Horrible , psychological stuff scares the pants off me .Oh bless their hearts, whoever made this awesome film. I love it. I thought the whole film was decent and interesting. This movie is SO scary - this is the scariest movie I have ever seen in my life! Not that what happens in the film and the idea of the film are not scary enough , but what always got me - was Brendan's fabulous acting. Best horror film EVER. Nothing can ever be this scary again.

{"value":"an acted/manipulated documentary about one of the most darkest places of guatemala. portrayed as a fun, secure... but sad place, were a bunch of sex workers get to play in a soccer team, assembled in what seems like no more than a week! the documentary's main focus is to prove that society repels this kind of \"workers\", even though no solution to these poor women is ever achieved, except that the people who documented this,made them some sort of \"stars\" (just like the title says so) in exchange of being exploited for making this realityshowlike documentary. it does have,

{"value":"While it does crack the odd good joke, the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes.<br /><br />Unlike what an other comment says I don't think this is the best RTE have ever made, its really dry and sarcastic. Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud. People seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren't really that good. Overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre. Its not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens stuff.

{"value":"I am sad that a period of history that is so fascinating and so rich in material for film can be made into a ho-hum event . Wm C Quantrill was barely shown in the film , probably the most intriquing figure of the period. Frank James was never mentioned, Cole Younger , ditto , and Bloody Bill Anderson , who would weep for his murdered sister every time he went into battle was completely absent in the script. Instead we were forced to watch fictitious characters that never developed into anyone we cared about. how sad. The costumes were wonderful however, as was the location shooting in Missouri.

{"value":"The fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour. In fact there are more questions than answers in this one-sided tale of romance and murder; and since we are only provided with the prosecution's side, none of these questions will be answered. This is the type of fare that appeals to the \"He Woman, Man Hater\" clubs of America. As presented, it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be \"caught up\" in a romance with a married, high-profile attorney. Is it possible that IF, she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man, the whole nasty murderous, sordid incident could have been avoided?

{"value":"Perhaps because I was so young, innocent and BRAINWASHED when I saw it, this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me. I haven't seen it since I was in seventh grade at a Presbyterian school, so I am not sure what effect it would have on me now. However, I will say that it left an impression on me... and most of my friends. It did serve its purpose, at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions. I was particularly terrified of what the newly-converted post-rapture Christians had to endure when not receiving the mark of the beast. I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it so I will not mention details of the scenes, but I can still picture them in my head... and it's been 19

{"value":"(Spoilers)<br /><br />I was very curious to see this film, after having heard that it was clever and witty. I had to stop halfway because of the unbearable boredom I felt.<br /><br />The idea behind the film would have been acceptable: depicting the way the relationship between a man and a woman evolves, through all the problems and difficulties that two people living in a big city can experience. What made me dislike the whole film were two things.<br /><br />First of all, the film was so down-to-earth that it looked as if, by describing the problems that a couple must solve on a day-to-day basis, it became itself ordinary and dull.<br /><br />Secondly, the overall sloppiness of the production, with dialogues that were barely understandable.<br /><br />Too bad.","finished_norm":["spoilersbr","br","i","be","veri","curiou","to","see","thi","film","after","have","hear","that","it","be","clever","and","witti","i","have","to","stop","halfwai","becaus","of","the","unbear","boredom","i","feltbr","br","the","idea","behind","the","film","would","have","be","accept","depict","the","wai","the","relationship","between","a","man","and","a","woman","evolv","through","all","the","problem","and","difficulti","that","two","peopl","live","in","a","big","citi","can","experi","what","make","me","dislik","the","whole","film","be","two","thingsbr","br","of","all","the","film","be","so","downtoearth","that","it","look","a","if","by","describ","the","problem","that","a","coupl","must","solv","on","a","daytodai","basi","it","becom","itself","ordinari","and","dullbr","br","secondli","the","overal","sloppi","of","the","product","with","dialogu","that","be","bare","understandablebr","br","too","bad"],"filtered":["spoilersbr","br","veri","curiou","see","thi","film","hear","clever","witti","stop","halfwai","becaus","unbear","boredom","feltbr","br","idea","behind","film","accept","depict","wai","relationship","man","woman","evolv","problem","difficulti","two","peopl","live","big","citi","experi","make","dislik","whole","film","two","thingsbr","br","film","downtoearth","look","describ","problem","coupl","must","solv","daytodai","basi","becom","ordinari","dullbr","br","secondli","overal","sloppi","product","dialogu","bare","understandablebr","br","bad"],"filtered2":["spoilersbr","veri","curiou","see","hear","clever","witti","stop","halfwai","becaus","unbear","boredom","feltbr","idea","behind","accept","depict","wai","relationship","man","woman","evolv","problem","difficulti","two","peopl","live","big","citi","experi","make","dislik","whole","two","thingsbr","downtoearth","look","describ","problem","coupl","must","solv","daytodai","basi","becom","ordinari","dullbr","secondli","overal","sloppi","product","dialogu","bare","understandablebr","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,9,15,16,22,23,33,45,47,70,82,111,115,116,123,141,167,190,216,248,253,315,333,393,412,577,594,595,668,741,955,1011,1396,1515,1596,1766,1798,1957,1961,2006,2032,2274,2478,2725,3680,3887,5220,6349],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,9,15,16,22,23,33,45,47,70,82,111,115,116,123,141,167,190,216,248,253,315,333,393,412,577,594,595,668,741,955,1011,1396,1515,1596,1766,1798,1957,1961,2006,2032,2274,2478,2725,3680,3887,5220,6349],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.4018535447685214,1.8162961064622165,3.412938870621443,2.094675786251684,2.020196584395323,2.1183455303375887,2.201553588425805,2.2466628996789315,2.2619070973220485,2.2657547357741192,4.9219153375776195,2.558331832813986,2.6070186965339692,2.689504733779216,2.7073305177318163,2.854312708080462,2.948928684455311,3.120015873813468,3.107414446935464,3.604618302480356,3.496027715008137,3.6284289511740746,3.5813614403160887,3.7165362186843414,4.017463517886143,4.086456389373095,4.409683399244287,4.605250182788262,4.613282354485526,4.715065048795469,4.85885294158718,4.911775343041523,4.838444069955973,4.956227105612356,4.890269137820559,5.0768550934009715,5.129498826886393,5.274680836730892,5.695894301807195,5.7959777603641776,6.1754673820690815,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918333E-4,2.3612552253122045E-4,2.3618382374676015E-4,2.3613634324334547E-4,2.3615869074724877E-4,2.361242206063241E-4,2.3619765851711896E-4,2.3608908917345165E-4,2.3612557243393576E-4,2.363695826263902E-4,2.3824510646673085E-4,2.3612596245232103E-4,2.3634958866039724E-4,2.363742122098562E-4,2.362668335771337E-4,2.3613727335022432E-4,2.362185137048157E-4,2.363296789404441E-4,2.3614946409949655E-4,2.3614860071362583E-4,2.3636105227822508E-4,2.36172260392521E-4,2.3617261781876976E-4,2.36323912526405E-4,2.3614954928455453E-4,2.3637703746512035E-4,2.3620864479495732E-4,2.3612499332492944E-4,2.3623204230611863E-4,2.3630414373063927E-4,2.3617341885568189E-4,2.3629990819577733E-4,2.3641592555151677E-4,2.3663535618876816E-4,2.362082366197784E-4,2.3613713012922468E-4,2.3622227090024014E-4,2.361611120599409E-4,2.3608934115479127E-4,2.3614939096785044E-4,2.3638605301314208E-4,2.3625638038324832E-4,2.3630044668255458E-4,2.361010912949479E-4,2.3614945101465827E-4,2.3613704133264781E-4,2.3621697158016151E-4,2.3625793189828025E-4,2.3620989018287162E-4,2.3617245049795395E-4,2.3613762528140609E-4,2.366214329274517E-4,2.3619704431003958E-4,2.361493968895039E-4,2.3619577938738487E-4,2.3612523491289687E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276096E-4,2.3613795678840838E-4,2.3612510012659113E-4,2.3631400587089318E-4,2.362191435050724E-4,2.3612500

{"value":"This is one of the most insipid, lackluster, unoriginal, and pointless movies ever made! It almost feels like everyone involved in this project didn't even try to make an appealing movie. This is nothing more than a continuation of a tiresome series of films that attempt to cash in on the success of Smokey and the Bandit, which I think is the best film of them all. As for this waste of film stock, Burt Reynolds sleepwalks his way through the entire movie, Jim Nabors is wasted, the other actors aren't given very much to do, the car races are obviously stock footage, the humor is uninspired, and many of the scenes are more dull and lifeless than staring at a wall for two hours. \"Stroker Ace\" is simply a superfluous film with nothing unique or

{"value":"I love Anthony Hopkins as an actor so I was very interested to see how he would do as a writer/director. I could not have been more disappointed by this move. The movie was so disjointed and the cinematography was so over done to the point I wanted to pull the plug out of the wall. The actors were very good but it was such a waste of talent. Not all actors are cut out to be writers or directors and clearly Mr. Hopkins falls into this category. Of all the movies I have ever seen in my 50 years, this is absolutely the worst movie ever. Please do us all a favor Mr. Hopkins and stick to acting, which you are excellent at, and leave the writing and directing to those who are talented in those areas. If I could give this movie a rating less than one I certainly would.","finished_norm":["i","love","anthoni","hopkin","a","a","actor","so","i","be","veri","interest","to","see","how","he","would","do","a","a","writerdirector","i","can","not","have","be","much","disappoint","by","thi","move","the","movi","be","so","disjoint","and","the","cinematographi","be","so","over","do","to","the","point","i","want","to","pull","the","plug","out","of","the","wall","the","actor","be","veri","good","but","it","be","such","a","wast","of","talent","not","all","actor","be","cut","out","to","be","writer","or","director","and","clearli","mr","hopkin","fall","into","thi","categori","of","all","the","movi","i","have","ever","see","in","my","year","thi","be","absolut","the","wrong","movi","ever","pleas","do","u","all","a","favor","mr","hopkin","and","stick","to","act","which","you","be","excel","at","and","leav","the","write","and","direct","to","that","who","be","talent","in","that","area","if","i","can","give","thi","movi","a","rate","littl","than","on","i","certainli","would"],"filtered":["love","anthoni","hopkin","actor","veri","interest","see","writerdirector","much","disappoint","thi","move","movi","disjoint","cinematographi","point","want","pull","plug","wall","actor","veri","good","wast","talent","actor","cut","writer","director","clearli","mr","hopkin","fall","thi","categori","movi","ever","see","year","thi","absolut","wrong","movi","ever","pleas","u","favor","mr","hopkin","stick","act","excel","leav","write","direct","talent","area","give","thi","movi","rate","littl","certainli"],"filtered2":["love","anthoni","hopkin","actor","veri","interest","see","writerdirector","disappoint","move","disjoint","cinematographi","point","want","pull","plug","wall","actor","veri","good","wast","talent","actor","cut","writer","director","clearli","mr","hopkin","fall","categori","ever","see","year","absolut","wrong","ever","pleas","u","favor","mr","hopkin","stick","act","excel","leav","write","direct","talent","area","give","rate","littl","certainli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,14,15,21,25,30,37,41,44,54,57,58,60,65,66,74,89,102,112,169,187,202,222,275,276,287,303,346,357,389,416,494,544,580,629,1085,1110,1157,1473,1712,2186,2247,3168,4329],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,14,15,21,25,30,37,41,44,54,57,58,60,65,66,74,89,102,112,169,187,202,222,275,276,287,303,346,357,389,416,494,544,580,629,1085,1110,1157,1473,1712,2186,2247,3168,4329],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.4876543214774305,4.70627975028631,3.209458785004948,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,1.9486336368009016,1.9940046109572438,2.087553710177271,2.2466628996789315,2.4071371113909277,2.4732161909892554,2.597304642813496,2.5771019354959765,2.7832848715031413,5.576945901169839,2.841890188081905,2.868298950055202,3.023389038124396,6.565922303288567,3.0914425013694116,3.1401446412440817,3.3243163373261977,3.4222967456864013,3.5039747767006686,3.488143311483988,4.176068548062782,4.1554492608600455,4.2860694432771105,4.535724120139652,4.85885294158718,5.02684467282631,5.064116067623542,17.63464757580345,5.967828017290836]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164652E-4,2.2324275812784207E-4,2.2329787848933356E-4,2.2325298847309996E-4,2.232741167202931E-4,2.2324152723462214E-4,2.2331095844892393E-4,2.2320831253640842E-4,2.2324280530791683E-4,2.2347350255652802E-4,2.2524669975505115E-4,2.2324317404730218E-4,2.2345459944064991E-4,2.2347787955470617E-4,2.2337635938917726E-4,2.2325386783430905E-4,2.2333067579913997E-4,2.234357759744348E-4,2.2326539346890375E-4,2.232645771884736E-4,2.2346543761534015E-4,2.2328694601974754E-4,2.2328728394518967E-4,2.234303241699844E-4,2.2326547400635305E-4,2.2348055066696385E-4,2.2332134532680102E-4,2.232422577944992E-4,2.2334346629394167E-4,2.234116339392787E-4,2.2328804127835598E-4,2.2340762949082016E-4,2.2351731705956887E-4,2.2372477578809863E-4,2.2332095942123787E-4,2.232537324272991E-4,2.2333422800586622E-4,2.2327640592866788E-4,2.2320855076990667E-4,2.2326532432724464E-4,2.2348907433600578E-4,2.2336647651074378E-4,2.234081385983155E-4,2.2321965983456362E-4,2.232653810979607E-4,2.2325364847537165E-4,2.233292178112127E-4,2.2336794337671955E-4,2.233225227676382E-4,2.2328712575322458E-4,2.2325420056448937E-4,2.2371161216552576E-4,2.2331037775234785E-4,2.232653299258188E-4,2.2330918184256551E-4,2.2324248620167686E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760414E-4,2.2325451398481233E-4,2.2324235876917264E-4,2.2342095801135582E-4,2.2333127123814575E-4,2.23242265448005E-4,2.232195688898266E-4,2.231971216964518E-4,2.233989272262174E-4,2.232532019252559E-4,2.2335468452716254E-4,2.2342023346478721E-4,2.233

{"value":"Outside of the fact that George Lopez is a pretentious jerk, his show is terrible.<br /><br />Nothing about Lopez has ever been funny. I have watched his stand-up and have never uttered any resemblance to a laugh.<br /><br />His stuff comes across as vindictive and his animosity towards white people oozes out of every single pore of his body.<br /><br />I have laughed at white people jokes from many a comedian and love many of them.<br /><br />This guy has a grudge that won't end.<br /><br />I feel bad for Hispanics who have only

{"value":"Quite average even by Monogram standards, this mystery (a remake of The Sphinx) has an oddball plot which is not unraveled to much effect -- you'll see through it after about ten minutes. The two leads have some nice breezy dialog at the outset, but John Hamilton is hopelessly dull as the villain (perfectly cast Lionel Atwill originated the role) and Warren Hymer's nitwit shtick is pretty annoying. However, it's worth sitting through for a five-minute appearance by the incomparable Mantan Moreland as Nicodemus the janitor, who gets the better of the defense attorney during a hilarious courtroom appearance.

{"value":"For months I've been hearing about this little movie and now I've seen it. I find it cute, cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other people's creative ideas in order to make their own one-joke premise of a movie. Troops, Swingblade, any of the million Blair Witch parodies come to mind. If all that these directors want is a foot inside Hollywood's door then they're doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how Hollywood makes films. How many times have you heard the phrase, \"It's Animal House meets Back to the Future\"; \"It's Wall Street meets Dead Poet's Society\"; or \"Shakespeare in Love meets Star Wars\"?

{"value":"After watching this I thought to myself, there are either too few good writers & directors or lots of producers.<br /><br />At any rate, this is a terrible movie. Terrible in a way that it's not fun, but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver. Makes you shout \"this is wrong\" at the movie. Immersion is zero. By now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors/weirdness-es in movies that has computers hackers etc. in them. This movie is like that in every aspect. <br /><br />The only good thing about the movie is the little girl Emily, brilliantly played by Eliza Bennett. I hope she becomes big, and make this ..thing at least worth something.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Don't watch this. There is not even proper action in it.

{"value":"Christ. A sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time, this at least has the decency to leave out the songs (bar a reprise of the unbearable \"Tomorrow\") but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny. This time, Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in Joan Collins's plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some such shite. The movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is: every time the little bugger squeals \"Leapin' lizards!\" I could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder. Drearily photographed, slushy and plodding, the movie has only one memorable line (\"Unhand me, you stupid genius!\") and the fact that it's not the original to recommend it.","finished_norm":["christ","a","sequel","to","on","of","the","much","cloi","film","of","all","time","thi","at","littl","have","the","decenc","to","leav","out","the","song","bar","a","repris","of","the","unbear","tomorrow","but","doe","continu","the","tradit","of","be","nauseat","and","unfunni","thi","time","anni","and","her","friend","head","off","to","london","and","get","catch","up","in","joan","collin","plot","to","blow","up","buckingham","palac","or","some","such","shite","the","movi","have","a","bizarr","sycophant","attitud","toward","it","eponym","charact","at","odd","with","how","irrit","she","be","everi","time","the","littl","bugger","squeal","leapin","lizard","i","can","feel","my","tooth","grind","themselv","down","into","powder","drearili","photograph","slushi","and","plod","the","movi","have","onli","on","memor","line","unhand","me","you","stupid","geniu","and","the","fact","that","it","not","the","origin","to","recommend","it"],"filtered":["christ","sequel","much","cloi","film","time","thi","littl","decenc","leav","song","bar","repris","unbear","tomorrow","doe","continu","tradit","nauseat","unfunni","thi","time","anni","friend","head","london","get","catch","joan","collin","plot","blow","buckingham","palac","shite","movi","bizarr","sycophant","attitud","toward","eponym","charact","odd","irrit","everi","time","littl","bugger","squeal","leapin","lizard","feel","tooth","grind","themselv","powder","drearili","photograph","slushi","plod","movi","onli","memor","line","unhand","stupid","geniu","fact","origin","recommend"],"filtered2":["christ","sequel","cloi","time","littl","decenc","leav","song","bar","repris","unbear","tomorrow","doe","continu","tradit","nauseat","unfunni","time","anni","friend","head","london","get","catch","joan","collin","plot","blow","buckingham","palac","shite","bizarr","sycophant","attitud","toward","eponym","charact","odd","irrit","everi","time","littl","bugger","squeal","leapin","lizard","feel","tooth","grind","themselv","powder","drearili","photograph","slushi","plod","onli","memor","line","unhand","stupid","geniu","fact","origin","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,8,10,11,14,18,32,43,69,74,85,97,107,136,161,208,298,328,387,433,436,512,563,754,772,823,948,958,1064,1070,1074,1092,1212,1312,1341,1450,1822,1931,1935,1961,2440,2482,3589,4350,4992,5056,5076,5390,5466,6829,7579,8264],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,8,10,11,14,18,32,43,69,74,85,97,107,136,161,208,298,328,387,433,436,512,563,754,772,823,948,958,1064,1070,1074,1092,1212,1312,1341,1450,1822,1931,1935,1961,2440,2482,3589,4350,4992,5056,5076,5390,5466,6829,7579,8264],"values":[0.7966340470719924,2.825681057716235,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,2.2350163994518417,1.2153159934048174,1.3711311285073675,1.6608112036218214,2.127032521151058,1.9486336368009016,2.011190219103739,2.0545557924622586,2.1439533986393955,2.346825985579986,2.4323182980210873,2.6289494000279396,2.7819920465008363,3.1550424959247185,3.360519385990158,3.164467636384302,3.2070272508030975,3.369778711402955,3.459754308221302,3.7465885637507435,3.8059428063999263,3.850067611308864,4.049068857301474,3.969732115064953,4.105687751300982,4.176068548062782,4.110553940952155,4.550761997504193,4.550761997504193,4.4919214974812585,4.449957298382227,4.484804029712395,4.789173020949191,5.143104478942172,5.408212229355414,4.838444069955973,5.102830579804232,5.501738287366237,5.649374286172302,5.999576715605417,6.101359409915359,6.489124940924123,6.437831646536572,6.2980697041614135,6.255510089742618,6.725513718988353,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805382E-4,2.1925531043720626E-4,2.1930944626706063E-4,2.1926535805328218E-4,2.1928610891855626E-4,2.1925410152956993E-4,2.1932229259911877E-4,2.1922148009526676E-4,2.1925535677457471E-4,2.194819334272081E-4,2.2122345868647736E-4,2.192557189277262E-4,2.1946336794909433E-4,2.1948623224568887E-4,2.1938652538130795E-4,2.192662217077922E-4,2.1934165776813424E-4,2.1944488069798208E-4,2.1927754147741088E-4,2.1927673977696326E-4,2.194740125378649E-4,2.1929870906764134E-4,2.1929904095723248E-4,2.1943952627086766E-4,2.1927762057634154E-4,2.1948885564790886E-4,2.1933249395190854E-4,2.1925481904056104E-4,2.1935421980567537E-4,2.194211698754805E-4,2.1929978476330206E-4,2.1941723695242723E-4,2.1952496533805905E-4,2.1972871854514247E-4,2.193321149391927E-4,2.1926608871935283E-4,2.1934514652716512E-4,2.1928835723826473E-4,2.1922171407356042E-4,2.1927747357072464E-4,2.1949722707154438E-4,2.1937681902578214E-4,2.1941773696650552E-4,2.1923262471379998E-4,2.1927752932743126E-4,2.192660062669317E-4,2.193402258220398E-4,2.1937825969134989E-4,2.1933365036190113E-4,2.1929888559081117E-4,2.192665484949166E-4,2.197157900444

{"value":"Spoiler warning.<br /><br />When the main character's sister is pushed down the stairs, the killer breaks a glass of vodka next to her, to make it appear that she's been drinking. But right before she is killed, tells her sister's business partner (Teri Garr) on the phone that she hasn't had a drink in 4 days. Yet the police never mention the results of a toxicology report! And, the characters talk about her being drunk when she fell down the stairs. Huh? Really bad mistake in this movie, which is pretty awful, overall. <br /><br />Surprisingly bad, considering the great cast. Some faults: the writing isn't very good, the music is made-for-TV bad, and there is no tension at all because we already know the answer to the mystery from the first scene in the movie.","finished_norm":["spoiler","warningbr","br","when","the","main","charact","sister","be","push","down","the","stair","the","killer","break","a","glass","of","vodka","next","to","her","to","make","it","appear","that","she","be","drink","but","right","befor","she","be","kill","tell","her","sister","busi","partner","teri","garr","on","the","phone","that","she","have","not","have","a","drink","in","dai","yet","the","polic","never","mention","the","result","of","a","toxicologi","report","and","the","charact","talk","about","her","be","drink","when","she","fall","down","the","stair","huh","realli","bad","mistak","in","thi","movi","which","be","pretti","aw","overal","br","br","surprisingli","bad","consid","the","great","cast","some","fault","the","write","be","not","veri","good","the","music","be","madefortv","bad","and","there","be","no","tension","at","all","becaus","we","alreadi","know","the","answer","to","the","mysteri","from","the","scene","in","the","movi"],"filtered":["spoiler","warningbr","br","main","charact","sister","push","stair","killer","break","glass","vodka","next","make","appear","drink","right","befor","kill","tell","sister","busi","partner","teri","garr","phone","drink","dai","yet","polic","never","mention","result","toxicologi","report","charact","talk","drink","fall","stair","huh","realli","bad","mistak","thi","movi","pretti","aw","overal","br","br","surprisingli","bad","consid","great","cast","fault","write","veri","good","music","madefortv","bad","tension","becaus","alreadi","know","answer","mysteri","scene","movi"],"filtered2":["spoiler","warningbr","main","charact","sister","push","stair","killer","break","glass","vodka","next","make","appear","drink","right","befor","kill","tell","sister","busi","partner","teri","garr","phone","drink","dai","yet","polic","never","mention","result","toxicologi","report","charact","talk","drink","fall","stair","huh","realli","bad","mistak","pretti","aw","overal","surprisingli","bad","consid","great","cast","fault","write","veri","good","music","madefortv","bad","tension","becaus","alreadi","know","answer","mysteri","scene"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,9,10,13,15,19,22,26,42,51,65,76,78,79,90,92,118,121,132,138,169,170,179,186,194,252,285,297,317,330,360,403,412,447,471,490,585,592,667,790,800,887,983,990,1256,1298,1398,1514,1777,2141,2645,3692],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,9,10,13,15,19,22,26,42,51,65,76,78,79,90,92,118,121,132,138,169,170,179,186,194,252,285,297,317,330,360,403,412,447,471,490,585,592,667,790,800,887,983,990,1256,1298,1398,1514,1777,2141,2645,3692],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,3.205071257016622,2.247774048205673,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.6219954307453837,1.7139899308309823,1.9073850067444174,2.1337665533324026,2.0064197866819473,1.9469506069506084,2.0477128419653545,2.0489535369135887,2.354379525480895,2.2190595059394194,2.253494045787767,2.2907365189289424,2.4071371113909277,2.4214486257841834,2.507968722980095,2.571852579609833,2.5378812223426954,3.0433232530252132,2.808171552082607,2.813490713560207,2.8529247828056143,2.9292757465539174,3.028335462059722,3.189397019426827,3.107414446935464,3.2070272508030975,3.496027715008137,3.3490645070153917,7.433072437368683,3.5227672760500357,10.995728772890372,3.749984152751882,3.9121030022283168,3.944626193933877,4.165705761027235,4.235066888824737,4.3215761317340196,4.3521595551061,4.429617614145104,4.581533656170946,4.770124825978496,5.039114765418124,5.3064295350454715,11.540004547921834]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875904E-4,2.0127954981638386E-4,2.0132924729208146E-4,2.0128877367343187E-4,2.0130782326822775E-4,2.0127844002166867E-4,2.013410404109268E-4,2.0124849307261728E-4,2.0127959235475908E-4,2.0148759300272522E-4,2.0308633840816423E-4,2.0127992481659617E-4,2.014705496249871E-4,2.014915393803378E-4,2.0140000703507247E-4,2.0128956652077786E-4,2.0135881791649224E-4,2.0145357806076913E-4,2.0129995823319903E-4,2.012992222605794E-4,2.0148032151161302E-4,2.0131939038753904E-4,2.013196950669895E-4,2.0144866261914555E-4,2.0130003084716273E-4,2.0149394770156283E-4,2.0135040540050425E-4,2.012790987071481E-4,2.0137035004885436E-4,2.0143181118237799E-4,2.0132037789173174E-4,2.0142820070206607E-4,2.01527096919992E-4,2.017141453144579E-4,2.0135005746134296E-4,2.0128944443546483E-4,2.0136202064780013E-4,2.0130988725827596E-4,2.0124870786807886E-4,2.0129989589387775E-4,2.0150163278967914E-4,2.0139109646015097E-4,2.0142865972223018E-4,2.0125872399380577E-4,2.0129994707934182E-4,2.0128936874294832E-4,2.0135750336924287E-4,2.013924190120031E-4,2.0135146700162235E-4,2.0131955243836503E-4,2.0128986651608998E-4,2.017022767636138E

{"value":"I tried to finish this film three times, but it's god awful. Case in point: mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast,mom stops for gas, crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby whose running the B&B try to rape her. She escapes, heads to B&B and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops, story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts. Wow.<br /><br />Other action logic deficits abound. Acting is also lukewarm, and the next door neighbor's warning is delivered in a really corny, badly acted moment.<br /><br />Moments of intense gore/death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of

{"value":"Worst mistake of my life.<br /><br />I picked this movie up at Target for $5 because I figured, \"Hey, it's Sandler I can get some cheap laughs\". I was wrong, completely wrong. Mid-way through the film all three of my friends were asleep and I was still suffering. Worst plot, Worst script, Worst movie I have ever seen. I wanted to hit my head up against a wall for an hour, then I'd stop, and you know why? Because it felt damn good. Upon bashing my head in i stuck that damn movie in the microwave and watched it burn....and that felt better than anything else I've ever done. It took American Psycho, Army of Darkness, and Kill Bill just to get over that crap.

{"value":"OK the plot is, wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of optically fogged sex scenes, strung together by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty ladies (Sometimes a combination of the two) Then a demon comes around kills the men, rapes and kills the women, and waxes poetic about the meaning of life. Moronic special effects, bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside, you get what you expect from a film with a title like this.

{"value":"I read all these reviews on here about how this is a such a good movie. Jeez, this movie was predictable and pretty boring. The acting was below average most of the time, especially by Mckenna. I haven't seen a more pathetic attempt at making someone \"badass\" in a movie. Oh man, this movie was a letdown. I also read somewhere this might be a cult classic. I know there are followers of the director, but this movie was just a average piece of film.<br /><br />The script was lame, for the most part the acting was lame, this movie was lame.<br /><br />Oh and pray for the guy that used to be in Cheers.

{"value":"When I borrowed this movie from a friend (thankfully I did not buy it) on the package (which truly looked bad and ugly) was printed \"The ultimate vampire horror\". After watching it I thought that the marketing campaign was probably more expensive than the film itself. The \"story\" begins when a teenager (surprise!) is chased by some vampire/zombie-creatures.<br /><br />Lighting, sound and everything reminded me of my first attempt to make a holiday-video on a ten year old VHS-system if not worse. I gave the movie a 2 out of 10 and only because the promo-T-shirts looked kind of cool. I don't want to dis' film-students or splatter-movies generally but I've seen Braindead and I've seen a 20-dollar-budget movie from students that was ten times better than this

{"value":"This movie was a disappointment. I was looking forward to seeing a good movie. I am the type of person who starts a movie and doesn't turn it off until the end, but I was forcing myself not to turn it off. <br /><br />Theonly reason why I didn't turn it off was because I am a huge Christian Slater fan and I wanted to see him act in it. I was really speechless after I finished watching the movie. <br /><br />This movie was one of the worst movies that I have seen in my life. Thank you Christian Slater for putting some humor into it. If you hadn't been in this movie I would of been bored out of my mind.<br /><br />I also agree that Anthony Hopkins needs to stick to acting. By the time the movie was over I didn't even get the plot.
