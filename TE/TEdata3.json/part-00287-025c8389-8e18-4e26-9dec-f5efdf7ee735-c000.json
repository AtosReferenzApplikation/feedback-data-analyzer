If they are based on real people then I feel very, very sorry for them.<br /><br />The violence (and some of it is very violent) seems quite ostentatious and gratuitous.

{"value":"Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Unfortunately, the witty banter comes off as self-conscious here, and the backstage business is overripe. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress (when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, \"What are ya? Some kind of nut?\"). Otherwise, this scenario is awfully obvious, surprisingly draggy, and not very funny. *1/2 from

{"value":"This movie features a gorgeous brunette named Danielle Petty. She has stunning green eyes, and is in the first few scenes and the last scene. She is the only thing about this movie that is not repulsive. She may not have a future as an actress, because this kind of movie is the kind of offensive disaster that kills careers.<br /><br />The movie itself has absolutely nothing to recommend it. It is not a good horror film, or a good fake journalistic report, or remotely well done. There is no skill apparent in it's production. It is like a bad student film. The story's horrific elements do not make you sick, it is the fact that it is so poorly done that makes you sick.

{"value":"Laughed a lot - because it is so incredibly bad - sorry folks, but definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen... I know it is low budget, but anyway: the actors behave like playing in a soap, the dialogues are absolutely crappy and the last time I have seen such odd pictures was at a trash nite at some youth video festival ten years ago. I really appreciate that people gather together and shoot cheap movies, but at least a certain amount of quality should be accomplished. But at least one good thing: the first three minutes of the movie were quiet interesting and looked okay - and the score was really worth listening to.

{"value":"Only on a very rare occasion does an episode of the x-files fail to generate any excitement or does the episode contain anything which is just totally boring to watch.A detective and his former partner both die in unexplained circumstances.The deaths are linked to the presence of a little girl who was there when the deaths took place.Mulder has devised a theory that a policeman murdered by his colleagues has come back reincarnated as the little girl and is exacting revenge.Now for the bizarre bit.The little girl has no connection at all and seems to just a random person

{"value":"After reading the book, I loved the story. Watching the movie I was disappointed that so many changes were made. It is understandable that books and movies differ but it was two different stories, only the names and some of the book's story remained. Read the book and you'll have a better understanding of the movie. The book gives you a better development of the characters. These characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them. The locations were indeed in line with the book's descriptions. Some characters not included. Television has microwaved so many great books and stories, this is a perfect example of that. Input from the author doesn't always insure a good movie but it can help sometimes.","finished_norm":["after","read","the","book","i","love","the","stori","watch","the","movi","i","be","disappoint","that","so","mani","chang","be","make","it","be","understand","that","book","and","movi","differ","but","it","be","two","differ","stori","onli","the","name","and","some","of","the","book","stori","remain","read","the","book","and","you","will","have","a","well","understand","of","the","movi","the","book","give","you","a","well","develop","of","the","charact","thi","charact","be","extrem","interest","and","make","you","care","about","them","the","locat","be","ind","in","line","with","the","book","descript","some","charact","not","includ","televis","have","microwav","so","mani","great","book","and","stori","thi","be","a","perfect","exampl","of","that","input","from","the","author","doe","not","alwai","insur","a","good","movi","but","it","can","help","sometim"],"filtered":["read","book","love","stori","watch","movi","disappoint","mani","chang","make","understand","book","movi","differ","two","differ","stori","onli","name","book","stori","remain","read","book","well","understand","movi","book","give","well","develop","charact","thi","charact","extrem","interest","make","care","locat","ind","line","book","descript","charact","includ","televis","microwav","mani","great","book","stori","thi","perfect","exampl","input","author","doe","alwai","insur","good","movi","help","sometim"],"filtered2":["read","book","love","stori","watch","disappoint","mani","chang","make","understand","book","differ","two","differ","stori","onli","name","book","stori","remain","read","book","well","understand","book","give","well","develop","charact","charact","extrem","interest","make","care","locat","ind","line","book","descript","charact","includ","televis","microwav","mani","great","book","stori","perfect","exampl","input","author","doe","alwai","insur","good","help","sometim"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,10,11,17,18,20,30,47,50,51,54,60,107,143,145,151,185,187,197,204,205,212,278,301,307,320,329,500,663,677,682,775,829,1111,2070,4107,8424,8481],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,10,11,17,18,20,30,47,50,51,54,60,107,143,145,151,185,187,197,204,205,212,278,301,307,320,329,500,663,677,682,775,829,1111,2070,4107,8424,8481],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,3.3716610723085094,0.9913098153388195,5.108214776042387,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,1.3364419891718522,1.7064694353107215,3.43598877114071,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,2.1439533986393955,2.3409902041158843,4.69198042906518,19.601718407671303,2.518833027372001,2.4732161909892554,2.558331832813986,5.249049228095168,2.571852579609833,5.196758667886523,2.8336934208777267,2.8309760279012264,2.8767855639325206,2.938298364153555,2.951986790814132,3.3814747511661465,3.7297814454343623,3.6559115968679063,3.6497387377608255,3.753391311073496,3.8240921249056035,4.2574141875167335,4.944927550358424,5.967828017290836,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612978E-4,2.116930065387443E-4,2.117452751773487E-4,2.117027076039154E-4,2.1172274275403055E-4,2.116918393273703E-4,2.11757678428385E-4,2.1166034303434332E-4,2.1169305127789712E-4,2.11911813107254E-4,2.1359327166514585E-4,2.116934009400755E-4,2.1189388796841974E-4,2.119159636557946E-4,2.1181969576676945E-4,2.117035414702399E-4,2.1177637567609513E-4,2.1187603835847056E-4,2.1171447081128584E-4,2.1171369676217493E-4,2.1190416541618472E-4,2.1173490831315583E-4,2.1173522875559002E-4,2.1187086861014436E-4,2.1171454718202647E-4,2.119184965746197E-4,2.1176752792775866E-4,2.1169253209079127E-4,2.1178850443817637E-4,2.1185314534259396E-4,2.1173594690714967E-4,2.1184934806943345E-4,2.1195336081055466E-4,2.1215008639459363E-4,2.117671619875168E-4,2.1170341306868596E-4,2.117797441048318E-4,2.1172491352726197E-4,2.1166056894252475E-4,2.117144052467595E-4,2.1192657926066675E-4,2.118103241917791E-4,2.118498308375969E-4,2.1167110326541515E-4,2.1171445908036945E-4,2.117033334601196E-4,2.117749931190509E-4,2.1181171516755455E-4,2.1176864445217778E-4,2.1173507874789E-4,2.117038569861958E-4,2.1213760380898701E-4,2.117571277748941E-4,2.1171441055568423E-4,2.1175599373704447E-4,2.1169274868102945E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.117257762850265E-4,2.1170415419131475E-4,2.1169262784140997E-4,2.118619870217944E-4,2.1177694030929714E-4,2.1169253934833312E-4,2.1167101702582124E-4,2.1164973116690372E-4,2.1184109602769688E-4,2.1170291001284915E-4,2.1179914228165446E-4,2.1186129996057562E-4,2.117651826114985E-4,2.117146909644076E-4,2.1167129451241952E-4,2.11725443940454E-4,2.1167118050363867E-4,2.116822886648672E-4,2.1167130050324474E-4,2.1180870475627508E-4,2.117456637074074E-4,2.116928219033841E-4,2.117133283218024E-4]}}
{"value":"I am never a big fan of Taiwan movie production as opposed to Korean, Hongkong or even China. Strong acting quality is hardly found in them as clearly shown in this film. I don't consider myself as hard-to-please audience as I am, in fact, a fan of indie movies. However this movie shows weak plot and slow pace. I found myself lost in the middle as to where the plot is going. The acting certainly does not make it better. Rainie's acting is sub par as she 'over-act', trying to be perky and cute. Although I have to admit she is a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong on the other hand plays a more suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved character. Overall I find this movie is a disappointment.","finished_norm":["i","be","never","a","big","fan","of","taiwan","movi","product","a","oppos","to","korean","hongkong","or","even","china","strong","act","qualiti","be","hardli","find","in","them","a","clearli","show","in","thi","film","i","do","not","consid","myself","a","hardtopleas","audienc","a","i","be","in","fact","a","fan","of","indi","movi","howev","thi","movi","show","weak","plot","and","slow","pace","i","find","myself","lose","in","the","middl","a","to","where","the","plot","be","go","the","act","certainli","doe","not","make","it","well","raini","act","be","sub","par","a","she","overact","try","to","be","perki","and","cute","although","i","have","to","admit","she","be","a","pleasur","to","look","at","isabella","leong","on","the","other","hand","plai","a","much","suitabl","role","a","a","confus","sad","regret","extrem","reserv","charact","overal","i","find","thi","movi","be","a","disappoint"],"filtered":["never","big","fan","taiwan","movi","product","oppos","korean","hongkong","even","china","strong","act","qualiti","hardli","find","clearli","show","thi","film","consid","hardtopleas","audienc","fact","fan","indi","movi","howev","thi","movi","show","weak","plot","slow","pace","find","lose","middl","plot","go","act","certainli","doe","make","well","raini","act","sub","par","overact","try","perki","cute","although","admit","pleasur","look","isabella","leong","hand","plai","much","suitabl","role","confus","sad","regret","extrem","reserv","charact","overal","find","thi","movi","disappoint"],"filtered2":["never","big","fan","taiwan","product","oppos","korean","hongkong","even","china","strong","act","qualiti","hardli","find","clearli","show","consid","hardtopleas","audienc","fact","fan","indi","howev","show","weak","plot","slow","pace","find","lose","middl","plot","go","act","certainli","doe","make","well","raini","act","sub","par","overact","try","perki","cute","although","admit","pleasur","look","isabella","leong","hand","plai","suitabl","role","confus","sad","regret","extrem","reserv","charact","overal","find","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,10,16,18,20,21,28,32,36,38,40,42,82,97,113,128,140,168,187,190,221,235,237,317,319,329,379,389,390,412,427,455,494,546,554,631,665,691,855,1415,1638,1678,2074,2135,2356,2404,2767,2882,2905,4245,4335,8102],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,10,16,18,20,21,28,32,36,38,40,42,82,97,113,128,140,168,187,190,221,235,237,317,319,329,379,389,390,412,427,455,494,546,554,631,665,691,855,1415,1638,1678,2074,2135,2356,2404,2767,2882,2905,4245,4335,8102],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,3.4860466360051467,3.0904588387038183,2.742262257014735,1.4680183469605717,4.557934924044366,1.6284968758320737,1.6219954307453837,2.020196584395323,2.0545557924622586,2.1521782565202803,2.3409902041158843,4.634339551994196,2.4894767118610357,2.4732161909892554,2.558331832813986,2.6423424573643777,2.6457189377809835,2.640097787510554,2.8529247828056143,2.9056060024680126,2.951986790814132,3.1272886331425473,3.0914425013694116,3.132778125427319,3.107414446935464,3.233054746047873,3.2787058260741455,3.3243163373261977,3.4572130107926293,3.439602492783994,3.607563812710113,3.5929222627171646,3.5929222627171646,3.9201351739255808,4.4919214974812585,4.589376833631972,4.679973728984199,5.064116067623542,4.956227105612356,5.129498826886393,5.521540914662417,5.290429193699031,5.501738287366237,5.373120909544144,5.9370563586240825,5.9370563586240825,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.98208034250792E-4,1.9803239209117198E-4,1.9808128781854354E-4,1.98041467143641E-4,1.9806020941939248E-4,1.9803130020030487E-4,1.9809289068399753E-4,1.980018363726985E-4,1.980324339432936E-4,1.982370790049048E-4,1.998100325278666E-4,1.980327610416647E-4,1.9822031058076102E-4,1.9824096171727884E-4,1.9815090602457114E-4,1.9804224720031658E-4,1.9811038139259533E-4,1.9820361281160028E-4,1.9805247126764263E-4,1.980517471681576E-4,1.9822992482167886E-4,1.980715899312672E-4,1.9807188969545313E-4,1.9819877666871446E-4,1.9805254271015602E-4,1.982433311860776E-4,1.9810210459216465E-4,1.9803194825949045E-4,1.981217274819505E-4,1.9818219708903884E-4,1.98072561504473E-4,1.981786448550766E-4,1.9827594562220623E-4,1.9845997644414855E-4,1.9810176226615848E-4,1.980421270845542E-4,1.9811353245559554E-4,1.9806224011196345E-4,1.9800204770295586E-4,1.9805240993401525E-4,1.9825089229392236E-4,1.9814213920018076E-4,1.981790964700628E-4,1.9801190224276878E-4,1.980524602937259E-4,1.9804205261315298E-4,1.9810908805237995E-4,1.9814344041586406E-4,1.9810314906692155E-4,1.9807174936779584E-4,1.9804254235593138E-4,1.9844829936360828E

{"value":"An obvious b-grade effort to cash in on the Hostel/Saw buzz, my expectations for this film were low (really low!) and yet it still managed to disappoint on every level. The acting is so bad it's not even funny, the plot-line is non-existent and the only scare was realizing that I had wasted 1hour 21 minutes watching it! I'm surprised to note that 34 people gave it a 10 star rating. I can only suspect that 33 of these are Cast and Crew. The 34th is possibly the directors mother? - although I'm sure even she would find it hard to go higher than a 2! DVD extras include an hour long \"making of\" feature. Which raises the question, \"Why?\" (although perhaps it serves to demonstrate what not to do!).

{"value":"I, too, was fooled by the packaging. I, too, fell for the gory packaging and the DVD casing that claims \"grieved fans as every copy was pulled from shelves\". Though it was inexpensive ($6.99), it wasn't really all that worth it - no scares, and very limited gore. The ending was very cheesy and didn't deliver the punch it should have. I really don't even know how it became a \"Video Nasty\" with how very tame it is. The story drags, the characters are obvious amateur actors...it doesn't live up to the promise. The DVD bonus feature (the \"interview\")is very strange as the director appears very incoherent and not all there. The lead actress talks like she's appearing in a Shakespearean production.

{"value":"Little Mosque is one of the most boring CBC comedies I have ever seen. They have a way of producing the easiest comedy programming they can for the oldest most-easily-offended viewers which for CBC means 85 year old farmers in Saskatchewan. The jokes are all predictable and so deathly lame I can't believe it. The performances are very hammy and over acted but I don't blame the actors since those kind of one dimensional stereotyped characters are probably exactly what the CBC asked for and demanded. Very lame show with bad jokes they tried to present as \"controversial\" well it is less controversial than the other boring CBC comedies like The Hour Has 22 Minutes, Royal Canadian Air Farce and Rick Mercer's Report.","finished_norm":["littl","mosqu","be","on","of","the","much","bore","cbc","comedi","i","have","ever","see","thei","have","a","wai","of","produc","the","easi","comedi","programm","thei","can","for","the","old","mosteasilyoffend","viewer","which","for","cbc","mean","year","old","farmer","in","saskatchewan","the","joke","be","all","predict","and","so","deathli","lame","i","ca","not","believ","it","the","perform","be","veri","hammi","and","over","act","but","i","do","not","blame","the","actor","sinc","that","kind","of","on","dimension","stereotyp","charact","be","probabl","exactli","what","the","cbc","ask","for","and","demand","veri","lame","show","with","bad","joke","thei","try","to","present","a","controversi","good","it","be","littl","controversi","than","the","other","bore","cbc","comedi","like","the","hour","have","minut","royal","canadian","air","farc","and","rick","mercer","report"],"filtered":["littl","mosqu","much","bore","cbc","comedi","ever","see","thei","wai","produc","easi","comedi","programm","thei","old","mosteasilyoffend","viewer","cbc","mean","year","old","farmer","saskatchewan","joke","predict","deathli","lame","ca","believ","perform","veri","hammi","act","blame","actor","sinc","kind","dimension","stereotyp","charact","probabl","exactli","cbc","ask","demand","veri","lame","show","bad","joke","thei","try","present","controversi","good","littl","controversi","bore","cbc","comedi","like","hour","minut","royal","canadian","air","farc","rick","mercer","report"],"filtered2":["littl","mosqu","bore","cbc","comedi","ever","see","wai","produc","easi","comedi","programm","old","mosteasilyoffend","viewer","cbc","mean","year","old","farmer","saskatchewan","joke","predict","deathli","lame","ca","believ","perform","veri","hammi","act","blame","actor","sinc","kind","dimension","stereotyp","charact","probabl","exactli","cbc","ask","demand","veri","lame","show","bad","joke","try","present","controversi","good","littl","controversi","bore","cbc","comedi","like","hour","minut","royal","canadian","air","farc","rick","mercer","report"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,9,10,14,15,21,28,33,36,41,44,57,59,67,81,88,91,105,108,122,127,148,162,174,214,261,279,306,337,373,411,462,604,679,744,898,990,1683,1884,2256,2374,2603,2641,2686,3323,3474,3478,4917],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,9,10,14,15,21,28,33,36,41,44,57,59,67,81,88,91,105,108,122,127,148,162,174,214,261,279,306,337,373,411,462,604,679,744,898,990,1683,1884,2256,2374,2603,2641,2686,3323,3474,3478,4917],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,2.2350163994518417,2.4001215597131385,1.162015545335049,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.834162586674748,1.8693254449200722,3.9141830778533158,1.949757232424728,2.0317223413467334,2.0105926690411424,2.1765612129984904,4.277015007255866,2.2489347673732487,7.30790381132591,2.3018654096236517,2.3586007221245198,2.456282578459816,5.460751613699401,2.7085302779237206,2.7910771187233068,2.8739486825973213,2.973659465713028,6.141071633100196,3.229006157521873,3.2639531875991072,3.5727776966246974,3.6715125373103863,3.700222643192818,3.892300374932137,4.235066888824737,4.662879295624898,5.156897801074508,10.370137356082408,5.259176650194926,5.214056214914456,5.3064295350454715,5.541743621979936,5.583416318380505,5.967828017290836,5.695894301807195,27.178026361901217]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.950611946162389E-4,1.9488834103030856E-4,1.9493646046718594E-4,1.9489727200317503E-4,1.9491571671815204E-4,1.9488726647479048E-4,1.949478791203449E-4,1.948582704281237E-4,1.9488838221796712E-4,1.9508977824281081E-4,1.966377588502797E-4,1.9488870412317778E-4,1.9507327604168824E-4,1.950935993115021E-4,1.9500497338335564E-4,1.9489803967532102E-4,1.949650921386096E-4,1.950568433737985E-4,1.9490810142076942E-4,1.9490738881741248E-4,1.9508273764260595E-4,1.9492691654791685E-4,1.9492721155291214E-4,1.9505208401168582E-4,1.9490817172902942E-4,1.9509593116155165E-4,1.9495694674437415E-4,1.948879042450978E-4,1.949762580923622E-4,1.9503576765685194E-4,1.9492787269599076E-4,1.95032271819749E-4,1.9512802779626692E-4,1.9530913686235482E-4,1.9495660985328916E-4,1.9489792146657034E-4,1.949681931739206E-4,1.9491771517053712E-4,1.9485847840320714E-4,1.949080410609022E-4,1.951033722258576E-4,1.9499634574500062E-4,1.9503271626469319E-4,1.9486817648792687E-4,1.949080906210795E-4,1.9489784817751049E-4,1.9496381933204346E-4,1.949976263020002E-4,1.9495797463658145E-4,1.9492707345315966E-4,1.9489833014491292E-4,1.952976451723816E-4,1.9494737217896278E-4,1.9490804594839256E-4,1.9494632816358033E-4,1.9488810364191725E-4,0.9845966403807115,1.949185094406559E-4,1.9489860375

{"value":"I read John Everingham's story years ago in Reader's Digest, and I remember thinking what a great movie it would make. And it probably would have been had Michael Landon never got his hands on it.

The acting, for lack of a better word, is atrocious, the screenplay sloppy, and there are more close-ups of Landon's puss than should be allowed.<br /><br />This movie reflects Everingham's story as much as \"Little House On The Prairie\" reflects the books is was \"based\" on. It's just another vehicle to show off Landons horrendous hair.","finished_norm":["i","read","john","everingham","stori","year","ago","in","reader","digest","and","i","rememb","think","what","a","great","movi","it","would","make","and","it","probabl","would","have","be","have","michael","landon","never","get","hi","hand","on","it","a","far","a","i","be","concern","landon","be","on","of","the","wrong","actor","on","earth","and","hi","artist","licens","go","wai","over","the","top","similar","to","hi","massacr","of","the","littl","hous","book","seri","be","proof","the","act","for","lack","of","a","well","word","be","atroci","the","screenplai","sloppi","and","there","be","much","closeup","of","landon","puss","than","should","be","allowedbr","br","thi","movi","reflect","everingham","stori","a","much","a","littl","hous","on","the","prairi","reflect","the","book","be","be","base","on","it","just","anoth","vehicl","to","show","off","landon","horrend","hair"],"filtered":["read","john","everingham","stori","year","ago","reader","digest","rememb","think","great","movi","make","probabl","michael","landon","never","get","hi","hand","far","concern","landon","wrong","actor","earth","hi","artist","licens","go","wai","top","similar","hi","massacr","littl","hous","book","seri","proof","act","lack","well","word","atroci","screenplai","sloppi","much","closeup","landon","puss","allowedbr","br","thi","movi","reflect","everingham","stori","much","littl","hous","prairi","reflect","book","base","anoth","vehicl","show","landon","horrend","hair"],"filtered2":["read","john","everingham","stori","year","ago","reader","digest","rememb","think","great","make","probabl","michael","landon","never","get","hand","far","concern","landon","wrong","actor","earth","artist","licens","go","wai","top","similar","massacr","littl","hous","book","proof","act","lack","well","word","atroci","screenplai","sloppi","closeup","landon","puss","allowedbr","reflect","everingham","stori","littl","hous","prairi","reflect","book","base","anoth","vehicl","show","landon","horrend","hair"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,12,14,17,20,21,25,28,33,41,42,51,57,73,101,145,148,151,183,213,235,258,290,291,334,364,466,522,589,610,703,724,813,874,1219,1423,1681,1842,1948,1982,2006,2158,2886,4923,5352,6983],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,12,14,17,20,21,25,28,33,41,42,51,57,73,101,145,148,151,183,213,235,258,290,291,334,364,466,522,589,610,703,724,813,874,1219,1423,1681,1842,1948,1982,2006,2158,2886,4923,5352,6983],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,2.2350163994518417,2.5541073880211935,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.7139899308309823,1.834162586674748,1.8950689206770979,2.098582041218749,2.34599021453259,2.3018654096236517,5.6004909736203725,2.4885128563647294,5.6865257437877545,2.6457189377809835,2.7061321952397077,2.8612813773965557,3.016831637578237,2.942840385588056,2.9878441007049847,3.4446025032006995,3.604618302480356,3.530930586689197,3.477726550625732,3.6746621462132825,3.7987743169213135,3.8204358137024927,3.872882289075035,4.246178114249808,4.470719289830655,4.662879295624898,9.656787468204943,4.911775343041523,4.956227105612356,4.956227105612356,5.1994574154933035,5.408212229355414,6.137727054086234,6.214688095222362,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255743E-4,2.2737792632708303E-4,2.2743406769354634E-4,2.273883461709779E-4,2.2740986578072465E-4,2.2737667263379317E-4,2.274473899357236E-4,2.273428426933877E-4,2.2737797438108332E-4,2.2761294487884314E-4,2.2941898734736655E-4,2.2737834995069866E-4,2.275936916169433E-4,2.2761740295299362E-4,2.2751400231007051E-4,2.2738924182076243E-4,2.2746747251417942E-4,2.2757451948007232E-4,2.274009809468856E-4,2.2740014954633728E-4,2.27604730549211E-4,2.274229327197405E-4,2.2742327690464004E-4,2.2756896669080796E-4,2.2740106297614542E-4,2.2762012354277323E-4,2.2745796921172124E-4,2.273774167259702E-4,2.2748049992975648E-4,2.2754993025739318E-4,2.2742404826603307E-4,2.2754585163377186E-4,2.276575709662828E-4,2.2786887249242027E-4,2.2745757615795574E-4,2.2738910390558258E-4,2.2747109051910854E-4,2.274121973925429E-4,2.2734308533973048E-4,2.2740091052450234E-4,2.2762880509736297E-4,2.2750393636919433E-4,2.2754637017156248E-4,2.2735440017971148E-4,2.274009683467932E-4,2.273890183985976E-4,2.2746598751966358E-4,2.2750543040620842E-4,2.2745916846251968E-4,2.2742311578245503E-4,2.2738958071416736E-4,2.278554650375551E-4,2.2744679848279406E-4,2.2740091622677996E-4,2.2744558042094666E-4,2.2737764936397762E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441414E-4,2.2738989994003475E-4,2.2737751957101681E-4,2.2755942704103622E-4,2.274680789826155E-4,2.2737742452124337E-4,2.27354307550387

{"value":"Eric Rohmer's 'The Lady and the Duke' is based on the journals of an English aristocrat who lived through the French revolution. But it's a stilted affair, with its strange, painted backdrops and mannered conversational tone. Most notably, this portrait of age of terror takes place almost entirely at one remove from the real action; one sees very little of ordinary people in this movie, and little of the chaos, poverty and terror that unfolded away from the drawing rooms of the persecuted, but spoilt, aristocratic classes. The result is frequently dull, and ultimately unenlightening about the forces that sometimes drive societies to the brink of destruction; it's a disappointing film from an acclaimed director.","finished_norm":["eric","rohmer","the","ladi","and","the","duke","be","base","on","the","journal","of","a","english","aristocrat","who","live","through","the","french","revolut","but","it","a","stilt","affair","with","it","strang","paint","backdrop","and","manner","convers","tone","much","notabl","thi","portrait","of","ag","of","terror","take","place","almost","entir","at","on","remov","from","the","real","action","on","see","veri","littl","of","ordinari","peopl","in","thi","movi","and","littl","of","the","chao","poverti","and","terror","that","unfold","awai","from","the","draw","room","of","the","persecut","but","spoil","aristocrat","class","the","result","be","frequent","dull","and","ultim","unenlighten","about","the","forc","that","sometim","drive","societi","to","the","brink","of","destruct","it","a","disappoint","film","from","a","acclaim","director"],"filtered":["eric","rohmer","ladi","duke","base","journal","english","aristocrat","live","french","revolut","stilt","affair","strang","paint","backdrop","manner","convers","tone","much","notabl","thi","portrait","ag","terror","take","place","almost","entir","remov","real","action","see","veri","littl","ordinari","peopl","thi","movi","littl","chao","poverti","terror","unfold","awai","draw","room","persecut","spoil","aristocrat","class","result","frequent","dull","ultim","unenlighten","forc","sometim","drive","societi","brink","destruct","disappoint","film","acclaim","director"],"filtered2":["eric","rohmer","ladi","duke","base","journal","english","aristocrat","live","french","revolut","stilt","affair","strang","paint","backdrop","manner","convers","tone","notabl","portrait","ag","terror","take","place","almost","entir","remov","real","action","see","veri","littl","ordinari","peopl","littl","chao","poverti","terror","unfold","awai","draw","room","persecut","spoil","aristocrat","class","result","frequent","dull","ultim","unenlighten","forc","sometim","drive","societi","brink","destruct","disappoint","acclaim","director"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,14,15,23,31,58,80,116,129,131,155,164,187,198,334,338,367,417,442,447,461,472,500,513,576,588,628,735,868,899,967,1046,1049,1193,1201,1304,1448,1527,1722,1763,1764,1957,1991,2472,2582,2700,2709,3001,3309,3338,3739,4133,4682,4961,5662,6254,7476],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,14,15,23,31,58,80,116,129,131,155,164,187,198,334,338,367,417,442,447,461,472,500,513,576,588,628,735,868,899,967,1046,1049,1193,1201,1304,1448,1527,1722,1763,1764,1957,1991,2472,2582,2700,2709,3001,3309,3338,3739,4133,4682,4961,5662,6254,7476],"values":[0.6557002054693947,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,1.364847727375781,1.4070669811451506,1.865701314626681,1.9951803900462557,2.2466628996789315,2.4106958340079214,2.2512118082053005,2.3074766467914385,2.3930275298746078,2.4732161909892554,2.5439726117360975,2.942840385588056,2.9720957437368454,3.0791938792932125,3.1932880749197934,3.257696649984802,3.2070272508030975,3.358217889001879,3.4222967456864013,3.3814747511661465,3.454678155189441,3.587125145032839,3.6375061693251913,3.607563812710113,3.7132521434831514,3.944626193933877,4.197121957260614,4.110553940952155,4.067587905068712,4.176068548062782,4.240607069200353,4.315570107673808,4.456830177669989,9.132058939269962,4.5432147918688095,4.724033718778229,4.74221603786142,5.3560264761848435,4.911775343041523,5.089758498236879,5.463272006538442,5.274680836730892,5.243909178064138,5.373120909544144,5.444579873526289,5.626901430320244,5.583416318380505,5.7959777603641776,5.878215858601149,6.794506590475304,6.2980697041614135,13.086384324388797,6.437831646536572,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875923E-4,2.0127954981638403E-4,2.0132924729208162E-4,2.0128877367343206E-4,2.013078232682279E-4,2.0127844002166883E-4,2.0134104041092697E-4,2.0124849307261744E-4,2.0127959235475925E-4,2.0148759300272538E-4,2.030863385289622E-4,2.0127992481659633E-4,2.0147054962498727E-4,2.0149153938033796E-4,2.0140000703507263E-4,2.0128956652077805E-4,2.013588179164924E-4,2.014535780607693E-4,2.012999582331992E-4,2.0129922226057957E-4,2.0148032151161318E-4,2.013193903875392E-4,2.0131969506698966E-4,2.014486626191457E-4,2.013000308471629E-4,2.01493947701563E-4,2.0135040540050441E-4,2.0127909870714826E-4,2.0137035004885452E-4,2.0143181118237815E-4,2.013203778917319E-4,2.0142820070206624E-4,2.0152709691999217E-4,2.0171414531445806E-4,2.0135005746134313E-4,2.01289444435465E-4,2.013620206478003E-4,2.0130988725827612E-4,2.0124870786807902E-4,2.012998958938779E-4,2.015016327896793E-4,2.0139109646015113E-4,2.0142865972223035E-4,2.0125872399380594E-4,2.0129994707934198E-4,2.0128936874294848E-4,2.0135750336924303E-4,2.0139241901200326E-4,2.013514670016225

{"value":"\"Meatball Machine\" has got to be one of the most complex ridiculous, awful and over-exaggerated sci-fi horror films that I have ever came across. It is about good against evil and a coming-of-age tale, with the aim of to entertain with bloody, sleazy and humorous context. Because of that the violence isn't particularly gruesome and it doesn't make you squirm, but the gratuitous bloodletting and nudity does run freely. The performances by Issei Takahashi and Toru Tezuka is the worst i have seen, if that was not enough it is also directed by an unheard of director called Yudai Yamaguchi. This movie just have it all, it is bad to the bone!, A must see for every b-movie freak!!!...

{"value":"I wanted to punch the TV. Watching it was torture. I hated it. Never watch this movie. The terrorists are annoying. Adam Sandler is annoying. I normally like him but not in this one. I wanted to break the DVD. This is the most irritating film in the world. The comedian he's jealous of is obnoxious. The only remotely funny part is the rocker with the black teeth getting all the girls. It was so irritating I wanted to punch the TV. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO ANNOY SOMEONE. If you even like Adam Sandler a little bit, Don't buy it. It will just make you hate him. Do yourself a favor, if you see it in the store, hide it to put everyone out of danger of buying it. Its a waste of the $1.99 I paid for it.","finished_norm":["i","want","to","punch","the","tv","watch","it","be","tortur","i","hate","it","never","watch","thi","movi","the","terrorist","be","annoi","adam","sandler","be","annoi","i","normal","like","him","but","not","in","thi","on","i","want","to","break","the","dvd","thi","be","the","much","irrit","film","in","the","world","the","comedian","he","jealou","of","be","obnoxi","the","onli","remot","funni","part","be","the","rocker","with","the","black","tooth","get","all","the","girl","it","be","so","irrit","i","want","to","punch","the","tv","do","not","bui","thi","movi","unless","you","want","to","annoi","someon","if","you","even","like","adam","sandler","a","littl","bite","do","not","bui","it","it","will","just","make","you","hate","him","do","yourself","a","favor","if","you","see","it","in","the","store","hide","it","to","put","everyon","out","of","danger","of","bui","it","it","a","wast","of","the","i","pai","for","it"],"filtered":["want","punch","tv","watch","tortur","hate","never","watch","thi","movi","terrorist","annoi","adam","sandler","annoi","normal","like","thi","want","break","dvd","thi","much","irrit","film","world","comedian","jealou","obnoxi","onli","remot","funni","part","rocker","black","tooth","get","girl","irrit","want","punch","tv","bui","thi","movi","unless","want","annoi","someon","even","like","adam","sandler","littl","bite","bui","make","hate","favor","see","store","hide","put","everyon","danger","bui","wast","pai"],"filtered2":["want","punch","tv","watch","tortur","hate","never","watch","terrorist","annoi","adam","sandler","annoi","normal","like","want","break","dvd","irrit","world","comedian","jealou","obnoxi","onli","remot","funni","part","rocker","black","tooth","get","girl","irrit","want","punch","tv","bui","unless","want","annoi","someon","even","like","adam","sandler","littl","bite","bui","make","hate","favor","see","store","hide","put","everyon","danger","bui","wast","pai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,7,11,14,37,42,61,62,84,89,139,154,159,165,172,229,246,247,271,322,339,347,360,460,700,707,793,802,883,958,978,1110,1212,1248,1518,1542,1633,1812,2708,3742,7354],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,7,11,14,37,42,61,62,84,89,139,154,159,165,172,229,246,247,271,322,339,347,360,460,700,707,793,802,883,958,978,1110,1212,1248,1518,1542,1633,1812,2708,3742,7354],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,5.950617285909722,1.6219954307453837,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,2.2212694515902225,1.9940046109572438,2.2939035841256437,2.348499626138016,2.300267965194495,2.448847599972298,5.000281788719697,2.8432628718938773,2.673149229007135,2.7303758068497004,8.273222095367146,2.885344817328191,6.007688884102852,9.045596952463054,3.028335462059722,3.216957819005698,3.616452760127359,3.6375061693251913,3.770603439954617,3.8883864756110005,3.8614098879127985,7.939464230129906,4.058285512406398,4.1554492608600455,4.550761997504193,9.275546748987644,4.573751515728891,9.19456402627817,4.828393734102471,5.014723312293965,11.756431717202299,5.7446844659766265,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875923E-4,2.0127954981638405E-4,2.0132924729208165E-4,2.0128877367343206E-4,2.0130782326822794E-4,2.0127844002166886E-4,2.01341040410927E-4,2.0124849307261747E-4,2.0127959235475927E-4,2.014875930027254E-4,2.0308633840816437E-4,2.0127992481659636E-4,2.014705496249873E-4,2.01491539380338E-4,2.0140000703507265E-4,2.0128956652077805E-4,2.0135881791649243E-4,2.0145357806076932E-4,2.0129995823319922E-4,2.012992222605796E-4,2.014803215116132E-4,2.0131939038753923E-4,2.0131969506698968E-4,2.0144866261914574E-4,2.0130003084716292E-4,2.0149394770156302E-4,2.0135040540050444E-4,2.0127909870714829E-4,2.0137035004885455E-4,2.0143181118237818E-4,2.0132037789173193E-4,2.0142820070206626E-4,2.015270969199922E-4,2.0171414531445809E-4,2.0135005746134315E-4,2.0128944443546502E-4,2.0136202064780032E-4,2.0130988725827615E-4,2.0124870786807905E-4,2.0129989589387793E-4,2.0150163278967933E-4,2.0139109646015116E-4,2.0142865972223037E-4,2.0125872399380596E-4,2.01299947079342E-4,2.012893687429485E-4,2.0135750336924306E-4,2.013924190120033E-4,2.0135146700162254E-4,2.0131955243836522E-4,2.0128986651609017E-4,2.0170227676361398E-4,2.0134051684480376E-4,2.012999009416497E-4,2.0133943859176377E-4,2.012793046430285E-4,0.9840914994019674,2.0131070757585436E-4,2.012901491012994E-4,2.0127918974766843E-4,2.014402179277789E-4,2.0135935477464645E-4,2.012791056076821E-4,2.0125864199645082E-4,2.0123840321685944E-4,2.01420354589089E-4,2.0128896612560483E-4,2.0138046460285562E-4,2.0143956466400287E-4,2.0134817545342806E-4,2.0130016755670008E-4,2.012589

{"value":"Geez! This is one of those movies that you think you previously reviewed but you didn't. I mean, you didn't give a crap about it but somehow it came to your mind.<br /><br />To be honest and brief; this is one of the worst, boring, and stupid slashers ever made. I can't say anything good about this piece of crap because there are barely decent sequences that could tell it's made by professional film makers.<br /><br />The death scenes are horrible, bloodless, stupid. The plot is somehow good taking in account that it copied \"Popcorn\" from 1991.<br /><br />To make things even worse, this isn't a movie so bad that it's good. It's just plain bad.<br /><br />Molly Ringwald tried to do her best but it wasn't

{"value":"***Possible Spoilers***<br /><br />When I saw this today I had some expectation of how it would be like, not too high, but not low either. This was nothing like I expected at all though, it seems to me like the movie makers couldn't make up their mind of what kind of movie to make.<br /><br />In the begining of the film it's somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting, but that'll soon change to some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes... As I watched further I almost fell asleep a couple of times.<br /><br />The ending is the most ridiculous of all though, almost splatter/comedy...<br /><br />I'm not saying it doesn't have some good

{"value":"LIVE A LITTLE, LOVE A LITTLE is one of Elvis' weirdest movies. Part slapstick, part fluff, part surreal and part strange. Elvis meets up with a very off-beat girl with an annoying voice. She looks like Jennifer Aniston. Story doesn't make much sense as is the case with most Elvis Presley movies, and there a bunch of odd characters galore. Not much music in this one, but what there is I liked, although none are memorable. Strange continuity. Elvis and Michelle Carey go into her beach house at night, but a few minutes later a delivery boy comes in and it's stark daylight!! What?? That's about the essence of the movie. What?? Oh, two good things about the movie: A) Elvis looks great and B) the dog steals the show.","finished_norm":["live","a","littl","love","a","littl","be","on","of","elvi","weird","movi","part","slapstick","part","fluff","part","surreal","and","part","strang","elvi","meet","up","with","a","veri","offbeat","girl","with","a","annoi","voic","she","look","like","jennif","aniston","stori","doe","not","make","much","sens","a","be","the","case","with","much","elvi","preslei","movi","and","there","a","bunch","of","odd","charact","galor","not","much","music","in","thi","on","but","what","there","be","i","like","although","none","be","memor","strang","continu","elvi","and","michel","carei","go","into","her","beach","hous","at","night","but","a","few","minut","late","a","deliveri","boi","come","in","and","it","stark","daylight","what","that","about","the","essenc","of","the","movi","what","oh","two","good","thing","about","the","movi","a","elvi","look","great","and","b","the","dog","steal","the","show"],"filtered":["live","littl","love","littl","elvi","weird","movi","part","slapstick","part","fluff","part","surreal","part","strang","elvi","meet","veri","offbeat","girl","annoi","voic","look","like","jennif","aniston","stori","doe","make","much","sens","case","much","elvi","preslei","movi","bunch","odd","charact","galor","much","music","thi","like","although","none","memor","strang","continu","elvi","michel","carei","go","beach","hous","night","minut","late","deliveri","boi","come","stark","daylight","essenc","movi","oh","two","good","thing","movi","elvi","look","great","b","dog","steal","show"],"filtered2":["live","littl","love","littl","elvi","weird","part","slapstick","part","fluff","part","surreal","part","strang","elvi","meet","veri","offbeat","girl","annoi","voic","look","like","jennif","aniston","stori","doe","make","sens","case","elvi","preslei","bunch","odd","charact","galor","music","like","although","none","memor","strang","continu","elvi","michel","carei","go","beach","hous","night","minut","late","deliveri","boi","come","stark","daylight","essenc","oh","two","good","thing","elvi","look","great","b","dog","steal","show"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,10,14,15,16,17,18,28,29,34,47,51,54,59,61,84,116,118,150,173,210,213,234,237,271,282,288,350,370,417,419,428,433,578,609,625,642,772,1074,1576,1848,1872,2113,2130,2291,2497,3940,3944,4079,5461,5827,6064,6270,6951,7068],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,10,14,15,16,17,18,28,29,34,47,51,54,59,61,84,116,118,150,173,210,213,234,237,271,282,288,350,370,417,419,428,433,578,609,625,642,772,1074,1576,1848,1872,2113,2130,2291,2497,3940,3944,4079,5461,5827,6064,6270,6951,7068],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,7.527406818957011,2.2212694515902225,2.2466628996789315,2.354379525480895,2.332712011146513,2.4368824319140248,2.687151791517189,2.8432628718938773,2.673149229007135,2.640097787510554,2.757740698455715,2.918851229218033,2.8015621426949333,3.0135689919434205,2.9958122703541616,6.386576149839587,3.1758963322079246,3.3721070011625462,3.164467636384302,3.575630765607104,3.68099128126493,3.6194333882654965,3.622422927113863,3.8059428063999263,4.110553940952155,4.848596441419991,29.391079293005745,4.911775343041523,5.00274712124725,5.02684467282631,5.259176650194926,5.274680836730892,5.850044981634453,5.850044981634453,5.822646007446338,6.600350576034347,6.389041482367141,6.489124940924123,6.725513718988353,6.600350576034347,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.7555127883707352E-4,1.753957139738451E-4,1.7543902053052525E-4,1.7540375167560867E-4,1.7542035156011348E-4,1.7539474689479202E-4,1.7544929709613634E-4,1.7536865101711843E-4,1.753957510419362E-4,1.7557700354468834E-4,1.7697015596432152E-4,1.7539604075036082E-4,1.7556215188484697E-4,1.7558044243214414E-4,1.7550068082166677E-4,1.7540444256559947E-4,1.754647884775716E-4,1.7554736280356184E-4,1.7541349794067946E-4,1.7541285661152705E-4,1.7557066714152944E-4,1.754304311889286E-4,1.7543069668768293E-4,1.7554307947028803E-4,1.754135612167451E-4,1.7558254105180582E-4,1.7545745778128685E-4,1.7539532087565624E-4,1.7547483761863505E-4,1.7552839506848952E-4,1.754312917035864E-4,1.755252488831335E-4,1.7561142739837886E-4,1.7577442203307937E-4,1.75457154585867E-4,1.7540433618002445E-4,1.7546757934899855E-4,1.754221501283658E-4,1.7536883819064587E-4,1.7541344361797368E-4,1.7558923786486182E-4,1.7549291611505994E-4,1.7552564887493338E-4,1.753775662781477E-4,1.754134882211687E-4,1.7540427022129696E-4,1.7546364297643365E-

{"value":"99.999% pure crap. And the other .001% was a brief moment where I thought the blond chick was going to disrobe. Nope.<br /><br />The dialogue was legendarily bad. The action sucked, and there was no sex (the afore mentioned blond chick is modestly dressed, alas, the whole movie). The CGI had the dubious honor of being the worst I've ever seen on film, and the anachronisms were numerous and glaring. Acting was mediocre even from Ben Cross and Marina Sirtis, the only 'names' in this movie. And Marina Sirtis looked really, really bad.<br /><br />I've seen high school plays more capably produced. This is the kind of movie that MST3K thrived on.

{"value":"The person who wrote the glowing review of this misguided project must be related to the writer/director/star--or is, in fact, the same person as it defies rational thinking that this movie would be appealing to anyone not connected to a very tightly woven inner circle. How about this? You want to make a movie--tell a story; entertain; draw me in with vivid characters. Sure, you can do it artfully without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. However, do not address elements of artistic expression in a vacuum in which the audience is in a continual struggle to grasp at skimpy narrative threads. If I'm to be moved by a dreamy psychological thread then make the concrete fabric easier to

I have a cousin that loves this show and he's the strangest and dumbest person I have met. This show should be pulled from the air. It's always the same thing over and over...

{"value":"From the beginning of the movie, it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something, what I mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made, he has gone in the opposite way, he had a type of move that he wanted to make, and wrote a story to suite it. And he has failed in it very badly. I guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. Any way I think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. In the credit of the director, he knows the media that he is working with, what I am trying to say is I have seen worst movies than this. Here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie.

{"value":"Knowing Enki Bilal's comics for quite some time, I had to see this movie. I have thought this would be a good way for the artist as Bilal to spread his art and ideas to wider audience. I have also thought this would be a good movie to recommend, and I thought I will enjoy watching it... I was wrong! The movie was a true torture to watch. The idea has potential... but, movie leaves way too much to be desired, and basically everyone who sees this movie is left with impression that he could do it better. I will not make suggestion whether you should see this movie or not. Chances are if you're reading these pages that you have already seen it, or that you're gonna see it - but be prepared for very bad 102

{"value":"This movie was physically painful to sit through, maybe because (like many people my age, and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time. \"The Cat in the Hat\" sucks all of the interest and spark out of the story, and Mike Myer's performance as the Cat is mostly bewildering. Why the Borscht Belt accent, the unfunny patter, the inappropriate jokes, the charmless costume? I had to go back and re-read the books to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE. This movie is OVERBLOWN and way, way too long.<br /><br />You don't expect every kids' movie to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this one set a new low.

{"value":"A mercilessly corny and painfully unfunny attempt to transplant the character of Sheriff Bart from Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles into his own weekly sitcom, this is really as bad as some people say it is!<br /><br />The laugh-track only serves to remind the unamused viewer what all in this supposed comedy is intended to be a joke and just how desperate for laughs it really is!<br /><br />However, it is somewhat interesting to see Louis Gossett Jr. trying his best to impersonate Cleavon Little. His embarrassment shows through in every scene.

{"value":"End Game started well, the least said about the end the better. it seemed like things we're happening just to keep the plot going, for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive, intelligent person, half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character, we are given no reason for this apart from, the next scene wouldn't make sense without it.

{"value":"This was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store. Don't make the same mistake I did. This movie is tedious, unconvincingly acted, and generally boring. The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered; I cringed at every scene they shared. Dennis Hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self; his role was clearly not a stretch for him. And although the movie is supposedly set in Puerto Rico, it feels a lot more like a Hollywood movie lot; all of the main characters are Caucasian and several tend to speak English with pseudo-Irish accents. Odd.

{"value":"I believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war, avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles. Zvezda barely does the first. Zvezda being a Russian war film, I was expecting patriotism, sentimentality, beautiful poetic pictures, a lush score, Slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans. What I didn't need was the naive love non-affair, the unrealistically silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references (Stalinism, Nazism, Holocaust) only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history endnote about \"liberating Poland\".

{"value":"The \"documentary\", and we use that term loosely apparently, summarizes that Muslims are trying to violently take over the world. Then states that any Muslim that doesn't admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face! Also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them. What the West NEEDS to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets. If you are looking for an actual documentary on Islam and the current state of the Middle-East I would look elsewhere. Try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified

There is no science fiction... well, hardly any. At the end of every episode we can catch a glimpse of a Cylon. That's all. Who cares this? Did they decide that the next show's target audience will be females under 18? Boring religious nonsense talking, moaning, bitching... and some more.<br /><br />It is just sad that there is nothing out there at the moment to watch.

{"value":"Now, I won't deny that when I purchased this off eBay, I had high expectations. This was an incredible out-of-print work from the master of comedy that I so enjoy. However, I was soon to be disappointed. Apologies to those who enjoyed it, but I just found the Compleat Al to be very difficult to watch. I got a few smiles, sure, but the majority of the funny came from the music videos (which I've got on DVD) and the rest was basically filler. You could tell that this was not Al's greatest video achievement (that honor goes to UHF). Honestly, I doubt if this will ever make the jump to DVD, so if you're an ultra-hardcore Al fan and just HAVE to own everything, buy the tape off eBay. Just don't pay too much for it.","finished_norm":["now","i","wo","not","deni","that","when","i","purchas","thi","off","ebai","i","have","high","expect","thi","be","a","incred","outofprint","work","from","the","master","of","comedi","that","i","so","enjoi","howev","i","be","soon","to","be","disappoint","apologi","to","that","who","enjoi","it","but","i","just","find","the","compleat","al","to","be","veri","difficult","to","watch","i","get","a","few","smile","sure","but","the","major","of","the","funni","come","from","the","music","video","which","i","have","get","on","dvd","and","the","rest","be","basic","filler","you","can","tell","that","thi","be","not","al","great","video","achiev","that","honor","go","to","uhf","honestli","i","doubt","if","thi","will","ever","make","the","jump","to","dvd","so","if","you","re","a","ultrahardcor","al","fan","and","just","have","to","own","everyth","bui","the","tape","off","ebai","just","do","not","pai","too","much","for","it"],"filtered":["wo","deni","purchas","thi","ebai","high","expect","thi","incred","outofprint","work","master","comedi","enjoi","howev","soon","disappoint","apologi","enjoi","find","compleat","al","veri","difficult","watch","get","smile","sure","major","funni","come","music","video","get","dvd","rest","basic","filler","tell","thi","al","great","video","achiev","honor","go","uhf","honestli","doubt","thi","ever","make","jump","dvd","re","ultrahardcor","al","fan","everyth","bui","tape","ebai","pai","much"],"filtered2":["wo","deni","purchas","ebai","high","expect","incred","outofprint","work","master","comedi","enjoi","howev","soon","disappoint","apologi","enjoi","find","compleat","al","veri","difficult","watch","get","smile","sure","major","funni","come","music","video","get","dvd","rest","basic","filler","tell","al","great","video","achiev","honor","go","uhf","honestli","doubt","ever","make","jump","dvd","re","ultrahardcor","al","fan","everyth","bui","tape","ebai","pai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,7,15,34,38,44,48,51,62,68,90,113,118,119,127,130,140,187,193,200,211,226,240,247,286,322,347,404,406,449,567,674,757,803,1059,1164,1301,1317,1403,1418,2050,2377,2628,3224,4805,8126],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,7,15,34,38,44,48,51,62,68,90,113,118,119,127,130,140,187,193,200,211,226,240,247,286,322,347,404,406,449,567,674,757,803,1059,1164,1301,1317,1403,1418,2050,2377,2628,3224,4805,8126],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.2000607798565692,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,2.0477128419653545,2.1521782565202803,2.354379525480895,2.1653408989309972,2.4359679371086367,2.2642139034199635,2.317169775997098,2.4732161909892554,2.517840471459249,5.061642365863941,2.5687161421197025,2.5940874818617203,5.533214255322713,5.460751613699401,2.780700890737216,2.885344817328191,3.0151989841543516,3.1419947805322432,3.121829110937649,3.2597778161886266,3.454678155189441,3.6405503117064195,3.7165362186843414,3.7636829971100436,4.224077767249142,4.268777946167049,4.390138803171316,13.938216531925551,4.550761997504193,4.550761997504193,5.02684467282631,5.156897801074508,5.290429193699031,5.5623629091826725,6.0662680901040895,14.071337294584385]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.194497759780536E-4,2.1925531043720604E-4,2.1930944626706038E-4,2.1926535805328194E-4,2.1928610891855605E-4,2.1925410152956972E-4,2.1932229259911856E-4,2.1922148009526654E-4,2.1925535677457447E-4,2.194819334272079E-4,2.2122345868647714E-4,2.1925571892772599E-4,2.194633679490941E-4,2.1948623224568866E-4,2.193865253813077E-4,2.1926622170779196E-4,2.19341657768134E-4,2.1944488069798186E-4,2.1927754147741066E-4,2.1927673977696301E-4,2.1947401253786467E-4,2.1929870906764112E-4,2.1929904095723226E-4,2.1943952627086744E-4,2.1927762057634133E-4,2.1948885564790864E-4,2.193324939519083E-4,2.1925481904056082E-4,2.1935421980567515E-4,2.1942116987548024E-4,2.1929978476330182E-4,2.1941723695242702E-4,2.1952496533805883E-4,2.1972871854514226E-4,2.1933211493919247E-4,2.192660887193526E-4,2.193451465271649E-4,2.192883572382645E-4,2.1922171407356018E-4,2.1927747357072442E-4,2.1949722707154416E-4,2.1937681902578192E-4,2.194177369665053E-4,2.1923262471379977E-4,2.1927752932743104E-4,2.1926600626693144E-4,2.1934022582203959E-4,2.1937825969134967E-4,2.193336503619009E-4,2.1929888559081096E-4,2.192665484949164E-4,2.197157900444469E-4,2.19321722274647E-4,2.1927747906929973E-4,2.1932054772559208E-4,2.1925504336804658E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630277E-4,2.1926685631708622E-4,2.1925491821167642E-4,2.194303274057623E-4,2.1934224257171356E-4,2.1925482655736362E-4,2.1923253539347102E-4,2.1921048914035578E-4,2.19408690123213E-4,2.1926556769286492E-4,2.19365

{"value":"This movie is so bad, it's comical. In fact, Mystery Science Theatre 3000, the television show in which three characters watch and parody bad movies, used this very film to mock. I suggest watching it (maybe on YouTube) instead of actually seeing this movie.<br /><br />Please, do not see Hobgoblins if you're not prepared to stop within the first scene. Actually, do not see this movie, period. Please. At least not seriously. Its jokes are not funny (to say the least), and you'll have much more fun parodying or watching a parody of it then viewing the movie.<br /><br />You may feel yourself becoming sick upon watching, so spare yourself. Read a book. Do the laundry. Anything is more fun than watching Hobgoblins.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","so","bad","it","comic","in","fact","mysteri","scienc","theatr","the","televis","show","in","which","three","charact","watch","and","parodi","bad","movi","us","thi","veri","film","to","mock","i","suggest","watch","it","mayb","on","youtub","instead","of","actual","see","thi","moviebr","br","pleas","do","not","see","hobgoblin","if","you","re","not","prepar","to","stop","within","the","scene","actual","do","not","see","thi","movi","period","pleas","at","littl","not","serious","it","joke","be","not","funni","to","sai","the","littl","and","you","will","have","much","much","fun","parodi","or","watch","a","parodi","of","it","then","view","the","moviebr","br","you","mai","feel","yourself","becom","sick","upon","watch","so","spare","yourself","read","a","book","do","the","laundri","anyth","be","much","fun","than","watch","hobgoblin"],"filtered":["thi","movi","bad","comic","fact","mysteri","scienc","theatr","televis","show","three","charact","watch","parodi","bad","movi","us","thi","veri","film","mock","suggest","watch","mayb","youtub","instead","actual","see","thi","moviebr","br","pleas","see","hobgoblin","re","prepar","stop","within","scene","actual","see","thi","movi","period","pleas","littl","serious","joke","funni","sai","littl","much","much","fun","parodi","watch","parodi","view","moviebr","br","mai","feel","becom","sick","upon","watch","spare","read","book","laundri","anyth","much","fun","watch","hobgoblin"],"filtered2":["bad","comic","fact","mysteri","scienc","theatr","televis","show","three","charact","watch","parodi","bad","us","veri","mock","suggest","watch","mayb","youtub","instead","actual","see","moviebr","pleas","see","hobgoblin","re","prepar","stop","within","scene","actual","see","period","pleas","littl","serious","joke","funni","littl","fun","parodi","watch","parodi","view","moviebr","mai","feel","becom","sick","upon","watch","spare","read","book","laundri","anyth","fun","watch","hobgoblin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,9,10,14,15,19,28,43,46,52,56,62,68,97,104,115,145,151,152,163,214,224,259,312,315,346,371,403,465,480,630,646,663,672,743,778,910,1118,1294,1295,2107,2711,3703,3913,7268],"values":[3.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,9,10,14,15,19,28,43,46,52,56,62,68,97,104,115,145,151,152,163,214,224,259,312,315,346,371,403,465,480,630,646,663,672,743,778,910,1118,1294,1295,2107,2711,3703,3913,7268],"values":[1.967100616408184,4.804748860361466,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,1.5452294193519092,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,3.4244306149452273,1.8610609350701788,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,2.0545557924622586,2.0728240170322856,2.201553588425805,2.34599021453259,2.8002454868101863,2.3131195476980753,2.4000574358028657,2.7303758068497004,2.689504733779216,5.492910624448097,2.8824835850471584,2.854312708080462,6.046778076248792,3.0466846007279185,3.189397019426827,6.5362921317182865,3.43462735814388,3.558633189238533,3.5900195030592035,3.7297814454343623,3.616452760127359,3.7568101178222815,3.8059428063999263,4.096025840389245,4.34596758485818,13.815750548364786,4.358390104856736,4.933754249760298,5.426230734858092,12.596139408322827,5.7959777603641776,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079186E-4,1.9803239209117182E-4,1.9808128781854337E-4,1.9804146714364084E-4,1.9806020941939232E-4,1.980313002003047E-4,1.9809289068399737E-4,1.9800183637269834E-4,1.9803243394329344E-4,1.9823707900490465E-4,1.9981003252786644E-4,1.9803276104166453E-4,1.9822031058076088E-4,1.982409617172787E-4,1.9815090602457098E-4,1.9804224720031642E-4,1.9811038139259517E-4,1.9820361281160012E-4,1.980524712676425E-4,1.9805174716815743E-4,1.9822992482167873E-4,1.9807158993126703E-4,1.9807188969545297E-4,1.981987766687143E-4,1.9805254271015586E-4,1.9824333118607744E-4,1.981021045921645E-4,1.980319482594903E-4,1.9812172748195033E-4,1.981821970890387E-4,1.9807256150447284E-4,1.9817864485507643E-4,1.9827594562220606E-4,1.984599764441484E-4,1.9810176226615832E-4,1.9804212708455403E-4,1.9811353245559538E-4,1.980622401119633E-4,1.9800204770295573E-4,1.9805240993401509E-4,1.982508922939222E-4,1.9814213920018063E-4,1.9817909647006264E-4,1.9801190224276861E-4,1.9805246029372574E-4,1.9804205261315282E-4,1.9810908805237978E-4,1.981434404158639E-4,1.981031490669214E-4,1.9807174936779568E-4,1.9804254235593124E-4,1.9844829936360812E-4,1.9809237556434462E-4,1.9805241490035327E-4,1.9809131470630424E-4,1.980321508730942E-4,0.9843481445040683,1.9806304719570546E-4,1.9804282038231294E-4,1.9803203783129227E-4,1.9819046821197654E-4,1.9811090958984397E-4,1.9803195504870073E-4,1.9801182156824207E-4,1.979919092923097E-4,1.981709253201166E-4,1.980416564910642E-4,1.981316788621357E-4,1.9

{"value":"I guess this goes to prove that Joe Don Baker will do anything for a buck. The concept of the film wasn't very good to start with. This movie has so many bad things about it I don't know where to start. The acting is horrible. The cinematography is marginal at best. The soundtrack was pretty bad. The score is terrible. There's a reason why this movie ended up on Mystery Science Theater 3000. I voted before I wrote this and I cannot believe that 9 people actually thought this \"film\" is excellent. They must have liked the two go-go dancers. Final justice would be if they locked this stinker in the film vault outside Wichita and never let anyone see it again! A 1 out of 10 rating is far better than this deserves.","finished_norm":["i","guess","thi","go","to","prove","that","joe","don","baker","will","do","anyth","for","a","buck","the","concept","of","the","film","be","not","veri","good","to","start","with","thi","movi","have","so","mani","bad","thing","about","it","i","do","not","know","where","to","start","the","act","be","horribl","the","cinematographi","be","margin","at","well","the","soundtrack","be","pretti","bad","the","score","be","terribl","there","a","reason","why","thi","movi","end","up","on","mysteri","scienc","theater","i","vote","befor","i","write","thi","and","i","cannot","believ","that","peopl","actual","think","thi","film","be","excel","thei","must","have","like","the","two","gogo","dancer","final","justic","would","be","if","thei","lock","thi","stinker","in","the","film","vault","outsid","wichita","and","never","let","anyon","see","it","again","a","out","of","rate","be","far","well","than","thi","deserv"],"filtered":["guess","thi","go","prove","joe","baker","anyth","buck","concept","film","veri","good","start","thi","movi","mani","bad","thing","know","start","act","horribl","cinematographi","margin","well","soundtrack","pretti","bad","score","terribl","reason","thi","movi","end","mysteri","scienc","theater","vote","befor","write","thi","believ","peopl","actual","think","thi","film","excel","thei","must","like","two","gogo","dancer","final","justic","thei","lock","thi","stinker","film","vault","outsid","wichita","never","let","anyon","see","rate","far","well","thi","deserv"],"filtered2":["guess","go","prove","joe","baker","anyth","buck","concept","veri","good","start","mani","bad","thing","know","start","act","horribl","cinematographi","margin","well","soundtrack","pretti","bad","score","terribl","reason","end","mysteri","scienc","theater","vote","befor","write","believ","peopl","actual","think","excel","must","like","two","gogo","dancer","final","justic","lock","stinker","vault","outsid","wichita","never","let","anyon","see","rate","far","well","deserv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,9,12,15,20,21,23,24,26,29,42,47,50,52,65,71,78,79,91,95,101,104,124,141,156,158,166,202,230,243,403,423,424,518,540,580,629,725,791,796,821,910,1189,1318,1407,1424,1929,2063,2553,3523,4963],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,9,12,15,20,21,23,24,26,29,42,47,50,52,65,71,78,79,91,95,101,104,124,141,156,158,166,202,230,243,403,423,424,518,540,580,629,725,791,796,821,910,1189,1318,1407,1424,1929,2063,2553,3523,4963],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,2.1367141713444147,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.6219954307453837,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,1.9073850067444174,3.8429853485101932,2.0064197866819473,1.9469506069506084,2.0105926690411424,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.2323930368088845,2.2657547357741192,2.3451551414151686,2.3106972614914807,2.4423870329693536,2.597304642813496,2.7121382192999195,2.627841366673578,3.189397019426827,3.164467636384302,3.212973749990824,3.4101163271295305,3.432149042129413,3.5039747767006686,3.488143311483988,3.7034641371169887,3.8240921249056035,3.850067611308864,4.339813719283801,4.096025840389245,4.291900363587903,4.436351646326448,4.443131333311827,4.5432147918688095,4.8184434032493035,5.3064295350454715,5.501738287366237,5.626901430320244,6.137727054086234]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612987E-4,2.116930065387444E-4,2.117452751773488E-4,2.1170270760391548E-4,2.1172274275403063E-4,2.1169183932737037E-4,2.1175767842838508E-4,2.116603430343434E-4,2.116930512778972E-4,2.1191181310725406E-4,2.1359327166514593E-4,2.116934009400756E-4,2.1189388796841982E-4,2.119159636557947E-4,2.118196957667695E-4,2.1170354147023994E-4,2.117763756760952E-4,2.1187603835847064E-4,2.117144708112859E-4,2.11713696762175E-4,2.1190416541618477E-4,2.117349083131559E-4,2.117352287555901E-4,2.1187086861014444E-4,2.1171454718202655E-4,2.119184965746198E-4,2.1176752792775874E-4,2.1169253209079135E-4,2.1178850443817645E-4,2.1185314534259405E-4,2.1173594690714973E-4,2.1184934806943353E-4,2.1195336081055474E-4,2.1215008639459372E-4,2.1176716198751687E-4,2.1170341306868604E-4,2.1177974410483186E-4,2.1172491352726205E-4,2.116605689425248E-4,2.1171440524675957E-4,2.1192657926066683E-4,2.1181032419177918E-4,2.1184983083759695E-4,2.116711032654152E-4,2.1171445908036953E-4,2.117033334601197E-4,2.11774993119051E-4,2.1181171516755463E-4,2.1176864445217786E-4,2.1173507874789005E-4,2.117038569861959E-4,2.121376038089871E-4,2.1175712777489418E-4,2.117144105556843E-4,2.1175599373704455E-4,2.1169274868102953E-4,0.9832684526
