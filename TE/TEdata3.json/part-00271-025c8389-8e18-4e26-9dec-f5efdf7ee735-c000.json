{"value":"Yes, In 35 years of film going I have finally viewed the stinker that surpasses all other ghastly movies I have seen. Beating 'Good Will Hunting' Baise Moi' and 'Flirt' for sheer awfulness. This is pretentious blige of the first order... not even entertaining pretentious bilge. The effects are cheap, and worse - pointless.<br /><br />The script seems to have been written by a first year film student who doesn't get out much but wants to appear full of portent! The acting is simply undescribably bad - Tilda Swinton caps a career filled with vacuous woodeness with a performance which veers neurotically between comotose and laughable 'intensity'.

But what makes it worth watching is the scene where OJ angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric \"I got the evidence on you!\". (Makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to David Gregoli and Leslie Oren but i couldn't find it on iTunes). Talk about seeing into the future...Too funny for words. The rest of the movie is forgettable. The score and songs are more interesting than the script. Ditto the sequel. Which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all. My understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these B movies. Doesn't say much for the world's viewing habits.","finished_norm":["thi","be","realli","realli","bad","lama","show","just","how","a","rate","actor","doe","hi","job","but","what","make","it","worth","watch","be","the","scene","where","oj","angrili","grab","a","fellow","cop","by","the","throat","a","if","to","kill","them","while","the","jukebox","plai","a","song","with","the","lyric","i","get","the","evid","on","you","make","me","want","to","hear","the","rest","of","the","lyric","attribut","to","david","gregoli","and","lesli","oren","but","i","can","not","find","it","on","itun","talk","about","see","into","the","futuretoo","funni","for","word","the","rest","of","the","movi","be","forgett","the","score","and","song","be","much","interest","than","the","script","ditto","the","sequel","which","beg","the","question","of","why","thei","would","do","a","sequel","at","all","my","understand","be","that","foreign","sale","drive","a","lot","of","thi","b","movi","doe","not","sai","much","for","the","world","view","habit"],"filtered":["thi","realli","realli","bad","lama","show","rate","actor","doe","hi","job","make","worth","watch","scene","oj","angrili","grab","fellow","cop","throat","kill","jukebox","plai","song","lyric","get","evid","make","want","hear","rest","lyric","attribut","david","gregoli","lesli","oren","find","itun","talk","see","futuretoo","funni","word","rest","movi","forgett","score","song","much","interest","script","ditto","sequel","beg","question","thei","sequel","understand","foreign","sale","drive","lot","thi","b","movi","doe","sai","much","world","view","habit"],"filtered2":["realli","realli","bad","lama","show","rate","actor","doe","job","make","worth","watch","scene","oj","angrili","grab","fellow","cop","throat","kill","jukebox","plai","song","lyric","get","evid","make","want","hear","rest","lyric","attribut","david","gregoli","lesli","oren","find","itun","talk","see","futuretoo","funni","word","rest","forgett","score","song","interest","script","ditto","sequel","beg","question","sequel","understand","foreign","sale","drive","lot","b","doe","world","view","habit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,7,9,13,18,19,28,37,38,40,41,60,62,72,76,77,165,186,202,212,216,219,226,258,289,312,328,378,387,461,476,518,642,675,1015,1391,1517,1550,1770,1933,1966,2962,3084,3150,3358,3480,4142,6782,7725],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,7,9,13,18,19,28,37,38,40,41,60,62,72,76,77,165,186,202,212,216,219,226,258,289,312,328,378,387,461,476,518,642,675,1015,1391,1517,1550,1770,1933,1966,2962,3084,3150,3358,3480,4142,6782,7725],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,2.2635883139467947,2.430631986809635,1.312380678011735,1.5452294193519092,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.838176641236591,2.0226120445069267,1.9209463754160525,2.1337665533324026,1.9463902258768238,2.448847599972298,2.571852579609833,2.597304642813496,2.5983793339432615,2.6070186965339692,2.5792094178355414,5.188174963723441,2.7061321952397077,2.8282659991423613,2.8824835850471584,6.310084991849437,3.130944944345658,6.721038771980316,3.358217889001879,3.6105180246075443,3.4101163271295305,3.622422927113863,3.749984152751882,4.086456389373095,4.429617614145104,4.550761997504193,4.558366596889411,4.789173020949191,4.869215728622727,4.85885294158718,10.926544013076883,5.463272006538442,5.649374286172302,5.604922523601468,5.604922523601468,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852437E-4,2.081041609493374E-4,2.0815554347424262E-4,2.0811369755170683E-4,2.081333930445924E-4,2.081030135257753E-4,2.081677364521409E-4,2.0807205119149433E-4,2.0810420493002442E-4,2.0831925807556948E-4,2.099722193300261E-4,2.0810454866435668E-4,2.0830163682280354E-4,2.0832333825958522E-4,2.0822870240647177E-4,2.0811451728144017E-4,2.0818611672416973E-4,2.0828408981847648E-4,2.08125261336642E-4,2.0812450041003707E-4,2.0831174003631446E-4,2.081453523601864E-4,2.0814566737013877E-4,2.0827900771323675E-4,2.081253364126644E-4,2.083258282376694E-4,2.08177418972298E-4,2.08103694544732E-4,2.0819803986654243E-4,2.0826158490941737E-4,2.0814637334682734E-4,2.0825785201168077E-4,2.083601014178987E-4,2.0855349190005524E-4,2.0817705923586533E-4,2.081143910566863E-4,2.0818942804771046E-4,2.0813552701656114E-4,2.0807227326983936E-4,2.0812519688363543E-4,2.0833377389740346E-4,2.0821948970841422E-4,2.082583265954435E-4,2.0808262900365467E-4,2.0812524980460065E-4,2.0811431279772925E-4,2.0818475760570683E-4,2.0822085710288504E-4,2.0817851656820455E-4,2.081455199055292E-4,2.0811482744843314E-4,2.0854122093255084E-4,2.081671951339152E-4,2.0812520210255762E-4,2.081660803214845E-4,2.0810390746310153E-4,0.9835521036604975,2.0813

{"value":"OMG! The only reason I'm giving this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because Tom Hanks is funny as an Elvis-in-the-box. Apart from that, how did this halfway decent cast sign on to do such a lame movie?? Maybe it seemed like a good idea at the time... There are no laughs to mention, the stereotypes are pathetic, the cast is wasted, the direction is amateurish. Now that I think about it, most of the blame probably lies with the director, Joel Zwick. He brings out nothing but flat performances from all involved. Don't waste your time like I did; but then, I enjoy a good train wreck. Geez, now the system is telling me I need more lines-- here ya go: This movie should be called Return to Sender.

{"value":"Although it got some favorable press after playing at the Toronto Intl. Film Festival, there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this. One -- it's an ultra-low budget Canadian film. Two -- it's written, directed and starring the same person (usually a bad sign, unless it's Woody Allen, George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers). But despite my watching it with lowered expectations, it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than I thought possible.<br /><br />In a nutshell -- bad script, bad acting, terrible directing! Don't waste your time or money on this turkey. It claims to be a comedy, but I only laughed twice. Plus, there is awful music blaring throughout.

{"value":"Herculis Puaro is, in general, a well established 'hero' we know well from books and movies. This movie or this story don't work and i felt its not Agatha's mistake. The cast isn't good, the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures, the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything (even Arab clothes) look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama. The actor playing Herculis Puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic. The scenes are, as said before, perfect and looking fake. The story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond 45+ woman in the iraqi desert?!

{"value":"The movie is an extra-long tale of a classic novel that completely fails to capture the original adventure's spirit. The quite horribly American Patrick Swayze is cast as the British hero Allan Quatermain despite the obviousness of his nationality.<br /><br />The movie continues throughout to \"Hollywood-ise\" the story by changing both the plot and the characters to fit more comfortably into the accepted mold. The movie manages to be predictable throughout, even to those who are not familiar with the story and is plagued by some extremely bad acting and terribly disappointing fight sequences.<br /><br />All

{"value":"OK first of all the video looks like it was filmed in the 80s I was shocked to find out it was released in 2001. Secondly the plot was all over the place, right off the bat the story is confusing. Had there been some brief prologue or introduction the story would've been better. Also I appreciate fantasy but this film was too much. It was bizarre and badly filmed. The scenes did not flow smoothly and the characters were odd. It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic films but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film i would recommend the Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) not this film. Beware you will be disappointed.","finished_norm":["okai","of","all","the","video","look","like","it","be","film","in","the","i","be","shock","to","find","out","it","be","releas","in","secondli","the","plot","be","all","over","the","place","right","off","the","bat","the","stori","be","confus","have","there","be","some","brief","prologu","or","introduct","the","stori","would","have","be","well","conjur","i","appreci","fantasi","but","thi","film","be","too","much","it","be","bizarr","and","badli","film","the","scene","do","not","flow","smoothli","and","the","charact","be","odd","it","be","hard","to","follow","and","mayb","it","be","the","translat","but","it","be","even","hard","to","understand","i","love","chines","epic","film","but","if","you","re","look","for","a","chines","epic","fantasi","film","i","would","recommend","the","promis","visual","stun","the","plot","be","interest","and","good","charact","develop","not","thi","film","bewar","you","will","be","disappoint"],"filtered":["okai","video","look","like","film","shock","find","releas","secondli","plot","place","right","bat","stori","confus","brief","prologu","introduct","stori","well","conjur","appreci","fantasi","thi","film","much","bizarr","badli","film","scene","flow","smoothli","charact","odd","hard","follow","mayb","translat","even","hard","understand","love","chines","epic","film","re","look","chines","epic","fantasi","film","recommend","promis","visual","stun","plot","interest","good","charact","develop","thi","film","bewar","disappoint"],"filtered2":["okai","video","look","like","shock","find","releas","secondli","plot","place","right","bat","stori","confus","brief","prologu","introduct","stori","well","conjur","appreci","fantasi","bizarr","badli","scene","flow","smoothli","charact","odd","hard","follow","mayb","translat","even","hard","understand","love","chines","epic","re","look","chines","epic","fantasi","recommend","promis","visual","stun","plot","interest","good","charact","develop","bewar","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,10,16,17,19,20,32,38,39,54,60,68,121,163,164,171,187,191,212,240,260,298,320,327,427,448,508,635,683,772,823,961,996,1186,1432,1474,1556,1567,1672,1899,2288,2478,4339,5630],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,10,16,17,19,20,32,38,39,54,60,68,121,163,164,171,187,191,212,240,260,298,320,327,427,448,508,635,683,772,823,961,996,1186,1432,1474,1556,1567,1672,1899,2288,2478,4339,5630],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,2.247774048205673,2.393227744058217,2.5541073880211935,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,2.742262257014735,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,2.0064197866819473,2.2190595059394194,2.4000574358028657,2.3930275298746078,4.746175108181524,2.4732161909892554,2.5460113484259455,2.5983793339432615,2.7666071276613566,2.6754694156628323,2.7819920465008363,2.938298364153555,2.9674191958529437,3.233054746047873,3.2681460658591432,3.4149707055943286,3.587125145032839,3.6105180246075443,3.8059428063999263,3.850067611308864,3.9954846111673676,8.260518024062975,4.2574141875167335,4.558366596889411,5.089758498236879,4.589376833631972,9.359947457968397,10.258997653772786,4.828393734102471,5.089758498236879,5.129498826886393,5.967828017290836,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164644E-4,2.23242758127842E-4,2.2329787848933348E-4,2.2325298847309988E-4,2.2327411672029302E-4,2.2324152723462206E-4,2.2331095844892383E-4,2.2320831253640831E-4,2.2324280530791675E-4,2.2347350255652793E-4,2.2524669975505104E-4,2.232431740473021E-4,2.2345459944064983E-4,2.234778795547061E-4,2.2337635938917717E-4,2.2325386783430897E-4,2.233306757991399E-4,2.234357759744347E-4,2.2326539346890367E-4,2.2326457718847348E-4,2.2346543761534005E-4,2.2328694601974746E-4,2.232872839451896E-4,2.234303241699843E-4,2.2326547400635297E-4,2.2348055066696376E-4,2.2332134532680094E-4,2.2324225779449911E-4,2.233434662939416E-4,2.2341163393927861E-4,2.232880412783559E-4,2.2340762949082005E-4,2.2351731705956877E-4,2.2372477578809854E-4,2.233209594212378E-4,2.23253732427299E-4,2.2333422800586614E-4,2.232764059286678E-4,2.2320855076990656E-4,2.2326532432724456E-4,2.2348907433600567E-4,2.233664765107437E-4,2.2340813859831541E-4,2.232196598345635E-4,2.2326538109796061E-4,2.2325364847537157E-4,2.2332921781121262E-4,2.2336794337671944E-4,2.233225227676381E-4,2.232871257532245E-4,2.2325420056448927E-4,2.2371161216552568E-4,2.2331037775234774E-4,2.2326532992581873E-4,2.2330918184256543E-4,2.2324248620167678E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760406E-4,2.2325451398481225E-4,2.2324235876917256E-4,2.234209580113557E-4,2.2333127123814567E-4,2.2324226544800493E-4,2.232195688898265E-4,2.2319712169645173E-4,2.233989272262173E-4,2.232532019252558E-4,2.233546845271

{"value":"Considering the original film version of 'The Haunting\" is in my top ten films of all time' I approached this adaption with trepidation. I was right to be cautious as this film is a poorly written and badly executed load of old tosh, all those involved should be ashamed. the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason! you see nothing. Robert Wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's. The shame of the new version is that it relies on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, sadder still is that the ingredients were there (actors such as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something different. This film should only watched as an example of studio butchery!","finished_norm":["consid","the","origin","film","version","of","the","haunt","be","in","my","top","ten","film","of","all","time","i","approach","thi","adapt","with","trepid","i","be","right","to","be","cautiou","a","thi","film","be","a","poorli","write","and","badli","execut","load","of","old","tosh","all","that","involv","should","be","asham","the","origin","be","terrifi","to","me","a","a","child","for","on","reason","you","see","noth","robert","wise","us","innov","camerawork","and","superb","light","to","gener","fear","and","thi","be","why","it","work","the","shame","of","the","new","version","be","that","it","reli","on","clever","special","effect","and","pyrotechn","to","get","from","a","to","b","sad","still","be","that","the","ingredi","be","there","actor","such","a","liam","neeson","catherin","zeta","jone","to","do","someth","differ","thi","film","should","onli","watch","a","a","exampl","of","studio","butcheri"],"filtered":["consid","origin","film","version","haunt","top","ten","film","time","approach","thi","adapt","trepid","right","cautiou","thi","film","poorli","write","badli","execut","load","old","tosh","involv","asham","origin","terrifi","child","reason","see","noth","robert","wise","us","innov","camerawork","superb","light","gener","fear","thi","work","shame","new","version","reli","clever","special","effect","pyrotechn","get","b","sad","still","ingredi","actor","liam","neeson","catherin","zeta","jone","someth","differ","thi","film","onli","watch","exampl","studio","butcheri"],"filtered2":["consid","origin","version","haunt","top","ten","time","approach","adapt","trepid","right","cautiou","poorli","write","badli","execut","load","old","tosh","involv","asham","origin","terrifi","child","reason","see","noth","robert","wise","us","innov","camerawork","superb","light","gener","fear","work","shame","new","version","reli","clever","special","effect","pyrotechn","get","b","sad","still","ingredi","actor","liam","neeson","catherin","zeta","jone","someth","differ","onli","watch","exampl","studio","butcheri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,8,11,41,48,49,53,56,64,65,67,69,87,95,106,121,180,203,204,220,225,241,307,317,353,364,398,448,455,539,545,574,642,662,701,812,932,955,1078,1195,1262,1296,1426,1584,1635,1968,2386,2484,2695,2747,3138,5746,7083,7636],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,8,11,41,48,49,53,56,64,65,67,69,87,95,106,121,180,203,204,220,225,241,307,317,353,364,398,448,455,539,545,574,642,662,701,812,932,955,1078,1195,1262,1296,1426,1584,1635,1968,2386,2484,2695,2747,3138,5746,7083,7636],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,1.8610609350701788,1.883428577602134,1.9073850067444174,1.9570915389266579,4.254065042302116,2.115024371522662,2.0323326556775485,2.159084361316692,2.2190595059394194,2.7097314792693545,2.569760528637609,2.624524614047584,5.667386841755453,2.641219492619754,2.6627744961815836,2.8767855639325206,2.8529247828056143,3.0266839340212486,2.9878441007049847,3.143848349181566,3.2681460658591432,3.2787058260741455,3.6105180246075443,3.442099372982581,3.5039747767006686,3.622422927113863,3.616452760127359,3.8240921249056035,3.952924996748572,4.058285512406398,4.017463517886143,4.186539847930077,4.422928625994308,4.528289141652134,4.370968887063596,4.449957298382227,4.597282013139085,4.654440426979034,4.8796870284900224,5.143104478942172,5.3064295350454715,5.274680836730892,5.3560264761848435,5.5623629091826725,6.489124940924123,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852453E-4,2.0810416094933757E-4,2.0815554347424276E-4,2.0811369755170697E-4,2.0813339304459253E-4,2.0810301352577543E-4,2.0816773645214104E-4,2.080720511914945E-4,2.0810420493002455E-4,2.0831925807556964E-4,2.099722107549352E-4,2.0810454866435684E-4,2.083016368228037E-4,2.0832333825958539E-4,2.0822870240647193E-4,2.081145172814403E-4,2.0818611672416987E-4,2.0828408981847662E-4,2.0812526133664216E-4,2.081245004100372E-4,2.0831174003631462E-4,2.0814535236018657E-4,2.081456673701389E-4,2.0827900771323689E-4,2.0812533641266455E-4,2.0832582823766954E-4,2.0817741897229816E-4,2.0810369454473215E-4,2.081980398665426E-4,2.0826158490941754E-4,2.081463733468275E-4,2.082578520116809E-4,2.0836010141789884E-4,2.085534919000554E-4,2.081770592358655E-4,2.0811439105668646E-4,2.081894280477106E-4,2.0813552701656128E-4,2.0807227326983952E-4,2.081251968836356E-4,2.083337738974036E-4,2.0821948970841438E-4,2.0825832659544363E-4,2.080826290036548E-4,2.0812524980460078E-4,2.0811431279772942E-4,2.0818475760570697E-4,2.0822085710288518E-4,2.0817851656820469E-4,2.0814551990552937E-4,

{"value":"Cliché-ridden story of an impending divorce - or is it? - through the eyes of a 6 year-old child. Corny dialogue, cardboard characters, stock situations, a red herring zombie sub-plot and, worst of all, absolutely no payoff, either emotionally or dramatically.<br /><br />Does no-one teach creative writing any more? The true sign of a weak storyteller - when you cannot create any kind of satisfying denouement - just end the story. I'm compelled to ask, \"what made you think this was a story worth telling in the first place!?\" <br /><br />Good, but wasted, debut by child actor Anthony De Marco - the rest of the cast was, at best, forgettable. And they wonder why no-one watches indie films!

{"value":"Belmondo is a tough cop. He goes after a big-time drug dealer (played by Henry Silva, normally a great villain - see \"Sharky's Machine\"; but here he is clearly dubbed, and because of that he lacks his usual charisma). He goes to the scuzziest places of Paris and Marseilles, asks for some names, beats up some people, gets the names, goes to more scuzzy places, asks for more names, beats up more people, etc. The whole movie is punch after punch after punch. It seems that the people who made it had no other ambition than to create the French equivalent of \"Dirty Harry\". Belmondo, who was 50 here, does perform some good stunts at the beginning; apart from those, \"Le Marginal\" is a violent, episodic, trite, shallow and forgettable cop movie.

{"value":"This one probably does not fit in the bottom of the barrel of mediocre Slasher movies but it's surely a damn bad movie.<br /><br />The Holiday premise made it kind of interesting but after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it's poor production values and stupid plot. I mean, the sub-genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons but this one took it too far. There is absolutely no coherence in the events or nothing else to add.<br /><br />The clichès are more than boring, the gore is minimal, and so does the mystery.<br /><br />This is a fairly mediocre slasher entry that shouldn't be hyped even if it has a video nastie label.<br /><br />I am truly disappointed by this overrated piece of

{"value":"Mike Hawthorne(Gordon Currie)is witness to the brutal murder of his mother and suicide of his father Morty(Jon Fedele). Twenty years later, Mike gathers a group of his friends to his family's cabin in the woods for a Halloween party. While playing a game where the guests confess and confront their worst fears...Mike tries to summon the spirit of his late father. It is soon discovered that Morty's spirit inhabits a wooden Indian in the cabin. The statue comes to life and the blood bath begins.<br /><br />Most of the F/X are not very convincing and the movie takes on a cheap teen slasher theme. Stale story pitifully acted. Cast members of note are: Kelly Benson, Phillip Rhys, Emmanuelle Vaugier, Byron Chief-Moon and veteran actress Betsy Palmer.","finished_norm":["mike","hawthornegordon","curriei","wit","to","the","brutal","murder","of","hi","mother","and","suicid","of","hi","father","mortyjon","fedel","twenti","year","late","mike","gather","a","group","of","hi","friend","to","hi","famili","cabin","in","the","wood","for","a","halloween","parti","while","plai","a","game","where","the","guest","confess","and","confront","their","wrong","fearsmik","try","to","summon","the","spirit","of","hi","late","father","it","be","soon","discov","that","morti","spirit","inhabit","a","wooden","indian","in","the","cabin","the","statu","come","to","life","and","the","blood","bath","beginsbr","br","much","of","the","fx","be","not","veri","convinc","and","the","movi","take","on","a","cheap","teen","slasher","theme","stale","stori","pitifulli","act","cast","member","of","note","be","kelli","benson","phillip","rhy","emmanuel","vaugier","byron","chiefmoon","and","veteran","actress","betsi","palmer"],"filtered":["mike","hawthornegordon","curriei","wit","brutal","murder","hi","mother","suicid","hi","father","mortyjon","fedel","twenti","year","late","mike","gather","group","hi","friend","hi","famili","cabin","wood","halloween","parti","plai","game","guest","confess","confront","wrong","fearsmik","try","summon","spirit","hi","late","father","soon","discov","morti","spirit","inhabit","wooden","indian","cabin","statu","come","life","blood","bath","beginsbr","br","much","fx","veri","convinc","movi","take","cheap","teen","slasher","theme","stale","stori","pitifulli","act","cast","member","note","kelli","benson","phillip","rhy","emmanuel","vaugier","byron","chiefmoon","veteran","actress","betsi","palmer"],"filtered2":["mike","hawthornegordon","curriei","wit","brutal","murder","mother","suicid","father","mortyjon","fedel","twenti","year","late","mike","gather","group","friend","famili","cabin","wood","halloween","parti","plai","game","guest","confess","confront","wrong","fearsmik","try","summon","spirit","late","father","soon","discov","morti","spirit","inhabit","wooden","indian","cabin","statu","come","life","blood","bath","beginsbr","fx","veri","convinc","take","cheap","teen","slasher","theme","stale","stori","pitifulli","act","cast","member","note","kelli","benson","phillip","rhy","emmanuel","vaugier","byron","chiefmoon","veteran","actress","betsi","palmer"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[15,17,21,25,31,34,36,40,57,75,92,150,161,182,273,343,351,354,355,374,397,410,449,478,534,560,618,655,731,783,850,851,881,891,894,1025,1191,1327,1373,1574,1610,1690,1834,1901,2012,2018,2148,2155,2201,2209,2381,2520,2701,2877,4605,4687,7120,7667,8201],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[15,17,21,25,31,34,36,40,57,75,92,150,161,182,273,343,351,354,355,374,397,410,449,478,534,560,618,655,731,783,850,851,881,891,894,1025,1191,1327,1373,1574,1610,1690,1834,1901,2012,2018,2148,2155,2201,2209,2381,2520,2701,2877,4605,4687,7120,7667,8201],"values":[1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.6284968758320737,1.834162586674748,1.9742250248702675,2.0489535369135887,4.665424022293026,2.4323182980210873,2.7365296724240786,2.9674191958529437,6.225591251679962,3.0135689919434205,3.185521045582134,3.0316467233633775,3.4572130107926293,3.3176717946075294,3.2070272508030975,3.2597778161886266,3.3243163373261977,3.4933926673701317,3.4623020803001006,3.5642670069567886,3.7297814454343623,4.096025840389245,3.7810747398219124,3.9241755834625858,3.857614816944247,4.086456389373095,3.8767358583910254,8.182459336251505,4.436351646326448,4.3215761317340196,9.226564708971052,4.456830177669989,4.573751515728891,10.103074570833362,4.74221603786142,4.77960356993304,4.85885294158718,5.014723312293965,4.979216623837056,5.170884043049248,5.426230734858092,5.00274712124725,5.143104478942172,5.129498826886393,5.2288713006995975,5.583416318380505,5.390512652256013,6.868614562629026,6.214688095222362,6.725513718988353,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8905805373476228E-4,1.888905198354577E-4,1.8893715836395E-4,1.8889917595156226E-4,1.8891705301789577E-4,1.8888947835011625E-4,1.8894822560029475E-4,1.8886137467649932E-4,1.8889055975553808E-4,1.8908575768079316E-4,0.04817953483528622,1.8889087175389703E-4,1.8906976334612954E-4,1.8908946115349758E-4,1.8900356274854438E-4,1.8889991999807603E-4,1.8896490887621966E-4,1.8905383640476626E-4,1.8890967208646755E-4,1.8890898141396342E-4,1.8907893375984632E-4,1.8892790816528508E-4,1.8892819409130107E-4,1.8904922351525838E-4,1.8890974023094305E-4,1.890917212392765E-4,1.8895701416202964E-4,1.888900964926088E-4,1.8897573119015408E-4,1.8903340930733758E-4,1.8892883488725196E-4,1.8903002105

{"value":"I agree with most of the Columbo fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format. Columbo is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods. This movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past. And that is the disturbing point, because Columbo is no ordinary detective.<br /><br />There are two parts in this film that left me intriguing. First, I can't figure out the title of this movie. It is misleading. Maybe a better title would've been \"The Vanishing Bride\" or something similar. Second, Columbo hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason (to the viewers at least) why he does it.<br /><br />I don't feel betrayed, just disappointed.

{"value":"The secret is...this movie blows. Sorry, but it just did. <br /><br />****SPOILER****<br /><br />In this bad riff on I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and SCREAM, Beth, played admirably by Dorie Barton, joins several friends on a Spring Break trip. The group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation. Then, the deaths begin. First one then another then another of the friends is murdered, leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results. <br /><br />One note, Dorie Barton is the poor man's Reese Witherspoonshe looks like Reese, acts like Reese and could pass for Reese in a police lineup. Maybe that's how they cast her?

{"value":"I have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie. I guess I must have missed something. The beginning is intriguing, the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories. That's the best part. After the three go their separate ways, the film splits into three threads. That's when boredom sets in. Certainly, the thread with the Felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity. Unfortunately, the director beat this one to death, even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular. Bottom line: a two-hour plot-thin listlessness.

{"value":"Del - \"You are the dumbest smart person I've ever met.\"<br /><br />Calvin- \"Well,I had a brain, but they lost it in the re-writes.\"<br /><br />I think what I find most egregious about this bastardization of Asimov's work was how the character of Susan Calvin was portrayed. In the books, she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists, able to think her way through a problem. Here she's just a damsel in distress, waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith.<br /><br />There are passing references to Asimov's Laws of Robotics, but they are an afterthought to the CGI and action scenes.<br /><br />Smith is likable, as he is in most of his films, but honestly, the story isn't that good.

{"value":"Way to go ace! You just made a chilling, grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft, mellow, drama. Obviously a movie called Dahmer would be one of two kinds: Horror, or documentary right? This was neither. It wasn't close to any detailed facts, (in fact it barely had any substance at all) It wasn't really morbid or scary or didn't even try to be very disturbing.(as if you would've had to try!!) What the hell was this writer/director thinking?? Here's one of the most REAL examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot, poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parent's house.

{"value":"This had to be one of the worst films ever. When Kate shows up and Jed is with a bunch of guys and they all start clapping...so Hollywood. Another bad scene was when Kate was running her hands over the pavement it appeared that she was examining the texture of the pavement. Andie's acting is so bad in this film - I could not connect with them or feel there love for each other. The other 2 women however were very good and overshadowed Andie. Anyway this was such a campy movie. I usually like these type of films but I just couldn't get into this film. Too many unlikely situations and again Andie's acting didn't help the film. Also, she is all gums.

{"value":"I watched Written on The Wind starring Rock Hudson,Lauren Becall,Robert Stack & Dorothy Malone- Robert Stack was terrible- just bloody horrible- he was supposed to be a charming jet-setting millionaire- instead he came off like a jerk from the word go- the plot was stupid and overwrought and the 3 \"romantic\" leads had no chemistry. Somehow Dorothy Malone won an Oscar for best supporting actress- although her campy tramp character was boring- think the older sister from Splendour in The Grass filled with malice and bitterness and lacking charisma. Director Douglas Sirk has the entire cast overact their way through dialogue that felt forced and the end result was a waste of 99 minutes.

{"value":"This movie is yet another in the long line of no budget, no effort, no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video store.<br /><br />If you want to know what watching this movie is like, grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and \"attacking\" people. Congratulations, you've just made \"Hood of the Living Dead\"! Now see if a distribution company will buy it from you.<br /><br />I have seen some low budget, shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort, but this has neither.

{"value":"I have two very major complaints regarding this film.<br /><br />1. That my local rental store shelved what is very clearly a soft core porn in the \"suspense\" category. (Had I known what it was, I would not have wasted my time renting it in the first place. And yes, this movie is a soft core porn.)<br /><br />2. The title has nothing to do with the movie. No one in this movie does anything that is either deviant or obsessive, let alone a combination of the two.<br /><br />Actually, make that three major complaints:<br /><br />3. That I for some reason watched the movie long enough to discover point number two on this list. Boy do I regret that. Stay away from this movie. Learn from my mistake.

{"value":"This Italian movie is basically a soap opera with skin.<br /><br />The VHS box said it was rated \"R\" but the into on the actual tape inside said it was \"X.\" The latter makes a lot more sense because there is a short scene near the end that was shocking. Even in the dark, you could see Dutch actress Marishcka Detmers performing all sex on this guy - and, yes, you could see his penis in her mouth. I read somewhere that this was the first time where a \"mainline actress\" had done something like this on screen.<br /><br />Detmers parades around in the nude on several scenes but her face was even better than her body. She looked beautiful.

{"value":"From the start, you know how this movie will end. It's so full of clichés your typical NRA member will not even like this movie. I give it 2 out of 10, only because of the acting of William Benton. I can't believe people voted 6+ for this movie. It's so biased towards a 'certain point of view' (once a thief...). People aren't born bad. Neither are they born good. They are born with a clean slate. It's society, parents and education what makes them who they are. And if they take the wrong turn, somewhere down the line, it certainly isn't going to be the American penal system that gets them back on track! Anyway, avoid this movie like the plague.

{"value":"Deceptive Advertising... I saw a commercial for Carlitos Way: Rise to Power that states \"From the Producer of Scarface and Carlito's Way\" LETS GET IT STRAIGHT... Michael Bergman did not produce Scarface, in fact he was 'editing room assistant' for Scarface. Not to take away from Bergman's talent... but in my opinion he should of had a little more class. I think I can speak for the masses when I say... We hate being blatantly lied to. As far as the movie goes, It was poor at best. I did think Puff Daddy did a good job. Although, Luis Guzman should be ashamed for working on this film. Overall this film did not do a good job filling in the blanks for Carlito's Way.

{"value":"How can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up? With enough cops to run a mini-war that include such weapons as flamethrowers, you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying 'thanks' to a corrupt cop.<br /><br />You will never get your 90ish minutes back. Life is too precious to rent this movie.<br /><br />I feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie.<br /><br />If you like Justin Timberlake, feel free to rent this movie. He does have a very major part in it, so fans might enjoy seeing him. <br /><br />However, I believe most of his fans are young girls, who may be turned off by the violence in this

{"value":"A good deal of running around. A badly conceived adversary with very little complexity. A scientist who works in communications sending off signals into space and receiving them, gets caught up with aliens. Along with his pretty wife, he invades their territory and is given secrets about them. He becomes rather traitorous in the process. Granted, he is given little choice anyway. There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a dull movie with lots of long stretches where little happens. The plot isn't technically bad. It's just that we are usually following a car, a trip through a woods, investigating a building. This is what editing is all about. I suppose the story wouldn't technically support much more.

{"value":"so... it's really sexist, and classist, and i thought that it might not be in the beginning stages of the movie, like when stella tells steven that she would really like to change herself and begin speaking in the right way and he tells her not to change. well, he certainly changed his tune, and it seems that the other reviewers followed suit. what at the beginning appears to be a love story is really about social placement and women as sacrificial mothers. the end of the movie does not make her a hero, it makes the whole thing sad. and its sad that people think it makes her a hero. perhaps that is the comment of the movie that people should take away. positive reception reflects continual patriarchal currents in the social conscience.
