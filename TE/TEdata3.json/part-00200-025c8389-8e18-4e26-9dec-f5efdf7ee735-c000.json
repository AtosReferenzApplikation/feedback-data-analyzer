{"value":"I read this Thornton Wilder play last year in eighth grade. I was also forced to sit through this weak translation of it on screen. Let me tell you, it's not a terrific play, it is easily surpassed, but man it deserves a much better shot. The acting was really lacking, the scenery-honest to God-looked like it was designed out of cardboard by a group of three-year-olds. As if it couldn't get worse, the sound quality is lousy...there is this mind-numbing 'buzz' whenever an actor speaks...and I also couldn't help but notice that the chemistry between George and Emily, well, is non-existant. The actors all seem very uncomfortable to be there. There is no music. It is in black and white, which would be OK but it brings out the cheesiness of it all the more. In any case I think that if you're going to make a point of seeing this movie, which I don't really reccomend, then don't aim your hopes to high. The play, as stalwart as it is, is probably better.","finished_norm":["i","read","thi","thornton","wild","plai","last","year","in","grade","i","be","conjur","forc","to","sit","through","thi","weak","translat","of","it","on","screen","let","me","tell","you","it","not","a","terrif","plai","it","be","easili","surpass","but","man","it","deserv","a","much","well","shoot","the","act","be","realli","lack","the","sceneryhonest","to","godlook","like","it","be","design","out","of","cardboard","by","a","group","of","threeyearold","a","if","it","can","not","get","wrong","the","sound","qualiti","be","lousyther","be","thi","mindnumb","buzz","whenev","a","actor","speaksand","i","conjur","can","not","help","but","notic","that","the","chemistri","between","georg","and","emili","good","be","nonexist","the","actor","all","seem","veri","uncomfort","to","be","there","there","be","no","music","it","be","in","black","and","white","which","would","be","okai","but","it","bring","out","the","cheesi","of","it","all","the","much","in","ani","case","i","think","that","if","you","re","go","to","make","a","point","of","see","thi","movi","which","i","do","not","realli","reccomend","then","do","not","aim","your","hope","to","high","the","plai","a","stalwart","a","it","be","be","probabl","well"],"filtered":["read","thi","thornton","wild","plai","last","year","grade","conjur","forc","sit","thi","weak","translat","screen","let","tell","terrif","plai","easili","surpass","man","deserv","much","well","shoot","act","realli","lack","sceneryhonest","godlook","like","design","cardboard","group","threeyearold","get","wrong","sound","qualiti","lousyther","thi","mindnumb","buzz","whenev","actor","speaksand","conjur","help","notic","chemistri","georg","emili","good","nonexist","actor","seem","veri","uncomfort","music","black","white","okai","bring","cheesi","much","ani","case","think","re","go","make","point","see","thi","movi","realli","reccomend","aim","hope","high","plai","stalwart","probabl","well"],"filtered2":["read","thornton","wild","plai","last","year","grade","conjur","forc","sit","weak","translat","screen","let","tell","terrif","plai","easili","surpass","man","deserv","well","shoot","act","realli","lack","sceneryhonest","godlook","like","design","cardboard","group","threeyearold","get","wrong","sound","qualiti","lousyther","mindnumb","buzz","whenev","actor","speaksand","conjur","help","notic","chemistri","georg","emili","good","nonexist","actor","seem","veri","uncomfort","music","black","white","okai","bring","cheesi","ani","case","think","re","go","make","point","see","realli","reccomend","aim","hope","high","plai","stalwart","probabl","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,12,13,15,20,21,25,27,35,39,40,41,45,57,66,68,90,117,118,124,144,145,148,178,181,183,185,191,192,211,229,244,250,288,319,338,359,379,410,423,543,583,680,681,688,938,1107,1132,1208,1432,1484,1498,1816,2059,2359,3664,3948,4825,5670,5994,6993],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,12,13,15,20,21,25,27,35,39,40,41,45,57,66,68,90,117,118,124,144,145,148,178,181,183,185,191,192,211,229,244,250,288,319,338,359,379,410,423,543,583,680,681,688,938,1107,1132,1208,1432,1484,1498,1816,2059,2359,3664,3948,4825,5670,5994,6993],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.463169012899134,3.1077880109725475,4.885490627496221,3.1375198335242067,1.8162961064622165,1.834162586674748,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,2.0477128419653545,2.2797301185117202,2.354379525480895,2.2323930368088845,2.2931108769894046,2.34599021453259,2.3018654096236517,2.532833256045391,2.4442286541160034,2.4885128563647294,2.518833027372001,2.5460113484259455,2.5318267134339894,2.5687161421197025,2.8432628718938773,2.634508058031767,2.6812935439488212,2.8015621426949333,2.9056060024680126,2.9720957437368454,3.2189558216683714,3.1272886331425473,3.2070272508030975,3.164467636384302,3.477726550625732,3.4986697244709752,3.8095464139032247,3.706716172503366,3.6016814428070463,3.952924996748572,4.268777946167049,4.218628162481577,4.339813719283801,4.558366596889411,4.484804029712395,4.506310234933358,4.869215728622727,4.956227105612356,5.129498826886393,6.0662680901040895,5.822646007446338,6.0662680901040895,6.342521466732247,6.600350576034347,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.6833549634637533E-4,1.681863257528081E-4,1.6822785225584526E-4,1.6819403307641643E-4,1.6820995064657554E-4,1.6818539842414673E-4,1.6823770641802706E-4,1.681603751799421E-4,1.681863612972687E-4,1.6836016367693192E-4,1.6969605257281106E-4,1

{"value":"Yes I admit I cried during this movie. It was so incredibly disappointing, that I couldn't help myself but cry. TBN (Trinity Broadcasting Network) has done it again. First with having the Million Dollar Man (ex-professional wrestler) on their program, and now this.<br /><br />The Omega Code follows a stream of sketchy religiously oriented movies. It was quite amusing, yet at the same time it was disturbing to find it so biblically inaccurate. The movie follows what is known as \"the bible code\" rather than following actual biblical scripture. This film is extremely poorly made; from its writing to its directing to its hilariously horrible acting. Its depressing that people actually put effort into this movie. It appeared more like a late night movie someone would watch on the USA channel or a straight to home video rather than a theatrical released movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend you do not watch this

{"value":"Let me put it another way: balls. Or, how about bollo*ks. This is truly awful, more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise. Julia Roberts is a skilled actress, and usually her work is of the highest standard. This movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient. Normally she is the consummate professional, yet I swear that in her eyes, there were signs of bewilderment and despair.<br /><br />The one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director (Chris Walken) turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors. Unfortunately, that theme wasn't explored to it's full potential. Too little, too late.<br /><br />Zeta Jones was wooden, Cusack was Cusack, and Crystal should stick to acting. The two talented ex-Buffy stars had different experiences - Green hopelessly mis-cast, and Balfour under-used.

{"value":"I know it's a Power-Rangers gimmick and catered to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie? If they are going to write a plot with crayons, at least have the decency to make it silly. It's kind of hilarious if you watch this. We have a typical family filled with cliched characters (father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself LOLOL), air-head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting, and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space. Funny stuff!<br /><br />However, the real great moment comes near the end when war-dad and bad-acting-villain try to work a sword fight, but then they realize none of them know how to (probably because no room in budget for choreographers), so they come up with this American Gladiator type setting to run around in.

{"value":"The script was VERY weak w/o enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them. The script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced. The story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you don't have to listen to them talk this very muted, stiff dialogue. On a technical note, the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times. Then again, this could be called a blessing. Overall, this same story could have better been told in a short film w/ a running time under 30 minutes. The obvious \"in your face\" homages to Sam Raimi and \"Evil Dead\" would have been good had they been more subtle, but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off. C'mon, this kind of 35mm budget and THIS is the best that could be done?

{"value":"Wait, don't tell me... they threw out the movie and kept the out takes. You know, This movie could have been shot in a back alley in New York. The \"Gangster Bangster\" I guess. Gangster Rap, Designer gangster duster clothes including the kerchief which somehow got moved from the neck for protection from the dust storms to the head. I guess it was to protect the head from the heat filtering through the K-Mart hats. \"Budget rent-a-horsie\", it seems, supplied the horsies. The one bedroom scene where the girl was talking and the guy was mouthing her words.... I though it was him talking. You know, watching this movie just confirms that, it isn't about the acting anymore... its about looks and it's about the money. Couldn't have been too much of that where this movie is concerned. Well, all in all, I think that this movie will go down as the all time worst movie ever made. Just one more thing though, where was Ice T?

{"value":"What made the French Connection work so well was the relationship between Doyle (Hackman) and Russo (Scheider). In this catastrophe directed by Frankenheimer (who also brought us such gems as Raindeer Games and the Island of Dr. Moreau) the movie focuses on Doyle and his singular obsession of capturing Charnier (Rey). The fictitious idea that the NYPD would allow Doyle to travel to Marseilles to find Charnier with the help of the French local authorities is laugh out loud funny. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Charnier skip town with 65 pounds of pure smack!!! A street value of 32 million but yeah, let's send Doyle to find this guy, it was his pinch after all. Please!!! The story was weak. The acting was terrible (with the lone exception of Hackman, who completely overplayed his part). The direction was all over the place. Even the cuts between scenes were terrible.

{"value":"The major fault in this film is that it is impossible to believe any of these people would ever be cast in a professional production of Macbeth. Hearing David Lansbury's soft voice struggling laboriously with the famous \"Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow\" speech made it impossible to believe anyone would ever consider him for the role. I kept believing therefore that he didn't get the part because he was a lousy actor; not because a bigger name was available. Then when we see portions of the play in rehearsal it is difficult to believe the director is not parodying things with a hopelessly miscast, misdirected travesty of actors who are unable to articulate or even understand the verse and directors who see the play through their own screwball interpretations. Sometimes directors are so anxious to have their films done (and writers think they have the ability to direct their own works)that they settle for less.

{"value":"Lynne Ramsey makes arresting images, and Samantha Morton can summon feeling with a gesture. So what a drag to discover their talents wasted on this mannered, pretentious lark. <br /><br />Ramsey can't bring Callar to life. Her attempts are too arty and oblique. Repeatedly her camera lingers on long silent shots of the agonizing actress as if Morton's obliterated gaze alone could supply character. We are in a blank Warholian hell of self-indulgence: for a film that has minutes to spare on bugs crawling across the floor, you might think it could get round to fleshing out its protagonist. But how will it do so if she rarely speaks? Without the novel's interior monologue, the celluloid Morvern Callar is nobody. Small wonder Ramsey has Morton undress often.<br /><br />That said, the first ten minutes were so impressively acted, shot and edited that my hopes were soaring.

{"value":"This film concerns the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community. The plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that Eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible. But this is inconsequential, as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized. Screenplays not always need be 'chatty', but they should at least assist the development of the story. Here one line attempts such as \"he just took off\" or \"I know you don't have love in heart\" just do fully evoke something worth the audience's time. Also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music. Talk about trying to hard.

{"value":"Unlike \"The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai\", or \"Big Trouble in Little China\", or \"Conan the Barbarian\", which are horrible films that have a certain coolness and self-deprecating humor that turn them into cult sensations, The Golden Child is just plain bad.<br /><br />The premise itself is not unworkable, and there are some funny moments. But here the Eddy Murphy \"flip attitude\" just deflates any feeling of tension or danger in the story. And the special effects are silly enough to do more damage to that tension. The \"mystic secrets\" of Tibetan Buddhism are lampooned rather than drawn upon to compel.<br /><br />Without a feeling that anything is at stake, or that the characters are faced by real danger, why should we care?<br /><br />Who should see this film:<br /><br />-- big fans of Eddy Murphy who can't help themselves<br /><br />-- I can't think of anyone else<br /><br />I'll give this film a 4 out

{"value":"I consider myself to be a bit of a snob when it comes to everything and although the cinematic experience is more suited to explosions than high drama, I can be very stuck up about films, too.<br /><br />Not all art films, however, are better than King Kong. I quite possibly would give Kong two stars, double this film's haul.<br /><br />My guess is that people got so excited about this because it was almost identical in style to what you can see in a play. For the less discerning art-buff, a film that looks like a play is 'great art'.<br /><br />This film, however, was useless.<br /><br />There was hardly any story so it relied on high drama. The only drama in this film was whether the cat would drop off the roof or not. So, deep and meaningful dialogue, then? No. Great acting?

{"value":"Second movie in the boxset. Originally titled Bloodsuckers, This movie was pretty average. It is kinda boring in some parts but there is some good gore effects, but they're not great though. <br /><br />The movie takes place in the year 2210. Vampires have pretty much taken over the whole world. The V-SAN (Vampire Sanitation) Squad, which also has their own spaceship and is lead by Churchill, who is captured by the vampires, receives a message from an Earth and the team, formed by Quintana (Played by the very hot Natassia Malthe), the rookie officer Damian and the rebels Rosa and Roman (Roman being played by Aaron Pearl from Wrongfully Accused.) V-SAN later meets up with the leader of the vampires Muco, played by Michael Ironside from Total Recall. He has no plans of living peacefully with humans, as he is bent on world domination. <br /><br />While this movie was not a waste of time, I doubt I'll be putting back in the DVD player anytime

{"value":"This was just a terrible movie. It hurt me to watch it. Almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie, the acting was really poor (P.Diddy was the best actor which really says something about the movie) and the plot was generally predictable. Some links to Carlito's Way were okay, for example his dream of one day moving to the Carribien, but on the whole they were weak. The love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey that's debatable. Anyways I really wasn't expecting much before watching the movie and I guess you could say even those expectations weren't met. I feel bad for Jay Hernandez because he actually is a decent actor (Friday Night Lights). He's lucky though because I'm sure there won't be too many people watching this movie. I generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so I'm gonna go ahead and give this one two stars. Better luck next time.

{"value":"My comment is for the Russian version of Space Race named Bitva za Kosmos (Battle for Space) shown on Russia's First Channel on April 10-13, 2006. Bad translation could have ruined some details but I doubt it's the case. The number of factual errors is such that it's impossible to list them, especially in the first episode (the development of first missiles). Even the U.S. half of the film contains multiple errors and omissions. The audience is not told of any V-2/A-4 launches from the U.S. Three different Jupiter C rockets are launched with the same serial number 'UE' onboard. Apollo 1 is to be launched to the Moon, etc. In the Russian half, each and every person is ludicrous. Korolev is scared of NKVD, Glushko is saboteur and traitor, Mishin is alcoholic etc. Men as functions; no motivation, no life at all. Uniform and decorations are awful.

{"value":"I will spend a few days dedicated to Ron Howard before I swear off his work entirely. Having, unfortunately, dealt with Lucas at such a young age, Howard is now caught up in so many of Lucas' traits. How else do you explain his rampage of disasters? His only useful film, of course, has been 'Willow'. Everything else, including this, is too reliant on superficial junk.<br /><br />Some spoilers.<br /><br />He can't even have semi-intelligent focus like Peter Weir. No, poor Howard so stuck on his Spielbergian knockoff qualities that he will be quickly forgotten. <br /><br />Here we have the old adage: \"love conquers all, even disease.\" Too bad for Howard that Lynch already got through the whole subtext with more skill. Heck, even Disney did better than this. Ron even goofs up on the possibilities presented by imagined realities.<br /><br />Howard's commentary track is just awful.

{"value":"It's a bad, very bad movie.<br /><br />Well, for people a real realistic movie is a good thing. For me it is not. Life is also predictable, bad, nasty, trivial, senseless, sometimes. Maybe that's the reason for people say that this film is real.<br /><br />Too many common places: you're black, you're a criminal, you're doomed and cursed, whatever you do you'll end up by shooting or being shot by someone; don't let the kids play with the weapons, it could be dangerous; and then there are those who go to the church, and then they are good, very good...<br /><br />Before this one, I hadn't seen such a bad movie. That's perhaps the reason for I never noticed how important the photography itself is important in a movie. In this one, every scene shot in daytime, outdoor, is clearly and annoyingly blue. They didn't even care to correct the colour balance. Oh!

{"value":"The following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie: 1) Clichés abound. Seriously, awful \"twists\" are everywhere.<br /><br />2) The narrative jumps around in time, which would be fine if done well, but it's not.<br /><br />3) Lame characters that don't develop so much as either remain utterly static, or drastically change for no good reason.<br /><br />4) Big one: HORRIBLE ACTING. Over the top from nearly every person.<br /><br />The following are some of the best points from the movie: 1) The lead is damn good looking.<br /><br />As I see it, there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie: a) People who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive.<br /><br />b) People who often think to themselves, \"I like Hollywood dreck rife

{"value":"as an actor I really like independent films but this one is amateur at best.<br /><br />The boys go to Vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont? Pines yes - palms no. And the same for the wedding service - again nice grove of palm trees.<br /><br />When the boys are leaving VT they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is Federal Express. Did they ship themselves Overnight in a crate? Come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur.<br /><br />The Christian brother is far gayer than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo. The two should have switched roles.<br /><br />The minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible.<br /><br />Applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to

{"value":"To put it simply, I am not fond of westerns. And having never sat through one from beginning to end, I decided to watch \"My Darling Clementine\" and see it all the way through, no matter how painful it was for me. At first it was excruciating as expected. I found the acting to be laughable, the scenery (your standard dessert, horses and cowboys) boring and the music and its timing teetering on the edge of painful. However, after mentally pep talking myself to struggle on, after the first 20 minutes it began to be quite a bit easier for me to endure. Focusing in on the cinematography, and how John Ford managed to make even the dullest situations (dull according to me that is) look quite stunning at times, made it a lot more interesting. <br /><br />In conclusion, I can't go so far as to say that I enjoyed the movie by the end of it.

{"value":"My Score for this crap: 1 / 10 1 for the technical only. Everything else is very bad. <br /><br />Another film that makes no sense. Clearly it seems that creating a good script for film or television is almost a impossible mission. <br /><br />While it's easy to understand why politicians never say the truth, they are among the biggest liars on the planet, it is difficult to understand how to make films so pathetic. <br /><br />We must believe that taking people for morons. Perhaps it was reason to believe, since 99% of the films are crap. Because they are stupid and ridiculous and very bad scenarios. <br /><br />When you look at the price we give Oscars, we understand better why we continue to make films any more ridiculous than others. <br /><br />And oddly enough it was always money for such nonsense.

{"value":"Despite the (English) title, this seems to have little to do with Devils and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the Philospher's Stone & wants gold made from lead (& virgin's blood). Jacinto Molina plays Gilles de Lancre and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood. He's basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist that he's employed and it's more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession (unfortunately). There are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks, and the film at least has a good look to it, but otherwise there's little about this to recommend. Little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all, and most unusual, for a Molina/Naschy film, not really any unintentional humor.

{"value":"My teacher taped this and showed it to us in Child Care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people. It just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny, unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and couldn't tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such. I wouldn't be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. Stacy's (the carrier of the baby) mother is a riot. She is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window. Bobby's (the father) best friend's name is Dewey, and is an obvious rip off of Sean Penn's character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This movie is horrid, simply because none of the characters are believable.

{"value":"I first saw the live musical at the Denver Center For The Performing Arts and it was absolutely mind-blowing, Stunning and had such fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that I liked it much more than most musicals that I have seen on the stage. The interesting thing is that you NEVER got to see Zach's face. He was always in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of entire production. Whe I heard they were making a movie from it, I waited with bated breath, but when I watched the movie version I was so bummed-out disappointed that I felt I was cheated. The movie lacks the captivating mood set in the live production and it never allows you to be completely in close touch with every character. Personally, I would like to see the live version again and if that should ever be revived, I would wholeheartedly recommend that you go out of your way to see it. It will be one of the most memorable experiences you will

{"value":"\"A death at a college campus appears to be a suicide but is actually a cover for murder. The dead man's roommate finds himself embroiled in a mystery as he tries to uncover the truth behind the young man's murder. Twists and turns, as well as some false leads, makes this a tough case for our collegiate hero to solve, let alone (keep) out of the clutches of the killer,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />The stars may be bigger than the movie. Handsome Charles Starrett (as Ken Harris), who has a small \"lingerie\" scene, became one of the top western stars of the forties, peaking in \"The Return of the Durango Kid\" (1945). The man playing his father, Robert Warwick (as Joseph Harris), was one of the most respected actors of the teens, beginning with his performance in \"Alias Jimmy Valentine\" (1915).

{"value":"It was meant to be a parody on the LOTR-Trilogy. But this was one of the most awful movies I've ever seen. Bad acting, bad screenplay, bad everything. THIS IS MY PERSONAL OPINION. I don't doubt any second that there are people who'll like this sense of \"humor\", but there have been better parodies on movies from acclaimed directors as Mel Brooks or the Zucker Brothers. I'm working in a movie theater and in DVD Shop and the success for this movie was similar in both areas: At the movies it was a nice (but no big at all) success during the first two weeks but then, when the reviews of those who have seen it were not too good, the movie dropped very fast. In DVD sales it was good for short time but then nobody asked for it anymore. In the last ten years, the two worst movies I've seen are The Ring Thing and Torque. I can't decide which one was worse, but I'm happy that there a so many good movies so I don't have to think too much on this question.","finished_norm":["it","be","mean","to","be","a","parodi","on","the","lotrtrilogi","but","thi","be","on","of","the","much","aw","movi","i","have","ever","see","bad","act","bad","screenplai","bad","everyth","thi","be","my","person","opinion","i","do","not","doubt","ani","that","there","be","peopl","who","will","like","thi","sens","of","humor","but","there","have","be","well","parodi","on","movi","from","acclaim","director","a","mel","brook","or","the","zucker","brother","i","be","work","in","a","movi","theater","and","in","dvd","shop","and","the","success","for","thi","movi","be","similar","in","both","area","at","the","movi","it","be","a","nice","but","no","big","at","all","success","dure","the","two","week","but","then","when","the","review","of","that","who","have","see","it","be","not","too","good","the","movi","drop","veri","fast","in","dvd","sale","it","be","good","for","short","time","but","then","nobodi","ask","for","it","anymor","in","the","last","ten","year","the","two","wrong","movi","i","have","see","be","the","ring","thing","and","torqu","i","ca","not","decid","which","on","be","wrong","but","i","be","happi","that","there","a","so","mani","good","movi","so","i","do","not","have","to","think","too","much","on","thi","question"],"filtered":["mean","parodi","lotrtrilogi","thi","much","aw","movi","ever","see","bad","act","bad","screenplai","bad","everyth","thi","person","opinion","doubt","ani","peopl","like","thi","sens","humor","well","parodi","movi","acclaim","director","mel","brook","zucker","brother","work","movi","theater","dvd","shop","success","thi","movi","similar","area","movi","nice","big","success","dure","two","week","review","see","good","movi","drop","veri","fast","dvd","sale","good","short","time","nobodi","ask","anymor","last","ten","year","two","wrong","movi","see","ring","thing","torqu","ca","decid","wrong","happi","mani","good","movi","think","much","thi","question"],"filtered2":["mean","parodi","lotrtrilogi","aw","ever","see","bad","act","bad","screenplai","bad","everyth","person","opinion","doubt","ani","peopl","like","sens","humor","well","parodi","acclaim","director","mel","brook","zucker","brother","work","theater","dvd","shop","success","similar","area","nice","big","success","dure","two","week","review","see","good","drop","veri","fast","dvd","sale","good","short","time","nobodi","ask","anymor","last","ten","year","two","wrong","see","ring","thing","torqu","ca","decid","wrong","happi","mani","good","think","question"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,9,12,15,20,21,23,25,27,29,44,47,48,50,57,58,81,82,88,138,144,153,173,176,193,239,247,249,262,272,306,369,378,381,424,532,538,542,545,567,589,605,703,857,866,904,1084,1157,1294,1352,1433,2358,3084,3338,3342],"values":[1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,9,12,15,20,21,23,25,27,29,44,47,48,50,57,58,81,82,88,138,144,153,173,176,193,239,247,249,262,272,306,369,378,381,424,532,538,542,545,567,589,605,703,857,866,904,1084,1157,1294,1352,1433,2358,3084,3338,3342],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,2.0358433949768115,0.9418936859054116,3.205071257016622,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.604729392502474,3.412938870621443,1.6955116224012472,1.717994385570355,1.834162586674748,1.865701314626681,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,2.0317223413467334,2.2907365189289424,2.2931108769894046,2.3409902041158843,2.4368824319140248,2.5040471493269134,2.517840471459249,2.6593400337329487,5.460751613699401,2.6754694156628323,2.726701583487816,2.8028805344481915,2.8739486825973213,3.121829110937649,3.130944944345658,3.24941502915308,3.212973749990824,6.889205006401399,3.43462735814388,3.4471119148061256,3.442099372982581,3.454678155189441,3.530930586689197,3.5474598886404074,3.6746621462132825,3.9612932464190886,3.8962296530720266,3.9121030022283168,4.224077767249142,4.2860694432771105,9.210500365576523,4.436351646326448,4.520909034354511,5.390512652256013,5.463272006538442,5.583416318380505,5.7959777603641776]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.7555127883707311E-4,1.753957139738447E-4,1.7543902053052487E-4,1.7540375167560826E-4,1.7542035156011308E-4,1.7539474689479164E-4,1.7544929709613593E-4,1.7536865101711803E-4,1.7539575104193582E-4,1.7557700354468796E-4,1.769701559643211E-4,1.7539604075036044E-4,1.7556215188484656E-4,1.7558044243214373E-4,1.7550068082166636E-4,1.7540444256559907E-4,1.754647884775712E-4,1.7554736280356146E-4,1.7541349794067906E-4,1.7541285661152665E-4,1.7557066714152906E-4,1.7543043118892822E-4,1.7543069668768253E-4,1.7554307947028765E-4,1.754135612167447E-4,1.7558254105180544E-4,1.7545745778128647E-4,1.7539532087565584E-

{"value":"Did the movie-makers even preview this before they released it? The script jumps from place to place without giving much explanation. The beginning doesn't clarify if its a prequel or not. It starts with Superman's beginnings on Earth and then jumps to a point after the last movie - but doesn't really alert the viewer of this. VERY confusing! Superman himself is weak and in need of Prozac. He is portrayed as a potential home-wrecker, a stalker, and someone who is clearly depressed and confused. This type of character rarely makes for an interesting hero. The ending is absolutely ridiculous. Superman ending up in a hospital just made me want to kill him off myself. I'm seriously waiting for a SNL skit where Superman appears on Maury Povich and Maury says, \"The results are in - in the case of the child, Superman, you ARE the father.\" To sum up - OK acting by this Superman and Kevin Spacey, but HORRIBLE script.

{"value":"I haven't seen the first two - only this one which is called Primal Species in England. I don't think I'll be bothering to look them out though.<br /><br />This is an awful film. Terrible acting, bad dialogue, cheap rubber monsters. Everything about it is so nasty. The most sympathetic characters die really quickly and leave you with the annoying ones, especially one called Polchak, who is an incredible jerk. No-one like that would survive 5 minutes in the army. He lasted for ages but I was pleased when he finally got his head got chewed off - I was having nightmares he was going to survive. The Colonel was rubbish too - all moody pouts and clueless shouting. And the specky Doctor looked and acted like she was out of a porno. I was waiting for her to take her glasses off, shake her hair and turn into a vamp, but she didn't.

{"value":"This is one of the worst things to ever come out of England, so that says a lot right there. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is amazing though. The upside is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This movie has several views of London too although none of them are good. There is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate back to just below normal. There is also a watch that gets teleported away, and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of \"The Sixth Sense\" only a lot more dull and British. Add on a furious gun fight between the British police and the Dr. Rat, which results in nothing, plus the electrocuting of a lot of people, plus a cat and you have yourself... ummm... A British movie.

{"value":"While some scenes of training were realistic, too many of them depicted military instructors as ex-Nazi types. Obviously, the people who wrote the screen play were either anti-military types or writing a film for that audience.<br /><br />I am a Viet Nam vet and, even during this period, military instructors who behaved in the manner some of these did would probably still be serving time in military prison.<br /><br />And I really loved the scene where the \"hero\" and his buddy (both privates) are sitting down in the Captain's office, smoking cigarettes and talking and cussing with the Captain as if he were their buddy. This sort of thing never happened in training or in a formal situation, as was the purpose for the scene.<br /><br />At the end I asked myself, \"What was this film about?\" as it seemed to wander

{"value":"What is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is, in fact, a head-ache inducing tale about a bunch of characters (the only big actor being Ginger Rogers, in a very early role) all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building. These characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean. As a cheap, low budget production, most of the action revolves around Rogers and her lead man (some guy, I don't care who he is 'cause he really sucked) talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime, while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt. Honestly, I've never had a worse time watching an old b-rate movie of this type, and I've seen some real head-slappers.<br /><br />Oh, and the butler didn't do it, because there wasn't a butler. But pay attention to the guy who's closest to a butler.
