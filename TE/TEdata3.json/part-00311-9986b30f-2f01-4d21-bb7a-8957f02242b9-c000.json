{"value":"This film takes what could have been a good idea, a mummified 2000 year old witch and completely destroys it. Nora and Jim are alcoholics who go to Ireland to dry-out. They go to stay with her Nan and Uncle. The uncle has discovered a 2000 year old witch preserved in the peat. He revives her and she takes the form of Nora. She cannot be killed conventionally,(more is the pity). Nora, however, works out a way to do so.<br /><br />This is a Gothic horror movie that has been done on the cheap. It is a sprawling mess.

{"value":"I watched this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, I found it strange and completely pointless... so I decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it. Wow. what a difference. The original one was way better. I'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement, it's existence did have a purpose. It was really the Christian public expressing their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but I don't want to go into details, just, simply put, if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it SHOULD look like, feel free to watch the 70s version, a little dated, but A lot

{"value":"This movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in Ask the Dust. Colin Farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile. Donald Sutherland comes across as an amateur. Why? Because the script is awful, the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted. The atmosphere of the movie is bad - I could only think when it would finish and I turned it off half way. The director has done a very poor job and even though I have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance. The atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience. In one word, it is a TERRIBLE

{"value":"as an inspiring director myself, this movie was exciting to watch with criticism in mind. Shot with low end digital camera probably with 35mm adapter for DOF. The editing is good acting decent, sound effects aren't too over the top. I would have give it a 7 for an indie film, but the story aren't that interesting. It's more on the drama side, character developments than a horror flick.<br /><br />It's not for those who wants to get spooked startled frightened grossed out, or sit down with popcorn to just enjoy.<br /><br />honestly this movie would be good if we were still in the 50's<br /><br />This movie is about a family who has a dry field, and that is just that.","finished_norm":["a","a","inspir","director","myself","thi","movi","be","excit","to","watch","with","critic","in","mind","shoot","with","low","end","digit","camera","probabl","with","mm","adapt","for","dof","the","edit","be","good","act","decent","sound","effect","be","not","too","over","the","top","i","would","have","give","it","a","for","a","indi","film","but","the","stori","be","not","that","interest","it","much","on","the","drama","side","charact","develop","than","a","horror","flickbr","br","it","not","for","that","who","want","to","get","spook","startl","frighten","gross","out","or","sit","down","with","popcorn","to","just","enjoybr","br","honestli","thi","movi","would","be","good","if","we","be","still","in","the","sbr","br","thi","movi","be","about","a","famili","who","have","a","spindri","field","and","that","be","just","that"],"filtered":["inspir","director","thi","movi","excit","watch","critic","mind","shoot","low","end","digit","camera","probabl","mm","adapt","dof","edit","good","act","decent","sound","effect","top","give","indi","film","stori","interest","much","drama","side","charact","develop","horror","flickbr","br","want","get","spook","startl","frighten","gross","sit","popcorn","enjoybr","br","honestli","thi","movi","good","still","sbr","br","thi","movi","famili","spindri","field"],"filtered2":["inspir","director","excit","watch","critic","mind","shoot","low","end","digit","camera","probabl","mm","adapt","dof","edit","good","act","decent","sound","effect","top","give","indi","stori","interest","drama","side","charact","develop","horror","flickbr","want","get","spook","startl","frighten","gross","sit","popcorn","enjoybr","honestli","good","still","sbr","famili","spindri","field"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,10,17,21,24,30,37,58,60,64,83,106,117,148,178,182,217,231,238,244,309,320,348,364,425,463,524,579,701,757,909,1282,1447,1655,1708,2072,2420,2765,3142,4025,4474,4871],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,10,17,21,24,30,37,58,60,64,83,106,117,148,178,182,217,231,238,244,309,320,348,364,425,463,524,579,701,757,909,1282,1447,1655,1708,2072,2420,2765,3142,4025,4474,4871],"values":[1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.4876543214774305,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,1.883428577602134,2.292318797740072,2.159084361316692,2.2797301185117202,2.3018654096236517,2.532833256045391,2.7365296724240786,2.6113665294700725,2.7049353070058615,2.597304642813496,2.634508058031767,2.848772527704847,2.938298364153555,3.0103169565570433,2.9878441007049847,3.226987993365636,3.3467891931782563,3.4028786598293,3.5642670069567886,3.8240921249056035,3.7165362186843414,3.9612932464190886,4.449957298382227,4.477736862489302,4.760735085628657,4.688631791727313,5.064116067623542,5.2288713006995975,5.3560264761848435,5.770002273960917,5.7959777603641776,5.999576715605417,6.0662680901040895]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.038801917264485E-5,8.977851162836983E-5,9.047645394805737E-5,8.995368003326756E-5,8.995515382303836E-5,8.982941449446829E-5,9.009657975944057E-5,8.979143914741394E-5,8.999332303547922E-5,9.984267936592338E-5,0.8562312750293113,8.964649596780441E-5,9.131970335960843E-5,9.26223989942622E-5,8.971186525748088E-5,8.946394036893443E-5,9.169550645123045E-5,9.010502112888653E-5,8.98254706518432E-5,8.989991999631684E-5,9.07697544496444E-5,9.019429240397356E-5,9.029699228892941E-5,9.039427717049012E-5,9.108800680799436E-5,9.061164217562496E-5,9.442078347586889E-5,8.967314704909017E-5,8.967554601577725E-5,8.99027385044916E-5,9.18136001649457E-5,9.009980031234258E-5,9.671450312615087E-5,9.035323775490082E-5,8.977075223694578E-5,9.018510343600843E-5,8.968079969984966E-5,8.973379445423547E-5,8.946349089486456E-5,8.948670185187252E-5,8.968812554215352E-5,9.063414522297348E-5,9.017359504376066E-5,8.981707385599671E-5,9.090844548230051E-5,8.985154613974576E-5,9.283686683259757E-5,9.147167364542985E-5,8.95089441893368E-5,8.970676442984284E-5,8.967565074422092E-5,9.219946065071868E-5,8.970809909547922E-5,8.947875747761737E-5,9.046091489490164E-5,8.973120552037544E-5,9.649604982259544E-5,8.965725534758117E-5,8.95079090697469E-5,8.993528306498413E-5,9.082736548781463E-5,8.992933333444902E-5,8.949134990646294E-5,8.969971680846592E-5,8.946457297162342E-5,9.15345977577423E-5,9.023526827126057E-5,9.004305393823688E-5,8.996430721802911E-5,9.029224141847722E-5,8.946130916211517E-5,8.99661932775866E-5,9.142538520897709E-5,0.06266116261683968,0.07413564915247377,8.985857927879264E-5,9.056185757812322E-5,9.000838334412792E-5,8.943326040684996E-5,8.954411907545262E-5]}}
{"value":"A friend and I went through a phase some (alot of) years ago of selecting the crappest horror films in the video shop for an evening's entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this one (probably v. v. cheap).<br /><br />The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There's also a few very amusing scenes. Among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at the time (doesn't seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go).<br /><br />Apart from that it's total crap, mind you.

{"value":"there was some truth to this movie. I remember a story reported 15 to 20 years ago of 4 fisherman finding a body in the water and they chose not to report it until their trip was finished. I also recall they were charged with interfering with a corpse (or some such charge). I'm not sure if it was in Australia. The viewers outside of Australia must think we live in a country full of rapists and serial murders. Wolf Creek and this film would encourage this perception. The film itself reminded me of A Simple Plan. But as far a being one of the best Australian films ever, as someone claimed, I can't be that generous. Put it this way, I wouldn't bother watching it again.","finished_norm":["there","be","some","truth","to","thi","movi","i","rememb","a","stori","report","to","year","ago","of","fisherman","find","a","bodi","in","the","water","and","thei","choos","not","to","report","it","until","their","trip","be","finish","i","conjur","recal","thei","be","charg","with","interfer","with","a","corps","or","some","such","charg","i","be","not","sure","if","it","be","in","australia","the","viewer","outsid","of","australia","must","think","we","live","in","a","countri","full","of","rapist","and","serial","murder","wolf","creek","and","thi","film","would","encourag","thi","percept","the","film","itself","remind","me","of","a","simpl","plan","but","a","far","a","be","on","of","the","well","australian","film","ever","a","someon","claim","i","ca","not","be","that","gener","put","it","thi","wai","i","would","not","bother","watch","it","again"],"filtered":["truth","thi","movi","rememb","stori","report","year","ago","fisherman","find","bodi","water","thei","choos","report","trip","finish","conjur","recal","thei","charg","interfer","corps","charg","sure","australia","viewer","outsid","australia","must","think","live","countri","full","rapist","serial","murder","wolf","creek","thi","film","encourag","thi","percept","film","remind","simpl","plan","far","well","australian","film","ever","someon","claim","ca","gener","put","thi","wai","bother","watch"],"filtered2":["truth","rememb","stori","report","year","ago","fisherman","find","bodi","water","choos","report","trip","finish","conjur","recal","charg","interfer","corps","charg","sure","australia","viewer","outsid","australia","must","think","live","countri","full","rapist","serial","murder","wolf","creek","encourag","percept","remind","simpl","plan","far","well","australian","ever","someon","claim","ca","gener","put","wai","bother","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,12,17,20,33,38,39,44,57,81,101,116,119,139,141,159,225,273,279,290,336,376,496,573,581,584,608,610,644,737,751,758,791,830,990,1043,1133,1522,1575,1700,1857,2118,2256,2861,3550,3870,4776,5841,5980],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[7,12,17,20,33,38,39,44,57,81,101,116,119,139,141,159,225,273,279,290,336,376,496,573,581,584,608,610,644,737,751,758,791,830,990,1043,1133,1522,1575,1700,1857,2118,2256,2861,3550,3870,4776,5841,5980],"values":[0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.604729392502474,1.834162586674748,1.949757232424728,2.098582041218749,2.2466628996789315,2.1653408989309972,2.2939035841256437,2.2657547357741192,2.300267965194495,2.641219492619754,2.9674191958529437,2.7910771187233068,2.8612813773965557,2.9233055795674137,3.1569204307489187,3.293679367864308,3.4623020803001006,3.530930586689197,3.5146700658174166,3.616452760127359,3.477726550625732,3.5670958631572662,3.6841709341823097,3.8023521382691974,3.8240921249056035,3.8240921249056035,3.9571003681590526,8.470133777649474,4.115443926246347,4.403125998698128,9.101523995008385,4.715065048795469,4.6973654716960676,5.143104478942172,5.274680836730892,5.064116067623542,5.695894301807195,11.43998370677251,5.999576715605417,6.137727054086234,6.389041482367141,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.759806150243296E-5,6.714223197058535E-5,6.766419880073874E-5,6.727323433921721E-5,6.727433653542066E-5,6.718030045692535E-5,6.738010408331543E-5,6.715190001326863E-5,6.730288196426945E-5,7.46688736197901E-5,0.35851254274064076,6.704350204128863E-5,6.829483576021279E-5,6.92690765991682E-5,6.709238946358604E-5,6.690697504674906E-5,6.857588584553159E-5,6.738641709046168E-5,6.7177350993946E-5,6.723302907399035E-5,6.788354806324558E-5,6.745317997783292E-5,6.752998565631869E-5,6.760274164176004E-5,6.81215579531619E-5,0.4373152548297891,7.0614025917733E-5,6.706343345972607E-5,6.706522756362546E-5,6.723513693840299E-5,6.866420403411284E-5,6.738251262302163E-5,7.232941921220212E-5,6.75720496876225E-5,6.713642899112518E-5,6.744630786770887E-5,6.706915661154897E-5,6.710878954851417E-5,6.690663890069678E-5,6.692399756961901E-5,6.707463535467386E-5,6.778213063061782E-5,6.743770114068819E-5,6.717107132184731E-5,6.798727027157739E-5,6.719685194607525E-5,6.942946964969404E-5,6.840848906096581E-5,6.694063184161247E-5,6.708857473168303E-5,6.706530588639257E-5,6.895277569535059E-5,6.708957288177635E-5,6.691805624792158E-5,6.765257768235904E-5,6.71068533747613E-5,7.216604557060317E-5,6.7051548607886E-5,6.693985771160784E-5,6.72594758853329E-5,6.792663335858778E-5,6.725502628842485E-5,6.692747368827882E-5,6.70833040603303E-5,6.690744814833783E-5,0.1106819159900773,0.08834423063550975,6.73400739799144E-5,6.728118204175219E-5,6.752643264524536E-5,6.69050072585176E-5,6.728259256021616E-5,6.8373871546

{"value":"Considering that I felt like picking up a new Jet Li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting, I grabbed this title.<br /><br />Unfortunatly, this movie contains more gun battles (ala Chow Yun Fat but nowhere near as good), than Jet Li and company's acrobatic fighting. Thus it was a let down.<br /><br />The faucet fighting was interesting and even funny, considering this was something totaly unexpected in a Jet Li film for me, more on the line of say Jackie Chan.<br /><br />But alas I'd recommend Fist of Legend, Tai Chi Master, or even the Enforcer over this dissapointment.<br /><br />Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for overall movie

{"value":"The next time you are at a party and someone asks, \"The other day I heard the expression 'Author's will'. Does anyone know what it means?\" Tell them to sit through 'Head Above Water'. The only way Diaz could possibly have survived this movie was by means of this literary device commonly used by bad writers. There are some comic scenes and you will have a few laughs. However the film does not stand up to the most minor logical analysis. Why does Keitel tie Diaz's hand in front of her instead of behind? Why so she can do the chainsaw gag of course. For me the best part of this movie was that I saw it on a cable channel instead of spending four bucks at the video shop.","finished_norm":["the","next","time","you","be","at","a","parti","and","someon","ask","the","other","dai","i","hear","the","express","author","will","doe","anyon","know","what","it","mean","tell","them","to","sit","through","head","abov","water","the","onli","wai","diaz","can","possibli","have","surviv","thi","movi","be","by","mean","of","thi","literari","devic","commonli","us","by","bad","writer","there","be","some","comic","scene","and","you","will","have","a","few","laugh","howev","the","film","doe","not","stand","up","to","the","much","minor","logic","analysi","why","doe","keitel","tie","diaz","hand","in","front","of","her","instead","of","behind","why","so","she","can","do","the","chainsaw","gag","of","cours","for","me","the","well","part","of","thi","movi","be","that","i","see","it","on","a","cabl","channel","instead","of","spend","four","buck","at","the","video","shop"],"filtered":["next","time","parti","someon","ask","dai","hear","express","author","doe","anyon","know","mean","tell","sit","head","abov","water","onli","wai","diaz","possibli","surviv","thi","movi","mean","thi","literari","devic","commonli","us","bad","writer","comic","scene","laugh","howev","film","doe","stand","much","minor","logic","analysi","doe","keitel","tie","diaz","hand","front","instead","behind","chainsaw","gag","cours","well","part","thi","movi","see","cabl","channel","instead","spend","four","buck","video","shop"],"filtered2":["next","time","parti","someon","ask","dai","hear","express","author","doe","anyon","know","mean","tell","sit","head","abov","water","onli","wai","diaz","possibli","surviv","mean","literari","devic","commonli","us","bad","writer","comic","scene","laugh","howev","doe","stand","minor","logic","analysi","doe","keitel","tie","diaz","hand","front","instead","behind","chainsaw","gag","cours","well","part","see","cabl","channel","instead","spend","four","buck","video","shop"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,9,11,18,19,20,26,33,56,61,88,90,113,132,133,139,152,158,199,208,216,235,240,244,283,287,297,306,377,393,480,558,606,704,728,773,830,846,850,885,973,998,1097,1112,1175,1407,1431,1535,1554,3281,3803,3942,4700,7232,7505],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,9,11,18,19,20,26,33,56,61,88,90,113,132,133,139,152,158,199,208,216,235,240,244,283,287,297,306,377,393,480,558,606,704,728,773,830,846,850,885,973,998,1097,1112,1175,1407,1431,1535,1554,3281,3803,3942,4700,7232,7505],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,3.6459479802144523,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,1.8610609350701788,1.8818517047392527,4.063444682693467,2.0477128419653545,2.1521782565202803,2.253494045787767,2.3212364753796515,2.2939035841256437,4.6262390953961505,2.3106972614914807,2.558331832813986,2.6289494000279396,2.6070186965339692,2.6457189377809835,2.7666071276613566,2.634508058031767,2.7678802023081546,2.841890188081905,2.813490713560207,2.8739486825973213,3.0602441305135506,3.120015873813468,3.43462735814388,3.4572130107926293,3.584239140143704,3.5900195030592035,3.7740817043309423,3.7364704335851586,3.9571003681590526,3.9201351739255808,3.9241755834625858,3.9782428047328615,4.072271754381138,4.135246553542527,4.186539847930077,4.2574141875167335,4.263079925052412,4.443131333311827,4.520909034354511,4.558366596889411,4.637773374493822,5.583416318380505,5.7959777603641776,5.822646007446338,6.255510089742618,6.725513718988353,13.897314540605125]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.398989038723723E-5,6.355839159674093E-5,6.405249748535561E-5,6.368240147251111E-5,6.368344483696087E-5,6.359442810746272E-5,6.378356684705829E-5,6.356754358982789E-5,6.371046660093593E-5,7.068328487639943E-5,0.3847474976820378,6.346493155937863E-5,6.464947303486057E-5,6.55717119735213E-5,6.351120952541192E-5,6.33356919447904E-5,6.491552155390319E-5,6.37895428858133E-5,6.359163607750571E-5,6.36443422374136E-5,6.426013857671781E-5,6.385274218102783E-5,6.392544821487236E-5,6.399432071550228E-5,6.448544425011016E-5,6.414820353072398E-5,6.684487214348052E-5,6.348379910162358E-5,6.348549744192083E-5,6.364633759067844E-5,6.499912559639943E-5,0.6102520810122394,6.846870315940587E-5,6.396526700098178E-5,6.355289836200427E-5,6.384623688244686E-5,6.348921676967022E-5,6.352673422558182E-5,6.333537374115317E-5,6.335180585912983E-5,6.349440307478355E-5,6.41641344864678E-5,6.383808955534302E-5,6.358569159447866E-5,6.435832442102098E-5,6.361009613037502E-5,6.572354374937264E-5,6.475705988122407E-5,6.336755224619886E-5,6.350759841185474E-5,6.348557158406589E-5,6.527229421338413E-5,6.350854328384726E-5,6.334618166642779E-5,6.404149666558703E-5,6.352490139867136E-5,6.831404988702314E-5,6.347254862565413E-5,6.336681943680

{"value":"From everything I'd read about the movie, I was excited to support a film with a Christian theme. Everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done. Especially the writing! Without good writing a movie doesn't have a chance. The writer/director said in an interview that he didn't want to give away how the title relates to the story. Believe me, it was NO big surprise. I kept waiting for the teenage/young adult back-story to unfold, but it never did. As someone who has gone through a divorce, I was very disappointed. This movie would have been NO comfort to me when I first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian!","finished_norm":["from","everyth","i","have","read","about","the","movi","i","be","excit","to","support","a","film","with","a","christian","theme","everyth","about","the","movi","be","veri","unprofession","do","especi","the","write","without","good","write","a","movi","doe","not","have","a","chanc","the","writerdirector","sai","in","a","interview","that","he","do","not","want","to","give","awai","how","the","titl","relat","to","the","stori","believ","me","it","be","no","big","surpris","i","keep","wait","for","the","teenageyoung","adult","backstori","to","unfold","but","it","never","do","a","someon","who","have","go","through","a","divorc","i","be","veri","disappoint","thi","movi","would","have","be","no","comfort","to","me","when","i","go","through","the","emot","turmoil","that","divorc","can","bring","to","your","life","a","a","christian"],"filtered":["everyth","read","movi","excit","support","film","christian","theme","everyth","movi","veri","unprofession","especi","write","without","good","write","movi","doe","chanc","writerdirector","sai","interview","want","give","awai","titl","relat","stori","believ","big","surpris","keep","wait","teenageyoung","adult","backstori","unfold","never","someon","go","divorc","veri","disappoint","thi","movi","comfort","go","emot","turmoil","divorc","bring","life","christian"],"filtered2":["everyth","read","excit","support","christian","theme","everyth","veri","unprofession","especi","write","without","good","write","doe","chanc","writerdirector","interview","want","give","awai","titl","relat","stori","believ","big","surpris","keep","wait","teenageyoung","adult","backstori","unfold","never","someon","go","divorc","veri","disappoint","comfort","go","emot","turmoil","divorc","bring","life","christian"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,15,17,18,30,37,42,65,75,82,91,125,134,139,145,155,187,193,250,264,267,326,331,458,486,506,524,533,684,734,903,1091,2189,2458,2711,2785,5027,5833,7558],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,15,17,18,30,37,42,65,75,82,91,125,134,139,145,155,187,193,250,264,267,326,331,458,486,506,524,533,684,734,903,1091,2189,2458,2711,2785,5027,5833,7558],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.3364419891718522,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,3.8147700134888347,1.9742250248702675,2.020196584395323,2.0105926690411424,2.2242236634876535,2.2443961816702407,2.2939035841256437,2.34599021453259,2.3074766467914385,2.4732161909892554,5.035680942918498,2.6812935439488212,2.757740698455715,2.7085302779237206,2.942840385588056,2.932274249550174,3.2850956241729166,3.3066947359763783,3.449627639403373,3.4028786598293,3.4933926673701317,8.260518024062975,3.79165684915245,3.948766986599908,4.364659717870332,5.02684467282631,5.129498826886393,5.373120909544144,10.852461469716184,6.1754673820690815,6.342521466732247,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.909964912139965E-5,8.84988293575765E-5,8.918682336784856E-5,8.867150095229009E-5,8.867295373500023E-5,8.854900666592069E-5,8.881236381860914E-5,8.851157261073532E-5,8.871057889225944E-5,0.07018612226720534,0.6048353958802697,8.836869541789538E-5,9.001805329609291E-5,9.13021806065712E-5,8.843313294874075E-5,8.818874192457462E-5,9.038849977681844E-5,8.88206848667151E-5,8.854511903792195E-5,8.86185071985503E-5,8.947594323149575E-5,8.890868368956442E-5,8.900991971396382E-5,8.910581791918192E-5,8.97896592938743E-5,8.932008465349096E-5,9.307493132910304E-5,8.839496662079376E-5,8.839733139316106E-5,8.862128553235732E-5,9.05049102098801E-5,8.881553846649026E-5,9.533595682665963E-5,8.906536346999026E-5,8.849118056673446E-5,8.889962569903676E-5,8.840251019242815E-5,8.845474957176482E-5,8.818829885720483E-5,8.821117897056622E-5,8.840973161385953E-5,8.934226694757449E-5,8.88882813447671E-5,8.853684192807361E-5,8.961265739404799E-5,0.17786718550915,9.151359146963048E-5,0.04308463191033196,8.823310427086428E-5,8.842810482712753E-5,8.839743462882955E-5,9.088527072897187E-5,8.842942046874668E-5,8.820334783359582E-5,8.917150580478514E-5,8.845219753997303E-5,9.512061730628555E-5,8.837930143594565E-5,8.82320839056311E-5,8.865336621016436E-5,8.953273309516875E-5,8.864750128572087E-5,8.821576077285477E-5,8.842115766092595E-5,8.818936551029027E-5,9.022988463886536E-5,8.894907549625669E-5,8.875960094215896E-5,8.868197665960252E-5,8.900523656132715E-5,8.818614822237262E-5,8.868383583570056E-5,9.012222878066972E-5,8.834418269836722E-5,0.09734294132241983,8.857775574211229E-5,8.927100967419992E-5,8.872542453473E-5,8.815849926761846E-5,8.82677777822377E-5]}}

{"value":"\"Scary Movie 2\" is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny. Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies.<br /><br />This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.<br /><br />This movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things. It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch - but I don't think you will like it nearly as much.","finished_norm":["scari","movi","be","a","let","down","to","the","scari","movi","franchis","scari","movi","and","be","all","good","but","thi","on","be","kind","of","bore","and","not","veri","funni","luckili","thei","pick","their","act","up","after","thi","on","and","make","two","much","great","scari","moviesbr","br","thi","film","be","about","a","group","of","teen","who","get","trick","by","their","professor","into","go","to","a","haunt","mansion","for","a","night","thing","start","to","go","wrong","and","then","thei","realiz","thei","have","to","escapebr","br","thi","movi","be","not","horribl","but","thei","can","have","improv","quit","a","few","thing","it","be","a","bite","of","fun","and","if","you","like","the","other","movi","in","the","scari","movi","franchis","then","give","thi","a","watch","but","i","do","not","think","you","will","like","it","nearli","a","much"],"filtered":["scari","movi","let","scari","movi","franchis","scari","movi","good","thi","kind","bore","veri","funni","luckili","thei","pick","act","thi","make","two","much","great","scari","moviesbr","br","thi","film","group","teen","get","trick","professor","go","haunt","mansion","night","thing","start","go","wrong","thei","realiz","thei","escapebr","br","thi","movi","horribl","thei","improv","quit","thing","bite","fun","like","movi","scari","movi","franchis","give","thi","watch","think","like","nearli","much"],"filtered2":["scari","let","scari","franchis","scari","good","kind","bore","veri","funni","luckili","pick","act","make","two","great","scari","moviesbr","group","teen","get","trick","professor","go","haunt","mansion","night","thing","start","go","wrong","realiz","escapebr","horribl","improv","quit","thing","bite","fun","like","scari","franchis","give","watch","think","like","nearli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,7,12,15,21,25,29,30,47,51,62,71,108,120,122,124,154,210,230,259,396,405,410,446,611,881,1116,1262,1436,1752,2005,2115,2531,2938],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,7,12,15,21,25,29,30,47,51,62,71,108,120,122,124,154,210,230,259,396,405,410,446,611,881,1116,1262,1436,1752,2005,2115,2531,2938],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,2.6390769554676132,1.3364419891718522,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,2.0226120445069267,1.9214926742550966,2.138507503627933,2.2044500422972613,2.2489347673732487,2.2323930368088845,2.348499626138016,2.687151791517189,2.7121382192999195,2.7464553122240485,16.457632572516033,3.109204957709252,3.2070272508030975,3.233054746047873,3.520060914452293,4.086456389373095,4.181290492043933,4.528289141652134,4.4919214974812585,5.0768550934009715,10.103074570833362,5.116075806554253,5.156897801074508,5.3560264761848435]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0276228773621418E-4,1.0206933760614718E-4,1.0286282937790533E-4,1.0226848685392538E-4,1.0227016240794101E-4,1.0212720915837819E-4,1.0243094978776144E-4,1.0208403492382144E-4,1.0231355704837472E-4,1.1351130646815537E-4,0.723051192707582,1.0191924878441077E-4,1.0382152102151454E-4,1.0530255783221516E-4,1.0199356723741298E-4,1.0171170102364945E-4,1.0424877217478583E-4,1.0244054679457532E-4,1.021227253972079E-4,1.0220736697945078E-4,1.0319628320080296E-4,1.0254203945412293E-4,1.0265879912232798E-4,0.13245292431731728,1.0355810483071411E-4,1.0301652509628716E-4,1.073471441087019E-4,1.0194954844258049E-4,1.0195227583175468E-4,1.022105713460327E-4,1.0438303311223891E-4,1.0243461123965534E-4,1.099548777535589E-4,1.0272274468514612E-4,1.0206051594126864E-4,1.0253159250132239E-4,1.0195824875382184E-4,1.0201849857728907E-4,1.0171119001583978E-4,1.0173757859105714E-4,1.0196657751599221E-4,1.0304210884784778E-4,1.0251850859123816E-4,1.0211317906619261E-4,1.0335396126405399E-4,1.0215237066231308E-4,1.0554638667053815E-4,1.03994296289541E-4,1.0176286594112136E-4,1.0198776809807758E-4,1.0195239489769461E-4,1.0482171853347045E-4,1.0198928548163586E-4,1.0172854661889351E-4,1.0284516300280216E-4,1.0201555521412337E-4,0.1365756756009455,1.0193148114098416E-4,1.0176168911195625E-4,1.0224757131041065E-4,1.0326178128490107E-4,1.0224080705197466E-4,1.0174286297196963E-4,1.019797556457369E-4,1.0171242023068756E-4,1.040658348163744E-4,1.0258862498506976E-4,1.0237009619355506E-4,1.0228056891776846E-4,1.0265339784989304E-4,1.0170870960028684E-4,1.0228271318198299E-4,1.0394167088996751E-4,1.0189097725739368E-4,1.0441272585594744E-4,1.0216036664966893E-4,1.0295992490546393E-4,1.0233067913806006E-4,1.0167682092426992E-4,1.0180285632702879E-4]}}
{"value":"The creativeness of this movie was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left out a good story line, only to substitute with horrible special affects. This movie seemed to be focused on amusing children, but couldn't even accomplish that. Many small low budget films have the potential to become great movies, but this movie is no where near that. Fortunately this will be another film easily made, and easily forgotten. This movie was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on the side until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie. Anyone who has a shred of respect for films, should avoid seeing this movie at all costs.","finished_norm":["the","creativ","of","thi","movi","be","lose","from","the","begin","when","the","writer","and","director","leav","out","a","good","stori","line","onli","to","substitut","with","horribl","special","affect","thi","movi","seem","to","be","focu","on","amus","child","but","can","not","even","accomplish","that","mani","small","low","budget","film","have","the","potenti","to","becom","great","movi","but","thi","movi","be","no","where","near","that","fortun","thi","will","be","anoth","film","easili","make","and","easili","forget","thi","movi","be","probabl","a","chanc","for","the","actor","to","make","a","littl","monei","on","the","side","until","their","chanc","come","along","for","a","real","role","in","a","good","movi","anyon","who","have","a","shred","of","respect","for","film","should","avoid","see","thi","movi","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["creativ","thi","movi","lose","begin","writer","director","leav","good","stori","line","onli","substitut","horribl","special","affect","thi","movi","seem","focu","amus","child","even","accomplish","mani","small","low","budget","film","potenti","becom","great","movi","thi","movi","near","fortun","thi","anoth","film","easili","make","easili","forget","thi","movi","probabl","chanc","actor","make","littl","monei","side","chanc","come","along","real","role","good","movi","anyon","shred","respect","film","avoid","see","thi","movi","cost"],"filtered2":["creativ","lose","begin","writer","director","leav","good","stori","line","onli","substitut","horribl","special","affect","seem","focu","amus","child","even","accomplish","mani","small","low","budget","potenti","becom","great","near","fortun","anoth","easili","make","easili","forget","probabl","chanc","actor","make","littl","monei","side","chanc","come","along","real","role","good","anyon","shred","respect","avoid","see","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,11,14,17,34,35,41,50,51,58,73,74,80,107,115,126,128,147,148,158,180,203,217,221,230,256,287,324,335,363,373,425,486,547,555,583,619,695,708,837,1128,1464,1849,1998,2979,3222],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,11,14,17,34,35,41,50,51,58,73,74,80,107,115,126,128,147,148,158,180,203,217,221,230,256,287,324,335,363,373,425,486,547,555,583,619,695,708,837,1128,1464,1849,1998,2979,3222],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.865701314626681,1.8950689206770979,1.9486336368009016,1.9951803900462557,2.1439533986393955,2.201553588425805,2.2391270689902285,2.3409902041158843,2.2844323215331563,2.3018654096236517,2.3106972614914807,2.7097314792693545,2.569760528637609,2.6113665294700725,2.6423424573643777,2.7121382192999195,2.748952192422636,2.841890188081905,2.8753661172782943,2.908534262247101,3.0349689855553557,3.0316467233633775,3.226987993365636,6.613389471952757,3.432149042129413,3.432149042129413,6.9973394489419505,3.5929222627171646,3.6284289511740746,3.6683728173057184,3.7881170224473255,4.251780369798478,4.506310234933358,4.798834931860927,4.8796870284900224,5.408212229355414,5.501738287366237]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.932930220116451E-5,8.8726933832936E-5,8.941670113799516E-5,8.89000504862318E-5,8.890150701346873E-5,8.877724047257957E-5,8.904127642458754E-5,8.873970993164879E-5,8.893922914903625E-5,0.1707244945560545,0.8223045917586008,8.859646447487417E-5,9.02500735495702E-5,9.153751067994756E-5,8.866106809253982E-5,8.8416047153981E-5,9.062147485083686E-5,8.904961892007678E-5,8.877334282427491E-5,8.884692014184463E-5,8.970656620398335E-5,8.91378445586418E-5,8.92393415174558E-5,8.933548689893542E-5,9.002109086505568E-5,8.955030590270804E-5,9.331483064228111E-5,8.862280339142479E-5,8.862517425895926E-5,8.884970563676758E-5,9.073818533013587E-5,8.904445925507848E-5,9.55816839009351E-5,8.929492817897571E-5,8.871926532744422E-5,8.912876322127224E-5,8.86303664065079E-5,8.868274043210265E-5,8.841560294461135E-5,8.843854203113987E-5,8.863760644105042E-5,8.957254537133943E-5,8.911738962709061E-5,8.876504438029353E-5,8.984363274534726E-5,8.8799112889381E-5,9.174946645150284E-5,9.040026380389815E-5,8.846052384358795E-5,8.865602701101459E-5,8.862527776071623E-5,9.111952622306178E-5,8.865734604368131E-5,8.84306907095252E-5,8.940134409413056E-5,8.868018182248515E-5,9.53657893460066E-5,8.860709782978529E-5,8.84595008483779E-5,8.88818690020659E-5,8.976350244272316E-5,8.887598896086297E-5,8.844313564295873E-5,8.864906193859082E-5,8.841667234697997E-5,9.046245088461914E-5,8.917834047464196E-5,8.898837755257291E-5,8.891055319453101E-5,8.923464629405975E-5,8.841344676654842E-5,8.891241716262902E-5,9.035451754497848

{"value":"How this piece of garbage was put to film is beyond me. The only actor who is at all known to me is Judge Reinhold, an accomplished actor whose presence is merely a justification for putting it into production.<br /><br />I don't even think it is worth a nomination for a rotten tomato award, this film really does make B movies a cinematic enjoyment. A car travelling along the freeway with police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car, yeah, right.<br /><br />The script must have been written on the back of a cigarette carton.

{"value":"Probably the worst Bollywood film I've seen.<br /><br />No plot line. Very little character developments.<br /><br />Full of silly and pointless humor. The whole film was chaotic and direction-less. There was no proper ending to the story. The airport was filmed in a shopping mall. <br /><br />Same story chewed over and over again until you want to say \"please, just move on with it!!\" Even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around... but then most of the Bollywood movies have that anyways these days.<br /><br />Btw I'm not from

{"value":"This could be a strong candidate for \"The Worst Flick Ever\". Perhaps without the presence of John Hurt, it could be tolerated as a kid-film. However, the TRAGEDY of this entire endeavor, is that John Hurt, one of the screen's greatest actors, diminishes himself in this....I gave it two points just because Mr. Hurt SHOWED UP...I take AWAY 8 points, because he didn't run from it fast enough. As far as the rest of the cast, they are, simply, terrible. Janine Turner, as pretty as she might be, cannot act to save her soul. And the lead actor is, for all intents and purposes, AWFUL.

{"value":"After reading several good reviews as well as hearing nice things about it by word of mouth I decided to rent Come Undone. I must say I was rather disappointed. The story was hard to follow because the film is set as a series of flashbacks between the present and recent past that are very poorly executed. The characters, despite the actors best efforts are flat and uninteresting. The sex is and nudity are more explicit than they need to be. I've never seen a film where they seemed so unnecessary to the plot. The ending is very anti-climatic and leaves many unanswered questions to a story line that wasn't explained well to begin with. In my opinion, a waste of time.","finished_norm":["after","read","sever","good","review","a","good","a","hear","nice","thing","about","it","by","word","of","mouth","i","decid","to","rend","come","undo","i","must","sai","i","be","rather","disappoint","the","stori","be","hard","to","follow","becaus","the","film","be","set","a","a","seri","of","flashback","between","the","present","and","recent","past","that","be","veri","poorli","execut","the","charact","despit","the","actor","well","effort","be","flat","and","uninterest","the","sex","be","and","nuditi","be","much","explicit","than","thei","ne","to","be","i","have","never","see","a","film","where","thei","seem","so","unnecessari","to","the","plot","the","end","be","veri","anticlimat","and","leav","mani","unansw","question","to","a","stori","line","that","be","not","explain","good","to","begin","with","in","my","opinion","a","wast","of","time"],"filtered":["read","sever","good","review","good","hear","nice","thing","word","mouth","decid","rend","come","undo","must","sai","rather","disappoint","stori","hard","follow","becaus","film","set","seri","flashback","present","recent","past","veri","poorli","execut","charact","despit","actor","well","effort","flat","uninterest","sex","nuditi","much","explicit","thei","ne","never","see","film","thei","seem","unnecessari","plot","end","veri","anticlimat","leav","mani","unansw","question","stori","line","explain","good","begin","opinion","wast","time"],"filtered2":["read","sever","good","review","good","hear","nice","thing","word","mouth","decid","rend","come","undo","must","rather","disappoint","stori","hard","follow","becaus","set","flashback","present","recent","past","veri","poorli","execut","charact","despit","actor","well","effort","flat","uninterest","sex","nuditi","explicit","ne","never","see","seem","unnecessari","plot","end","veri","anticlimat","leav","mani","unansw","question","stori","line","explain","good","begin","opinion","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,10,15,17,20,22,24,29,32,34,35,41,42,50,74,89,107,109,110,141,145,147,160,171,176,187,216,249,254,258,260,262,316,378,391,395,398,401,411,440,531,538,562,594,612,662,941,1051,1081,1248,4096,4584,6216,8206],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,10,15,17,20,22,24,29,32,34,35,41,42,50,74,89,107,109,110,141,145,147,160,171,176,187,216,249,254,258,260,262,316,378,391,395,398,401,411,440,531,538,562,594,612,662,941,1051,1081,1248,4096,4584,6216,8206],"values":[0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.4001215597131385,2.5541073880211935,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.717994385570355,1.9486336368009016,1.9940046109572438,2.1439533986393955,2.125691139326857,2.1290479736304078,2.2657547357741192,2.34599021453259,2.2844323215331563,2.3722295531801256,2.373087554090762,2.5040471493269134,2.4732161909892554,2.6070186965339692,2.6754694156628323,2.889652074525771,2.7061321952397077,2.6754694156628323,2.726701583487816,2.878207028279898,3.130944944345658,3.109204957709252,3.153168081130368,3.143848349181566,3.0879275592619675,3.229006157521873,3.212973749990824,3.424750734647968,3.43462735814388,3.432149042129413,3.490764544963862,3.5929222627171646,3.616452760127359,3.9612932464190886,4.191816905030921,4.1302590120314875,4.327618446189983,5.907203395474402,6.032366538428407,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.916981252556761E-5,7.863595197131644E-5,7.924727151464864E-5,7.878937993558754E-5,7.879067081087085E-5,7.868053719846177E-5,7.891454414025347E-5,7.864727503457761E-5,7.882410277918756E-5,8.745103919527807E-5,0.8507222782295448,7.852032099286299E-5,7.998586384619733E-5,8.112687976973941E-5,7.857757719181485E-5,7.836042267148896E-5,8.03150253941832E-5,7.892193783736744E-5,7.867708283267173E-5,0.14309090666858554,7.950417000558633E-5,7.900012950676402E-5,7.909008313903493E-5,7.917529383294363E-5,7.978292353705006E-5,7.936568130756319E-5,8.270206377709933E-5,7.854366436434419E-5,7.854576559130558E-5,7.87447608442536E-5,8.041846230165131E-5,7.891736498500495E-5,8.471110608559582E-5,7.913934788714126E-5,7.862915561080343E-5,7.899208099682033E-5,7.855036723195316E-5,7.859678471966854E-5,7.836002898238976E-5,7.838035918911051E-5,7.855678385184481E-5,7.938539146446389E-5,7.898200093018023E-5,7.866972817705403E-5,7.962564786465291E-5,7.869992204861712E-5,8.131472964972564E-5,8.011897284834239E-5,7.839984099326216E-5,7.857310943633659E-5,7.854585732172876E-5,8.075643300395445E-5,7.857427845441205E-5,7.83734008042917E-5,7.92336610390964E-5,7.859451710267444E-5,8.451976538307371E-5,7.852974500820941E-5,7.839893

{"value":"This movie is extremely boring, it tells a story of a female gas station owner and her life. Nothing exciting ever happens. The director has really \"kept it real\" and it feels just like a camera following a woman around as she lives her life. I had to watch other films by this director for a class, the others were not as boring. This film was also watched for an assignment...it better be worth the boringness with a good grade!! Overall, unless it's required, don't watch the film. But don't discount other films by this director, because they're not as bad...and don't discount other films about Africa, they're usually good, especially when done by a western director.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","extrem","bore","it","tell","a","stori","of","a","femal","ga","station","owner","and","her","life","noth","excit","ever","happen","the","director","have","realli","keep","it","real","and","it","feel","just","like","a","camera","follow","a","woman","around","a","she","live","her","life","i","have","to","watch","other","film","by","thi","director","for","a","class","the","other","be","not","a","bore","thi","film","be","conjur","watch","for","a","assignmentit","well","be","worth","the","boring","with","a","good","grade","overal","unless","it","requir","do","not","watch","the","film","but","do","not","discount","other","film","by","thi","director","becaus","thei","re","not","a","badand","do","not","discount","other","film","about","africa","thei","re","usual","good","especi","when","do","by","a","western","director"],"filtered":["thi","movi","extrem","bore","tell","stori","femal","ga","station","owner","life","noth","excit","ever","happen","director","realli","keep","real","feel","like","camera","follow","woman","around","live","life","watch","film","thi","director","class","bore","thi","film","conjur","watch","assignmentit","well","worth","boring","good","grade","overal","unless","requir","watch","film","discount","film","thi","director","becaus","thei","re","badand","discount","film","africa","thei","re","usual","good","especi","western","director"],"filtered2":["extrem","bore","tell","stori","femal","ga","station","owner","life","noth","excit","ever","happen","director","realli","keep","real","feel","like","camera","follow","woman","around","live","life","watch","director","class","bore","conjur","watch","assignmentit","well","worth","boring","good","grade","overal","unless","requir","watch","discount","director","becaus","re","badand","discount","africa","re","usual","good","especi","western","director"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,13,17,20,22,39,43,44,49,58,68,70,75,80,90,94,98,108,116,134,219,231,260,265,267,329,412,422,460,524,628,770,938,989,1259,1778,1866,2411,5946],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,13,17,20,22,39,43,44,49,58,68,70,75,80,90,94,98,108,116,134,219,231,260,265,267,329,412,422,460,524,628,770,938,989,1259,1778,1866,2411,5946],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,2.8828493162168796,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.5538940054862738,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,7.462805258506724,4.012839573363895,2.094675786251684,3.948450049740535,1.9951803900462557,2.0477128419653545,2.08112281984698,2.0881990796736947,4.277015007255866,2.2466628996789315,2.2443961816702407,2.5792094178355414,2.7049353070058615,2.6754694156628323,2.73529586597515,2.7085302779237206,2.951986790814132,3.107414446935464,3.2090054908152035,3.216957819005698,3.4028786598293,3.607563812710113,4.0536665665501035,3.952924996748572,4.044492190274062,4.390138803171316,4.828393734102471,5.02684467282631,5.339219357868463,12.978249881848246]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.560725317210845E-5,9.496255111281774E-5,9.570079439626045E-5,9.514783418670414E-5,9.51493930768428E-5,9.501639323980323E-5,9.529898530632712E-5,9.49762250996741E-5,9.518976627663869E-5,1.0560784947933015E-4,0.7533423214317236,9.482291253241857E-5,9.659273517243129E-5,9.797065176457003E-5,9.489205641105409E-5,9.462981570920121E-5,9.699023808988034E-5,9.530791410190342E-5,9.501222166967946E-5,9.509096990855827E-5,9.601103081439875E-5,9.540234012734757E-5,9.55109701647308E-5,0.17801404778979413,9.634765987293877E-5,9.584378873574537E-5,0.06127268895221883,9.485110251488661E-5,9.485364000400855E-5,9.509395116455988E-5,9.71151508348277E-5,9.530239182214056E-5,1.022990443914384E-4,9.557046338688717E-5,9.495434367440797E-5,9.539262056501318E-5,9.485919704915451E-5,9.49152518553748E-5,9.462934028135594E-5,9.465389149802536E-5,9.486694590421579E-5,9.586759116625205E-5,9.53804476489419E-5,9.500334002149558E-5,9.615773021984238E-5,9.503980282253916E-5,9.819750352108258E-5,9.675348060887473E-5,9.467741816459635E-5,9.48866610486616E-5,9.485375077973877E-5,9.752329188593255E-5,9.488807278128462E-5,9.464548839540559E-5,9.568435807867418E-5,9.491251342989245E-5,1.0206797703881265E-4,9.48342931861347E-5,9.467632327456998E-5,9.51283749307057E-5,9.607196846036406E-5,9.512208164760488E-5,9.46588079431035E-5,9.487920647971084E-5,9.463048483997758E-5,9.682003811938945E-5,9.544568204537517E-5,9.52423687681409E-5,9.515907501212886E-5,9.550594496694168E-5,9.46270325698115E-5,9.516106997755968E-5,9.670451936043288E-5,9.47966094683215E-5,9.714277616049583E-5,9.504724207291334E-5,9.579112944902808E-5,9.520569620579308E-5,9.459736420811544E-5,9.471462413805343E-5]}}

Basically the whole movie I just spent shaking my head and marveling at the stupidity of these drug addicts.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Don't rent this movie.

I was so anticipating to see his mother being an actual Jamaican, that it's driving me crazy. Just watching the beginning of the movie told me that the movie was not accurate. Which I completely lost interest just a matter of seconds from the beginning of the movie. I'm very disappointed, that's like watching a biography story on Mark Anthony and having Arnold play the part. I don't know what the writer was thinking missing a valuable piece of the movie which I'm sure his mother played a huge role in his life.

{"value":"The Comeback starts off looking promising, with a brutal death scene by a mask wearing killer. The mask itself is pretty cool too, and looks almost identical to the one used in the 1990's slasher film \"Granny\". From then on the film is mostly boring. We get a few more deaths, which again are good, but there's not enough of them. The reason the deaths are so good is because they are frenzied and bloody. The story behind the film is actually rather interesting and would have worked very well had it not been so boring for the most part. <br /><br />I would avoid this unless you're a die-hard collector - there's not enough here to even make it an average slasher flick.","finished_norm":["the","comeback","start","off","look","promis","with","a","brutal","death","scene","by","a","mask","wear","killer","the","mask","itself","be","pretti","cool","too","and","look","almost","ident","to","the","on","us","in","the","slasher","film","granni","from","then","on","the","film","be","mostli","bore","we","get","a","few","much","death","which","again","be","good","but","there","not","enough","of","them","the","reason","the","death","be","so","good","be","becaus","thei","be","frenzi","and","bloodi","the","stori","behind","the","film","be","actual","rather","interest","and","would","have","work","veri","good","have","it","not","be","so","bore","for","the","much","part","br","br","i","would","avoid","thi","unless","you","re","a","diehard","collector","there","not","enough","here","to","even","make","it","a","averag","slasher","flick"],"filtered":["comeback","start","look","promis","brutal","death","scene","mask","wear","killer","mask","pretti","cool","look","almost","ident","us","slasher","film","granni","film","mostli","bore","get","much","death","good","enough","reason","death","good","becaus","thei","frenzi","bloodi","stori","behind","film","actual","rather","interest","work","veri","good","bore","much","part","br","br","avoid","thi","unless","re","diehard","collector","enough","even","make","averag","slasher","flick"],"filtered2":["comeback","start","look","promis","brutal","death","scene","mask","wear","killer","mask","pretti","cool","look","almost","ident","us","slasher","granni","mostli","bore","get","death","good","enough","reason","death","good","becaus","frenzi","bloodi","stori","behind","actual","rather","interest","work","veri","good","bore","part","avoid","unless","re","diehard","collector","enough","even","make","averag","slasher","flick"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,15,16,17,19,22,48,52,56,60,61,68,71,78,93,95,108,131,160,245,252,257,335,393,460,481,510,514,643,683,731,1179,1191,1340,1608,3337,4740,5569,5790,7498],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,15,16,17,19,22,48,52,56,60,61,68,71,78,93,95,108,131,160,245,252,257,335,393,460,481,510,514,643,683,731,1179,1191,1340,1608,3337,4740,5569,5790,7498],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,1.6955116224012472,1.7122153074726136,1.8610609350701788,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.0064197866819473,1.9214926742550966,2.0064197866819473,4.070779654240196,2.0323326556775485,4.277015007255866,2.2512118082053005,2.3722295531801256,8.250608922972866,3.0433232530252132,2.7602659523229094,2.908534262247101,3.120015873813468,3.216957819005698,3.353630724994973,3.374440724508766,3.405285399859865,3.5813614403160887,3.6105180246075443,8.19205168077849,4.274508620876034,4.3215761317340196,9.086429583737619,4.605250182788262,5.541743621979936,6.1754673820690815,6.2980697041614135,6.437831646536572,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.511831756337999E-5,8.45443448490119E-5,8.52015965130252E-5,8.470930078068994E-5,8.47106886472112E-5,8.459228003291253E-5,8.484386932620571E-5,8.455651868224087E-5,8.474663256074557E-5,9.402176268975448E-5,0.7668018416517672,8.44200258184346E-5,8.599568373669189E-5,8.722243106154582E-5,8.448158402060016E-5,8.424811337273858E-5,8.634957717507872E-5,8.48518185563332E-5,8.458856611980706E-5,8.465867500152943E-5,8.547779733548043E-5,8.493588523698068E-5,8.503259762764275E-5,8.512421071440576E-5,8.577749529933982E-5,8.53289031471373E-5,8.89159681343527E-5,8.444512311806626E-5,8.444738222286981E-5,8.466132918818017E-5,8.646078592064327E-5,8.484690211801985E-5,0.16262228404000253,8.508556393310974E-5,8.453703783698336E-5,8.492723199399014E-5,8.445232961250557E-5,8.450223472575282E-5,8.424769010340526E-5,8.426954784105276E-5,8.44592283517118E-5,8.535009424688577E-5,8.491639455120784E-5,8.458065886459871E-5,8.56084025580406E-5,8.461312138365981E-5,8.742439523486942E-5,8.613879402019127E-5,8.429049343053426E-5,8.447678057573318E-5,8.44474808455524E-5,8.682415039819034E-5,8.447803742918033E-5,8.426206663085608E-5,8.518696340043737E-5,8.449979672903085E-5,9.087024461420197E-5,8.443015791683663E-5,8.428951865933365E-5,8.469197637195871E-5,0.06401615584676458,8.468637351598578E-5,8.427392490994198E-5,8.447014383692734E-5,8.424870909413027E-5,8.619804960099977E-5,8.497447217489676E-5,8.479346410780666E-5,8.47193083911633E-5,8.502812373714759E-5,8.424563556760835E-5,8.472108449177738E-5,8.609520424059921E-5,8.439660842604625E-5,8.648538051116854E-5,8.461974448446829E-5,8.52820210357833E-5,8.476081484005534E-5,8.42192220796287E-5,8.432361758962157E-5]}}

{"value":"I've seen better production quality on YouTube! I pity the actors, as the writing was terrible and the direction shocking, not sure how they could get the lines out - I really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no matter how good they were. The characters were not developed at all, and there was no real cohesion in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much. It's a shame really, as the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality, direction and script it could have been a decent movie. It certainly was not a comedy, unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing - which was amateurish, even the English actors sounded weird.","finished_norm":["i","have","see","well","product","qualiti","on","youtub","i","piti","the","actor","a","the","write","be","terribl","and","the","direct","shock","not","sure","how","thei","can","get","the","line","out","i","realli","doubt","ani","actor","would","have","be","abl","to","salvag","thi","movi","no","matt","how","good","thei","be","the","charact","be","not","develop","at","all","and","there","be","no","real","cohes","in","the","plot","which","just","seem","to","go","nowher","much","it","a","shame","realli","a","the","premis","for","the","movi","be","good","and","with","well","product","qualiti","direct","and","script","it","can","have","be","a","decent","movi","it","certainli","be","not","a","comedi","unless","you","laugh","out","loud","at","the","dub","which","be","amateurish","even","the","english","actor","sound","weird"],"filtered":["see","well","product","qualiti","youtub","piti","actor","write","terribl","direct","shock","sure","thei","get","line","realli","doubt","ani","actor","abl","salvag","thi","movi","matt","good","thei","charact","develop","real","cohes","plot","seem","go","nowher","much","shame","realli","premis","movi","good","well","product","qualiti","direct","script","decent","movi","certainli","comedi","unless","laugh","loud","dub","amateurish","even","english","actor","sound","weird"],"filtered2":["see","well","product","qualiti","youtub","piti","actor","write","terribl","direct","shock","sure","get","line","realli","doubt","ani","actor","abl","salvag","matt","good","charact","develop","real","cohes","plot","seem","go","nowher","shame","realli","premis","good","well","product","qualiti","direct","script","decent","certainli","comedi","unless","laugh","loud","dub","amateurish","even","english","actor","sound","weird"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,6,10,13,20,27,32,35,41,65,77,80,102,107,119,127,133,166,178,190,309,319,320,389,408,454,460,484,508,567,574,588,625,799,949,956,1188,1266,3499,3940,4368],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,6,10,13,20,27,32,35,41,65,77,80,102,107,119,127,133,166,178,190,309,319,320,389,408,454,460,484,508,567,574,588,625,799,949,956,1188,1266,3499,3940,4368],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,2.2635883139467947,2.330690080046114,1.3002700588679295,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,4.70627975028631,1.9073850067444174,1.9463902258768238,1.9951803900462557,4.175107420354542,2.1439533986393955,2.1653408989309972,2.4359679371086367,2.3212364753796515,2.4423870329693536,2.532833256045391,5.116663665627972,2.848772527704847,5.811212004936025,2.938298364153555,3.0914425013694116,3.130944944345658,3.2556198060399626,3.216957819005698,3.291526514503207,3.4149707055943286,3.454678155189441,3.5039747767006686,3.6375061693251913,3.6194333882654965,3.7636829971100436,4.086456389373095,3.969732115064953,4.213208095012239,4.327618446189983,5.649374286172302,5.7959777603641776,5.9370563586240825]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.335111849160561E-5,9.272163007590677E-5,9.344245233511583E-5,9.290254085004774E-5,9.2904062953583E-5,9.277420163935306E-5,9.305012511389709E-5,9.273498138477642E-5,9.294348342883969E-5,1.0311572127944636E-4,0.992612123585416,9.25852866790164E-5,9.431334514210748E-5,9.565874573459954E-5,9.265279890422231E-5,9.239674654396967E-5,9.470146780766243E-5,9.305884320824847E-5,9.27701285097107E-5,9.284701845199725E-5,9.374536781139152E-5,9.31510409735588E-5,9.32571075653189E-5,9.335758163908601E-5,9.407405311599825E-5,9.358207230207437E-5,9.75160848418464E-5,9.261281143583493E-5,9.261528904542871E-5,9.284992935648438E-5,9.482343286855274E-5,9.305345124293849E-5,9.988499719129194E-5,9.331519686970429E-5,9.271361631617535E-5,9.314155077291962E-5,9.26207149557302E-5,9.26754469837289E-5,9.239628233524445E-5,9.242025419365873E-5,9.262828095373767E-5,9.360531304414042E-5,9.312966511264956E-5,9.276145645017017E-5,9.388860541236688E-5,9.279705880404837E-5,9.588024425588967E-5,9.447029731661882E-5,9.244322567925122E-5,9.26475308612936E-5,9.261539720707937E-5,9.522194262967297E-5,9.264890927992815E-5,9.24120493869905E-5,9.342640388084428E-5,9.267277317945985E-5,9.965938255329289E-5,9.259639877269464E-5,9.244215662637922E-5,9.288354079249774E-5,9.38048674541526E-5,9.287739601794398E-5,9.242505462073741E-5,9.264025220484927E-5,9.239739988463493E-5,9.453528420667599E-5,9.319336011139832E-5,9.299484460965237E-5,9.291351641509486E-5,9.325220095186968E-5,9.239402908094959E-5,9.291546430344161E-5,9.442249145301382E-5,9.255960431317333E-5,9.485040629331136E-5,9.280432250340303E-5,9.353065566629695E-5,9.295903744440562E-5,9.23650608316144E-5,9.247955366820133E-5]}}

I wish these were my problems. I do enjoy Dylan Baker and Sinise but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a pay check for Sinise.

{"value":"Jude Law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers little else of value. Completely lacking in eroticism, excitement, or leading ladies with appeal. One decent fight, a few moments of mild suspense. And a one-note plot.<br /><br />The movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between Law's character and a dogged homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. But despite their best efforts, both actors are staked to the cross of the film's banality.<br /><br />With a lesser actor in the lead role -- and without the benefit of Oliver Curtis's cinematography -- Crocodiles would blend into the sea of low-budget vampire quickies.","finished_norm":["jude","law","give","hi","all","in","thi","beautifulli","film","vampir","flick","which","offer","littl","els","of","valu","complet","lack","in","erotic","excit","or","lead","ladi","with","appeal","on","decent","fight","a","few","moment","of","mild","suspens","and","a","onenot","plotbr","br","the","movi","wax","philisoph","in","a","seri","of","convers","between","law","charact","and","a","dog","homicid","detect","good","plai","by","timothi","spall","but","despit","their","well","effort","both","actor","be","stake","to","the","cross","of","the","film","banalitybr","br","with","a","lesser","actor","in","the","lead","role","and","without","the","benefit","of","oliv","curti","cinematographi","crocodil","would","blend","into","the","sea","of","lowbudget","vampir","quicki"],"filtered":["jude","law","give","hi","thi","beautifulli","film","vampir","flick","offer","littl","els","valu","complet","lack","erotic","excit","lead","ladi","appeal","decent","fight","moment","mild","suspens","onenot","plotbr","br","movi","wax","philisoph","seri","convers","law","charact","dog","homicid","detect","good","plai","timothi","spall","despit","well","effort","actor","stake","cross","film","banalitybr","br","lesser","actor","lead","role","without","benefit","oliv","curti","cinematographi","crocodil","blend","sea","lowbudget","vampir","quicki"],"filtered2":["jude","law","give","beautifulli","vampir","flick","offer","littl","els","valu","complet","lack","erotic","excit","lead","ladi","appeal","decent","fight","moment","mild","suspens","onenot","plotbr","wax","philisoph","convers","law","charact","dog","homicid","detect","good","plai","timothi","spall","despit","well","effort","actor","stake","cross","banalitybr","lesser","actor","lead","role","without","benefit","oliv","curti","cinematographi","crocodil","blend","sea","lowbudget","vampir","quicki"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,14,20,30,40,41,103,125,128,157,183,188,196,232,257,309,391,401,451,472,485,507,524,529,609,629,689,1029,1063,1222,1255,1305,1597,2154,2277,2452,2500,2739,2779,2925,3230,3344,3689,4366,4411,4619,5114,5292,5622],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,14,20,30,40,41,103,125,128,157,183,188,196,232,257,309,391,401,451,472,485,507,524,529,609,629,689,1029,1063,1222,1255,1305,1597,2154,2277,2452,2500,2739,2779,2925,3230,3344,3689,4366,4411,4619,5114,5292,5622],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.3364419891718522,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,2.098582041218749,2.2242236634876535,2.3409902041158843,4.672030138951541,2.4885128563647294,2.5378812223426954,2.478925055209576,2.8377834061292515,2.7602659523229094,2.848772527704847,3.109204957709252,3.0879275592619675,3.216957819005698,3.4222967456864013,8.321128723053633,3.365138331846453,3.4028786598293,3.4648563601051974,3.68099128126493,3.488143311483988,3.634471265630037,8.560544651185568,4.327618446189983,4.3336974922663645,4.3095999406873045,4.456830177669989,4.751432692966343,5.7446844659766265,5.214056214914456,5.116075806554253,5.156897801074508,5.390512652256013,5.339219357868463,5.3560264761848435,5.626901430320244,5.541743621979936,5.7959777603641776,5.9370563586240825,5.999576715605417,6.255510089742618,6.214688095222362,6.214688095222362,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.100396301965011E-5,6.059259903544628E-5,6.106364871492585E-5,6.071082230211817E-5,6.0711816980588834E-5,6.062695399298919E-5,6.080726704878671E-5,6.060132397378348E-5,6.073757784187935E-5,0.5793050627504649,7.847947423862067E-5,6.05035000757737E-5,6.163276790117937E-5,6.251197287822934E-5,6.054761859686251E-5,6.038029110289841E-5,6.188640193491331E-5,6.081296423071668E-5,6.062429224609111E-5,6.06745390055475E-5,6.126160075675879E-5,0.11774144866434316,6.094252787925429E-5,6.1008186617784285E-5,6.14763931073093E-5,6.115488887828725E-5,6.372572422951738E-5,6.052148721159183E-5,6.052310630310865E-5,6.0676441250668457E-5,6.196610480494278E-5,6.0809440638737405E-5,6.527378325331325E-5,6.098048862181232E-5,6.0587362128698896E-5,6.086701274452317E-5,6.052665207777883E-5,6.056241887592729E-5,6.0379987747433954E-5,6.039565310193476E-5,6.053159637700215E-5,6.117007645603089E-5,6.085924559195666E-5,6.061862514742039E-5,6.135520500547177E-5,6.064189090700091E-5,6.265671980595794E-5,0.037829963360030104,6.0410664723436816E-5,6.054417598684131E-5,6.052317698559691E-5,6.222652669514793E-5,6.054507676875766E-5,6.039029134804622E-5,6.105316122075627E-5,6.056067157327697E-5,0.18230515639316583,6.051076171080037E-5,6.040996610875579E-5,6.0698405966600384E-5,6.130048314044448E-5,6.069439042178744E-5,6.0398790129971684E-5,6.0539419462273236E-5,6.0380718054074E-5,6.177780271925463E-5,6.090086959615704E-5,6.077114

{"value":"I wasn't expecting this to be a great movie, but neither was I expecting it to be so awful. I hated the mother character so much I had to turn the channel. I turned it back, hoping it was just one part of the movie, but no. And for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed, or almost done out of a job, or driven to madness inside her own home? Are you kidding me? I was raised to respect (and even fear) my mother but I'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in MY house. I was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house, after all.<br /><br />I didn't buy any of it. I tried giving it several chances, I really did.

{"value":"MST 3000 should do this movie. It is the worst acted movie I have ever seen. First of all, you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash. There is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job. Also, the head of security for the POTHUS would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot. This movie sucked. I cannot express the extremite that this movie was. Every single actor was terrible. Even the chick at the trailer park. I crap on this garbage.
