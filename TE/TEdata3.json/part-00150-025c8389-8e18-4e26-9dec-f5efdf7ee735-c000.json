{"value":"This is is a thoroughly unpleasant, if slickly made, movie. I tried it because it stars Richard Dreyfus and Jeff Goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot line - a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution - sounded promising. The movie is billed as a comedy, sorta. What we have is an endless series of shots - you should pardon the pun - of people in dimly lit and elegant, if somewhat surreal, interiors, shooting each other - in the head, stomach, kneecap, foot, heart (no part of the anatomy is avoided, it seems) while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue, some of which is supposed, evidently, to be humorous in a sort of post-modern way. Goldblum's dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3x5 card, and he wears a single facial expression - a sardonic grin - throughout. Ellen Barkin and Gregory Hines do the best they can. Burt Reynolds does a cameo. The credits list Rob Reiner and Joey Bishop, but I somehow missed them (good move on their part). The whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and unsavory; an heir, I suspect, to the style of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Fargo' and 'Natural Born Killers'. If you liked those, you'll probably like this.","finished_norm":["thi","be","be","a","thoroughli","unpleas","if","slickli","make","movi","i","try","it","becaus","it","star","richard","dreyfu","and","jeff","goldblum","two","good","actor","and","becaus","the","plot","line","a","mob","boss","be","about","to","be","releas","from","a","mental","institut","sound","promis","the","movi","be","bill","a","a","comedi","sorta","what","we","have","be","a","endless","seri","of","shot","you","should","pardon","the","pun","of","peopl","in","dimli","light","and","eleg","if","somewhat","surreal","interior","shoot","each","other","in","the","head","stomach","kneecap","foot","heart","no","part","of","the","anatomi","be","avoid","it","seem","while","utter","vagu","and","cryptic","dialogu","some","of","which","be","suppos","evid","to","be","humor","in","a","sort","of","postmodern","wai","goldblum","dialogu","for","the","whole","movi","can","fit","on","a","x","card","and","he","wear","a","singl","facial","express","a","sardon","grin","throughout","ellen","barkin","and","gregori","hine","do","the","well","thei","can","burt","reynold","doe","a","cameo","the","credit","list","rob","reiner","and","joei","bishop","but","i","somehow","miss","them","good","move","on","their","part","the","whole","thing","be","cold","steril","mechan","and","unsavori","a","heir","i","suspect","to","the","styl","of","pulp","fiction","fargo","and","natur","bear","killer","if","you","like","that","you","will","probabl","like","thi"],"filtered":["thi","thoroughli","unpleas","slickli","make","movi","try","becaus","star","richard","dreyfu","jeff","goldblum","two","good","actor","becaus","plot","line","mob","boss","releas","mental","institut","sound","promis","movi","bill","comedi","sorta","endless","seri","shot","pardon","pun","peopl","dimli","light","eleg","somewhat","surreal","interior","shoot","head","stomach","kneecap","foot","heart","part","anatomi","avoid","seem","utter","vagu","cryptic","dialogu","suppos","evid","humor","sort","postmodern","wai","goldblum","dialogu","whole","movi","fit","x","card","wear","singl","facial","express","sardon","grin","throughout","ellen","barkin","gregori","hine","well","thei","burt","reynold","doe","cameo","credit","list","rob","reiner","joei","bishop","somehow","miss","good","move","part","whole","thing","cold","steril","mechan","unsavori","heir","suspect","styl","pulp","fiction","fargo","natur","bear","killer","like","probabl","like","thi"],"filtered2":["thoroughli","unpleas","slickli","make","try","becaus","star","richard","dreyfu","jeff","goldblum","two","good","actor","becaus","plot","line","mob","boss","releas","mental","institut","sound","promis","bill","comedi","sorta","endless","shot","pardon","pun","peopl","dimli","light","eleg","somewhat","surreal","interior","shoot","head","stomach","kneecap","foot","heart","part","anatomi","avoid","seem","utter","vagu","cryptic","dialogu","suppos","evid","humor","sort","postmodern","wai","goldblum","dialogu","whole","fit","x","card","wear","singl","facial","express","sardon","grin","throughout","ellen","barkin","gregori","hine","well","burt","reynold","doe","cameo","credit","list","rob","reiner","joei","bishop","somehow","miss","good","move","part","whole","thing","cold","steril","mechan","unsavori","heir","suspect","styl","pulp","fiction","fargo","natur","bear","killer","like","probabl","like"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,18,20,22,23,29,32,33,35,36,41,47,61,100,107,111,117,127,148,149,178,208,248,252,255,269,275,327,335,353,356,369,380,438,441,443,456,514,525,549,596,601,614,641,676,683,722,846,911,916,977,981,1015,1024,1106,1199,1251,1320,1508,1553,1577,1590,1825,1869,2001,2228,2338,2370,2375,2497,2589,2890,3099,3253,3305,3324,3630,3888,4160,4459,4471,4858,5089,5317,5463,5811,6428,6598,7388,7429,7818],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,18,20,22,23,29,32,33,35,36,41,47,61,100,107,111,117,127,148,149,178,208,248,252,255,269,275,327,335,353,356,369,380,438,441,443,456,514,525,549,596,601,614,641,676,683,722,846,911,916,977,981,1015,1024,1106,1199,1251,1320,1508,1553,1577,1590,1825,1869,2001,2228,2338,2370,2375,2497,2589,2890,3099,3253,3305,3324,3630,3888,4160,4459,4471,4858,5089,5317,5463,5811,6428,6598,7388,7429,7818],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.357228929984541,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,2.5958480334723544,1.364847727375781,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.5687599167621034,1.7064694353107215,3.7637034094785053,2.1405462403177813,2.1439533986393955,4.236691060675177,2.2797301185117202,2.4359679371086367,2.3018

{"value":"This is an installment in the notorious Guinea Pig series. A short lived japanese TV-show, that got cancelled after a psychopath admitted to being inspired in the killing of a young schoolgirl by the show. This short in the series is, like all the other films in the series, practically without any story. A group of guys have captured a young woman. They tie her down and proceeds to torturing her to death while videofilming her. They beat her, pour boiling oil over her, use pliers on her and finally, in \"loving\" closeup, push a needle through her eye. This is the most straightforward of all the Guinea Pig movies, and one of the first. It was probably this film, more than any of the others, that gave Guinea Pig the rumour of being snuff. They certainly gave inspiration to Nicolas Cage's movie \"8 mm.\". These movies have gotten quite popular in horror circles. They have progressed to more polished, but equally graphic movies like \"Naked Blood\". They probably fill the void left by the Mondo movies, that got slightly cleaned up and became reality TV. Not recommended, but will probably allure those who will see anything once, and wonder why afterwards, I know I did.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","instal","in","the","notori","guinea","pig","seri","a","short","live","japanes","tvshow","that","get","cancel","after","a","psychopath","admit","to","be","inspir","in","the","kill","of","a","young","schoolgirl","by","the","show","thi","short","in","the","seri","be","like","all","the","other","film","in","the","seri","practic","without","ani","stori","a","group","of","gui","have","captur","a","young","woman","thei","tie","her","down","and","proce","to","tortur","her","to","death","while","videofilm","her","thei","beat","her","pour","boil","oil","over","her","us","plier","on","her","and","final","in","love","closeup","push","a","needl","through","her","ey","thi","be","the","much","straightforward","of","all","the","guinea","pig","movi","and","on","of","the","it","be","probabl","thi","film","much","than","ani","of","the","other","that","give","guinea","pig","the","rumour","of","be","snuff","thei","certainli","give","inspir","to","nicola","cage","movi","mm","thi","movi","have","get","quit","popular","in","horror","circl","thei","have","progress","to","much","polish","but","equal","graphic","movi","like","nake","blood","thei","probabl","fill","the","void","leav","by","the","mondo","movi","that","get","slightli","clean","up","and","becom","realiti","tv","not","recommend","but","will","probabl","allur","that","who","will","see","anyth","onc","and","wonder","why","afterward","i","know","i","do"],"filtered":["thi","instal","notori","guinea","pig","seri","short","live","japanes","tvshow","get","cancel","psychopath","admit","inspir","kill","young","schoolgirl","show","thi","short","seri","like","film","seri","practic","without","ani","stori","group","gui","captur","young","woman","thei","tie","proce","tortur","death","videofilm","thei","beat","pour","boil","oil","us","plier","final","love","closeup","push","needl","ey","thi","much","straightforward","guinea","pig","movi","probabl","thi","film","much","ani","give","guinea","pig","rumour","snuff","thei","certainli","give","inspir","nicola","cage","movi","mm","thi","movi","get","quit","popular","horror","circl","thei","progress","much","polish","equal","graphic","movi","like","nake","blood","thei","probabl","fill","void","leav","mondo","movi","get","slightli","clean","becom","realiti","tv","recommend","probabl","allur","see","anyth","onc","wonder","afterward","know"],"filtered2":["instal","notori","guinea","pig","short","live","japanes","tvshow","get","cancel","psychopath","admit","inspir","kill","young","schoolgirl","show","short","like","practic","without","ani","stori","group","gui","captur","young","woman","tie","proce","tortur","death","videofilm","beat","pour","boil","oil","us","plier","final","love","closeup","push","needl","ey","straightforward","guinea","pig","probabl","ani","give","guinea","pig","rumour","snuff","certainli","give","inspir","nicola","cage","mm","get","quit","popular","horror","circl","progress","polish","equal","graphic","like","nake","blood","probabl","fill","void","leav","mondo","get","slightli","clean","becom","realiti","tv","recommend","probabl","allur","see","anyth","onc","wonder","afterward","know"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,17,26,27,28,30,54,55,56,70,74,76,83,104,115,116,120,125,135,148,156,172,175,236,245,272,281,298,354,389,410,553,656,678,691,802,843,893,906,909,917,925,951,965,1146,1175,1256,1380,1495,1504,1878,1948,2163,2238,2268,2399,2585,2598,2744,3126,3142,3258,3284,3461,3695,4461,4656,4922,5119,5605,6613],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,17,26,27,28,30,54,55,56,70,74,76,83,104,115,116,120,125,135,148,156,172,175,236,245,272,281,298,354,389,410,553,656,678,691,802,843,893,906,909,917,925,951,965,1146,1175,1256,1380,1495,1504,1878,1948,2163,2238,2268,2399,2585,2598,2744,3126,3142,3258,3284,3461,3695,4461,4656,4922,5119,5605,6613],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,2.389902141215977,1.2770536940105968,1.3324924169710188,2.600540117735859,1.5452294193519092,2.6728839783437044,1.8113893252729412,1.9536997889255368,1.8610609350701788,2.094675786251684,1.9486336368009016,2.1337665533324026,2.292318797740072,2.0728240170322856,2.201553588425805,2.2466628996789315,2.2044500422972613,2.2242236634876535,4.732488142874176,6.905596228870955,2.3451551414151686,2.5001408943598484,2.3791142619576227,2.617923930016232,2.7502029743242886,5.605761068896383,2.832333801361687,2.7819920465008363,3.185521045582134,3.0914425013694116,3.2070272508030975,3.454678155189441,3.68099128126493,3.6715125373103863,3.5929222627171646,3.8883864756110005,4.339813719283801,4.017463517886143,3.9081109809587793,7.922586492838177,3.9363956947973615,3.969732115064953,4.004218291

{"value":"I'm not going to approach and critique the theories of RAW. I mean, this is a site about movies and whether the movie delivers or is well-made, and not a site debating philosophy.<br /><br />Having said that, this video really blows. It's one talking-head shot of RAW after another. Some of it is archival video, so you can see how he has aged over the years, and that's pretty cool. But, otherwise, the viewing experience is relentlessly monotonous.<br /><br />It's a strange comparison, but I kept thinking of the Sunday afternoon when I watched some of the Barbra Streisand star vehicle *Funny Lady* (another really bad movie). After a while, I was so OD'd on Barbra, I kept wishing there would be one scene that she wouldn't appear in: you know, a \"meanwhile, other characters in the movie were up to something else...\" moment. But it was all about Barbra. Well this video is RAW's *Funny Lady*. <br /><br />So, if your idea of a good time is to look at multiple takes and angles of the face of RAW while he prattles on with his theories, assembled in a lame structure that doesn't add any interest or insight, then be my guest.

{"value":"By now you should already know about this film, the Jessica Simpson \"bomb\" that pretty much went straight to video (limited, anemic theatrical run). Basically, Ms. Simpson's Katie travels from a small town in Oklahoma to visit her boyfriend, to surprise him, only to find him in bed with another woman. She is stranded, but has one friend (Rachel Leigh Cook, whom I wish we saw more often in film), who lets her stay. Katie ends up getting a job via two conniving co-workers (Penelope Ann Miller and the always amusing Andy Dick) who are just using Katie to get the president of the firm (Larry Miller) ousted. This is strictly a b movie, its not meant to be profound. Jessica Simpson is not a great actress by any means, but she is pretty much beautiful and never truly annoying. The film is watchable in that its not an abomination, but its throwaway fluff. In a cameo, Penny Marshall is funny (a subtle in-joke about Milwaukee made me chuckle), and there is a funny scene involving Norwegian priests (don't read too much into this). So, not horrible, but easy to skip. Your safe bet is to watch it on television if it ever does.

{"value":"Russell Hopton acted in many films until his death in 1945. He only directed 2 and \"Black Gold\" was one, (the other was also from 1936). Frankie Darro had a sometimes abrasive screen presence but in this he was playing a good kid. He was obviously quite popular on the \"quickie\" circuit - he made so many films. In this one he plays the son of an old oil rigger who is convinced that he will strike oil very soon.<br /><br />J.C. Anderson (Berton Churchill) is trying to convince the old man to sell up as he knows there is going to be oil struck at any moment. A geologist, Henry, comes on the scene and helps \"Fishtail's\" dad. He also convinces \"Fishtail\" to go to school regularly. Henry has his eye on Cynthia, the pretty teacher. This was Gloria Shea's last film - she had begun her career as Olive Shea in \"Glorifying the American Girl\" (1929). \"Fishtail's\" dad is killed when the rig is sabotaged and Henry is determined to bring Anderson and his cronies to justice.

{"value":"I saw not so fabulous rating on IMDb, but I went to see it anyway, because I am a big fan of Bible related material. First thing that bothered me was a little too much Indiana Jones wannabe movie, but it also looked like Casper Van Dien didn't see those Jones movies through (but he should). I believe he tried his best, but script just stunk. Music tried to be kinda Jones style too. Great work, but for such movie it seemed like too much work, like the video part did't deserve all that great music. Robert Wagner gave his best acting skills, he did a good job, but somehow the script was bringing everything down. \"Jokes\" are old school, somewhere 20 years old; they brought only cynic smile to my face. There are some really bad camera angels, SFX looks like homemade and unrealistic. Kevin VanHook had probably a good idea on the story (in my opinion, but I love such stories), but things just didn't work out in the end. Maybe he should put it on a paper when it was still fresh in his head. When I (in first minutes) saw that movie was going to be one of those 'low budget movies', I hoped that I will at least 'hear' a good story, but sometimes movies just

{"value":"This must be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was actually expecting a bad movie but I was caught by surprise believe it or not. The storyline is the traditional, all clichées are included.<br /><br />The dialogue is so poorly written that you actually laugh when the otherwise half-descent actors are trying to make it sound real. The photo is not too good, the music is so malplacée it actually made me angry, the actors are not even trying, altho the script makes it almost impossible you could expect more from people that have been acting for 30 years and the so called action scenes actually manage to lack the \"action\" itself.<br /><br />I dont understand why these types of bad movies keep on coming, who is financing this shit? Where is the screening ? And why on earth do actors take on this mission impossible script?<br /><br />There are a million hollywood-movies in this genre without even aspiration of reaching the theaters, but even them

{"value":"One thing that astonished me about this film (and not in a good way) was that Nathan Stoltzfus, who seems to pride himself on being the major historian on the topic of the Rosenstrasse, was one of the historians working on this film, considering how much of the actual events were altered or disregarded. <br /><br />Another reviewer said that von Trotta said she never meant for Lena to bed Goebbels, but in that case, why did she give every impression that that was what had happened? Why not show other possible reasons for the mens' release, such as the disaster that was Stalingrad, or the Nazis' fear that the international press, based in Berlin, would find out about the protest.<br /><br />Also, why did the whole storyline play second fiddle to a weak family bonding storyline that has been done over and over again? Surely something as awesome as this could carry its own history! In places, it was as if the film had two story lines that really seemed to have little in common.<br /><br />Overall, this film failed in its aim, which was to draw attention to a little-known act of

{"value":"It seems like this is the only film that John Saxon ever directed, and that he had the good sense to stop after that and stay in front of the camera. This movie is a dog, from start to finish, and it's dull and wooden with nothing much going for it. A Viet Nam war hero takes a job working for a mob boss, gets a bit too friendly with the wife and then the wife is killed by the mob boss himself & the war hero framed and sent to prison, death row, specifically. Now, this particular prison has been experimenting on inmates and is testing some formula that will turn men into the ultimate killing machine (a zombie). Of course, everything goes wrong and then there's all these infected people trapped in the prison, some of whom are turning into zombies and the rest who suddenly just don't want to be there anymore. This just goes on and on and on with nothing particularly much to show or say for itself, and I stopped it before the end, which seemed like it was coming a few times but no, it was apparently only getting set to take off on a different and equally dull path.

{"value":"Iam a Big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma but i could not believe that he made this movie. i was really disappointed.<br /><br />Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag doesn't come anywhere close to the real Sholay. It does not leave a lasting impression on a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma fails to create chemistry between the characters . There is no camaraderie between Heero(Ajay Devgan) and Raj(Prashant raj). There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together. The sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan should not have done this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen was trying their best but no use. Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation - ineffective and rather pointless. Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language. Rest of the cast was below expectation. The comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay fall flat in this movie.<br /><br />Ram Gopal Varma could have worked upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he messed up and just for the sake of making he made this Aag.

{"value":"Once in a while in Indian cinema there comes along a movie like Sholay that changes the way the audience perceives a good movie. And den just once in a while(hopefully) we have a RGV ki Aag that breaks all the standards and creates one of its own. A standard so low, it can never be broken. Ram Gopal varma manages to take a melting pot of talent and create a dish so stale u can smell it from a distance. To take a classic like Sholay and assassinate it is totally unforgivable and I can't believe he almost called the movie RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay had a lot of folklore elements in it, the movie managed to build on its plot by merely defining the characters so distinctively that they lived on forever. What Aag does is take these characters and mess them up so badly u'll need a contest to pick the worst. The realism element is totally missing and what the movie ends up providing is a bunch of \"actors\" parading along in a plot less and seemingly unrelated set of events. One star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a vote. its time for RGV to wake up to the reality of his failure and conjure up another \"different\" plot that can be categorized under

{"value":"Eh, not a particular good slasher flick. So-so acting, effects, decent yet familiar and uninventive soundtrack.<br /><br />There are three deaths in close succession near the beginning of the movie that make for a fairly good scene in which it would seem anything goes. Apart from that, there's a lot of characters wandering around, not realizing what's going on, or chasing after red herrings; more killing of time, than of people. There are other deaths, and the killer is an equal opportunity murderer, not partial to any one implement. The killer also likes to set other people up to kill innocent people as well. The identity isn't revealed towards the end, and motive is pretty thin, and we really don't care.<br /><br />Supposedly the movie takes place around Christmas, but this isn't a major factor. One scene gets lit by Christmas lights, that's about it.<br /><br />The movie is rather dark with a muddy picture most of the time, at least on the videotape I watched.

{"value":"The Hills Have Eyes II is what you would expect it to be and nothing more. Of course it's not going to be an Oscar nominated film, it's just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for 90 minutes.<br /><br />The plot is basically about a group of National Guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert. It's just them fighting back throughout the whole film, which includes a lot of violence (which is basically the whole film) as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing, and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience.<br /><br />I'd give the Hills Have Eyes II 4 out of 10 for pure entertainment, and that only. Although even then I found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on, as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake.

{"value":"This is a truly wretched little film. Admittedly the original (un)holy trinity was governed by the law of diminishing returns with the third, \"The Final Conflict\" degenerating into a ridiculous sub-plot about half-way through the film apparently merely to provide the requisite needlessly convoluted deaths that had by now become the whole raison d'etre for the \"Omen\" series. But then to foist this jumped-up TV movie (beware purchasers of the Omen box set on DVD - don't be fooled by the widescreen ratio of the transfer, this was and is strictly small-screen stuff) on the back of a series of generally fine demonic chillers was unforgivable, particularly, endorsed as it was, by the exec.producer and producer of the first three movies Mace Neufeld and Harvey Bernhard. I'd give-away the plot if there was any, besides the usual death scenes (hopelessly toned down for TV sensibilities) and some of the worst acting I've seen. All involved in this project down to the catering people should be ashamed this travesty ever made it to the screen, let alone masquerading under the Omen name.

{"value":"This film had so much promise. I was very excited about this film. In the end, it was laughable at best, painful at worst. The acting styles ran the gamut from really, really, flat (the angels, the wife and daughter) to over-animated (Casper's character). I felt that the dialogue was just an attempt to transfer information to the audience instead of real people trying to talk to each other. Pay special attention to the scene regarding \"the bug\". It's pretty much an insult to the audience's ability to figure things out. In defense of that scene, though, it got the biggest laugh of the whole movie. I had read that they spent alot of money traveling to various overseas locations. Too bad they didn't make use of it. I didn't feel like I was transported to exotic locations. Anybody could insert stock footage of the Coliseum in Rome. However, to end on a positive note, I thought the sets were pretty good. I really liked the graphics that were displayed on the decoding computers. It is my opinion(and that's all it is) that if the SCHMALTZ factor would have been much much lower and the ACTION factor would have been greatly increased, this film would have been good.","finished_norm":["thi","film","have","so","much","promis","i","be","veri","excit","about","thi","film","in","the","end","it","be","laughabl","at","well","pain","at","wrong","the","act","styl","run","the","gamut","from","realli","realli","flat","the","angel","the","wife","and","daughter","to","overanim","casper","charact","i","feel","that","the","dialogu","be","just","a","attempt","to","transfer","inform","to","the","audienc","instead","of","real","peopl","try","to","talk","to","each","other","pai","special","attent","to","the","scene","regard","the","bug","it","pretti","much","a","insult","to","the","audienc","abil","to","figur","thing","out","in","defens","of","that","scene","though","it","get","the","big","laugh","of","the","whole","movi","i","have","read","that","thei","spend","alot","of","monei","travel","to","variou","oversea","locat","too","bad","thei","do","not","make","us","of","it","i","do","not","feel","like","i","be","transport","to","exot","locat","anybodi","can","insert","stock","footag","of","the","coliseum","in","rome","howev","to","end","on","a","posit","note","i","think","the","set","be","pretti","good","i","realli","like","the","graphic","that","be","displai","on","the","decod","comput","it","be","my","opinionand","that","all","it","be","that","if","the","schmaltz","factor","would","have","be","much","much","low","and","the","action","factor","would","have","be","greatli","increas","thi","film","would","have","be","good"],"filtered":["thi","film","much","promis","veri","excit","thi","film","end","laughabl","well","pain","wrong","act","styl","run","gamut","realli","realli","flat","angel","wife","daughter","overanim","casper","charact","feel","dialogu","attempt","transfer","inform","audienc","instead","real","peopl","try","talk","pai","special","attent","scene","regard","bug","pretti","much","insult","audienc","abil","figur","thing","defens","scene","though","get","big","laugh","whole","movi","read","thei","spend","alot","monei","travel","variou","oversea","locat","bad","thei","make","us","feel","like","transport","exot","locat","anybodi","insert","stock","footag","coliseum","rome","howev","end","posit","note","think","set","pretti","good","realli","like","graphic","displai","decod","comput","opinionand","schmaltz","factor","much","much","low","action","factor","greatli","increas","thi","film","good"],"filtered2":["promis","veri","excit","end","laughabl","well","pain","wrong","act","styl","run","gamut","realli","realli","flat","angel","wife","daughter","overanim","casper","charact","feel","dialogu","attempt","transfer","inform","audienc","instead","real","peopl","try","talk","pai","special","attent","scene","regard","bug","pretti","insult","audienc","abil","figur","thing","defens","scene","though","get","big","laugh","whole","read","spend","alot","monei","travel","variou","oversea","locat","bad","make","us","feel","like","transport","exot","locat","anybodi","insert","stock","footag","coliseum","rome","howev","end","posit","note","think","set","pretti","good","realli","like","graphic","displai","decod","comput","opinionand","schmaltz","factor","low","action","factor","greatli","increas","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,9,10,12,13,15,19,20,21,23,24,25,29,36,43,56,78,80,82,86,109,111,113,126,129,133,137,145,152,168,177,186,203,217,248,263,283,322,380,415,426,458,509,524,552,560,593,636,658,683,709,765,775,847,942,1019,1032,1036,1043,1063,1146,1209,1232,1572,2039,2187,2420,3015,3051,3266,3372,3493,3599,5776,6085,6639,7116],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,9,10,12,13,15,19,20,21,23,24,25,29,36,43,56,78,80,82,86,109,111,113,126,129,133,137,145,152,168,177,186,203,217,248,263,283,322,380,415,426,458,509,524,552,560,593,636,658,683,709,765,775,847,942,1019,1032,1036,1043,1063,1146,1209,1232,1572,2039,2187,2420,3015,3051,3266,3372,3493,3599,5776,6085,6639,7116],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,3.3953824709201923,1.2000607798565692,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,2.6420723132238515,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.4680183469605717,3.321622407243643,1.8610609350701788,4.012839573363895,1.9951803900462557,2.020196584395323,2.031112399272319,2.125691139326857,2.1183455303375887,2.1521782565202803,2.2391270689902285,2.4106958340079214,2.3212364753796515,2.2939035841256437,2.34599021453259,2.3131195476980753,4.978953423722071,2.458149992634611,2.571852579609833,2.569760528637609,2.6113665294700725,2.689504733779216,2.902686292364678,2.7678802023081546,2.885344817328191,3.102

{"value":"Edward Montagne's Tattooed Stranger is supposed to play like a crime thriller with a little film noir mixed in for flavor. Instead, it's a poorly acted, witless look into low budget and uninspired film making. The plot is absurd and the acting excruciatingly stiff and amateurish. John Miles, who had a rather thin resume in the industry, grins and guffaws throughout, and everyone else acts with the same verve as characters in a government-made filmstrip about driver safety. The movie anticipates shows like 'Leave it to Beaver' and 'Father Knows Best' in its unnaturally wholesome view of New York in 1950. Why, the viewer doesn't even get to see anyone light up a cig until some shapely woman is interviewed in a flophouse halfway through the movie. The only thing the movie has going for it (besides its brevity) is the excellent location shots coordinated by William Steiner. The low budget of the film works in the cinematographer's favor, as the viewer is treated to well-framed shots of New York City's interiors and expansive exteriors.

{"value":"Basically, \"Caprica\" is the Cylon origin story. The premise of the show is interesting. However, the writers follow so many story lines and clog it with too many POV characters that it bogs down the storytelling. The plot creeps at glacial speeds dissipating what tension it might have had.

Unfortunately, his only working prototype is driven by the AI version of his dead daughter Zoe, who died in a suicide bombing caused by Soldiers of the One (STO), an underground monotheist extremist group.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Joseph Adama (father of \"Battlestar Galactica\"'s Commander Adama) is struggling to hold his family together while searching for the AI version of his daughter (who also died in the bombing) in a Machiavellian virtual version of Caprica (which strongly resembles 1930s Chicago). <br /><br />In addition to the vapid writing, Caprica suffers from a similar problem as many origin stories. We already know how it ends (i.e. the Cylons develop their own civilization and rebel against humanity).","finished_norm":["basic","caprica","be","the","cylon","origin","stori","the","premis","of","the","show","be","interest","howev","the","writer","follow","so","mani","stori","line","and","clog","it","with","too","mani","pov","charact","that","it","bog","down","the","storytel","the","plot","creep","at","glacial","spe","dissip","what","tension","it","mai","have","have","in","ani","give","episod","littl","or","noth","happensbr","br","daniel","grayston","eric","stolz","be","a","militari","contractor","work","on","a","robot","soldier","us","a","steal","chip","unfortun","hi","onli","work","prototyp","be","drive","by","the","have","version","of","hi","dead","daughter","zoe","who","die","in","a","suicid","bomb","caus","by","soldier","of","the","on","sto","a","underground","monotheist","extremist","groupbr","br","meanwhil","joseph","adama","father","of","battlestar","galactica","command","adama","be","struggl","to","hold","hi","famili","togeth","while","search","for","the","have","version","of","hi","daughter","who","conjur","die","in","the","bomb","in","a","machiavellian","virtual","version","of","caprica","which","strongli","resembl","chicago","br","br","in","addit","to","the","vapid","write","caprica","suffer","from","a","similar","problem","a","mani","origin","stori","we","alreadi","know","how","it","end","ie","the","cylon","develop","their","own","civil","and","rebel","against","human"],"filtered":["basic","caprica","cylon","origin","stori","premis","show","interest","howev","writer","follow","mani","stori","line","clog","mani","pov","charact","bog","storytel","plot","creep","glacial","spe","dissip","tension","mai","ani","give","episod","littl","noth","happensbr","br","daniel","grayston","eric","stolz","militari","contractor","work","robot","soldier","us","steal","chip","unfortun","hi","onli","work","prototyp","drive","version","hi","dead","daughter","zoe","die","suicid","bomb","caus","soldier","sto","underground","monotheist","extremist","groupbr","br","meanwhil","joseph","adama","father","battlestar","galactica","command","adama","struggl","hold","hi","famili","togeth","search","version","hi","daughter","conjur","die","bomb","machiavellian","virtual","version","caprica","strongli","resembl","chicago","br","br","addit","vapid","write","caprica","suffer","similar","problem","mani","origin","stori","alreadi","know","end","ie","cylon","develop","civil","rebel","human"],"filtered2":["basic","caprica","cylon","origin","stori","premis","show","interest","howev","writer","follow","mani","stori","line","clog","mani","pov","charact","bog","storytel","plot","creep","glacial","spe","dissip","tension","mai","ani","give","littl","noth","happensbr","daniel","grayston","eric","stolz","militari","contractor","work","robot","soldier","us","steal","chip","unfortun","onli","work","prototyp","drive","version","dead","daughter","zoe","die","suicid","bomb","caus","soldier","sto","underground","monotheist","extremist","groupbr","meanwhil","joseph","adama","father","battlestar","galactica","command","adama","struggl","hold","famili","togeth","search","version","daughter","conjur","die","bomb","machiavellian","virtual","version","caprica","strongli","resembl","chicago","addit","vapid","write","caprica","suffer","similar","problem","mani","origin","stori","alreadi","know","end","ie","cylon","develop","civil","rebel","human"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,11,14,17,24,26,27,28,30,32,39,46,48,49,50,56,60,65,69,107,113,167,182,220,227,228,260,270,286,287,292,293,320,330,343,414,426,452,461,484,578,589,633,657,842,887,984,1053,1079,1089,1154,1185,1315,1373,1416,1429,1728,1772,1873,1991,2029,2110,2200,2217,2283,2341,3165,3943,4188,4287,4977,5204,5265,5714,6887,7177,8260,8549],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,11,14,17,24,26,27,28,30,32,39,46,48,49,50,56,60,65,69,107,113,167,182,220,227,228,260,270,286,287,292,293,320,330,343,414,426,452,461,484,578,589,633,657,842,887,984,1053,1079,1089,1154,1185,1315,1373,1416,1429,1728,1772,1873,1991,2029,2110,2200,2217,2283,2341,3165,3943,4188,4287,4977,5204,5265,5714,6887,7177,8260,8549],"values":[1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,3.83116108203179,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.655771293751733,3.3910232448024944,1.6920303308087352,5.153983156711065,1.8610609350701788,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,4.254065042302116,2.1439533986393955,2.1521782565202803,2.4609576687888097,2.7365296724240786,8.501080262633181,2.6005321873043625,2.7742700004069256,2.6754694156628323,2.731603554088023,2.780700890737216,2.8418901880819

{"value":"Spoiler!! I love Branagh, love Helena Bonham-Carter, loved them together in \"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein\" - but THIS -<br /><br />I can understand an actor's desire to stretch, to avoid the romantic stereotype. Well, they did, but really - the script droned on, Bonham-Carter's clothes were tres chic, and the occasional speeded-up \"madcap\" sequence could have been an outtake from a Beatles' movie, or the old Rowan and Martin Laugh-In.<br /><br />I never got the point - other commenters say the Branagh character was a dreamer. I never felt that. He was a loser, and not very bright, and certainly not endearing. The business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch. Certainly not amusing.<br /><br />Bonham-Carter's realistic (one supposes) attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of Lancashire accent in \"Full Monty.\"<br /><br />The poetic ending, with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated.

{"value":"Elephants Dream was supposed to be the flagship project of the open source community. And while it was a very interesting idea in concept, in reality it has failed miserably.<br /><br />The film is beautifully rendered, which is probably the only redeeming factor. A huge problem with them, however, is the vast overruse of light bloom. It's horrible, although I guess it helps give the film a dreamlike quality.<br /><br />One thing to note is the terrible voice acting. While Proog's voice actor is at least semi-competent, Emo's voice actor is HORRIBLE. I guess when you have a budget that basically amounts to zero, you can't afford to hire real voice actors. To me it seems like they hired one of the animators to do his voice.<br /><br />As a whole, the movie doesn't really go anywhere. To me it seems like it's more of a \"look what we can do\" kind of movie instead of a real film. The plot goes nowhere and fails at really showing any interesting point. The whole movie feels like it was made as an excuse to make interesting looking areas.<br /><br />Overall, it may be worth a quick download from the official site, but don't expect anything except

{"value":"I'm a huge Steven Seagal fan. Hell, I probably weigh as much as he does although I don't have the street cred to sport the frizzy-mullet-ponytail. Having stated my own bias and affection for America's favorite corpulent stage and screen hero, it is with a heavy heart that I must declare this to be his worst movie ever. I'm not sure he could make a movie any worse than this.<br /><br />In his defense the major problems with this film seem to occur in post-production. It's painfully obvious that this movie was supposed to have a different storyline. That results in woeful voiceovers in which Steve's voice doesn't nearly sync up with that of the dubbed voice. The editing is pisspoor and overall this starts bad, gets even worse, and by the end you'll wish you had rewatched The Da Vinci Code instead. Yes, it's that bad.<br /><br />After this I don't know what to expect from Steve. My friends still laugh at me for listening to his CDs. Is it time I start checking out some of the Van Damme direct to DVD nutty logs? If you are tempted to watch this movie, rip your eyeballs out and flush them down the toilet.

{"value":"This \"film\" attempts to follow the genre of low budget, hand-held camera flicks that have proved to be very effective and successful.<br /><br />This one, fails, and HOW.<br /><br />It's amazing how many so called \"awards\" this piece of garbage has got plastered on the cover..... it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they actually submitted this....<br /><br />Words fail to describe just how absolutely appalling this movie really is. Seriously, it's THAT BAD.<br /><br />I watched it in 20 minutes flat, on almost continual fast forward.<br /><br />From rubbish lighting to dreadful directing, grainy visuals to muffled sound, and of course not forgetting the ABYSMAL acting, this was one completely and utterly pathetic piece of so-called film making.<br /><br />It seriously, has NO redeeming qualities - whatsoever. Save your cash and watch a decent low budget horror flick, there are plenty out there - Dead End, The Blair Witch, REC, to name but a few.<br /><br />AVOID this rubbish at all costs.

{"value":"What a waste of time! I've tried to sit through 'Sky Captain..\" about 6 times, and every time, within about 3 minutes, I start doing something else - anything else! It's a downright boring movie, the acting is terrible, the writing dull, and obviously a first-time director, because it's stiff. And I wanted to love it. I love sci-fi, the old cliffhangers, and I can appreciate the attempt at nods to Flash Gordon, and Metropolis, but my God, what a waste of money. I used to work for Paramount Pictures, and I had written Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests. She told me they'd never have an interest or need to do it. 10 years later, Paramount releases this piece of crap. Sherry was right in 1993, but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog. Blue screen an effect shot, but not an entire movie. Let's not forget, neither Jude nor Jolie are terrific actors (but easy on the eyes). Paltrow's performance reminds me of a high school effort. Too bad - it could've worked, but only under a skilled director. the funny thing is, Sky Captain's director will keep getting work, even after this dreck.

{"value":"If there has ever been a worse comedy than 'Gray Matters' I am unaware of it. The New York Jewish comedy's 'funny' premise is that siblings Sam & Gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix Sam up with a girlfriend, only to find that Gray is equally attracted to their target - Charlie. The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her. There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence, a deeply embarrassing 'drunk act' from Moynahan and Graham, and a performance that would embarrass forests everywhere for its woodenness from Tom Cavanagh. Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this excised from her resume. Molly Shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance. Only Alan Cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously under-employed and given nothing with which to work. The whole disaster is cemented by Graham's bizarre eye-rolling performance culminating with the penultimate scene where she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar. It is astonishing that this film was ever released it has no redeeming feature and should be avoided at all costs.","finished_norm":["if","there","have","ever","be","a","wrong","comedi","than","grai","matter","i","be","unawar","of","it","the","new","york","jewish","comedi","funni","premis","be","that","sibl","sam","grai","be","mistak","for","a","coupl","and","so","decid","to","fix","sam","up","with","a","girlfriend","onli","to","find","that","grai","be","equal","attract","to","their","target","charli","the","revel","that","grai","be","secretli","gai","be","appar","onli","a","surpris","to","her","there","be","a","deepli","offens","wed","sequenc","a","deepli","embarrass","drink","act","from","moynahan","and","graham","and","a","perform","that","would","embarrass","forest","everywher","for","it","wooden","from","tom","cavanagh","sissi","spacek","demonstr","a","complet","inabl","to","do","comedi","and","will","want","thi","excis","from","her","resum","molli","shannon","plai","the","home","friend","with","lumpen","insouci","onli","alan","cum","emerg","with","ani","credit","but","be","serious","underemploi","and","give","noth","with","which","to","work","the","whole","disast","be","cement","by","graham","bizarr","eyerol","perform","culmin","with","the","penultim","scene","where","she","wear","a","comedi","hat","and","a","overcoat","despit","the","scene","be","set","in","a","lesbian","bar","it","be","astonish","that","thi","film","be","ever","releas","it","have","no","redeem","featur","and","should","be","avoid","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["ever","wrong","comedi","grai","matter","unawar","new","york","jewish","comedi","funni","premis","sibl","sam","grai","mistak","coupl","decid","fix","sam","girlfriend","onli","find","grai","equal","attract","target","charli","revel","grai","secretli","gai","appar","onli","surpris","deepli","offens","wed","sequenc","deepli","embarrass","drink","act","moynahan","graham","perform","embarrass","forest","everywher","wooden","tom","cavanagh","sissi","spacek","demonstr","complet","inabl","comedi","want","thi","excis","resum","molli","shannon","plai","home","friend","lumpen","insouci","onli","alan","cum","emerg","ani","credit","serious","underemploi","give","noth","work","whole","disast","cement","graham","bizarr","eyerol","perform","culmin","penultim","scene","wear","comedi","hat","overcoat","despit","scene","set","lesbian","bar","astonish","thi","film","ever","releas","redeem","featur","avoid","cost"],"filtered2":["ever","wrong","comedi","grai","matter","unawar","new","york","jewish","comedi","funni","premis","sibl","sam","grai","mistak","coupl","decid","fix","sam","girlfriend","onli","find","grai","equal","attract","target","charli","revel","grai","secretli","gai","appar","onli","surpris","deepli","offens","wed","sequenc","deepli","embarrass","drink","act","moynahan","graham","perform","embarrass","forest","everywher","wooden","tom","cavanagh","sissi","spacek","demonstr","complet","inabl","comedi","want","excis","resum","molli","shannon","plai","home","friend","lumpen","insouci","onli","alan","cum","emerg","ani","credit","serious","underemploi","give","noth","work","whole","disast","cement","graham","bizarr","eyerol","perform","culmin","penultim","scene","wear","comedi","hat","overcoat","despit","scene","set","lesbian","bar","astonish","ever","releas","redeem","featur","avoid","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[11,19,21,25,27,30,37,38,40,44,48,49,62,87,103,105,109,111,127,161,249,253,302,305,308,326,327,335,349,356,371,391,484,514,556,592,634,640,648,667,730,759,823,827,836,891,906,1034,1058,1070,1145,1239,1271,1489,1497,1604,1637,1686,1732,1817,2010,2115,2117,2182,2197,2258,2319,3093,3176,3701,3968,4012,4110,4391,4735,4736,5192,5491,5754,6302],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[11,19,21,25,27,30,37,38,40,44,48,49,62,87,103,105,109,111,127,161,249,253,302,305,308,326,327,335,349,356,371,391,484,514,556,592,634,640,648,667,730,759,823,827,836,891,906,1034,1058,1070,1145,1239,1271,1489,1497,1604,1637,1686,1732,1817,2010,2115,2117,2182,2197,2258,2319,3093,3176,3701,3968,4012,4110,4391,4735,4736,5192,5491,5754,6302],"values":[2.9739294460164585,2.62476135602347,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,3.209458785004948,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,2.0226120445069267,2.115024371522662,2.098582041218749,4.353122425996981,2.125691139326857,2.1183455303375887,9.743871748434547,2.4323182980210873,2.6754694156628323,2.7073305177318163,2.902686292364678,2.8612813773965557,2.8753661172782943,2.942840385588056,2.9674191958529437,2.908534262247101,3.0568369721919364,3.028335462059722,3.0466846007279185,3.109204957709252,3.291526514503207,3.4052853998

{"value":"In the last 10 years I have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations, managed many pro wrestlers (including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars), worked on 2 different wrestling TV programs and did voice-overs and commentary for many wrestling DVD's. I have NEVER witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity, lack of talent and skill, and shoddy production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling. To even list this as a wrestling video of ANY kind is an outright misuse of the term. Shot with low-dollar video cameras, it's essentially home videos of kids play-fighting in back yards. The sound quality is bad, the video quality is bad, and the acting is horrendous. The \"wrestlers\" wear makeshift costumes with hand-drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves. Sometimes the \"matches\" are on the grass. Sometimes on a back yard trampoline. ALL are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill. In short, don't bother with this stinker.

{"value":"Oh, this is so bad, it is funny. The only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun. I mean: you get to see porn actresses topless, having sex, then killed by human mutants. There is plenty of gore, including the classic \"something is wrong with her, oh no, it's half the person she used to be\" and the accidental murder caused by panic. But you can also find funny stuff like intestines pulled through someone's ass and a guy running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees (that makes a metallic doiiing sound afterward, like in cartoons). Somehow there is a market for people going beyond porn, they really need to know what's inside an actress, mere genitals are not enough. Therefore you get to see plenty of summary autopsies on slain bimbos. There is NO dialog. Jenna and Chasey have really small parts and I really wonder what Richard Grieco wanted when accepting a role here. I think this is a film one must watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the juicy stuff, just to be reminded of the old school C class horror

{"value":"The Honey, I Shrunk the Kids franchise was a huge deal and not to mention very famous. I loved Honey, I shrunk the Kids when I was little. It was an original story and had such an exciting plot! The sets were so amazing and the cast seemed like they enjoyed each other's company. Now Honey, I blew up the kid was pretty stupid, so I think they wanted to go back to the story that everyone loved.<br /><br />Basically, Adam is a little more grown up now and the mom's are going on vacation to leave their husbands with their children. But when Wayne's favorite item is threatened for the garbage, he wants to shrink it and keep it, but he and his brother get in the way. But when the wives come back after forgetting to give some meds to their son, they get caught in the machine as well, leaving the kids in the house alone!<br /><br />The plot is silly, but like I said, it was just a family film that I think some might get a kick out of. The original Honey, I Shrunk the Kids is the best, I think everyone could agree. The third one wasn't so bad, I would recommend this one at least over Honey, I Blew Up the Kid movie, it was at least a little more fun.<br /><br

{"value":"It's obvious that all of the good reviews posted for this movie so far are from insiders who were either involved with the film or who know somebody who knows somebody and have thus seen multiple cuts. Well, I don't know anyone involved, and I've seen the final cut, and it is pure garbage. The only thing it has going for it is ambition and multiple cameos from horror legends (none on screen for terribly long). It's as if the filmmakers made this movie on a weekend during a horror convention and got actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess and Michael Berryman to film scenes during their coffee breaks. This is an ultra-cheap, shot-on-video wannabe X-Files with terrible acting from a cast of non-actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or no action; it's all overly explanatory dialogue that attempts to explain a pointlessly convoluted plot. Ther computer FX are a joke, but there aren't enough of them nor enough action to make this film enjoyable in a MST3K way. After about 8 straight scenes of nothing but talking, you'll find yourself reaching for the fast-forward button...and not letting go.

{"value":"I got this as a turkey movie and was I not disappointed.<br /><br />Acting - overall even though many have been in other movies it is clear that they had to work hard to act this bad so constantly over this entire movie with out accidentally letting slip some degree of acting.<br /><br />Plot - being generous I could say that the scriptwriter did originally start with a plot but but did his best to ignore it. the plot broke down faster then a Chinese knock off computer <br /><br />Scrip - now that was an abomination of nature. it failed to flow with any rhyme or reason. the majority of the lines by the characters were at best pathetic to imbecilic. the script worked hard to make sure that no character managed to get to be considered memorable. I have watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable.<br /><br />Special effects - ROTFLMAO!!!!!

{"value":"\"Laugh, Clown Laugh\" released in 1928, stars the legendary Lon Chaney as a circus clown named Tito. Tito has raised a foundling (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and names her Simonetta. Tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not get past the fact that Tito, now well into middle age, has the hots for the young Simonetta. Although he is not her biological father, he has raised her like a daughter. That kind of \"ick\" factor permeates throughout the film. Tito competes for Simonetta's affections with a young and handsome 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilt about abandoning Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the film tells Tito what a stupid old fool he is being (until he reveals it himself at the end). The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young, who would go on to have a great career.

{"value":"This may not be the very worst movie Peter Sellers ever did (I think that laurel goes to \"The Prisoner of Zenda\") but it is surely the most depressing. Sellers, especially sans makeup as Nayland Smith, looks like he has just undergone chemotherapy. As Fu Manchu, he looks hardly better and spends most of the film (with the exception of those strangely disturbing scenes where he gets jolted with electrical currents) on the verge of collapsing under the weight of all that makeup. The supporting players also look tired and run down, and Sid Caeser's presence is offensive even without his constant references to \"Chinks!\" (One bright spot: this would be one of the last times a major motion picture would portray Asians so insultingly ... or, for that matter, star a non-Asian as one!). The film seems surprisingly cheap, with soupy photography and drab sets - even the whiz-bang Elvis number at the end looks cut-rate. Only the stunning Helen Mirren and the tall, thin, nervous guy who get his pants wet add any sparks of life to this sad affair. All in all, this film provides an eerie premonition of a great comic's death, and an even eerier documentation of his dying.","finished_norm":["thi","mai","not","be","the","veri","wrong","movi","peter","seller","ever","do","i","think","that","laurel","go","to","the","prison","of","zenda","but","it","be","sure","the","much","depress","seller","especi","san","makeup","a","nayland","smith","look","like","he","have","just","undergo","chemotherapi","a","fu","manchu","he","look","hardli","well","and","spend","much","of","the","film","with","the","except","of","that","strang","disturb","scene","where","he","get","jolt","with","electr","current","on","the","verg","of","collaps","under","the","weight","of","all","that","makeup","the","support","player","conjur","look","tire","and","run","down","and","sid","caeser","presenc","be","offens","even","without","hi","constant","refer","to","chink","on","bright","spot","thi","would","be","on","of","the","last","time","a","major","motion","pictur","would","portrai","asian","so","insultingli","or","for","that","matt","star","a","nonasian","a","on","the","film","seem","surprisingli","cheap","with","soupi","photographi","and","drab","set","even","the","whizbang","elvi","numb","at","the","end","look","cutrat","onli","the","stun","helen","mirren","and","the","tall","thin","nervou","gui","who","get","hi","pant","wet","add","ani","spark","of","life","to","thi","sad","affair","all","in","all","thi","film","provid","a","eeri","premonit","of","a","great","comic","death","and","a","even","eeri","document","of","hi","dye"],"filtered":["thi","mai","veri","wrong","movi","peter","seller","ever","think","laurel","go","prison","zenda","sure","much","depress","seller","especi","san","makeup","nayland","smith","look","like","undergo","chemotherapi","fu","manchu","look","hardli","well","spend","much","film","except","strang","disturb","scene","get","jolt","electr","current","verg","collaps","weight","makeup","support","player","conjur","look","tire","run","sid","caeser","presenc","offens","even","without","hi","constant","refer","chink","bright","spot","thi","last","time","major","motion","pictur","portrai","asian","insultingli","matt","star","nonasian","film","seem","surprisingli","cheap","soupi","photographi","drab","set","even","whizbang","elvi","numb","end","look","cutrat","onli","stun","helen","mirren","tall","thin","nervou","gui","get","hi","pant","wet","add","ani","spark","life","thi","sad","affair","thi","film","provid","eeri","premonit","great","comic","death","even","eeri","document","hi","dye"],"filtered2":["mai","veri","wrong","peter","seller","ever","think","laurel","go","prison","zenda","sure","depress","seller","especi","san","makeup","nayland","smith","look","like","undergo","chemotherapi","fu","manchu","look","hardli","well","spend","except","strang","disturb","scene","get","jolt","electr","current","verg","collaps","weight","makeup","support","player","conjur","look","tire","run","sid","caeser","presenc","offens","even","without","constant","refer","chink","bright","spot","last","time","major","motion","pictur","portrai","asian","insultingli","matt","star","nonasian","seem","surprisingli","cheap","soupi","photographi","drab","set","even","whizbang","elvi","numb","end","look","cutrat","onli","stun","helen","mirren","tall","thin","nervou","gui","get","pant","wet","add","ani","spark","life","sad","affair","provid","eeri","premonit","great","comic","death","even","eeri","document","dye"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,6,8,11,12,15,16,19,20,24,25,27,35,39,44,46,51,55,75,100,109,119,125,137,144,232,245,267,283,299,311,351,404,408,417,455,459,469,480,516,665,695,715,760,839,852,900,960,980,999,1005,1021,1075,1145,1159,1201,1230,1329,1360,1372,1398,1421,1458,1528,1556,1848,2230,2248,2384,2432,2433,2466,2536,2600,3078,3082,3275,3564,3825,3915,4018,4920,4941,4984,5462,7370,7397],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,6,8,11,12,15,16,19,20,24,25,27,35,39,44,46,51,55,75,100,109,119,125,137,144,232,245,267,283,299,311,351,404,408,417,455,459,469,480,516,665,695,715,760,839,852,900,960,980,999,1005,1021,1075,1145,1159,1201,1230,1329,1360,1372,1398,1421,1458,1528,1556,1848,2230,2248,2384,2432,2433,2466,2536,2600,3078,3082,3275,3564,3825,3915,4018,4920,4941,4984,5462,7370,7397],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.5932680941439847,2.7780513171783934,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,4.786455488116434,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,1.9536997889255368,1.9742250248702675,2.1405462403177813,2.125691139326857,2.1653

{"value":"this movie was banned in england? why? tom savini, george romero, dario argento, lucio fulci and others had done far worse before and have continued to so since...<br /><br />this movie has all the basic elements of a decent 70s or early 80's horror film. good looking girls (who can't act to save their lives, by the way), a terrible lightning storm with a torrential downpour, a scythe, a crazy brother wandering around the family estate, and actually a pretty damn good twist at the end. but banned? seriously. when the English parliament banned this movie, the italians probably laughed their collective asses off at how backwards and prudish the brits really were.<br /><br />there was maybe two minutes of total screen time devoted to the violence and gore (which was greatly underdone). there was nudity but no sex although allusions to sex were made, obviously. but absolutely nothing worthy of being banned.<br /><br />i would like to see what could have been done if the filmmakers had a decent budget to work with. as it stands, the film is entertaining, but the lack of picture and sound quality take away from the end result.<br /><br />banned... what a

{"value":"I had several problems with the movie: <br /><br />(1) The screenplay -- specifically, Kim Basinger's voice over: Movies are not books; they should *show* the action rather than have a voice over *tell* us what's happening. Occasionally I find a movie with a voice over that works, but here it seemed more of a lazy way of writing the script. In fact, it sounded to me as if she was practically reading excerpts from the novel in her voice over.<br /><br />(2) I felt no emotion in the relationship between Jessie and Brother Thomas and also felt that Alex Carter's acting was pretty bad. That's a significant failure for me in defining Jessie's and Thomas' characters -- with no connection between them, it seemed to me as if she just wanted a stud and that for him it was a matter of being sex-deprived. If it had been properly done, the relationship between them would have given much more context to the story.<br /><br />(3) With the book, I understood Jessie's mid-life crisis. In the movie, it seemed more like just plain boredom.<br /><br />On the plus side, I didn't think the movie was so bad as for me to turn off the TV . . . though that thought did occur to
