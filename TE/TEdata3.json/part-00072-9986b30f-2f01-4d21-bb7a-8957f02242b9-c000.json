{"value":"I get the feeling that the producers of this mess were out to make the most painful, ridiculous Western ever made. \"PAINFUL\" is the best word I can think of to describe it.<br /><br />On the plus side you have nice color photography and beautiful and well-spoken Rhonda Fleming. My sympathy goes to Jacques Aubuchon (who played the cripple), who acted well enough in an annoying role, written so atrociously that no actor could give an enjoyable performance. The production values were quite good, which only served to highlight the terrible story and screenplay.<br /><br />Things I hated: Stewart Granger looked so little like a western figure, what with his British accent, neat tailored outfit, and silly immaculate always-white kerchief tied around his neck. It got tiresome the way the townspeople and his son were constantly haranguing and insulting Granger, and he never spoke up or replied back. I know we are supposed to suspend disbelief and appreciate Westerns as symbolic morality plays, but this one broke the spell with it laughably unrealistic and predictable scenes, the worst being at the end where Granger miraculously, speedily and single-handedly plants dynamite around a canyon pass that the bad guy's cattle will pass through, and then Granger plants himself in the perfect spot so he can shoot the dynamite from a very far distance to create rock slides to bury and spook the cattle and bad guys, seemingly destroying them all, save the two main bad guys. Next worst is everything about the plot, which is loaded with soap opera scenes. Nothing in the movie seemed believable: I couldn't believe what all the conflict was about. The bad guy was driving his herd through to market and wanted the cows to chew some grass along the way; I don't see why something couldn't have been worked out. You need a land ownership dispute for that? Don't bother to see it.","finished_norm":["i","get","the","feel","that","the","produc","of","thi","mess","be","out","to","make","the","much","pain","ridicul","western","ever","make","pain","be","the","well","word","i","can","think","of","to","describ","itbr","br","on","the","plu","side","you","have","nice","color","photographi","and","beauti","and","wellspoken","rhonda","fleme","my","sympathi","go","to","jacqu","aubuchon","who","plai","the","crippl","who","act","good","enough","in","a","annoi","role","write","so","atroci","that","no","actor","can","give","a","enjoy","perform","the","product","valu","be","quit","good","which","onli","serv","to","highlight","the","terribl","stori","and","screenplaybr","br","thing","i","hate","stewart","granger","look","so","littl","like","a","western","figur","what","with","hi","british","accent","neat","tailor","outfit","and","silli","immacul","alwayswhit","kerchief","tie","around","hi","neck","it","get","tiresom","the","wai","the","townspeopl","and","hi","son","be","constantli","harangu","and","insult","granger","and","he","never","speak","up","or","repli","back","i","know","we","be","suppos","to","suspend","disbelief","and","appreci","western","a","symbol","moral","plai","but","thi","on","break","the","spell","with","it","laughabl","unrealist","and","predict","scene","the","wrong","be","at","the","end","where","granger","miracul","speedili","and","singlehandedli","plant","dynamit","around","a","canyon","pass","that","the","bad","gui","cattl","will","pass","through","and","then","granger","plant","himself","in","the","perfect","spot","so","he","can","shoot","the","dynamit","from","a","veri","far","distanc","to","creat","rock","slide","to","buri","and","spook","the","cattl","and","bad","gui","seemingli","destroi","them","all","save","the","two","main","bad","gui","next","wrong","be","everyth","about","the","plot","which","be","load","with","soap","opu","scene","noth","in","the","movi","seem","believ","i","can","not","believ","what","all","the","conflict","be","about","the","bad","gui","be","drive","hi","herd","through","to","market","and","want","the","cow","to","chew","some","grass","along","the","wai","i","do","not","see","why","someth","can","not","have","be","work","out","you","ne","a","land","ownership","disput","for","that","do","not","bother","to","see","it"],"filtered":["get","feel","produc","thi","mess","make","much","pain","ridicul","western","ever","make","pain","well","word","think","describ","itbr","br","plu","side","nice","color","photographi","beauti","wellspoken","rhonda","fleme","sympathi","go","jacqu","aubuchon","plai","crippl","act","good","enough","annoi","role","write","atroci","actor","give","enjoy","perform","product","valu","quit","good","onli","serv","highlight","terribl","stori","screenplaybr","br","thing","hate","stewart","granger","look","littl","like","western","figur","hi","british","accent","neat","tailor","outfit","silli","immacul","alwayswhit","kerchief","tie","around","hi","neck","get","tiresom","wai","townspeopl","hi","son","constantli","harangu","insult","granger","never","speak","repli","back","know","suppos","suspend","disbelief","appreci","western","symbol","moral","plai","thi","break","spell","laughabl","unrealist","predict","scene","wrong","end","granger","miracul","speedili","singlehandedli","plant","dynamit","around","canyon","pass","bad","gui","cattl","pass","granger","plant","perfect","spot","shoot","dynamit","veri","far","distanc","creat","rock","slide","buri","spook","cattl","bad","gui","seemingli","destroi","save","two","main","bad","gui","next","wrong","everyth","plot","load","soap","opu","scene","noth","movi","seem","believ","believ","conflict","bad","gui","drive","hi","herd","market","want","cow","chew","grass","along","wai","see","someth","work","ne","land","ownership","disput","bother","see"],"filtered2":["get","feel","produc","mess","make","pain","ridicul","western","ever","make","pain","well","word","think","describ","itbr","plu","side","nice","color","photographi","beauti","wellspoken","rhonda","fleme","sympathi","go","jacqu","aubuchon","plai","crippl","act","good","enough","annoi","role","write","atroci","actor","give","enjoy","perform","product","valu","quit","good","onli","serv","highlight","terribl","stori","screenplaybr","thing","hate","stewart","granger","look","littl","like","western","figur","british","accent","neat","tailor","outfit","silli","immacul","alwayswhit","kerchief","tie","around","neck","get","tiresom","wai","townspeopl","son","constantli","harangu","insult","granger","never","speak","repli","back","know","suppos","suspend","disbelief","appreci","western","symbol","moral","plai","break","spell","laughabl","unrealist","predict","scene","wrong","end","granger","miracul","speedili","singlehandedli","plant","dynamit","around","canyon","pass","bad","gui","cattl","pass","granger","plant","perfect","spot","shoot","dynamit","veri","far","distanc","creat","rock","slide","buri","spook","cattl","bad","gui","seemingli","destroi","sa

{"value":"Earlier today I got into an argument on why so many people complain about modern films in which I encountered a curious statement: \"the character development in newer movies just isn't nearly as good or interesting as it used to be.\" Depending on the film(s) in question, this can be attributed to a number of things, sometimes generic special effects and plot-driven Hollywood garbage like War Of The Worlds, but in the case of over-the-top, uninteresting attempts at social commentary and a desperate struggle to put \"art\" back into cinema, it's movies like Dog Days that are to blame.<br /><br />I normally have a very high tolerance for movies, no matter how dull or pointless I find them (ranging from good, long ones like Andrei Rublev and Dogville, to ones I've considered painful to sit through a la Alpha Dog and Wild Wild West). I shut this movie off 45 minutes in, which is 30 minutes more than I actually should have. I wasn't interested in any of the characters whatsoever and found nothing substantial beyond a thin veil of unfocused pessimism. In an attempt to say something about the dregs of society, this film too easily falls into being self-indulgent, trite, and exploitative in a very sincere sense. Granted, I've seen many disturbing movies on the same subject, but there are so many better films out there about depressing, pathetic people (Happiness, Gummo, Kids, Salo, Storytelling, Irreversible) that actually contain characters of great emotional depth and personality. Dog Days had none more than an eighth grader's distaste for society, choosing to ignore any true intelligence about the way people actually are, and instead choosing to be a dull, awful, and hopelessly unoriginal attempt at a work of \"art.\" This isn't a characterization of the unknown or a clever observation into the dregs of society, it's just boring and nothing worth caring about.","finished_norm":["earli","todai","i","get","into","a","argum","on","why","so","mani","peopl","complain","about","modern","film","in","which","i","encount","a","curiou","statem","the","charact","develop","in","new","movi","just","be","not","nearli","a","good","or","interest","a","it","us","to","be","depend","on","the","film","in","question","thi","can","be","attribut","to","a","numb","of","thing","sometim","gener","special","effect","and","plotdriven","hollywood","garbag","like","war","of","the","world","but","in","the","case","of","overthetop","uninterest","attempt","at","social","commentari","and","a","desper","struggl","to","put","art","back","into","cinema","it","movi","like","dog","dai","that","be","to","blamebr","br","i","normal","have","a","veri","high","toler","for","movi","no","matt","how","dull","or","pointless","i","find","them","rang","from","good","long","on","like","andrei","rublev","and","dogvil","to","on","i","have","consid","pain","to","sit","through","a","la","alpha","dog","and","wild","wild","west","i","shut","thi","movi","off","minut","in","which","be","minut","much","than","i","actual","should","have","i","be","not","interest","in","ani","of","the","charact","whatsoev","and","find","noth","substanti","beyond","a","thin","veil","of","unfocus","pessim","in","a","attempt","to","sai","someth","about","the","dreg","of","societi","thi","film","too","easili","fall","into","be","selfindulg","trite","and","exploit","in","a","veri","sincer","sens","grant","i","have","see","mani","disturb","movi","on","the","same","subject","but","there","be","so","mani","well","film","out","there","about","depress","pathet","peopl","happi","gummo","kid","salo","storytel","irrevers","that","actual","contain","charact","of","great","emot","depth","and","person","dog","dai","have","none","much","than","a","grader","distast","for","societi","choos","to","ignor","ani","true","intellig","about","the","wai","peopl","actual","be","and","instead","choos","to","be","a","dull","aw","and","hopelessli","unorigin","attempt","at","a","work","of","art","thi","be","not","a","character","of","the","unknown","or","a","clever","observ","into","the","dreg","of","societi","it","just","bore","and","noth","worth","care","about"],"filtered":["earli","todai","get","argum","mani","peopl","complain","modern","film","encount","curiou","statem","charact","develop","new","movi","nearli","good","interest","us","depend","film","question","thi","attribut","numb","thing","sometim","gener","special","effect","plotdriven","hollywood","garbag","like","war","world","case","overthetop","uninterest","attempt","social","commentari","desper","struggl","put","art","back","cinema","movi","like","dog","dai","blamebr","br","normal","veri","high","toler","movi","matt","dull","pointless","find","rang","good","long","like","andrei","rublev","dogvil","consid","pain","sit","la","alpha","dog","wild","wild","west","shut","thi","movi","minut","minut","much","actual","interest","ani","charact","whatsoev","find","noth","substanti","beyond","thin","veil","unfocus","pessim","attempt","sai","someth","dreg","societi","thi","film","easili","fall","selfindulg","trite","exploit","veri","sincer","sens","grant","see","mani","disturb","movi","subject","mani","well","film","depress","pathet","peopl","happi","gummo","kid","salo","storytel","irrevers","actual","contain","charact","great","emot","depth","person","dog","dai","none","much","grader","distast","societi","choos","ignor","ani","true","intellig","wai","peopl","actual","instead","choos","dull","aw","hopelessli","unorigin","attempt","work","art","thi","character","unknown","clever","observ","dreg","societi","bore","noth","worth","care"],"filtered2":["earli","todai","get","argum","mani","peopl","complain","modern","encount","curiou","statem","charact","develop","new","nearli","good","interest","us","depend","question","attribut","numb","thing","sometim","gener","special","effect","plotdriven","hollywood","garbag","like","war","world","case","overthetop","uninterest","attempt","social","commentari","desper","struggl","put","art","back","cinema","like","dog","dai","blamebr","normal","veri","high","toler","matt","dull","pointless","find","rang","good","long","like","andrei","rublev","dogvil","consid","pain","sit","la","alpha","dog","wild","wild","west","shut","minut","minut","actual","interest","ani","charact","whatsoev","find","noth","substanti","beyond","thin","veil","unfocus","pessim","attempt","someth","dreg","societi","easili","fall","selfindulg","trite","exploit","veri","sincer","sens","grant","see","mani","disturb","subject","mani","well","depress","pathet","peopl","happi","gummo","kid","salo","storytel","irrevers","actual","contain","charact","great","emot","depth","person","dog","dai","none","grader","distast","societi","choos","ignor","ani","true","intellig","wai","peopl","actual","instead","choos","dull","aw","hopelessli","unorigin","attempt","work","art","character","unknown","clever","observ","dreg","societi"

{"value":"This movie is not as horrible as most Sci-Fi Channel movies. I am used to seeing the gray CGI blobs and the amateurish special effects such as close-ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation. However, I had thought that I had seen all the possible lows that the Sci-Fi Channel could hit. Then I saw this movie.<br /><br />Imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup? Those are the main Alien Vampires in this movie. You can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets. A talking hand comes out of the guts of victims, and the Vampire who is on the Vampire Hunter's team can talk to these Rubber Sock puppets in Transylvanian. How did Alien Vampires learn Transylvanian? And isn't Transylvania in Romania? So shouldn't they be talking Romanian? Why would some little town have their own language? If you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks with the fingers clearly moving inside the Aliens' heads; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires. There are the \"Leatherfaces\" who like to wear the faces of their victims. Then there are the just plain ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars. Then there are the annoying Valley Girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the Defense Systems so that these Space Vampires can attack.<br /><br />Finally, if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh, you have to deal with the third rate cast of Network TV rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves. Why does almost every Sci-Fi Channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying, abrasive, crude, or just totally unsympathetic? I found myself hoping the talking rubber socks would

{"value":"What on earth has become of our dear Ramu? Is this the same man who made Sarkar, Satya, and Comapny? I refuse to believe so. If AAG was Ramu's most ambitious project, he has clearly jumped off the high cliff he has ascended by giving the industry some of the greatest works of all times. This movie is made to fall like a brick. I was cringing to leave the theater, but I was forced to sit because I wouldn't have been able to take my car out of the parking lot before others also left. Else, nothing would have made me sit beyond interval.<br /><br />This movie is nowhere close to Sholay. It doesn't even come near it within a mile. I believe Ramu surely loves The Godfather more than Sholay, since Sarkar was a classic piece of work. I read Ramu's interview a couple of days back, in which the interviewer said that Ramu doesn't sleep for more than 4 hours a day, that too not at a stretch. I completely agree with this now, as his lack of sleep has probably taken its toll on the movie.<br /><br />There is no power in the performance. Amitabh Bachchan doesn't even look scary. He looked more terrifying in the few posters and wallpapers I saw earlier. Ramu's favorite Nisha Kothari did a fantastic job in Sarkar because she didn't have many dialogs (in fact none if I remember clearly). She opened her mouth in this movie, and has found a place in history. The new guy playing Jai's role seems to have that brash look, but didn't manage Jai's role at all. I cant go on... Im sorry... my pain is too big for me to manage right now.<br /><br />I promised myself throughout the movie that I will watch the original Sholay once more just to see that it is still there.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Horrible movie. The media and critics are going to cook Ramu's goose. And just to remind all readers once more, I am one of the biggest Ramu fans, and even I cant spare him for this

{"value":"Bo Derek's debut film remained unseen for eight years  and that's how it should stayed! John Derek was a competent actor but, as a director, he's virtually the Ed Wood of erotic cinema  not that this is especially explicit, considering that Bo (atypically sporting dark hair) was only 16 when the film was made! John also wrote and photographed it; the latter results in some decent footage of the Greek island setting against which the narrative is set  but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious! <br /><br />The character played by male lead Peter Hooten has been brought up with Bo's family: they grew up as brother and sister but, now in their teens, the couple discover they're attracted to one another (but, as I said, don't expect any sexual fireworks!). Still, the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness  Hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized sea-side resort and keeps expecting a cruise-liner to appear into view (which, of course, it does at the finale); Derek's is even nuttier  she craves possession of a large antique bath-tub!! For the record, the couple are married by the end of the film.<br /><br />Also involved in the non-events are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of Bo (and who, naturally, incurs the wrath of the jealous Hooten). Occasionally, for no very good reason, we're even treated to snippets from the screening of old Hollywood classics in an open-air movie house to which the whole town assembles (among the titles shown is THE PUBLIC ENEMY [1931])! At the end of the day, while Bo's naivete throughout is undeniably charming, it's not enough to offset the film's overwhelming dullness and amateurishness.","finished_norm":["bo","derek","debut","film","remain","unseen","for","eight","year","and","that","how","it","should","stai","john","derek","be","a","compet","actor","but","a","a","director","he","virtual","the","ed","wood","of","erot","cinema","not","that","thi","be","especi","explicit","consid","that","bo","atyp","sport","dark","hair","be","onli","when","the","film","be","make","john","conjur","write","and","photograph","it","the","latter","result","in","some","decent","footag","of","the","greek","island","set","against","which","the","narr","be","set","but","the","plot","be","pueril","and","the","dialogu","atroci","br","br","the","charact","plai","by","male","lead","peter","hooten","have","be","bring","up","with","bo","famili","thei","grow","up","a","brother","and","sister","but","now","in","their","teen","the","coupl","discov","thei","re","attract","to","on","anoth","but","a","i","sai","do","not","expect","ani","sexual","firework","still","the","wrong","thing","about","thi","be","the","fact","that","the","protagonist","each","harbor","a","obsess","all","through","the","film","which","be","not","onli","silli","in","themselv","but","irrit","in","their","relentless","hooten","want","to","turn","the","remot","fish","commun","into","a","modern","seasid","resort","and","keep","expect","a","cruiselin","to","appear","into","view","which","of","cours","it","doe","at","the","final","derek","be","even","nutti","she","crave","possess","of","a","larg","antiqu","bathtub","for","the","record","the","coupl","be","marri","by","the","end","of","the","filmbr","br","conjur","involv","in","the","nonev","be","the","femal","town","mayor","and","a","photograph","lothario","who","want","to","make","a","model","out","of","bo","and","who","natur","incur","the","wrath","of","the","jealou","hooten","occasion","for","no","veri","good","reason","we","re","even","treat","to","snippet","from","the","screen","of","old","hollywood","classic","in","a","openair","movi","hous","to","which","the","whole","town","assembl","among","the","titl","show","be","the","public","enemi","at","the","end","of","the","dai","while","bo","naivet","throughout","be","undeni","charm","it","not","enough","to","offset","the","film","overwhelm","dull","and","amateurish"],"filtered":["bo","derek","debut","film","remain","unseen","eight","year","stai","john","derek","compet","actor","director","virtual","ed","wood","erot","cinema","thi","especi","explicit","consid","bo","atyp","sport","dark","hair","onli","film","make","john","conjur","write","photograph","latter","result","decent","footag","greek","island","set","narr","set","plot","pueril","dialogu","atroci","br","br","charact","plai","male","lead","peter","hooten","bring","bo","famili","thei","grow","brother","sister","teen","coupl","discov","thei","re","attract","anoth","sai","expect","ani","sexual","firework","still","wrong","thing","thi","fact","protagonist","harbor","obsess","film","onli","silli","themselv","irrit","relentless","hooten","want","turn","remot","fish","commun","modern","seasid","resort","keep","expect","cruiselin","appear","view","cours","doe","final","derek","even","nutti","crave","possess","larg","antiqu","bathtub","record","coupl","marri","end","filmbr","br","conjur","involv","nonev","femal","town","mayor","photograph","lothario","want","make","model","bo","natur","incur","wrath","jealou","hooten","occasion","veri","good","reason","re","even","treat","snippet","screen","old","hollywood","classic","openair","movi","hous","whole","town","assembl","among","titl","show","public","enemi","end","dai","bo","naivet","throughout","undeni","charm","enough","offset","film","overwhelm","dull","amateurish"],"filtered2":["bo","derek","debut","remain","unseen","eight","year","stai","john","derek","compet","actor","director","virtual","ed","wood","erot","cinema","especi","explicit","consid","bo","atyp","sport","dark","hair","onli","make","john","conjur","write","photograph","latter","result","decent","footag","greek","island","set","narr","set","plot","pueril","dialogu","atroci","charact","plai","male","lead","peter","hooten","bring","bo","famili","grow","brother","sister","teen","coupl","discov","re","attract","anoth","expect","ani","sexual","firework","still","wrong","thing","fact","protagonist","harbor","obsess","onli","silli","themselv","irrit","relentless","hooten","want","turn","remot","fish","commun","modern","seasid","resort","keep","expect","cruiselin","appear","view","cours","doe","final","derek","even","nutti","crave","possess","larg","antiqu","bathtub","record","coupl","marri","end","filmbr","conjur","involv","nonev","femal","town","mayor","photograph","lothario","want","make","model","bo","natur","incur","wrath","jealou","hooten","occasion","veri","good","reason","re","even","treat","snippet","screen","old","hollywood","classic","openair","hous","whole","town","assembl","among","titl","show","public","enemi","end","dai","bo","naivet","throughout","undeni","charm","enough","offse

{"value":"Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately. Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid, redundant pulp-horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down. Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal 'Crocodile' (directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper) and 'Lake Placid'. Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and  on top of that  it likes to exaggerate tremendously. The saltwater-crocodile supposedly is 90 years old, over 30 ft long (!) and it kills for fun! During the film, he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer-dudes & dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark-congested area. The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location. Even though it's a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this, the lagoons and nature looks marvelous. Every other aspect is simply disastrous. There's a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable. The dialogues are downright painful to listen to! You won't believe some of the lines these actors have to say! I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake they're not that stupid! Early in the film, one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a 'mechanical toy' but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg's great white shark. The visual effects in 'Blood Surf' are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress. I won't say too much about the acting since it's secondary in flicks like this. The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast. You guessed right: Blood Surf is a very bad film. So bad it becomes fun again. But 'funny' for a whole other reason than James Hickox

{"value":"There are two points I need to make clear right at the beginning. First of all we all know what this year's Oscar's were REALLY all about this year. It was the Academy's way of showing people that they are no racist,and never have been. They wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves. Secondly, it's kinda pointless to make remarks about the show, because really, what difference will it make? But, it's fun to write about it. This is the year I became fed-up with the Oscar's! I will never watch the show again. Every year they do something wrong. Before Crowe wins for \"Gladaitor\" when they real winner should of been Ralph Fiennes for \"Sunshine\". If you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it and you'll agree. \"Eyes Wide Shut\" when released receieved no nominations. And as far as this year goes, well, the bad choices were all over the place! Baz Lurhmann gets no \"Best Director\" nomination! Are you joking!! \"A Beautiful Mind\" is up for \"Best Make-up\"???? \"Training Day\" gets nominated?? The movie was awful, and it seemed like Washington didn't even turn in a performance, all he proved was, he knows how to use four letter words! That's what h won the award for! Take away the language and I bet he was almost playing himself! I liked \"Gosford Park\", I really did, but why 7 nominations? And how on Earth could they not give it too Altman! I mean, c'mon, if there just giving the award to people to clear up any bad feelings, what about Altman? The man has been in the public's eye for 32 years now and no Oscar! There were many, many things that bothered me about this year's Oscar's, but, I'll live with it, as long as I never have to watch another show again! The highpoint ( and the ONLY one) of the show was when Woody Allen made his first appearance ever to the award show. That will go down as one of the greatest moments in he history of the

{"value":"This movie was awful. The ending was absolutely horrible. There was no plot to the movie whatsoever. The only thing that was decent about the movie was the acting done by Robert DuVall and James Earl Jones. Their performances were excellent! The only problem was that the movie did not do their acting performances any justice. If the script would have come close to capturing a halfway decent story, it would be worth watching. Instead, Robert DuVall's and James Earl Jones' performances are completely wasted on a god awful storyline...or lack thereof. Not only was I left waiting throughout the movie for something to happen to make the movie....well an actual movie...not just utterless dialog between characters for what ended up being absolutely no reason. It was nothing more than common dialog that would have taken place back in that period of time. There was nothing special about any of the characters. The only thing special was how Robert DuVall portrayed a rambling, senile, drunk, old man. Nothing worthy happens during the entire movie including the end. When the movie ended, I sat amazed...amazed that I sat through the entire movie waiting for something of interest to happen to make watching the movie worth while. It never happened! The cast of characters suddenly started rolling making it apparent that the movie really was over and I realized that I had just wasted 2 hours of my life watching a movie with absolutely no plot and no meaning. It wasn't even a story. The entire movie takes place in a day's worth of time. That's it. It was one day in the life (and death) of some Southerners on a plantation. How much of a story can take place in a single day (other than the movie Training Day)? The acting performances by the entire cast were excellent, but they were grossly wasted on such a disappointment of a movie...if you can even call it a movie.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","aw","the","end","be","absolut","horribl","there","be","no","plot","to","the","movi","whatsoev","the","onli","thing","that","be","decent","about","the","movi","be","the","act","do","by","robert","duval","and","jame","earl","jone","their","perform","be","excel","the","onli","problem","be","that","the","movi","do","not","do","their","act","perform","ani","justic","if","the","script","would","have","come","close","to","captur","a","halfwai","decent","stori","it","would","be","worth","watch","instead","robert","duval","and","jame","earl","jone","perform","be","complet","wast","on","a","god","aw","storylineor","lack","thereof","not","onli","be","i","leav","wait","throughout","the","movi","for","someth","to","happen","to","make","the","moviewel","a","actual","movienot","just","utterless","dialog","between","charact","for","what","end","up","be","absolut","no","reason","it","be","noth","much","than","common","dialog","that","would","have","take","place","back","in","that","period","of","time","there","be","noth","special","about","ani","of","the","charact","the","onli","thing","special","be","how","robert","duval","portrai","a","rambl","senil","drink","old","man","noth","worthi","happen","dure","the","entir","movi","includ","the","end","when","the","movi","end","i","sit","amazedamaz","that","i","sit","through","the","entir","movi","wait","for","someth","of","interest","to","happen","to","make","watch","the","movi","worth","while","it","never","happen","the","cast","of","charact","suddenli","start","roll","make","it","appar","that","the","movi","realli","be","over","and","i","realiz","that","i","have","just","wast","hour","of","my","life","watch","a","movi","with","absolut","no","plot","and","no","mean","it","be","not","even","a","stori","the","entir","movi","take","place","in","a","dai","worth","of","time","that","it","it","be","on","dai","in","the","life","and","death","of","some","southern","on","a","plantat","how","much","of","a","stori","can","take","place","in","a","singl","dai","other","than","the","movi","train","dai","the","act","perform","by","the","entir","cast","be","excel","but","thei","be","grossli","wast","on","such","a","disappoint","of","a","movieif","you","can","even","call","it","a","movi"],"filtered":["thi","movi","aw","end","absolut","horribl","plot","movi","whatsoev","onli","thing","decent","movi","act","robert","duval","jame","earl","jone","perform","excel","onli","problem","movi","act","perform","ani","justic","script","come","close","captur","halfwai","decent","stori","worth","watch","instead","robert","duval","jame","earl","jone","perform","complet","wast","god","aw","storylineor","lack","thereof","onli","leav","wait","throughout","movi","someth","happen","make","moviewel","actual","movienot","utterless","dialog","charact","end","absolut","reason","noth","much","common","dialog","take","place","back","period","time","noth","special","ani","charact","onli","thing","special","robert","duval","portrai","rambl","senil","drink","old","man","noth","worthi","happen","dure","entir","movi","includ","end","movi","end","sit","amazedamaz","sit","entir","movi","wait","someth","interest","happen","make","watch","movi","worth","never","happen","cast","charact","suddenli","start","roll","make","appar","movi","realli","realiz","wast","hour","life","watch","movi","absolut","plot","mean","even","stori","entir","movi","take","place","dai","worth","time","dai","life","death","southern","plantat","much","stori","take","place","singl","dai","movi","train","dai","act","perform","entir","cast","excel","thei","grossli","wast","disappoint","movieif","even","call","movi"],"filtered2":["aw","end","absolut","horribl","plot","whatsoev","onli","thing","decent","act","robert","duval","jame","earl","jone","perform","excel","onli","problem","act","perform","ani","justic","script","come","close","captur","halfwai","decent","stori","worth","watch","instead","robert","duval","jame","earl","jone","perform","complet","wast","god","aw","storylineor","lack","thereof","onli","leav","wait","throughout","someth","happen","make","moviewel","actual","movienot","utterless","dialog","charact","end","absolut","reason","noth","common","dialog","take","place","back","period","time","noth","special","ani","charact","onli","thing","special","robert","duval","portrai","rambl","senil","drink","old","man","noth","worthi","happen","dure","entir","includ","end","end","sit","amazedamaz","sit","entir","wait","someth","interest","happen","make","watch","worth","never","happen","cast","charact","suddenli","start","roll","make","appar","realli","realiz","wast","hour","life","watch","absolut","plot","mean","even","stori","entir","take","place","dai","worth","time","dai","life","death","southern","plantat","stori","take","place","singl","dai","train","dai","act","perform","entir","cast","excel","grossli","wast","disappoint","movieif","even","call"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,7,8,10,11,13,17,

{"value":"I like bad movies. I like to rent bad movies with my friends and rip on them for their duration. Then there are abhorrent movies like this. Redline is not just a bad movie, but a telling sign that maybe the American movie industry should please, for the sake of the viewer, at least proofread scripts before funding a movie.<br /><br />If a stereotype took a crap, this movie would spawn from that. The storyline is unbearable, and the acting all around is laughable. Nadia Bjorlin and Eddie Griffin have, perhaps, the worst screen chemistry I've seen in a good while, and even individually they should be isolated from humanity and beaten with a bag of oranges until they change their profession to street merchants (about the only thing they can legitimately qualify for). Furthermore, how Angus Macfadyen got convinced to do this movie is so far beyond me that I can't even think of an analogy. I am a loyal fan of his, but this has made me question him.<br /><br />To sum it up. Several people want revenge for different reasons (and if you care enough to know what they are, you're a bigger person than me), so much so that it turns to violence (I guess). The movie is like Ouroboros, the snake that swallows its own tail, in that it's an endless cycle of confusion and dialogue not fit for human ears. This movie is essentially one big car commercial for the first half, and an indecipherable action movie for the rest, it should be avoided at any and all costs.<br /><br />I wish I could find one positive aspect to this movie, and I think it lies in the fact that eventually the credits do roll.<br /><br />P.S. Nadia Bjorlin, if that was YOU singing those two songs in this movie, then you are a hack, and I hope old age ravages you.<br /><br />P.S.S.

{"value":"I know that in this episode there's other stuff apart from what I am going to discuss, and in fact I think it has some virtues; for example, the fact, after we had been given a very negative opinion of Jin from seeing Sun's flashbacks in \"House of the Rising Sun\", we get to see Jin's side of things and get a new, more balanced understanding of his life.<br /><br />But there is an element in this story that made me so deeply uncomfortable that it greatly dampened my enjoyment of the whole episode. Before now, in the scene where Jin appeared with blood on his hands and shirt, it had been hinted that Sun's father was someone who was getting rich through shady, illegal methods. I thought maybe he was a mob boss, even; mobs operate in Korea, just like in almost every other country in the world, so it was a reasonable possibility. However, in this episode we learn that Sun's father is in fact the boss (or a top executive) of a Korean automotive company, and that what Jin had been doing was physically attacking a government official (who was actually going to be murdered) on his behalf.<br /><br />I may be especially touchy about this because I happen to work in the automotive industry, but I would say it is SPECTACULARLY offensive and racist to even suggest that this kind of thing goes on in Korea; that huge, serious companies like Hyundai or Kia (which must be the model for this fictitious car company, as they are the only ones that actually exist in reality) operate with these mafia-like methods, instead of like any normal automotive company of the West. it is just unbelievable to me that the writers would have the gall to write something like that into the story, and that there hasn't been an uproar in Korea over it. It feels like extraneous \"Buy American!\" propaganda, portraying foreign car companies as criminal, untrustworthy, third-world outfits.","finished_norm":["i","know","that","in","thi","episod","there","other","stuff","apart","from","what","i","be","go","to","discuss","and","in","fact","i","think","it","have","some","virtu","for","exampl","the","fact","after","we","have","be","give","a","veri","neg","opinion","of","jin","from","see","sun","flashback","in","hous","of","the","rise","sun","we","get","to","see","jin","side","of","thing","and","get","a","new","much","balanc","understand","of","hi","lifebr","br","but","there","be","a","elem","in","thi","stori","that","make","me","so","deepli","uncomfort","that","it","greatli","dampen","my","enjoy","of","the","whole","episod","befor","now","in","the","scene","where","jin","appear","with","blood","on","hi","hand","and","shirt","it","have","be","hint","that","sun","father","be","someon","who","be","get","rich","through","shadi","illeg","method","i","think","mayb","he","be","a","mob","boss","even","mob","oper","in","korea","just","like","in","almost","everi","other","countri","in","the","world","so","it","be","a","reason","possibl","howev","in","thi","episod","we","learn","that","sun","father","be","in","fact","the","boss","or","a","top","execut","of","a","korean","automot","compani","and","that","what","jin","have","be","do","be","physic","attack","a","govern","offici","who","be","actual","go","to","be","murder","on","hi","behalfbr","br","i","mai","be","especi","touchi","about","thi","becaus","i","happen","to","work","in","the","automot","industri","but","i","would","sai","it","be","spectacularli","offens","and","racist","to","even","suggest","that","thi","kind","of","thing","go","on","in","korea","that","huge","seriou","compani","like","hyundai","or","kia","which","must","be","the","model","for","thi","fictiti","car","compani","a","thei","be","the","onli","on","that","actual","exist","in","realiti","oper","with","thi","mafialik","method","instead","of","like","ani","normal","automot","compani","of","the","west","it","be","just","unbeliev","to","me","that","the","writer","would","have","the","gall","to","write","someth","like","that","into","the","stori","and","that","there","have","not","be","a","uproar","in","korea","over","it","it","feel","like","extran","bui","american","propaganda","portrai","foreign","car","compani","a","crimin","untrustworthi","thirdworld","outfit"],"filtered":["know","thi","episod","stuff","apart","go","discuss","fact","think","virtu","exampl","fact","give","veri","neg","opinion","jin","see","sun","flashback","hous","rise","sun","get","see","jin","side","thing","get","new","much","balanc","understand","hi","lifebr","br","elem","thi","stori","make","deepli","uncomfort","greatli","dampen","enjoy","whole","episod","befor","scene","jin","appear","blood","hi","hand","shirt","hint","sun","father","someon","get","rich","shadi","illeg","method","think","mayb","mob","boss","even","mob","oper","korea","like","almost","everi","countri","world","reason","possibl","howev","thi","episod","learn","sun","father","fact","boss","top","execut","korean","automot","compani","jin","physic","attack","govern","offici","actual","go","murder","hi","behalfbr","br","mai","especi","touchi","thi","becaus","happen","work","automot","industri","sai","spectacularli","offens","racist","even","suggest","thi","kind","thing","go","korea","huge","seriou","compani","like","hyundai","kia","must","model","thi","fictiti","car","compani","thei","onli","actual","exist","realiti","oper","thi","mafialik","method","instead","like","ani","normal","automot","compani","west","unbeliev","writer","gall","write","someth","like","stori","uproar","korea","feel","like","extran","bui","american","propaganda","portrai","foreign","car","compani","crimin","untrustworthi","thirdworld","outfit"],"filtered2":["know","stuff","apart","go","discuss","fact","think","virtu","exampl","fact","give","veri","neg","opinion","jin","see","sun","flashback","hous","rise","sun","get","see","jin","side","thing","get","new","balanc","understand","lifebr","elem","stori","make","deepli","uncomfort","greatli","dampen","enjoy","whole","befor","scene","jin","appear","blood","hand","shirt","hint","sun","father","someon","get","rich","shadi","illeg","method","think","mayb","mob","boss","even","mob","oper","korea","like","almost","everi","countri","world","reason","possibl","howev","learn","sun","father","fact","boss","top","execut","korean","automot","compani","jin","physic","attack","govern","offici","actual","go","murder","behalfbr","mai","especi","touchi","becaus","happen","work","automot","industri","spectacularli","offens","racist","even","suggest","kind","thing","go","korea","huge","seriou","compani","like","hyundai","kia","must","model","fictiti","car","compani","onli","actual","exist","realiti","oper","mafialik","method","instead","like","ani","normal","automot","compani","west","unbeliev","writer","gall","write","someth","like","stori","uproar","korea","feel","like","extran","bui","american","propaganda","portrai","foreign","car","compani","cri

{"value":"I generally don't give worry much about violence in films, or a vast amount of philosophy, symbolism or psychology. All this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us. There is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature, a good setting of characters, a good direction. This film could be voted for as a good film. However, it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting.<br /><br />First of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film. Not movie violence, I am talking about REAL violence. This violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two; the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women. Not that we all don't have some real twists with women.(respectively men). But the conclusion of the film ruins it all. <br /><br />*spoiler* Our \"heroine\" finally dies, (by here own hand if I remember correctly I saw this film years ago and it enraged me, now the guy is out with a new film witch I am certainly not going to watch)and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon, nature growing over her, in particular her sex.. Of course it is the director who \"kills\" the women heroine. Women have to die, especially if men are attracted by their sexuality. That seems to be the final conclusion.**end spoiler*<br /><br />Well, well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself. But to use big pictures, artsy directions cruelty to living creatures, just to say men can be frightened of women, and men are cruel to women. Thats just not enough. I knew when I saw this film it would achieve good critics for the \"philosophical, eastern and artistic\" and whatever approach. But to me this film is just totally

{"value":"SciFi has been having some extremely bad luck making quality movies lately (such as Minotaur or Dog Soldiers). Grendel is supposed to be based of the great epic Beowulf, however, it deviates so much (and offers so little in comparison) that the advertisements on television might as well have titled it 'some shitty Christopher Lambert movie'. I wasn't expecting it to be as accurate as a full blown Hollywood production, but I did however expect the 'artistic integrity' to not interfere with the actual story (even if a little bit was changed to make a two hour storyboard flow nicely in the allotted time slots).<br /><br />Did the director and producers have any idea about what they were doing (did any research go into this?). Obviously not, as one could tell from the massive horned helmets that Beowulf and his crew (save for mullet boy) are wearing. One major problem I have though was with the very look of Grendelif Beowulf is supposed to wrestle him, shouldn't he not have been sixteen feet tall and weigh 2 tons? Grendel's death segment was also lacking in every way  in my opinion the one in the epic was actually better than the made up junk on the script; for example: Grendel is supposed to have his arm ripped out from the socket by Beowulf  not cut off at the forearm after he was set on fire by an exploding arrow from a crossbow that looks like it weighs 300lbs! And Grendel's motherdid they just combine her with the dragon at the end of the epic where he eventually dies when he succumbs to his wounds? And honestly, what the hell was with that mullet? <br /><br />If you want to see this movie because its connection to the epic.don't, as there really isn't one (other than character names). The only way I could recommend this film is if you liked the movie Druids (directed by Jacques Dorfmann)  although I don't recommend watching either.","finished_norm":["scifi","have","be","have","some","extrem","bad","luck","make","qualiti","movi","late","such","a","minotaur","or","dog","soldier","grendel","be","suppos","to","be","base","of","the","great","epic","beowulf","howev","it","deviat","so","much","and","offer","so","littl","in","comparison","that","the","advertis","on","televis","mai","a","good","have","titl","it","some","shitti","christoph","lambert","movi","i","be","not","expect","it","to","be","a","accur","a","a","full","blow","hollywood","product","but","i","do","howev","expect","the","artist","integr","to","not","interfer","with","the","actual","stori","even","if","a","littl","bite","be","chang","to","make","a","two","hour","storyboard","flow","nice","in","the","allot","time","slotsbr","br","do","the","director","and","produc","have","ani","idea","about","what","thei","be","do","do","ani","research","go","into","thi","obvious","not","a","on","can","tell","from","the","massiv","horn","helmet","that","beowulf","and","hi","crow","save","for","mullet","boi","be","wear","on","major","problem","i","have","though","be","with","the","veri","look","of","grendelif","beowulf","be","suppos","to","wrestl","him","should","not","he","not","have","be","sixteen","foot","tall","and","weigh","ton","grendel","death","segment","be","conjur","lack","in","everi","wai","in","my","opinion","the","on","in","the","epic","be","actual","well","than","the","make","up","junk","on","the","script","for","exampl","grendel","be","suppos","to","have","hi","arm","rip","out","from","the","socket","by","beowulf","not","cut","off","at","the","forearm","after","he","be","set","on","fire","by","a","explod","arrow","from","a","crossbow","that","look","like","it","weigh","lb","and","grendel","motherdid","thei","just","combin","her","with","the","dragon","at","the","end","of","the","epic","where","he","eventu","die","when","he","succumb","to","hi","wound","and","honestli","what","the","hell","be","with","that","mullet","br","br","if","you","want","to","see","thi","movi","becaus","it","connect","to","the","epicdont","a","there","realli","be","not","on","other","than","charact","name","the","onli","wai","i","can","recommend","thi","film","be","if","you","like","the","movi","druid","direct","by","jacqu","dorfmann","although","i","do","not","recommend","watch","either"],"filtered":["scifi","extrem","bad","luck","make","qualiti","movi","late","minotaur","dog","soldier","grendel","suppos","base","great","epic","beowulf","howev","deviat","much","offer","littl","comparison","advertis","televis","mai","good","titl","shitti","christoph","lambert","movi","expect","accur","full","blow","hollywood","product","howev","expect","artist","integr","interfer","actual","stori","even","littl","bite","chang","make","two","hour","storyboard","flow","nice","allot","time","slotsbr","br","director","produc","ani","idea","thei","ani","research","go","thi","obvious","tell","massiv","horn","helmet","beowulf","hi","crow","save","mullet","boi","wear","major","problem","though","veri","look","grendelif","beowulf","suppos","wrestl","sixteen","foot","tall","weigh","ton","grendel","death","segment","conjur","lack","everi","wai","opinion","epic","actual","well","make","junk","script","exampl","grendel","suppos","hi","arm","rip","socket","beowulf","cut","forearm","set","fire","explod","arrow","crossbow","look","like","weigh","lb","grendel","motherdid","thei","combin","dragon","end","epic","eventu","die","succumb","hi","wound","honestli","hell","mullet","br","br","want","see","thi","movi","becaus","connect","epicdont","realli","charact","name","onli","wai","recommend","thi","film","like","movi","druid","direct","jacqu","dorfmann","although","recommend","watch","either"],"filtered2":["scifi","extrem","bad","luck","make","qualiti","late","minotaur","dog","soldier","grendel","suppos","base","great","epic","beowulf","howev","deviat","offer","littl","comparison","advertis","televis","mai","good","titl","shitti","christoph","lambert","expect","accur","full","blow","hollywood","product","howev","expect","artist","integr","interfer","actual","stori","even","littl","bite","chang","make","two","hour","storyboard","flow","nice","allot","time","slotsbr","director","produc","ani","idea","ani","research","go","obvious","tell","massiv","horn","helmet","beowulf","crow","save","mullet","boi","wear","major","problem","though","veri","look","grendelif","beowulf","suppos","wrestl","sixteen","foot","tall","weigh","ton","grendel","death","segment","conjur","lack","everi","wai","opinion","epic","actual","well","make","junk","script","exampl","grendel","suppos","arm","rip","socket","beowulf","cut","forearm","set","fire","explod","arrow","crossbow","look","like","weigh","lb","grendel","motherdid","combin","dragon","end","epic","eventu","die","succumb","wound","honestli","hell","mullet","want","see","becaus","connect","epicdont","realli","charact","name","onli","wai","recommend","like","druid","direct","jacqu","dorfmann","although","recomm

{"value":"I was very surprised how bad this movie was. Nice cinematography and beautiful landscapes can only take the movie so far. I was hoping for a rerun of Hero, but this is much, much worse.<br /><br />This movie is why kung fu movies got a bad reputation in the first place. No believable characters (even within the cartoonish world of kung fu movies, these characters are ridiculous), virtually no plot, and ridiculous story twists.<br /><br />This movie is so boring and so frustrating because it reminds you of trying to play a make believe game with a child. Every time you think your silly battle makes some sense, they invent another ridiculous twist that makes no sense (\"Ah ha, you only think you've got me with your super powers and 10,000 ray guns, but I ate my vitamins laced with plutonium and teflon, so your ray guns don't work and I'm invulnerable to your super powers....tap tap no trade backs infinity PLUS one.\") Children can continue with this lunacy, because they don't really care whether anyone is listening because they are having a fun time. However, for the VIEWER, especially the adult viewer, this long movie is worse than a bout with bad gas.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD Note to kung fu movie makers, (a) if you have a knife in your back it hurts unless you are on PCP, in which case your kung fu is not strong, (b) if you repeatedly fall on your back, which has a knife in it, it will hurt more and do more damage, unless it is a fake prop, (c) when you get stabbed in the heart with a knife, you die, especially in ancient china where there isn't a Kaiser Permanente around the corner, (d) kung fu fights don't last for hours while 3 feet

{"value":"It's rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site, but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created, and how bias its product was.<br /><br />I felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film-makers to display the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy. We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace.<br /><br />I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic, in my mind, to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land.<br /><br />I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative. Also for the poor edits, lack of background in the actual instance, and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately, it is a poor documentary and a poor film. I acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation, but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart-wrenching and sad subject matter.","finished_norm":["it","rare","that","i","feel","a","ne","to","write","a","review","on","thi","site","but","thi","film","be","veri","deserv","becaus","of","how","poorli","it","be","creat","and","how","bia","it","product","wasbr","br","i","feel","a","distinct","attempt","on","the","part","of","the","filmmak","to","displai","the","palestinian","famili","a","boorish","and","untrustworthi","we","hear","them","discuss","the","sad","that","thei","feel","from","oppress","yet","the","film","be","shoot","and","arrang","in","a","wai","that","we","feel","the","polit","oppress","popul","be","the","jewish","isra","popul","we","see","no","evid","that","parallel","the","posit","of","the","palestinian","teenag","we","onli","hear","from","other","palestinian","in","prison","i","understand","restrict","be","in","place","but","the","polit","natur","of","the","restrict","be","design","to","prevent","peacebr","br","i","come","out","of","the","film","feel","that","the","mother","of","the","victim","be","selfish","in","her","mourn","and","complet","close","mind","due","to","her","side","of","the","fenc","so","to","speak","she","continu","to","be","unwil","to","see","the","hurt","of","the","bomber","parent","and","her","angri","and","closedmind","word","caus","the","final","meet","to","spiral","out","of","control","it","be","much","realist","in","my","mind","to","see","the","isra","mindset","to","be","a","root","of","the","problem","ignor","plea","for","understand","and","freedom","ignor","request","for","acknowledg","for","the","process","by","which","the","jewish","popul","acquir","the","landbr","br","i","have","give","thi","a","two","becaus","of","thi","selfish","weak","of","the","mother","which","normal","would","be","admir","in","a","documentari","howev","in","the","light","of","the","lack","of","imparti","it","all","seem","exploit","conjur","for","the","poor","edit","lack","of","background","in","the","actual","instanc","and","final","the","lack","of","proper","represent","of","the","palestinian","side","ultim","it","be","a","poor","documentari","and","a","poor","film","i","acknowledg","thi","be","partial","the","result","of","the","polit","situat","but","be","oblig","to","note","the","flaw","in","direct","regardless","of","the","heartwrench","and","sad","subject","matt"],"filtered":["rare","feel","ne","write","review","thi","site","thi","film","veri","deserv","becaus","poorli","creat","bia","product","wasbr","br","feel","distinct","attempt","part","filmmak","displai","palestinian","famili","boorish","untrustworthi","hear","discuss","sad","thei","feel","oppress","yet","film","shoot","arrang","wai","feel","polit","oppress","popul","jewish","isra","popul","see","evid","parallel","posit","palestinian","teenag","onli","hear","palestinian","prison","understand","restrict","place","polit","natur","restrict","design","prevent","peacebr","br","come","film","feel","mother","victim","selfish","mourn","complet","close","mind","due","side","fenc","speak","continu","unwil","see","hurt","bomber","parent","angri","closedmind","word","caus","final","meet","spiral","control","much","realist","mind","see","isra","mindset","root","problem","ignor","plea","understand","freedom","ignor","request","acknowledg","process","jewish","popul","acquir","landbr","br","give","thi","two","becaus","thi","selfish","weak","mother","normal","admir","documentari","howev","light","lack","imparti","seem","exploit","conjur","poor","edit","lack","background","actual","instanc","final","lack","proper","represent","palestinian","side","ultim","poor","documentari","poor","film","acknowledg","thi","partial","result","polit","situat","oblig","note","flaw","direct","regardless","heartwrench","sad","subject","matt"],"filtered2":["rare","feel","ne","write","review","site","veri","deserv","becaus","poorli","creat","bia","product","wasbr","feel","distinct","attempt","part","filmmak","displai","palestinian","famili","boorish","untrustworthi","hear","discuss","sad","feel","oppress","yet","shoot","arrang","wai","feel","polit","oppress","popul","jewish","isra","popul","see","evid","parallel","posit","palestinian","teenag","onli","hear","palestinian","prison","understand","restrict","place","polit","natur","restrict","design","prevent","peacebr","come","feel","mother","victim","selfish","mourn","complet","close","mind","due","side","fenc","speak","continu","unwil","see","hurt","bomber","parent","angri","closedmind","word","caus","final","meet","spiral","control","realist","mind","see","isra","mindset","root","problem","ignor","plea","understand","freedom","ignor","request","acknowledg","process","jewish","popul","acquir","landbr","give","two","becaus","selfish","weak","mother","normal","admir","documentari","howev","light","lack","imparti","seem","exploit","conjur","poor","edit","lack","background","actual","instanc","final","lack","proper","represent","palestinian","side","ultim","poor","documentari","poor","acknowledg","partial","result","polit","situat","oblig","note",

{"value":"How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy, I never did see the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake that was made with humans, the cartoon was just perfect enough, what's the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch. I mean he's a great comedic actor, but him as the Grinch? It just didn't make any sense to me. His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments. Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable. The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over done and wasn't needed. They actually just destroyed the story, period.<br /><br />All the who's in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a Christmas as the other who's. He kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want Christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show the who's what his version of Christmas is all about. But soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas.<br /><br />How the Grinch Stole Christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top. I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done, not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is played every Christmas.<br /><br

{"value":"I don't hand out \"ones\" often, but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention, it's \"Gas!\" This is self-indulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of M*A*S*H and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt.<br /><br />I see what Corman was going for - Malcolm Marmorstein and Elliott Gould tried to reproduce Gould's deathless role in the original movie version of M*A*S*H with a similar plot (in the movie \"Whiffs\" - look it up here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073891/ for more information).<br /><br />Marmorstein and Gould got closer to the brass ring with \"Whiffs\" than Corman did with \"Gas!\" but didn't quite get there. Neither one of those films even got close to the success of M*A*S*H.<br /><br />What's wrong with \"Gas!\"? What isn't? No one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics. The production values stink. Someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car, and there's more of that lack of attention to detail. Nothing works the way it's supposed to in this film, and nobody cares.<br /><br />\"Gas!\" actually put me to sleep. It's not a sure cure for insomnia, but really close. On the Cinematic Sleep Induction scale, \"Gas!\" falls somewhere between \"Last Year at Marienbad\" and George Clooney's remake of \"Solaris\" (which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the Mosfilm original, despite that studio's seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audience's attention by judicious editing).<br /><br />Judicious editing would have decimated \"Gas!\" to about twenty minutes. The result would be pointless, but no more so than the original film.<br /><br />Certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway. This isn't one of them. Don't waste your time.

{"value":"Band Camp was awful, The Naked Mile was a little better, and this third straight to DVD in the American Pie franchise seems the same quality as the predecessor. Basically Erik Stifler (John White) split from his girlfriend after losing his virginity, and now him and Mike 'Cooze' Coozeman (Jake Siegel) are joining Erik's cousin Dwight (Steve Talley) at college. With the promise of many parties, plenty of booze, and enough hot chicks at the Beta House, they only have fifty listed tasks to carry out to become official privileged members. But a threat comes into sight with the rivals, GEK (\"Geek\") House, led by power-hungry nerd (and sheep shagger) Edgar (Tyrone Savage) offering bigger and better than what Beta have. To settle it once and for all, Beta and Gek go into battle with the banned, for forty years, Greek Games to beat each other in, with the loser moving out. The last champion of the games, Noah Levenstein aka Jim's Dad (the only regular Eugene Levy) runs the show, which sees the people unhooking bras, a gladiator duel floating on water, catching a greased pig, Russian Roulette in the mouth with cartridges of aged horse spunk, wife carrying and drinking a full keg of alcohol (with puking not disqualifying). It all comes to the sudden death, with a guy getting stripper lap dancing, and they have to resist cumming, Beta House win when Edgar cums with a girl dressed as a sheep on his lap. Also starring Flubber's Christopher McDonald as Mr. Stifler, Meghan Heffern as Ashley, Dan Petronijevic as Bull, Nic Nac as Bobby, Christine Barger as Margie, Italia Ricci as Laura Johnson, Moshana Halbert as Sara Coleman, Sarah Power as Denise, Andreja Punkris as Stacy and Jordan Prentice as Rock. The nudity amount is very slightly increased, as is the grossness of the jokes, and I could guess it being rated one star out of five, but I like it.

Gereco Biotech company is fooling around with growth hormone research, accidentally releasing a baby crocodile which is evolving at an accelerating rate.<br /><br />B-movie cast add a deal of fun to this run of the mill \"genetic mistake monster movie\". Costas Mandylor evokes Mick Dundee, Aussie accent, hat, big ass knife, the works, as a croc specialist hired by Gereco executive Joanna Pacula(..wasted in the stereotypical role of corrupt administrative executive who denies any involvement with the gigantic beast her facility let free on innocent people). Charles Napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and Jane Longenecker is his hot daughter, who works at the animal shelter. Soap opera star Matthew Borlenghi is Longenecker's love interest, a local artist who welds sculptures(..his brother is a victim of the croc). Of course, this skill will come in mighty handy when our heroes set up a created trap for the croc, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide.<br /><br />The croc itself is never the least bit convincing as it rampages through a reserve looking for food, the special effects of a low grade variety. In regards to Roger Corman productions dealing with renegade dino-monsters, I stick with Carnosaur. The monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on it's hind legs, often upright as it pursues potential victims. I felt Mandylor and the filmmakers were spoofing Crocodile Dundee with his croc hunter, and this imitation might amuse where the monster itself fails. Borlenghi and Longenecker actually have pretty good chemistry together on screen.

{"value":"Imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding Barbara Cartland there... that's what happens with this film.<br /><br />The opening showed promise, but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller (or even an imaginative love story) and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear: to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another re-hash of 'mis-understood, brooding bad-boy' (Andrei) meets 'innocent, whimsical beauty' (Paula). <br /><br />Rather than waste any time in creating an original premise, the filmmakers went straight for the money-shot: the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty. Thence follows a string of insincere and heavily-clichéd love scenes sprinkled with pseudo philosophical/poetic fluff. Andrei's admission of being (eponymously) a 'poet' is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a Byronic hero should have - but even when we're told in heavy, underlined writing who and what he is, it's still difficult to believe it - or care.<br /><br />For a Byronic hero/antihero to work, the story needs subtlety, style and innovation - all of which are utterly absent here. This is not a modern day Phantom of the Opera, it's just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman (with loose knicker elastic) dates a bad man, who, after meeting her, seems as dangerous as bunny slippers.<br /><br />The performances might have saved this film, had they been any good: the female lead is preoccupied with looking sexy and 'otherworldly', no matter how forced or ridiculous; and poor Dougray Scott appears to have been drugged as he shambles through his part. This is not his best work. The glimmers of interest were brought by Jürgen Prochnow as 'Vashon', and Andrew Lee Potts as the young photographer/brother. A better movie would have offed the sister and kept the brother

{"value":"Wow. That's about as much as I can say right now. Who writes this stuff? Who produces this stuff? What self-respecting actor would agree to 'act' in this stuff? Oh my GOD! I don't know how I made it through this movie, but I assume the fact that I had had like 8 cups of coffee that day was the key element in keeping me awake. Good Lord! It was one of the most droned-out and predictable pieces of cinematography I have ever witnessed...and for the record, I don't EVER plan to 'witness' it again.<br /><br />I first saw the film when I bought the DVD (MISTAKE #1). I mean...I figured, hey! Julia Stiles. I like her. She's cool. I'll watch it as soon as I get home (MISTAKE #2). I tried to watch it without groaning every five minutes wondering when this bunch of crap would come to an end, really I did. But I was unsuccessful. It was one of the worst things I had ever seen. I mean...what is with that thing where he imagines what would happen then snaps back into real life? That was annoying enough when the father used to do that in 'Parenthood' like ten years ago. The 'jokes' - and BELIEVE me, it takes a LOT out of me to call them that - are stupid, the characters are trite and forgettable, the storyline is entirely predictable...altogether this makes for a movie that should be WIPED FROM HISTORY RECORDS! I should have figured something was wrong when I realized that I'd never heard of this movie. It was most likely a straight-to-DVD.<br /><br />To anybody who may be thinking of watching this, I have one piece of advice. DON'T! For the LOVE of God...DON'T!!! I'm ashamed to have it in my DVD collection, and I can't get rid of it...Nobody, and I mean NOBODY wants to buy it from me!

{"value":"- When the local sheriff is killed, his wife takes over until and is determined to clean-up the town. Not everyone in town, however, is happy with what she's doing. When the sheriff orders a curfew in town, the local saloon owner (also a woman) hires a killer to take care of the sheriff. There's no way the saloon owner could know that the sheriff and the killer would fall in love.<br /><br />- Gunslinger is an example of what happens when you have a fairly interesting concept and combine it with poor execution. There's a good movie here somewhere trying to get out. In more capable hands or with a larger budget, Gunslinger might have been an entertaining look at the role of women in the Old West. As it is, Gunslinger is a sloppy mess of a movie.<br /><br />- There are just so many things wrong with the movie: a supporting cast with no acting ability, stilted and unnatural dialogue, and sets that look like sets. But the biggest offender is the editing. I was amazed at how many times a scene would begin with the actors (and horses for that matter) obviously waiting for Corman to yell \"Action\". The best is the scene of two riders on horseback just standing beside a building. All of a sudden, they take off and come racing around the corner like they had been riding hard for several miles. Or, take the example of people who can seemingly transport themselves across town. We see a man enter a building and a second later emerge across town to mount his horse.<br /><br />- It's not as if Corman didn't have a few decent actors to work with. While none were great stars, Beverly Garland, John Ireland, and Allison Hayes were all capable of turning in a good performance. But, in Gunslinger, they're not given much to work with.<br /><br />- I have now seen both the MST3K and non-MST3K versions of the movie. I would strongly recommend going the MST3K

{"value":"Unimaginably stupid, redundant and humiliating closure to the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\"-series! Part 6 is so incompetent that it looks like director Rachel Talalay intentionally wanted to turn Wes Craven's initial premise into one big bad and tasteless joke. This isn't just the worst entry in the \"Elm Street\" saga; it's also one of the most embarrassing horror movies ever made and it downright offends fans of the genre! The story is dumb, the character drawings are ridiculous, the structure is all murky and  most of all  the special and visual effects resemble those of a Tom & Jerry cartoon. The sequences in which Freddy Krueger murders his victims are endless and very uninteresting. Were we supposed to be petrified when a jabbering Freddy turned Breckin Meyer into a video game-character and pogo-sticked him around the walls of a house? The story takes us back to Springwood and it appears that Freddy all of a sudden has a middle-aged daughter. You'd think he would mention that in one of his previous adventures, but no There's only one teenage-survivor in Springwood and Krueger uses him to get into contact with his long lost daughter. Another reason why this final installment is so awful is the completely illogical structure. The John Doe-boy is introduced as the leading character but then all of a sudden he dies and the plot continues to revolve on two adults! How about that: Freddy Krueger, who spent five entire films killing nothing but teenagers, eventually gets beaten by two adults wearing 3D-glasses! Sort of like ruins the whole essence, doesn't it? As far as I'm concerned, \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" has always been a dreadfully overrated series but, up until now, even the weakest entries had at least some redeeming elements. \"Freddy's Dead\", however, is simply unendurable and nobody should waste his/her precious time watching it.","finished_norm":["unimagin","stupid","redund","and","humili","closur","to","the","nightmar","on","elm","streetseri","part","be","so","incompet","that","it","look","like","director","rachel","talalai","intention","want","to","turn","we","craven","initi","premis","into","on","big","bad","and","tasteless","joke","thi","be","not","just","the","wrong","entri","in","the","elm","street","saga","it","conjur","on","of","the","much","embarrass","horror","movi","ever","make","and","it","downright","offend","fan","of","the","genr","the","stori","be","dumb","the","charact","drawe","be","ridicul","the","structur","be","all","murki","and","much","of","all","the","special","and","visual","effect","resembl","that","of","a","tom","jerri","cartoon","the","sequenc","in","which","freddi","krueger","murder","hi","victim","be","endless","and","veri","uninterest","be","we","suppos","to","be","petrifi","when","a","jabber","freddi","turn","breckin","meyer","into","a","video","gamecharact","and","pogostick","him","around","the","wall","of","a","hous","the","stori","take","u","back","to","springwood","and","it","appear","that","freddi","all","of","a","sudden","have","a","middleag","daughter","you","have","think","he","would","mention","that","in","on","of","hi","previou","adventur","but","no","there","onli","on","teenagesurvivor","in","springwood","and","krueger","us","him","to","get","into","contact","with","hi","long","lose","daughter","anoth","reason","why","thi","final","instal","be","so","aw","be","the","complet","illog","structur","the","john","doeboi","be","introduc","a","the","lead","charact","but","then","all","of","a","sudden","he","die","and","the","plot","continu","to","revolv","on","two","adult","how","about","that","freddi","krueger","who","spend","five","entir","film","kill","noth","but","teenag","eventu","get","beat","by","two","adult","wear","dglass","sort","of","like","ruin","the","whole","essenc","doe","not","it","a","far","a","i","be","concern","nightmar","on","elm","street","have","alwai","be","a","dreadfulli","overr","seri","but","up","until","now","even","the","weak","entri","have","at","littl","some","redeem","elem","freddi","dead","howev","be","simpli","unendur","and","nobodi","should","wast","hisher","preciou","time","watch","it"],"filtered":["unimagin","stupid","redund","humili","closur","nightmar","elm","streetseri","part","incompet","look","like","director","rachel","talalai","intention","want","turn","craven","initi","premis","big","bad","tasteless","joke","thi","wrong","entri","elm","street","saga","conjur","much","embarrass","horror","movi","ever","make","downright","offend","fan","genr","stori","dumb","charact","drawe","ridicul","structur","murki","much","special","visual","effect","resembl","tom","jerri","cartoon","sequenc","freddi","krueger","murder","hi","victim","endless","veri","uninterest","suppos","petrifi","jabber","freddi","turn","breckin","meyer","video","gamecharact","pogostick","around","wall","hous","stori","take","u","back","springwood","appear","freddi","sudden","middleag","daughter","think","mention","hi","previou","adventur","onli","teenagesurvivor","springwood","krueger","us","get","contact","hi","long","lose","daughter","anoth","reason","thi","final","instal","aw","complet","illog","structur","john","doeboi","introduc","lead","charact","sudden","die","plot","continu","revolv","two","adult","freddi","krueger","spend","five","entir","film","kill","noth","teenag","eventu","get","beat","two","adult","wear","dglass","sort","like","ruin","whole","essenc","doe","far","concern","nightmar","elm","street","alwai","dreadfulli","overr","seri","even","weak","entri","littl","redeem","elem","freddi","dead","howev","simpli","unendur","nobodi","wast","hisher","preciou","time","watch"],"filtered2":["unimagin","stupid","redund","humili","closur","nightmar","elm","streetseri","part","incompet","look","like","director","rachel","talalai","intention","want","turn","craven","initi","premis","big","bad","tasteless","joke","wrong","entri","elm","street","saga","conjur","embarrass","horror","ever","make","downright","offend","fan","genr","stori","dumb","charact","drawe","ridicul","structur","murki","special","visual","effect","resembl","tom","jerri","cartoon","sequenc","freddi","krueger","murder","victim","endless","veri","uninterest","suppos","petrifi","jabber","freddi","turn","breckin","meyer","video","gamecharact","pogostick","around","wall","hous","stori","take","u","back","springwood","appear","freddi","sudden","middleag","daughter","think","mention","previou","adventur","onli","teenagesurvivor","springwood","krueger","us","get","contact","long","lose","daughter","anoth","reason","final","instal","aw","complet","illog","structur","john","doeboi","introduc","lead","charact","sudden","die","plot","continu","revolv","two","adult","freddi","krueger","spend","five","entir","kill","noth","teenag","eventu","get","beat","two","adult","wear","dglass","sort","like","ruin","whole","essenc","doe","far","concern

{"value":"I must tell you right up front, I am certainly NOT an authority on Bollywood films and have only seen a handful. However, if you've never seen one, DON'T start with this one! I have greatly enjoyed the ones I've seen up until this one, but I just couldn't stand this one. I also must tell you up front that I could not finish this film--it was that annoying. So why was it so annoying? <br /><br />1. There is a character named 'Rambha' in the film. He is even more annoying than Jar-Jar Binks--which I never would have believed would have been possible. He is so #@^!# annoying!! He spoke in a falsetto voice and I think was meant to be comic relief. Instead, he just grated on my nerves and wanted him to die...slowly! His voice, his mannerisms and his obnoxiousness--he just didn't seem to shut up and dominated every scene he was in--and he needed to die! <br /><br />2. The heroes had the amazing ability to dodge AK-47 bullets with ease. I kid you not--there was a scene where several unarmed guys took on a small army of guys with these assault rifles!! And, again and again, they avoided taking a single bullet AND beat up the ruffians!!! This made Stallone's actions in \"Rambo II\" look mundane!! <br /><br />3. The film was so gosh-darn loud, in your face and intense--it practically made my brain bleed!! It was as if the film were made by people under the influence of meth!! Crazy camera angles, INTENSE music and action, action, action...this movie is clearly designed for someone who can't take a movie with plot and wants nearly 100% action.<br /><br />4. The two main characters and their actions and motivations made zero sense...none whatsoever! <br /><br />Perhaps if you are the most ardent action and Bollywood fan you can stand this film, but as for me I can see why it's on IMDb's infamous Bottom 100 list.

{"value":"I did not enjoy the film, Joshua, at all. Perhaps it is because I saw another, much better similar film titled Orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it's really just because this film was not very good. I am going with the ladder. Sure, the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesn't mean the film could not succeed. It could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building, boring, uneventful and really didn't leave me thinking anything more than 'that wasn't very good' when it was all over.<br /><br />At the end, Joshua's motivations are revealed. I won't give that away but the reality is that he didn't really accomplish his goals since despite Vera Farmiga as his mother, Abby, disappearing about 3/4th through the movie, all arrows point to her returning home soon. She was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then Joshua's Father/Her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically. So.. shouldn't she be coming home soon? Won't Joshua have failed? Won't his Mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his Father soon? I question the Father since his future is left open ended.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I didn't care about the characters. The evil demon child Joshua wasn't really scary. The storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring. Suspense fell flat every single time. When it was over I couldn't believe I had sat through the whole thing. <br /><br />4/10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially Vera Farmiga as the Mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil 'child' go see Orphan. Now that's a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie.","finished_norm":["i","do","not","enjoi","the","film","joshua","at","all","perhap","it","be","becaus","i","see","anoth","much","well","similar","film","titl","orphan","dai","prior","but","perhap","it","realli","just","becaus","thi","film","be","not","veri","good","i","be","go","with","the","ladder","sure","the","plot","of","a","evil","child","be","not","exactli","origin","but","that","doe","not","mean","the","film","can","not","succ","it","can","have","be","suspens","and","entertain","and","chill","but","instead","it","be","slow","build","bore","unev","and","realli","do","not","leav","me","think","anyth","much","than","that","be","not","veri","good","when","it","be","all","overbr","br","at","the","end","joshua","motiv","be","reveal","i","wo","not","give","that","awai","but","the","realiti","be","that","he","do","not","realli","accomplish","hi","goal","sinc","despit","vera","farmiga","a","hi","mother","abbi","disappear","about","th","through","the","movi","all","arrow","point","to","her","return","home","soon","she","be","commit","to","a","mental","institut","becaus","she","be","lose","her","mind","but","then","joshua","fatherh","husband","be","accus","of","tamper","with","her","medic","which","tell","the","audienc","that","the","institut","realiz","that","she","be","ind","not","mental","ill","but","rather","be","be","dose","medic","so","should","not","she","be","come","home","soon","wo","not","joshua","have","fail","wo","not","hi","mother","be","live","with","him","and","hi","sister","and","possibli","hi","father","soon","i","question","the","father","sinc","hi","futur","be","leav","open","endedbr","br","at","the","end","of","the","dai","i","do","not","care","about","the","charact","the","evil","demon","child","joshua","be","not","realli","scari","the","storylin","move","slowli","and","when","it","pick","up","it","be","still","bore","suspens","fall","flat","everi","singl","time","when","it","be","over","i","can","not","believ","i","have","sit","through","the","whole","thing","br","br","just","becaus","the","act","be","good","from","the","parent","especi","vera","farmiga","a","the","mother","but","if","you","want","to","see","a","movi","about","a","evil","child","go","see","orphan","now","that","a","movi","that","take","a","unorigin","concept","and","creat","a","brilliant","movi"],"filtered":["enjoi","film","joshua","perhap","becaus","see","anoth","much","well","similar","film","titl","orphan","dai","prior","perhap","realli","becaus","thi","film","veri","good","go","ladder","sure","plot","evil","child","exactli","origin","doe","mean","film","succ","suspens","entertain","chill","instead","slow","build","bore","unev","realli","leav","think","anyth","much","veri","good","overbr","br","end","joshua","motiv","reveal","wo","give","awai","realiti","realli","accomplish","hi","goal","sinc","despit","vera","farmiga","hi","mother","abbi","disappear","th","movi","arrow","point","return","home","soon","commit","mental","institut","becaus","lose","mind","joshua","fatherh","husband","accus","tamper","medic","tell","audienc","institut","realiz","ind","mental","ill","rather","dose","medic","come","home","soon","wo","joshua","fail","wo","hi","mother","live","hi","sister","possibli","hi","father","soon","question","father","sinc","hi","futur","leav","open","endedbr","br","end","dai","care","charact","evil","demon","child","joshua","realli","scari","storylin","move","slowli","pick","still","bore","suspens","fall","flat","everi","singl","time","believ","sit","whole","thing","br","br","becaus","act","good","parent","especi","vera","farmiga","mother","want","see","movi","evil","child","go","see","orphan","movi","take","unorigin","concept","creat","brilliant","movi"],"filtered2":["enjoi","joshua","perhap","becaus","see","anoth","well","similar","titl","orphan","dai","prior","perhap","realli","becaus","veri","good","go","ladder","sure","plot","evil","child","exactli","origin","doe","mean","succ","suspens","entertain","chill","instead","slow","build","bore","unev","realli","leav","think","anyth","veri","good","overbr","end","joshua","motiv","reveal","wo","give","awai","realiti","realli","accomplish","goal","sinc","despit","vera","farmiga","mother","abbi","disappear","th","arrow","point","return","home","soon","commit","mental","institut","becaus","lose","mind","joshua","fatherh","husband","accus","tamper","medic","tell","audienc","institut","realiz","ind","mental","ill","rather","dose","medic","come","home","soon","wo","joshua","fail","wo","mother","live","sister","possibli","father","soon","question","father","sinc","futur","leav","open","endedbr","end","dai","care","charact","evil","demon","child","joshua","realli","scari","storylin","move","slowli","pick","still","bore","suspens","fall","flat","everi","singl","time","believ","sit","whole","thing","becaus","act","good","parent","especi","vera","farmiga","mother","want","see","evil","child","go","see","orphan","take","unorigin","concept","creat","brilliant"],"features":{"type

{"value":"Slaughter High is intrinsically your emblematic 80s slasher flick. A prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt. A few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him. Now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining, but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the 80s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless flaws and continuation errors.<br /><br />The acting is horrendous, however, actually not as bad as one would suspect. Though it doesn't help that every character in the film are so grody and unlikable. The lead, Carol Manning (Caroline Munro) is the easily the biggest tormentor of them all and she's the one that we are ostensibly supposed to share compassion and root for. Not to mention, the geeky guy is almost too geeky and I think that even stereotypical geeks themselves would be rudely maddened and just downright antagonized by how geeky he his, so when he gets mauled, does anyone really care? <br /><br />There is much unintentional laughter potential. Munro's lack of acting talent is quite apparent, which puts her down at the same level as the rest of the awful cast. However, the most amusement is easily when the film poorly attempts to pose Munro, who is in her mid 30s at the time, as a teenager amongst a cast of teenagers. And then when it comes to later life and Munro is playing around her real age, the rest of the cast do not pass as adults. This all goes well with a theme song that is a hilariously pose of heavy metal thrash accompanied by maniacal laughter and a voice shrieking \"I'll get you.\" With that being said, Slaughter High really isn't a very good slasher flick, but it does have a bad cheesy entertainment value to it. Perhaps an essential for hardcore slasher fans, but don't expect dilemma, suspense, or any credibility from it.

{"value":"From the first moment, this \"thing\" is just an awful sequence of extremely short cuts of blurry camera work. While the overall plot has every potential for a thriller, the story is so badly told that I'm unable to buy it. From the middle of the film, the actions of characters don't make sense to me. Stop reading now to avoid SPOILERS.<br /><br />For instance, Ed's idea to have Edna make coffee for them after having shot off her son's arm is way below his alleged experience; it's just an extremely stupid idea. Domino not questioning the fragmentary orders she receives from Claremont Williams over a breaking-up phone connection just eludes me; shouldn't she be long suspicious that Williams is turning them in? Those FBI agents seem out of their minds showing up with just one single helicopter to something they have every reason to consider a capital mafia shoot-out. Besides, what they do by withholding and leaking information towards Cigliutti is pretty much incitement to murder; it seems to me like farewell to justice if that's they way the FBI does investigations. In reality, they'd have a case messed up beyond repair if they acted like this. We get to see a car accident which normally would have at least seriously injured if not killed most of the passengers but miraculously leaves all of them with just a few bruises. Quite the contrary, the accident is immediately followed by Domino making love to Choco, which is from Domino's viewpoint in no way founded by previous events but just by being drugged to the eyeballs.<br /><br />The whole sequence of scenes starting from the phone call of Claremont Williams appears to me just as want-to-be dramatic razzle-dazzle. This combined with the awful, uneasy camera work just makes a piece I hesitate to call a movie. I'm sorry for the wasted effort of the main actors, whose talent is out of

{"value":"Bo Derek will not go down in history as a great actress. On the other hand, starting in the 1980s, actual acting talent seemed to be less and less of a required ability in Hollywood, so Bo could very well have gone onto bigger and better things after the big box office take of Blake Edwards' \"10.\" That is if she hadn't allowed her husband, John Derek, to take over her career. Numerous Playboy spreads and bad movies like this one (this one in particular) directed by John destroyed what momentum she had and made her the butt of many a joke. In the 1980s it was assumed that you could put a certain personality in a certain movie and it would be box office gold. John figured that putting Bo in a movie wherein she was nude for much of the running time would make people flock to the theaters after the 10 hype. Maybe if the movie had been any good perhaps. This version of Tarzan has got to be the all time worst of the many iterpretations of Burrough's lord of the jungle, a slap in the face to character's book and film legacy. Tarzan is in fact an after thought as the film is primarily a vehicle for Bo's breasts and Richard Harris' wonderful over acting (remember, the pair had worked together in Orca). His scenery chewing helps you to stay awake during the boredom of it all and yes, the film is quite boring. Nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance. Bo's body can only get you so far. Miles O'Keeffe who played Tarzan at least would go onto a long and enjoyable B movie career and Richard Harris can put this behind him after his recent acting triumphs, but Bo and John Derek never

{"value":"To preface this review, I must say that I was, I suppose, a little curious about this movie.. However, I probably would not have seen it had I not had my arm slightly twisted.<br /><br />In my opinion, this movie shows just how depraved man can be. In my eyes, the worst thing about this whole Springer phenomenon is not that type of people on the \"Jerry Springer Show\" act as they do (which in itself is eminently reproachable), but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives (yes, I suppose that includes me.. to whatever extent it is true). If not glorifying that kind of behavior (as some might say) at the very least we may be subtly corrupting our minds and/or desenstizing ourselves to this type of behavior.<br /><br />But enough soapbox (sort of). Here's the skinny: the movie has an R rating, and while it may deserve only that (I did look away at some scenes, so I'm not completely sure), I feel that an NC-17 (tip of the hat to the other reviewer) might be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content (a cynic might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen). The plot is very bizarre, tying together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset who will appear on different Springer shows. At the end, the movie leaves one with some resolvement- and Springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world (evidently as seen through his show). I agree with him there- it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek to effect positive change. Having said that, let me just tell you- the world's pretty bad- glance in a newpaper or the news to see that, but let's not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalistic and perhaps formulaic titallition that Springer seeks to give

{"value":"OK, it's very rare that I complain something I got for FREE. So I guess this movie pushed me over that limit. I saw it at the Hollywood Cemetery for FREE and walked away very very disappointed. One audience member's question to the director about using the Native American references just as \"bookends\" instead of being weaved into the movie better, basically says everything that this movie FAILED on. <br /><br />NATIVE American REFERENCES--- The Native American references felt really out of place and contrived. It's obvious that this director and writer tried tackling an arena they never played in before. They should have stuck to the old adage of \"write about something you know\". IF they are in fact versed in this it certainly did not show on the movie or the beauty of this unique culture was not given proper justice. <br /><br />Clichés and ON THE NOSE--- I agreed to see this film on the basis that it was an indie. So I held it to higher expectations. \"Little Miss Sunshine\" was an indie and saw it before it became so popular. Before it even came out to wide release I was already raving how it's going to be a hit. UNFORTUNATELY I could not say the same about \"Expiration Date\". \"Sunshine\" took us to cliché incidents but the filmmakers were so clever at their approach that the outcome would take us to a different direction avoiding the trap of being a \"cliche\". This movie on the other hand had no way of not falling in the trap because it was already TRAPPED from the start. The psycho mom's antics, the Hendrix couple, etc. <br /><br />I hate to say it, but the best and WORST movie I've seen this year were both indies. \"Little Miss Sunshine\" being the best and this movie being the worst. I wish I could say otherwise. <br /><br />But I do congratulate the filmmakers for having such a good turn out from their family members at the cemetery.","finished_norm":["okai","it","veri","rare","that","i","complain","someth","i","get","for","free","so","i","guess","thi","movi","push","me","over","that","limit","i","see","it","at","the","hollywood","cemeteri","for","free","and","walk","awai","veri","veri","disappoint","on","audienc","member","question","to","the","director","about","us","the","nativ","american","refer","just","a","bookend","instead","of","be","weav","into","the","movi","well","basic","sai","everyth","that","thi","movi","fail","on","br","br","nativ","american","refer","the","nativ","american","refer","feel","realli","out","of","place","and","contriv","it","obviou","that","thi","director","and","writer","try","tackl","a","arena","thei","never","plai","in","befor","thei","should","have","stick","to","the","old","adag","of","write","about","someth","you","know","if","thei","be","in","fact","vers","in","thi","it","certainli","do","not","show","on","the","movi","or","the","beauti","of","thi","uniqu","cultur","be","not","give","proper","justic","br","br","cliché","and","on","the","nose","i","agre","to","see","thi","film","on","the","basi","that","it","be","a","indi","so","i","hold","it","to","high","expect","littl","miss","sunshin","be","a","indi","and","see","it","befor","it","becom","so","popular","befor","it","even","come","out","to","wide","releas","i","be","alreadi","rave","how","it","go","to","be","a","hit","unfortun","i","can","not","sai","the","same","about","expir","date","sunshin","take","u","to","cliché","incid","but","the","filmmak","be","so","clever","at","their","approach","that","the","outcom","would","take","u","to","a","differ","direct","avoid","the","trap","of","be","a","clich","thi","movi","on","the","other","hand","have","no","wai","of","not","fall","in","the","trap","becaus","it","be","alreadi","trap","from","the","start","the","psycho","mom","antic","the","hendrix","coupl","etc","br","br","i","hate","to","sai","it","but","the","well","and","wrong","movi","i","have","see","thi","year","be","both","indi","littl","miss","sunshin","be","the","well","and","thi","movi","be","the","wrong","i","wish","i","can","sai","otherwis","br","br","but","i","do","congratul","the","filmmak","for","have","such","a","good","turn","out","from","their","famili","member","at","the","cemeteri"],"filtered":["okai","veri","rare","complain","someth","get","free","guess","thi","movi","push","limit","see","hollywood","cemeteri","free","walk","awai","veri","veri","disappoint","audienc","member","question","director","us","nativ","american","refer","bookend","instead","weav","movi","well","basic","sai","everyth","thi","movi","fail","br","br","nativ","american","refer","nativ","american","refer","feel","realli","place","contriv","obviou","thi","director","writer","try","tackl","arena","thei","never","plai","befor","thei","stick","old","adag","write","someth","know","thei","fact","vers","thi","certainli","show","movi","beauti","thi","uniqu","cultur","give","proper","justic","br","br","cliché","nose","agre","see","thi","film","basi","indi","hold","high","expect","littl","miss","sunshin","indi","see","befor","becom","popular","befor","even","come","wide","releas","alreadi","rave","go","hit","unfortun","sai","expir","date","sunshin","take","u","cliché","incid","filmmak","clever","approach","outcom","take","u","differ","direct","avoid","trap","clich","thi","movi","hand","wai","fall","trap","becaus","alreadi","trap","start","psycho","mom","antic","hendrix","coupl","etc","br","br","hate","sai","well","wrong","movi","see","thi","year","indi","littl","miss","sunshin","well","thi","movi","wrong","wish","sai","otherwis","br","br","congratul","filmmak","good","turn","famili","member","cemeteri"],"filtered2":["okai","veri","rare","complain","someth","get","free","guess","push","limit","see","hollywood","cemeteri","free","walk","awai","veri","veri","disappoint","audienc","member","question","director","us","nativ","american","refer","bookend","instead","weav","well","basic","everyth","fail","nativ","american","refer","nativ","american","refer","feel","realli","place","contriv","obviou","director","writer","try","tackl","arena","never","plai","befor","stick","old","adag","write","someth","know","fact","vers","certainli","show","beauti","uniqu","cultur","give","proper","justic","cliché","nose","agre","see","basi","indi","hold","high","expect","littl","miss","sunshin","indi","see","befor","becom","popular","befor","even","come","wide","releas","alreadi","rave","go","hit","unfortun","expir","date","sunshin","take","u","cliché","incid","filmmak","clever","approach","outcom","take","u","differ","direct","avoid","trap","clich","hand","wai","fall","trap","becaus","alreadi","trap","start","psycho","mom","antic","hendrix","coupl","etc","hate","well","wrong","see","year","indi","littl","miss","sunshin","well","wrong","wish","otherwis","congratul","filmmak","good","turn","famili","member","cemeteri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,6,13,14,15,20,22,25,2

{"value":"There are some elements that save this movie from being a total catastrophe, but are overshadowed with bad acting, plot holes, deus ex machina thrown ins, stupid dialogs, weak script, and predictable clichés...<br /><br />What we have here is a horror movie with a storyline that goes nowhere for most of the time. A group of unlikely heroes including a black guy that gets it first (yeah, that cliché seems to be still very much alive even in Finland), seem to have trouble trying to exit a mysteriously empty hospital. There are shrieking ghosts (very imaginative), zombies (at one point I thought at least they didn't use zombies, but they came), and Finnish glam-rock band with demonic make-up on, getting in their way. There is also some time-shift doodle present, but it adds up nothing to the storyline. Autistic girl and a hobo seem to have some deeper understanding of a situation, but they never spell it out to the viewer, or their confused friends. Their lines consist only of profound life lesson thoughts like: \"What happens will happen...\" or \"Light can't live in the darkness...\" or the ominous \"I need a red crayon... red crayon.\" So all this characters (including worried father and sweet doctor in distress types) end up doing is running around them dark floors, and from or mistakenly to the demons. Occasionally a ghost or a group of zombies show up, and if it seems a demon keyboardist can't spot a group of six people coming towards it, waving a flashlight and conversing, it was just pretending. And apparently this demon can break through walls without much hassle, but opening elevator door is beyond its capabilities.<br /><br />In the end we even get a \"it was all a dream\" sequence twist.

{"value":"Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and it stars Rick Hill, who is some kind of body builder and famous of that, if I have understood right? The plot follows as Deathstalker (Hill) tries to get something back from the evil lord, and he has to travel to the lord's cave. He meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey, and the settings are very close to Tolkien, and of course Conan the Barbarian. This is a rip off of huge success of Conan, and even though this is very stupid film, it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkies!<br /><br />There are no many cinematic merits in this film. Couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating, but what Deathstalker concentrates to show, are nude females and huge muscles of Hill. Females are usually helpless victims and very stupid, too, so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists! The fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull, and the monsters are not either anything special. And all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done, but what did you expect from low budget effort like this? This tries to be as great as Conan but fails pretty miserably. As I said, this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else. This belongs to the category it's so bad it's great!<br /><br />Deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be, and as a turkey film, I appreciate this almost as much as other turkeys, enjoyable ones of course! If bad films are your cup of tea, then try this and have fun, but if you don't understand \"enjoyably bad films\" then stay away. And if somebody can't stand large amount of nudity, then stay away as well. There is more nudity here than violence, and due to these scenes, the film has an R rating.

{"value":"The TV productions at the 2000's start were between weak and bad. Before marks like (Alias, Lost, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, or Monk) the TV didn't have the right hit yet, which could capture the attention and the interests of the 2000s' viewer. Titles like (Relic Hunter), (Mutant X), (The Lost World), (Sheena), or even (Baywatch Hawaii) weren't encouraging for you to watch and follow, or at least weren't that captivating and interesting all the time as what preceded them. (Special Unit 2) was no exception. In fact it's Men in Black meets The X Files' spoof ! (As if these were the special unit 1). But even according to this brilliant formula; it didn't work well. It was promising; at the time there was some saturation out of the \"supernatural\" cases after a decade of many X files already, so the natural spirit to lampoon it naughtily too (imagine Mulder as womanizer !). However (Special Unit 2) wasn't the strongest in this, or a strong when it comes to make a comic Sci-Fi show. It was highly ridiculous, where for instance every sexy situation must turn into ugly disgusting one. It enjoyed that bad taste sickeningly. (Michael Landes) was non-charismatic and mostly unbearable as a comedian. His chemistry with (Alexondra Lee), as well as any supposed sexual attention, was all languid. Sure the show got a funny look but overall it was unfunny work. It's clear that there was nothing more interesting than its main idea. Among (Evan Katz)'s other works as a co-writer and a co-producer like (Seven Days) before or (24) later this must be a low point !. Despite the distinctive personality, it managed to be a silly jest for most of the time. Therefore if that was there goal, so they made one of the silliest indeed !
