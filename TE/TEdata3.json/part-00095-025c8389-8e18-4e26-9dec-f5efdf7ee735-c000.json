{"value":"I actually retired from Asian horror films some time ago after becoming completely sick of seeing samey ghost story rubbish. However, I've been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently, and so decided to give them another chance. My first port of call was highly rated director Takashi Miike's highly rated 'Visitor Q'. I'd already seen Audition, and while I didn't like it much, I do rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror films. So, I went into this with sensible expectations; and unfortunately, found only boredom. I suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head, but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them. Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous as far as I'm concerned; all Miike has done here is make a film; any intelligence surrounding it has been implemented by pretentious fans, desperate to find some kind of meaning. My headache set in about 10 minutes in (after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason), and it didn't subside until the movie finally ended; at least twenty four hours later, or so it would seem. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around; but while this may be violent, it's also pointless and boring and I didn't get one ounce of enjoyment out of it. Takashi Miike may have a lot of fans, but I'm certainly not one of them; and I certainly hope this is the last time I'll come into contact with one of his films.","finished_norm":["i","actual","retir","from","asian","horror","film","some","time","ago","after","becom","complet","sick","of","see","samei","ghost","stori","rubbish","howev","i","have","be","get","much","and","much","into","exploit","flick","recent","and","so","decid","to","give","them","anoth","chanc","my","port","of","call","be","highli","rate","director","takashi","miik","highli","rate","visitor","q","i","have","alreadi","see","audit","and","while","i","do","not","like","it","much","i","do","rate","it","a","on","of","the","well","modern","asian","horror","film","so","i","go","into","thi","with","sensibl","expect","and","unfortun","find","onli","boredom","i","suppos","thi","movi","be","actual","realli","clever","and","it","just","go","over","my","head","but","what","it","seem","like","to","me","be","simpli","a","collect","of","violent","and","nasti","scene","with","littl","or","no","coher","between","them","ani","comparison","to","the","work","of","lui","bunuel","and","david","lynch","be","blasphem","a","far","a","i","be","concern","all","miik","have","do","here","be","make","a","film","ani","intellig","surround","it","have","be","implem","by","pretenti","fan","desper","to","find","some","kind","of","mean","my","headach","set","in","about","minut","in","after","a","father","have","sex","with","hi","daughter","for","some","reason","and","it","do","not","subsid","until","the","movi","final","end","at","littl","twenti","four","hour","late","or","so","it","would","seem","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","be","not","against","violenc","in","movi","and","in","fact","activ","seek","out","the","much","notori","film","around","but","while","thi","mai","be","violent","it","conjur","pointless","and","bore","and","i","do","not","get","on","ounc","of","enjoy","out","of","it","takashi","miik","mai","have","a","lot","of","fan","but","i","be","certainli","not","on","of","them","and","i","certainli","hope","thi","be","the","last","time","i","will","come","into","contact","with","on","of","hi","film"],"filtered":["actual","retir","asian","horror","film","time","ago","becom","complet","sick","see","samei","ghost","stori","rubbish","howev","get","much","much","exploit","flick","recent","decid","give","anoth","chanc","port","call","highli","rate","director","takashi","miik","highli","rate","visitor","q","alreadi","see","audit","like","much","rate","well","modern","asian","horror","film","go","thi","sensibl","expect","unfortun","find","onli","boredom","suppos","thi","movi","actual","realli","clever","go","head","seem","like","simpli","collect","violent","nasti","scene","littl","coher","ani","comparison","work","lui","bunuel","david","lynch","blasphem","far","concern","miik","make","film","ani","intellig","surround","implem","pretenti","fan","desper","find","kind","mean","headach","set","minut","father","sex","hi","daughter","reason","subsid","movi","final","end","littl","twenti","four","hour","late","seem","get","wrong","violenc","movi","fact","activ","seek","much","notori","film","around","thi","mai","violent","conjur","pointless","bore","get","ounc","enjoy","takashi","miik","mai","lot","fan","certainli","certainli","hope","thi","last","time","come","contact","hi","film"],"filtered2":["actual","retir","asian","horror","time","ago","becom","complet","sick","see","samei","ghost","stori","rubbish","howev","get","exploit","flick","recent","decid","give","anoth","chanc","port","call","highli","rate","director","takashi","miik","highli","rate","visitor","q","alreadi","see","audit","like","rate","well","modern","asian","horror","go","sensibl","expect","unfortun","find","onli","boredom","suppos","actual","realli","clever","go","head","seem","like","simpli","collect","violent","nasti","scene","littl","coher","ani","comparison","work","lui","bunuel","david","lynch","blasphem","far","concern","miik","make","ani","intellig","surround","implem","pretenti","fan","desper","find","kind","mean","headach","set","minut","father","sex","daughter","reason","subsid","final","end","littl","twenti","four","hour","late","seem","get","wrong","violenc","fact","activ","seek","notori","around","mai","violent","conjur","pointless","bore","get","ounc","enjoy","takashi","miik","mai","lot","fan","certainli","certainli","hope","last","time","come","contact"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,6,8,11,13,14,17,19,20,24,25,27,30,34,35,38,39,46,48,52,58,59,72,73,83,88,95,97,98,101,103,108,109,113,115,122,130,140,142,144,149,150,156,174,181,201,202,208,227,249,254,257,330,343,389,426,453,486,531,562,603,606,610,675,727,729,737,778,788,874,896,918,955,966,1026,1047,1052,1098,1238,1275,1421,1526,1574,1700,1766,1806,1850,2086,2399,2735,2754,2772,3311,3545,3777,4244,5232,5273,5741,5879,7317,7433],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"Dr. Seuss would sure be mad right now if he was alive. Cat in the Hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a mindless pile of goop. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, big mistake! Myers proves he can't act in this film. He acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The kids in this movie are all right, somewhere in between the lines of dull and annoying. The story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks and like most movies based on other stories, never tweak with the original story! Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a bad idea. He is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.This movie is like a rejected comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. The film sure does look tacky! Sure there are a funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, mildly funny. At least the Grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good! This film is a cartoonish piece of snot with bright colors and bad mediocre acting. Was Mike Myers even in this movie actually? And another thing, the fish. What is with that stupid fish! First time you see him, he's an actual fish. Next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. But he looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough! This film is a total off target wreck. Good joke, bad joke, bad, bad, bad, good joke! I'm surprised it even had good jokes like the water park ride joke, that was good.

{"value":"Here are some examples of Pat Robertsons dubiously claimed \"relatively good track record\" on predictions<br /><br />In his widely reported comments from the January 2 edition of the Christian Broadcasting Network's The 700 Club, during which he predicted that there would be \"very serious terrorist attacks\" and \"mass killing\" in the United States in the \"second half\" of 2007, host Pat Robertson boasted that he had \"a relatively good track record\" on earlier predictions. But a review of Robertson's 2006 New Year's predictions undermines that claim. He predicted, for example, that:<br /><br />* \"President Bush is going to strengthen.\" WRONG<br /><br />* \"The fall elections will be inconclusive, but the outcome of the war and the success of the economy will leave the Republicans in charge.\" WRONG<br /><br />* \"The war in Iraq is going to come to a successful conclusion. We'll begin withdrawing troops before the end of this year.\" WAY WRONG<br /><br />Further, as a January 3 Associated Press article reported, Robertson has a history of making dubious predictions:<br /><br />The broadcaster predicted in January 2004 that President Bush would easily win re-election. Bush won 51% of the vote that fall, beating Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. WRONG<br /><br />In 2005, Robertson predicted that Bush would have victory after victory in his second term.

{"value":"As the film begins a narrator warns us THE SCREAMING SKULL is so terrifying you might die of fright--and if such happens a free burial is guaranteed. Well, I don't think any one has died of fright from seeing this film, but a few may have died of boredom. THE SCREAMING SKULL is the sort of movie that makes Ed Wood look good.<br /><br />Very loosely based on the famous Francis Marion Crawford story, SKULL is about a wealthy but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances. Once installed in his home, she is tormented by a half-wit gardener, a badly executed portrait, peacocks, and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to scream a lot. And to her credit, actress Peggy Webber screams rather well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, her ability to do so is the high point of the film. The plot is pretty transparent, to say the least, and while the cast is actually okay, the script is dreadful and the movie so uninspired you'll be ready to run screaming yourself. True, the thing only runs about sixty-eight minutes, but it all feels a lot longer. Add to this a truly terrible print quality and there you are.<br /><br />There are films that are so bad they are fun to watch. It is true that THE SCREAMING SKULL has a few howlers--but the film drags so much I couldn't work up more than an occasional giggle, and by the time the whole thing is over your head will roll from ennui. If it weren't for Peggy Webber's way with a scream, this would be the surefire cure for insomnia.

{"value":"Well, I hate hollywood, but love cinema so i have to watch these cruddy movies in theaters. And, I was hoping Vanilla Sky would be good. i was hoping that they would either keep the original \"Open Your Eyes\" exactly the same, or they would make it their own. Well, it happened to be a little bit of both, and it sucked.<br /><br />It started out good. I love Radiohead. I wish there was more of that. But by the end we are listening to Good Vibrations by The Beach Boys. Talk about a wide range of suck between. They had one or two good songs in the club and maybe a couple others, but why oh why did they have to blare GV during the climax. It was more annoying than confusing or blatant. Especially when it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT. At least put some meaning behind the songs. Kid A = primary. Whatever.<br /><br />He also did a bang up job with the club scene. That was cool. Otherwise the movie was one big ball of arrogance. As if audiences would get the movie. The ones that would get it read subtitles, and the rest won't. Its as simple as that. The motivations got all screwed up. I didn't comprehend the Diaz motivations (hadn't they done the Chicken Soup night before?) and some of the others. And I hate Kurt Russell. Stay overboard. Tom Cruise can't act (especially in these types of movie [i.e. Eyes Wide Shut]). And the elevator. I get it. Anyways they tried improving the original with a crappy american rock soundtrack and crappy angles and good film print and glossy processing and it would have helped if crowe hadn't screwed it up.<br

{"value":"I was very disappointed in this 1970 film based on a Bernard Malamud story. This is basically a story of possible redemption, racial bias and the unfulfillment of life based on mistrust.<br /><br />A black Jewish angel is sent to help a struggling tailor and his critically ill wife. If Morris Mishkin (Zero Mostel) will only believe in the angel (Belafonte), his wife Fanny (Ida Kaminska) will recover. The problem is that Morris has basically given up on life and just refuses to believe that Belafonte is an angel.<br /><br />When he believes it, Fanny improves but in the end he has doubts and Fanny suffers accordingly. It would have been very nice if there had been an English translation in the last scene when a dying Fanny speaks to Morris.<br /><br />Jan Kadar, who successfully directed Miss Kaminska in her Oscar nominated brilliant performance in 1966's \"The Shop on Main Street\" directs this film as well. Kaminska is reduced in the film to mostly bed scenes and her kindness in her speech really doesn't convey the desperate situation that she faces. She keeps calling for Ruthie, their daughter, who disobeyed them by marrying out of the Jewish religion. For most of the film, she does not realize the Angel's appearance in her apartment.<br /><br />The scene in the pharmacy is muddled and the scene where the Angel's girl friend confronts Belafonte in

{"value":"Released in 1965, but clearly shot years earlier, this is an inept little crime melodrama with some inept sexploitation up front. As usual for grindhouse flicks of era, there's a fair amount of undressing and dressing for no reason complemented by lousy music, annoying narration, and awkward editing. The coffee shop scene lays the excruciating groundwork, as we chop back and forth between characters to avoid actually seeing them speak their lines. All we get are reaction shots to the off-screen character's voice! 50s-pretty Misty Ayers strips to her French-cut panties a couple of times before the action gets started. She's accompanied continuously by what is apparently stock music from romantic to western to mother-does-the-dishes, mixed randomly to produce, among other things, the most thrilling cigarette lighting ever captured on film. Watch as he taps it! Watch as he strikes the match! Will he inhale or will he be captured by Apaches? Only time will tell!! The film tells the sordid tale of how Sally gets tricked into working in a whorehouse, falls for a dope, and can't escape. For some reason, we're treated to some of the most bored and boring hookers ever committed to film, literally doing their nails or knitting rather than entertaining the clientèle. Some stupendously lame comedy (boozy dame accidentally drinks milk! Har dee har!) and silent film acting doesn't help. This is one of the worst feature films I've ever seen, even on the Something Weird Video marquee.

{"value":"i should qualify that title, now that i think about it. Checkout is not entirely worthless. i've had the opportunity to see it twice, and on the second time i did get a great laugh at the movie's expense. so i guess it's worth something for that. and also it's worthwhile for the excruciating pain it caused me on my first viewing. as another reviewer pointed out, this film is hackneyed in every sense of the word. not a single original thought went into this movie (which makes the comment below about the originality of the premise entirely baffling to me). the film is nothing but a long line of cliches which are strung together and paraded around as a movie. it is definitely not the next Clerks, it is definitely not original, and it is absolutely not \"good, clean fun.\" the film is absolute agony to the uninitiated (after seeing it a first time, the second time can be quite funny, in an insulting sort of way). as i looked around the theater, it was obvious that nearly everyone, barring perhaps the elderly, were completely bored or pained by this movie. during some of the particularly emotional scenes, like where Nick chews out his mother, the audience was actually cringing because it was so poorly done. i even heard someone *groan* in the theater, something i had heretofore never witnessed. i don't care where you have the chance to see this movie, be it at a film festival, or in a indie theater, or wherever. do yourself a favor, skip this movie with a vengeance. unless you're like me and just can't resist the opportunity to see what may truly be the worst movie ever made.","finished_norm":["i","should","qualifi","that","titl","now","that","i","think","about","it","checkout","be","not","entir","worthless","i","have","have","the","opportun","to","see","it","twice","and","on","the","time","i","do","get","a","great","laugh","at","the","movi","expens","so","i","guess","it","worth","someth","for","that","and","conjur","it","worthwhil","for","the","excruci","pain","it","caus","me","on","my","view","a","anoth","review","point","out","thi","film","be","hacknei","in","everi","sens","of","the","word","not","a","singl","origin","think","go","into","thi","movi","which","make","the","comment","below","about","the","origin","of","the","premis","entir","baffl","to","me","the","film","be","noth","but","a","long","line","of","clich","which","be","string","togeth","and","parad","around","a","a","movi","it","be","definit","not","the","next","clerk","it","be","definit","not","origin","and","it","be","absolut","not","good","clean","fun","the","film","be","absolut","agoni","to","the","uniniti","after","see","it","a","time","the","time","can","be","quit","funni","in","a","insult","sort","of","wai","a","i","look","around","the","theater","it","be","obviou","that","nearli","everyon","bar","perhap","the","elderli","be","complet","bore","or","pain","by","thi","movi","dure","some","of","the","particularli","emot","scene","like","where","nick","chew","out","hi","mother","the","audienc","be","actual","cring","becaus","it","be","so","poorli","do","i","even","hear","someon","groan","in","the","theater","someth","i","have","heretofor","never","wit","i","do","not","care","where","you","have","the","chanc","to","see","thi","movi","be","it","at","a","film","festiv","or","in","a","indi","theater","or","wherev","do","yourself","a","favor","skip","thi","movi","with","a","vengeanc","unless","you","re","like","me","and","just","ca","not","resist","the","opportun","to","see","what","mai","truli","be","the","wrong","movi","ever","make"],"filtered":["qualifi","titl","think","checkout","entir","worthless","opportun","see","twice","time","get","great","laugh","movi","expens","guess","worth","someth","conjur","worthwhil","excruci","pain","caus","view","anoth","review","point","thi","film","hacknei","everi","sens","word","singl","origin","think","go","thi","movi","make","comment","origin","premis","entir","baffl","film","noth","long","line","clich","string","togeth","parad","around","movi","definit","next","clerk","definit","origin","absolut","good","clean","fun","film","absolut","agoni","uniniti","see","time","time","quit","funni","insult","sort","wai","look","around","theater","obviou","nearli","everyon","bar","perhap","elderli","complet","bore","pain","thi","movi","dure","particularli","emot","scene","like","nick","chew","hi","mother","audienc","actual","cring","becaus","poorli","even","hear","someon","groan","theater","someth","heretofor","never","wit","care","chanc","see","thi","movi","film","festiv","indi","theater","wherev","favor","skip","thi","movi","vengeanc","unless","re","like","ca","resist","opportun","see","mai","truli","wrong","movi","ever","make"],"filtered2":["qualifi","titl","think","checkout","entir","worthless","opportun","see","twice","time","get","great","laugh","expens","guess","worth","someth","conjur","worthwhil","excruci","pain","caus","view","anoth","review","point","hacknei","everi","sens","word","singl","origin","think","go","make","comment","origin","premis","entir","baffl","noth","long","line","clich","string","togeth","parad","around","definit","next","clerk","definit","origin","absolut","good","clean","fun","absolut","agoni","uniniti","see","time","time","quit","funni","insult","sort","wai","look","around","theater","obviou","nearli","everyon","bar","perhap","elderli","complet","bore","pain","dure","particularli","emot","scene","like","nick","chew","mother","audienc","actual","cring","becaus","poorli","even","hear","someon","groan","theater","someth","heretofor","never","wit","care","chanc","see","festiv","indi","theater","wherev","favor","skip","vengeanc","unless","re","like","ca","resist","opportun","see","mai","truli","wrong","ever","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,8,12,16,19,22,25,33,39,42,44,46,49,51,52,53,62,66,68,69,73,81,85,98,99,103,107,108,120,133,139,168,173,176,198,205,216,219,222,239,243,246,258,259,264,269,270,280,297,312,318,342,383,392,397,398,424,443,452,458,460,484,486,497,506,611,709,851,931,993,1070,1110,1217,1255,1443,1495,1581,1730,1743,1828,1890,2022,2074,2174,2408,2465,2844,3112,3328,3371,3648,3912,4501,4558,5243,6329],"values":[2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"OK, I didn't have high expectations but this film descending into depths I could not imagine.<br /><br />The plot, as it were, involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a Sin Eater. The Sin Eater allows for Catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the Church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui. Nevermind that this makes no sense since then a Baptist could give you salvation....we'll move on.<br /><br />I'll layout the plot w/o giving much away: the priest goes to Rome with his buddy to investogate. He brings with him a mental patient (I'm not making this up) who shot him during an excorism and who loves him (not one lick of this BTW is explained), a drunk Irish priest and Peter Weller as a Cardinal. They get to Rome, find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film, meet with a bondage gear S&M anti-pope that the drunk Irish guy knows (not explained) and who gives information by killing people (oh, BTW, he's a bad guy so he has an industrial/techno soundtrack) and then...umm, seriously, I'm not sure. the plot meanders about. Heath chills with the Sin Eater, flies to New York with the Sin Eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then (all off camera) the anti-pope falls and the film ends.<br /><br />About 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened. By the end something has happened but you can't be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or off-scren you're really feeling cheated.","finished_norm":["okai","i","do","not","have","high","expect","but","thi","film","descend","into","depth","i","can","not","imaginebr","br","the","plot","a","it","be","involv","a","priest","of","a","obscur","member","order","investig","the","death","of","the","founder","of","the","order","by","a","sin","eater","the","sin","eater","allow","for","cathol","to","achiv","salvat","outsid","the","author","of","the","church","and","be","yet","anoth","immort","in","film","with","load","of","ennui","nevermind","that","thi","make","no","sens","sinc","then","a","baptist","can","give","you","salvationwel","move","onbr","br","i","will","layout","the","plot","wo","give","much","awai","the","priest","go","to","rome","with","hi","buddi","to","investog","he","bring","with","him","a","mental","patient","i","be","not","make","thi","up","who","shoot","him","dure","a","excor","and","who","love","him","not","on","lick","of","thi","btw","be","explain","a","drink","irish","priest","and","peter","weller","a","a","cardin","thei","get","to","rome","find","some","creepi","kid","who","do","noth","in","the","film","meet","with","a","bondag","gear","sm","antipop","that","the","drink","irish","gui","know","not","explain","and","who","give","inform","by","kill","peopl","oh","btw","he","a","bad","gui","so","he","have","a","industrialtechno","soundtrack","and","thenumm","serious","i","be","not","sure","the","plot","meander","about","heath","chill","with","the","sin","eater","fly","to","new","york","with","the","sin","eater","for","a","overnight","and","then","some","other","stuff","happen","and","then","all","off","camera","the","antipop","fall","and","the","film","endsbr","br","about","hour","into","the","film","on","realli","wonder","if","anyth","have","happen","by","the","end","someth","have","happen","but","you","ca","not","be","at","all","certain","that","it","matter","and","sinc","much","of","the","drama","take","place","either","befor","the","movei","or","offscren","you","re","realli","feel","cheat"],"filtered":["okai","high","expect","thi","film","descend","depth","imaginebr","br","plot","involv","priest","obscur","member","order","investig","death","founder","order","sin","eater","sin","eater","allow","cathol","achiv","salvat","outsid","author","church","yet","anoth","immort","film","load","ennui","nevermind","thi","make","sens","sinc","baptist","give","salvationwel","move","onbr","br","layout","plot","wo","give","much","awai","priest","go","rome","hi","buddi","investog","bring","mental","patient","make","thi","shoot","dure","excor","love","lick","thi","btw","explain","drink","irish","priest","peter","weller","cardin","thei","get","rome","find","creepi","kid","noth","film","meet","bondag","gear","sm","antipop","drink","irish","gui","know","explain","give","inform","kill","peopl","oh","btw","bad","gui","industrialtechno","soundtrack","thenumm","serious","sure","plot","meander","heath","chill","sin","eater","fly","new","york","sin","eater","overnight","stuff","happen","camera","antipop","fall","film","endsbr","br","hour","film","realli","wonder","anyth","happen","end","someth","happen","ca","certain","matter","sinc","much","drama","take","place","either","befor","movei","offscren","re","realli","feel","cheat"],"filtered2":["okai","high","expect","descend","depth","imaginebr","plot","involv","priest","obscur","member","order","investig","death","founder","order","sin","eater","sin","eater","allow","cathol","achiv","salvat","outsid","author","church","yet","anoth","immort","load","ennui","nevermind","make","sens","sinc","baptist","give","salvationwel","move","onbr","layout","plot","wo","give","awai","priest","go","rome","buddi","investog","bring","mental","patient","make","shoot","dure","excor","love","lick","btw","explain","drink","irish","priest","peter","weller","cardin","get","rome","find","creepi","kid","noth","meet","bondag","gear","sm","antipop","drink","irish","gui","know","explain","give","inform","kill","peopl","oh","btw","bad","gui","industrialtechno","soundtrack","thenumm","serious","sure","plot","meander","heath","chill","sin","eater","fly","new","york","sin","eater","overnight","stuff","happen","camera","antipop","fall","endsbr","hour","realli","wonder","anyth","happen","end","someth","happen","ca","certain","matter","sinc","drama","take","place","either","befor","movei","offscren","re","realli","feel","cheat"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,9,13,23,24,26,30,31,32,38,43,49,53,54,55,68,73,76,79,81,87,94,104,114,117,119,130,155,162,164,169,173,174,175,191,194,207,211,231,234,239,241,245,250,275,350,361,371,395,406,439,463,521,618,652,667,755,760,774,791,796,827,911,914,1043,1111,1113,1130,1252,1296,1302,1405,1686,1914,1975,2083,2084,2085,2245,2480,2510,2672,3356,3599,3634,3872,4344,4810,4932,4960,5716,5788,5923,7511,7538,7595,8577],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"I only watched the first 30 minutes of this and what I saw was a total piece of crap. The scenes I saw were as bad as an Ed Wood movie. No, it was a hundred times WORSE. Ed Wood has the reputation of being the worst director ever but that's not true; the idiot who directed this junk is the WORST director ever.<br /><br />The American cop has a German accent! The \"police station\" was a desk in a warehouse with a sign \"Police Station\" hanging on the wall. There is a fist fight where the punches clearly miss by about TEN FEET.<br /><br />This cop pulls women over, cuffs them and leads them to a warehouse. He tells his cop partner to wait in the car. Then he comes out of the warehouse carrying a duffel bag. The cop partner thinks maybe something is not right, that his partner might be a bad cop who is murdering these women, but he isn't sure if that is what's happening because - he's a moron! The dialog is totally stupid, the acting is awful, and the characters act in the stupidest manner I have ever seen on screen. It is totally obvious to the cop's partner that he is illegally abducting these women and he is slapping them and taking them into a warehouse and returning to the car with a duffel bag with a body in it, and yet, the partner, who is there all along, doesn't know what is happening! <br /><br />The director of this film is a total hack. I stopped the movie at 30 minutes because I couldn't take it anymore. It has to be one of the WORST movies I have ever started to watch and I won't waste anymore time on it writing this review. <br /><br />Absolutely

{"value":"This was director von Stroheim's third effort - it is quite crude and shows none of the exceptional flair for the camera and editing mastery he would display a few years later with his masterworks, GREED and THE WEDDING MARCH. Essentially we have a trio of grifters, masquerading as a Russian count and two Russian princesses who have rented a villa in Monte Carlo. Their aim is to use counterfeit money at the gambling tables and win a fortune. Part of that plan is for the Count (von Stroheim) to insinuate himself between a visiting American ambassador and his \"foolish\" wife, wooing her and hoping to gain some money by playing on her weaknesses. He makes the mistake of also taking the life savings of the maid, whom he has promised to marry. When she sees them together, she sets fire to the room, (von Stroheim and his prey are on the room's balcony). Here von Stroheim first establishes his persona as \"the man you love to hate.\" He is thoroughly bad and his character flaws eventually bring him to a very bad and deserved end. The film is crude in its cinematography and editing and not worth seeing unless you are fascinated by the director. There is a cute bit- when he first attempts to meet the Ambassador's wife, she is reading a book - we see the title - FOOLISH WIVES by Erich von Stroheim. This was originally envisioned as a 210 minute film, cut down to 140 minutes by the studio and finally released at 70 minutes. The restoration on Kino Video restores surviving footage (damaged in some way in most scenes) from the alternate earlier version to give us a 107 minute

{"value":"First, I realize that a \"1\" rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst. This movie gets that from me because, as one reviewer points out, it's not bad in a self-aware, over-the-top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value. It simply misses its mark on every count. **Contains possible spoilers** The dialog is completely disingenuous. The continuity is so deliberate it's painful. Daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love, and with his final word the flamenco dancers start. The mock-shock of what's her name (see? I don't even remember her character's name, let alone the name of the forgettable actress) when her husband (the Baldwin) first tells her that her friend is the bad guy. The car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things. Vegetable carts gone flying. Cars crashing into each other. Motorcycles going down the stairs. People nearly being hit, but remarkably, no one is. Oh, that's right... except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times, is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds, and an approaching car apparently didn't notice him there. Hmmm. <br /><br />It's becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made. There is so much pressure in the film industry to make money, you'd think that someone in Hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing. Now there's a novel idea. <br /><br />My suggestion: don't see this film. Don't rent the DVD. Don't watch it on cable. There are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more

{"value":"Larry Buchanan. Yep, same guy who did \"Attack of the THE Eye Creatures\" and two (count 'em: TWO) conspiracy movies about Marilyn Monroe. He's to blame, here.<br /><br />Adding onto his ever-growing pile of folders left over from Oliver Stone's \"eh-I-grew-out-of-it\" conspiracy drawer, here's \"Down On Us (i.e.- \"Beyond the Doors\") which is the working definition of historical inaccuracy.<br /><br />Forget everything you THOUGHT you knew about Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison, says Big Lar', cuz this is the real deal! Y'see, the three big names in rock of the '60s were KILLED BY THE GOVERNMENT because they were subversives or counter-productive to Truth, Justice and the American Way, or sumpthin' like that there. I knew it all along.<br /><br />Anyway, three people (Chatman, Meryl, Wolf) who look eerily like their real life shadows (that is, if you completely close your eyes, turn your backs and walk five miles away from them) show that instead of their recorded deaths, the good old US of A put hits out on them! Yep, it's the truth!<br /><br />Man, I cannot believed I watched this movie. It's facts, when not stretching credibility to the snapping point, are ludicrous; the acting makes TV commercials look like high drama and if you honestly watch it through to the end, you deserve the \"twist\" ending. You really, really do; I swear.

{"value":"With a title like that, it's above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did NOT appeal to me. Granted, there's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse \"shock\" tactics... The inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. He and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a \"grabby\" neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he is going to kill them all. She winds up killing HIM and then turning her focus towards the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills, herself... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. The best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man-rape... Surely, \"I Spit on Your Corpse, I P!ss on Your Grave\" was intended as an unofficial sequel to \"I Spit on Your Grave\" - based on, mainly the title, and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton. I personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion!

{"value":"Race car drivers say that 100 mph seems fast till you've driven 150, and 150 mph seems fast till you've driven 250.<br /><br />OK.<br /><br />Andalusian Dog seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen Eraserhead, and Eraserhead seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen Begotten.<br /><br />And Begotten seems breathtakingly bizarre till you've seen the works of C. Frederic Hobbs. Race fans, there is NOTHING in all the world of film like the works of C. Frederic Hobbs.<br /><br />Alabama's Ghost comes as close as any of his films to having a coherent plot, and it only involves hippies, rock concerts, voodoo, ghosts, vampires, robots, magicians, corrupt multinational corporations, elephants and Mystery Gas. And the Fabulous Woodmobile, cruising the Sunset District in San Francisco, of course.<br /><br />What's really startling is that somebody gave him a LOT of money to make Alabama's Ghost. There's sets, lighting, hundreds of extras, costumes, lots and lots of effects. Somehow that makes Alabama's Ghost SO WRONG. You watch some awful cheeseball like Night of Horror or Plutonium Baby, and at least some part of the weirdness is excusable on the basis that they were obviously making the film off the headroom on their Discover cards. But Alabama's Ghost was made with an actual budget, and that's EVIL. I mean, I've got a script about a tribe of cannibals living in Thunder Bay, Ontario, building a secret temple in the woods out of Twizzlers, and nobody's beating down MY door waving a checkbook - how

{"value":"Nicolas Roeg ? He directed the classic supernatural thriller DON`T LOOK NOW didn`t he ? Strangely the aforementioned movie was broadcast on BBC television at the weekend which did tonight`s screening of COLD HEAVEN no favours what so ever . <br /><br />You see it`s impossible not to compare COLD HEAVEN with DON`T LOOK NOW since they both have the same director and the same structure and for the first third of COLD HEAVEN I thought they also had the same plot except a dead husband had been substituted instead of a dead child , in fact my mind was set on this movie revolving around a grief stricken widow seeing her late husband running around Venice wearing a red anorak . This doesn`t occur but about one third of the way through the running time there`s a massive plot twist and despite being an essential plot twist it`s not explained in any great depth . In fact very little is explained in COLD HEAVEN which ruins the movie <br /><br />People have mentioned the rather poor production values of COLD HEAVEN and it`s impossible not to notice them . If I didn`t no different I would have thought this was a TVM since it`s got a made for television feel to it right down to white capital letters in the title sequence . Roeg also tries to inject art house pretentions via spoken thought processes but again this doesn`t help the movie at all .

{"value":"I think this movie was supposed to be shocking. But the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it's been made ...and simply is. It's one-and-a-half hour of torment. Even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie (the five girls).<br /><br />Sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way, which is basically fine, since it's a horror-movie. And I (usually) like horror-movies. I've no problem with violence in these type of movies per se. However all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever. It's no spectacle other than that it's simply grotesque. It's so lame it even gets boring, and really quick too.<br /><br />The worst thing (if the above wasn't bad enough for ya) about this movie is that they've tried to copy the Blair Whitch Project, by filming with cheap hand-held-cameras. But (again, this too) serves no end whatsoever. In the \"Blair Which\", sure enough, there's an explanation, namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch. In this film, there's no other explanation than: \"Hey ya'll we wanted this to LOOK LIKE the Blair Whitch!!\" The sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about. The girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can't make out what they're saying. Also, no effort has been made to make anything any better, sound-wise or other wise.<br /><br />Than finally, there's the soundtrack, which is just as bad as the rest, and varies from cheap euro-house to the worst grungy hard-rock...<br /><br />My advise: Don't watch this under ANY

{"value":"Kind of hard to believe that the movie from this book could succeed in topping its awfulness! The plot is so contrived and unbelievable. . . starting with laying a ton of guilt on a small child to spare her pain! Then we have the collusive behavior of at least six and maybe more people(including clergy) involved in what is a crime everywhere. Next we have a wife who seemingly in the length of a ferry ride goes from being comparatively happy to very shortly kicking over the traces. A very unpleasant and coo coo mother, aided, abetted and supported by a politically correct group of friends! Moving the setting from an island off the coast of South Carolina, did not help the story although it may have helped the film makers budget. The very beautiful buildings supposedly housing the monastery did not seem to logically suit an island small enough to need golf carts and such a small ferry service. Kim Basinger whom I do really like is painfully thin in this movie and her hairdo certainly belongs in another decade. Also there is simply no chemistry at all between her and either of the male leads. I thoroughly disliked the book from which this was taken but did read it all. The movie I kept surfing back and forth to, had to leave whenever that saccharine music got too much. Unless you like an unbelievable story, wooden acting, a contorted mixture of religious/mythological/allegory my advice is to skip this one. Oh and maybe a small carping criticism, but wouldn't a caring father have a life jacket on a small child on a small boat?

{"value":"I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say this was extremely mediocre (at its best). The dialogue doesn't explain the story very well, and I was left feeling like there were a lot of plot holes. There isn't one likable character in this adaptation due to poor acting. I just find that all of the characters are way too possessive when it comes to someone they love. Also, Cate and Heath's love seems very incestuous. They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers. I don't understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.<br /><br />I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films, but like I said, it's extremely hard to like any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was horrid which was a complete shocker. She was terrible at being the bitchy older sister of Edward, and there just wasn't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, but came off as whiny and overdramatic.<br /><br />I just didn't enjoy this movie very much or the music in it. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band, MxPx, but that small appearance would not convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not.

{"value":"Coyote Ugly might have been much more effective if the film-makers had made it an R-rated guilty pleasure/exploitation film (with plenty of nudity.) But since the PG-13 rating is what all the studios are wanting these days, we end up with a movie like this: a PG-13 \"tease\" flick that isn't allowed to go nowhere near as far as the movie should have gone.<br /><br />The script is go generic that it is easy to guess what plot point is going to occur 15 minutes before it actually happens. The acting is adequate, but the characters are so paper-thin that nothing could be done with them. There were also a lot of points where it seemed like I was watching a music-video rather than a movie.<br /><br />The film's only assets are the amazingly beautiful female leads. We get to see them in some extremely tight and pretty revealing outfits.....but only so much could be shown due to the PG-13 constraints. There's plenty of cleavage and toned, heaving bodies doing some well-choreographed dance numbers, but there's no nudity or sex to speak of. Tyra Banks (she keeps getting even more insanely beautiful with age) is also in the movie for a very small amount of time. Sexy newcomer Piper Perabo is also very easy on the eyes (and she has a killer smile) and shows some genuine acting potential.<br /><br />The only people I could see this movie appealing to is pre-pubescent boys who aren't allowed to watch R-rated movies yet. That audience might get a lot out of it from a titillation aspect, but adult audiences will feel annoyed and cheated.<br /><br />Rating: the movie-1 the

{"value":"This is absurd - aside from the fellow Australian who has reviewed this flick, I can't help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of Elektra, considering how generous they were with their praise.<br /><br />Admittedly I'm not really a fan of comic-book-to-movie conversions so I didn't go in with many expectations, yet still I found Elektra to be incredibly underwhelming. The thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was SO MUCH in this film which went by unexplained, that left you thinking \"huh, what relevance does that have to the plot?\" or \"so how did that aspect of the character come about?\" I can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in Daredevil, which I have no intention of seeing.<br /><br />Furthermore, the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about-face at random moments to suit the storyline, and don't even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub-plot. I'm also (still) scratching my head over the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, which seems to have gone by unexplained.<br /><br />If I can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot, but otherwise I gained little enjoyment from Elektra. I know we're supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy/action films, but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing (even by action film standards) that it simply frustrated me.<br /><br />Well, hell, at least Jennifer Garner looks damn

{"value":"I've just had the evidence that confirmed my suspicions. A bunch of kids, 14 to 22 put on the DVD of \"Titanic\" on a fantastic state of the art mega screen home entertainment type deal. Only two of them had actually seen it before. But they all had seen the moment of Kate, Leo and Celine Dion so many times that most of them felt they had seen the whole movie. Shortly after the epic started, they started to get restless, some of them left asking the others -- \"call us when the iceberg appears\" Over an hour and a half into the movie, only the two girls who had seen the movie before, were still there. They started shouting: iceberg, iceberg. A stampede followed, they all came back to see the sinking of the Titanic. They sat open mouthed, emitting Ohs and far outs. So, just like I thought when the movie first burst into the scene. What is this? One and a half hours waiting for the bloody thing to sink but what about the rest of the of it. Dr. Zivagho, for instance, had a similar running time, but think how much takes place in that film within the same period of time. In \"Titanic\" Leo teaches Kate how to spit. Look at the faces and hands of the, supposedly, creme de la creme in the first class dining room of the ship. Look at the historical details, if you can find them. The storyline is so thin that they have to introduce guns and shootings in a ship that is about to sink. The real sinking here is of film standards. All the efforts are focus on special effects and opening week ends.

{"value":"This star-studded British/Spanish co-production looks great, what you can see of it. I have three versions, two VHS, one DVD, and all are terribly cropped, so badly that it looks as if buildings are having conversations with each other. Few films suffer as badly from pan and scan as this one, as director Robert Parrish seems to have been so enamored with the widescreen process that he tended to use both sides of the screen at once, neglecting the middle. Another user comments that we see the entire inhabitants of a church massacred at the beginning; not in any of the copies I have. There are some abrupt cuts of peasants firing their rifles, one Mexican officer is shot, Shaw and Landau celebrating, and that's it. We never find out why Shaw has become a priest (if he really is), we never find out what happens to Don Carlos (Savalas) although I suspect he was called home to star in Kojak, as his departure seems arbitrary. And there is a strange flashback sequence where Michael Craig (Mysterious Island) is dancing around in a bowler hat and bad suit in the great old English music hall tradition to the 1960 hit BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS, not sung by Johnny Horton here but with some lyrics I've never heard before. On the plus side, the location is great, a huge old ruined fortress with Escher-style stairs leading nowhere, some nice scenery-chewing by Robert Shaw, and good performances by Stevens, Landau, Lettieri, and Telly Savalas as Telly Savalas. I didn't really like this film, but I haven't exactly seen it.

{"value":"Even for a tired movie model as the nature vs. man cycle that prevailed so predominantly in the 1970s, ants falls miserably short of being even somewhat effective(though entertaining for reasons it was not intending). It is sooooo preposterous. Apparently these ants that are bulldozed near an inn have been eating poisonous waste for decades and have now adapted by emitting poisonous bites - hundreds of these bites being fatal. Watching actors of some notoriety clumsily fall amidst tiny black specks is painfully funny in a not-so-good-but very-bad way. So many scenes just look ludicrous: a boy trying to fall in a dumpster whilst being attacked, Suzanne Sommers crying out in horror while lounging in bed, Robert Foxworth and Lynda George breathing through pieces of wallpaper, Bernie Casey faking a gam leg, and the list goes on and on. The peril shown ranges from ants crawling from a drain to black lines of ants all over the walls. The cast for the film is not bad on paper, but none of these actors seem to believe in the material. Poor Myrna Loy has to sit in a wheelchair through this horror. I hope she found a good use for the money, for it is obvious that was the ONLY reason a woman of her pedigree would be in this nonsense. Although it is quite a bad film, it is watchable - once for me, and does have many of those seventies bad film qualities - start-studded actors embarrassing themselves, that made-for-TV feel, and the dreaded creatures of nature reeking vengeance on man.

{"value":"Why review good movies when you can review \"Trancers II?\"<br /><br />Ooh, this film is soooo lame. I can just picture the cast and crew driving around L.A. with a camcorder, hurling extras in silly monster make-up at poor, long-suffering Tim Thomerson. The stars' families actually turn up to play cameos, probably because Full Moon couldn't afford \"real\" extras. Lame effects, lame sets, and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots - this must be classic Trancers!<br /><br />And yet...and yet...it rules. Note this is the same thing I say about \"Trancers IV.\" I say it because it's true. What can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies, then bust out with quips like, \"Don't worry ladies, they're bio-degradable\"? Well, lots of things could be better, but anyway this is still good stuff.<br /><br />My only significant reservation is Megan Ward, who really stinks up the joint. She's a lousy rival for Helen Hunt's character - they're both young pieces of eye candy, and it would've been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more. Oh well, you can't have everything. At least the wonderful plot device of the \"long second watch\" is back in place, and we've got more of Hap Ashby, the least-convincing athlete in the history of cinema (oh, wait a minute - he's got a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in \"Creator\").<br /><br />I haven't seen this lately, but I do seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away twice during the final battle.

{"value":"Opening scene 'explains' why Hurt is later 'immune' to the 'Contaminated Man'. Too bad it doesn't explain anything else: How did he get whatever he 'caught'/what was it/why does it work so fast. Then we go to \"Present Day Budapest\". OK, was the opener in the past or the future? It turns out to be the past, of course, but for a minute it looks just as likely to be the nd of the movie moved to the beginning. Sorry, I should have paid closer attention, huh? Or maybe it's just badly done. Then a lot of confusion about the different jobs he's had in related fields, and finally a mention about how he should have died from the original experiment the n s a did on him. Aha! So the n s a and private industry got together to poison one of their top guys to watch the effects? He must have been one of the top guys, he's friends with the c e o of the Chemical company, for God sakes. Then there's the substance itself: Technically a poison, but it mutates in immune 'carriers', so we can have whatever we want; a poison, a disease, an allergic reaction, all very different things in real life. Magically, it's not contagious from one dying victim to another, only from the carrier. How convenient. Then there's the h a z m a t protocol: They jump into a situation without having any idea what's in store, or how prepare for it. Did the producers not have enough money to show a proper wash-down after the crew just left the scene of a deadly unknown substance? I kept thinking Hurt was going to die from bad cleanup technique, and the open scene would turn out to be the closer after

{"value":"CAMILLE 2000 <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Panavision)<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />Whilst visiting Rome, an amorous nobleman (Nino Castelnuovo) falls in love with a beautiful young libertine (Daniele Gaubert), but their unlikely romance is opposed by Castelnuovo's wealthy father (Massimo Serato), and Fate deals a tragic blow...<br /><br />A sexed-up love story for the swinging Sixties, adapted from a literary source (Alexandre Dumas' 'La Dame aux Camelias') by screenwriter Michael DeForrest, and directed with freewheeling flair by Radley Metzger who, along with the likes of Russ Meyer and Joe Sarno, is credited with redefining the parameters of 'Adult' cinema throughout the 1960's and 70's. Using the scope format for the last time in his career, Metzger's exploration of 'la dolce vita' is rich in visual excess (note the emphasis on reflective surfaces, for example), though the film's sexual candor seems alarmingly coy by modern standards. Production values are handsome throughout, and the performances are engaging and humane (Castelnuovo and Gaubert are particularly memorable), despite weak post-sync dubbing. Though set in an unspecified future, Enrico Sabbatini's wacked-out set designs locate the movie firmly within its period, and Piero Piccioni's 'wah-wah' music score has become something of a cult item amongst exploitation devotees. Ultimately, CAMILLE 2000 is an acquired taste, but fans of this director's elegant softcore erotica won't be disappointed. Next up for Metzger was THE LICKERISH QUARTET (1970), which many consider his best film.","finished_norm":["camil","br","br","aspect","ratio","panavisionbr","br","sound","format","monobr","br","whilst","visit","rome","a","amor","nobleman","nino","castelnuovo","fall","in","love","with","a","beauti","young","libertin","daniel","gaubert","but","their","unlik","romanc","be","oppos","by","castelnuovo","wealthi","father","massimo","serato","and","fate","deal","a","tragic","blowbr","br","a","sexedup","love","stori","for","the","swing","sixti","adapt","from","a","literari","sourc","alexandr","duma","la","dame","aux","camelia","by","screenwrit","michael","deforrest","and","direct","with","freewheel","flair","by","radlei","metzger","who","along","with","the","like","of","russ","meyer","and","joe","sarno","be","credit","with","redefin","the","paramet","of","adult","cinema","throughout","the","and","us","the","scope","format","for","the","last","time","in","hi","career","metzger","explor","of","la","dolc","vita","be","rich","in","visual","excess","note","the","emphasi","on","reflect","surfac","for","exampl","though","the","film","sexual","candor","seem","alarmingli","coi","by","modern","standard","product","valu","be","handsom","throughout","and","the","perform","be","engag","and","human","castelnuovo","and","gaubert","be","particularli","memor","despit","weak","postsync","dub","though","set","in","a","unspecifi","futur","enrico","sabbatini","wackedout","set","design","locat","the","movi","firmli","within","it","period","and","piero","piccioni","wahwah","music","score","have","becom","someth","of","a","cult","item","amongst","exploit","devote","ultim","camil","be","a","acquir","tast","but","fan","of","thi","director","eleg","softcor","erotica","wo","not","be","disappoint","next","up","for","metzger","be","the","lickerish","quartet","which","mani","consid","hi","well","film"],"filtered":["camil","br","br","aspect","ratio","panavisionbr","br","sound","format","monobr","br","whilst","visit","rome","amor","nobleman","nino","castelnuovo","fall","love","beauti","young","libertin","daniel","gaubert","unlik","romanc","oppos","castelnuovo","wealthi","father","massimo","serato","fate","deal","tragic","blowbr","br","sexedup","love","stori","swing","sixti","adapt","literari","sourc","alexandr","duma","la","dame","aux","camelia","screenwrit","michael","deforrest","direct","freewheel","flair","radlei","metzger","along","like","russ","meyer","joe","sarno","credit","redefin","paramet","adult","cinema","throughout","us","scope","format","last","time","hi","career","metzger","explor","la","dolc","vita","rich","visual","excess","note","emphasi","reflect","surfac","exampl","though","film","sexual","candor","seem","alarmingli","coi","modern","standard","product","valu","handsom","throughout","perform","engag","human","castelnuovo","gaubert","particularli","memor","despit","weak","postsync","dub","though","set","unspecifi","futur","enrico","sabbatini","wackedout","set","design","locat","movi","firmli","within","period","piero","piccioni","wahwah","music","score","becom","someth","cult","item","amongst","exploit","devote","ultim","camil","acquir","tast","fan","thi","director","eleg","softcor","erotica","wo","disappoint","next","metzger","lickerish","quartet","mani","consid","hi","well","film"],"filtered2":["camil","aspect","ratio","panavisionbr","sound","format","monobr","whilst","visit","rome","amor","nobleman","nino","castelnuovo","fall","love","beauti","young","libertin","daniel","gaubert","unlik","romanc","oppos","castelnuovo","wealthi","father","massimo","serato","fate","deal","tragic","blowbr","sexedup","love","stori","swing","sixti","adapt","literari","sourc","alexandr","duma","la","dame","aux","camelia","screenwrit","michael","deforrest","direct","freewheel","flair","radlei","metzger","along","like","russ","meyer","joe","sarno","credit","redefin","paramet","adult","cinema","throughout","us","scope","format","last","time","career","metzger","explor","la","dolc","vita","rich","visual","excess","note","emphasi","reflect","surfac","exampl","though","sexual","candor","seem","alarmingli","coi","modern","standard","product","valu","handsom","throughout","perform","engag","human","castelnuovo","gaubert","particularli","memor","despit","weak","postsync","dub","though","set","unspecifi","futur","enrico","sabbatini","wackedout","set","design","locat","firmli","within","period","piero","piccioni","wahwah","music","score","becom","someth","cult","item","amongst","exploit","devote","ultim","camil","acquir","tast","fan","director","eleg","softcor","erotica","wo","disappoint","next","metzger","lickerish","quartet","mani","consid","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,8,17,20,35,50,53,54,56,58,86,102,105,109,115,118,135,140,144,169,178,187,190,292,297,307,317,324,325,343,356,379,391,406,409,438,451,466,468,497,511,518,519,560,615,616,635,645,672,681,701,729,734,735,743,766,775,821,844,872,892,918,933,937,943,949,1074,1167,1291,1499,1532,1588,1697,1842,1873,1919,2078,2144,2195,2281,2356,2498,2521,2726,2986,3280,3300,

{"value":"I can't believe that Steven Segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4th rate films with 5th rate secondary actors. I watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does. When he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong.<br /><br />The plot is unbelievable as a movie, and even if you excuse the visuals, and had read this story as a novel, you'd be left wondering why you had even picked up the book.<br /><br />Steven Segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation. He shows no effort and no enthusiasm, and in some scenes he doesn't show up at all.<br /><br />I hate to repeat other peoples comments, but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic. The condition of those scenes chopped in, is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time. The zappruder film showing President John F Kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner.<br /><br />My honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie, it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds. I read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget (Segal being paid 5 of that) and that the movie still came in under budget. I must concur.<br /><br />It is no wonder that this is a direct to DVD movie, as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie

{"value":"Now, I flicked onto this just out of curiosity and had to keep watching - in the same way that you watch a car crash...<br /><br />I appreciate the fact it's a spoof, but that should not stop me from criticising the god-awful directing, acting and dialogue. Seriously, this rated as one of the poorest movies I have seen - it looked more like an episode of Tales from the Cryptkeeper, and a poor one at that...<br /><br />Okay - a few criticisms (1) when the doctor had his heart attack in front of the monster (we never see the monster attack him, so we assume its a heart attack), the army then launch shells, rockets, bullets at the monster - which was feet from the doctor - yet the doctor is not touched by any missile and is still alive (2) the army attack from about 100 yards away, and we see a flame-thrower being used - geez, those things have a range of no more than 30 metres! (3) when the monster tries to take the professor, the soldiers run into the classroom and fire into the ceiling; the monster drops the kid, and the soldiers don't try to shoot the monster??? come on! (4) the monster looks like it something out of Power Rangers! (5) there is one scene where the five \"good guys\" (the priest, the girl, the doctor, the reporter and the kid) all look shocked and we get reactions (along the lines of hand to mouth) one after the other - so natural!

{"value":"A group of friends come face-to-face with a family of hideous cannibals whilst camping in the beautiful German countryside.<br /><br />The 'mutant cannibal family' concept is almost as old as the hills that the inbred freaks often call home, so any director attempting to breath new life into the genre needs to come up with something pretty darn special in order to impress. With Barricade, Timo Rose tries to give the well-worn routine a Teutonic twist, by transplanting the action to The Black Forest and giving it the German low-budget splatter treatment. The result is a very bloody, but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unwatchable thanks to some dreadful directorial decisionsin particular, the non-stop use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques.<br /><br />Had Timo Rose not opted to utilise every naff trick his editing software offered him, then Barricade might have been a reasonably entertaining gore-fest: his inexperienced cast do reasonably well; the bloody effects are suitably stomach churning; and there are one or two scares and even some well conceived creepy moments. All of this, however, is completely ruined by the awful camera-work, choppy editing, and overwhelming barrage of visual gimmickry used to give the film the distressed look that is so inexplicably popular with today's film-makers.<br /><br />I give Barricade 3 out of 10 purely for the outlandish gore, which includes a nifty scene where a guy is forced to drink acid, loads of nasty wounds caused

{"value":"This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Worse than the most abhorrent American dross; worse than Glitter - Mariah Carey in American dross par excellence. I can only imagine that the writer and producer were taking huge amounts of recreational pharmaceuticals, and when discussing the plot actually thought it was a good idea. it's not. It is abject rubbish from very bowels of Satan himself (who could probably have written a better script had he put his mind to it). Robert Jones as Exce Producer, spending our tax payers money (lottery money folks) on this piece of nonsense, should be accountable. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to re-make Deathline??? I ask you - camp as a Christmas Tree, Deathline ... 'Mind the doors' is classic of really bad British film, we really don't need a reminder. And we certainly don't need a poor, second rate, badly scripted, badly developed and badly piece of rubbish like this. All this this from the UK funding agency that brought us Sex Lives of the Potato Men... I rest my case.<br /><br />Do Not Pay ANY money to see this. It is absolute and utter crap - the one saving grace for the producers is that they got a huge wedge of cash... our cash... for making it. They should hang their heads in shame.<br /><br />I am staggered at the low, low standard of this film. It makes me Mgr that our national body for the support of film actually thought it was worth supporting. There is no hope for the British film industry whilst idiots are running the show.

{"value":"I've seen about four other Japanese horror films and they weren't too impressive. However, I could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the way.<br /><br />Not here, no way. This is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening. When he finds a suspect to question, the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost. Then, the ghost starts to follow the detective around FOR A REASON THAT IS NEVER EXPLAINED AND TAKES UP MORE THAN HALF OF THE MOVIE.<br /><br />Bad enough? Oh no. The film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who don't have much to do with the story. I've seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective. Not the case here.<br /><br />Also, whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends. For example, there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up and...then it just cuts to another scene. I'm aware that this can be a dramatic effect. That's definitely not the intention here. It's just bad editing.<br /><br />Finally, there's the \"ghost\" who just screams in a way that's not scary or unintentionally funny. It's annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie.<br /><br />All of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming. Then after one of them, the movie is over. At that point, a wave of confusion swept over the audience as I could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time. Someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued. It was better than the whole film.
