{"value":"*** WARNING! SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN! ***<br /><br /> This is a semi-autobiographical look at what might happen to Madonna if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island. There's absolutely no challenge to Madonna in this role, and it shows. She's just Madonna playing Madonna, and she can't even get THAT right. I know what you're saying, you're saying, \"How do you know this is what Madonna is really like, you've never met her!\" Correct, I haven't, but we all remember \"Truth or Dare\", don't we? I know Kevin Costner does.<br /><br /> You would think, in the year 2002, that Madonna might have learned something, one way or the other, from the \"crossover\" ladies that have also made their way across the silver screen. For goodness' sake, hasn't Madonna seen \"Glitter\"? Mariah Carey showed the film world HOW IT IS DONE!!! Mariah kicks Madonna's trashy butt to the curb in beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, you name it! All we see from this glimpse into Madonna's world is she's the only one in it. <br /><br /> If there's one thing to be said for Madonna, it is that she's consistent. When she was an MTV darling, she set the world of women's fashion back 20 years. Now, in film, she has set women's roles in film AND society back 20 years, by glamourizing all the most hated, horrible, reprehensible, odious qualities women have been reputed to have locked away inside them, qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really don't possess.<br /><br /> ***HERE'S THE SPOILERS!!! DON'T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW...***<br /><br /> Here's the one good thing I will say about this film, and I really was impressed by it. They didn't go for the \"Hollywood Ending\" - Madonna's character lives. In the typical, happy Hollywood ending, Madonna's character would have died on the island, and her long-suffering, oppressed, whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good, decent woman, a woman who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife, and they both live happily ever after. But in this extremely depressing conclusion, she is rescued, and once more, this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife, and his life will once again become a living hell.<br /><br /> *** HERE ENDETH THE SPOILERS

{"value":"When I first saw the trailer for Prom Night, I have to admit, the trailer looked good and like this would be a fun horror movie. So my friend and I saw Prom Night last night and I have to say I must be growing up because this was such a ridicules film, not to mention I am so sick and tired of the typical horror slasher movies with the loud noises as an excuse to scare people. There was no tension, the characters, how was I supposed to care about them? They had no development what-so-ever, the killer?! Oh, my God, this was very possibly the most stupid serial killer that has ever existed, I know it's a film, but why would a man who never(or at least we know of) killed any one before, kill a girl's family and friends that he's just obsessed over? I mean, was he going to kidnap her or was he going to kill her? I have no idea, because this film made no sense and is too predictable and insulting to true fans of horror.<br /><br />Donna's family was just brutally murdered by her teacher, who has become very obsessed over her, he was captured and put in jail. It's been 3 years and she's just now getting some peace in her life, she's even going to her senior prom. But the killer has escaped and still has Donna on his mind, he follows her to her prom which means bad news for her friends, and the hotel maid, and the bell boy, because it is such a good idea to kill the maid and bell boy so no one become suspicious enough to check to see where these employee's are. Donna is in big trouble because also this killer who is clearly human can apparently get into houses un-noticed and can kill people so silently, just, wow.<br /><br />I'm sorry, I really did want to love this movie, we haven't had a good slasher flick in a long time, but this was just a stupid movie that I was not impressed with. Just the situations were unbelievable and the actors were obnoxious. I know that this was a PG-13 movie, but I just love how someone was brutally stabbed to death and they only have just a little blood on their clothes? Not to mention no stab holes? I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone unless you're a teen, this movie was made for the teenagers, not adults, and not for those who know a real horror movie, no offense to those who did enjoy this film, but I don't understand how anyone could.<br /><br

{"value":"I read one other review that expressed the view that Platoon was a never ending cycle of marines killing people, being killed, taking drugs and talking trash.<br /><br />I don't agree with that because the film actually had more to it, but it a way, I can see what this person is trying to say: this had no real plot - which is a point i agree with.<br /><br />It is self-indulgent Stone at his best. He really wanted to show, not only how war leads to death, but also how it is extremely traumatic on those who survive. Unfortunately, the film seems to over \"glorify\" this aspect and the grand finale is just way too champagne, grand-standing, Oscar-hunting \"let's create an enduring image\" for my liking.<br /><br />The problem I have with Stone and other film-makers of his ilk is that they fail to understand this simply concept: depicting the terribly bloody deadly waste that war is DOES NOT PROVE OR EVEN REFLECT ON WHETHER it was an unjust or immoral war. We have seen the same thing emerge at the moment with Iraq. In case you're missing the point, let me put it to you bluntly: if you saw how truly bloody the second world war was and how destructive it was on the lives of the surviving soldiers, would you think it was an unjust war? If that fact alone doesn't convince you that it was an unjust war, then why should depictions of the horrors of Vietnam convince you that it was wrong to go to war in that instance. <br /><br />Personally, I do not support America's decision to go to war in Vietnam, but i certainly don't subscribe to the \"this war is wrong because people died and suffered\" theory. I don't think that motivations are always wrong by default, just because war in itself is terrible.<br /><br />This says nothing of the fact that the ending or the final big \"twist\" was a bit stupid. However, this is not Stones first oddball departure. Wall street was a magnificent film, up until the last 30 minutes or so when it made a dreadful \"wrong turn.\" JFK is probably one of the few films Stone did that actually ended very well.<br /><br />But it hardly matters in this one because there was very little plot up until that point of the film to twist around. And this is why i gave it such a low mark. It was virtually story-less and ultimately boring - unless you fell for the manufactured poignancy.","finished_norm":["i","read","on","other","review","that","express","the","view","that","platoon","be","a","never","end","cycl","of","marin","kill","peopl","be","kill","take","drug","and","talk","trashbr","br","i","do","not","agre","with","that","becaus","the","film","actual","have","much","to","it","but","it","a","wai","i","can","see","what","thi","person","be","try","to","sai","thi","have","no","real","plot","which","be","a","point","i","agre","withbr","br","it","be","selfindulg","stone","at","hi","well","he","realli","want","to","show","not","onli","how","war","lead","to","death","but","conjur","how","it","be","extrem","traumat","on","that","who","surviv","unfortun","the","film","seem","to","over","glorifi","thi","aspect","and","the","grand","final","be","just","wai","too","champagn","grandstand","oscarhunt","let","creat","a","endur","imag","for","my","likingbr","br","the","problem","i","have","with","stone","and","other","filmmak","of","hi","ilk","be","that","thei","fail","to","understand","thi","simpli","concept","depict","the","terribli","bloodi","deadli","wast","that","war","be","doe","not","prove","or","even","reflect","on","whether","it","be","a","unjust","or","immor","war","we","have","see","the","same","thing","emerg","at","the","moment","with","iraq","in","case","you","re","miss","the","point","let","me","put","it","to","you","bluntli","if","you","see","how","truli","bloodi","the","world","war","be","and","how","destruct","it","be","on","the","live","of","the","surviv","soldier","would","you","think","it","be","a","unjust","war","if","that","fact","alon","doe","not","convinc","you","that","it","be","a","unjust","war","then","why","should","depict","of","the","horror","of","vietnam","convinc","you","that","it","be","wrong","to","go","to","war","in","that","instanc","br","br","person","i","do","not","support","america","decis","to","go","to","war","in","vietnam","but","i","certainli","do","not","subscrib","to","the","thi","war","be","wrong","becaus","peopl","die","and","suffer","theori","i","do","not","think","that","motiv","be","alwai","wrong","by","default","just","becaus","war","in","itself","be","terriblebr","br","thi","sai","noth","of","the","fact","that","the","end","or","the","final","big","twist","be","a","bite","stupid","howev","thi","be","not","stone","oddbal","departur","wall","street","be","a","magnific","film","up","until","the","last","minut","or","so","when","it","make","a","dread","wrong","turn","jfk","be","probabl","on","of","the","few","film","stone","do","that","actual","end","veri","wellbr","br","but","it","hardli","matter","in","thi","on","becaus","there","be","veri","littl","plot","up","until","that","point","of","the","film","to","twist","around","and","thi","be","why","i","give","it","such","a","low","mark","it","be","virtual","storyless","and","ultim","bore","unless","you","fall","for","the","manufactur","poignanc"],"filtered":["read","review","express","view","platoon","never","end","cycl","marin","kill","peopl","kill","take","drug","talk","trashbr","br","agre","becaus","film","actual","much","wai","see","thi","person","try","sai","thi","real","plot","point","agre","withbr","br","selfindulg","stone","hi","well","realli","want","show","onli","war","lead","death","conjur","extrem","traumat","surviv","unfortun","film","seem","glorifi","thi","aspect","grand","final","wai","champagn","grandstand","oscarhunt","let","creat","endur","imag","likingbr","br","problem","stone","filmmak","hi","ilk","thei","fail","understand","thi","simpli","concept","depict","terribli","bloodi","deadli","wast","war","doe","prove","even","reflect","whether","unjust","immor","war","see","thing","emerg","moment","iraq","case","re","miss","point","let","put","bluntli","see","truli","bloodi","world","war","destruct","live","surviv","soldier","think","unjust","war","fact","alon","doe","convinc","unjust","war","depict","horror","vietnam","convinc","wrong","go","war","instanc","br","br","person","support","america","decis","go","war","vietnam","certainli","subscrib","thi","war","wrong","becaus","peopl","die","suffer","theori","think","motiv","alwai","wrong","default","becaus","war","terriblebr","br","thi","sai","noth","fact","end","final","big","twist","bite","stupid","howev","thi","stone","oddbal","departur","wall","street","magnific","film","last","minut","make","dread","wrong","turn","jfk","probabl","film","stone","actual","end","veri","wellbr","br","hardli","matter","thi","becaus","veri","littl","plot","point","film","twist","around","thi","give","low","mark","virtual","storyless","ultim","bore","unless","fall","manufactur","poignanc"],"filtered2":["read","review","express","view","platoon","never","end","cycl","marin","kill","peopl","kill","take","drug","talk","trashbr","agre","becaus","actual","wai","see","person","try","real","plot","point","agre","withbr","selfindulg","stone","well","realli","want","show","onli","war","lead","death","conjur","extrem","traumat","surviv","unfortun","seem","gl

{"value":"Zombie Nation 2004 R<br /><br />Hey, I was bored. I looked in my Comcastic little box to find a movie to watch. Zombie Nation? Hey, I love zombie movies. Says the filmmaker has some sort of cult following in the description. Funny how it doesn't warn me not to watch this film. I could've used that advice.<br /><br />Zombie Nation is just like Troll 2 in that it's completely misnamed. It has little (if anything, depending on your point of view) to do with zombies, and takes place all within one city. This film revolves around a crooked cop, who acts as badly as possible (he has to be trying to suck this much), while he arrests women for trivial bullshit and then kills them. Yup, he's a serial killer cop. Not only is this film flawed in thinking that it's a zombie flick, it also gets its serial killer facts completely wrong. Serial killers enjoy killing, they live for it and they get down and personal with it. This guy knocks out the women, and injects them with some poison. He doesn't even have sex with the corpse or dismember it. Talk about boring! Eventually, one of the whopping five women he kills has Voodoo protection done to her and for no apparent reason, all five come back to life and head off to kill this guy. They were all buried or tossed into the ocean, but you wouldn't know it buy the sharp clean clothes they're all wearing. The women then act very poorly and take their revenge. Oh yay.<br /><br />This film was crap in every category. Crap acting, crap writing, crappier sets, and crappier make-up effects. The women don't look zombie-like, unless you count really dark make-up around the eyes to be the de facto definition of what makes a zombie. They can all talk, behave, think, and act perfectly human. The gore is weak compared to even many PG-13 films and the nudity is beyond brief. You see glimpse of breasts in the opening sequence... Then the exact same breasts later! Go figure. Guess only one actress was willing to go topless for this trite. The police station is so badly constructed that you can see where they stopped painting the walls of the warehouse they're obviously filming in. You can see the pipes and the bad lighting and the overly sparse set-up and even, unless you are blind, you can see the director failing. Steer clear, it's a waste of time.<br /><br

{"value":"There isn't one decent scene.<br /><br />Amy Adams gives one of the worst performances of all time. Proof that you a can start anywhere. The guy playing Sebastian sucks, too. He doesn't even look much like Ryan Phillipe. More like Joshua Jackson. The two other girls are terrible, as well. <br /><br />Then the dialogue is also crap.<br /><br />Sebastian (About to have threesome): If you cant beat them... <br /><br />Virgin Girl: Who says you can't beat 'em?<br /><br />Lame.<br /><br />The ending contradicts the entire plot of the original. In the first film, it is clearly stated that Kathryn and Sebastian never had sex. One of the reasons Sebastian wanted Kathryn so bad, aside from the fact that she's played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, was that she was \"the only girl he couldn't have and it killed him\". She was a tease who liked playing with him. The fact that she never gave it to him increased his wanting. Then in this P.O.S., it implies that he CAN have her, along with a girl on the side. What? And we don't even see the sex, either. It's implied, making it not only stupid, pointless, and contradictory, but worthless too.<br /><br />And in the first one, Kathryn rejects Sebastian because he fell in love, making him a loser. Even though he won the bet, that crumbled his chances. Then in this excrement, he looses AND falls in love. So she doesn't screw \"losers\", only complete losers? Another thing: it's stated that Sebastian has never been in love, so what do you call the thing with Virgin Girl?<br /><br />Then at the end, virgin girl is all of sudden revealed to be Kathryn's evil lesbian lover (dun dun dun) and, like I said, they go into a lame offscreen threesome. Stupid. <br /><br />There's several other plot contradictions. Did the writer even see the first film? A 5 year old can point his stuff out.<br /><br />After the threesome, Sebastian has sex with the blonde virgin, corrupting her innocent mind in the back of a limo while Kathryn and Virgin Girl Turned Evil Lesbian In Lame Sudden Plot Twist sit in the front, listen, and smile evilly into the camera. <br /><br />The end... <br /><br />Seeing Sebastian become the ass hole he was in the first one could have made an interesting film. I guess all it took to make little Sebastian bad was a threesome with two hot girls.

{"value":"This \"film\" is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film. unnecessary slow motion, unnecessary flipping/jumping/somersaults, unnecessary characters, unnecessary dialogue.... basically unnecessity. (is that a word? well, it's just been invented by I, Robot.)<br /><br />What happened to practicality? (i.e. the car garage, the skin spray) the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop.<br /><br />What happened to showing respect for women? (i.e. smith's character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film, and yet she still \"wants\" him. WHERE IS THE TENSION? I'll tell you where, good looks and not admiration or common ground)<br /><br />What happened to a detective that detects? Smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself, complaining to other people, and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off. this is such a lame way to get the story from point b-c-d-etc... it was OK once, but not several times in a row. (speaking of several times in a row, what was the \"I'm snoring and not listening to you joke? Twice In One Scene?)<br /><br />What happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes? Shia LaBeouf (the kid) is in the movie for a total of TWO SCENES, we know that A-he degrades women, and B-he knows Smith....... so of COURSE we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm,<br /><br />What happened to Hero's? let's just forget that there are people, women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that I have an acquaintance with. and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air, showing off, while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot.<br /><br />don't get me wrong, I'm all for spectacle. but I'm also all for a shred of realism and meaning.<br /><br />I have to say I've never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time. so thanks Alex.

{"value":"This is a low-budget spoof of the espionage genre. To help frame your expectations, you should know that: (1) The acting is wildly heavy-handed. The stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement, frequent hand gestures, and off-key pacing. (2) The script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility. Oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements. (3) Shots are frequently framed in off-balance angles, poking fun at genre excesses. (4) A pop-eyed Jeff Goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner.<br /><br />The film has a guiding intelligence, deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the B-films of the 1930's: a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by Carl Sagan. The film's over-the-top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes. In an early running gag, Fay Grim's son Ned is so frequently told to leave that you can't help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad. Parker Posey's nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film.<br /><br />The film's slow pacing does not enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge. The film's impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy. Moreover, it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic. The musical score is intentionally heavy handed, and I found this (and the off-kilter camera angles) more irritating than humorous.<br /><br />The over-the-top acting, the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiracies/counter conspiracies, and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers. The movie is much too long at 158 minutes.<br /><br />That said, fans who are receptive to the film's sarcasm might want to watch again ... using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog. The film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy-handed than light-hearted. But, the comedy may well appeal to your tastes. The film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films, fans of director Hal Harley, or devotees of Parker Posey (who has the most camera time).","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","lowbudget","spoof","of","the","espionag","genr","to","help","frame","your","expect","you","should","know","that","the","act","be","wildli","heavyhand","the","star","be","have","great","fun","deliv","their","line","with","excess","ey","movem","frequent","hand","gestur","and","offkei","pace","the","script","deliber","lack","continu","and","plausibl","oftentim","line","be","abruptli","jar","and","humor","becaus","thei","have","absolut","no","relev","to","previou","plot","elem","shot","be","frequent","frame","in","offbal","angl","poke","fun","at","genr","excess","a","popei","jeff","goldblum","deliv","complex","and","classic","preposter","dialog","in","a","winningli","sarcast","mannerbr","br","the","film","have","a","guid","intellig","deliber","start","with","a","plot","elem","steal","from","the","bfilm","of","the","a","secret","code","with","a","structur","that","would","defi","explan","by","carl","sagan","the","film","overthetop","act","be","us","mostli","for","comic","effect","dure","the","minut","in","a","earli","run","gag","fai","grim","son","ned","be","so","frequent","tell","to","leav","that","you","ca","not","help","chuckl","while","feel","sorri","for","the","lad","parker","posei","nice","choreograph","fall","from","bed","conjur","help","set","a","humor","tone","earli","in","the","filmbr","br","the","film","slow","pace","doe","not","enhanc","the","comedi","elem","or","the","drama","elem","that","late","emerg","the","film","impact","a","drama","be","significantli","lessen","by","the","earli","comedi","moreov","it","be","hard","to","be","overli","involv","with","the","charact","and","their","fate","when","the","earli","portion","of","the","film","be","so","sarcast","the","music","score","be","intention","heavi","hand","and","i","find","thi","and","the","offkilt","camera","angl","much","irrit","than","humorousbr","br","the","overthetop","act","the","implaus","and","nearli","incomprehens","plot","of","conspiraciescount","conspiraci","and","the","slow","pace","will","grind","on","mani","viewer","the","movi","be","much","too","long","at","minutesbr","br","that","sai","fan","who","be","recept","to","the","film","sarcasm","mai","want","to","watch","again","us","close","caption","to","well","catch","the","intellig","ridicul","of","the","dialog","the","film","be","too","slow","for","me","and","the","sarcasm","feel","much","heavyhand","than","lightheart","but","the","comedi","mai","good","appeal","to","your","tast","the","film","be","worth","a","view","for","that","who","enjoi","independ","film","fan","of","director","hal","harlei","or","devote","of","parker","posei","who","have","the","much","camera","time"],"filtered":["thi","lowbudget","spoof","espionag","genr","help","frame","expect","know","act","wildli","heavyhand","star","great","fun","deliv","line","excess","ey","movem","frequent","hand","gestur","offkei","pace","script","deliber","lack","continu","plausibl","oftentim","line","abruptli","jar","humor","becaus","thei","absolut","relev","previou","plot","elem","shot","frequent","frame","offbal","angl","poke","fun","genr","excess","popei","jeff","goldblum","deliv","complex","classic","preposter","dialog","winningli","sarcast","mannerbr","br","film","guid","intellig","deliber","start","plot","elem","steal","bfilm","secret","code","structur","defi","explan","carl","sagan","film","overthetop","act","us","mostli","comic","effect","dure","minut","earli","run","gag","fai","grim","son","ned","frequent","tell","leav","ca","help","chuckl","feel","sorri","lad","parker","posei","nice","choreograph","fall","bed","conjur","help","set","humor","tone","earli","filmbr","br","film","slow","pace","doe","enhanc","comedi","elem","drama","elem","late","emerg","film","impact","drama","significantli","lessen","earli","comedi","moreov","hard","overli","involv","charact","fate","earli","portion","film","sarcast","music","score","intention","heavi","hand","find","thi","offkilt","camera","angl","much","irrit","humorousbr","br","overthetop","act","implaus","nearli","incomprehens","plot","conspiraciescount","conspiraci","slow","pace","grind","mani","viewer","movi","much","long","minutesbr","br","sai","fan","recept","film","sarcasm","mai","want","watch","us","close","caption","well","catch","intellig","ridicul","dialog","film","slow","sarcasm","feel","much","heavyhand","lightheart","comedi","mai","good","appeal","tast","film","worth","view","enjoi","independ","film","fan","director","hal","harlei","devote","parker","posei","much","camera","time"],"filtered2":["lowbudget","spoof","espionag","genr","help","frame","expect","know","act","wildli","heavyhand","star","great","fun","deliv","line","excess","ey","movem","frequent","hand","gestur","offkei","pace","script","deliber","lack","continu","plausibl","oftentim","line","abruptli","jar","humor","becaus","absolut","relev","previou","plot","elem","shot","frequent","frame","offbal","angl","poke","fun","genr","excess","popei","jeff","goldblum","deliv","comple

On the run from Recyclers (bounty hunters who hunt cyborgs), Cash tries to find her way to Cytown, the mythical refuge for cyborgs.<br /><br />\"Cyborg 3: The Recycler\" is the third (& last so far) entry in the CYBORG trilogy. The first film was originally planned to be a sequel to MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE, but was quickly rewritten into a standard post-apocalyptic martial-arts fest that became something of a cult classic due to its cheesy action scenes. CYBORG 2: GLASS SHADOW was a sequel that actually improved upon its predecessor but was not widely seen (& was dismissed by those few who saw it as cheap fodder).<br /><br />This film, for one thing, tries to be a meld of the first two films (the first was a cheesy action film while the second was a smart Cyberpunk story) but unfortunately falls short on both counts. The budget was obviously lower than CYBORG 2, with the film being set in the desert wastelands (like so many post-apocalyptic action films of the 90s were), shot around old industrial buildings to conserve costs.<br /><br />The film's story centres on a plot device, that of a pregnant cyborg, that is as interesting as it is absurd (this film is not the first to try that idea; the anime OVA series ARMITAGE III uses it to a greater extent). But the film falls into the same trap that so many low-budget sci-fi action films fall victim to, in the fact that the snags (synthetic organisms) featured are nothing more than androids. The visual effects amount to nothing more than prosthetic arms & makeup effects.<br /><br />The acting is pretty standard for this kind of film, with the lead actress (Khrystyne Haje) being the single worst performer on display. Instead of being joyed at the news she is pregnant, she acts all whiny & sullen. Her co-stars are much better, Malcolm McDowell being the usual gangster type who enlivens the scenes he appears in & Richard Lynch has a lot of fun as the chief villain. Of particular note is Andrew Byniarski, playing Lynch's right hand man, who would later appear in THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake & its

{"value":"I tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran, so I didn't know who had done it at first. The longer I saw it, the more I started thinking, \"Jesus, this looks like an Albert Pyun flick.\" Wasn't quite sure, though, for two main reasons: the photography was quite good (and the Utah desert scenery was beautiful), and Scott Paulin gave an hilarious performance as Simon, a murderous cyborg, but with some style and a sense of humor. Paulin must have ad-libbed the many clever one-liners he shot out, because Albert Pyun hasn't written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career. Unfortunately, Paulin doesn't have all that much screen time before he's gone, and the movie's the worse for it. Lance Henriksen, playing the evil head cyborg, growls his way through his part, as he's done in countless other movies like this. I don't know what the hell Kris Kristofferson is doing in this thing; maybe he wanted to see what the Utah desert looked like and get paid for it. He goes through the movie looking (and sounding) like he just woke up, and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent. Kathy Long, the nominal hero, has a great body, is attractive, has a great body, fights extremely well, has a great body, and doesn't have an iota of acting talent, but that doesn't matter in a movie like this. This being an Albert Pyun film, it's full of the trademarks that we've all come to know and love: inane and idiotic dialog, choppy editing, and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured, \"Ah, nobody'll ever notice.\"<br /><br />As bad as this movie is, however, it's a shade above most of Pyun's other efforts--this is \"Citizen Kane\" compared to his brain-numbing \"Adrenaline: Feel the Rush\", for example. The fights are pretty well done, if repetitive (after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other, you find yourself saying, \"Alright already, go to something else\"), and Long is very athletic (and, as a previous poster has noted, has a great derrière). It's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as Pyun's usual extravaganzas. You could do worse than rent this movie--not much worse, granted, but worse

{"value":"Its plain to see why the makers of Scary Movie found it so easy to spoof these 'teen slasher' movies. They are so unbelievably formulaic. And if Valentine had been released a year or so earlier, I'm sure they would have been spoofing this film too - that's if they found any actual original material to distinguish it from the Screams, I know what you did last summers, and Urban Legends.<br /><br />Valentine offers nothing new to this genre, except a better than usual ending which, of course, leaves lots of room for the inevitable sequel. As always, a masked psychotic killer stalks a bunch of beautiful young women, killing the main character's friends, one by one, in typically over the top style. Lots of T&A on display, no character development, bad acting, and overly elaborate bloodshed.<br /><br />The thing I can't stand about these kind of movies is that they pass themselves off as 'who done its?'. The thing is that they aren't because the motive is only revealed once the killer has unmasked, and tells the main character who's friends have now all been murdered. Usually something that was never made at all clear during the film anyway (eg. main character's mother's uncle's fishing partner kicked his friend's father's dog). Everybody still left alive throughout the film is a 'suspect', but they are more 'Red Herrings' than suspects. As we all know at this point the main character manages an implausible escape and kills the unmasked psycho killer after the motive is revealed.<br /><br />Valentine followed this formula almost to the letter. ***************SPOILER!!!!!! (mini spoiler anyway)*************** In Valentine the motive was not revealed, but more, left for you to think about given that the film didn't quite conclude in the typical 'teen slash' way. The issue is only part resolved, and the goal of the lead killer may or may not have been fulfilled by surviving the bloodshed and killing almost everybody. Will the killer want more, or were the demons truly vanquished?<br /><br />This still didn't make Valentine a good film, instead it simply saved it from being as bad as usual, which still doesn't count for much. To anybody thinking of making another film along these lines, please don't. Originality is so important, and its hard to see any originality coming out of this

{"value":"I agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film. I found it incredibly silly (at best) and downright misleading, misinforming and harmful (at worst). Like others, I found this film to be an awful mix of \"real\" science and pseudoscientific, New Age propaganda. <br /><br />As a psychologist, I was especially offended by Candace Pert's contributions. True, I was not a fan of hers before this film, but her discourse on the \"consciousness\" of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term (\"consciousness\") that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify. It is an old Orwellian mind-f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay \"Politics and the English Language.\" To refer to \"consciousness\" in this manner--indeed, to refer to this film as \"based in science\" in general (which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by Stalin when he labeled his slave-states \"democratic republics\" and Hitler when he called his party a \"socialist workers\" movement.<br /><br />I don't claim to really understand quantum physics. I know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study. Ah, but we Americans do love \"instant enlightenment,\" and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish. If it ASKED questions, that would be one thing, but it clearly attempts to ask and ANSWER them, which no film could possibly do simply because we are far, far away from the answers (if they indeed exist).<br /><br />By the way, ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several \"expert commentators\" with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi (and TM), not to mention J.Z. Knight, who often speaks in her \"Ramtha\" voice. (I'm always amazed at this channeled 10,000 year-old Atlantean superman's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology. But then again, this film argues that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so if Ramtha existed in Atlantis 10,000 years ago, I suppose he could exist now and tomorrow. Only, then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers? Oh, I forgot, I'm the creator of \"good\" and \"bad\" advice, so it's all my fault, not Ramtha's.)<br /><br />What a mess.","finished_norm":["i","agre","strongli","with","some","of","the","other","critic","of","thi","film","i","find","it","incredibli","silli","at","well","and","downright","mislead","misinform","and","harm","at","wrong","like","other","i","find","thi","film","to","be","a","aw","mix","of","real","scienc","and","pseudoscientif","new","ag","propaganda","br","br","a","a","psychologist","i","be","especi","offend","by","candac","pert","contribut","true","i","be","not","a","fan","of","her","befor","thi","film","but","her","discours","on","the","conscious","of","cell","be","on","of","the","well","exampl","of","take","a","term","conscious","that","have","a","predict","mean","to","much","peopl","and","us","it","in","such","a","distort","manner","a","to","caus","it","to","obscur","rather","than","clarifi","it","be","a","old","orwellian","mindfk","that","the","master","himself","describ","so","good","in","hi","superb","essai","polit","and","the","english","languag","to","refer","to","conscious","in","thi","mannerind","to","refer","to","thi","film","a","base","in","scienc","in","gener","which","be","it","clear","intenti","to","us","languag","in","the","same","manner","emploi","by","stalin","when","he","label","hi","slavest","democrat","republ","and","hitler","when","he","call","hi","parti","a","socialist","worker","movementbr","br","i","do","not","claim","to","realli","understand","quantum","physic","i","know","enough","about","it","to","know","that","to","realli","understand","it","would","take","consider","studi","ah","but","we","american","do","love","instant","enlighten","and","that","what","thi","mistak","of","a","film","try","to","accomplish","if","it","ask","question","that","would","be","on","thing","but","it","clearli","attempt","to","ask","and","answer","them","which","no","film","can","possibli","do","simpli","becaus","we","be","far","far","awai","from","the","answer","if","thei","ind","existbr","br","by","the","wai","ethic","thi","film","ne","a","disclaim","about","the","associ","of","sever","expert","comment","with","the","maharishi","mahesh","yogi","and","tm","not","to","mention","jz","knight","who","often","speak","in","her","ramtha","voic","i","be","alwai","amaz","at","thi","channel","yearold","atlantean","superman","grasp","of","st","centuri","concept","and","terminologi","but","then","again","thi","film","argu","that","the","past","present","and","futur","be","all","on","and","the","same","so","if","ramtha","exist","in","atlanti","year","ago","i","suppos","he","can","exist","now","and","tomorrow","onli","then","how","come","hi","financi","advic","have","be","so","incredibli","bad","for","hi","follow","oh","i","forget","i","be","the","creator","of","good","and","bad","advic","so","it","all","my","fault","not","ramthasbr","br","what","a","mess"],"filtered":["agre","strongli","critic","thi","film","find","incredibli","silli","well","downright","mislead","misinform","harm","wrong","like","find","thi","film","aw","mix","real","scienc","pseudoscientif","new","ag","propaganda","br","br","psychologist","especi","offend","candac","pert","contribut","true","fan","befor","thi","film","discours","conscious","cell","well","exampl","take","term","conscious","predict","mean","much","peopl","us","distort","manner","caus","obscur","rather","clarifi","old","orwellian","mindfk","master","describ","good","hi","superb","essai","polit","english","languag","refer","conscious","thi","mannerind","refer","thi","film","base","scienc","gener","clear","intenti","us","languag","manner","emploi","stalin","label","hi","slavest","democrat","republ","hitler","call","hi","parti","socialist","worker","movementbr","br","claim","realli","understand","quantum","physic","know","enough","know","realli","understand","take","consider","studi","ah","american","love","instant","enlighten","thi","mistak","film","try","accomplish","ask","question","thing","clearli","attempt","ask","answer","film","possibli","simpli","becaus","far","far","awai","answer","thei","ind","existbr","br","wai","ethic","thi","film","ne","disclaim","associ","sever","expert","comment","maharishi","mahesh","yogi","tm","mention","jz","knight","often","speak","ramtha","voic","alwai","amaz","thi","channel","yearold","atlantean","superman","grasp","st","centuri","concept","terminologi","thi","film","argu","past","present","futur","ramtha","exist","atlanti","year","ago","suppos","exist","tomorrow","onli","come","hi","financi","advic","incredibli","bad","hi","follow","oh","forget","creator","good","bad","advic","fault","ramthasbr","br","mess"],"filtered2":["agre","strongli","critic","find","incredibli","silli","well","downright","mislead","misinform","harm","wrong","like","find","aw","mix","real","scienc","pseudoscientif","new","ag","propaganda","psychologist","especi","offend","candac","pert","contribut","true","fan","befor","discours","conscious","cell","well","exampl","take","term","conscious","predict","mean","peopl","us","distort","manner","caus","obscur","rather","clarifi","o

{"value":"This 1973 TV remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original. Surprise!<br /><br />First, the good things. Lee J. Cobb makes a terrific Barton Keyes. He's not as good as Edward G. Robinson, of course, but he's the only reason to watch this. This remake's only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of Lola Dietrichson, the step-daughter of the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson.<br /><br />And that's it for the good things.<br /><br />The bad things are many. The director records everything in an indifferent manner: if you watched the film with the sound muted you'd hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening. Because of modern bad taste, the film must be in color instead of black and white. Because of 1970s bad taste, all the sets are distractingly ugly. Walter Neff's expensive apartment, in particular, is hideous.<br /><br />The modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways. Train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s, so Mr. Dietrichson's decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance. Men stopped wearing hats, which prevents Walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the white-haired Mr. Dietrichson. Women in mourning stopped wearing veils, which robs Samantha Eggar of a prop Barbara Stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene. (Oddly, Lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of them.)<br /><br />Stephen Bochco keeps much of the Billy Wilder-Raymond Chandler script the same. But he makes a lot of tiny, inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular. Outrageously, the famous motorcycle-cop banter is gone, but look closely and you'll see what looks like a post-production cut where those lines should have been. Bochco may not be to blame.<br /><br />Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff. What might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid Phyllis Dietrichson. Instead we get Samantha Eggar, who comes off like a standard-issue villainess from \"Barnaby Jones.\" But who can blame Eggar? With a director who barely seems interested in what's happening in front of the camera, how could Barbara Stanwyck herself have come off

{"value":"A thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims, along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine, and here Susan Lucci performs as a siren, although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one. Isabelle (Lucci), inconstant wife of venture capitalist Stewart Collins (John O'Hurley), begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman Richard Davis (Philip Casnoff), simply a bagatelle for her but an earnest matter of the heart for Richard, apparently mesmerized by his lover while she takes advantage of his ardour by engaging him in a risky plot that will graduate into a scheme of murderous intent. When Davis becomes convinced that guileful Isabelle is a victim of physical abuse administered by her husband, he desperately attempts to free her from what he feels is a marital trap in order that he may wed her himself, coming to believe that the only clear solution to his plight will be found in a rudimentary essay at hiring a professional assassin who will dispose of the allegedly violent Stewart. In the wake of the hit-man's assault upon Collins, a pair of police detectives, performed by Joe Grifasi and Dean McDermott, become increasingly curious concerning Isabelle's possible involvement in the crime, while at the same time reality dawns upon enraptured Richard who might have to pay a dear price in return for his inamorata's maneuvering. Lucci and Kasnoff are properly cast as a viable pair of conspirators, each giving a reading that makes for a boring rather than charming set of lovebirds, but O'Hurley and McDermott offer strong turns in a film that suffers from a hackneyed scenario as well as uninventive direction and design elements. Released upon a Fremantle DVD, this largely lustreless affair depicting a man 'neath the spell of a seductress does benefit from top-flight visual and sound quality, and although no extra features are provided, the above-average production quality enhances able efforts from cinematographer Robert Primes and composer Stephen

{"value":"I bought Unhinged because I got suckered by the gory picture on the cover. If you want to see all the good parts of the movie just look on the back of the box. All the kills are shown and I can honestly tell you that they look much better in the still frames than they do in the movie.<br /><br />Having said that, let's look at the plot. A group of college girls driving to a rock concert (by way of the deep, dark woods in one of the longest driving sequences ever captured on celluloid) slide off the road. No visible damage is done to the car but apparently it was enough to put one of the characters in a comatose state for the rest of the film (or perhaps she read the script and was already in a coma before filming began).<br /><br />The two remaining girls wake up in a big, isolated house. The house, by the way, is fabulous and manages more drama just by its presence than any of the actors in the film. For some reason, though, this house has no roads going to it. The only way you can get to the main road is by hiking five miles through the woods. The girls spend the rest of Unhinged sitting around listening to weird conversations between an old rich bitch (who looks like George Washington in drag) and her equally homely, sexually repressed daughter. The girls apparently were in no hurry to get back from that concert anyway being that they packed more clothes than the cast of Gilligan's Island for that three hour tour.<br /><br />By the time we, the viewers, get to the kill scenes, we no longer care. We wish that someone would kill us just to end our suffering . Unhinged finally wraps up with a quite shocking ending that deserved to be in a much better film. It's almost as though the ending, the one good idea in the film, was written first and then the writers tried to make a movie leading up to it.<br /><br />Unhinged is ultimately a boring film with bad acting, inept directing, and a plot with more holes than a leper in a porno film (sorry. I'm not sure where that came from). You will get an idea of how bad this movie is during the opening credits when, for some reason that is never explained, the screen goes black for about two minutes while the characters talk about nothing worth remembering.

{"value":"This is the first of \"The Complete Dramatic Works of William Shakespeare\" BBC series I've seen, and if all of them are like this, I might watch no more. Being practically the full text of the play is everything this \"Romeo & Juliet\" has going for it, lacking in all other departments. Alvin Rakoff reveals himself as a dreadful director, both in the technical and artistic aspects. In the former, because he commits mistakes that even a first grade film student would wisely avoid. Take in consideration, for example, the badly edited first shot of Abraham and Balthasar in the opening scene, or the Nurse's entering of Friar Lawrence's cell, asking where's Romeo with him being so very in front of her that she'd clearly see him even if she was blind. And, in the latter, because every single one of the performers is misdirected, even if some of them are good actors. Rebecca Saire looks exactly the way I've always imagined Juliet to look like, and she doesn't seem to be a bad actress for a teenager, but her performance totally lacks passion of any kind. Patrick Ryecart as Romeo is even worse, being not only as dull as Juliet, but also way too old and not even good-looking, coming across as a combination of Malcolm McDowell and the Chucky doll. Putting them together makes impossible to think they feel anything for each other, let alone being the main players of the greatest love story ever written. Alan Rickman, in his screen debut, plays Tybalt like if he was Darth Vader, which is a huge mistake that takes away the complexity that Shakespeare intended, no character being a hero or a villain but all flawed human beings. This Tybalt is so mean-looking that we don't believe the characters' pity after his demise. As for Paris, I kept thinking of \"Prince Valium\" from Spaceballs. Only Celia Johnson manages to do the character of the Nurse some justice.<br /><br />At 168 minutes, this production is unable to make us empathize with the characters, because the characters don't empathize with each other and never seen to believe their own roles. The best screen version is still Franco Zeffirelli's. But, to be fair, this BBC one isn't nearly as bad as abominations like George Cukor's flamboyant geriatric version, or the crime against Humanity that is Baz Luhrmann's feature-length MTV video.

Along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor, Jannick(Mark Bazeley), John Sands(Seagal)will fly into enemy territory, receiving help from his Arab lover, Jessica(Ciera Payton)and a freedom fighter, Rojar(Alki David) once they are on ground. Jannick is kidnapped by Black Sunday leaders, Stone(Vincenzo Nicoli)and his female enforcer, Eliana(Katie Jones), and Sands must figure out how to not only re-take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter, but rescue him as well. And, maybe, Sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained, Rather(Steve Toussaint)in the process. Sands has 72 hours until a General's Navy pilots bomb the entire area. On board the stealth, Black Sunday equipped a biochemical bomb, hoping to detonate it on the United States.<br /><br />Seagal gets a chance to shoot Afghans when he isn't slicing their throats with knives. The film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead. The setting of Afghanistan doesn't hold up to scrutiny(..nor does how easily Seagal and co. are able to move about the area undetected so easily) and the plot itself is nothing to write home about. The movie is edited fast, the camera a bit too jerky. Seagal isn't as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes, unlike the good old days. One of Seagal's poorest efforts, and he's as understated as ever(..not a compliment). Even more disappointing is the fact that Seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film's chief villains, tis a shame. He doesn't even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way(..sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around, but it's not as clear a picture as I enjoy because the filmmakers

{"value":"John Boorman's 1998 The General was hailed as a major comeback, though it's hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself. One of three films made that year about famed Northern Irish criminal Martin Cahill (alongside Ordinary Decent Criminal and Vicious Circles), it has an abundance of incident and style (the film was shot in colour but released in b&w Scope in some territories) but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever. With a main character who threatens witnesses, car bombs doctors, causes a hundred people to lose their jobs, tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a ménage a trios with her sister, it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film. It doesn't get it. Instead, it's lumbered with what may well be Brendan Gleeson's worst and most disinterested performance: he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there's nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character. On the plus side, this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug, but it's at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics.<br /><br />There's a minor section that picks up interest when the IRA whips up a local hate campaign against the 'General' and his men, painting them as 'anti-social' drug dealers purely because Cahill won't share his loot from a robbery with them, but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot - something to do with Cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we're expected to find lovably cheeky - that it's just thrown away. Things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart, but by then it's too late to really care. Adrian Dunbar, Maria Doyle Kennedy and the gorgeous Angeline Ball do good work in adoring supporting roles, but Jon Voight's hammy Garda beat cop seems to be there more for American sales than moral balance, overcompensating for Gleeson's comatose non-involvement in what feels like a total misfire. Come back Zardoz, all is

{"value":"It's nothing more than a weird coincidence that I decided to watch STARLIFT on the 59th anniversary of the day in June 1950 when President Truman's ordered US forces into the Korean War. STARLIFT, you see, is set largely at Travis Air Force base in California in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in Korea. But you'd need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name 'Korea' mentioned. We see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there's no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured. Which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute America's men in uniform. Released in December 1951 by Warner Brothers, STARLIFT is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studio's star-studded World War Two home-front morale booster \"Hollywood Canteen.\" This 1944 crowd-pleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in LA hoping to get a date with Joan Leslie. But really it was just an excuse for Warners to trot out every star under contract, from Joan Crawford, John Garfield, and Barbara Stanwyck to Peter Lorre, Bette Davis, Sydney Greenstreet and more. STARLIFT features two Air Force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet Nell Wayne (a mask-like Janice Rule) and persuading a bunch of Warner Bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops. But in place of Crawford, Garfield et al the best the brothers Warner could scrape up in 1951 were Doris Day, Ruth Roman, Gordon MacRae, Virginia Mayo, Gene Nelson and Phil Harris with fleeting appearances by James Cagney, Randolph Scott, and a clearly embarrassed looking Gary Cooper. This threadbare cast, whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp, is perfectly matched by the crummy production values. Presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection. How bad is it? You can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage! To describe STARLIFT as a sloppy, lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy, lazy and third rate. It's just terrible.

{"value":"A reporter, Craig Milford, who works for The James Keller Public Telecommunication Center, has an interview with a German professor of a Floridian university, who made an unknown creature based upon some substance of meteor(s). But then a man named Anderson, who is trying to control the whole planet with the creature, and his man kill the professor and his assistants and plunder the creature. So Craig and his new female psychic partner, Joanna Fitzgerald, who can communicate not only with human being but also with alien friend(s) of the creature, begin to find the creature and try to send it to an alien spaceship... This film has some great casts and staffs. For instance, it has the actor, David Warbeck of THE BEYOND, the actress, Laura Trotter of NIGHTMARE CITY, the special visual effects creator, Sergio Stivaletti of Dario Argento's masterpieces, and the director (and also the story- writer), Alberto De Martino of THE MAN WITH ICY EYES and THE KILLER IS ON THE PHONE. And these talented people make an incredibly bad film, named, nothing but this MIAMI GOLEM which is essentially a confusedly combined film of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND with E.T.THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL. And this not-only-confused-but-also-crammed film has something worth; genetic engineering with psychical research. Consequently the film has at least one scientific and/or technical flaw; genetic engineering and psychical research are never compatible. (Strangely enough, regarding this strangely childish combination of genetic engineering and psychical research, the leading character, Craig, himself says THERE MUST BE A BETTER EXPLANATION to the short-haired psychic, Joanna. But, after all, the whole story of the film doesn't and can't present any kind of BETTER EXPLANATION.) In addition, this film has something more laughable; its problematic music. What the composer, who is credited as Robert Marry, provides is nothing but the strangely insistent BEVERLY-HILLS-COP-tasted music. I don't want to say this Italianised theme of BEVERLY HILLS COP per se is particularly bad music, but I have to say it seems to be manifestly clear the music does not have the fitness for this film per se at all. Indeed just who can think BEVERLY HILLS COP has the compatibility with genetic engineering and/or psychical

{"value":"It's a bad season for Bollywood with all the big releases with a massive hype surrounding proving to be duds at the box office. London Dreams is no exception to that. Let's dissect it... It's all about chasing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve it. Sounds impressive right? But unfortunately the film is not.<br /><br />Arjun (Ajay Devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to make it big someday. His dream is to perform in Wembley stadium in front of a cheering 90,000 audience calling out his name. He is joined by two brothers, Zoheb & Wasim (debutants Aditya Roy & Ranvijay) and a ravishing Priya (Asin). Together they form \"London Dreams\" their dream band. After impressing the chief of a record company, they become overnight sensations. Arjun is secretly in love with Priya which he doesn't want to reveal till he achieves his goal. Arjun then brings his childhood friend Manjit Khosla aka Mannu (Salman Khan), a carefree flirtatious guy who has got no ambitions in life, to join their band. Mannu is a trained musician and a real talent for whom later Arjun become envious for Mannu's superior skills and his affair with Priya. Arjun with the help of Zoheb plans to blight Mannu. What happens next forms the rest of the movies.<br /><br />Coming to the technical aspects, we feel only the shadow of Vipul Amritlal Sha whom we have admired in Namaste London. Felt like he simply visualized the screenplay. To cut it short, a glorified cameraman. Screenplay by Suresh Nair dulls even though it has its moments. Defined in a predictable fashion, the screenplay bore you to stiff. Camera work was awesome in capturing the beauty of London. It's the only entertaining part while watching songs.<br /><br />Few songs are hummable while others are passable noisy fare. Ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character. Salman is monotonous and he irks you. Asin is forgettable and I don't that she will make it big in Bollywood. Aditya Roy is impressive while Ranvijay is strictly OK. Brinda as the bitch is what we have seen in innumerable movies. Ompuri is ongoing with the proceedings. I don't want to pen down about the flaws as it will be a herculean task.<br /><br />Finally let me put it simple and straight, London Dreams is a soulless movie which you may better enjoy on

{"value":"German nut case Jörg Buttgereit apparently has fans - but I don't know why, and I'm Definitely not one of them! The only Buttgereit film I'd seen previously was Nekromantik and I hated every minute of it, but - shockingly - this film is worse! Der Todesking is pointless in the same way as Nekromantik, but it's a worse film because it's boring in a way that few movies have ever managed (it's not far off The Blair Witch Project, seriously). Some people say that this film is 'sick' and 'shocking', but it really isn't. The director may have been making a point about death, but only he knows what it is. How anyone could watch this film and be anything other than bored with it is completely beyond me. The film revolves around the theme of suicide, and follows the deaths of seven different people over the course of a week. Yes, that means we have a pointless and boring episode for Monday, a pointless and boring episode for Tuesday, a pointless and boring episode for Wednesday etc etc. This film manages to be even more boring than my average week! <br /><br />Der Todesking is apparently an 'art' film, although this would appear to be a reference to the way that not very much makes sense rather than a reference to the film bearing any resemblance to 'art'. Each segment of the film is meant to tell a separate story - but it doesn't! We just get a quick little sketch on suicide, and it only makes you wonder what the point is. The film feels like it should be deep, but there's a great big void where the intelligence should be and nothing there to fill it. Buttgereit uses a few evocative images; but I'm unlikely to remember any of them for more than a week or so because this film just isn't that memorable. There's a shot involving a decomposing man's body that features fairly often, but that gets old pretty quick and all you're left with is the rest of the film, which is unfortunate. If I were to struggle for good things to say about this crap, all I can think of is this; the title sounds cool. As I mentioned, Nekromantik is the only other film I've seen from this amateur director; I have copies of Schramm and Nekromantik 2, and now I'm really in no rush to watch either. Der Todesking is a dull film with no point and anyone that calls it 'art' is very much mistaken.

{"value":"My mother worked with Dennis L. Raider for eleven years, not to mention shared an office with him. When it was announced he was BTK, she was shocked. The whole day was just her telling stories about how she never would have seen him as the Wichita Killer. I've heard her re-tell them many times. I've inquired her about a lot of things, and gone to all the interviews that she was asked to go to. I've read the entire book written about Raider, Wichita is my hometown and I was surprised that such a thing could happen in Kansas.<br /><br />There was another BTK movie on TV not too long ago, and I thought this one would have been better at portraying Dennis' killings, maybe even have some intelligent touches to his motives.<br /><br />I'm going to be very blunt with the flaws in this movie. This is based on my mom's portrayal of him, all my readings on him, and the video tapes I've seen of him talking.<br /><br />First of all, the camera angles were horrible. It looked as though it had been shot on a home video camera. The acting was terrible and I couldn't even bear to watch it.<br /><br />Dennis Raider never had long hair. Dennis Raider was a \"very anal man\" and was a \"follow the rule book\" kind of guy. He wasn't as nice as the movie made him look, he was very polite and abrupt, business like. Same goes for his killings, as far as we all know. If you've seen his confession in court, you can already guess.<br /><br />And as for the obsession with the slaughter house? No. Never have I read or has Dennis Raider confessed to having a problem with animal cruelty or people squishing bugs. In fact, he practiced on cats and dogs for choking methods. Yet through-out the whole movie he was putting animals in his victim's faces and acting like he cared about the well-being of them.<br /><br />Dennis Raider never killed the people that he knew, he confessed this, but in the movie in his first killing he tells the lady he knows her also.<br /><br />I really don't even want to go in to this movie, and I'm already ranting. This is NOT what you want to watch if you are interested in the actual happenings of BTK. This is NOT what you want to watch if you want a good horror movie. If you want a badly shot half-porno with some slaughter scenes served the side, then this is your kind of

{"value":"After apprehending the man responsible for the murder of his boss, Deputy Sheriff Thomas Jefferson Geronimo, III, is assigned the task of taking the killer back to Italy. On the way, however, the plane is diverted to Malta. Not long after landing, the killer escapes. Now, and with little help from the Maltese police, Deputy Sheriff Geronimo is out to recapture a murderer. But will his \"shoot first, take names later\" brand of Texas justice work in a foreign country? <br /><br />Let me get this out right up front, I've seen Final Justice both with and without the Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary. I've seen the scenes that were cut that help make the movie a more coherent whole. And I've seen the cut-up TV version that was used for MST3K. Having said that, I've got to admit that I much prefer the MST3K version. Why? Because Final Justice is one lousy movie. The MST3K commentary helps make it much more palatable. On its own, it's a real snoozer of an action movie with corny dialogue (often delivered with such thick Italian accents that it's impossible to understand), bad acting, weak direction, gigantic plot holes, and most everything else you'll find in a bad movie. And if most of Final Justice wasn't \"so bad, it's good\", it would be one terribly dull movie on top of everything else. So, yes, I enjoy the often very funny MST3K commentary over the bad movie on its own.<br /><br />My main sticking points with the MST3K commentary and with most of the reviews I've read on Final Justice, however, involve the criticisms of Joe Don Baker. The main weaknesses in Baker's performance actually have nothing to do with his size or the wardrobe choices of his character or any of the other jokes flung in his direction. Instead, I think much of it is has to do with the poor decision to cast him in the lead in the first place. Joe Don Baker has always struck me as a decent enough actor, but he's not the kind of guy I would call an \"action hero\" by any stretch of the imagination. He's more of a sidekick as he demonstrated with solid performances in a couple of James Bond movies. Or if you really want to blame someone for the problems with Final Justice, point your finger at director Greydon Clark. Clark's resume can't begin to compare with Baker's.

{"value":"The movie remains in the gray for far too long. Very little gets explained as the movie progresses, with as a result lots of weird sequences that seem to have a deeper meaning but because of the way of storytelling they become only just weird and not understandable to watch. It sort of forces you to watch the movie again but no way I'm going to do that. It is that I watched this movie in the morning, I'm sure of it that if I watched this movie in the evening I would had fallen asleep. To me the movie was like a poor man's \"Blade Runner\".<br /><br />The movie leaves far too many questions and improbabilities. It makes the movie leave a pointless and non-lasting impression.<br /><br />Also the weird look of the movie doesn't help much. The movie is halve CGI/halve real life but it's not done halve as good, impressive, spectacular and imaginative as for instance would be the case in later movies such as \"Sin City\" and \"300\". They even created halve of the characters of the movie by computer, which seemed like a very pointless- and odd choice, also considering that the character animation isn't too impressive looking. Sure the futuristic environment is still good looking and the movie obviously wasn't cheap to make but its style over substance and in this case that really isn't a positive thing to say.<br /><br />Some of the lines are also absolutely horrendous and uninteresting. The main God of the movie constantly says lines such as; 'I'm going to do this but it's none of your concern why I want to do it'. Than just don't say anything at all Mr. Horus! It's irritating and a really easy thing to put in movie, if you don't care to explain anything about the plot. Also the deeper questions and meanings of the movie gets muddled in the drivel of the movie and its script.<br /><br />The actors still did their very best. They seemed like they believed in the project and were sure of it that what they were making would be something special. So I can't say anything negative about them.<br /><br />The story and movie is far from original. It rip-offs from a lot of classic and semi-classic, mostly modern, science-fiction movies. It perhaps is also the reason why the movie made a very redundant impression on me.<br /><br />A failed and uninteresting movie experiment.<br /><br

{"value":"*Warning - no plot spoilers ahead, but movie spoilers nonetheless...* My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all-star cast. Wow - very, very wrong. This movie is an overdone, overwrought, and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot! The copyright date on the box said 2005, yet during the very first flashback sequence I was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s, and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s/early 90s dresses and hairdos. It looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film! I tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback, and therefore supposed to look old, but it looked WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s... then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up, and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences (yet it's a different, much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks). I was completely confused until I saw in the special features the short film included - it was all the flashback sequences, shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie! It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up (and indeed acting the co-worker in the 2005 scenes). Thus, this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old, re-cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time. The shell story, shot in 2005, is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead (something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60's to his girl that they would meet on the \"fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium - an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005?) These new scenes and plot might have been OK except the awful, overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie. Don't bother. There's a reason why you've never heard of this movie even though it has a well-known cast - it's

{"value":"The night of the prom: the most important night to any shallow girl composed almost entirely of plastic. And so the characters kept reminding us every ten minutes when some head-peckingly miniscule event occurred in their miniscule lives.<br /><br />There really is no excuse for Prom Night. There is less than nothing original about it and I truly would have given it zero or less stars were it possible on IMDb. The only part of my viewing that I enjoyed was when a group of teenagers sitting in front of us decided to play a game of 'ghosts'. It was a lot more exciting than whatever was going on on the screen in front of them.<br /><br />The plot was basically some guy going on a rampage. And the thing was, it wasn't even a slightly exciting rampage. Maybe if the guy had been remotely frightening rather than a tame Robbie Williams lookalike with a baseball cap, I might have sat there feeling slightly anxious. The fact that I cared less about the characters than I did about the colour of the cinema carpet didn't really add to the effect, either. And to make matters worse, the rest of the characters were equally one-dimensional and oblivious. The hotel staff didn't seem to notice or care that one of their maids had vanished and are further proof that a murderer is unrecognisable after he has had a shave. I was incredibly surprised that the bitchy, stereotypical girl in the blue dress was the only person to notice who he was. She realises this and then proceeds to fall down the stairs, entangle herself in a plastic sheet and then knock over a pile of paint buckets. Nice one.<br /><br />The worst thing was, I hold the belief that that the director was trying his absolute hardest. He really pushed all boundaries by not showing any killing actually happening. Shocking! And the music, don't even get me started. It was almost as appropriate as stripping at a funeral.<br /><br />I really wish that Prom Night was a joke. It was terrible and stupidly predictable. No one, in their right mind or otherwise, has any reason to see this film. Mainstream cinema seems to be going downhill and films like this worsen the situation. If you get the urge to see this absolutely awful film, hear my plea. Don't do it.

{"value":"Quite what the producers of this appalling adaptation were trying to do is impossible to fathom.<br /><br />A group of top quality actors, in the main well cast (with a couple of notable exceptions), who give pretty good performances. Penelope Keith is perfect as Aunt Louise and equally good is Joanna Lumley as Diana. All do well with the scripts they were given.<br /><br />So much for the good. The average would include the sets. Nancherrow is nothing like the house described in the book, although bizarrely the house they use for the Dower House looks remarkably like it. It is clear then that the Dower House is far too big. In the later parts, the writers decided to bring the entire story back to the UK, presumably to save money, although with a little imagination I have no doubt they could have recreated Ceylon.<br /><br />Now to the bad. The screenplay. This is such an appallingly bad adaptation is hard to find words to condemn it. Edward does not die in the battle of Britain but survives, blinded. He makes a brief appearance then commits suicide - why?? Loveday has changed from the young woman totally in love with Gus to a sensible farmer's wife who can give up the love her life with barely a tear (less emotional than Brief Encounter). Gus, a man besotted and passionately in love, is prepared to give up his love without complaint. Walter (Mudge in the book) turns from a shallow unfaithful husband to a devoted family man. Jess is made into a psychologically disturbed young woman who won't speak. Aunt Biddy still has a drink problem but now without any justification. The Dower House is occupied by the army for no obvious reason other than a very short scene with Jess who has a fear of armed soldiers. Whilst Miss Mortimer's breasts are utterly delightful, I could not see how their display on several occasions moved the plot forward. The delightfully named Nettlebed becomes the mundane Dobson. The word limit prevents me from continuing the list.<br /><br />There is a sequel (which I lost all interest in watching after this nonsense) and I wonder if the changes were made to create the follow on story. It is difficult to image that Rosamunde Pilcher would have approved this grotesque perversion of her book; presumably she lost her control when the rights were

{"value":"Please Note: I see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film. I saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky. Considering some indicate that the original version was LONGER and without crappy dubbing, my review must be read with this in mind.<br /><br />Although I know that Rene Clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and Louise Brooks has a bit of a cult following as well, this is in many ways a technically poorly made film. While Hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929, up through the early to almost the mid-30s, a lot of famous French films were essentially silent films--with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film. The lip movements in many, and in particular this film, don't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an American like Ms. Brooks could do a French film. This is just sloppy and I would have preferred they had just made a silent film--and as a silent film this is would have been an average film--with excellent camera work (at times) and some decent silent-style acting.<br /><br />The problem I also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot. For a silent morality play circa 1920, it would have been fine, but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary (that means \"old\"--not \"slutty\"). A lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé can't handle it. She gives it all up, temporarily, but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end! A tad melodramatic, huh? And also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped.<br /><br />Finally, the character of the fiancé's friend(?) I found very disturbing and unreal. He looked like Harold Lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else. As he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about, his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean-spirited. Were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused? This seems to me that's what is implied and I don't like it at all.<br /><br />There are FAR better French films of the era (Le Million, La Femme du Boulanger, Fanny, Regain, and others) as well as better silent films. I just can't understand this film's high

Bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story, but the film already surpasses many in the \"Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks\" genre because it is actually shot in the South.<br /><br />A group of college girls head to Ft. Lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in Georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road. (Note to Yankees: stay on the highway when you go to Florida.) Sue Ellen (Lisa Stahl) has to pee so she heads into the woods. When she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff (Tony March) strangle his mistress (Merry Rozelle) to death. (Note to Yankees: do not wander off into the woods when in the South; not because you might witness a murder, but you may run across a marijuana plantation.) This is the point where the story, not the movie, actually comes close to being good.<br /><br />While Tony March will never have to practice his Oscar speech, his Sheriff Dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do. Tom Law is likable as Deputy Scott and is as authentic a Southern deputy as I've seen since Walton Goggins (Deputy Steve Naish) in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.<br /><br />A few scenes in the movie are worth the mention. The girls stop at a BBQ in South Carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out. Sue Ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her.<br /><br />And in the strangest scene, Sheriff Dean makes like he's about to rape Patty (Carol Cadby) and tells her to take off her clothes. Dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he's about to do. The preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his Bible. His sermon is about how Jezebel is saved by the blood of Jesus Christ. I feel sorry for this preacher's flock. Jezebel was in the Old Testament a few thousand years before Christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in

{"value":"I bought this movie for $5 at a used CD store, and I kinda regret it. I'll start by saying I'm a huge fan of cheesy horror flicks. They provide a horribly tacky cheap entertainment. This movie entertained for the first half hour, because it was so bad it could be made fun of in an MST3K style manner quite easily. Then it got boring.<br /><br />The acting is the scariest part of the movie. While great acting is not to be expected, this was laughably bad and, honestly, provided all of the entertainment that was to be had. This is the plus side to the movie. Where the movie really falters in entertaining is the writing, lighting, and the editing.<br /><br />This movie provides way too many \"What the %$@# is going on?\" moments. There are many moments, such as the mother having strange fits at dinner, and then that having absolutely no consequence in the movie. Along the lines of dinner, someone in charge decided it was fun to watch people eat refined food for five minutes straight without dialogue every time a meal was served. During the meals and other inappropriate moments, the scene cuts away to pure darkness outside. Then cuts back in. And speaking of darkness outside, one of the funniest parts of the movie is the climate, where apparently it isn't nighttime unless it's raining. And speaking of darkness, a big problem with the movie is that it's so poorly lit you can't see what's going on half the time, which is more of a frustration than anything. In one of the climactic scenes, you can't even tell what you're supposed to be seeing that's so shocking.<br /><br />And when it comes to climactic scenes, Unhinged contains one of the worst. I've seen people say \"Wow, that surprised me, and that's good.\" I can say that the big reveal did surprise me, because I didn't see it coming. The reason I didn't see it coming is because it made absolutely no sense. I won't ruin it for you, but I will tell you that my friend and I spent a good twenty minutes rewinding to various parts of the movie to find anything that would have validated that at all, and all we found were more things saying that it wasn't possible.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is actually better when you watch it with the commentary tracks that make fun of it. I love crap horror movies, but this was too much.","finished_norm":["i","bui","thi","movi","for","at","a","us","cd","store","and","i","kinda","regret","it","i","will","start","by","sai","i","be","a","huge","fan","of","cheesi","horror","flick","thei","provid","a","horribli","tacki","cheap","entertain","thi","movi","entertain","for","the","half","hour","becaus","it","be","so","bad","it","can","be","make","fun","of","in","a","mstk","styl","manner","quit","easili","then","it","get","boringbr","br","the","act","be","the","scari","part","of","the","movi","while","great","act","be","not","to","be","expect","thi","be","laughabl","bad","and","honestli","provid","all","of","the","entertain","that","be","to","be","have","thi","be","the","plu","side","to","the","movi","where","the","movi","realli","falter","in","entertain","be","the","write","light","and","the","editingbr","br","thi","movi","provid","wai","too","mani","what","the","be","go","on","moment","there","be","mani","moment","such","a","the","mother","have","strang","fit","at","dinner","and","then","that","have","absolut","no","consequ","in","the","movi","along","the","line","of","dinner","someon","in","charg","decid","it","be","fun","to","watch","peopl","eat","refin","food","for","five","minut","straight","without","dialogu","everi","time","a","meal","be","serv","dure","the","meal","and","other","inappropri","moment","the","scene","cut","awai","to","pure","dark","outsid","then","cut","back","in","and","speak","of","dark","outsid","on","of","the","funni","part","of","the","movi","be","the","climat","where","appar","it","be","not","nighttim","unless","it","rain","and","speak","of","dark","a","big","problem","with","the","movi","be","that","it","so","poorli","light","you","ca","not","see","what","go","on","half","the","time","which","be","much","of","a","frustrat","than","anyth","in","on","of","the","climact","scene","you","ca","not","even","tell","what","you","re","suppos","to","be","see","that","so","shockingbr","br","and","when","it","come","to","climact","scene","unhing","contain","on","of","the","wrong","i","have","see","peopl","sai","wow","that","surpris","me","and","that","good","i","can","sai","that","the","big","reveal","do","surpris","me","becaus","i","do","not","see","it","come","the","reason","i","do","not","see","it","come","be","becaus","it","make","absolut","no","sens","i","wo","not","ruin","it","for","you","but","i","will","tell","you","that","my","friend","and","i","spend","a","good","twenti","minut","rewind","to","variou","part","of","the","movi","to","find","anyth","that","would","have","valid","that","at","all","and","all","we","find","be","much","thing","sai","that","it","be","not","possiblebr","br","all","in","all","thi","movi","be","actual","well","when","you","watch","it","with","the","commentari","track","that","make","fun","of","it","i","love","crap","horror","movi","but","thi","be","too","much"],"filtered":["bui","thi","movi","us","cd","store","kinda","regret","start","sai","huge","fan","cheesi","horror","flick","thei","provid","horribli","tacki","cheap","entertain","thi","movi","entertain","half","hour","becaus","bad","make","fun","mstk","styl","manner","quit","easili","get","boringbr","br","act","scari","part","movi","great","act","expect","thi","laughabl","bad","honestli","provid","entertain","thi","plu","side","movi","movi","realli","falter","entertain","write","light","editingbr","br","thi","movi","provid","wai","mani","go","moment","mani","moment","mother","strang","fit","dinner","absolut","consequ","movi","along","line","dinner","someon","charg","decid","fun","watch","peopl","eat","refin","food","five","minut","straight","without","dialogu","everi","time","meal","serv","dure","meal","inappropri","moment","scene","cut","awai","pure","dark","outsid","cut","back","speak","dark","outsid","funni","part","movi","climat","appar","nighttim","unless","rain","speak","dark","big","problem","movi","poorli","light","ca","see","go","half","time","much","frustrat","anyth","climact","scene","ca","even","tell","re","suppos","see","shockingbr","br","come","climact","scene","unhing","contain","wrong","see","peopl","sai","wow","surpris","good","sai","big","reveal","surpris","becaus","see","come","reason","see","come","becaus","make","absolut","sens","wo","ruin","tell","friend","spend","good","twenti","minut","rewind","variou","part","movi","find","anyth","valid","find","much","thing","sai","possiblebr","br","thi","movi","actual","well","watch","commentari","track","make","fun","love","crap","horror","movi","thi","much"],"filtered2":["bui","us","cd","store","kinda","regret","start","huge","fan","cheesi","horror","flick","provid","horribli","tacki","cheap","entertain","entertain","half","hour","becaus","bad","make","fun","mstk","styl","manner","quit","easili","get","boringbr","act","scari","part","great","act","expect","laughabl","bad","honestli","provid","entertain","plu","side","realli","falter","entertain","write","light","editingbr","provid","wai","mani","go","moment","mani","moment","mothe

{"value":"This could well be the worst film I've ever seen. Despite what Mikshelt claims, this movie isn't even close to being historically accurate. It starts badly and then it's all downhill from there. We have Hitler's father cursing his own bad luck on the \"fact\" that he'd married his niece! They were in fact, second cousins. Hitler's mother, Klara, called his father, Alois, \"uncle\" because Alois had been adopted and raised by Klara's grandfather and brought up as his son, when he was really his nephew. Alois was much older than Klara and so as a child she'd got into the habit of calling Alois, \"uncle.\"<br /><br />The scene in the trenches where Hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers. We see Hitler chase the dog through the trench, when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him. In the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man, but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors, and every last one, we are told, is killed outright. How then, if Hitler was the only person to survive the scene, did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told? Did Hitler himself go around \"boasting\" about it? - I don't think so.<br /><br />Next up, Hitler bullies and intimidates a poor, stressed out and war weary Jewish officer into giving him an Iron Cross! I can only assume that this Jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the Fatherland, and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop, because I'm certain that Iron Crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farce.<br /><br />All the grotesque clichés are here, not least the calming and hypnotic effect of Wagner's music upon the little man. If only the producers had kept Ian Kershaw on side.

{"value":"\"The Running Jumping & Standing Still Film\" is not a film as such, but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme. This 'film' got Richard Lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first Beatles film: 'A Hard Day's Night\".<br /><br />Richard Lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959. This film was entitled The Running, Jumping, & Standing Still Film. It was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production. Since the film was intended to be viewed by Lester and his partners alone, a small amount of money and time was invested. The sole purpose of this film is entertainment, but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera. The film cost 70£ to make, and it was filmed in sepia-toned film stock in a field on a couple of Sundays. All of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production; the finished production is eleven minutes in length.<br /><br />The Running, Jumping, & Standing Still Film is a comedy about English Sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time. All of the events in this film take place in a field. A few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn, a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record, a photographer developing film in a pond, an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model's face, a man building a tent, an athlete running over the tent, and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun. Not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away, but it also pokes fun at English culture when compared to American culture. Another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite, which has been constructed out of the flag of the United Kingdom. One of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it, and the kite breaks. According to Neil Sinyard, author of The Films of Richard Lester, this event symbolizes the United Kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the United States during the space age. According to this scene, the British fly primitive kites while the Americans, the world-power after World War II, fly highly-advanced rockets and space shuttles.","finished_norm":["the","run","jump","stand","still","film","be","not","a","film","a","such","but","it","be","a","short","seri","of","clip","with","a","comic","slapstick","theme","thi","film","get","richard","lester","recognis","and","pave","the","wai","for","him","to","direct","the","beatl","film","a","hard","dai","nightbr","br","richard","lester","direct","and","write","the","music","for","hi","film","in","thi","film","be","entitl","the","run","jump","stand","still","film","it","be","intend","to","be","view","onli","by","that","who","have","aid","in","it","product","sinc","the","film","be","intend","to","be","view","by","lester","and","hi","partner","alon","a","small","amount","of","monei","and","time","be","invest","the","sole","purpos","of","thi","film","be","entertain","but","the","main","reason","for","it","exist","be","the","fact","that","it","serv","a","a","experi","to","work","the","camera","the","film","cost","to","make","and","it","be","film","in","sepiaton","film","stock","in","a","field","on","a","coupl","of","sundai","all","of","the","shot","that","be","film","be","includ","in","the","finish","product","the","finish","product","be","eleven","minut","in","lengthbr","br","the","run","jump","stand","still","film","be","a","comedi","about","english","sundai","and","the","small","hobbi","that","peopl","do","to","pass","the","time","all","of","the","event","in","thi","film","take","place","in","a","field","a","few","of","thi","comic","event","includ","a","woman","scrub","a","lawn","a","man","run","around","a","tree","stump","with","a","needl","to","plai","a","record","a","photograph","develop","film","in","a","pond","a","artist","aid","in","paint","by","the","number","on","a","model","face","a","man","build","a","tent","a","athlet","run","over","the","tent","and","a","duel","between","a","man","with","a","knife","and","a","man","with","a","gun","not","onli","doe","the","film","poke","fun","at","the","hobbi","that","peopl","do","to","pass","the","time","awai","but","it","conjur","poke","fun","at","english","cultur","when","compar","to","american","cultur","anoth","on","of","sever","event","in","thi","film","includ","a","group","of","man","and","a","kite","which","have","be","construct","out","of","the","flag","of","the","unit","kingdom","on","of","the","man","jump","insid","the","kite","while","the","other","man","attempt","to","fly","it","and","the","kite","break","accord","to","neil","sinyard","author","of","the","film","of","richard","lester","thi","event","symbol","the","unit","kingdom","a","lesser","in","power","and","technologi","when","compar","to","the","unit","state","dure","the","space","ag","accord","to","thi","scene","the","british","fly","primit","kite","while","the","american","the","worldpow","after","world","war","ii","fly","highlyadvanc","rocket","and","space","shuttl"],"filtered":["run","jump","stand","still","film","film","short","seri","clip","comic","slapstick","theme","thi","film","get","richard","lester","recognis","pave","wai","direct","beatl","film","hard","dai","nightbr","br","richard","lester","direct","write","music","hi","film","thi","film","entitl","run","jump","stand","still","film","intend","view","onli","aid","product","sinc","film","intend","view","lester","hi","partner","alon","small","amount","monei","time","invest","sole","purpos","thi","film","entertain","main","reason","exist","fact","serv","experi","work","camera","film","cost","make","film","sepiaton","film","stock","field","coupl","sundai","shot","film","includ","finish","product","finish","product","eleven","minut","lengthbr","br","run","jump","stand","still","film","comedi","english","sundai","small","hobbi","peopl","pass","time","event","thi","film","take","place","field","thi","comic","event","includ","woman","scrub","lawn","man","run","around","tree","stump","needl","plai","record","photograph","develop","film","pond","artist","aid","paint","number","model","face","man","build","tent","athlet","run","tent","duel","man","knife","man","gun","onli","doe","film","poke","fun","hobbi","peopl","pass","time","awai","conjur","poke","fun","english","cultur","compar","american","cultur","anoth","sever","event","thi","film","includ","group","man","kite","construct","flag","unit","kingdom","man","jump","insid","kite","man","attempt","fly","kite","break","accord","neil","sinyard","author","film","richard","lester","thi","event","symbol","unit","kingdom","lesser","power","technologi","compar","unit","state","dure","space","ag","accord","thi","scene","british","fly","primit","kite","american","worldpow","world","war","ii","fly","highlyadvanc","rocket","space","shuttl"],"filtered2":["run","jump","stand","still","short","clip","comic","slapstick","theme","get","richard","lester","recognis","pave","wai","direct","beatl","hard","dai","nightbr","richard","lester","direct","write","music","entitl","run","jump","stand","still","intend","view","onli","aid","product","sinc","intend","view","lester","partner","alon","sm
