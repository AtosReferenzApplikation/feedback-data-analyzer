{"value":"Wow, I just finally managed, after several attempts, to finish watching this god awful movie, only to learn that Rick Sloane and his production team have completed a straight-to-video sequel this year.<br /><br />Of all movies reviewed by MST3K--and they truly dig from the bottom of the barrel, screening the reputationally bad 'Manos,' 'Werewolf,' 'The Incredibly Strange,' and the lesser know disasters like 'Laserblast,' 'Zombie Nightmare,' and 'Time Chasers,'--this certainly has to be the absolute biggest pile of garbage they'd ever shown (which makes it perfect for riffing). Very simple, the movie is about a bunch of Munchies-like gremlins on the loose, exploiting people's desires for fame, fortune, prowess, and of course, sex in ways that end up with people getting killed. But this is the kind of movie where the acting is so ridiculous (a test of machismo, for example, is illustrated by two guys who battle in the front yard with garden tools), the writing is so forced (such as the oft-described scene of a gremlin hanging on the arm of one girl who would notice it, if only she turned her head a quarter to the left... and this isn't the first time in the movie this happens), and the story is so... rarely given attention (hence the MST3K riff about a \"law in the future where films have to be made by FILMmakers), that you actually root for the furry puppets to kill off everyone on screen. Worst movie... ever.","finished_norm":["wow","i","just","final","manag","after","sever","attempt","to","finish","watch","thi","god","aw","movi","onli","to","learn","that","rick","sloan","and","hi","product","team","have","complet","a","straighttovideo","sequel","thi","yearbr","br","of","all","movi","review","by","mstkand","thei","truli","dig","from","the","bottom","of","the","barrel","screen","the","reputation","bad","mano","werewolf","the","incredibli","strang","and","the","lesser","know","disast","like","laserblast","zombi","nightmar","and","time","chasersthi","certainli","have","to","be","the","absolut","big","pile","of","garbag","thei","have","ever","show","which","make","it","perfect","for","riff","veri","simpl","the","movi","be","about","a","bunch","of","munchieslik","gremlin","on","the","loos","exploit","peopl","desir","for","fame","fortun","prowess","and","of","cours","sex","in","wai","that","end","up","with","peopl","get","kill","but","thi","be","the","kind","of","movi","where","the","act","be","so","ridicul","a","test","of","machismo","for","exampl","be","illustr","by","two","gui","who","battl","in","the","front","yard","with","garden","tool","the","write","be","so","forc","such","a","the","oftdescrib","scene","of","a","gremlin","hang","on","the","arm","of","on","girl","who","would","notic","it","if","onli","she","turn","her","head","a","quarter","to","the","leav","and","thi","be","not","the","time","in","the","movi","thi","happen","and","the","stori","be","so","rare","give","attent","henc","the","mstk","riff","about","a","law","in","the","futur","where","film","have","to","be","make","by","filmmak","that","you","actual","root","for","the","furri","puppet","to","kill","off","everyon","on","screen","wrong","movi","ever"],"filtered":["wow","final","manag","sever","attempt","finish","watch","thi","god","aw","movi","onli","learn","rick","sloan","hi","product","team","complet","straighttovideo","sequel","thi","yearbr","br","movi","review","mstkand","thei","truli","dig","bottom","barrel","screen","reputation","bad","mano","werewolf","incredibli","strang","lesser","know","disast","like","laserblast","zombi","nightmar","time","chasersthi","certainli","absolut","big","pile","garbag","thei","ever","show","make","perfect","riff","veri","simpl","movi","bunch","munchieslik","gremlin","loos","exploit","peopl","desir","fame","fortun","prowess","cours","sex","wai","end","peopl","get","kill","thi","kind","movi","act","ridicul","test","machismo","exampl","illustr","two","gui","battl","front","yard","garden","tool","write","forc","oftdescrib","scene","gremlin","hang","arm","girl","notic","onli","turn","head","quarter","leav","thi","time","movi","thi","happen","stori","rare","give","attent","henc","mstk","riff","law","futur","film","make","filmmak","actual","root","furri","puppet","kill","everyon","screen","wrong","movi","ever"],"filtered2":["wow","final","manag","sever","attempt","finish","watch","god","aw","onli","learn","rick","sloan","product","team","complet","straighttovideo","sequel","yearbr","review","mstkand","truli","dig","bottom","barrel","screen","reputation","bad","mano","werewolf","incredibli","strang","lesser","know","disast","like","laserblast","zombi","nightmar","time","chasersthi","certainli","absolut","big","pile","garbag","ever","show","make","perfect","riff","veri","simpl","bunch","munchieslik","gremlin","loos","exploit","peopl","desir","fame","fortun","prowess","cours","sex","wai","end","peopl","get","kill","kind","act","ridicul","test","machismo","exampl","illustr","two","gui","battl","front","yard","garden","tool","write","forc","oftdescrib","scene","gremlin","hang","arm","girl","notic","onli","turn","head","quarter","leav","time","happen","stori","rare","give","attent","henc","mstk","riff","law","futur","make","filmmak","actual","root","furri","puppet","kill","everyon","screen","wrong","ever"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,8,9,11,15,17,19,21,23,24,25,26,28,30,33,44,47,52,55,65,74,76,82,84,94,96,103,122,138,156,176,177,190,192,199,208,222,246,254,268,274,307,316,323,338,342,345,352,387,389,417,419,431,573,636,677,687,688,702,723,736,773,786,844,848,860,918,940,962,992,1003,1013,1029,1034,1054,1133,1182,1306,1363,1465,1548,1799,1972,2262,2277,2337,2563,2686,2724,2816,2893,3173,3320,4442,4626,4998,5780,6691,7571,7615],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,7,8,9,11,15,17,19,21,23,24,25,26,28,30,33,44,47,52,55,65,74,76,82,84,94,96,103,122,138,156,176,177,190,192,199,208,222,246,254,268,274,307,316,323,338,342,345,352,387,389,417,419,431,573,636,677,687,688,702

{"value":"I was curious to watch this movie. A lot of people seem to be excited. I also have my beliefs. I believe in Jesus Christ but I'm opened for any kind of views or opinions. It doesn't matter for me, if Jesus existed in the way it's written in the bible. If Maria was a virgin or not, or all the other similar pagan coincidences. What matters for me is the idea of salvation, the idea of love as the only way to find peace in this world.<br /><br />What made me angry is when somebody takes a sentence, present it as a fact but without showing the context it was written. For example, they showed in this movie following sentence big: \"Those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them - bring them here and kill them in front of me\" Jesus (Lukas 19:27) What they didn't tell you is the context. Jesus told a story about an evil king. There is no passage in the bible where Jesus supports killing. He is love! After quoting the bible wrong they present us yelling people (pseudo-christians) filled with hate. The majority of viewers don't check the informations presented so they start thinking Jesus=hate=not good for me or for anybody else. This is pure manipulation people. Please use your brain. Don't take everything as a fact they tell you in this movie. We destroy our own basis, our civilization if we start dismantling Jesus in this way and the message he brought to us.

{"value":"(First of all, excuse my bad English) Of course only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious goofs like this.. I'm a norwegian and I felt offended and shocked the makers of this movie did not take the time to do their research upon making this American/\"Norwegian\" movie. Even Wikipedia is more accurate when it comes to facts about this country.<br /><br />So I'm posting my corrections out of my frustration: -The Country is named Norway, not Norwegia. -\"Da\" is Russian, not norwegian. -Norwegian priests never use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far -It's true we have a native traditional folk-outfit (that we only use like twice a year) but the outfit in this movie is more like a German outfit. -I could NOT understand the so called \"norwegian\" in this movie.. Jessica was not making any sense.. neighter did the \"norwegian priests\"<br /><br />The only thing I recognise is the norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but that's so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings!:O gosh)<br /><br />Well.. I guess the people who made this film will never read this comment. but at least I cleared some things up and got rid of some of that frustration..!<br /><br />I'm proud of my country and I'd love if people in the US were less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country.<br /><br />That was all..

{"value":"The Thumb idea isn't such a winner the second time round. ThumbTanic wasn't as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. Primarily, I think, Mr Oedekerk had far less to work with in the Titanic send-up. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic hasn't (yet?) become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience.<br /><br />In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled by one-off jokes which don't really seem related to anything. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine isn't clean during the \"jump off end of ship\" scene - it's not funny. Rather, you just think to yourself, \"Did I miss something in the original movie?\". There were too many of these type of baseless jokes (cf. arachnid).<br /><br />By contrast, the send-up of the smarmy ship's designer had meaning and was funny. Also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go \"faster\" as a maniac running around demanding *everything* be \"faster\" including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. These sort of jokes meant something in the Titanic context and lent meaningful humour to Thumbtanic.<br /><br />The thumb \"media\", the faces and the voices, are still amusing. The props and sets and the CG animation are worthy of appreciation. Overall, although ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness alone won't work, this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the

{"value":"There is only one thing essential to thorough appreciation of The Indian Runner. Unzip your trousers. Peek inside. Is there evidence of a Y chromosome? Okay, you'll do.<br /><br />This film has all the male requisites: blood, guns, car chases, fond women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, liquor, violence, pyrotechnics -- what have I left out? -- oh, yeah, blowtorches.<br /><br />As a woman, I seriously hope Sean Penn regards this as a `when I was a child...' kind of effort. Since he both wrote and directed the thing, he's nearly solely responsible. An uneven cast (Viggo Mortensen as usual demonstrating brilliantly how the job's supposed to be done) tries to save Penn. Too late. The lines and action are there. Even devoted, skilled acting can't change those.<br /><br />I found this movie puerile and silly, as well as predictable. The dialogue staggers along -- Sandy Dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a woodenly maternal monologue without motherly authenticity. Then she dies. After a bit, so does the protagonists' father, played by Charles Bronson. Their absence is hardly noticeable.<br /><br />At intervals, the pyrotechnics, etc., noted above appear to liven things up and scare the audience into thinking something significant is occurring.<br /><br />If you're male and under 25, you may adore this film.

{"value":"This is just horrible, really horrible trash. Yes, we've got beautiful naked women dancing and having sex. But while this may work in the mechanism of a porn movie  may have even been a hit as a porn movie  this tries to mask itself as a \"film\" with actual things to say, with real emotion and struggle. It isn't. It's an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time. I'm sure all of these women (and men) in this particular movie could have faired decently in the porn movie business of the 1970s . . . but not in the actual movie business.<br /><br />The acting was hackneyed, so bad, I mean real terrible. The writing was even worse. I can't lay all blame on these actors  they had nothing to work with. The very broad structure or plot of the movie could possibly be done and done well with good writers and competent actors. The very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar, as a sniper. These shootings were motivated from men not respecting their women enough. If there was more writing - better writing, much better writing - and less gratuitous sexual imagery we might have something to work with.<br /><br />This movie should have been shot, made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all along; it would have made more money. It practically is a hardcore porn film already, and it remains the only non-porn movie I've seen that shows a male erect penis.","finished_norm":["thi","be","just","horribl","realli","horribl","trash","ye","we","have","get","beauti","nake","woman","danc","and","have","sex","but","while","thi","mai","work","in","the","mechan","of","a","porn","movi","mai","have","even","be","a","hit","a","a","porn","movi","thi","try","to","mask","itself","a","a","film","with","actual","thing","to","sai","with","real","emot","and","struggl","it","be","not","it","a","excus","to","get","some","girl","nake","and","have","a","fun","time","i","be","sure","all","of","thi","woman","and","man","in","thi","particular","movi","can","have","fair","decent","in","the","porn","movi","busi","of","the","but","not","in","the","actual","movi","businessbr","br","the","act","be","hacknei","so","bad","i","mean","real","terribl","the","write","be","even","wrong","i","ca","not","lie","all","blame","on","thi","actor","thei","have","noth","to","work","with","the","veri","broad","structur","or","plot","of","the","movi","can","possibli","be","do","and","do","good","with","good","writer","and","compet","actor","the","veri","broad","structur","or","plot","be","that","of","a","psychot","man","who","spend","hi","time","shoot","peopl","from","afar","a","a","sniper","thi","shoot","be","motiv","from","man","not","respect","their","woman","enough","if","there","be","much","write","well","write","much","well","write","and","littl","gratuit","sexual","imageri","we","mai","have","someth","to","work","withbr","br","thi","movi","should","have","be","shoot","make","and","market","a","hardcor","porn","movi","all","along","it","would","have","make","much","monei","it","practic","be","a","hardcor","porn","film","alreadi","and","it","remain","the","onli","nonporn","movi","i","have","see","that","show","a","male","erect","peni"],"filtered":["thi","horribl","realli","horribl","trash","ye","get","beauti","nake","woman","danc","sex","thi","mai","work","mechan","porn","movi","mai","even","hit","porn","movi","thi","try","mask","film","actual","thing","sai","real","emot","struggl","excus","get","girl","nake","fun","time","sure","thi","woman","man","thi","particular","movi","fair","decent","porn","movi","busi","actual","movi","businessbr","br","act","hacknei","bad","mean","real","terribl","write","even","wrong","ca","lie","blame","thi","actor","thei","noth","work","veri","broad","structur","plot","movi","possibli","good","good","writer","compet","actor","veri","broad","structur","plot","psychot","man","spend","hi","time","shoot","peopl","afar","sniper","thi","shoot","motiv","man","respect","woman","enough","much","write","well","write","much","well","write","littl","gratuit","sexual","imageri","mai","someth","work","withbr","br","thi","movi","shoot","make","market","hardcor","porn","movi","along","make","much","monei","practic","hardcor","porn","film","alreadi","remain","onli","nonporn","movi","see","show","male","erect","peni"],"filtered2":["horribl","realli","horribl","trash","ye","get","beauti","nake","woman","danc","sex","mai","work","mechan","porn","mai","even","hit","porn","try","mask","actual","thing","real","emot","struggl","excus","get","girl","nake","fun","time","sure","woman","man","particular","fair","decent","porn","busi","actual","businessbr","act","hacknei","bad","mean","real","terribl","write","even","wrong","ca","lie","blame","actor","noth","work","veri","broad","structur","plot","possibli","good","good","writer","compet","actor","veri","broad","structur","plot","psychot","man","spend","time","shoot","peopl","afar","sniper","shoot","motiv","man","respect","woman","enough","write","well","write","well","write","littl","gratuit","sexual","imageri","mai","someth","work","withbr","shoot","make","market","hardcor","porn","along","make","monei","practic","hardcor","porn","alreadi","remain","onli","nonporn","see","show","male","erect","peni"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,8,9,11,13,14,15,20,21,23,25,28,29,32,36,41,45,46,48,49,52,53,65,70,80,81,84,88,93,117,119,126,166,209,230,254,259,283,287,309,324,325,330,388,492,506,519,558,617,649,650,671,682,694,790,832,842,877,893,898,902,917,971,1243,1321,1340,1361,1614,2370,2569,2576,2578,2614,2844,3247,4636,4670,7149,8586],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,8,9,11,13,14,15,20,21,23,25,28,29,32,36,41,45,46,48,49,52,53,65,70,80,81,84,88,93,117,119,126,166,209,230,254,259,283,287,309,324,325,330,388,492,506,519,558,617,649,650,671,682,694,790,832,842,877,893,898,902,917,971,1243,1321,1340,1361,1614,2370,2569,2576,2578,2614,2844,3247,4636,4670,7149,8586],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,1.852034211452262,1.883787371

{"value":"Want a great recipe for failure? Take a s****y plot, add in some weak, completely undeveloped characters and than throw in the worst special effects a horror movie has known. Let stew for a week (the amount of time probably spent making this trash). The result is Corpse Grinders, a movie that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotically low places.<br /><br />The movie utterly blew. My words cannot convey how painful it was to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit around and make fun of. This is not Plan 9 From Outer Space. This is a long, boring, sad waste of time. Corpse Grinders II is the biggest waste of energy and talent I have ever seen. I depresses me when I realize that people actually took time out of their lives to act in this shit, if you can call it acting. But than again, when you have poor direction, poor storywriting, poor everything, acting is the last thing to criticize.<br /><br />This movie is like a huge, disgusting turd that you yearn to quickly flush out of existence, fearful that a friend or loved one might somehow see it. I really with I could somehow destroy every copy of this film, so it will not pollute the minds of aspiring filmmakers. Thank you, Ted V. Mikels, for giving me new found respect for every movie I have ever seen. You have shown me what is truly awful, and why I should appreciate all those movies that are merely crappy or

{"value":"Who likes awful \"comedy\" shows like Little Mosque on the Prairie? The only two kinds of people I can think of who watch this are: One, Muslims and self-proclaimed Liberal defenders of every ethnic group who are so thrilled there is a show about Muslims that it doesn't even matter if the show is good or funny at all (which it is not). Two, old people and people whose idea of comedy is incredibly predictable, badly written, stale jokes.<br /><br />CBC needs to really take a look at what they are doing and who their audience is. If they keep only writing comedy for really old people then guess what will happen, their audience will die off soon and they will have no audience left. I'd be curious who even writes for this show? Do you think it's actually Muslims, or hip, funny young people? No, I bet it is old white guys who have been writing the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960's.<br /><br />When you look at the CBC comedy shows there are, Air Farce was only finally just taken off the air (thank goodness!) but we still have lame ducks like This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Rick Mercer that we are paying for, not to mention this poor excuse for \"comedy\" Little Mosque on the Prairie. It is supposed to be offencive and funny? Only the CBC would think this lame show is at all offencive or funny. Shame on the CBC for squandering our tax dollars on shows only a few people would bother

{"value":"Wow You guys are way too nice!!!Corny,Corny,Corny That is how I feel about that film.It started well with a good idea , A guy (Edward Asner) escape from Jail dressed as Santa,a bunch of kids find him and believes his the real Santa so the Fake Santa enlist the children to help him find a bag of stolen money.the film is like a Christmas version of \"Whistle down the wind\". The movie start well but gradually it becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the point that at the end it becomes ridiculous and you just cant take this film seriously. For example you get the Scrooge type character called Sumner (Rene Auberjonois) who's a total Douchebag who treat his young son like a pile a rubbish ,he treat his son so bad that he don't even buy him decent clothes,the poor kid wears Jeans with Holes in it! but a 45 second scene with Fake Santa visiting Sumner and by the end of the film you get the guy all happy singing Christmas Carol and giving his neglected son a hug...yep that is how Corny it is... I'm all for feel good movie especially during Christmas and I am a big fan of seasonal TV movie but this one is way too over the top for me,it is a shame because it started well but the second half of the movie is trowing a supernatural element to the film that just don't match with the rest of it. It's not totally bad,there are some solid acting , especially from the children but there are plenty of better Christmas film

{"value":"This film was absolutely...ugh i can't find the word oh wait... crap! I mean when it started i was like yeah this looks good and then after it was so boring. I nearly fell asleep and it had nothing to do with the fact that i caught a late showing because it was utter filth. Ram Gopal Varma has tried his best but the cast could never live up to the cast of the original Sholay i mean what was he thinking doing a remake. What was he trying to do? Be like Sanjay Leeli Bhansani and win all the awards next year like he did for Black? Ajay and that other guy were good especially the other guy who played raj because out of all of them he was the one to look at. What was Amitabh doing? He's destroying his own dignity by doing all these stupid films. First Nishabd then Cheeni Kum then Jhoom Barabar Jhoom and now this i mean hes got to gather a bit of his money and move as far away from Bollywood as possible before he loses all his respect and I'm telling you he's already past half his way. I mean all this is really good for the other actors like Shah Rukh Khan who's getting a really good name now because of the recent downfall of Amitabh. I never really liked him because he thinks he's God and i just knew Abhishek was going to be in that movie. <br /><br />If you want to save your £17.75 and spend it on something good go watch Heyy

{"value":"I was unsure whether or not Andy Sidaris could repeat his success with the cinematic hit \"Malibu Express.\" With his film Fit to Kill he has proved that Sidaris is a serious filmmaker and not just a one-shot director. The plot written by Sidaris, which was ungratefully passed up by the Academy, is a complex screenplay involving many unseen twists and turns. The main characters composed work for a sexually based radio station known as KSXY. Cleverly, KSXY is actually their secret headquarters. In \"Fit to Kill\" they confront their long-time nemesis Kane, who is trying to steal one of Russia's most prized diamonds. A well-written screenplay is not all, excellent acting by the cast helps to ensure this film as a cult classic. Panned by the critics and the box office, this film will be appreciated in years to come. It is now suffering the same fate as Clockwork Orange and Taxi Driver did, but in the future will undoubtly become recognized. I am disappointed no critic circles have recognized Andy Sidaris's trademark filmmaking. The costumes, the special effects, all help to compliment this already beautiful piece of filmmaking. It may do you best to ignore the dismal 3 rating on this film and go out and rent it for yourself. My personal rating is 10/10. The drama is as thick as the blockbuster Runaway Bride, and the action better or equal to the cinematic masterpiece Last Action Hero.

{"value":"If this movie was about a fictional character, the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the movie is based on \"facts\" that are shaded very unfairly toward Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller facts were disregarded (Carter was NOT number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of \"racist\" judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be (was arrested multiple times for beating women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to. Everyone knows that Jewison can direct, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me. Is Hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable? (Heres a suggestion How about Denzel playing a movie about himself? Now thats inspirational) Based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie, I would suggest passing on this one.","finished_norm":["if","thi","movi","be","about","a","fiction","charact","the","movi","can","stand","on","it","own","and","be","judg","object","unfortun","for","the","viewer","the","movi","be","base","on","fact","that","be","shade","veri","unfairli","toward","ruben","carter","mani","of","the","small","fact","be","disregard","carter","be","not","numb","on","contend","at","the","time","of","the","murder","there","be","no","proof","at","all","that","he","save","a","friend","from","a","child","molest","in","hi","youth","but","some","of","the","larg","fact","like","appar","be","rob","of","a","decis","to","joei","giardello","becaus","of","racist","judg","be","inexcus","to","that","of","u","who","have","see","the","fight","on","tape","and","complet","disrespect","to","giardello","why","hollywood","feel","the","ne","to","make","a","hero","out","of","someon","who","at","well","be","in","troubl","and","around","troubl","much","much","than","ani","normal","person","should","be","be","arrest","multipl","time","for","beat","woman","be","strang","to","me","ruben","carter","be","never","by","view","hi","action","in","the","and","even","now","when","he","refus","to","speak","to","hi","son","a","person","that","peopl","can","look","up","to","everyon","know","that","jewison","can","direct","and","washington","can","act","but","why","thei","choos","thi","stori","a","their","vehicl","be","beyond","me","be","hollywood","so","much","in","ne","of","a","black","hero","that","thei","ne","to","bend","the","truth","in","all","of","their","bio","pic","to","make","them","believ","here","a","suggest","how","about","denzel","plai","a","movi","about","himself","now","that","inspir","base","on","all","of","the","inaccuraci","in","the","movi","i","would","suggest","pass","on","thi","on"],"filtered":["thi","movi","fiction","charact","movi","stand","judg","object","unfortun","viewer","movi","base","fact","shade","veri","unfairli","toward","ruben","carter","mani","small","fact","disregard","carter","numb","contend","time","murder","proof","save","friend","child","molest","hi","youth","larg","fact","like","appar","rob","decis","joei","giardello","becaus","racist","judg","inexcus","u","see","fight","tape","complet","disrespect","giardello","hollywood","feel","ne","make","hero","someon","well","troubl","around","troubl","much","much","ani","normal","person","arrest","multipl","time","beat","woman","strang","ruben","carter","never","view","hi","action","even","refus","speak","hi","son","person","peopl","look","everyon","know","jewison","direct","washington","act","thei","choos","thi","stori","vehicl","beyond","hollywood","much","ne","black","hero","thei","ne","bend","truth","bio","pic","make","believ","suggest","denzel","plai","movi","inspir","base","inaccuraci","movi","suggest","pass","thi"],"filtered2":["fiction","charact","stand","judg","object","unfortun","viewer","base","fact","shade","veri","unfairli","toward","ruben","carter","mani","small","fact","disregard","carter","numb","contend","time","murder","proof","save","friend","child","molest","youth","larg","fact","like","appar","rob","decis","joei","giardello","becaus","racist","judg","inexcus","u","see","fight","tape","complet","disrespect","giardello","hollywood","feel","ne","make","hero","someon","well","troubl","around","troubl","ani","normal","person","arrest","multipl","time","beat","woman","strang","ruben","carter","never","view","action","even","refus","speak","son","person","peopl","look","everyon","know","jewison","direct","washington","act","choos","stori","vehicl","beyond","hollywood","ne","black","hero","ne","bend","truth","bio","pic","make","believ","suggest","denzel","plai","inspir","base","inaccuraci","suggest","pass"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,8,10,15,16,17,20,21,22,23,26,27,40,42,43,50,70,91,97,98,102,103,110,112,129,139,153,161,180,189,227,229,233,246,273,279,300,308,312,334,344,363,375,377,417,434,487,502,516,563,564,584,646,678,700,752,758,909,916,1023,1261,1403,1423,1483,1545,1553,1640,1877,1982,1995,2014,2127,3110,3418,3454,3527,3744,3879,4058,4149,4459,5581,6069,6468,6852],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,8,10,15,16,17,20,21,22,23,26,27,40,42,43,50,70,91,97,98,102,103,110,112,129,139,153,161,180,189,227,229,233,246,273,279,300,308,312,334,344,363,375,377,417,434,487,502,516,563,564,584,646,678,700,752,758,909,916,1023,1261,1403,1423,1483,1545,1553,1640,1877,1982,1995,2014,2127,3110,3418,3454,3527,3744,3879,4058,4149,4459,5581,6069,6468,6852],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028

{"value":"I notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings (1969-1972), or not old enough to appreciate them. I think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it.<br /><br />I was a youngster at the time of Apollo, but I was old enough to understand what was going on. The entire world followed the moon landings. Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch. Newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings-on each day, from launch to landing, from moonwalks to moon liftoff, all the way to splashdown, in a multitude of languages. In school, some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on TV. During Apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate. You couldn't go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was. The world was truly one community. <br /><br />Now with a buffer of 30-odd years after the fact, it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down. We are left with our history books, and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to \"prove\" it with a bunch of lies and made-up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of

{"value":"This is not a good movie. It's disjointed, all the acting is bad, and has a lame story you've seen a thousand times done much better else where. Not to mention you can see every plot point coming from a mile away. Worst of all, no one bothered to tell Lonette Mckee she can't sing. But who cares, she's sooooo damn good looking. But I digress, nothing new here. Bottom-line, hot girl group gets taken advantage of, some one gets hooked on drugs, someone gets hooked on a guy, some one gets the hell out, and then the horrible stuff happens. Surprise, surprise. Welcome to the music business. I can't believe so many people out there think this is a good movie. So many of you seem to want to use a sliding scale when it comes to grading Black Movies. I don't play that! If you want to support these films by going to see them - great! If you enjoyed it - super! To each his own. But don't try to tell me it was good. Pleeeease! I wish colored folks would not fawn over these kind of movies just because they feature black actors. Wanna see a good African-American movie? See Love Jones. Ray. Or The Color Purple. Those would be great movies no matter what the color of the actors skin. Why? Because they told compelling stories with great acting, that made you feel something long after you left the theater. Just because it's our experience does not automatically make it a good film. It's only good -- when it's good.

{"value":"I cant believe some people actually like this. Yet still call themselves Batman fans. Even going as far as to say it's better than BTAS. Which it's not. It should be plagiarism for them to use Batman's name for this piece of crap. It's not Batman.<br /><br />The whole premise of the show is ''if you cant defeat someone get a bigger weapon to help you'' Batman isn't all about weapons. He uses his batarang and grappling hook and Batmobile, thats it. He doesn't come up with some new ingenious tech every time he cant beat someone. I don't know where the hell they got the idea for a Batbot. or whatever. They have ruined all the villains. Mr. Freeze has gone from a sympathetic scientist to a petty criminal who fell in some cryofreezing thing. Catwoman is now a 40 or 50 year old woman with a dumb costume. Penguin is now a ninja with a 50 ft. tall top hat. The Ventriloquist is now called Scarface making the Dummy the whole centerpiece for the character. They even got a dumb idea to make him a giant! wtf? and the two worst character changes are that of The Joker and Riddler. they have changed Riddler to a Gothic/retro teenage freak. and The Joker to an acrobat with dreads.

{"value":"It's one of the funny things about being young that one can be fooled easily by advertising. I have spoken before on another film,in which the commercial for the (comedy) film makes it seem funnier than it is. Seeing the ad for this in 1981 made me think this was going to be a wildly funny film. What I and my brother who went and saw it with me didn't know is that the scene used in the TV ad was the very last scene in the film! <br /><br />Since this scene is the end result of all that came before in the film,I can only guess that there was nothing else funny to use! The last scene is,thanks to a youth potion,Dr. Fu Manchu turns from a long bearded old man,into a bright young Asian/Elvis like rock star! (With back up singers no less!) <br /><br />Set for no real reason,in the 1930's,Peter Sellers does his best with the material at hand but he's not given any really good reason for his \"comedic\" moments. The rest of the actors were just plain dull and my brother and I sat all through this barely laughing at anything. It was only natural that we were expecting a \"Pink Panther\" type comedy,Peter Sellers was so great at that. <br /><br />It's a pitiful shame this was his last film before he died. His appearance on the Muppet Show was more entertaining than this ill-conceived flop. Still,I don't fault him. I fault everyone else involved for not trying to make a better film of this. 2 stars is being

{"value":"I am sick and tired of all these little weenies going on about how this movie \"rocked\". It is pure CG over-acted CRAP! Don't send an Assassin, it's much more sensible to smuggle hundreds of brightly colored, aggressive, venomous Snakes on a Plane! The only reason people like this movie because they feel they have to. It is not \"so bad it's good\" It's so bad I'd rather be poked in the eye with a sharp stick then be subjected to this again. I honestly thought was going to be a COMEDY like AIRPLANE! A spoof! Was I wrong. It's that whole \"It sucks, get it!\" Or Samuel A. Jackson yells \"Snakes on the Plane! thing. Well I'm sorry, I don't get it. It looks like a bunch of wimps gave the movie industry more money to make more movies like Triple X and Die Hard. If you what spend money to watch a movie in the company of the same people who bought William Hung's CD, still live in their mommies basement, and stink of plastic chair sweat from days on the computer playing online games and looking at porn, then rush to the theater and ask for one (since I doubt you have a girlfriend) ticket for Snakes on a stupid-butt Plane. To hell with movies like Full metal Jacket, Pulp Fiction, True Romance, 12 Monkeys, Clerks, etc. There's no irony in watching good movies. The true decline of the western civilization. Calling this a cult film is an Insult to true Cult classics like Repo man, or even Orgazmo.

{"value":"C'mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode. It's just an old 60's TV show ! This episode of Star Trek is notable because of the most serious babe (Yeoman Barrow's) ever used on Star Trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location. Unlike the TNG and Voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages.<br /><br />This use of an outdoor location (and babe) gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show.<br /><br />Except a few notable exceptions i.e \"The city on the edge of forever\" , \"assignment Earth\" and \"Tomorrow is Yesterday\" The old series of Star Trek needs to be seriously moth-balled and put out of it's boring misery. Half a dozen good episodes from 79 is quite a poor batting average.<br /><br />This is typical of the boring stuff Gene Roddenberry produced back then actually, contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on, he actually made a LOT of rubbish! He doesn't deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as Irwin Allen for example.<br /><br />Just look at the set of the bridge of the Enterprise from a modern point of view.

{"value":"Wow. This was probably the worst DCOM ever. I watched the first half hour and I laughed. Brenda Song plays Wendy, the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be Homecoming Queen. She is supposed to save the world as a warrior, and Shin comes to her aid to help her with her Martial Arts. Shin teaches her the skills of a snake, tiger, etc. and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world.<br /><br />This movie is great for kids who want to learn about Martial Arts and the Chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible.<br /><br />Brenda Song is a comedic actress and I can't see her playing a serious role. It was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over Shin. Shin couldn't act at all, and everything was totally unbelievable.<br /><br />I watched this movie and tried to think of something similar, and the thing I came up with was the Power Rangers. This movie is so fake and the stunts were so Power Ranger-esquire that it was just corny and stupid. The characters weren't likable and I just couldn't stand to watch it. Disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies.

{"value":"Every Sunday, a trio of buds get together at a NYC diner to boast about their sexual conquests of the night before. Sometimes they're joined by a newlywed ex-comrade and hoochie hunter who hangs on them like a puling barnacle. They're unabashed horn dogs/corn dogs and Mia, who witnesses them on the prowl, decides that they need to be taught a lesson, dammit. Ergo, she'll date and dump - why not? All three of them! <br /><br />Gasp. What a wild idea. What a radical, naughty gal. Women now have the right to date and sleep around as much as they want to. As much as men do, even! <br /><br />There is one solitary laughable element in \"Whipped\" - namely the fact that not once, during the amigo's detailed discussions of their bodily functions and the tantric talents of the bed partners they trash, do the other customers in the diner turn around and say, \"Dude, we're trying to EAT here.\" Indeed, a heh-heh gag has an older lady eagerly weigh in on the useful sexual properties of certain beverages. A big fat Kermit the Frog \"Sheesh\" to that.<br /><br />It's truly unfortunate that a buddy movie with a great setting, a smart, cute heroine and three possible pairings had to have such a cop-out ending.<br /><br />P.S. - 30 \"whip-oosh\" sound effects to the screenwriter for use of the phrase \"You go, girl\". It was tired in 2000, and it's tired now.<br /><br />Save your time and watch some \"Sex and the City\"

{"value":"The problem with family dramas is that, outside of TV movies on channels like Lifetime, most people don't want to watch them. And the ones that do get watched tend to be sensationalized and about current or topical problems or issues in the news (or recent news). Movies that explain or explore the human condition aren't popular. Particularly with the young crowd that would be Miss Lohan's fan base or the younger crowd that tends to make movies not simply popular but financially successful for studios.<br /><br />The specific problems I had with this movie is the cartoonishness of some of the characterizations. It was a bit much to blame all of the Lohan's character's acting-out (wrecking the car, drug use, etc.) on what her step-father did to her. While not improbable,it's just a bit much to expect the audience to swallow. Additionally, other aspects, such as her giving the young Morman boy, oral sex, or that she would actually make a good assistant to the vet, who coincidentally happens to have a thing for her mother, etc., all these elements just did not really help this movie along. It placed it more in the element of a situation comedy trying one of their \"special dramatic episodes\" then it did for a fully realized, well-written feature film.<br /><br />When you watch the DVD and listen to the commentary, particularly for the various alternate endings, you can really see all of this is sharp focus.","finished_norm":["the","problem","with","famili","drama","be","that","outsid","of","tv","movi","on","channel","like","lifetim","much","peopl","do","not","want","to","watch","them","and","the","on","that","do","get","watch","tend","to","be","sensation","and","about","current","or","topic","problem","or","issu","in","the","new","or","recent","new","movi","that","explain","or","explor","the","human","condit","be","not","popular","particularli","with","the","young","crowd","that","would","be","miss","lohan","fan","base","or","the","young","crowd","that","tend","to","make","movi","not","simpli","popular","but","financi","success","for","studiosbr","br","the","specif","problem","i","have","with","thi","movi","be","the","cartoonish","of","some","of","the","character","it","be","a","bite","much","to","blame","all","of","the","lohan","charact","actingout","wreck","the","car","drug","us","etc","on","what","her","stepfath","do","to","her","while","not","improbableit","just","a","bite","much","to","expect","the","audienc","to","swallow","addition","other","aspect","such","a","her","give","the","young","morman","boi","oral","sex","or","that","she","would","actual","make","a","good","assist","to","the","vet","who","coincident","happen","to","have","a","thing","for","her","mother","etc","all","thi","elem","just","do","not","realli","help","thi","movi","along","it","place","it","much","in","the","elem","of","a","situat","comedi","try","on","of","their","special","dramat","episod","then","it","do","for","a","fulli","realiz","wellwritten","featur","filmbr","br","when","you","watch","the","dvd","and","listen","to","the","commentari","particularli","for","the","variou","altern","end","you","can","realli","see","all","of","thi","be","sharp","focu"],"filtered":["problem","famili","drama","outsid","tv","movi","channel","like","lifetim","much","peopl","want","watch","get","watch","tend","sensation","current","topic","problem","issu","new","recent","new","movi","explain","explor","human","condit","popular","particularli","young","crowd","miss","lohan","fan","base","young","crowd","tend","make","movi","simpli","popular","financi","success","studiosbr","br","specif","problem","thi","movi","cartoonish","character","bite","much","blame","lohan","charact","actingout","wreck","car","drug","us","etc","stepfath","improbableit","bite","much","expect","audienc","swallow","addition","aspect","give","young","morman","boi","oral","sex","actual","make","good","assist","vet","coincident","happen","thing","mother","etc","thi","elem","realli","help","thi","movi","along","place","much","elem","situat","comedi","try","special","dramat","episod","fulli","realiz","wellwritten","featur","filmbr","br","watch","dvd","listen","commentari","particularli","variou","altern","end","realli","see","thi","sharp","focu"],"filtered2":["problem","famili","drama","outsid","tv","channel","like","lifetim","peopl","want","watch","get","watch","tend","sensation","current","topic","problem","issu","new","recent","new","explain","explor","human","condit","popular","particularli","young","crowd","miss","lohan","fan","base","young","crowd","tend","make","simpli","popular","financi","success","studiosbr","specif","problem","cartoonish","character","bite","blame","lohan","charact","actingout","wreck","car","drug","us","etc","stepfath","improbableit","bite","expect","audienc","swallow","addition","aspect","give","young","morman","boi","oral","sex","actual","make","good","assist","vet","coincident","happen","thing","mother","etc","elem","realli","help","along","place","elem","situat","comedi","try","special","dramat","fulli","realiz","wellwritten","featur","filmbr","watch","dvd","listen","commentari","particularli","variou","altern","end","realli","see","sharp","focu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,10,13,23,24,29,30,36,37,52,56,87,94,127,130,135,140,154,164,167,168,172,182,185,201,203,247,254,255,282,284,292,305,324,334,395,397,405,429,463,473,479,497,532,562,566,619,645,697,728,756,791,806,845,898,942,951,1291,1360,1367,1457,1621,1662,1711,1720,1786,1883,1897,1976,2037,2041,2559,2930,2935,3672,3806,4437,5636,5795,5971,6020,6876,8603],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,10,13,23,24,29,30,36,37,52,56,87,94,127,130,135,140,154,164,167,168,172,182,185,201,203,247,254,255,282,284,292,305,324,334,395,397,405,429,463,473,479,497,532,562,566,619,645,697,728,756,791,806,845,898,942,951,1291,1360,1367,1457,1621,1662,1711,1720,1786,1883,1897,1976,2037,2041,2559,2930,2935,3672,3806,4437,5636,5795,5971,6020,6876,8603],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054

{"value":"This is one of the worst action films I have ever seen. This is particularly due to much of the factual implausibility (like an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though 'it has not found a viable host' does not mean that it will never find one), the cheap sets (the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a dungeon), and the bad acting. It is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus. However, the head honcho who decides to remove it from a bank security deposit box, does so at the same time a bank heist is going down, at the same FBI agents have been informed of this, and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts. Needless to say, the aftermath of the quake is messy in more ways than one. However, the results do not make for an enticing action film, but instead, one that has been obviously z-grade junk from the beginning of the film. (Perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film). What the hell Ron Perlman was doing in this, I have no idea. I wonder if he was as embarrassed to be in it as I was to have watched

{"value":"Oh God, I must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve, (don't ask how) I may have been young, but I wasn't stupid. Anyone could see that this is a bad movie, nasty, gross, unscary and very silly. I've seen more impressive effects at Disneyland, I've seen better performances at a school play, And I've seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo, where they do nothing but sit in the water, ignoring the children tapping on the glass.<br /><br />The story is set in northern Australia. A handful of ambitious young people, are trying out a new water sport, surfing in shark filled waters. It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water. After they learn what, they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman, who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family.<br /><br />I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years, the best of which is Lake Placid, and the worse of which is its sequel. Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think, with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind.<br /><br />The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there, resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year. Movies like Blood Surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature, but a good hour and a half of the viewer's life. Unless you really want to see it, avoid Blood

{"value":"Scary Movie 3 (2003) was a bad idea to begin with. The last film was a mediocre effort. Put it next to this load, it's a comedy classic. Whilst part two was filled with a lot of dated humor and cheap shots, at least it was funny. There's nothing funny about forced humor. Jokes, pratfalls and sight gags are supposed to be naturally funny. Hitting the viewer over the head with tired jokes is not cool. The humor in this film was caters to juvenile imbeciles who'll laugh at anything. When they catered to the junior high school crowd, any sense of self respect was tossed out the window. Ring parodies are not funny. I have watched them in comedies since 1998. They're so dated. Michael Jackson jokes are not cool either. What's even worse is making fun of two broken down has been \"performers\" whose best days were NEVER.<br /><br />The death of American cinema has been a slow one. Films like this are the nails that are being pounded into it's coffin. Whatever happened to real humor? I haven't laughed out loud in a movie theater in a long time. Too many bad movies rot the brain. You want proof? Go to your local mega chain video rental store and see what's on the shelves. This movie is bad. Don't believe the hype. I would rather watch Scary Movie 2 in a continuous loop than to suffer through this poor excuse of a comedy ever again!<br /><br />Definitely not recommended (unless you have a handful of brain cells).","finished_norm":["scari","movi","be","a","bad","idea","to","begin","with","the","last","film","be","a","mediocr","effort","put","it","next","to","thi","load","it","a","comedi","classic","whilst","part","two","be","fill","with","a","lot","of","date","humor","and","cheap","shot","at","littl","it","be","funni","there","noth","funni","about","forc","humor","joke","pratfal","and","sight","gag","be","suppos","to","be","natur","funni","hit","the","viewer","over","the","head","with","tire","joke","be","not","cool","the","humor","in","thi","film","be","cater","to","juvenil","imbecil","who","will","laugh","at","anyth","when","thei","cater","to","the","junior","high","school","crowd","ani","sens","of","self","respect","be","toss","out","the","window","ring","parodi","be","not","funni","i","have","watch","them","in","comedi","sinc","thei","re","so","date","michael","jackson","joke","be","not","cool","either","what","even","wrong","be","make","fun","of","two","break","down","have","be","perform","whose","well","dai","be","neverbr","br","the","death","of","american","cinema","have","be","a","slow","on","film","like","thi","be","the","nail","that","be","be","pound","into","it","coffin","whatev","happen","to","real","humor","i","have","not","laugh","out","loud","in","a","movi","theater","in","a","long","time","too","mani","bad","movi","rot","the","brain","you","want","proof","go","to","your","local","mega","chain","video","rental","store","and","see","what","on","the","shelv","thi","movi","be","bad","do","not","believ","the","hyp","i","would","rather","watch","scari","movi","in","a","continu","loop","than","to","suffer","through","thi","poor","excus","of","a","comedi","ever","againbr","br","definit","not","recommend","unless","you","have","a","hand","of","brain","cell"],"filtered":["scari","movi","bad","idea","begin","last","film","mediocr","effort","put","next","thi","load","comedi","classic","whilst","part","two","fill","lot","date","humor","cheap","shot","littl","funni","noth","funni","forc","humor","joke","pratfal","sight","gag","suppos","natur","funni","hit","viewer","head","tire","joke","cool","humor","thi","film","cater","juvenil","imbecil","laugh","anyth","thei","cater","junior","high","school","crowd","ani","sens","self","respect","toss","window","ring","parodi","funni","watch","comedi","sinc","thei","re","date","michael","jackson","joke","cool","either","even","wrong","make","fun","two","break","perform","whose","well","dai","neverbr","br","death","american","cinema","slow","film","like","thi","nail","pound","coffin","whatev","happen","real","humor","laugh","loud","movi","theater","long","time","mani","bad","movi","rot","brain","want","proof","go","local","mega","chain","video","rental","store","see","shelv","thi","movi","bad","believ","hyp","rather","watch","scari","movi","continu","loop","suffer","thi","poor","excus","comedi","ever","againbr","br","definit","recommend","unless","hand","brain","cell"],"filtered2":["scari","bad","idea","begin","last","mediocr","effort","put","next","load","comedi","classic","whilst","part","two","fill","lot","date","humor","cheap","shot","littl","funni","noth","funni","forc","humor","joke","pratfal","sight","gag","suppos","natur","funni","hit","viewer","head","tire","joke","cool","humor","cater","juvenil","imbecil","laugh","anyth","cater","junior","high","school","crowd","ani","sens","self","respect","toss","window","ring","parodi","funni","watch","comedi","sinc","re","date","michael","jackson","joke","cool","either","even","wrong","make","fun","two","break","perform","whose","well","dai","neverbr","death","american","cinema","slow","like","nail","pound","coffin","whatev","happen","real","humor","laugh","loud","theater","long","time","mani","bad","rot","brain","want","proof","go","local","mega","chain","video","rental","store","see","shelv","bad","believ","hyp","rather","watch","scari","continu","loop","suffer","poor","excus","comedi","ever","againbr","definit","recommend","unless","hand","brain","cell"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9,14,20,25,27,37,44,47,49,50,61,62,68,72,80,91,94,99,104,105,123,127,132,133,144,146,147,149,159,160,162,173,207,208,211,214,223,235,240,245,259,279,296,297,298,332,338,351,360,369,388,390,392,396,401,409,424,433,441,456,460,466,475,481,553,557,598,617,633,647,673,694,787,793,900,957,998,1084,1108,1280,1294,1296,1357,1505,1532,1589,1654,1720,1731,1982,2108,2215,2266,2301,2434,2597,3155,3459,3834,4691,4763,4937,6086,7405],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":

{"value":"Kudos to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours and hours in the makeup room each day to look the part of Zola. Muni was the one of the biggest stars in the 1930s and I wonder how many people today -other than classic movie buffs - know anything about it. He was a giant in the business for at least a decade. He could have won the Academy Award for this performance, which would have given him two in a row, as he won it for playing Louis Pasteur the year before. My own opinion is that while he tended to overact a bit, I still think he was one of the great actors of the \"Golden Age.\" Whatever part he played; you were riveted to the screen watching him.<br /><br />Unlike the Pasteur role, I thought this story smacked of a little too much of what we've seen in the last 60 years: going overboard to make a Liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood couldn't suppress its disdain for police or for the military, here making it a point to tell us how \"corrupt\" those organizations are. Filmmakers just love it when authority is challenged and defeated. In that regard, this film is way ahead of its day since we've seen this big-time since the 1960s.<br /><br />However, it must be noted the facts support this story. It also does not in any way diminish Zola's accomplishments as a social reformer, getting rid of certain evils. Good for him! I wish they had spent more time showing that, than concentrating on one trial.","finished_norm":["kudo","to","the","patienc","of","paul","muni","who","spend","hour","and","hour","in","the","makeup","room","each","dai","to","look","the","part","of","zola","muni","be","the","on","of","the","big","star","in","the","and","i","wonder","how","mani","peopl","todai","other","than","classic","movi","buff","know","anyth","about","it","he","be","a","giant","in","the","busi","for","at","littl","a","decad","he","can","have","win","the","academi","award","for","thi","perform","which","would","have","give","him","two","in","a","row","a","he","win","it","for","plai","loui","pasteur","the","year","befor","my","own","opinion","be","that","while","he","tend","to","overact","a","bite","i","still","think","he","be","on","of","the","great","actor","of","the","golden","ag","whatev","part","he","plai","you","be","rivet","to","the","screen","watch","himbr","br","unlik","the","pasteur","role","i","think","thi","stori","smack","of","a","littl","too","much","of","what","we","have","see","in","the","last","year","go","overboard","to","make","a","liber","hero","even","in","hollywood","can","not","suppress","it","disdain","for","polic","or","for","the","militari","here","make","it","a","point","to","tell","u","how","corrupt","that","organ","be","filmmak","just","love","it","when","author","be","challeng","and","defeat","in","that","regard","thi","film","be","wai","ahead","of","it","dai","sinc","we","have","see","thi","bigtim","sinc","the","sbr","br","howev","it","must","be","note","the","fact","support","thi","stori","it","conjur","doe","not","in","ani","wai","diminish","zola","accomplish","a","a","social","reform","get","rid","of","certain","evil","good","for","him","i","wish","thei","have","spend","much","time","show","that","than","concentr","on","on","trial"],"filtered":["kudo","patienc","paul","muni","spend","hour","hour","makeup","room","dai","look","part","zola","muni","big","star","wonder","mani","peopl","todai","classic","movi","buff","know","anyth","giant","busi","littl","decad","win","academi","award","thi","perform","give","two","row","win","plai","loui","pasteur","year","befor","opinion","tend","overact","bite","still","think","great","actor","golden","ag","whatev","part","plai","rivet","screen","watch","himbr","br","unlik","pasteur","role","think","thi","stori","smack","littl","much","see","last","year","go","overboard","make","liber","hero","even","hollywood","suppress","disdain","polic","militari","make","point","tell","u","corrupt","organ","filmmak","love","author","challeng","defeat","regard","thi","film","wai","ahead","dai","sinc","see","thi","bigtim","sinc","sbr","br","howev","must","note","fact","support","thi","stori","conjur","doe","ani","wai","diminish","zola","accomplish","social","reform","get","rid","certain","evil","good","wish","thei","spend","much","time","show","concentr","trial"],"filtered2":["kudo","patienc","paul","muni","spend","hour","hour","makeup","room","dai","look","part","zola","muni","big","star","wonder","mani","peopl","todai","classic","buff","know","anyth","giant","busi","littl","decad","win","academi","award","perform","give","two","row","win","plai","loui","pasteur","year","befor","opinion","tend","overact","bite","still","think","great","actor","golden","ag","whatev","part","plai","rivet","screen","watch","himbr","unlik","pasteur","role","think","stori","smack","littl","see","last","year","go","overboard","make","liber","hero","even","hollywood","suppress","disdain","polic","militari","make","point","tell","u","corrupt","organ","filmmak","love","author","challeng","defeat","regard","wai","ahead","dai","sinc","see","bigtim","sinc","sbr","howev","must","note","fact","support","stori","conjur","doe","ani","wai","diminish","zola","accomplish","social","reform","get","rid","certain","evil","good","wish","spend","time","show","concentr","trial"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,14,16,17,18,23,26,27,28,30,33,39,40,41,47,50,51,54,57,61,64,66,79,82,90,97,100,104,105,112,113,128,132,141,144,154,162,174,175,192,283,300,321,323,332,375,399,442,459,471,489,513,538,557,560,615,774,789,790,840,907,960,975,984,1004,1019,1111,1196,1322,1415,1462,1591,1711,1783,1880,1887,1906,2000,2027,2261,2326,2507,2571,2599,2789,2929,3452,3994,4030,4063,4090,5049,5459,5871,6065,6469,7594],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,14,16,17,18,23,26,27,28,30,33,39,40,41,47,50,51,54,57,61,64,66,79,82,90,97,100,104,105,112,113,128,132,141,144,154,162,174,175,192,283,300,321,323,332,375,399,442,459,471,489,513,538,557,56

{"value":"Hey everyone...<br /><br />There really isn't much to say for this movie at all. The basic plot is that a guy (Brandon) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work. After picking up a girl on the way there, things start going badly wrong for all of them.<br /><br />The storyline alone (written by the actor playing Brandon, I believe, although I could be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and is acted out accordingly. The \"Clown Killer\" himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. Far from being a dark, mysterious but most of all, intelligent predator, we are instead offered a rather clumsy, nursery rhyme-singing buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis. The only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film (the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things).<br /><br />In short, this film falls below every possible set standard. Admittedly, I was sharing a few beers with a close friend as I watched this, so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that S.I.C.K did fall just shy of a two rating. However, in reality, (and with the benefit of hindsight) the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film.<br /><br />1 star out of ten.","finished_norm":["hei","everyonebr","br","there","realli","be","not","much","to","sai","for","thi","movi","at","all","the","basic","plot","be","that","a","gui","brandon","take","a","few","friend","on","a","trip","to","hi","cabin","in","the","wood","for","a","weekend","holidai","awai","from","work","after","pick","up","a","girl","on","the","wai","there","thing","start","go","badli","wrong","for","all","of","thembr","br","the","storylin","alon","write","by","the","actor","plai","brandon","i","believ","although","i","can","be","wrong","here","be","unlik","and","unconvinc","and","be","act","out","accordingli","the","clown","killer","himself","be","a","rather","a","sad","excus","for","a","psychot","killer","far","from","be","a","dark","mysteri","but","much","of","all","intellig","predat","we","be","instead","offer","a","rather","clumsi","nurseri","rhymesing","buffoon","who","appear","to","be","go","through","a","minor","mid","life","crisi","the","onli","thing","that","warrant","the","write","of","thi","comment","be","the","sex","scene","and","whatev","gore","there","be","in","the","film","the","qualiti","of","the","film","lead","me","to","deriv","some","enjoy","out","of","such","thingsbr","br","in","short","thi","film","fall","below","everi","possibl","set","standard","admittedli","i","be","share","a","few","beer","with","a","close","friend","a","i","watch","thi","so","we","manag","to","scrape","togeth","some","rel","entertain","valu","out","of","thi","film","and","it","be","therefor","onli","fair","to","mention","that","sick","do","fall","just","shy","of","a","two","rate","howev","in","realiti","and","with","the","benefit","of","hindsight","the","on","star","rate","be","a","much","than","legitim","score","for","thi","filmbr","br","star","out","of","ten"],"filtered":["hei","everyonebr","br","realli","much","sai","thi","movi","basic","plot","gui","brandon","take","friend","trip","hi","cabin","wood","weekend","holidai","awai","work","pick","girl","wai","thing","start","go","badli","wrong","thembr","br","storylin","alon","write","actor","plai","brandon","believ","although","wrong","unlik","unconvinc","act","accordingli","clown","killer","rather","sad","excus","psychot","killer","far","dark","mysteri","much","intellig","predat","instead","offer","rather","clumsi","nurseri","rhymesing","buffoon","appear","go","minor","mid","life","crisi","onli","thing","warrant","write","thi","comment","sex","scene","whatev","gore","film","qualiti","film","lead","deriv","enjoy","thingsbr","br","short","thi","film","fall","everi","possibl","set","standard","admittedli","share","beer","close","friend","watch","thi","manag","scrape","togeth","rel","entertain","valu","thi","film","therefor","onli","fair","mention","sick","fall","shy","two","rate","howev","realiti","benefit","hindsight","star","rate","much","legitim","score","thi","filmbr","br","star","ten"],"filtered2":["hei","everyonebr","realli","basic","plot","gui","brandon","take","friend","trip","cabin","wood","weekend","holidai","awai","work","pick","girl","wai","thing","start","go","badli","wrong","thembr","storylin","alon","write","actor","plai","brandon","believ","although","wrong","unlik","unconvinc","act","accordingli","clown","killer","rather","sad","excus","psychot","killer","far","dark","mysteri","intellig","predat","instead","offer","rather","clumsi","nurseri","rhymesing","buffoon","appear","go","minor","mid","life","crisi","onli","thing","warrant","write","comment","sex","scene","whatev","gore","qualiti","lead","deriv","enjoy","thingsbr","short","fall","everi","possibl","set","standard","admittedli","share","beer","close","friend","watch","manag","scrape","togeth","rel","entertain","valu","therefor","onli","fair","mention","sick","fall","shy","two","rate","howev","realiti","benefit","hindsight","star","rate","legitim","score","filmbr","star","ten"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,7,11,13,19,21,25,29,31,32,33,40,41,47,48,55,65,71,75,84,85,91,100,101,109,113,152,155,157,160,161,169,170,195,202,237,252,254,270,272,280,285,286,295,319,345,358,368,402,403,446,448,451,455,457,507,515,518,545,557,566,603,615,616,617,655,656,737,778,877,974,1042,1097,1124,1165,1229,1369,1399,1565,1610,2031,2035,2089,2259,2309,2379,2419,2442,2614,2957,3378,3456,4033,4118,4485,5220,5237,7225,8263],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,7,11,13,19,21,25,29,31,32,33,40,41,47,48,55,65,71,75,84,85,91,100,101,109,113,152,155,157,160,161,169,170,195,202,237,252,254,270,272,280,285,286,295,319,345,358,368,402,403,446,448,451,455,457,507,515,518,545,557,566,603,615,616,617,655

{"value":"This could have been interesting  a Japan-set haunted house story from the viewpoint of a newly-installed American family  but falls flat due to an over-simplified treatment and the unsuitability of both cast and director.<br /><br />The film suffers from the same problem I often encounter with the popular modern renaissance of such native fare, i.e. the fact that the spirits demonstrate themselves to be evil for no real reason other than that they're expected to! Besides, it doesn't deliver much in the scares department  a giant crab attack is merely silly  as, generally, the ghosts inhabit a specific character and cause him or her to act in a totally uncharacteristic way, such as Susan George seducing diplomat/friend-of-the-family Doug McClure and Edward Albert force-feeding his daughter a bowl of soup! <br /><br />At one point, an old monk turns up at the house to warn Albert of the danger if they remain there  eventually, he's called upon to exorcise the premises. However, history is bound to repeat itself and tragedy is the only outcome of the tense situation duly created  leading to a violent yet unintentionally funny climax in which Albert and McClure, possessed by the spirits of their Japanese predecessors, engage in an impromptu karate duel to the death! At the end of the day, this emerges an innocuous time-waster  tolerable at just 88 minutes but, in no way, essential viewing.","finished_norm":["thi","can","have","be","interest","a","japanset","haunt","hous","stori","from","the","viewpoint","of","a","newlyinstal","american","famili","but","fall","flat","due","to","a","oversimplifi","treatment","and","the","unsuit","of","both","cast","and","directorbr","br","the","film","suffer","from","the","same","problem","i","often","encount","with","the","popular","modern","renaiss","of","such","nativ","fare","ie","the","fact","that","the","spirit","demonstr","themselv","to","be","evil","for","no","real","reason","other","than","that","thei","re","expect","to","besid","it","doe","not","deliv","much","in","the","scare","depart","a","giant","crab","attack","be","mere","silli","a","gener","the","ghost","inhabit","a","specif","charact","and","caus","him","or","her","to","act","in","a","total","uncharacterist","wai","such","a","susan","georg","seduc","diplomatfriendofthefamili","doug","mcclure","and","edward","albert","forcefeed","hi","daughter","a","bowl","of","soup","br","br","at","on","point","a","old","monk","turn","up","at","the","hous","to","warn","albert","of","the","danger","if","thei","remain","there","eventu","he","call","upon","to","exorcis","the","premis","howev","histori","be","bind","to","repeat","itself","and","tragedi","be","the","onli","outcom","of","the","tens","situat","duli","creat","lead","to","a","violent","yet","unintention","funni","climax","in","which","albert","and","mcclure","possess","by","the","spirit","of","their","japanes","predecessor","engag","in","a","impromptu","karat","duel","to","the","death","at","the","end","of","the","dai","thi","emerg","a","innocu","timewast","toler","at","just","minut","but","in","no","wai","essenti","view"],"filtered":["thi","interest","japanset","haunt","hous","stori","viewpoint","newlyinstal","american","famili","fall","flat","due","oversimplifi","treatment","unsuit","cast","directorbr","br","film","suffer","problem","often","encount","popular","modern","renaiss","nativ","fare","ie","fact","spirit","demonstr","themselv","evil","real","reason","thei","re","expect","besid","doe","deliv","much","scare","depart","giant","crab","attack","mere","silli","gener","ghost","inhabit","specif","charact","caus","act","total","uncharacterist","wai","susan","georg","seduc","diplomatfriendofthefamili","doug","mcclure","edward","albert","forcefeed","hi","daughter","bowl","soup","br","br","point","old","monk","turn","hous","warn","albert","danger","thei","remain","eventu","call","upon","exorcis","premis","howev","histori","bind","repeat","tragedi","onli","outcom","tens","situat","duli","creat","lead","violent","yet","unintention","funni","climax","albert","mcclure","possess","spirit","japanes","predecessor","engag","impromptu","karat","duel","death","end","dai","thi","emerg","innocu","timewast","toler","minut","wai","essenti","view"],"filtered2":["interest","japanset","haunt","hous","stori","viewpoint","newlyinstal","american","famili","fall","flat","due","oversimplifi","treatment","unsuit","cast","directorbr","suffer","problem","often","encount","popular","modern","renaiss","nativ","fare","ie","fact","spirit","demonstr","themselv","evil","real","reason","re","expect","besid","doe","deliv","scare","depart","giant","crab","attack","mere","silli","gener","ghost","inhabit","specif","charact","caus","act","total","uncharacterist","wai","susan","georg","seduc","diplomatfriendofthefamili","doug","mcclure","edward","albert","forcefeed","daughter","bowl","soup","point","old","monk","turn","hous","warn","albert","danger","remain","eventu","call","upon","exorcis","premis","howev","histori","bind","repeat","tragedi","onli","outcom","tens","situat","duli","creat","lead","violent","yet","unintention","funni","climax","albert","mcclure","possess","spirit","japanes","predecessor","engag","impromptu","karat","duel","death","end","dai","emerg","innocu","timewast","toler","minut","wai","essenti","view"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,11,17,18,21,24,33,59,60,62,66,67,68,80,92,95,96,97,113,130,132,142,157,167,169,182,184,194,213,223,225,245,312,321,362,385,400,426,436,452,473,484,495,499,517,527,568,593,623,630,633,680,682,716,727,729,837,843,894,907,943,951,966,972,978,986,1136,1197,1262,1288,1305,1365,1416,1662,1675,1740,1776,1817,1818,1860,1875,2010,2062,2153,2366,2381,2661,2948,2970,3204,3229,3237,3281,3575,4228,4495,5562,6139,6191,6234,6244,6515,7831,8234],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,11,17,18,21,24,33,59,60,62,66,67,68,80,92,95,96,97,113,130,132,142,157,167,169,182,184,194,213,223,225,245,312,321,362,385

{"value":"The story idea behind THE LOST MISSILE isn't bad at all, but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the sub-par level.<br /><br />The film begins with a missile heading towards the Earth. In a panic because it's about to strike the Earth, the Soviets manage to deflect the object. This isn't necessarily good, however, as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path AND the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet. In other words, with each pass it makes, a swath of death follows--one that could potentially kill us all!! So, it's up to the good scientists of the US (led by a very young and hardly recognizable Robert Loggia) to formulate and plan to save us--and especially save New York that is in its immediate flight path! Unfortunately, they aren't able to save Ottawa (I've never been there, so I can't say whether or not this is a big loss) but thanks to good old American know-how, they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction!! <br /><br />So, as you can see, the story idea isn't bad and rather original. But, so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding. Overall, a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may like--all others, see it at your own risk.","finished_norm":["the","stori","idea","behind","the","lose","missil","be","not","bad","at","all","but","unfortun","the","stori","doe","get","a","bite","dull","toward","the","middl","and","the","overus","of","stock","footag","a","good","a","poor","special","effect","sink","thi","film","to","the","subpar","levelbr","br","the","film","begin","with","a","missil","head","toward","the","earth","in","a","panic","becaus","it","about","to","strike","the","earth","the","soviet","manag","to","deflect","the","object","thi","be","not","necessarili","good","howev","a","thi","seemingli","unman","craft","have","a","vapor","trail","that","destroi","everyth","in","it","path","and","the","ship","be","now","in","a","low","orbit","over","the","planet","in","other","word","with","each","pass","it","make","a","swath","of","death","followson","that","can","potenti","kill","u","all","so","it","up","to","the","good","scientist","of","the","u","lead","by","a","veri","young","and","hardli","recogniz","robert","loggia","to","formul","and","plan","to","save","usand","especi","save","new","york","that","be","in","it","immedi","flight","path","unfortun","thei","be","not","abl","to","save","ottawa","i","have","never","be","there","so","i","ca","not","sai","whether","or","not","thi","be","a","big","loss","but","thank","to","good","old","american","knowhow","thei","be","abl","to","eventu","destroi","thi","harbing","of","destruct","br","br","so","a","you","can","see","the","stori","idea","be","not","bad","and","rather","origin","but","so","mani","old","clip","of","fighter","plane","and","gui","man","radar","scope","get","a","bite","old","and","it","seem","like","pad","overal","a","decent","but","hardli","inspir","film","that","extrem","fan","of","the","genr","mai","likeal","other","see","it","at","your","own","risk"],"filtered":["stori","idea","behind","lose","missil","bad","unfortun","stori","doe","get","bite","dull","toward","middl","overus","stock","footag","good","poor","special","effect","sink","thi","film","subpar","levelbr","br","film","begin","missil","head","toward","earth","panic","becaus","strike","earth","soviet","manag","deflect","object","thi","necessarili","good","howev","thi","seemingli","unman","craft","vapor","trail","destroi","everyth","path","ship","low","orbit","planet","word","pass","make","swath","death","followson","potenti","kill","u","good","scientist","u","lead","veri","young","hardli","recogniz","robert","loggia","formul","plan","save","usand","especi","save","new","york","immedi","flight","path","unfortun","thei","abl","save","ottawa","never","ca","sai","whether","thi","big","loss","thank","good","old","american","knowhow","thei","abl","eventu","destroi","thi","harbing","destruct","br","br","see","stori","idea","bad","rather","origin","mani","old","clip","fighter","plane","gui","man","radar","scope","get","bite","old","seem","like","pad","overal","decent","hardli","inspir","film","extrem","fan","genr","mai","likeal","see","risk"],"filtered2":["stori","idea","behind","lose","missil","bad","unfortun","stori","doe","get","bite","dull","toward","middl","overus","stock","footag","good","poor","special","effect","sink","subpar","levelbr","begin","missil","head","toward","earth","panic","becaus","strike","earth","soviet","manag","deflect","object","necessarili","good","howev","seemingli","unman","craft","vapor","trail","destroi","everyth","path","ship","low","orbit","planet","word","pass","make","swath","death","followson","potenti","kill","u","good","scientist","u","lead","veri","young","hardli","recogniz","robert","loggia","formul","plan","save","usand","especi","save","new","york","immedi","flight","path","unfortun","abl","save","ottawa","never","ca","whether","big","loss","thank","good","old","american","knowhow","abl","eventu","destroi","harbing","destruct","see","stori","idea","bad","rather","origin","mani","old","clip","fighter","plane","gui","man","radar","scope","get","bite","old","seem","like","pad","overal","decent","hardli","inspir","extrem","fan","genr","mai","likeal","see","risk"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,9,15,17,18,22,35,42,45,46,50,55,67,69,76,81,82,87,106,112,113,123,135,140,146,147,154,157,160,189,193,203,208,217,221,223,227,245,258,267,309,329,345,367,393,412,454,467,487,522,539,547,554,563,581,597,651,658,665,716,738,805,827,909,987,988,1007,1056,1088,1205,1232,1261,1359,1563,1599,1927,1973,2096,2131,2223,2286,2355,2582,2629,2934,3362,3528,3594,3922,4420,4484,6902,7093,7500,7619],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,9,15,17,18,22,35,42,45,46,50,5

{"value":"Dreadful horror sequel to \"The Howling\". This picks off with Karen White's funeral (she was killed at the end of the first film). Stefan Crosscoe (Christopher Lee sadly) arrives there and tells Karen's brother Ben (Reb Brown) that Karen was a werewolf. He's going to Transylvania to kill Striba (Sybil Danning) the head werewolf. Ben and a coworker of Karens (Annie McEnroe) join him.<br /><br />A terrible script, bad direction, inept editing and truly horrendous acting by Brown and McEnroe single handedly sink this one. The werewolf effects are mostly kept in the dark--for good reason! They're terrible when you see them. Subpar special effects also--although I DID like the cartoon lightning that comes from Danning's fingers. There's also a werewolf orgy which is particularly stupid and Danning takes off her top at least EIGHT TIMES during the closing credits! <br /><br />There are a few good things--I found the village in Transylvania amusing--it looks like it came from a Universal horror flick from the 1930s! There are interesting camera tricks between transition scenes; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good in this--but they can't save it. Really--WHY did they do this? Where that they hard up for money??? This is one of IMDb's lowest rated movies. That alone should tell you something. Supposedly Danning was horrified when she saw the movie--I can understand why!

{"value":"This movie is probably the worst I have seen. Bad acting, bad script, bad everything. Comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting. Both Cyborg (Van Damme, 1989) and Nemesis (Olivier Gruner, 1993) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it's Albert Pyun who has directed these two as well!<br /><br />The story is not original. The world has become a terrible place, possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live under medieval circumstances. A special breed of robots (cyborgs) live on human blood and there's the story... The cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there \"prophecy\" and the humans need someone to stop them. One girl together with a robot (Kris Kristofferson) built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind.<br /><br />In this movie the director tries some Hong-Kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far. The movie fails miserably in this attempt.<br /><br />I recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new \"worst ever\" movie to relate to. And to fans of the genre I recommend \"Cyborg\" since I think it's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor. And if you can't stand Van Damme then check out \"Nemesis\".<br /><br />I rated this movie 1/10.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","probabl","the","wrong","i","have","see","bad","act","bad","script","bad","everyth","compar","it","to","mainli","two","other","movi","in","the","same","genr","and","from","approxim","the","same","time","be","interest","both","cyborg","van","damm","and","nemesi","olivi","gruner","be","much","well","and","seem","much","robust","in","both","stori","and","direct","and","still","it","albert","pyun","who","have","direct","thi","two","a","wellbr","br","the","stori","be","not","origin","the","world","have","becom","a","terribl","place","possibli","due","to","a","environment","disast","or","a","nuclear","war","and","peopl","live","under","mediev","circumst","a","special","bre","of","robot","cyborg","live","on","human","blood","and","there","the","stori","the","cyborg","ne","to","get","a","lot","of","human","to","fulfil","there","propheci","and","the","human","ne","someon","to","stop","them","on","girl","togeth","with","a","robot","kri","kristofferson","build","by","the","creator","of","the","cyborg","have","be","appoint","by","destini","to","save","mankindbr","br","in","thi","movi","the","director","try","some","hongkong","stylish","fight","scene","with","the","particip","fly","high","and","leap","far","the","movi","fail","miser","in","thi","attemptbr","br","i","recommend","thi","film","with","the","onli","reason","that","much","peopl","will","get","a","new","wrong","ever","movi","to","relat","to","and","to","fan","of","the","genr","i","recommend","cyborg","sinc","i","think","it","a","veri","underestim","movi","with","quit","a","high","entertain","factor","and","if","you","ca","not","stand","van","damm","then","check","out","nemesisbr","br","i","rate","thi","movi"],"filtered":["thi","movi","probabl","wrong","see","bad","act","bad","script","bad","everyth","compar","mainli","two","movi","genr","approxim","time","interest","cyborg","van","damm","nemesi","olivi","gruner","much","well","seem","much","robust","stori","direct","still","albert","pyun","direct","thi","two","wellbr","br","stori","origin","world","becom","terribl","place","possibli","due","environment","disast","nuclear","war","peopl","live","mediev","circumst","special","bre","robot","cyborg","live","human","blood","stori","cyborg","ne","get","lot","human","fulfil","propheci","human","ne","someon","stop","girl","togeth","robot","kri","kristofferson","build","creator","cyborg","appoint","destini","save","mankindbr","br","thi","movi","director","try","hongkong","stylish","fight","scene","particip","fly","high","leap","far","movi","fail","miser","thi","attemptbr","br","recommend","thi","film","onli","reason","much","peopl","get","new","wrong","ever","movi","relat","fan","genr","recommend","cyborg","sinc","think","veri","underestim","movi","quit","high","entertain","factor","ca","stand","van","damm","check","nemesisbr","br","rate","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["probabl","wrong","see","bad","act","bad","script","bad","everyth","compar","mainli","two","genr","approxim","time","interest","cyborg","van","damm","nemesi","olivi","gruner","well","seem","robust","stori","direct","still","albert","pyun","direct","two","wellbr","stori","origin","world","becom","terribl","place","possibli","due","environment","disast","nuclear","war","peopl","live","mediev","circumst","special","bre","robot","cyborg","live","human","blood","stori","cyborg","ne","get","lot","human","fulfil","propheci","human","ne","someon","stop","girl","togeth","robot","kri","kristofferson","build","creator","cyborg","appoint","destini","save","mankindbr","director","try","hongkong","stylish","fight","scene","particip","fly","high","leap","far","fail","miser","attemptbr","recommend","onli","reason","peopl","get","new","wrong","ever","relat","fan","genr","recommend","cyborg","sinc","think","veri","underestim","quit","high","entertain","factor","ca","stand","van","damm","check","nemesisbr","rate"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,9,11,12,15,17,19,20,21,23,25,35,36,44,47,58,60,64,69,72,77,81,84,87,95,101,102,110,115,116,120,139,140,148,162,164,165,166,189,193,195,202,203,211,215,233,270,292,298,314,315,354,377,467,477,482,505,558,568,652,818,903,1034,1154,1210,1330,1572,1859,2080,2088,2289,2366,2367,2540,2769,2897,3159,3256,3287,3473,3965,4080,4584,5091,5105,5207,5897,6455,7276,8302],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,9,11,12,15,17,19,20,21,23,25,35,36,44,47,58,60,64,69,72,77,81,84,87,95,101,102,110,115,116,120,139,140,148,162,164,165,166,189,193,195,202,203,211,215,233,270,292,298,314,315,354,377,467,477,482,505,558,568,652,818,903,1034,1154,1210,1330,1572,1859,2

{"value":"This has to be one of the top overrated anime shows ever made. And yes, I was even shown the \"End of Evangelion\" and that still made me hate it even more. Not to mention the countless rip-offs of this show!<br /><br />I don't mind psychological and philosophy untertones, but Evangelion drags it out into the mud like nothing else! Not many of the characters seemed to be very interesting. The only ones that seemed to be interesting were Asuka, Misato and Pen-Pen. Other than that, mostly everyone else were a bunch of whiny crybaby losers. They need to go to a psyciatric center, not piloting giant robots against aliens called \"Angels\".<br /><br />Even the mecha and alien fights did not help at all. Goes something like this:<br /><br />\"Well, there are these robots, and they are really cool because they bleed(!) when they get hurt, but they are not really mecha, but captured angels, so sometimes they go insane and don't do what the underaged pilots want, and they have to be controlled better...blah blah blah!\"<br /><br />I am so sorry, but I just cannot recommend Evangelion to anyone, anime otakus or not. To those who love this series greatly, fine you're entitled to that opinion, I respect you.

{"value":"Bollywood fans pretty much hold Amitabh Bachan's Mard in high regard but I think it is very overrated. Manmohan Desai collaborated before on movies like Suhaag,Parvarish,Amar Akbar Anthony,Naseeb,Desh Premee and Coolie and I have seen all of them I liked so I had very high expectations before I watched Mard and was bitterly disappointed. My main gripe about Mard is that it feels like Amar Akbar Anthony part 2,maybe Mr Desai ran out of ideas, after all he had been using that formula for years and years. 1. First of all some members of the cast is repeated from AAA, for instance the police inspector who brings up Amar, the Muslim who brings up Akbar, Nirupa Roy and a few more. 2. In AAA Nirupa Roy loses her eyesight, in Mard she loses her voice 3. In AAA there is the famous song (Shirdi wale sai baba)well in Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali. Having seen AAA for over 1000 times I noticed that straight away.<br /><br />My other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous, true Manmohan Desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with Mard I thought he went too far. My last gripe is that compared to songs in previous Manmohan Desai movies I found the songs rather disappointing. I know it has many fans that swear by it but I didn't like it one bit.
