{"value":"I had the displeasure of watching this movie with my girlfriend, who, like me, is a fan of the first. This movie down right sucked! It lacked the magic of the first. You could actually understand every word the mice said, the animation is crappy, the palace is much much different from the first movie, there's new characters that were never mentioned before and were terrible, luckily the Prince didn't have many lines which kept him from sounding stupid. Basically its like The Lion King 1 1/2 except its different stories all told by the mice. The reason I'm giving this a 2 out of 10 is because the songs not sung by the characters were the most enjoyable.","finished_norm":["i","have","the","displeasur","of","watch","thi","movi","with","my","girlfriend","who","like","me","be","a","fan","of","the","thi","movi","down","right","suck","it","lack","the","magic","of","the","you","can","actual","understand","everi","word","the","mous","sai","the","anim","be","crappi","the","palac","be","much","much","differ","from","the","movi","there","new","charact","that","be","never","mention","befor","and","be","terribl","luckili","the","princ","do","not","have","mani","line","which","keep","him","from","sound","stupid","basic","it","like","the","lion","king","except","it","differ","stori","all","tell","by","the","mous","the","reason","i","be","give","thi","a","out","of","be","becaus","the","song","not","sing","by","the","charact","be","the","much","enjoy"],"filtered":["displeasur","watch","thi","movi","girlfriend","like","fan","thi","movi","right","suck","lack","magic","actual","understand","everi","word","mous","sai","anim","crappi","palac","much","much","differ","movi","new","charact","never","mention","befor","terribl","luckili","princ","mani","line","keep","sound","stupid","basic","like","lion","king","except","differ","stori","tell","mous","reason","give","thi","becaus","song","sing","charact","much","enjoy"],"filtered2":["displeasur","watch","girlfriend","like","fan","right","suck","lack","magic","actual","understand","everi","word","mous","anim","crappi","palac","differ","new","charact","never","mention","befor","terribl","luckili","princ","mani","line","keep","sound","stupid","basic","like","lion","king","except","differ","stori","tell","mous","reason","give","becaus","song","sing","charact","enjoy"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,10,17,22,30,42,50,52,79,85,87,90,95,107,121,134,136,140,166,178,183,204,212,233,258,277,285,286,328,421,541,659,730,736,1022,1077,2547,2587,2787,2938,5392,6455],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,10,17,22,30,42,50,52,79,85,87,90,95,107,121,134,136,140,166,178,183,204,212,233,258,277,285,286,328,421,541,659,730,736,1022,1077,2547,2587,2787,2938,5392,6455],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.3364419891718522,1.6219954307453837,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,1.9469506069506084,2.011190219103739,2.115024371522662,2.0477128419653545,2.0323326556775485,2.1439533986393955,2.2190595059394194,2.2443961816702407,2.346825985579986,2.317169775997098,2.4423870329693536,2.532833256045391,2.4885128563647294,5.249049228095168,2.5983793339432615,2.6102777977348763,2.7061321952397077,3.1163992333432793,2.808171552082607,2.780700890737216,3.1550424959247185,3.2597778161886266,3.8023521382691974,3.8023521382691974,3.767137231978131,3.68099128126493,4.165705761027235,4.235066888824737,5.463272006538442,5.5623629091826725,11.043081829324834,5.3560264761848435,6.2980697041614135,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.135299441747927E-5,9.073697981953553E-5,9.144237331546286E-5,9.091401830827788E-5,9.091550783211011E-5,9.078842612055075E-5,9.105844362046898E-5,9.075004535173636E-5,9.095408453600235E-5,1.0090859180484996E-4,0.5254368416417625,9.060355477036372E-5,9.229462519011485E-5,0.15672254719534584,9.066962193733507E-5,9.041905022255862E-5,9.267444032540888E-5,9.106697510929826E-5,9.078444017377803E-5,9.08596843334835E-5,9.173880506968624E-5,9.115719943735981E-5,9.126099573805236E-5,9.135931922520773E-5,9.206045506469457E-5,9.157900480170776E-5,9.542881218903334E-5,9.063049037645624E-5,9.063291495431932E-5,9.086253293182553E-5,9.27937947981423E-5,9.106169855573553E-5,9.774701940637754E-5,9.131784167610839E-5,9.072913758947083E-5,9.114791236870953E-5,9.063822472630161E-5,9.06917852484358E-5,9.041859594993961E-5,9.04420547052634E-5,9.064562877871048E-5,9.160174808978534E-5,9.113628111378893E-5,9.07759537344124E-5,9.187897675668591E-5,9.081079404149856E-5,9.382798577868636E-5,9.244821789852181E-5,9.046453450013891E-5,9.066446665367019E-5,9.063302080083544E-5,9.318377469952078E-5,9.066581556808988E-5,9.043402551750572E-5,0.2681393230444766,9.068916867532548E-5,9.752623391287025E-5,9.061442901641622E-5,9.046348832969528E-5,9.089542493543625E-5,9.179703115868039E-5,9.088941168605504E-5,9.04467523821119E-5,9.065734379245256E-5,9.041968957886318E-5,9.251181378361169E-5,9.11986127597203E-5,9.100434636189015E-5,9.092475894801182E-5,9.125619414768818E-5,9.041639092518633E-5,9.09266651429899E-5,9.240143529043317E-5,9.057842211998525E-5,9.282019087310328E-5,9.081790226577396E-5,0.04274811130313485,9.096930562729856E-5,9.038804272365902E-5,9.050008491051837E-5]}}
{"value":"Bobby is a goofy kid who smiles far too much and wants sex. So he buys a van to aid in this quest. The acting is lame, the comedy is pathetic and the script is no more than a loosely strung chain of clichés and cheap thrills. The makers of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the out there craziness of other films of the time, but fell a long way short. They even resort to Bobby slipping on a banana skin, because this will supposedly add comedic value.<br /><br />I'm struggling to find a redeeming feature of the film. If you like DeVito, this is another classic DeVito kind of role - but he's only a supporting actor and there for cliché value.","finished_norm":["bobbi","be","a","goofi","kid","who","smile","far","too","much","and","want","sex","so","he","bui","a","van","to","aid","in","thi","quest","the","act","be","lame","the","comedi","be","pathet","and","the","script","be","no","much","than","a","loos","string","chain","of","cliché","and","cheap","thrill","the","maker","of","the","film","obvious","want","to","captur","some","of","the","out","there","crazi","of","other","film","of","the","time","but","fall","a","long","wai","short","thei","even","resort","to","bobbi","slip","on","a","banana","skin","becaus","thi","will","supposedli","add","comed","valuebr","br","i","be","struggl","to","find","a","redeem","featur","of","the","film","if","you","like","devito","thi","be","anoth","classic","devito","kind","of","role","but","he","onli","a","support","actor","and","there","for","cliché","valu"],"filtered":["bobbi","goofi","kid","smile","far","much","want","sex","bui","van","aid","thi","quest","act","lame","comedi","pathet","script","much","loos","string","chain","cliché","cheap","thrill","maker","film","obvious","want","captur","crazi","film","time","fall","long","wai","short","thei","even","resort","bobbi","slip","banana","skin","becaus","thi","supposedli","add","comed","valuebr","br","struggl","find","redeem","featur","film","like","devito","thi","anoth","classic","devito","kind","role","onli","support","actor","cliché","valu"],"filtered2":["bobbi","goofi","kid","smile","far","want","sex","bui","van","aid","quest","act","lame","comedi","pathet","script","loos","string","chain","cliché","cheap","thrill","maker","obvious","want","captur","crazi","time","fall","long","wai","short","even","resort","bobbi","slip","banana","skin","becaus","supposedli","add","comed","valuebr","struggl","find","redeem","featur","like","devito","anoth","classic","devito","kind","role","onli","support","actor","cliché","valu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,8,11,21,22,33,37,38,41,73,77,99,101,114,122,127,128,170,254,272,299,305,332,341,347,351,372,451,458,523,601,634,712,762,818,842,924,940,946,1218,1303,1617,1683,1729,1951,1987,2213,2299,2518,2747,2772,5168],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,8,11,21,22,33,37,38,41,73,77,99,101,114,122,127,128,170,254,272,299,305,332,341,347,351,372,451,458,523,601,634,712,762,818,842,924,940,946,1218,1303,1617,1683,1729,1951,1987,2213,2299,2518,2747,2772,5168],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.4018535447685214,2.975308642954861,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.4433074195966826,2.2489347673732487,2.4359679371086367,2.3409902041158843,2.4071371113909277,2.889652074525771,2.8028805344481915,2.7949961309240425,2.8612813773965557,2.9705344631698933,2.933776879434709,3.0151989841543516,3.0135689919434205,3.070535816550098,3.216957819005698,3.2850956241729166,6.9973394489419505,3.506637894120152,3.5119855004467477,3.7165362186843414,3.749984152751882,4.202455303235976,3.8883864756110005,3.969732115064953,3.952924996748572,3.9612932464190886,4.297765483040301,4.390138803171316,4.662879295624898,4.706176101378222,4.6973654716960676,4.900964426937307,4.869215728622727,5.129498826886393,5.089758498236879,5.2288713006995975,5.290429193699031,11.253802860640487,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.886850204024747E-5,6.840410563084862E-5,6.893588232545202E-5,0.02427523690481553,6.853869297389779E-5,6.844288957776818E-5,6.864644832110876E-5,6.841395537509365E-5,6.856777488662161E-5,7.60722032693558E-5,0.7465410446243776,6.83035201675072E-5,6.957837149991792E-5,7.057092225823928E-5,6.835332638187786E-5,6.816442727944177E-5,6.986470365122514E-5,6.865287997515132E-5,6.843988468246947E-5,6.849660917846694E-5,6.915935404633761E-5,6.872089760676601E-5,6.879914677409322E-5,6.8873270138291E-5,6.940183710317365E-5,6.903888503323647E-5,0.13514236564007484,6.83238261777805E-5,6.832565400013678E-5,6.849875665816349E-5,6.995468169520026E-5,6.864890212700176E-5,7.368878106669041E-5,6.884200135840055E-5,6.839819358997186E-5,6.871389634194302E-5,6.832965689073635E-5,6.837003469062563E-5,6.81640848158478E-5,6.81817697242537E-5,6.833523860156781E-5,6.905603057062537E-5,6.87051278597675E-5,6.84334869899746E-5,6.92650256137961E-5,6.845975213623441E-5,7.073432974185451E-5,6.969416080512616E-5,6.819871662138741E-5,6.834943995575844E-5,6.832573379490496E-5,7.024867678321021E-5,6.835045686512256E-5,6.817571674113041E-5,6.892404279933168E-5,6.836806212834965E-5,7.352233697466014E-5,6.831171796158312E-5,6.819792794235404E-5,6.852355303218731E-5,6.92032490883585E-5,6.851901980938582E-5,6.818531117321976E-5,6.834407022720793E-5,6.81

{"value":"Well I watched this last night and the one thing that didn't make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward. There was no beating around the bush that this kid was the Anti-Christ. However the movie was just poorly written. For example, they never explained how they made the dentist incident an \"Accident\" or at the end how the cop just miraculously ended up at the house in time to save the kid without the police even being called yet. The death scenes were just really bad and not entertaining at all. The kid they chose to play the Anti-Christ was boring and they really could've picked a better kid.

Save your money! You have to read the movie all the way through b\\c they knew the music would drowned out the speaking lines. I never got the part about the slaughterhouse or the need to continue to show cows and pigs being butchered. What did that have to do with the \"real\" BTK killer? I understand why there were no famous actors\\actresses in this movie. The script would have turned me away within the first page of reading.

{"value":"I really wanted to like this movie. I absolutely love kenny hotz, and spenny rice has a charming side to him. Not that I like spenny at all. Spenny ruins this movie. He should of let kenny and his hot girlfriend pitch the movie.<br /><br />Anyways, it's pretty boring aside from a scene with Roger Ebert in it. There really isn't too many celebrities in this movie, and most don't seem to say more than one line. Overall this movie was disappointing. I would only suggest watching it if you got it with the season 1 DVD of kenny vs spenny (it comes for free on the 3rd disc). Regardless of this production, I am still very excited to check out The Papel Chase.","finished_norm":["i","realli","want","to","like","thi","movi","i","absolut","love","kenni","hotz","and","spenni","rice","have","a","charm","side","to","him","not","that","i","like","spenni","at","all","spenni","ruin","thi","movi","he","should","of","let","kenni","and","hi","hot","girlfriend","pitch","the","moviebr","br","anywai","it","pretti","bore","asid","from","a","scene","with","roger","ebert","in","it","there","realli","be","not","too","mani","celebr","in","thi","movi","and","much","do","not","seem","to","sai","much","than","on","line","overal","thi","movi","be","disappoint","i","would","onli","suggest","watch","it","if","you","get","it","with","the","season","dvd","of","kenni","v","spenni","it","come","for","free","on","the","rd","disc","regardless","of","thi","product","i","be","still","veri","excit","to","check","out","the","papel","chase"],"filtered":["realli","want","like","thi","movi","absolut","love","kenni","hotz","spenni","rice","charm","side","like","spenni","spenni","ruin","thi","movi","let","kenni","hi","hot","girlfriend","pitch","moviebr","br","anywai","pretti","bore","asid","scene","roger","ebert","realli","mani","celebr","thi","movi","much","seem","sai","much","line","overal","thi","movi","disappoint","onli","suggest","watch","get","season","dvd","kenni","v","spenni","come","free","rd","disc","regardless","thi","product","still","veri","excit","check","papel","chase"],"filtered2":["realli","want","like","absolut","love","kenni","hotz","spenni","rice","charm","side","like","spenni","spenni","ruin","let","kenni","hot","girlfriend","pitch","moviebr","anywai","pretti","bore","asid","scene","roger","ebert","realli","mani","celebr","seem","line","overal","disappoint","onli","suggest","watch","get","season","dvd","kenni","v","spenni","come","free","rd","disc","regardless","product","still","veri","excit","check","papel","chase"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,11,13,15,19,34,35,37,50,54,64,78,107,108,124,187,190,222,247,386,412,425,465,504,524,530,646,666,686,710,730,797,817,936,1417,1479,1536,2187,2564,2895,3444,4565,5063,6467],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,11,13,15,19,34,35,37,50,54,64,78,107,108,124,187,190,222,247,386,412,425,465,504,524,530,646,666,686,710,730,797,817,936,1417,1479,1536,2187,2564,2895,3444,4565,5063,6467],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.717994385570355,1.8113893252729412,1.883428577602134,2.0064197866819473,2.1439533986393955,2.138507503627933,2.2323930368088845,2.4732161909892554,2.558331832813986,2.5771019354959765,2.7303758068497004,3.0433232530252132,3.107414446935464,3.226987993365636,3.2681460658591432,3.41740676039221,3.4028786598293,3.5784919978881358,3.5900195030592035,3.6621227969605474,3.6016814428070463,3.6528204042982337,3.767137231978131,3.7987743169213135,4.197121957260614,3.965503778955432,4.733083554298147,4.715065048795469,4.662879295624898,5.185068678041204,5.290429193699031,5.3560264761848435,5.719991853386255,6.214688095222362,6.437831646536572,21.10700594187658]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.670406163826402E-5,7.618682821869144E-5,0.10509959472818163,7.633547765530193E-5,7.633672832615916E-5,7.62300248349523E-5,7.645674360962636E-5,7.619779862413529E-5,7.636911905283451E-5,8.472736876317064E-5,0.566326500462355,7.6074798577397E-5,7.749469696757411E-5,7.86001758481935E-5,7.613027152691497E-5,7.591988030353389E-5,7.78136067497275E-5,7.646390702938288E-5,7.622667805569355E-5,7.628985641892914E-5,7.70280055246827E-5,7.653966341224733E-5,7.662681543060112E-5,7.670937222983189E-5,7.729807725249401E-5,7.689383006953761E-5,8.012630060885431E-5,7.6097414917487E-5,7.609945070154686E-5,7.629224822955564E-5,7.791382210546623E-5,7.645947659891594E-5,8.207277111508456E-5,7.667454582372439E-5,7.618024353143407E-5,7.653186557386522E-5,7.61039090236852E-5,7.614888083459689E-5,7.591949887591687E-5,7.59391958965322E-5,7.61101257973768E-5,7.691292635183993E-5,7.652209945180158E-5,7.621955246148241E-5,7.714569994497097E-5,7.624880594221694E-5,7.878217512687754E-5,7.762366027795007E-5,7.595807093815225E-5,7.61259429200804E-5,7.609953957501784E-5,7.824126668003943E-5,7.61270755289834E-5,7.59324542312305E-5,7.676592158413218E-5,7.614668384273674E-5,0.1509772383875902,7.608392908094317E-5,7.595719252663761E-5,7.631986582751672E-5,7.70768947542875E-5,7.631481683427765E-5,7.594314027620844E-5,7.611996224709469E-5,7.592041713569475E-5,7.767705822862458E-5,7.657443589071111E-5,0.17176132819193618,7.63444959770049E-5,7.662278380048757E-5,7.591764743847174E-5,7.634609650359983E-5,7.758437950694401E-5,7.605369607959651E-5,7.793598543107724E-5,7.625477432537105E-5,7

{"value":"First let me say that I am not a Dukes fan, but after this movie the series looked like Law and Order. The worst thing was the casting of Roscoe and Boss Hogg. Burt Reynolds is not Boss Hogg, and even worse was M.C. Gainey as Roscoe, If they ever watched the show Roscoe was not a hard ass cop. He was more a Barney Fife than the role he played in this movie.<br /><br />The movie is loaded with the usual errors, cars getting torn up, and continues like nothing happened. The worst example of this is when the the General gets together with Billy Prickett, and the General is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop, but goes on to win the race.","finished_norm":["let","me","sai","that","i","be","not","a","duke","fan","but","after","thi","movi","the","seri","look","like","law","and","order","the","wrong","thing","be","the","cast","of","rosco","and","boss","hogg","burt","reynold","be","not","boss","hogg","and","even","wrong","be","mc","gainei","a","rosco","if","thei","ever","watch","the","show","rosco","be","not","a","hard","ass","cop","he","be","much","a","barnei","fife","than","the","role","he","plai","in","thi","moviebr","br","the","movi","be","load","with","the","usual","error","car","get","tear","up","and","continu","like","noth","happen","the","wrong","exampl","of","thi","be","when","the","the","gener","get","togeth","with","billi","prickett","and","the","gener","be","run","into","a","dirt","hill","obvious","slow","to","a","near","stop","but","go","on","to","win","the","race"],"filtered":["let","sai","duke","fan","thi","movi","seri","look","like","law","order","wrong","thing","cast","rosco","boss","hogg","burt","reynold","boss","hogg","even","wrong","mc","gainei","rosco","thei","ever","watch","show","rosco","hard","ass","cop","much","barnei","fife","role","plai","thi","moviebr","br","movi","load","usual","error","car","get","tear","continu","like","noth","happen","wrong","exampl","thi","gener","get","togeth","billi","prickett","gener","run","dirt","hill","obvious","slow","near","stop","go","win","race"],"filtered2":["let","duke","fan","look","like","law","order","wrong","thing","cast","rosco","boss","hogg","burt","reynold","boss","hogg","even","wrong","mc","gainei","rosco","ever","watch","show","rosco","hard","ass","cop","barnei","fife","role","plai","moviebr","load","usual","error","car","get","tear","continu","like","noth","happen","wrong","exampl","gener","get","togeth","billi","prickett","gener","run","dirt","hill","obvious","slow","near","stop","go","win","race"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,6,7,16,25,28,29,40,44,49,92,94,124,128,137,140,171,225,265,270,284,307,315,341,390,433,439,465,476,489,555,1018,1029,1120,1123,1249,1284,1296,1661,1764,1913,2361,3278,3847,4131,6249,6690,7345],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,6,7,16,25,28,29,40,44,49,92,94,124,128,137,140,171,225,265,270,284,307,315,341,390,433,439,465,476,489,555,1018,1029,1120,1123,1249,1284,1296,1661,1764,1913,2361,3278,3847,4131,6249,6690,7345],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1966138720291084,3.838916364248105,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,2.0489535369135887,2.08112281984698,2.2323930368088845,2.3409902041158843,2.2939035841256437,2.317169775997098,2.373087554090762,5.282438985239508,2.73529586597515,2.731603554088023,3.110998680163279,2.8767855639325206,2.854312708080462,2.933776879434709,3.132778125427319,3.164467636384302,3.2872346624216657,3.2681460658591432,3.6105180246075443,3.3956930001684253,3.432149042129413,4.268777946167049,4.280272325592784,4.186539847930077,4.390138803171316,8.998179973919743,4.706176101378222,4.370968887063596,4.688631791727313,5.3560264761848435,4.890269137820559,5.339219357868463,5.7959777603641776,5.770002273960917,6.2980697041614135,19.982925593552345,6.600350576034347,13.897314540605125]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.342013566531122E-5,6.299247886410265E-5,6.348218532084667E-5,6.311538457776444E-5,6.311641865228075E-5,6.302819451207532E-5,6.321564919362153E-5,6.300154936945389E-5,6.314319981922516E-5,7.005393334796484E-5,0.37174084828983894,6.289985097846426E-5,6.407384550512523E-5,6.498787299058819E-5,6.294571689363281E-5,6.277176209065843E-5,6.433752517497826E-5,6.322157202277924E-5,6.302542734186166E-5,6.30776642153979E-5,6.368797761247576E-5,6.328420860259211E-5,6.33562672747074E-5,6.342452654671313E-5,6.391127720380553E-5,6.357703921643113E-5,6.624969716646751E-5,6.29185505274337E-5,6.292023374600785E-5,6.307964180238844E-5,6.442038482179425E-5,6.321790887254615E-5,0.13441094046911412,6.339573152135332E-5,6.298703454016128E-5,6.32777612260448E-5,6.292391995751756E-5,6.296110336460471E-5,6.277144672025038E-5,6.27877325295406E-5,6.292906008468294E-5,6.359282832574882E-5,6.326968644130757E-5,6.301953578746527E-5,6.378528922730175E-5,6.304372302966915E-5,6.513835288302942E-5,6.418047441714378E-5,6.280333871355048E-5,6.294213793279519E-5,6.292030722800431E-5,6.469112119349039E-5,6.294307439181378E-5,6.278215841366054E-5,6.347128245044119E-5,6.295928685686249E-5,6.770579360995373E-5,6.290740022372223E-5,6.28026124289674E-5,6.310247647074932E-5,6.37284000035185E-5,6.309830188299795E-5,6.2790993805265E-5,6.293719301744099E-5,6.277220595201002E-5,6.422462469033267E-5,6.331295903972011E-5,6.317809316713255E-5,6.312284106929382E-5,6.335293385893655E

{"value":"This movie pretty much sucked. I'm in the Army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible. If your in the Military and you see this movie you'll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad. It was ridiculous. They acted like a bunch of normal people with Army uniforms on not knowing what to do. It was a pretty gory movie I'd have to say the least. There was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump. I'd recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent, gory movie. It will be a better movie also if your not in the Military. I also would have to say I liked the first one better than this one.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","pretti","much","suck","i","be","in","the","armi","and","the","soldier","depict","in","thi","movi","be","horribl","if","your","in","the","militari","and","you","see","thi","movi","you","will","laugh","and","be","upset","the","entir","movi","becaus","of","the","wai","thei","act","a","a","squad","it","be","ridicul","thei","act","like","a","bunch","of","normal","peopl","with","armi","uniform","on","not","know","what","to","do","it","be","a","pretti","gori","movi","i","have","have","to","sai","the","littl","there","be","a","coupl","scene","where","thei","try","to","make","you","jump","i","have","recommend","see","it","if","you","be","bore","and","want","to","see","a","violent","gori","movi","it","will","be","a","well","movi","conjur","if","your","not","in","the","militari","i","conjur","would","have","to","sai","i","like","the","on","well","than","thi","on"],"filtered":["thi","movi","pretti","much","suck","armi","soldier","depict","thi","movi","horribl","militari","see","thi","movi","laugh","upset","entir","movi","becaus","wai","thei","act","squad","ridicul","thei","act","like","bunch","normal","peopl","armi","uniform","know","pretti","gori","movi","sai","littl","coupl","scene","thei","try","make","jump","recommend","see","bore","want","see","violent","gori","movi","well","movi","conjur","militari","conjur","sai","like","well","thi"],"filtered2":["pretti","suck","armi","soldier","depict","horribl","militari","see","laugh","upset","entir","becaus","wai","act","squad","ridicul","act","like","bunch","normal","peopl","armi","uniform","know","pretti","gori","littl","coupl","scene","try","make","jump","recommend","see","bore","want","see","violent","gori","well","conjur","militari","conjur","like","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,14,19,20,21,22,23,26,33,36,37,39,78,108,133,198,230,253,274,298,419,421,657,674,700,966,982,984,1011,1488,1826,2714,3564],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,14,19,20,21,22,23,26,33,36,37,39,78,108,133,198,230,253,274,298,419,421,657,674,700,966,982,984,1011,1488,1826,2714,3564],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.967100616408184,1.1175081997259209,1.312380678011735,2.330690080046114,2.324031090670098,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,3.1077880109725475,4.012839573363895,2.138507503627933,2.3212364753796515,2.5439726117360975,2.7121382192999195,2.7073305177318163,2.748952192422636,2.7819920465008363,3.1758963322079246,3.2597778161886266,4.00861390260916,3.6405503117064195,3.616452760127359,4.026392148630444,8.310898521720091,8.526159850104824,4.086456389373095,9.163067312341893,4.77960356993304,5.408212229355414,5.907203395474402]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0909360880619035E-4,1.0835796509800645E-4,1.0920034495199844E-4,1.0856938419551557E-4,1.0857116298264013E-4,1.0841940219345438E-4,1.0874185668654178E-4,1.0837356793694842E-4,1.0861723122452193E-4,1.205048888625758E-4,0.9181013619435197,1.081986291045657E-4,1.1021810286141884E-4,1.1179038831762518E-4,1.0827752641619151E-4,1.0797829405053093E-4,1.1067167752585818E-4,1.0875204497769535E-4,1.0841464218180159E-4,1.0850449864437514E-4,1.0955434330792744E-4,1.088597907348335E-4,1.0898374412131511E-4,1.091011618820857E-4,1.0993845724914748E-4,1.093635100677788E-4,1.1396094427089582E-4,1.0823079556492919E-4,1.0823369099217382E-4,1.0850790043623927E-4,1.108142104580371E-4,1.087457437253512E-4,1.167293438500589E-4,1.0905162945521194E-4,1.0834859991863492E-4,1.0884870013139187E-4,1.0824003191390473E-4,1.0830399380903934E-4,1.0797775155885122E-4,1.0800576596924567E-4,1.0824887382217742E-4,1.0939067006826179E-4,0.023787486853047844,1.0840450768864987E-4,1.0972173612613505E-4,1.0844611393107445E-4,1.1204923977461063E-4,1.1040152304324515E-4,1.0803261130654229E-4,1.0827136998417735E-4,1.082338173939245E-4,1.1127992387087648E-4,1.0827298085575253E-4,1.0799617752527782E-4,1.0918159012805489E-4,1.0830086910135866E-4,1.1646568214512677E-4,1.0821161511287861E-4,1.0803136197136886E-4,1.0854718001757802E-4,0.04969586117363367,1.0853999900419328E-4,1.0801137592788662E-4,1.0826286387400318E-4,1.0797905756887014E-4,1.1047746915375765E-4,1.0890924646223213E-4,1.0867725382155065E-4,1.0858221065136338E-4,1.0897801006930972E-4,1.0797511832160075E-4,1.0858448702654487E-4,1.1034565532288962E-4,1.0816861573120957E-4,1.1084573261113316E-4,1.084546025618342E-4,1.0930342266400402E-4,1.0863540822889996E-4,1.0794126494188945E-4,1.0807506555325381E-4]}}

{"value":"Lifetime did it again. Can we say stupid? I couldn't wait for it to end. The plot was senseless. The acting was terrible! Especially by the teenagers. The story has been played a thousand times! Are we just desperate to give actors a job? The previews were attractive and I was really looking for a good thriller.Once in awhile lifetime comes up with a good movie, this isn't one of them. Unless one has nothing else to do I would avoid this one at all cost. This was a waste of two hours of my life. Can I get them back? I would have rather scraped my face against a brick wall for two hours then soaked it in peroxide.

value.","finished_norm":["i","watch","thi","on","a","whim","becaus","it","be","avail","and","i","have","hear","the","thumb","movi","be","funni","thi","on","be","not","the","major","of","the","joke","be","base","around","geranium","physiqu","and","in","turn","kate","winslet","i","think","it","realli","pathet","of","the","the","thumbtan","creator","to","stoop","so","low","to","make","jab","at","a","respect","actress","just","becaus","she","heaven","forbid","doe","not","starv","herself","into","the","model","of","ideal","modern","beautybr","br","my","favorit","part","be","the","line","that","go","someth","like","hei","i","have","a","great","idea","let","swim","over","to","thi","makeshift","raft","that","no","on","els","seem","to","see","thirti","second","of","amus","out","of","a","minut","movi","doe","not","redeem","it","valu"],"filtered":["watch","thi","whim","becaus","avail","hear","thumb","movi","funni","thi","major","joke","base","around","geranium","physiqu","turn","kate","winslet","think","realli","pathet","thumbtan","creator","stoop","low","make","jab","respect","actress","becaus","heaven","forbid","doe","starv","model","ideal","modern","beautybr","br","favorit","part","line","go","someth","like","hei","great","idea","let","swim","thi","makeshift","raft","els","seem","see","thirti","second","amus","minut","movi","doe","redeem","valu"],"filtered2":["watch","whim","becaus","avail","hear","thumb","funni","major","joke","base","around","geranium","physiqu","turn","kate","winslet","think","realli","pathet","thumbtan","creator","stoop","low","make","jab","respect","actress","becaus","heaven","forbid","doe","starv","model","ideal","modern","beautybr","favorit","part","line","go","someth","like","hei","great","idea","let","swim","makeshift","raft","els","seem","see","thirti","second","amus","minut","doe","redeem","valu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,7,12,13,18,22,35,51,53,59,61,62,96,98,107,123,124,196,214,216,217,334,354,404,451,601,634,695,708,729,822,947,974,1102,1543,1586,1593,2066,2080,2350,2763,2866,2975,4314,5950,6185,7636,7844],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,7,12,13,18,22,35,51,53,59,61,62,96,98,107,123,124,196,214,216,217,334,354,404,451,601,634,695,708,729,822,947,974,1102,1543,1586,1593,2066,2080,2350,2763,2866,2975,4314,5950,6185,7636,7844],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.430631986809635,2.5958480334723544,1.463169012899134,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,2.0390708128715254,2.0881990796736947,2.1439533986393955,2.2619070973220485,2.2323930368088845,2.478925055209576,2.7303758068497004,2.6070186965339692,2.6113665294700725,2.942840385588056,3.0316467233633775,3.1419947805322432,3.216957819005698,3.506637894120152,3.5119855004467477,3.6284289511740746,3.6683728173057184,3.7952092507568174,3.813163054373413,3.9911462095687695,4.030886538218284,4.390138803171316,4.706176101378222,4.589376833631972,5.00274712124725,4.956227105612356,5.00274712124725,5.185068678041204,5.373120909544144,5.444579873526289,5.501738287366237,5.907203395474402,6.437831646536572,6.948657270302562,6.794506590475304,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.300268903503807E-5,7.251041483623932E-5,7.307411416934699E-5,7.26518911591919E-5,7.265308147863163E-5,7.255152698958433E-5,0.04739710776519327,7.25208558621785E-5,7.268390918314423E-5,0.14005078537289617,0.6395717925038237,7.240379121173435E-5,7.375517206987316E-5,7.48073058061185E-5,7.245658730097685E-5,7.225634855575076E-5,7.405869278519813E-5,7.2774123143506E-5,7.254834170994884E-5,7.260847138635089E-5,7.331100093273851E-5,7.284622388423019E-5,7.29291703613628E-5,7.300774336275608E-5,7.356804028556371E-5,7.318330014585859E-5,7.625978705615461E-5,7.242531619499387E-5,7.24272537418133E-5,7.261074777959092E-5,7.41540722252861E-5,7.276990650450721E-5,7.811233016856932E-5,7.297459751309736E-5,7.250414789462012E-5,7.283880233238016E-5,0.08189823307219612,7.247429861212314E-5,7.225598553401345E-5,7.227473207024876E-5,7.24374137083737E-5,7.320147493255003E-5,7.282950747684237E-5,7.254155996296864E-5,7.342301598098958E-5,7.256940181008393E-5,7.498052266664189E-5,7.387791222526031E-5,7.229269629227929E-5,7.245246757208702E-5,7.242733832667394E-5,7.446571588460768E-5,7.245354552668001E-5,7.226831572559783E-5,7.3061563914614E-5,7.24722076366239E-5,7.793589441155075E-5,7.241248112067628E-5,7.229186026871967E-5,7.263703268384222E-5,7.335753100102659E-5,7.26322273309639E-5,7.227848611295252E-5,7.244677549788819E-5,7.225685948294897E-5,7.392873344521843E-5,7.287931840853636E-5,7.272407478985495E-5,7.266047429965196E-5,7.292533327851221E-5,7

{"value":"honestly, i don't know what's funnier, this horrific remake, or the comments on this board. Masterpiece's review had me in tears, that's so funny. Anyway, this movie is the among the worst movies ever, and certainly the bottom of the barrel for sequels. The \"Omen\" name on the title made me stop and watch it this morning on HBO, but it's a slap in the face to the other three, especially the original. There are so many classically bad moments, but my favorite is the guy catching fire from the juggler at the psychic fair!! good times ! This movie is to the Omen series what \"Scary Movie\" is to the entire genre. Avoid unless you're looking for a good laugh.","finished_norm":["honestli","i","do","not","know","what","funni","thi","horrif","remak","or","the","comment","on","thi","board","masterpiec","review","have","me","in","tear","that","so","funni","anywai","thi","movi","be","the","among","the","wrong","movi","ever","and","certainli","the","bottom","of","the","barrel","for","sequel","the","omen","name","on","the","titl","make","me","stop","and","watch","it","thi","morn","on","hbo","but","it","a","slap","in","the","face","to","the","other","three","especi","the","origin","there","be","so","mani","classic","bad","moment","but","my","favorit","be","the","gui","catch","fire","from","the","juggler","at","the","psychic","fair","good","time","thi","movi","be","to","the","omen","seri","what","scari","movi","be","to","the","entir","genr","avoid","unless","you","re","look","for","a","good","laugh"],"filtered":["honestli","know","funni","thi","horrif","remak","comment","thi","board","masterpiec","review","tear","funni","anywai","thi","movi","among","wrong","movi","ever","certainli","bottom","barrel","sequel","omen","name","titl","make","stop","watch","thi","morn","hbo","slap","face","three","especi","origin","mani","classic","bad","moment","favorit","gui","catch","fire","juggler","psychic","fair","good","time","thi","movi","omen","seri","scari","movi","entir","genr","avoid","unless","re","look","good","laugh"],"filtered2":["honestli","know","funni","horrif","remak","comment","board","masterpiec","review","tear","funni","anywai","among","wrong","ever","certainli","bottom","barrel","sequel","omen","name","titl","make","stop","watch","morn","hbo","slap","face","three","especi","origin","mani","classic","bad","moment","favorit","gui","catch","fire","juggler","psychic","fair","good","time","omen","scari","entir","genr","avoid","unless","re","look","good","laugh"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,8,9,16,25,26,44,50,55,62,68,69,133,143,176,188,198,224,251,264,267,280,315,332,335,386,387,389,396,460,467,483,512,551,757,822,826,860,877,1120,1174,1333,1491,1695,2093,2439,2568,2891,3513],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,8,9,16,25,26,44,50,55,62,68,69,133,143,176,188,198,224,251,264,267,280,315,332,335,386,387,389,396,460,467,483,512,551,757,822,826,860,877,1120,1174,1333,1491,1695,2093,2439,2568,2891,3513],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1966138720291084,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.604729392502474,1.717994385570355,1.9536997889255368,4.045224089013853,2.0064197866819473,2.127032521151058,2.3212364753796515,2.3409902041158843,2.5040471493269134,2.5378812223426954,2.5439726117360975,2.689504733779216,2.6942272927333892,2.757740698455715,2.7085302779237206,2.8028805344481915,2.854312708080462,2.9705344631698933,2.908534262247101,3.0433232530252132,3.360519385990158,3.0914425013694116,3.291526514503207,3.216957819005698,3.342254038012865,3.613480989738201,3.369778711402955,3.528202072035993,3.7165362186843414,3.813163054373413,3.8204358137024927,3.8538340941043407,3.865219416329466,4.186539847930077,4.235066888824737,4.436351646326448,4.558366596889411,4.770124825978496,4.933754249760298,11.591955520728355,5.408212229355414,5.390512652256013,5.649374286172302]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.632868042299917E-5,7.581397828671809E-5,7.640335967554313E-5,7.596190024938559E-5,7.596314479959762E-5,7.585696350350464E-5,7.608257274150825E-5,7.5824895004208E-5,7.599537700963013E-5,8.431272236800965E-5,0.8494458143775174,7.570249690612846E-5,7.711544647023463E-5,7.821551525917447E-5,7.575769837715155E-5,7.554833678520623E-5,7.743279554309796E-5,7.608970110427878E-5,7.585363310301436E-5,7.591650227831044E-5,7.66510389637769E-5,7.616508674376334E-5,7.625181224975437E-5,7.63339650251178E-5,7.691978899034802E-5,7.651752014850635E-5,7.973417133362667E-5,7.572500256434519E-5,7.572702838550247E-5,7.59188823836796E-5,7.753252045594199E-5,7.608529235584976E-5,8.167111602794422E-5,7.629930905559955E-5,7.58074258241937E-5,7.615732706714196E-5,7.573146488910412E-5,7.577621661293473E-5,7.554795722425388E-5,7.556755784982339E-5,7.573765123859114E-5,7.65365229757099E-5,7.614760873940226E-5,7.584654238067515E-5,7.676815740055694E-5,7.587565269810235E-5,7.839662385346776E-5,7.724377864839751E-5,7.558634051907216E-5,7.575339095404127E-5,7.572711682403648E-5,7.785836255289263E-5,7.575451802008125E-5,7.55608491774879E-5,7.639023763311697E-5,7.577403037291037E-5,8.148664188472194E-5,7.571158272599758E-5,7.558546640640655E-5,7.594636482416318E-5,7.669968893488572E-5,7.594134054013999E-5,7.557148292614067E-5,0.03682954131233052,7.554887099016972E-5,7.729691527539257E-5,7.61996890495538E-5,7.603737255526198E-5,7.597087443641708E-5,7.62478003499938E-5,7.554611484753934

{"value":"Former brat pack actor and all round pretty boy Rob Lowe stars in a film set in a high security American prison . I had a gut feeling his character was going to be popular for all the wrong reasons like Tobias in the first series of OZ , but PROXIMITY isn`t that kind of film , it`s more like a \" Man on the run \" film like THE FUGITIVE . It also makes a nod to the themes of punishment and justice with James Coburn putting in a cameo as the spokesman for a justice for victims pressure group but any intelligent discussion on how society should treat criminals is completely ignored as the film degenerates into tired old cliches of shoot outs and car

{"value":"With Knightly and O'Tool as the leads, this film had good possibilities, and with McCallum as the bad guy after Knightly, maybe some tension. But they threw it all away on silly evening frill and then later on with maudlin war remnants. It was of course totally superficial, beautiful English country and seaside or not.The number one mistake was dumping Knightly so early on in the film, when she could easily have played someone a couple of years older, instead of choosing someone ten years older to play the part. They missed all the chances to have great conflict among the cast, and instead stupidly pulled at the easy and low-cost heartstring

{"value":"All internet buzz aside, this movie was god awful. I expected the movie to be more of a farce than anything. Instead the film makers tried to make a serious thriller/horror movie, and they completely missed. There were only a few good parts, and a couple good lines by Samuel Jackson. Other than that, it was a bunch of gore and some poorly animated snakes. All of the internet joking was miles better than the actual movie. Now that the movie has actually come out, hopefully this joke will die. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of over hyped trash.

{"value":"I began watching this movie with low expectations, as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a S.K. novel ( a novel i never read).<br /><br />I'm glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn't nothing close to good, but it manages to keep you interested. What really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors. The movie is overlong, hasn't no \"nice\" shots and no scares, the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap.<br /><br />The only things good are that, as i said, it keeps you interested ( i guess the book must be good) without using much horror cliches.<br /><br />My Vote

{"value":"Actually had to stop it. Don't get me wrong, love bad monster movies. But this one was way too boring, regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere. The actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts, was way too obvious a cliché. This film totally betrays the cover on the DVD which looks pretty interesting. From the cover one expects a giant monster, but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels. Moved on to watch another film called The Killer Rats but that's another review. Deep Shock was really crap, a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high

{"value":"I concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie. Very poor acting, offhand production values, utterly pedestrian direction, and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written, let alone produced. Even Hollywood \"professionals\" apparently go to work just for a paycheck, although no one should have been paid for this bad work. Careers should instead have ENDED over this inconsequential drivel.<br /><br />OTH, there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly bad.

{"value":"It is hard to make an unbiased judgment on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age. This is with out a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film. I was unfortunate enough to see this film for the first time in my youth, Iwill never forget it. I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made. I then saw it again earlier this year and was once again horrified.<br /><br />I am not a zealot or one to say what others should and should not see but I did take great offense to the way in which something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie. I love lowbrow cinema but this is just plain nasty. Rent some Rus Myer instead.","finished_norm":["it","be","hard","to","make","a","unbias","judgment","on","a","film","like","thi","that","have","such","a","impact","on","me","at","such","a","young","ag","thi","be","with","out","a","doubt","the","wrong","kind","of","exploit","film","i","be","unfortun","enough","to","see","thi","film","for","the","time","in","my","youth","iwil","never","forget","it","i","think","it","be","the","much","horribl","movi","ever","make","i","then","see","it","again","earli","thi","year","and","be","onc","again","horrifiedbr","br","i","be","not","a","zealot","or","on","to","sai","what","other","should","and","should","not","see","but","i","do","take","great","offens","to","the","wai","in","which","someth","a","horribl","a","rape","be","deal","with","in","thi","movi","i","love","lowbrow","cinema","but","thi","be","just","plain","nasti","rend","some","ru","myer","instead"],"filtered":["hard","make","unbias","judgment","film","like","thi","impact","young","ag","thi","doubt","wrong","kind","exploit","film","unfortun","enough","see","thi","film","time","youth","iwil","never","forget","think","much","horribl","movi","ever","make","see","earli","thi","year","onc","horrifiedbr","br","zealot","sai","see","take","great","offens","wai","someth","horribl","rape","deal","thi","movi","love","lowbrow","cinema","thi","plain","nasti","rend","ru","myer","instead"],"filtered2":["hard","make","unbias","judgment","like","impact","young","ag","doubt","wrong","kind","exploit","unfortun","enough","see","time","youth","iwil","never","forget","think","horribl","ever","make","see","earli","year","onc","horrifiedbr","zealot","see","take","great","offens","wai","someth","horribl","rape","deal","love","lowbrow","cinema","plain","nasti","rend","ru","myer","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,8,12,25,31,33,42,44,51,53,54,57,93,122,135,152,171,227,230,236,266,373,409,442,468,531,567,586,746,918,1052,1145,1640,1796,3039,4214,6100,8399],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,8,12,25,31,33,42,44,51,53,54,57,93,122,135,152,171,227,230,236,266,373,409,442,468,531,567,586,746,918,1052,1145,1640,1796,3039,4214,6100,8399],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.2796387880827016,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.7139899308309823,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,2.035389827120098,2.2489347673732487,2.366244071437088,2.3131195476980753,2.373087554090762,2.6005321873043625,5.424276438599839,2.617923930016232,2.747702973022204,3.0316467233633775,3.2209578243390444,3.257696649984802,3.304513710030018,3.424750734647968,3.454678155189441,3.4572130107926293,4.00861390260916,4.039936373738201,4.1302590120314875,4.2574141875167335,4.688631791727313,4.77960356993304,5.7446844659766265,5.9370563586240825,6.489124940924123,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0280871084482985E-4,1.0211544767288861E-4,1.0290929790644748E-4,1.0231468688681455E-4,1.0231636319776571E-4,1.0217334536873139E-4,1.0247722321366851E-4,1.0213015163011119E-4,1.0235977744183175E-4,1.1356258547162407E-4,0.8844956556910328,1.0196529104816897E-4,1.0386842264129356E-4,1.053501285139063E-4,1.020396430747096E-4,1.0175764952721163E-4,1.0429586680629252E-4,1.0248682455595312E-4,0.10747015591501835,1.0225353940129087E-4,1.0324290236790502E-4,1.0258836306505178E-4,1.0270517547971546E-4,1.0281582878697341E-4,1.0360488745160058E-4,1.030630630572367E-4,1.0739563843712063E-4,1.0199560439428153E-4,1.0199833301556029E-4,1.0225674521545303E-4,1.0443018839644435E-4,1.0248088631963205E-4,1.1000455013187223E-4,1.0276914993009413E-4,1.0210662202280192E-4,1.025779113928154E-4,1.0200430863590925E-4,1.0206458567737795E-4,1.0175713828855297E-4,1.0178353878487213E-4,1.020126411606178E-4,1.0308865836631811E-4,1.0256482157204358E-4,1.0215930893841819E-4,1.0340065166259725E-4,1.0219851823943571E-4,1.0559406750248864E-4,1.040412759609595E-4,1.0180883755855705E-4,1.0203384131559918E-4,1.0199845213528854E-4,1.0486907199486138E-4,1.020353593846391E-4,1.0177450273249354E-4,1.028916235505172E-4,1.0206164098454091E-4,1.0975607801439578E-4,1.0197752893073862E-4,1.0180766019775657E-4,1.0229376189465315E-4,1.0330843004091886E-4,1.0228699458044727E-4,1.017888255530163E-4,1.0202582524361402E-4,1.0175836905915323E-4,1.0411284680549302E-4,1.0263496964112334E-4,1.024163421287058E-4,1.023267744087588E-4,1.0269977176724282E-4,1.0175465675246638E-4,1.0232891964164979E-4,1.039886267877362E-4,1.0193700674942209E-4,1.0445989455392068E-4,1.0220651783899792E-4,1.0300643729714225E-4,1.0237690726646195E-4,1.01722753670664E-4,1.0184884601021671E-4]}}
{"value":"Living in the Middle East (in Israel), I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana. Having seen the trailer, and being a thriller-lover, I expected to see first of all a fast moving, breath catching movie, which wisely dips in global policy-making and the relation between oil, power and corruption, from a fresh angle. Well, I almost left the movie in the middle. The pace was painfully slow, almost all characters were stereotyped, the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult, but, as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review, in the end you don't care.

{"value":"It was a decent movie, I actually kind of enjoyed it. But the ending is so abrupt!! There is absolutely no closure and it leaves tons of loose ends. What happens after the concert? What happens with her boyfriend? Does she hook up with Grant? Does she come beck in the next semester? And what about Angela? Obviously Holly's performance would knock Angela down a few pegs, but nothing is shown to indicate how she reacts. There is so much left up in the air and it's very unsatisfying. I don't know if it is trying to leave room for a sequel or something, but it is a terrible ending and I think that it really makes the movie a joke. I was very disappointed.","finished_norm":["it","be","a","decent","movi","i","actual","kind","of","enjoi","it","but","the","end","be","so","abrupt","there","be","absolut","no","closur","and","it","leav","ton","of","loos","end","what","happen","after","the","concert","what","happen","with","her","boyfriend","doe","she","hook","up","with","grant","doe","she","come","beck","in","the","next","semest","and","what","about","angela","obvious","holli","perform","would","knock","angela","down","a","few","peg","but","noth","be","show","to","indic","how","she","react","there","be","so","much","leav","up","in","the","air","and","it","veri","unsatisfi","i","do","not","know","if","it","be","try","to","leav","room","for","a","sequel","or","someth","but","it","be","a","terribl","end","and","i","think","that","it","realli","make","the","movi","a","joke","i","be","veri","disappoint"],"filtered":["decent","movi","actual","kind","enjoi","end","abrupt","absolut","closur","leav","ton","loos","end","happen","concert","happen","boyfriend","doe","hook","grant","doe","come","beck","next","semest","angela","obvious","holli","perform","knock","angela","peg","noth","show","indic","react","much","leav","air","veri","unsatisfi","know","try","leav","room","sequel","someth","terribl","end","think","realli","make","movi","joke","veri","disappoint"],"filtered2":["decent","actual","kind","enjoi","end","abrupt","absolut","closur","leav","ton","loos","end","happen","concert","happen","boyfriend","doe","hook","grant","doe","come","beck","next","semest","angela","obvious","holli","perform","knock","angela","peg","noth","show","indic","react","leav","air","veri","unsatisfi","know","try","leav","room","sequel","someth","terribl","end","think","realli","make","joke","veri","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,12,13,15,18,24,26,28,34,36,49,52,53,74,94,105,122,166,187,200,214,222,297,309,341,387,513,679,940,1050,1066,1410,1419,1958,1972,2476,3012,3111,3179,4308,5391,6132,7710,7859],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,12,13,15,18,24,26,28,34,36,49,52,53,74,94,105,122,166,187,200,214,222,297,309,341,387,513,679,940,1050,1066,1410,1419,1958,1972,2476,3012,3111,3179,4308,5391,6132,7710,7859],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.4001215597131385,2.430631986809635,3.9631084698357775,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.6920303308087352,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,5.845900910402705,4.16224563969396,2.1765612129984904,2.2489347673732487,2.4423870329693536,2.4732161909892554,2.5308211829319704,2.7303758068497004,2.5771019354959765,2.813490713560207,2.848772527704847,2.933776879434709,3.360519385990158,3.454678155189441,3.6715125373103863,3.952924996748572,4.240607069200353,4.3095999406873045,4.443131333311827,4.436351646326448,4.869215728622727,4.9227044135737135,5.185068678041204,5.583416318380505,5.463272006538442,11.935656034581672,5.907203395474402,6.600350576034347,6.437831646536572,7.0356686472921925,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.633373107841259E-5,7.581899488438131E-5,7.64084152724696E-5,7.596692663501916E-5,7.596817126758287E-5,7.586198294549213E-5,7.608760711201949E-5,7.58299123242285E-5,7.600040561041506E-5,0.05647711041825446,0.5543661342977466,7.570750612708825E-5,7.712054918581958E-5,7.822069076611849E-5,7.5762711250783E-5,7.555333580541781E-5,7.743791925761547E-5,7.609473594647254E-5,7.585865232462982E-5,7.592152565996821E-5,7.66561109495985E-5,7.617012657421165E-5,7.625685781881421E-5,7.633901603021242E-5,7.69248787593118E-5,7.652258329941132E-5,7.973944732977712E-5,7.573001327450044E-5,7.573203922970596E-5,0.08417791143746907,7.753765076923952E-5,7.609032690631742E-5,8.16765201913858E-5,7.630435776751473E-5,7.581244198828161E-5,7.616236638413384E-5,7.573647602687027E-5,7.578123071191462E-5,7.555295621934998E-5,7.557255814188946E-5,7.574266278570695E-5,0.08591479150719233,7.615264741333408E-5,7.585156113309877E-5,7.677323713608497E-5,7.588067337675057E-5,7.840181134433573E-5,0.08241278161528118,7.559134205398416E-5,7.57584035426513E-5,7.573212767409192E-5,7.786351442710463E-5,7.575953068326905E-5,7.556584902564231E-5,7.63952923617602E-5,7.577904432722713E-5,8.149203384154179E-5,7.571659254816448E-5,7.559046788347868E-5,7.59513901818204E-5,7.670476413986738E-5,7.59463655653412E-5,7.557648347792836E-5,7.575245174461597E-5,7.555387004572957E-5,0.13100149762340704,7.620473116963064E-5,7.604240393488482E-5,7.597590141587104E-5,7.625284565358695E-5,7.555111372072572E-5,7.597749421505368E-5,7.720979873397227E-5,7.568650551306884E-5,7.755970708934642E-5,7.588661294429013E-5,7.648053962910712E-5,7.601312421583282E-5,7.552742622141886E-5,7.56210476534879E-5]}}
{"value":"Lynch. The man has some really great stuff! He knows how to disturb us, then reward us by getting us think in different ways. This, however, is altogether different. Dumbland's reward is 1% absurd comedy, earned by enduring 99% stupidity. I may have laughed once, but somewhere around episode 4 I just started watching on fast-forward. Didn't miss a thing. I felt relieved when it ended, and that's part of the point with this series. It's an annoying series about annoying characters in annoying situations, rounded out with annoying animation, voices and sound. But recognizing this and its other absurdist qualities still fails to make Dumbland worthwhile.","finished_norm":["lynch","the","man","have","some","realli","great","stuff","he","know","how","to","disturb","u","then","reward","u","by","get","u","think","in","differ","wai","thi","howev","be","altogeth","differ","dumbland","reward","be","absurd","comedi","earn","by","endur","stupid","i","mai","have","laugh","onc","but","somewher","around","episod","i","just","start","watch","on","fastforward","do","not","miss","a","thing","i","feel","reliev","when","it","end","and","that","part","of","the","point","with","thi","seri","it","a","annoi","seri","about","annoi","charact","in","annoi","situat","round","out","with","annoi","anim","voic","and","sound","but","recogn","thi","and","it","other","absurdist","qualiti","still","fail","to","make","dumbland","worthwhil"],"filtered":["lynch","man","realli","great","stuff","know","disturb","u","reward","u","get","u","think","differ","wai","thi","howev","altogeth","differ","dumbland","reward","absurd","comedi","earn","endur","stupid","mai","laugh","onc","somewher","around","episod","start","watch","fastforward","miss","thing","feel","reliev","end","part","point","thi","seri","annoi","seri","annoi","charact","annoi","situat","round","annoi","anim","voic","sound","recogn","thi","absurdist","qualiti","still","fail","make","dumbland","worthwhil"],"filtered2":["lynch","man","realli","great","stuff","know","disturb","u","reward","u","get","u","think","differ","wai","howev","altogeth","differ","dumbland","reward","absurd","comedi","earn","endur","stupid","mai","laugh","onc","somewher","around","start","watch","fastforward","miss","thing","feel","reliev","end","part","point","annoi","annoi","charact","annoi","situat","round","annoi","anim","voic","sound","recogn","absurdist","qualiti","still","fail","make","dumbland","worthwhil"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,10,12,13,24,26,29,33,43,45,46,51,61,64,66,71,98,112,113,127,133,136,178,204,215,236,255,271,277,319,361,428,473,804,839,928,1480,1568,1755,1807,2016,2059,2888,3092,3258,4409],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,10,12,13,24,26,29,33,43,45,46,51,61,64,66,71,98,112,113,127,133,136,178,204,215,236,255,271,277,319,361,428,473,804,839,928,1480,1568,1755,1807,2016,2059,2888,3092,3258,4409],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.6608112036218214,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,1.929723173391612,1.9214926742550966,2.0881990796736947,6.739988699036795,2.1521782565202803,2.4359679371086367,2.3212364753796515,2.346825985579986,2.532833256045391,5.249049228095168,2.605934685587711,2.617923930016232,2.6754694156628323,11.03096279382286,3.1163992333432793,2.9056060024680126,3.0399731661399314,3.3721070011625462,3.335489637924323,3.7740817043309423,3.965503778955432,4.017463517886143,4.5432147918688095,4.597282013139085,4.724033718778229,5.143104478942172,4.900964426937307,4.911775343041523,10.781025304512026,5.426230734858092,5.501738287366237,5.9370563586240825]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.957487033377973E-5,7.903827838003301E-5,7.965272562755497E-5,7.919249133031005E-5,7.91937888101197E-5,7.908309171930606E-5,7.931829591464586E-5,7.904965937566816E-5,7.922739182696336E-5,0.06044593302623234,0.9333443514722395,7.892205579691105E-5,8.039509683114386E-5,8.154195055313943E-5,7.89796049366912E-5,7.876133938513709E-5,8.072594247374763E-5,7.932572744025345E-5,7.907961967988777E-5,7.914516262448543E-5,7.991093849244851E-5,7.940431916296853E-5,7.94947330264812E-5,7.958037968525843E-5,8.019111821516978E-5,7.977174124243196E-5,8.312519370022948E-5,7.894551860046601E-5,7.89476305779693E-5,7.91476439535885E-5,8.082990859715804E-5,7.932113119173153E-5,8.514451490478653E-5,7.954424982862495E-5,7.903144724718942E-5,7.939622947430162E-5,7.89522557620663E-5,7.899891073633414E-5,7.87609436817999E-5,7.878137790429021E-5,7.895870521141536E-5,7.979155224273114E-5,7.938609783485151E-5,7.907222739552509E-5,8.00330378706746E-5,7.910257574848767E-5,8.173076153254262E-5,8.052888686105622E-5,7.880095938351544E-5,7.897511432276242E-5,7.894772277771436E-5,8.11696084645007E-5,7.897628932190419E-5,7.87743839181732E-5,7.96390455165038E-5,7.899663151749409E-5,8.495219524269496E-5,7.893152802850153E-5,7.880004809562685E-5,7.91762951974698E-5,7.996165750293411E-5,7.917105723518025E-5,7.878546991056185E-5,7.896890981067814E-5,7.87618963093557E-5,8.05842833408548E-5,7.94403930736043E-5,7.927117340526043E-5,7.920184718141903E-5,7.949055050424356E-5,7.875902295046599E-5,7.920350761104347E-5,8.048813592567343E-5,7.890016349433505E-5,8.085290143122695E-5,7.910876751076787E-5,7.972791239291094E-5,7.

{"value":"i have to say that this was the worst film of priyadarshan(releasing alongside much better kyonki which was also his directorial venture) ,it contains no specific storyline and just focuses on body showing by debuting actresses and some silly comedy sequences. I think priyadarshan is becoming too much repetitive in his comedy flicks just like govinda and David dhavan had done in the past after giving some good entertainers they also went on to loose their audiences.So it will be good for him to concentrate more on script and try some variations in his direction.Give us more of herapheri's and malamal weekly's rather than giving duds like garam masala!","finished_norm":["i","have","to","sai","that","thi","be","the","wrong","film","of","priyadarshanreleas","alongsid","much","well","kyonki","which","be","conjur","hi","directori","ventur","it","contain","no","specif","storylin","and","just","focu","on","bodi","show","by","debut","actress","and","some","silli","comedi","sequenc","i","think","priyadarshan","be","becom","too","much","repetit","in","hi","comedi","flick","just","like","govinda","and","david","dhavan","have","do","in","the","past","after","give","some","good","entertain","thei","conjur","go","on","to","loos","their","audiencesso","it","will","be","good","for","him","to","concentr","much","on","script","and","try","some","variat","in","hi","directiong","u","much","of","herapheri","and","malam","weekli","rather","than","give","dud","like","garam","masala"],"filtered":["sai","thi","wrong","film","priyadarshanreleas","alongsid","much","well","kyonki","conjur","hi","directori","ventur","contain","specif","storylin","focu","bodi","show","debut","actress","silli","comedi","sequenc","think","priyadarshan","becom","much","repetit","hi","comedi","flick","like","govinda","david","dhavan","past","give","good","entertain","thei","conjur","go","loos","audiencesso","good","concentr","much","script","try","variat","hi","directiong","u","much","herapheri","malam","weekli","rather","give","dud","like","garam","masala"],"filtered2":["wrong","priyadarshanreleas","alongsid","well","kyonki","conjur","directori","ventur","contain","specif","storylin","focu","bodi","show","debut","actress","silli","comedi","sequenc","think","priyadarshan","becom","repetit","comedi","flick","like","govinda","david","dhavan","past","give","good","entertain","conjur","go","loos","audiencesso","good","concentr","script","try","variat","directiong","u","herapheri","malam","weekli","rather","give","dud","like","garam","masala"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,12,20,25,28,30,36,39,77,112,115,127,160,195,257,349,354,376,385,440,515,619,675,711,940,1666,1835,2255,2506,2752,3115,3396,3776,3796,5128,6475],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,12,20,25,28,30,36,39,77,112,115,127,160,195,257,349,354,376,385,440,515,619,675,711,940,1666,1835,2255,2506,2752,3115,3396,3776,3796,5128,6475],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.357228929984541,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.5452294193519092,2.6728839783437044,1.4680183469605717,3.1077880109725475,1.9463902258768238,2.2466628996789315,2.201553588425805,4.871935874217273,2.3722295531801256,2.51289241584188,2.7602659523229094,3.0568369721919364,3.0316467233633775,3.1569204307489187,3.09496984188738,3.212973749990824,3.3956930001684253,3.5929222627171646,3.749984152751882,3.6375061693251913,3.952924996748572,4.688631791727313,4.828393734102471,5.051537285416681,5.156897801074508,5.3064295350454715,5.482320201509136,5.583416318380505,5.7446844659766265,5.770002273960917,6.794506590475304,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.463069779150468E-5,9.399258087344539E-5,9.472328356319127E-5,9.417597142164222E-5,9.417751438890365E-5,9.404587304405136E-5,9.432557864753062E-5,9.400611519092525E-5,9.421747520716798E-5,1.045291456130306E-4,0.4783893839069552,9.385436859494806E-5,9.5606113842666E-5,9.69699560647394E-5,9.392280622144814E-5,9.366324410892723E-5,9.599955657011939E-5,9.433441624225057E-5,9.404174408334387E-5,9.411968796885158E-5,9.503035115225708E-5,9.442787777765702E-5,9.453539824182293E-5,9.463724953042202E-5,9.536354180097485E-5,9.48648173242474E-5,9.885275402789421E-5,9.388227063818403E-5,9.388478220878438E-5,9.412263877359041E-5,9.612319342637487E-5,9.432895036837572E-5,1.0125413745272272E-4,9.459428378596033E-5,9.398445726777711E-5,9.441825749326002E-5,9.389028249294039E-5,0.5142154185930237,9.366277353721585E-5,9.36870739818785E-5,9.389795219934032E-5,9.48883766310285E-5,9.440620891426876E-5,9.403295315444157E-5,9.51755521348409E-5,9.406904351570293E-5,9.719449070308284E-5,9.576521738672515E-5,9.37103603414428E-5,9.391746596857922E-5,9.388489185302477E-5,9.652716562703922E-5,9.391886328142716E-5,9.367875671056131E-5,9.470701513008912E-5,9.394305428739688E-5,1.0102543027737433E-4,9.386563300394162E-5,9.370927663488538E-5,9.415671092714477E-5,9.509066636651274E-5,9.415048192514471E-5,9.369194020920919E-5,9.3910087542381E-5,9.366390640504161E-5,9.58310950628878E-5,9.447077699095405E-5,9.426954040422436E-5,9.418709743058401E-5,9.453042437260748E-5,9.366048939718977E-5,9.418907201896016E-5,9.571675624020046E-5,9.382833419664693E-5,9.615053658035073E-5,9.407640677979217E-5,9.481269591209585E-5,9.423324242421097E-5,9.363112407524528E-5,9.374718628417662E-5]}}

{"value":"How can anybody say that this movie is a comedy?? If I had not gone with then my finacee I would have fallen asleep and asked for my money back. I love Gwen Paltrow, but it was like she was on the wrong set. I like most chick flicks, but I hated this one. This is the only time I saw so much clevage and was not turned on. Those outfits were way overdone. No one talks that way anymore and I don't think they even did then. The dancing part was horrible.My ex said to me later...\"Didn't ya like that part? Didn't ya think it was sensous?\" I said yes only to spare her feelings. Now I know why we never married.This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.","finished_norm":["how","can","anybodi","sai","that","thi","movi","be","a","comedi","if","i","have","not","go","with","then","my","finace","i","would","have","fall","asleep","and","ask","for","my","monei","back","i","love","gwen","paltrow","but","it","be","like","she","be","on","the","wrong","set","i","like","much","chick","flick","but","i","hate","thi","on","thi","be","the","onli","time","i","see","so","much","clevag","and","be","not","turn","on","that","outfit","be","wai","overdo","no","on","talk","that","wai","anymor","and","i","do","not","think","thei","even","do","then","the","danc","part","be","horriblemi","ex","sai","to","me","laterdidnt","you","like","that","part","do","not","you","think","it","be","sensou","i","sai","ye","onli","to","spare","her","feel","now","i","know","why","we","never","marriedthi","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see"],"filtered":["anybodi","sai","thi","movi","comedi","go","finace","fall","asleep","ask","monei","back","love","gwen","paltrow","like","wrong","set","like","much","chick","flick","hate","thi","thi","onli","time","see","much","clevag","turn","outfit","wai","overdo","talk","wai","anymor","think","thei","even","danc","part","horriblemi","ex","sai","laterdidnt","like","part","think","sensou","sai","ye","onli","spare","feel","know","never","marriedthi","wrong","movi","ever","see"],"filtered2":["anybodi","comedi","go","finace","fall","asleep","ask","monei","back","love","gwen","paltrow","like","wrong","set","like","chick","flick","hate","onli","time","see","clevag","turn","outfit","wai","overdo","talk","wai","anymor","think","even","danc","part","horriblemi","ex","laterdidnt","like","part","think","sensou","ye","onli","spare","feel","know","never","marriedthi","wrong","ever","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,8,11,12,25,26,33,42,43,44,54,61,63,96,109,126,127,170,186,209,257,306,339,492,1042,1209,1346,1352,1942,1977,2098,3042,3345],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,8,11,12,25,26,33,42,43,44,54,61,63,96,109,126,127,170,186,209,257,306,339,492,1042,1209,1346,1352,1942,1977,2098,3042,3345],"values":[1.9381148836729736,1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.982619630677639,2.133457220525776,2.559277576165403,1.3324924169710188,2.803707089537043,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.8113893252729412,3.7637034094785053,1.8729627573220065,2.0390708128715254,2.125691139326857,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.4071371113909277,2.571852579609833,2.6026896854443837,2.7602659523229094,2.8739486825973213,3.003844442051426,3.6016814428070463,4.176068548062782,4.3095999406873045,4.416284083275639,4.436351646326448,4.85885294158718,4.900964426937307,4.933754249760298,5.501738287366237,5.878215858601149]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.11782315055382121,1.2000068985235141E-4,1.2093358078939819E-4,1.2023482527124846E-4,1.2023679518349123E-4,1.2006872817172744E-4,0.05532775026912779,1.2001796916758215E-4,1.2028781331400984E-4,1.3345276261888826E-4,0.8175289223449071,1.1982423370430631E-4,1.2206069360591029E-4,1.2380191622133067E-4,1.199116082855291E-4,1.1958022433721535E-4,1.2256300345071995E-4,1.2043711238369764E-4,1.2006345671169657E-4,1.2016296797039146E-4,1.213256151625027E-4,1.2055643508575787E-4,1.2069370687628914E-4,1.2082374080854918E-4,1.2175100094643303E-4,1.211142774870131E-4,1.262056916292577E-4,1.1985985635032254E-4,1.1986306288217702E-4,1.201667352741615E-4,1.2272085110107662E-4,1.2043013408147918E-4,1.2927154709254602E-4,1.2076888627718605E-4,1.1999031841372058E-4,1.2054415283163219E-4,1.198700851161339E-4,1.199409195170335E-4,1.1957962355649983E-4,1.1961064802775212E-4,1.1987987705982141E-4,1.211443557446788E-4,1.2052877036444961E-4,1.2005223329892384E-4,1.2151099381596001E-4,1.2009831000208634E-4,1.2408858045851384E-4,1.2226382171312507E-4,1.1964037781265533E-4,1.1990479036413255E-4,1.1986320286540082E-4,1.2323660396487088E-4,1.1990657431882485E-4,1.1960002933544177E-4,1.209128108182267E-4,1.1993745906927656E-4,1.2897955576130532E-4,1.1983861501863393E-4,1.1963899424032143E-4,1.2021023532377483E-4,1.214026198287435E-4,1.2020228273294102E-4,1.1961686075891913E-4,1.1989537029899992E-4,1.1958106989321427E-4,1.223479279958968E-4,1.2061120467652692E-4,1.2035428515153154E-4,1.202490298896972E-4,1.2068735671831346E-4,1.195767073861351E-4,1.2025155085427876E-4,1.2220195118079199E-4,1.1979099548776842E-4,1.2275576021102288E-4,1.2010771070969606E-4,1.2104773387946299E-4,1.2030794338070905E-4,1.1953921656655837E-4,1.1968739363551558E-4]}}
