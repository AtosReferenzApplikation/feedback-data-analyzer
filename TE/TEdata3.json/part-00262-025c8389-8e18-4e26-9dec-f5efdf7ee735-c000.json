{"value":"Curiosity led me to this \"masterpiece\". Unfortunately, I didn't rent it, I bought it! The most disturbing thing about this film is that it's not so disturbing. For reasons known only to them, the makers of this film set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer. Are you kidding me? The man gave new meaning to the term \"finger lickin' good\"! And with all the flash-backs and flash-forwards I had trouble following the story. All in all Jeremy Renner's performance wasn't too bad. You can catch him in \"S.W.A.T.\", in which he plays a disgruntled ex-cop. Anyway, I would rate this as a 1/10. It only got a 1 because of Renner's so-so performance. There are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering Dahmer's crimes.

{"value":"There is so much that is wrong with this film, but to sum it up: Terrible acting- so bad it must have been on purpose. poor script - they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story. ridiculously bad ending- in some cases the ending manages to save the film-not in this case. if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for. This is the worst film i have seen in a long time. It was complete torture sitting through this film, i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance. So do yourself a favor. Watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do. Even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture.","finished_norm":["there","be","so","much","that","be","wrong","with","thi","film","but","to","sum","it","up","terribl","act","so","bad","it","must","have","be","on","purpos","poor","script","thei","mai","have","have","some","good","idea","but","thi","be","not","the","well","wai","to","present","the","stori","ridicul","bad","end","in","some","case","the","end","manag","to","save","the","filmnot","in","thi","case","if","you","manag","to","sit","through","the","entir","film","you","will","want","to","kick","yourself","at","the","end","becaus","the","end","be","not","even","worth","wait","for","thi","be","the","wrong","film","i","have","see","in","a","long","time","it","be","complet","tortur","sit","through","thi","film","i","would","have","appreci","someon","warn","me","in","advanc","so","do","yourself","a","favor","watch","thi","film","onli","if","you","have","absolut","noth","well","to","do","even","then","you","will","regret","have","put","yourself","through","the","unspeak","tortur"],"filtered":["much","wrong","thi","film","sum","terribl","act","bad","must","purpos","poor","script","thei","mai","good","idea","thi","well","wai","present","stori","ridicul","bad","end","case","end","manag","save","filmnot","thi","case","manag","sit","entir","film","want","kick","end","becaus","end","even","worth","wait","thi","wrong","film","see","long","time","complet","tortur","sit","thi","film","appreci","someon","warn","advanc","favor","watch","thi","film","onli","absolut","noth","well","even","regret","put","unspeak","tortur"],"filtered2":["wrong","sum","terribl","act","bad","must","purpos","poor","script","mai","good","idea","well","wai","present","stori","ridicul","bad","end","case","end","manag","save","filmnot","case","manag","sit","entir","want","kick","end","becaus","end","even","worth","wait","wrong","see","long","time","complet","tortur","sit","appreci","someon","warn","advanc","favor","watch","onli","absolut","noth","well","even","regret","put","unspeak","tortur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,8,9,11,17,20,21,22,24,25,33,37,46,49,77,99,103,123,139,141,146,159,166,189,198,219,222,244,274,288,331,345,411,527,794,802,869,961,1110,1148,1678,1747,7318],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,8,9,11,17,20,21,22,24,25,33,37,46,49,77,99,103,123,139,141,146,159,166,189,198,219,222,244,274,288,331,345,411,527,794,802,869,961,1110,1148,1678,1747,7318],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,5.284144626447703,2.559277576165403,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,1.9463902258768238,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.2619070973220485,2.2939035841256437,2.2657547357741192,2.326138445979858,2.300267965194495,2.4423870329693536,2.498193474075453,2.5439726117360975,2.5792094178355414,2.5771019354959765,5.269016116063534,2.748952192422636,5.603124285389867,2.932274249550174,6.004465676314169,3.229006157521873,3.439602492783994,3.7465885637507435,7.776772951222001,3.9161110236258554,3.9954846111673676,4.1554492608600455,4.176068548062782,4.679973728984199,4.74221603786142,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.118807647961298E-4,2.1169300653874434E-4,2.1174527517734873E-4,2.1170270760391543E-4,2.1172274275403058E-4,2.1169183932737032E-4,2.1175767842838503E-4,2.1166034303434335E-4,2.1169305127789715E-4,2.1191181310725404E-4,2.1359327166514588E-4,2.1169340094007554E-4,2.1189388796841977E-4,2.1191596365579464E-4,2.1181969576676945E-4,2.117035414702399E-4,2.1177637567609516E-4,2.118760383584706E-4,2.1171447081128587E-4,2.1171369676217496E-4,2.1190416541618475E-4,2.1173490831315585E-4,2.1173522875559005E-4,2.1187086861014439E-4,2.117145471820265E-4,2.1191849657461973E-4,2.1176752792775869E-4,2.116925320907913E-4,2.117885044381764E-4,2.11853145342594E-4,2.117359469071497E-4,2.1184934806943348E-4,2.119533608105547E-4,2.1215008639459366E-4,2.1176716198751682E-4,2.11703413068686E-4,2.1177974410483183E-4,2.11724913527262E-4,2.1166056894252475E-4,2.1171440524675952E-4,2.1192657926066678E-4,2.1181032419177913E-4,2.118498308375969E-4,2.1167110326541518E-4,2.1171445908036948E-4,2.1170333346011964E-4,2.1177499311905094E-4,2.1181171516755458E-4,2.117686444521778E-4,2.1173507874789002E-4,2.1170385698619584E-4,2.1213760380898704E-4,2.1175712777489413E-4,2.1171441055568426E-4,2.117559937370445E-4,2.1169274868102948E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502653E-4,2.1170415419131475E-4,2.1169262784141E-4,2.118619870217944E-4,2.1177694030929717E-4,2.1169253934833314E-4,2.1167101702582126E-4,2.1164973116690375E-4,2.118410960276969E-4,2.1170291001284917E-4,2.1179914228165449E-4,2.1186

{"value":"Loved Part One, The Impossible Planet, but whoops, what a disappointment part two 'The Satan Pit' is. The cliffhanger of something apparently rising out of the pit was - nothing coming out of the pit. Then ages spent crawling round air vents to pad out the story, the Beast a roaring thing empty of intelligence, so no Doctor/villain confrontation I'd been anticipating. The TARDIS is somehow inside the pit despite the pit not being open till long after the TARDIS fell through the planet crust. And finally another ready made solution which existed for no logical reason - I mean, why not plunge the Beast into the Hole as soon as the pit opened?

{"value":"Sure, it had some of the makings of a good film. The storyline is good, if a bit bland and the acting was good enough though I didn't understand why Olivia d'Abo had such a pronounced Australian accent if her character was supposed to have been raised in the US. My biggest problem, however, was with the wardrobe. I know as rule, the average American is considered a frumpy dresser by any self-respecting European but this was beyond that. Anna's colour combinations were positively ghastly!! And that potato sack-like, sad excuse for a coat she wore throughout the film made me break out in hives. I suppose the idea was to be as realistic as possible (how many school teachers walk around in Prada?) but simple doesn't mean an absolute lack of taste.

{"value":"Wow, I love and respect pretty much anything that David Lynch has done. However, this movie is akin to a first filmmaker's attempt at making a pseudo art video. <br /><br />To give you a couple of examples: <br /><br />1. David Lynch is typically a visual filmmaker, however, this had little visual artistic content (blank walls, \"up shots\" with ceiling in the background) <br /><br />2. David Lynch typically takes great pride in audio, however, in this you could even hear the video camera's hum. <br /><br />In fact, it is very hard to swallow the idea that he had anything to do with this movie. unless...<br /><br />...this is a joke, on David's part, to force fans search his website (for hours) only to find this drivel.

{"value":"Visually cluttered, plot less, incredibly mind-numbing rubbish. Not even close to Greenaway's better work. Avoid at all costs!<br /><br />The overlapping 'split screen' effects do nothing more than confuse, the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the 'artistic' composing of images is pretentious in the extreme.<br /><br />There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film; even the nudity is incredibly unerotic, which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring.<br /><br />Plus, how anyone can say that the acting of Ewen MacGregor is brilliant is beyond me.

{"value":"I was about 7 when this DIRE MONSTROSITY of a film was released. In the UK it was advertised on the TV in the summer of 1977 for weeks, as if it were some incredible blockbuster film. It was actually the first film I ever saw at a cinema, and I was put off going for years to come. The following week I was invited to go and see the new film \"Star Wars\" and I declined. To this day I have never seen it, in protest at having to watch Sasquatch! Seriously, even at the age of 7 I could tell that I was watching garbage. It's just so bad, it's almost unbelievable. Rambling nonsense that should NEVER have made it to a cinema. I was however amused to read all these years later that the director never directed again, just as well as far as I'm concerned.

Scenes lack proper lighting, the sound is sometimes nearly inaudible, there's even video glitches like the picture rolling and so on.<br /><br />Like all bad sequels, it basically just repeats the story of the first one. Ethel kills everybody who shares her living space, often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wants.<br /><br />At least it is only an extra on the DVD for the first one, which also includes the same director's film Satan's Black Wedding. Too bad it doesn't include the Death Nurse movies though.","finished_norm":["the","movi","be","pretti","good","thi","on","be","pretti","badbr","br","recycl","a","lot","of","footag","includ","the","open","credit","and","end","titl","from","crimin","insan","the","new","footag","shoot","on","video","realli","stick","out","a","poorli","do","scene","lack","proper","light","the","sound","be","sometim","nearli","inaud","there","even","video","glitch","like","the","pictur","roll","and","so","onbr","br","like","all","bad","sequel","it","basic","just","repeat","the","stori","of","the","on","ethel","kill","everybodi","who","share","her","live","space","often","for","reason","have","to","do","with","them","get","in","the","wai","of","food","she","wantsbr","br","at","littl","it","be","onli","a","extra","on","the","dvd","for","the","on","which","conjur","includ","the","same","director","film","satan","black","wed","too","bad","it","doe","not","includ","the","death","nurs","movi","though"],"filtered":["movi","pretti","good","thi","pretti","badbr","br","recycl","lot","footag","includ","open","credit","end","titl","crimin","insan","new","footag","shoot","video","realli","stick","poorli","scene","lack","proper","light","sound","sometim","nearli","inaud","even","video","glitch","like","pictur","roll","onbr","br","like","bad","sequel","basic","repeat","stori","ethel","kill","everybodi","share","live","space","often","reason","get","wai","food","wantsbr","br","littl","onli","extra","dvd","conjur","includ","director","film","satan","black","wed","bad","doe","includ","death","nurs","movi","though"],"filtered2":["pretti","good","pretti","badbr","recycl","lot","footag","includ","open","credit","end","titl","crimin","insan","new","footag","shoot","video","realli","stick","poorli","scene","lack","proper","light","sound","sometim","nearli","inaud","even","video","glitch","like","pictur","roll","onbr","like","bad","sequel","basic","repeat","stori","ethel","kill","everybodi","share","live","space","often","reason","get","wai","food","wantsbr","littl","onli","extra","dvd","conjur","includ","director","satan","black","wed","bad","doe","includ","death","nurs","though"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,9,11,13,14,17,18,19,24,33,39,58,72,76,78,86,87,95,116,117,178,183,229,240,242,245,247,264,286,301,311,353,356,387,398,400,416,500,611,637,658,795,986,1001,1033,1124,1215,1285,1390,1497,1618,1629,1813,2083,2234,2577,5168],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,9,11,13,14,17,18,19,24,33,39,58,72,76,78,86,87,95,116,117,178,183,229,240,242,245,247,264,286,301,311,353,356,387,398,400,416,500,611,637,658,795,986,1001,1033,1124,1215,1285,1390,1497,1618,1629,1813,2083,2234,2577,5168],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.3210361566119257,1.4018535447685214,1.5538940054862738,1.865701314626681,1.9209463754160525,2.1337665533324026,4.012839573363895,2.031112399272319,2.115024371522662,2.0323326556775485,2.2466628996789315,2.2797301185117202,2.532833256045391,2.4885128563647294,2.8432628718938773,5.533214255322713,2.689504733779216,2.7502029743242886,2.7303758068497004,2.757740698455715,2.780700890737216,8.49292808370368,2.9203338091782562,3.0266839340212486,3.028335462059722,3.360519385990158,3.143848349181566,3.130944944345658,3.1401446412440817,3.3814747511661465,3.520060914452293,3.7432044657665027,7.626326108746826,3.784589681929357,4.039936373738201,4.035401218572811,4.2574141875167335,4.181290492043933,4.291900363587903,4.449957298382227,4.456830177669989,4.770124825978496,4.605250182788262,4.613282354485526,5.0768550934009715,4.9227044135737135,5.116075806554253,5.214056214914456,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.807155861912874E-4,1.805554449742292E-4,1.8060002550835134E-4,1.805637191263485E-4,1.805808073405664E-4,1.80554449445976E-4,1.8061060438644749E-4,1.8052758588871682E-4,1.8055548313277673E-4,1.807420676595342E-4,1.8217620353208632E-4,1.8055578136374448E-4,1.8072677909865373E-4,1.8074560771100256E-4,1.8066349970080484E-4,1.8056443034070426E-4,1.8062655148803246E-4,1.8071155495724402E-4,1.8057375210370482E-4,1.8057309190815118E-4,1.8073554485423886E-4,1.8059118348844744E-4,1.8059145679755312E-4,1.8070714561833998E-4,1.8057381724120408E-4,1.8074776806713822E-4,1.8061900513983685E-4,1.8055504031201254E-4,1.8063689625128358E-4,1.8069202923584214E-4,1.805920693174305E-4,1.8068879049708362E-4,1.8077750418235452E-4,1.8094529373735558E-4,1.8061869302511807E-4,1.8056432082551486E-4,1.8062942446035854E-4,1.8058265881848315E-4,1.8052777856845096E-4,1.805736961829523E-4,1.8075466188474548E-4,1.8065550657472027E-4

{"value":"This film is about a group of extra terrestrial gay black men exterminating females on Earth, in order to create a gay Universe.<br /><br />I watched it with the intent of seeing how bad it was. Still, I was shocked at how bad it was. It looked more like a film made 50 years ago. The acting, if any, is ultra bad. The sets and props are so ridiculously fake, making any college film look mega budget. And the special effects are laughably simple, indeed jaw dropping as others have commented, but jaw droppingly embarrassing.<br /><br />One has to be severely intoxicated, or in an altered state of consciousness in order to appreciate this film.

{"value":"I feel much less generous with this film than others of its ilk. The portrayal of madmen in this century is always done with them being so totally bizarre as to be a different species. Their antics are so outrageous as to be totally fictionalized. Everyone is Napoleon or some other historical figure; or they have a fascination with chickens. They are on the make or beating each other up. It's as if the scriptwriter said, what can I make up for them to do, without an sense of what insanity or even mental illness is. Watch the wonderful human portrayal in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" where the illnesses are believable and real. I once worked in a State Mental hospital. I didn't see any of these guys. These are too smart and calculating to make them come to life.","finished_norm":["i","feel","much","littl","gener","with","thi","film","than","other","of","it","ilk","the","portray","of","madman","in","thi","centuri","be","alwai","do","with","them","be","so","total","bizarr","a","to","be","a","differ","speci","their","antic","be","so","outrag","a","to","be","total","fiction","everyon","be","napoleon","or","some","other","histor","figur","or","thei","have","a","fascin","with","chicken","thei","be","on","the","make","or","beat","each","other","up","it","a","if","the","scriptwrit","sai","what","can","i","make","up","for","them","to","do","without","a","sens","of","what","insan","or","even","mental","ill","be","watch","the","wonder","human","portray","in","on","fly","over","the","cuckoo","nest","where","the","ill","be","believ","and","real","i","onc","work","in","a","state","mental","hospit","i","do","not","see","ani","of","thi","gui","thi","be","too","smart","and","calcul","to","make","them","come","to","life"],"filtered":["feel","much","littl","gener","thi","film","ilk","portray","madman","thi","centuri","alwai","total","bizarr","differ","speci","antic","outrag","total","fiction","everyon","napoleon","histor","figur","thei","fascin","chicken","thei","make","beat","scriptwrit","sai","make","without","sens","insan","even","mental","ill","watch","wonder","human","portray","fly","cuckoo","nest","ill","believ","real","onc","work","state","mental","hospit","see","ani","thi","gui","thi","smart","calcul","make","come","life"],"filtered2":["feel","littl","gener","ilk","portray","madman","centuri","alwai","total","bizarr","differ","speci","antic","outrag","total","fiction","everyon","napoleon","histor","figur","fascin","chicken","make","beat","scriptwrit","make","without","sens","insan","even","mental","ill","watch","wonder","human","portray","fly","cuckoo","nest","ill","believ","real","onc","work","state","mental","hospit","see","ani","gui","smart","calcul","make","come","life"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,14,27,34,43,48,55,75,80,91,125,173,175,184,197,204,225,236,246,292,415,498,652,678,823,911,916,953,1119,1143,1163,1257,1285,1422,1488,1739,2814,3076,3180,3442,4523,5020,5245,6464,7178],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,14,27,34,43,48,55,75,80,91,125,173,175,184,197,204,225,236,246,292,415,498,652,678,823,911,916,953,1119,1143,1163,1257,1285,1422,1488,1739,2814,3076,3180,3442,4523,5020,5245,6464,7178],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.1175081997259209,1.3002700588679295,1.3982850089458962,1.6608112036218214,1.6955116224012472,1.9536997889255368,1.9742250248702675,1.9951803900462557,2.0105926690411424,2.2242236634876535,2.4368824319140248,2.3791142619576227,4.992499677733764,2.558331832813986,2.624524614047584,2.641219492619754,2.617923930016232,2.673149229007135,2.9752256367457734,3.1588018988486244,3.386191741044285,3.7810747398219124,3.6715125373103863,3.850067611308864,7.939464230129906,4.100845126825194,4.1302590120314875,4.235066888824737,4.436351646326448,4.2860694432771105,4.34596758485818,4.449957298382227,8.96960805942479,9.086429583737619,4.751432692966343,5.322690055917252,5.604922523601468,5.7446844659766265,5.583416318380505,6.032366538428407,6.437831646536572,6.255510089742618,6.489124940924123,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.234407602816466E-4,2.2324275812784212E-4,2.2329787848933362E-4,2.232529884731E-4,2.2327411672029316E-4,2.232415272346222E-4,2.23310958448924E-4,2.2320831253640848E-4,2.2324280530791688E-4,2.2347350255652807E-4,2.2524672498634764E-4,2.2324317404730224E-4,2.2345459944065E-4,2.2347787955470622E-4,2.233763593891773E-4,2.232538678343091E-4,2.2333067579914003E-4,2.2343577597443485E-4,2.232653934689038E-4,2.2326457718847365E-4,2.234654376153402E-4,2.232869460197476E-4,2.2328728394518973E-4,2.2343032416998444E-4,2.232654740063531E-4,2.234805506669639E-4,2.233213453268011E-4,2.2324225779449925E-4,2.2334346629394172E-4,2.2341163393927875E-4,2.2328804127835604E-4,2.234076294908202E-4,2.2351731705956893E-4,2.2372477578809868E-4,2.2332095942123793E-4,2.2325373242729915E-4,2.2333422800586628E-4,2.2327640592866794E-4,2.2320855076990673E-4,2.232653243272447E-4,2.2348907433600583E-4,2.2336647651074383E-4,2.2340813859831555E-4,2.2321965983456367E-4,2.2326538109796075E-4,2.232536484753717E-4,2.2332921781121275E-4,2.233679433767196E-4,2.2332252276763826E-4,2.2328712575322467E-4,2.2325420056448943E-4,2.2371161216552582E-4,2.233103777523479E-4,2.2326532992581887E-4,2.2330918184256557E-4,2.2324248620167692E-4,0.9823555966838083,2.232773157576042E-4,2.2325451398481238E-4,2.232423587691727E-4,2.2342095801135587E-4,2.2333127123814583E-4,2.2324226544800506E-4,2.2321956888982666E-4,2.2319712169645186E-4,2.2339892722621744E-4,2.232532019252

{"value":"great mystery, but the film goes down hill from there. The beginning is promising with a car wreck and a woman and her daughter being burned alive in front of a police officer, Edward. He is traumatized over this and is seen popping pills. A mysterious letter turns up from an old girlfriend asking for help in finding her missing daughter. So Ed travels to an island commune of mainly woman. They don't like outsiders. A lot of filler is with Ed shown looking around town for the girl. That made the movie too long. It finally gets a little better toward the end when we learn of the crazy rituals the woman perform and finally of the sinister plan in store for Edward.<br /><br />Overall, not a well written story and too long. <br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: I would skip

{"value":"Visually disjointed and full of itself, the director apparently chose to seek faux-depth to expand a 5 minute plot into an 81 minute snore-fest. <br /><br />The moments that work in this film are VERY limited, and the characters don't even feel real. How could you feel invested in a main protagonist who was made so surreal? <br /><br />Substantively AND stylistically, it all feels like a quirky dream sequence. Jarring irregular camera work, awkward silences and gaps in action, and what's with the little spider image crawling across the screen? Whoever thought of that needs to go back to film school. It added no meaning, just cheese, and didn't even stylistically work with the rest of the film (assuming the film even had a style, which is a close call).

I feel compelled to write this report to warn others not to waste their time watching this crap. If this was a student project, i would have to say not bad, but only for the first 15 min... after that it gets annoying. the screaming, the bad audio, the bad video (a good camera man could have made it much better). and yes, whats with the Blair-Witch effect? no budget?

somewhere in this movie, but I was unable to tell exactly what it was after I gouched my eyeballs out and threw them at Richard Gere.","finished_norm":["if","the","onli","sex","you","have","ever","have","be","with","a","farm","anim","then","the","tag","line","for","thi","movi","be","probabl","still","misleadingbr","br","thi","be","by","far","on","of","the","much","bore","movi","i","have","have","the","pleasur","to","try","and","watch","late","i","find","the","dvd","lie","around","at","my","friend","hous","and","i","make","the","sad","mistak","of","not","burn","itbr","br","i","be","unabl","to","tell","ani","detail","without","spoil","the","movi","becaus","there","be","onli","about","detail","to","thi","movi","just","try","to","imagin","someon","make","a","movi","about","thing","on","cspan","onli","the","fiction","movi","be","time","littl","interest","than","the","much","bore","debat","on","cspanbr","br","i","think","there","be","a","conspiraci","somewher","in","thi","movi","but","i","be","unabl","to","tell","exactli","what","it","be","after","i","gouch","my","eyebal","out","and","throw","them","at","richard","gere"],"filtered":["onli","sex","ever","farm","anim","tag","line","thi","movi","probabl","still","misleadingbr","br","thi","far","much","bore","movi","pleasur","try","watch","late","find","dvd","lie","around","friend","hous","make","sad","mistak","burn","itbr","br","unabl","tell","ani","detail","without","spoil","movi","becaus","onli","detail","thi","movi","try","imagin","someon","make","movi","thing","cspan","onli","fiction","movi","time","littl","interest","much","bore","debat","cspanbr","br","think","conspiraci","somewher","thi","movi","unabl","tell","exactli","gouch","eyebal","throw","richard","gere"],"filtered2":["onli","sex","ever","farm","anim","tag","line","probabl","still","misleadingbr","far","bore","pleasur","try","watch","late","find","dvd","lie","around","friend","hous","make","sad","mistak","burn","itbr","unabl","tell","ani","detail","without","spoil","becaus","onli","detail","try","imagin","someon","make","thing","cspan","onli","fiction","time","littl","interest","bore","debat","cspanbr","think","conspiraci","somewher","unabl","tell","exactli","gouch","eyebal","throw","richard","gere"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,11,12,14,22,27,29,36,38,44,60,64,90,98,101,107,108,125,139,148,150,161,213,247,254,277,310,340,430,455,462,592,641,650,740,804,862,916,1193,1502,1638,2128,2656,2853,3354,3966,5077],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,8,11,12,14,22,27,29,36,38,44,60,64,90,98,101,107,108,125,139,148,150,161,213,247,254,277,310,340,430,455,462,592,641,650,740,804,862,916,1193,1502,1638,2128,2656,2853,3354,3966,5077],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.9739294460164585,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2979240167361772,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,2.9360366939211433,1.519311641348122,1.604729392502474,1.838176641236591,1.883428577602134,4.095425683930709,2.0881990796736947,2.098582041218749,2.1439533986393955,4.277015007255866,2.2242236634876535,2.2939035841256437,2.3018654096236517,2.332712011146513,2.4323182980210873,2.8432628718938773,2.7303758068497004,2.889652074525771,3.1163992333432793,2.854312708080462,2.948928684455311,3.1419947805322432,3.2787058260741455,3.2639531875991072,3.5227672760500357,3.7034641371169887,3.6621227969605474,7.433072437368683,3.7740817043309423,3.944626193933877,4.100845126825194,4.240607069200353,9.041818068709022,4.589376833631972,5.185068678041204,5.290429193699031,5.444579873526289,5.583416318380505,5.7959777603641776,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612976E-4,2.1169300653874429E-4,2.1174527517734868E-4,2.1170270760391538E-4,2.1172274275403053E-4,2.1169183932737026E-4,2.1175767842838498E-4,2.116603430343433E-4,2.116930512778971E-4,2.1191181310725398E-4,2.1359327166514582E-4,2.1169340094007549E-4,2.118938879684197E-4,2.1191596365579459E-4,2.1181969576676942E-4,2.1170354147023986E-4,2.1177637567609513E-4,2.1187603835847054E-4,2.1171447081128582E-4,2.117136967621749E-4,2.119041654161847E-4,2.117349083131558E-4,2.1173522875559E-4,2.1187086861014433E-4,2.1171454718202644E-4,2.1191849657461968E-4,2.1176752792775863E-4,2.1169253209079125E-4,2.1178850443817634E-4,2.1185314534259394E-4,2.1173594690714965E-4,2.1184934806943342E-4,2.1195336081055463E-4,2.121500863945936E-4,2.1176716198751676E-4,2.1170341306868593E-4,2.1177974410483178E-4,2.1172491352726194E-4,2.1166056894252473E-4,2.1171440524675946E-4,2.1192657926066673E-4,2.1181032419177907E-4,2.1184983083759687E-4,2.1167110326541513E-4,2.1171445908036942E-4,2.1170333346011959E-4,2.1177499311905089E-4,2.1181171516755453E-4,2.1176864445217775E-4,2.1173507874788997E-4,2.1170385698619578E-4,2.12137603808987E-4,2.1175712777489407E-4,2.117144105556842E-4,2.1175599373704447E-4,2.1169274868102942E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.11725776285

{"value":"How did this ripoff of \"Being There\" ever get to be so loved? People say it's proof that a decent, honest man can succeed despite lack of intelligence. They're wrong. The movie is proof that luck is everything: hope your friend invests all your money in Apple and not Atari; hope your shrimp boat is the only one out at sea when a storm breaks; hope that you don't die of shock when you're luckily shot in the buttocks and not in the back; hope you don't get AIDS from your wife. This movie is also politically reactionary -- all who rebel against societal convention lose their legs, do drugs, beat their girlfriends, or die young. In addition, the product placement in this film (Nike and Dr. Pepper) is shameless.

{"value":"The premise sucked me in, but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either David Lynch or something seriously terrible. Interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list. I can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece (Romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one. The message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 (or simply get a lobotomy - Jennifer what happened to ya?) and blindly follow the Bible without any sort of self-examination whatsoever or we'll trigger the second coming. It's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings (I work around the corner from the site of the former WTC).

{"value":"Ben Masters,(Kyd Thomas),\"Dream Lover\",'86 plays a sort of Mike Hammer character, a private eye who does any old job for a buck and never misses out on all the sexy curves of good looking gals. Kyd makes one big mistake when he stops Morgan Fairchild,(Laura Cassidy/Eva Bomberg),\"Arizona Summer\",'73 from getting beaten up and raped. Kyd takes Laura home to his pad and when he wakes up, she is out on his patio eating his eggs and orange juice and making herself right at home. By the way, Kyd sleep in his bed and Laura slept on the couch for this particular scene. Laura is mixed up with all kinds of hoods and there are some hot scenes between Kyd and Laura.

{"value":"From the blocky digitised footage to the acting that makes Keanu \"I'm so wooden I could be a Plank me\" Reeves look like an Oscar winner this film bites (pun not intended). The best thing about it is the box of eRATicate in the 2nd segment (which out of the three seemed to be the strongest piece in terms of storyline and 'twist'). Wish I'd spent the £3.99 it cost me on something else, like erm.... Natural Born Killers: Directors Cut. If you do buy this, you're really in for a disappointment, do yourself a favour and avoid it like the plague. If you're looking for something amateurish and with actors that are more wooden than a 2x4 then go ahead.

{"value":"I felt that the movie was dry... very disappointing no plot..kept waited for something to happened and nothing did dry as a bone.. a wast of money.. One of Robins Williams worst films..if you don't believe me wait a few months it will be out on DVD because that seems to be a pattern for movies that don't do well in the theaters are out as rentals before the year is over... This is one you will not want to see or say why did I spend my money on that!. Plus for it being such a new movie there were only 8 people in the watching it.... This was on a Friday night the 9:50 showing. I also felt that it needed some more excitement or something to keep us awake. When they characters spoke in the movie the voices were also very low you could not hear what they were

{"value":"I gave Timecop a perfect 10, I gave this 1<br /><br />It's story is very boring, and it has only little to do with the original Timecop. Lots of things from Timecop was scrapped, and they put in new stupid stuff instead. This story is taking place in 2060 (if I remember correctly), but for some reason the timetraveling is now more dangerous :confused:<br /><br />And the action scenes are nothing to be happy about, well most of them aren't... only the first one is great... and there aren't many action scenes at all, and they're all pretty short<br /><br />At one point in the story, the main character travels

{"value":"Lois Weber, self proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial subjects, but this may be the first to get wide viewing, thanks to TCM. This film is her indictment of abortion, but she cleverly muddles the issue by bringing in eugenics and birth control, leaving the impression that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. Her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here, but one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them less didactically. If you have wondered what Tyrone Power, Jr.'s \"famous father\" looked like, here is your chance. 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece.

{"value":"This sleek, sexy movie is a must-see. Only upon multiple viewings can one truly understand the uniqueness of this film. Personally I enjoy the narrator for his intelligent, no subject left untouched, style of narration. The introduction grips you right away, and holds you at the edge of your seat throughout the film. He provides wonderful insight into the world of the trainables and allows the audience to really 'connect' with internal horror this film exhibits. The script itself holds the movie together wonderfully. Not only for kids, but the elderly alike will gain a higher understanding of the trainables and the modern grasp that they have on the sexual experience.

{"value":"This movie should have been named Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. This applies perfectly to Redline. The only thing about this movie that was A-Level were the cars. The acting seemed forced and scripted, the premise was flimsy at best, and the plot was almost nonexistent. I only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and, while it was pretty bad, it could have been worse. And at least it was entertaining. I just wish they had showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, don't pay for it, don't go out of your way to see it, but if it's on Showtime or HBO and there isn't anything else on, it's a decent

{"value":"I was in such high hopes of seeing an adaptation of a classic story like the Arabian Nights. Instead i was disappointed in a film that failed to keep my attention from the very beginning, even though i tried watching it twice!! <br /><br />It was a bonus that Caradine was in this movie but it didn't amount to much as the actors lacked likability. For something a little similar Zorro with Anthony Hopkins and Bandaras is much better for action, comic moments and overall enjoyability.<br /><br />OK, so Son of the Dragon has many possible fans out there, but if your looking for something to wow about in terms of martial arts and plot line you wont get it.

{"value":"When i saw the preview for this on TV i was thinking, \"ok its gonna be a good werewolf movie\" but it was not. it was not scary at all! acting was good, plot was horrible, the military bid was just plain stupid. I think the SCI-FI channel could of done better than this piece of crap. The movie made it sound like Arron was going to turn into a werewolf, instead he turned psycho and bit some doctor's throat out. If you have read some of my other reviews on other movies, there all positive, but this one is not simply because the story was terrible. One out of 10 max. Im sure you all were expecting some werewolf flick, but i bet you didn't expect this.

{"value":"Below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music??? Ordinary Script & Direction with full of blunders. Salman Khan was at his usual acting. Ajay's performance deteriorating with time as his looks,especially his styles as a Rock Star were pathetic. Asin was just a showpiece only. Overall I felt like wasting my money in cinema. Salman Khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to Aamir Khan. There were many songs in the movie all boring except \"Man Ko Ati\". The Most Important Song to impress the UK Music Sponsor was most unimpressive. \"Khanabadosh\" can be very easily understood by an English Music Sponsor.

{"value":"IT SHOULD FIRST BE SAID THAT I HAVE READ THE MANGA AND THEREFORE MY ARGUMENT IS BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES.<br /><br />This anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and OVA. What it left behind was merely a husk of what it could have been. Many of the characters lacked the depth that is seen in the manga. Alucard is not the sympathetic character that secretly wishes for death. Walter's story lacks the betrayal. And the Nazi villains that plot to engulf the world in war are completely absent. Instead, the anime provides the Gary Stu villain Incognito who is defeated against what appear to be all odds.<br /><br />My primary complaint is not that the anime diverges from the manga, but that

{"value":"This film is deeply disappointing. Not only that Wenders only displays a very limited musical spectrum of Blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely boring. The only highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. Wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world's culture (or actually, American culture) traveling in space, but his limited looks on the theme as well as the neither funny nor utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie as a mere sleeping aid.
