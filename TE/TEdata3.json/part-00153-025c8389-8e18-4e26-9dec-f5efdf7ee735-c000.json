{"value":"Hee hee hee. This movie is so bad that it doesn't even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time. I remember the day I first saw this on MST. Sun was shining, looked like a good day. then, I saw this product of Rick Sloane which consisted of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the crappy 80s fest land. Kevin, wussy extraordinaire, tries to impress his girlfriend, manages an assistant security guard job, fights with rakes, and plenty more stuff in this very badly made series of images. No plot or story is needed. Obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves. An army guy and his sex crazed girl will make you wanna leap off a cliff, and the dorky friend who gets his kicks off phone sex will make you say, \" He has got some nice red shorts\". Plus, I really hated the old security guard and wished he had an accident in his supermarket cart. Just when you think it's over, wait until the Club Scum scene. Ask for Road Rash.<br /><br />I advise that after viewing this film, a good month to regain senses and sanity. And if you see Rick Sloane, give him a good kick to the groin to show how much we appreciate this crapsterpiece called Hobgoblins.","finished_norm":["hee","hee","hee","thi","movi","be","so","bad","that","it","doe","not","even","try","to","hide","the","fact","that","it","suck","big","time","i","rememb","the","dai","i","see","thi","on","mst","sun","be","shine","look","like","a","good","dai","then","i","see","thi","product","of","rick","sloan","which","consist","of","horribl","plush","doll","wreak","havoc","in","the","crappi","fest","land","kevin","wussi","extraordinair","try","to","impress","hi","girlfriend","manag","a","assist","secur","guard","job","fight","with","rake","and","plenti","much","stuff","in","thi","veri","badli","make","seri","of","imag","no","plot","or","stori","be","ne","obvious","no","act","be","necessari","a","the","film","prove","a","armi","gui","and","hi","sex","craze","girl","will","make","you","wanna","leap","off","a","cliff","and","the","dorki","friend","who","get","hi","kick","off","phone","sex","will","make","you","sai","he","have","get","some","nice","red","short","plu","i","realli","hate","the","old","secur","guard","and","wish","he","have","a","accid","in","hi","supermarket","cart","just","when","you","think","it","over","wait","until","the","club","scum","scene","ask","for","road","rashbr","br","i","advis","that","after","view","thi","film","a","good","month","to","regain","sens","and","saniti","and","if","you","see","rick","sloan","give","him","a","good","kick","to","the","groin","to","show","how","much","we","appreci","thi","crapsterpiec","call","hobgoblin"],"filtered":["hee","hee","hee","thi","movi","bad","doe","even","try","hide","fact","suck","big","time","rememb","dai","see","thi","mst","sun","shine","look","like","good","dai","see","thi","product","rick","sloan","consist","horribl","plush","doll","wreak","havoc","crappi","fest","land","kevin","wussi","extraordinair","try","impress","hi","girlfriend","manag","assist","secur","guard","job","fight","rake","plenti","much","stuff","thi","veri","badli","make","seri","imag","plot","stori","ne","obvious","act","necessari","film","prove","armi","gui","hi","sex","craze","girl","make","wanna","leap","cliff","dorki","friend","get","hi","kick","phone","sex","make","sai","get","nice","red","short","plu","realli","hate","old","secur","guard","wish","accid","hi","supermarket","cart","think","wait","club","scum","scene","ask","road","rashbr","br","advis","view","thi","film","good","month","regain","sens","saniti","see","rick","sloan","give","good","kick","groin","show","much","appreci","thi","crapsterpiec","call","hobgoblin"],"filtered2":["hee","hee","hee","bad","doe","even","try","hide","fact","suck","big","time","rememb","dai","see","mst","sun","shine","look","like","good","dai","see","product","rick","sloan","consist","horribl","plush","doll","wreak","havoc","crappi","fest","land","kevin","wussi","extraordinair","try","impress","girlfriend","manag","assist","secur","guard","job","fight","rake","plenti","stuff","veri","badli","make","imag","plot","stori","ne","obvious","act","necessari","prove","armi","gui","sex","craze","girl","make","wanna","leap","cliff","dorki","friend","get","kick","phone","sex","make","get","nice","red","short","plu","realli","hate","old","secur","guard","wish","accid","supermarket","cart","think","wait","club","scum","scene","ask","road","rashbr","advis","view","good","month","regain","sens","saniti","see","rick","sloan","give","good","kick","groin","show","appreci","crapsterpiec","call","hobgoblin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,8,9,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,21,28,30,32,36,55,67,82,84,97,110,132,142,161,173,190,230,233,254,262,272,289,290,306,312,331,339,341,345,361,399,418,421,448,540,707,730,742,749,779,828,869,870,888,961,982,983,1035,1077,1080,1231,1310,1325,1491,1592,1621,1709,1757,1769,2017,2043,2254,2686,2769,2832,2872,2873,3703,4116,5088,5127,5706,5858,6470,7000,7475,7493,7615,8313],"values":[3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,8,9,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,21,28,30,32,36,55,67,82,84,97,110,132,142,161,173,190,230,233,254,262,272,289,290,306,312,331,339,341,345,361,399,418,421,448,540,707,730,742,749,779,828,869,870,888,961,982,983,1035,1077,1080,1231,1310,1325,1491,1592,1621,1709,1757,1769,2017,2043,2254,2686,2769,2832,2872,2873,3703,4116,5088,5127,5706,5858,6470,7000,7475,7493,7615,8313],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,2.0358433949768115,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.5452294193519092,1

{"value":"I was in second grade, 12 years ago. I remember it clearly. We were learning about space. All little kids want to go to space, right? Well, after I saw this, I was so scared to death that I would 'accidentally' get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind. I had no idea that this was a movie. I thought it was some news program or something. I guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program 'War of the Worlds.' So, recently, I get this movie again to watch, realizing my favorite actor, Joaquin Phoenix was in it (then known as Leaf Phoenix). I can tell you, I was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting. I mean, when Andy is in space, she moves in slow motion, did you ever notice that? I don't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow.<br /><br />The best part is when Andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank, and begins to float backwards as the security doors close.

{"value":"Some films are so bad that they're good. This is clearly not one of them. Based on a true story, this film was about as true to the story as Pinocchio's chances of becoming a real boy. The acting was terrible, the direction was poor, and it travelled way too fast. It was as if the director just wanted to get it over and done with and go home.<br /><br />Nor did Melissa Joan Hart ever strike me as a talented actress, but then every film she made was pretty low-budget anyway. Like most of her other films, she lets down her characters by hamming them up too much, talking too quickly as if speeding up her words is going to make her more dramatic. She really brings out the sense that there is a crew in front of her and she's talking to a camera, when she should be engaging the viewer in her character. It pretty much lets down the whole film, and any leg that it may have had left to stand on, is ruined.<br /><br />Probably the only good thing about the film is when she got nailed in the end.

{"value":"Mr. Mike was probably the most misanthropic comedian of all time, so I was interested to see what he'd do with total creative control over a movie. Sadly, it is unwatchable, though not because the jokes aren't funny--some (I won't say most) of them are, and in fact Mr. Mike did a good job translating his mentally unbalanced screeds into visual gags. The trouble is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, you name it) is so God-awful, the movie is intolerable. Some outfit called \"PKO Productions\" gets the producing credit, but it doesn't look produced at all; it looks more like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL set and made the whole thing in an afternoon. I realize Mike's goal was to torture the audience, but even that deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear or comprehend whatever it is that's supposed to be shocking. Still, the DVD isn't a total waste: it includes a eulogy for O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three \"Mr. Mike's Least Loved Bedtime Stories\" from SNL. Plus, the \"cat swimming\" section of the movie is a great scene to be caught watching if you want to freak someone out.

{"value":"There was not one single redeeming factor in this movie. The girlfriend and I both love action films. Especially fight scenes (Bloodsport and Kickboxer was awesome), but this movie was not entertaining. Five minutes of action followed twenty minutes of talking and \"angry\" facial expressions. The main hero is a troubled character who has seen battle and thus is forced to look seriously constipated at all times. The Army has disrupted his bowel movements on top of perfecting his fighting technique. The music isn't good either. They fight to the rap and hip-hop style of the streets, 'cause these guys are thugs. The rest of the soundtrack is the usual background noise to low-budget dramas.<br /><br />Everything about this movie is classic B-style. The actors deliver their lines as if reading them from cue cards and the lines themselves should be set on fire and left burning in some rotten Hollywood alleyway. The film is called \"Honor,\" but there was no honor in making this film. It was simply a waste of money, and spending wisely is something I consider to be honorable.<br /><br />Go see Felon instead. The fight scenes and situations are more real.","finished_norm":["there","be","not","on","singl","redeem","factor","in","thi","movi","the","girlfriend","and","i","both","love","action","film","especi","fight","scene","bloodsport","and","kickbox","be","awesom","but","thi","movi","be","not","entertain","five","minut","of","action","follow","twenti","minut","of","talk","and","angri","facial","express","the","main","hero","be","a","troubl","charact","who","have","see","battl","and","thu","be","forc","to","look","serious","constip","at","all","time","the","armi","have","disrupt","hi","bowel","movem","on","top","of","perfect","hi","fight","techniqu","the","music","be","not","good","either","thei","fight","to","the","rap","and","hiphop","styl","of","the","street","caus","thi","gui","be","thug","the","rest","of","the","soundtrack","be","the","usual","background","nois","to","lowbudget","dramasbr","br","everyth","about","thi","movi","be","classic","bstyl","the","actor","deliv","their","line","a","if","read","them","from","cue","card","and","the","line","themselv","should","be","set","on","fire","and","leav","burn","in","some","rotten","hollywood","alleywai","the","film","be","call","honor","but","there","be","no","honor","in","make","thi","film","it","be","simpli","a","wast","of","monei","and","spend","wise","be","someth","i","consid","to","be","honorablebr","br","go","see","felon","instead","the","fight","scene","and","situat","be","much","real"],"filtered":["singl","redeem","factor","thi","movi","girlfriend","love","action","film","especi","fight","scene","bloodsport","kickbox","awesom","thi","movi","entertain","five","minut","action","follow","twenti","minut","talk","angri","facial","express","main","hero","troubl","charact","see","battl","thu","forc","look","serious","constip","time","armi","disrupt","hi","bowel","movem","top","perfect","hi","fight","techniqu","music","good","either","thei","fight","rap","hiphop","styl","street","caus","thi","gui","thug","rest","soundtrack","usual","background","nois","lowbudget","dramasbr","br","everyth","thi","movi","classic","bstyl","actor","deliv","line","read","cue","card","line","themselv","set","fire","leav","burn","rotten","hollywood","alleywai","film","call","honor","honor","make","thi","film","simpli","wast","monei","spend","wise","someth","consid","honorablebr","br","go","see","felon","instead","fight","scene","situat","much","real"],"filtered2":["singl","redeem","factor","girlfriend","love","action","especi","fight","scene","bloodsport","kickbox","awesom","entertain","five","minut","action","follow","twenti","minut","talk","angri","facial","express","main","hero","troubl","charact","see","battl","thu","forc","look","serious","constip","time","armi","disrupt","bowel","movem","top","perfect","fight","techniqu","music","good","either","fight","rap","hiphop","styl","street","caus","gui","thug","rest","soundtrack","usual","background","nois","lowbudget","dramasbr","everyth","classic","bstyl","actor","deliv","line","read","cue","card","line","themselv","set","fire","leav","burn","rotten","hollywood","alleywai","call","honor","honor","make","simpli","wast","monei","spend","wise","someth","consid","honorablebr","go","see","felon","instead","fight","scene","situat","real"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,8,10,16,19,41,53,54,55,59,74,80,89,107,109,118,126,129,142,145,152,179,186,193,195,201,207,226,233,260,265,267,283,300,317,332,338,364,371,375,380,436,443,452,473,504,517,551,634,664,677,730,752,786,796,801,846,862,982,1161,1192,1222,1501,1572,1574,1577,1635,1659,1679,1794,2050,2206,2228,2558,2581,2763,6785,7428,8127,8286],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,8,10,16,19,41,53,54,55,59,74,80,89,107,109,118,126,129,142,145,152,179,186,193,195,201,207,226,233,260,265,267,283,300,317,332,338,364,371,375,380,436,443,452,473,504,517,551,634,664,677,730,752,786,796,801,846,862,982,1161,1192,1222,1501,1572,1574,1577,1635,1659,1679,1794,2050,2206,2228,2558,2581,2763,6785,7428,8127,8286],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,2.62476135602347,1.5687599167621034,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,1.9536997889255368,3.7386508898401445,1.9486336368009016,1.9951803900462557,1.9940046109572438,4.287906797278791,2.125691139326857,2.354379525480895,2.2391270689902285,4.821391668015843,2.2844323215331563,2.34599021453259,2.3131195476980753,2.507968722980095,2.571852579609833,2.517840471459249,2.51289241584188,2.561435818751577,2.5531798379045583,2.5940874818617203,11.351133624517006,2.6754694156628323,2.73529586597515,2.7085302779237206,2.767880202308154

{"value":"<br /><br />However, the ladies of all ages will lap it up, no doubt; at least the opposite sex understand what it is to be a mother, and most of us men try to fathom out what it is to be a father. Whether changing nappies is not at all my favourite occupation and trying to get those bottled baby-foodstuffs into errant toothless mouths must rank very high on household duties preferably left to its mother, has absolutely nothing to do with the matter.<br /><br />Some good interpretations here, and a good story idea; the handling of the matter, limited to rather scanty TV-production concepts, gives the film a rather over-mellowy taste with not much new to offer. An insipid way of delivering the goods, and in the end the outcome is so forseeable during the last 20 minutes or so, even my wife dozed off, and I was jumping up to the computer to get the on-line scoring in the Barcelona-Deportivo match, hoping the away team would do something rather good.

{"value":"Anyone who has seen 'Shine',Scott Hicks film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately joyful life of the pianist David Helfgotts; will I am sure realise that 'The SOLOIST' is very poor in comparison.It is as slow as a lullaby( I took five breaks answering emails just to wake up). The depiction of the homeless area way over the top and extremely self indulgent, on a par I fear with the awful beach battle depiction in Joe Wrights other disaster Attonment. .J Fox performance was an extremely poor example of acting and lacked credibility from the offset.Downey on the other hand; although struggling with a badly paced film, still manages to charm,9Is it me or is he turning into George Clooney in more ways than one?). Comparing both these well known so called 'STAR'actors though is unnecessary as the light that shines brightest as far as acting is concerned must be that of 'shine's' Geoeffry Rush who's brilliant performance definitely SHONE far brighter in my sky. With both 'Attonment' and 'The Soloist' the written word wins far more prizes for empathy of subject.

{"value":"is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface. So in that respect, IMDb's average voting score is spot on.<br /><br />A Spanish film made in the USA with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of \"Falcon Crest\" dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time, as well as wasting the money of those who backed the project financially.<br /><br />The slugs involved are originals from Asturias, northern Spain, but as they were not allowed into the United States, plastic ones had to be made. However, chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner-time salad contrasts rather weirdly with Parisienne music as well as a rather tatty array of other US forgotten hits (or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it). The actors involved were also a rather tatty array, just suitable for a low-budget film which might be categorised as horrific, horrifying, horrible or just simple awful.<br /><br />As a result, the outcome is negligible on the surface, undetected underground, and about as attractive as Chapter 17,000 of Coronation Street or the latest news from Baghdad.","finished_norm":["be","seismic","activ","with","littl","or","neglig","result","on","the","surfac","so","in","that","respect","imdb","averag","vote","score","be","spot","onbr","br","a","spanish","film","make","in","the","usa","with","or","rate","actor","give","a","kind","of","falcon","crest","dimens","to","the","whole","affair","be","a","wonder","wai","to","wast","your","time","a","good","a","wast","the","monei","of","that","who","back","the","project","financiallybr","br","the","slug","involv","be","origin","from","asturia","northern","spain","but","a","thei","be","not","allow","into","the","unit","state","plastic","on","have","to","be","make","howev","chop","them","up","in","the","lettuc","be","us","for","make","the","even","dinnertim","salad","contrast","rather","weirdli","with","parisienn","music","a","good","a","a","rather","tatti","arrai","of","other","u","forget","hit","or","miss","if","you","have","no","idea","who","be","respons","for","compos","it","the","actor","involv","be","conjur","a","rather","tatti","arrai","just","suitabl","for","a","lowbudget","film","which","mai","be","categoris","a","horrif","horrifi","horribl","or","just","simpl","awfulbr","br","a","a","result","the","outcom","be","neglig","on","the","surfac","undetect","underground","and","about","a","attract","a","chapter","of","coron","street","or","the","late","new","from","baghdad"],"filtered":["seismic","activ","littl","neglig","result","surfac","respect","imdb","averag","vote","score","spot","onbr","br","spanish","film","make","usa","rate","actor","give","kind","falcon","crest","dimens","whole","affair","wonder","wai","wast","time","good","wast","monei","back","project","financiallybr","br","slug","involv","origin","asturia","northern","spain","thei","allow","unit","state","plastic","make","howev","chop","lettuc","us","make","even","dinnertim","salad","contrast","rather","weirdli","parisienn","music","good","rather","tatti","arrai","u","forget","hit","miss","idea","respons","compos","actor","involv","conjur","rather","tatti","arrai","suitabl","lowbudget","film","mai","categoris","horrif","horrifi","horribl","simpl","awfulbr","br","result","outcom","neglig","surfac","undetect","underground","attract","chapter","coron","street","late","new","baghdad"],"filtered2":["seismic","activ","littl","neglig","result","surfac","respect","imdb","averag","vote","score","spot","onbr","spanish","make","usa","rate","actor","give","kind","falcon","crest","dimens","whole","affair","wonder","wai","wast","time","good","wast","monei","back","project","financiallybr","slug","involv","origin","asturia","northern","spain","allow","unit","state","plastic","make","howev","chop","lettuc","us","make","even","dinnertim","salad","contrast","rather","weirdli","parisienn","music","good","rather","tatti","arrai","u","forget","hit","miss","idea","respons","compos","actor","involv","conjur","rather","tatti","arrai","suitabl","lowbudget","mai","categoris","horrif","horrifi","horribl","simpl","awfulbr","result","outcom","neglig","surfac","undetect","underground","attract","chapter","coron","street","late","new","baghdad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,8,14,30,33,39,41,46,56,63,69,87,89,111,112,113,118,122,123,126,150,160,175,202,230,241,255,372,388,447,498,518,521,591,643,648,659,664,694,736,915,1005,1189,1201,1222,1481,1668,1700,1738,1856,1944,2083,2109,2144,2283,2327,2383,2515,2562,2767,3237,3471,3582,3891,4349,4688,6284,6775,7280,7811,8217],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,8,14,30,33,39,41,46,56,63,69,87,89,111,112,113,118,122,123,126,150,160,175,202,230,241,255,372,388,447,498,518,521,591,643,648,659,664,694,736,915,1005,1189,1201,1222,1481,1668,1700,1738,1856,1944,2083,2109,2144,2283,2327,2383,2515,2562,2767,3237,3471,3582,3891,4349,4688,6284,6775,7280,7811,8217],"values":[1.8599301468615699,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.1175081997259209,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.5538940054862738,3.1375198335242067,1.655771293751733,1.8610609350701788,1.8729627573220065,2.127032521151058,2.115024371522662,3.9880092219144876,2.1183455303375887,2.2466628996789315,2.1521782565202803,2.354379525480895,2.2489347673732487,2.2619070973220485,2.2391270689902285,2.332712011146513,7.116688659540377,2.3791142619576227,2.597304642813496,2.7121382192999195,5.325548992363167,2.6754694156628323,3.0316467233633775,3.0914425013694116,6.414054501606195,3.386191741044285,3.4101163271295305,3.4076979462652486,3.509308122676031,3.5813614403160887,3.6105180246075443,3.6405503117064195,3.6905607322810807,3.6284289511740746,3.6841709341823097,3.9363956947973615,4.062925891962901,4.291900363587903,4.315570107673808,4.3

{"value":"This film was terrible. I have given it the high score of 2 as I have seen worse, but very few.<br /><br />From the clichéd start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making just for the sake of it, like a kid with too many toys. There was the endless, boring repetitive narration, slow motion, freeze frame, flashbacks and merged images etc - none of which made a dull film any better.<br /><br />It is called \"16 years of alcohol\", but there was little drinking or drunkeness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place with no coherent sense. The story was badly written and extremely pretentious and the direction was equally poor and it is a shame that people have put up further money for more films by Mr Jobson, previously know for being in a rubbish group and on TV making as much sense as this film does.<br /><br />I found it a major struggle to see this to the end but in the hope of it getting better I carried on to the bitter but

{"value":"This movie isn't worth the film it was photographed on. The dialog is flat, filled with cliché overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time. The choppy, shaky, film style is a cheap imitation of the \"The Ring\" style visual effects. The characters do not even act like a normal person would. For example, the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door, creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn't even once call out her sister's name to see if she is home. What? You would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her. Way too many flashbacks to her childhood. Too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director. It is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street, up the driveway, around this corner, over here, over there, oh a side view, now a front view. Enough already. You would think you are watching a TV commercial for the Solaris! Terrible movie. 0 out of 100.

{"value":"\"Valentine\" is another horror movie to add to the stalk and slash movie list (think \"Halloween\", \"Friday the 13th\", \"Scream\", and \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\"). It certainly isn't as good as those movies that I have listed about, but it's better than most of the ripoffs that came out after the first \"Friday the 13th\" film. One of those films was the 1981 Canadian made \"My Bloody Valentine\", which I hated alot. \"Valentine\" is a better film than that one, but it's not saying much. The plot: a nerdy young boy is teased and pranked by a couple of his classmates at the beginning of the film. Then the film moves years later when those classmates are all grown up, then they're picked off one-by-one. The killer is presumed to be the young boy now all grown up looking for revenge. But is it him? Or could it be somebody else? \"Valentine\" has an attractive cast which includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material they've got, but a lackluster script doesn't really do them any justice.

{"value":"Wow, this film was just bloody horrid. SO bad in fact that even though I didn't pay to see it, I still wanted my money back.<br /><br />The film is about nothing intelligible. It's a mish-mash of sci-fi cliche's that were done better by much more skilled film makers. The performances, especially by the leads were over the top in a less endearing Ed Wood sort of way. Speaking of Ed Wood, he'd be proud of the character's dialogue. It's just too taciturn with no hint of irony or sense of humor. On top of that, it doesn't make sense, nor does the plot, or lackthereof.<br /><br />The visual effects are okay, but not enough to go \"oh wow, that's cool\" and they just seem to be thrown in to \"be cool\" rather than be a good plot device.<br /><br />The soundtrack was another mishmash of stuff that really never set any sort of mood. Again, it seemed as if the director was just throwing in songs in the film in an effort to \"be cool\".<br /><br />Which brings me to my final point.

{"value":"I read the reviews for this and while not expecting a saving private Ryan I was expecting a film of some substance.<br /><br />The film starts off very lob-sided with the usual intro of history and how the unit came into being. But immediately it's 1944 and you are not sure where everyone is. The accents etc are very poor as this unit is supposed to be Hawaiian/Asian American but everyone speaks in a very poor take on Harvard English imitation of a Japanese person.<br /><br />I gave this film 3 out of 10 as after 10 minutes I couldn't watch any more of it. The characters were 1 dimensional and even though they were most likely based on real people I had no feeling for them and this left me not caring about them. Very poor direction of a very average TV movie which will be shown at midnight on some cable channel. I'd avoid and look out for better efforts.<br /><br />This is a good story but it was deserving of a better telling. You got a sense the director had seen band of brothers and thought that that was enough to sell his movie.

{"value":"The Forest isn't just your everyday standard slasher/backwoods cannibal fare, it also has an interesting mix of supernatural elements as well. The story is about two couples that hike into the forest on a camping trip. A cave dwelling, cannibalistic woodsmen and the ghosts of his dead wife and two children soon terrorize them. There is something you don't see every slasher. Director Don Jones gets an \"A\" for effort although the film itself falls flat on just about every level, the acting is just simply average except for Jeanette Kelly who plays the dead wife of the woodsman (Michael Brody aka Gary Kent).<br /><br />The film opens with some beautiful shots of a couple hiking through a valley and into a forest. They realize too late that someone is stalking them. They are both dispatched in typical slasher fare. Our killer uses a trusty hunting knife throughout the entire film, except during a flashback when he implements a handsaw, pitchfork and rusty saw blade to dispatch his cheating wife's lover.<br /><br />The Forest has a good story line but the movie just doesn't work along with it I found it pretty boring with simply crappy acting.

{"value":"Gday Mates! just watched Croc Hunter the movie. it was alright but the show seems more real. this just seemed like a longer AnimalPlanet episode with funnier lines and more characters. A few things: Steve described snakes Fangs like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! for reals you know that hurts. and cant they jump up high? hes all grabbin them by the tail and stuff. There was two MAJOR cleavage shots in this movie. when Terry find that baby joey she goes like \"We have to nurture them, just like a baby\". Woah! i thought she was gonna up & breast feed that kid. that woulda made it PG-13 though. While on Terry, did anyone notice on the movie and a lot of the show Terry's knowledge on ritual mating. she knows her sex stuffs. movie takes place in Queensland, Austrailia. I want a koala, dingo, and joey!<br /><br />Steve's dog Sui actually has a purpose in this movie. albeit a small one which proves useless against the dynamite-wielding hottie.<br /><br />Oh and if

{"value":"The movie is basically the story of a Russian prostitute's return to her home village for the funeral of a sister/friend. There are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken, but they are not fully explored. The core of the movie is the funeral, wake, and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable. Apparently, the movie is unedited. The prostitute's journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud. Maybe that's supposed to impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape. The village itself, such as it is, is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male, the consort of the dead girl. Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible. Most of the film is shot with a hand-held camera that could induce nausea. Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles don't include the songs and laments of the crones.

{"value":"I hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input. I know they're going for realism, but to be frank I just don't want realism. Realism is boring. If I want to see daily life, I'll uhm, live. Tell me an interesting story and we'll talk. I can deal with the low production values, hell I'm a sucker for low production values, but at least work in some good ideas. The direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit, but obviously I'm supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic. Hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out. I can only conclude this is not drama, not by a long shot. We get to see Rosetta walking to someplace, Rosetta working in a bakery, Rosetta eating a waffle, Rosetta carrying around bags of far, Rosetta walking back home, Rosetta walking someplace...it's just not that entertaining. There isn't really a deeper meaning either. I got so bored I started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but it's just plain realism, the most overrated quality in the business.

{"value":"Why such a generic title? Santa Claus??? So bland and unpredictable. Movies before that tried to cash in on the holiday spirit, most notably 'Santa Claus Conquers the Martians', at least was entertaining to watch because of the campiness to it, and all the stock footage being used... for some reason, that seemed happy to me. But this movie just screws Christmas in the butt, and screws the joy of all the kids. Santa lives in space? His enemy is a devil named Pitch? Santa gets help from Merlin the Magician? How random is this!? Well, since it was made in Mexico then some of you might understand the way of how the film was made. I had to admit some of the effects were just wacky for the time. It was a all-out cluster of madness! Though, despite all the troubles with the movie, it still feels like a Christmas movie. Good conquers evil, and Christmas still plays a part of our hearts of every good girl or boy in the world, or possibly universe, thanks to Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.. apparently.

{"value":"I'm working my way through the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES is one of the movies in the set. I am watching them with my soon-to-be seven-year old daughter, which makes most of these movies a laugh riot.<br /><br />I had high hopes for REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES, after watching White Zombie, which is really the precursor to so much that is the mainstay of zombies in cinema (think Clive Barker's Serpent and the Rainbow and James Bond's Live and Let Die funeral scene, NOT Night of the Living Dead).<br /><br />However, even though the title includes the word \"zombies,\" it is little more than a love triangle, involving anthropologist Armand Louque, who is smitten with Claire Duval; who in turn is taken with his companion Clifford Grayson. What a yawn-fest, my daughter fell asleep half-way through.<br /><br />I had a real hard time deciphering who these people worked for -- the allies or the axis; but, I guess that doesn't really matter.<br /><br />I was shocked to see Bela Lugosi in the credits for this movie; but, of course those were his eyes (from White Zombie) serving as the mind-control device for the zombies.","finished_norm":["i","be","work","my","wai","through","the","horror","classic","movi","pack","collect","and","revolt","of","the","zombi","be","on","of","the","movi","in","the","set","i","be","watch","them","with","my","soontob","sevenyear","old","daughter","which","make","much","of","thi","movi","a","laugh","riotbr","br","i","have","high","hope","for","revolt","of","the","zombi","after","watch","white","zombi","which","be","realli","the","precursor","to","so","much","that","be","the","mainstai","of","zombi","in","cinema","think","clive","barker","serpent","and","the","rainbow","and","jame","bond","live","and","let","die","funer","scene","not","night","of","the","live","deadbr","br","howev","even","though","the","titl","includ","the","word","zombi","it","be","littl","much","than","a","love","triangl","involv","anthropologist","armand","louqu","who","be","smite","with","clair","duval","who","in","turn","be","take","with","hi","companion","clifford","grayson","what","a","yawnfest","my","daughter","fall","asleep","halfwai","throughbr","br","i","have","a","real","hard","time","deciph","who","thi","peopl","work","for","the","alli","or","the","axi","but","i","guess","that","doe","not","realli","matterbr","br","i","be","shock","to","see","bela","lugosi","in","the","credit","for","thi","movi","but","of","cours","that","be","hi","ey","from","white","zombi","serv","a","the","mindcontrol","devic","for","the","zombi"],"filtered":["work","wai","horror","classic","movi","pack","collect","revolt","zombi","movi","set","watch","soontob","sevenyear","old","daughter","make","much","thi","movi","laugh","riotbr","br","high","hope","revolt","zombi","watch","white","zombi","realli","precursor","much","mainstai","zombi","cinema","think","clive","barker","serpent","rainbow","jame","bond","live","let","die","funer","scene","night","live","deadbr","br","howev","even","though","titl","includ","word","zombi","littl","much","love","triangl","involv","anthropologist","armand","louqu","smite","clair","duval","turn","take","hi","companion","clifford","grayson","yawnfest","daughter","fall","asleep","halfwai","throughbr","br","real","hard","time","deciph","thi","peopl","work","alli","axi","guess","doe","realli","matterbr","br","shock","see","bela","lugosi","credit","thi","movi","cours","hi","ey","white","zombi","serv","mindcontrol","devic","zombi"],"filtered2":["work","wai","horror","classic","pack","collect","revolt","zombi","set","watch","soontob","sevenyear","old","daughter","make","laugh","riotbr","high","hope","revolt","zombi","watch","white","zombi","realli","precursor","mainstai","zombi","cinema","think","clive","barker","serpent","rainbow","jame","bond","live","let","die","funer","scene","night","live","deadbr","howev","even","though","titl","includ","word","zombi","littl","love","triangl","involv","anthropologist","armand","louqu","smite","clair","duval","turn","take","companion","clifford","grayson","yawnfest","daughter","fall","asleep","halfwai","throughbr","real","hard","time","deciph","peopl","work","alli","axi","guess","doe","realli","matterbr","shock","see","bela","lugosi","credit","cours","ey","white","zombi","serv","mindcontrol","devic","zombi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,8,12,13,14,18,19,23,31,33,48,54,67,80,83,86,96,109,113,116,124,133,169,171,181,199,210,211,241,243,258,264,268,281,293,301,332,356,359,409,426,508,620,815,1026,1346,1396,1507,1555,2033,2167,2280,2483,2745,3156,3290,3550,3579,4178,4296,5241,5692,6211,7030,7289,7778,7807,8562],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,8,12,13,14,18,19,23,31,33,48,54,67,80,83,86,96,109,113,116,124,133,169,171,181,199,210,211,241,243,258,264,268,281,293,301,332,356,359,409,426,508,620,815,1026,1346,1396,1507,1555,2033,2167,2280,2483,2745,3156,3290,3550,3579,4178,4296,5241,5692,6211,7030,7289,7778,7807,8562],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.364847727375781,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,3.3910232448024944,1.8113893252729412,1.9570915389266579,1.9951803900462557,2.292318797740072,2.031112399272319,2.0390708128715254,2.125691139326857,2.1521782565202803,4.493325799357863,2.2323930368088845,2.3212364753796515,2.4071371113909277,2.373087554090762,2.4442286541160034,2.558331832813986,2.687151791517189,2.5687161421197025,2.6627744961815836,2.627841366673578,2.7061321952397077,2.757740698455715,25.722635023492977,2.832333801361687,2.9012296278682137,2.8309760279012264,2.9705344631698933,3.028335462059722,6.437911643336743,3.2209578243390444,6.781862172816363,3.4149707055943286,3.

{"value":"Nobody could like this movie for its merit but, if you have a sense of humor and enjoy schlock movies for their MST3 quality, then this is for you. It ranks up there with \"Road House\" for its preposterous characters, sets and story line. The bad writing really cracked me up: \"I want you to dust those guys off\" instead of \". . . dust those guys.\" F-14s take off from the carrier but, when they get into formation, they're F-16s! Without a hint of anger or skepticism, Segal goes back to work for the general who, only minutes before, was overseeing a covert \"mind wipe\" on Seagal. Segal runs out of bullets and resorts to a knife to kill the guards. So naturally, the guards all drop their guns and fight with knives too! The hand grenade is a dud but explodes anyway. The little stealth fighter can fly all the way from California to Afganistan without refueling. Then Segal flies it back to California - the long way, i.e., by way of Europe - even though there's a carrier giving him air support 20 minutes away in the Arabian Sea. The CIC in the carrier consists of 3 black PCs, 2 flat screen TVs and pictures of gauges and maps on the walls.

{"value":"The movie starts quite with an intriguing scene, three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar. All of them are making up a bit outrageous stories. As the movie unfolds, it turns out that the most outrageous story is true. However, beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed. This revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly, not much is left to be seen. The rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken Russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies. Sure, these are fascinating and a bit shocking images, but admiring them goes on way too long, sacrificing any possible plot or character development. I found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie-making, where instead of trying to make an interesting story, movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories (case in point - meat trader's story) to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends. On a surface it has artsy appearance, but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent.","finished_norm":["the","movi","start","quit","with","a","intrigu","scene","three","peopl","be","drink","and","make","small","talk","in","a","bar","all","of","them","be","make","up","a","bite","outrag","stori","a","the","movi","unfold","it","turn","out","that","the","much","outrag","stori","be","true","howev","beyond","that","the","movi","be","not","veri","interest","except","for","the","scene","in","the","bar","and","the","scene","where","main","secret","be","reveal","thi","revel","happen","bare","half","time","into","the","movi","and","frankli","not","much","be","leav","to","be","see","the","rest","of","the","time","director","be","linger","in","a","god","forsak","russian","villag","full","of","piti","and","creepi","old","ladi","sure","thi","be","fascin","and","a","bite","shock","imag","but","admir","them","go","on","wai","too","long","sacrific","ani","possibl","plot","or","charact","develop","i","find","thi","movi","a","anoth","exampl","of","either","lousi","or","lazi","moviemak","where","instead","of","try","to","make","a","interest","stori","movi","maker","concentr","on","weirdli","fascin","imageri","and","through","in","a","few","almost","unrel","stori","case","in","point","meat","trader","stori","to","leav","the","spectat","to","figur","out","all","odd","and","end","on","a","surfac","it","have","artsi","appear","but","in","thi","particular","case","be","noth","much","than","lack","of","talent"],"filtered":["movi","start","quit","intrigu","scene","three","peopl","drink","make","small","talk","bar","make","bite","outrag","stori","movi","unfold","turn","much","outrag","stori","true","howev","beyond","movi","veri","interest","except","scene","bar","scene","main","secret","reveal","thi","revel","happen","bare","half","time","movi","frankli","much","leav","see","rest","time","director","linger","god","forsak","russian","villag","full","piti","creepi","old","ladi","sure","thi","fascin","bite","shock","imag","admir","go","wai","long","sacrific","ani","possibl","plot","charact","develop","find","thi","movi","anoth","exampl","either","lousi","lazi","moviemak","instead","try","make","interest","stori","movi","maker","concentr","weirdli","fascin","imageri","almost","unrel","stori","case","point","meat","trader","stori","leav","spectat","figur","odd","end","surfac","artsi","appear","thi","particular","case","noth","much","lack","talent"],"filtered2":["start","quit","intrigu","scene","three","peopl","drink","make","small","talk","bar","make","bite","outrag","stori","unfold","turn","outrag","stori","true","howev","beyond","veri","interest","except","scene","bar","scene","main","secret","reveal","revel","happen","bare","half","time","frankli","leav","see","rest","time","director","linger","god","forsak","russian","villag","full","piti","creepi","old","ladi","sure","fascin","bite","shock","imag","admir","go","wai","long","sacrific","ani","possibl","plot","charact","develop","find","anoth","exampl","either","lousi","lazi","moviemak","instead","try","make","interest","stori","maker","concentr","weirdli","fascin","imageri","almost","unrel","stori","case","point","meat","trader","stori","leav","spectat","figur","odd","end","surfac","artsi","appear","particular","case","noth","lack","talent"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,8,10,15,17,19,23,24,27,32,33,36,38,49,58,60,66,67,71,73,74,94,96,99,113,119,120,131,152,154,170,179,183,186,206,207,224,226,232,276,288,304,307,320,336,352,363,402,415,472,502,508,594,667,742,755,763,772,798,832,833,1017,1070,1116,1234,1257,1266,1273,1333,1530,1688,1739,1986,2117,2144,2392,2507,2578,2709,3335,3515,3541,4587,7052,7868,8217],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,8,10,15,17,19,23,24,27,32,33,36,38,49,58,60,66,67,71,73,74,94,96,99,113,119,120,131,152,154,170,179,183,186,206,207,224,226,232,276,288,304,307,320,336,352,363,402,415,472,502,508,594,667,742,755,763,772,798,832,833,1017,1070,1116,1234,1257,1266,1273,1333,1530,1688,1739,1986,2117,2144,2392,2507,2578,2709,3335,3515,3541,4587,7052,7868,8217],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,6.385268470052984,3.9371420340352055,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.6920303308087352,1.865701314626681,3.676353282473182,1.929723173391612,1.9570915389266579,1.9214926742550966,1.8950689206770979,3.8972672736018033,2.08112281984698,2.0390708128715254,2.056430207256609,2.1521782565202803,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.2512118082053005,2.3131195476980753,4.696999252276

{"value":"If you like to be entertained, do not go see this movie. If you like to see heroics of war, do not go see this movie. If you like to see good acting and an excellent screenplay, do not go see this movie. If you like typical hollywood war films that end just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. Otherwise, don't waste your time. I am always interested in war movies because I think that if they are done well, they can TEACH us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war. This film shows a bunch of guys running around the countryside, saying whorrible cliche lines, doing the most predictable things, and defending the oppressed with the same exact force and brutality that was being given to the oppressed. This film is a disgrace to filmmaking and to the United States of America! Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa, or any other country and watching this, being told that this is how Americans truly are? No wonder everyone hates us!

{"value":"I waited for this movie to play in great anticipation. Assuming it would be more accurately portrayed like the movie, \"The Christmas Box\" based on the book by Richard Paul Evans. I sent out many emails to friends and family asking them to please watch this show, hoping they would better understand a tiny amount of my \"new\" life. After seeing this movie I was so disappointed. As a mother who lost her only child in November 2003 and REALLY knowing the pain, I had hoped that this movie would shed light to parents who \"think\" they understand the grief a parent goes through who has lost a child. This movie was a very light hearted movie and the silliness of Diane Keaton was a slap in the face to parents who have buried a child. It was VERY unrealistic from start to stop. I had a few calls after the movie, each call the same, \"That was so off the mark and made it appear that in a short time you are back on the road and listening to songs on the radio and life is back\" What a bunch of bull! It is clear that the director and Keaton have never lost a child because neither would have EVER made the movie to be so off the mark.

{"value":"I watched this film a long time ago (aprox 10 years or so) and liked it then. I remembered it the other day and decided to watch it again. The second time around was not pleasant. The acting is 'so,so', the plot is illogical, unreasonable and predictable.<br /><br />The acting...I'm sure it wasn't a stretch for those actresses to play those characters. The plot...there's no way in hell those women would have gotten away with the first robbery much less the 2nd. (side note: Why did TT not realise that even if she came up with a load of money for her court date they would ask where she got it and she would have no logical answer! Ding, Ding...we have a crook!). It horribly stereotyped black women in saying basically that the only way black women can 'beat the system' or obtain a large amount of money was to steal it and not use their intelligence or other resources. It plays too much on sympathy b/c all of them die in the end (bar Jada) but it's not sad (you're thinking 'They were so stupid; they deserve to die). You just don't really care about the characters unless you're a shallow person.<br /><br />I can't believe this film rates over a

{"value":"Gene Hackman gets himself busted out of prison by a nameless government agency who want him for an assassination. It's a given of course that Hackman has the proficient skills for the job.<br /><br />Nobody tells him anything though, he's given as the audience is given bits and pieces of information. That's supposed to be suspenseful, instead it's annoying and boring. <br /><br />Hackman goes through with the mission, but the getaway is messed up and the guy at the top of this mysterious entity orders everybody dead to cover it up. So everyone in the cast dies and at the end you don't really care.<br /><br />One of the other reviewers pointed out that the film was originally twice as long, almost three hours and got chopped down quite a bit. Maybe something really was lost in the translation, but I tend to think it was a mercy act on the audience.<br /><br />A very talented cast that had people like Richard Widmark, Candice Bergen, Mickey Rooney, Eli Wallach, and Edward Albert is so thoroughly wasted here it's a crime. <br /><br />And we never do find out just what federal agency was doing all this, the FBI, the CIA, the DEA or even

{"value":"you can be fooled by your first impressions. as in, initial reactions to a movie, for example. as in, the first time i saw this movie i was bedazzled by the idea of it (first of all, i love black comedies). could even - despite being male, myself - empathise with the feisty girls' fervor to see their husbands deceased without delay. was tripped up by my own face-value (and, i do mean \"face-value\") response to nicolette sheridan and a couple of the other delicious dames in the picture. it just goes to show you that you've gotta step back from a situation sometimes and see that it's bad (and not \"bad good,\" either): the reason i'm giving this movie a \"4\" rating is because of ms sheridan and her gams (the rest of 'er is pretty good, too); but this movie has all the hallmark TV movie characteristics - which means you'll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen. the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through - and i'll generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me; and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it. i don't think it's a total waste of time,

{"value":"I stopped by BB and picked up 4 zombie flicks to watch over the weekend. Now, I understand that the effects will be cheesy, the acting will be sub-par, and the sets will be suspect. So I'm not expecting much. But it should at least have a story. Stories don't cost a thing except time.....apparently, they didn't have any time either.<br /><br />\"Zombie Nation\" had 5 zombies that appeared near the end of the movie that all looked like new wave hookers. The picture of the zombie on the front cover NEVER appears in the movie. It was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre.<br /><br />The running time is only 81 minutes but it felt like 2 hours. According to my wife (who could only hear the movie since she was on the computer in another room), it sounded like zombie porn....which if you think about, sounds kinda gross.....but it wasn't even that good.<br /><br />The only suggestion I can make is that maybe the writer tried to do too many things and ended up with an incoherent mess.<br /><br />It ended up being a free rental and I still feel ripped off.

{"value":"Invasion of the Star Creatures would definitely be in the \"so bad it's good\" category if the film wasn't quite so sexist or racist. That it is such just makes it plain bad.<br /><br />It has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in Queen of Outer Space, and the kind of racist stereotypes (in this instance, Native Americans) that you would normally find in thirties & forties b-westerns. In terms of being non-funny, the same walking-through-the-cave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie. Ray does do one good impression of Jimmy Cagney (but can't make it work for two impressions of Cagney in a row, nor handle a Peter Lorre when he tries it). There really aren't any production values to speak of, as the \"Star Creatures\" make the Ro-Man from Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 from Outer Space look like creations of Industrial Light and Magic.<br /><br />This film was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call early independent cinema...not artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the

{"value":"Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time. It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that while I agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to engage you with the characters. Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus, I have to say I couldn't give a turd about Mr Green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world. <br /><br />Also, while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it I would have to disagree - I didn't enjoy because I was bored. I wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help. Call it clever if you will - I think it's repetitious.<br /><br />However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw. Just music over black. Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GR's pretentiousness?

{"value":"Direction must be the problem here. I recently heard John Cleese speaking of working a skit for Fawlty Towers. He was supposed to attack his car with a branch. The first branch was too flimsy and not funny. The second branch was too stiff to be funny. The third was just flimsy enough to be funny. This sort of attention to detail is missing from \"Corky Romano\". No matter how embarrassingly unfunny a comic bit was, it wasn't fixed, and wasn't left on the cutting room floor. The one value I can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie which somehow escaped into distribution without being repaired.<br /><br />I've scanned dozens of other reviews here. The number of reviews praising this absolute waste of time bolsters my suspicion that some people are getting paid to promote titles. I can't fathom how anyone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than a 4, MAX. I mean, come on, 5 is average. I can't imagine anyone, even those making money off of this, rating it even as much as average.<br /><br />This makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time.

{"value":"As an engineer, I must say this show's first season started out very promising. Most of the applied mathematics were somewhat plausible, and the relationships portrayed between the Eppes brothers and father gave the show an interesting edge.<br /><br />But after the first season, the show started degrading, heavily. Most of the mathematics and technology used in crime solving is now utter gibberish and very laughable to all people involved in science & technology for real.<br /><br />The involvement from the actors still feels okay and I can imagine a fair amount of money is still going into producing each episode, but in the end, this has degraded to a very unpleasantly tasting dish which is a mix of a grade C action thriller and CSI style cop show.<br /><br />If you are gonna watch it, go for only the first season and possibly parts of the second.

{"value":"If I could give it less that 1 I would. Do not bother to rent; if someone gives you the DVD burn it.<br /><br />This is horrible movie making. A total waste of even digital \"film\". I have seen better on Youtube made by 12 year old boys. Lommel claims to have written this, if that is the case he is a classic case of someone who is illiterate in two languages. The story line is none existent, the dialog is mainly screaming, the camera work is some sort of attempted arty flairs with nonsensical cutting of totally unrelated jumps to either industrial transportation scenes or some sort of odd angry young woman rift.<br /><br />I can usually follow a less than obvious plot or see the purpose in a \"creative\" film - I like David Lynch.<br /><br />This one is either so far beyond my limited powers of comprehension I missed it or it is totally pointless. I think this is a \"lets see if we can grab a title that will be coming out soon and do a weird rift on it and see if we can grab some of the bucks\" con job.<br /><br />I cannot see why Lionsgate even bothered with this.
