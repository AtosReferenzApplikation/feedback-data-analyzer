{"value":"I normally have no problem walking away from a bad movie, however this was an unique case. This movie was so bad that I actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of good movie time to justify the hour and a half that was wasted. Needless to say I was brutally disappointed. Set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie suffers from numerous problems making it not worth seeing. First, there are gaping plot holes. Second, very few of the C-list (i don't even dare call them B) actors can act worth a damn, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably. Third, the rate of the film is very choppy and awkward to watch most of the time making suspense building very difficult, leading to very few surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic partially because of how it ends (setting/who the killer turns out to be) and partially because the dialog is just atrocious. To the films credit, it is the only movie that I will ever say is the worst movie I have ever scene, and i've seen a lot.<br /><br />So, just like a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling no, you really don't as you run in the opposite direction.","finished_norm":["i","normal","have","no","problem","walk","awai","from","a","bad","movi","howev","thi","be","a","uniqu","case","thi","movi","be","so","bad","that","i","actual","sit","through","the","whole","thing","almost","prai","it","would","have","on","minut","of","good","movi","time","to","justifi","the","hour","and","a","half","that","be","wast","needless","to","sai","i","be","brutal","disappoint","set","at","a","beach","hous","where","a","group","of","colleg","friend","be","celebr","vacat","thi","movi","suffer","from","numer","problem","make","it","not","worth","see","there","be","gape","plot","hole","veri","few","of","the","clist","i","do","not","even","dare","call","them","b","actor","can","act","worth","a","damn","so","ani","scene","that","have","potenti","fail","miser","the","rate","of","the","film","be","veri","choppi","and","awkward","to","watch","much","of","the","time","make","suspens","build","veri","difficult","lead","to","veri","few","surpris","for","the","audienc","and","much","importantli","the","end","be","complet","anticlimat","partial","becaus","of","how","it","end","settingwho","the","killer","turn","out","to","be","and","partial","becaus","the","dialog","be","just","atroci","to","the","film","credit","it","be","the","onli","movi","that","i","will","ever","sai","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","scene","and","i","have","see","a","lotbr","br","so","just","like","a","bad","joke","you","would","have","be","all","the","happi","never","hear","the","next","time","someon","ask","you","if","you","want","to","know","a","secret","you","will","be","yell","no","you","realli","do","not","a","you","run","in","the","opposit","direct"],"filtered":["normal","problem","walk","awai","bad","movi","howev","thi","uniqu","case","thi","movi","bad","actual","sit","whole","thing","almost","prai","minut","good","movi","time","justifi","hour","half","wast","needless","sai","brutal","disappoint","set","beach","hous","group","colleg","friend","celebr","vacat","thi","movi","suffer","numer","problem","make","worth","see","gape","plot","hole","veri","clist","even","dare","call","b","actor","act","worth","damn","ani","scene","potenti","fail","miser","rate","film","veri","choppi","awkward","watch","much","time","make","suspens","build","veri","difficult","lead","veri","surpris","audienc","much","importantli","end","complet","anticlimat","partial","becaus","end","settingwho","killer","turn","partial","becaus","dialog","atroci","film","credit","onli","movi","ever","sai","wrong","movi","ever","scene","see","lotbr","br","like","bad","joke","happi","never","hear","next","time","someon","ask","want","know","secret","yell","realli","run","opposit","direct"],"filtered2":["normal","problem","walk","awai","bad","howev","uniqu","case","bad","actual","sit","whole","thing","almost","prai","minut","good","time","justifi","hour","half","wast","needless","brutal","disappoint","set","beach","hous","group","colleg","friend","celebr","vacat","suffer","numer","problem","make","worth","see","gape","plot","hole","veri","clist","even","dare","call","b","actor","act","worth","damn","ani","scene","potenti","fail","miser","rate","veri","choppi","awkward","watch","time","make","suspens","build","veri","difficult","lead","veri","surpris","audienc","importantli","end","complet","anticlimat","partial","becaus","end","settingwho","killer","turn","partial","becaus","dialog","atroci","credit","onli","ever","wrong","ever","scene","see","lotbr","like","bad","joke","happi","never","hear","next","time","someon","ask","want","know","secret","yell","realli","run","opposit","direct"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,8,9,11,13,15,19,21,22,24,25,26,27,29,32,37,41,42,44,52,59,89,96,102,103,109,111,113,131,137,139,142,155,157,161,167,168,174,187,202,206,213,214,215,216,219,244,252,288,294,297,306,326,356,410,432,477,529,547,605,633,642,700,798,803,810,814,889,1191,1219,1300,1330,1516,1539,1593,1652,1663,1724,1741,1872,2203,2344,2488,2892,2909,3458,6335,6414,8218],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,8,9,11,13,15,19,21,22,24,25,26,27,29,32,37,41,42,44,52,59,89,96,102,103,109,111,113,131,137,139,142,155,157,161,167,168,174,187,202,206,213,214,215,216,219,244,252,288,294,297,306,326,356,410,432,477,529,547,605,633,642,700,798,803,810,814,889,1191,1219,1300,1330,1516,1539,1593,1652,1663,1724,1741,1872,2203,2344,2488,2892,2909,3458,6335,6414,8218],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,2.825681057716235,3.205071257016622,0.99130981533881

{"value":"I sought out a copy of The Forest because I was watching a VH1 special, I think \"Where Are They Now\", and saw the video box flash across the screen during a segment on the actor Corky Pigeon. He played the male child ghost in this B horror horrible, but I remember him from his character Freddy on the Silver Spoons television show. This flick's a major letdown. There's nothing here. It actually took me four months to watch it from start to finish. I kept stopping it in boredom, setting it aside and forgetting about it, then stumbling on it and trying once again to get through it. Obviously, the angle of this film that was intended to set it apart from its counterparts was the supernatural element, the apparitions. And obviously, here, that doesn't work. I can't stand the male leads. I kept expecting them to look down at their palms during the longer dialogue scenes in order to read cheat lines. The situation at the beginning where the couples decide to go camping separately is awkward and plain dumb. I guess the only positive thing to say about this one is the scene where the guy falls and breaks his leg, you can see the bone sticking out of his flesh. It's fairly good gore makeup there. Man, I'm really reaching for a positive now, huh. The only other no-budget horror film on a level as bad as this one would be Home Sweet

{"value":"When someone remakes a classic movie, the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original. Also, there's a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences.<br /><br />Well, the 1973 TV version of \"Double Indemnity\" has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original. The main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all. Fred MacMurray was great as the lecherous, leering insurance agent Walter Neff in the original; Richard Crenna just seems world-weary and tired. Edward G. Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray's boss Barton Keys; Lee J. Cobb, a fine actor, appears almost bored with the proceedings. Samantha Eggar is all wrong as the conniving, back-stabbing Phyllis Dietrichson; while Barbara Stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role, Eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place.<br /><br />Robert Webber, in the old Richard Gaines role as Robinson's boss Norton, and John Fiedler taking the Porter Hall role as the crucial witness, bring some life to the movie. In particular, Webber recreates the Norton role well in a 1970s context.<br /><br />However, after the movie starts, the whole thing just sort of lies there, without any life or electricity. This is one film that never should have been remade.","finished_norm":["when","someon","remak","a","classic","movi","the","remak","be","alwai","unfavor","compar","to","the","origin","conjur","there","a","chanc","that","the","remak","be","so","radic","differ","that","it","be","just","too","unfamiliar","to","audiencesbr","br","good","the","tv","version","of","doubl","indemn","have","almost","ident","scene","and","dialogu","a","the","origin","the","main","differ","be","that","the","remak","just","seem","to","have","no","energi","at","all","fred","macmurrai","be","great","a","the","lecher","leer","insur","agent","walter","neff","in","the","origin","richard","crenna","just","seem","worldweari","and","tire","edward","g","robinson","bring","great","manic","energi","to","hi","role","a","macmurrai","boss","barton","kei","lee","j","cobb","a","fine","actor","appear","almost","bore","with","the","proceed","samantha","eggar","be","all","wrong","a","the","conniv","backstab","phylli","dietrichson","while","barbara","stanwyck","be","just","superb","in","thi","wick","role","eggar","be","overli","polit","and","manner","and","just","seem","wai","out","of","placebr","br","robert","webber","in","the","old","richard","gain","role","a","robinson","boss","norton","and","john","fiedler","take","the","porter","hall","role","a","the","crucial","wit","bring","some","life","to","the","movi","in","particular","webber","recreat","the","norton","role","good","in","a","contextbr","br","howev","after","the","movi","start","the","whole","thing","just","sort","of","lie","there","without","ani","life","or","electr","thi","be","on","film","that","never","should","have","be","remak"],"filtered":["someon","remak","classic","movi","remak","alwai","unfavor","compar","origin","conjur","chanc","remak","radic","differ","unfamiliar","audiencesbr","br","good","tv","version","doubl","indemn","almost","ident","scene","dialogu","origin","main","differ","remak","seem","energi","fred","macmurrai","great","lecher","leer","insur","agent","walter","neff","origin","richard","crenna","seem","worldweari","tire","edward","g","robinson","bring","great","manic","energi","hi","role","macmurrai","boss","barton","kei","lee","j","cobb","fine","actor","appear","almost","bore","proceed","samantha","eggar","wrong","conniv","backstab","phylli","dietrichson","barbara","stanwyck","superb","thi","wick","role","eggar","overli","polit","manner","seem","wai","placebr","br","robert","webber","old","richard","gain","role","robinson","boss","norton","john","fiedler","take","porter","hall","role","crucial","wit","bring","life","movi","particular","webber","recreat","norton","role","good","contextbr","br","howev","movi","start","whole","thing","sort","lie","without","ani","life","electr","thi","film","never","remak"],"filtered2":["someon","remak","classic","remak","alwai","unfavor","compar","origin","conjur","chanc","remak","radic","differ","unfamiliar","audiencesbr","good","tv","version","doubl","indemn","almost","ident","scene","dialogu","origin","main","differ","remak","seem","energi","fred","macmurrai","great","lecher","leer","insur","agent","walter","neff","origin","richard","crenna","seem","worldweari","tire","edward","g","robinson","bring","great","manic","energi","role","macmurrai","boss","barton","kei","lee","j","cobb","fine","actor","appear","almost","bore","proceed","samantha","eggar","wrong","conniv","backstab","phylli","dietrichson","barbara","stanwyck","superb","wick","role","eggar","overli","polit","manner","seem","wai","placebr","robert","webber","old","richard","gain","role","robinson","boss","norton","john","fiedler","take","porter","hall","role","crucial","wit","bring","life","particular","webber","recreat","norton","role","good","contextbr","howev","start","whole","thing","sort","lie","without","ani","life","electr","never","remak"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,19,25,27,29,31,33,35,39,41,42,51,67,69,71,75,108,111,113,125,128,131,139,170,172,179,197,204,220,248,250,269,291,332,464,482,483,486,539,570,575,641,650,832,851,900,1046,1069,1236,1251,1307,1374,1496,1608,1716,1749,1755,1968,2062,2384,2474,2676,2866,3117,3154,3189,3215,3246,4107,4202,4300,4594,4795,4890,4903,4971,5135,5451,5571,5840,5939,6651,6784,6830,6976,8443],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,19,25,27,29,31,33,35,39,41,42,51,67,69,71,75,108,111,113,125,128,131,139,170,172,179,197,204,220,248,250,269,291,332,464,482,483,486,539,570,575,641,650,832,851,900,1046,1069,1236,1251,1307,1374,1496,1608,1716,1749,1755,1968,2062,2384,2474,2676,2866,3117,3154,3189,3215,3246,4107,4202,4300,4594,4795,4890,4903,4971,5135,5451,5571,5840,5939,6651,6784,6830,6976,8443],"values":[1.35722

{"value":"As a former submariner, this was one of the worst submarine movies I have ever seen. First of all, a mutiny aboard any US Naval vessel, particularly a Nuclear Powered Trident submarine in unthinkable. These men are the best of the best and are dedicated to their mission. The responsibility they carry is awesome and they take it very seriously all the way from the Captain to the most junior crew member. I could never see a crew of any ship split their alliance between the Captain and the Executive Officer. An Executive Officer who acted as the Character played by Denzel Washington did would be relieved of his duties and Court Martialed, then drummed from the Navy. It is no surprise the Navy refused to send a technical adviser to help in making this film. Lastly, if any member of a submarine crew made the amount of noise made underway on this vessel they would be severely reprimanded. Submariners learn early in their career to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They don't slam doors and even speak quietly and wear soft soled shoes when underway. I was amazed at how loud they portrayed the crew while underway. Loud music would never be tolerated. I know portraying submarine life in reality would not sell movie tickets, but this is over the top to the point of being ridiculous. I would not recommend this movie to

{"value":"....this mini does not get better with age. I saw this and it's sequel when originally broadcast, and like so many others was blown away. In early 2002 I borrowed the novels for both WOW and W and R and was even more impressed. I then decided that I had to see both again and invested $200 plus on the DVD sets. I watched both minis again in painful detail and realized I had done things backwards - I should have purchased the novels and borrowed the DVD's.<br /><br />Don't believe it is abysmally miscast? Read the novels and see for yourself. Don't think this is dated? Screen it for somebody not old enough to have seen it originally broadcast and watch the reaction you get (warning - reactions from such people range from looks of horror to belly laughs).<br /><br />According to the trivia section for this mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum. Yikes!! Production quality, music scoring, dialog - a great story was turned into a late 70's soap opera by an overly ambitious producer/director who was in way over his head. This thing was dated the minute it was completed.<br /><br />These two minis were great when original broadcast and to those of us who saw them then, tug at a nostalgic string that reminds us of younger days. IMO - this mini does not nearly live up to its reputation and severely disappoints.","finished_norm":["thi","mini","doe","not","get","well","with","ag","i","see","thi","and","it","sequel","when","origin","broadcast","and","like","so","mani","other","be","blow","awai","in","earli","i","borrow","the","novel","for","both","wow","and","w","and","r","and","be","even","much","impress","i","then","decid","that","i","have","to","see","both","again","and","invest","plu","on","the","dvd","set","i","watch","both","mini","again","in","pain","detail","and","realiz","i","have","do","thing","backward","i","should","have","purchas","the","novel","and","borrow","the","dvdsbr","br","do","not","believ","it","be","abysm","miscast","read","the","novel","and","see","for","yourself","do","not","think","thi","be","date","screen","it","for","somebodi","not","old","enough","to","have","see","it","origin","broadcast","and","watch","the","reaction","you","get","warn","reaction","from","such","peopl","rang","from","look","of","horror","to","belli","laughsbr","br","accord","to","the","trivium","section","for","thi","mini","dan","curti","himself","choos","ali","macgraw","and","robert","mitchum","yike","product","qualiti","music","score","dialog","a","great","stori","be","turn","into","a","late","soap","opu","by","a","overli","ambiti","producerdirector","who","be","in","wai","over","hi","head","thi","thing","be","date","the","minut","it","be","completedbr","br","thi","two","mini","be","great","when","origin","broadcast","and","to","that","of","u","who","see","them","then","tug","at","a","nostalg","string","that","remind","u","of","young","dai","imo","thi","mini","doe","not","nearli","live","up","to","it","reput","and","sever","disappoint"],"filtered":["thi","mini","doe","get","well","ag","see","thi","sequel","origin","broadcast","like","mani","blow","awai","earli","borrow","novel","wow","w","r","even","much","impress","decid","see","invest","plu","dvd","set","watch","mini","pain","detail","realiz","thing","backward","purchas","novel","borrow","dvdsbr","br","believ","abysm","miscast","read","novel","see","think","thi","date","screen","somebodi","old","enough","see","origin","broadcast","watch","reaction","get","warn","reaction","peopl","rang","look","horror","belli","laughsbr","br","accord","trivium","section","thi","mini","dan","curti","choos","ali","macgraw","robert","mitchum","yike","product","qualiti","music","score","dialog","great","stori","turn","late","soap","opu","overli","ambiti","producerdirector","wai","hi","head","thi","thing","date","minut","completedbr","br","thi","two","mini","great","origin","broadcast","u","see","tug","nostalg","string","remind","u","young","dai","imo","thi","mini","doe","nearli","live","reput","sever","disappoint"],"filtered2":["mini","doe","get","well","ag","see","sequel","origin","broadcast","like","mani","blow","awai","earli","borrow","novel","wow","w","r","even","impress","decid","see","invest","plu","dvd","set","watch","mini","pain","detail","realiz","thing","backward","purchas","novel","borrow","dvdsbr","believ","abysm","miscast","read","novel","see","think","date","screen","somebodi","old","enough","see","origin","broadcast","watch","reaction","get","warn","reaction","peopl","rang","look","horror","belli","laughsbr","accord","trivium","section","mini","dan","curti","choos","ali","macgraw","robert","mitchum","yike","product","qualiti","music","score","dialog","great","stori","turn","late","soap","opu","overli","ambiti","producerdirector","wai","head","thing","date","minut","completedbr","two","mini","great","origin","broadcast","u","see","tug","nostalg","string","remind","u","young","dai","imo","mini","doe","nearli","live","reput","sever","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,7,12,16,17,18,20,23,29,33,47,50,51,59,67,69,83,91,93,96,109,112,116,118,132,135,145,150,155,187,190,192,208,247,249,266,316,319,387,405,418,432,442,458,474,518,527,539,584,611,644,647,740,749,754,1003,1082,1200,1336,1343,1379,1541,1554,1602,1716,1730,1745,1831,1876,1962,2102,2156,2377,2734,3106,3223,3483,3501,4278,4310,4408,4557,4826,5133,5392,6636,7277,8280],"values":[1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,7,12,16,17,18,20,23,29,33,47,50,51,59,67,69,83,91,93,96,109,112,116,118,132,135,145,150,155,187,190,192,208,247,249,266,316,319,387,405,418,432,442,458,474,518,527,539,584,611,644,647,740,749,754,1003,1082,1200,1336,1343,1379,1541,1554,1602,1716,1730,1745,1831,1876,1962,2102,2156,2377,2734,3106,3223,3483,3501,4278,4310,4408,4557,4826,5133,5392,6636,7277,8280],"values":[0.6460382945576578,3.2785010273469735,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720

{"value":"So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been erratic and disappointing. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares, but at least it was well-directed, suspenseful, and visually interesting, with solid acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini-series.<br /><br />However, the second story in the series was just dreadful, and not in the good way. The screenplay is bad, requiring the shallow, unlikable protagonists to act illogically in order to move the plot, and having characters ramble on endlessly for the purposes of clunky, unnecessary exposition. The acting is overdone and unconvincing, and I felt far more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. The director used a million tricks to try to make the narrative spooky, but with the amateurish acting and writing, the end result looks like a freshman-year film school project, with camera moves for their own sake, and little in the way of plot or tension.<br /><br />If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be sorely let down. I look forward to William H. Macy's installment, and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment.

{"value":"Wow what a great premise for a film : Set it around a film maker with writer`s block who decides to take up tango lessons . Hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker who`s interested in tango. Gosh I wish I had that knack for genius . Yes I`m being sarcastic.<br /><br />It amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made . Come on unless you`re a rabid tango fan ( I do concede they do exist judging by the comments ) or a die hard member of the Sally Potter fan club ( ? ) there`s nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it . Even if you`re into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road <br /><br />Coming soon THE REVIEW LESSON where a failed screenwriter from Scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films he`s seen . Gasp in shock as Theo Robertson puts the boot into the latest Hollywood blockbusters , weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company , fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body .

{"value":"What The Bleep Do We Know is a deluded and haphazard look at the mysteries of the universe. We are presented with a parade of apparent experts (none of whom are named) who ramble and pontificate in a thoroughly unscientific manner. Their interviews are chopped up into aggravatingly small segments and dispersed throughout some flashy cgi and banal mini-plots.<br /><br />The film pilfers themes from science, philosophy, theology and politics, minces them together without any regard for accuracy, and then somehow extracts a few prosaic and absurd conclusions. We are led to believe that quantum physics is telling us the purpose of our existence, and any other difficult to answer question the film-makers would like to point their finger at.<br /><br />It is riddled errors and logical non-sequiturs. How did we start at quantum mechanics and end up with this pseudo-scientific spirituality and mysticism? It's like saying 'two plus two equals four, therefore I can move objects with my mind'.<br /><br />There is nothing original in this film, and almost nothing that is accurate. Any discriminating viewer will be annoyed by heavy-handed editing, intrusive and pointless special effects and general lack of substance. Educated viewers will be frustrated to tears by the violence done to science and every other subject this film touches

{"value":"If you made a genre flick in the late 80s, you basically had a 50/50 chance it would either be set underwater or in a prison (sadly, we never got an underwater prison flick). Framed for murder by mafia boss Moretti (Anthony Franciosa), Derek Keillor (Dennis Cole) ends up on death row, right alongside the mob boss' brother Frankie (Frank Sarcinello Jr.). But this is the least of Derek's problems as rogue government agent (and mob stoolie) Col. Burgess (John Saxon, who also directs) is using the prison as a testing ground for a new supervirus. This is the only flick Saxon directed during his storied career. For a guy who has worked with tons of directors, it appears the only ones he picked up any tips from were the cheap-o Italian ones. Sure, it is low budget, but that can't excuse the stilted staging, shooting gaffes, or clumsy exposition in the first 15 minutes. To his credit, Saxon did make it slightly gory and he works in a hilarious nude scene (our lead falls asleep during a prison riot only to fantasize about a female scientist). Cole, who looks like a more rugged Jan-Michael Vincent, is decent as the stoic lead and Franciosa - sporting a really bad rug - gives it his all as the cliché mob boss.

{"value":"\"The Return of Chandu\" is notable, if one can say that, for the casting of Bela Lugosi as the hero rather than the villain. Why he even gets the girl.<br /><br /> The story as such, involves the Black Magic Cult of Ubasti trying to capture the last Egyptian princess Nadji (the delectable Maria Alba) and use her as a sacrifice as a means of reviving their ancient leader who just happens to look like Nadji. Lugosi as Chandu, who possesses magical powers, tries to thwart the villains.<br /><br /> Director Ray Taylor does his best with limited resources and extensive stock footage. Fans of King Kong (1933) will recognize the giant doors that were used to keep Kong at bay in several scenes. The acting is for the most part, awful. The actor who plays the high priest (I believe Lucien Prival) for example, uses that acting coach inspired pronunciation that was so common in the early talkies. The less said about the others the better.<br /><br /> It is a mystery why Lugosi accepted parts in independent quickies at this stage of his career, because he was still a bankable star at Universal at this time. Maybe it was because in this case he got to play the hero and get the girl, who knows. As his career started to spiral downwards in the late 30s, this kind of fare would become the norm for Lugosi rather than the exception.<br /><br

{"value":"How do comments like the one that was the headline by high school girls even make it on this site, this was the stupidest movie I have ever seen, it was ridiculous, how can any moron sit there and say that just because a movie makes you jump it is a good movie, that might be the most idiotic thing I have ever heard, I could sneak up behind you and go \"Boo\" and it would make you jump, but that does not mean I am qualified to write or direct a movie, not to mention \"they tied everything together at the end\" is not a good reason for a movie to be well received. What kind of movie would it be if they didn't tie everything together, I guess that would make it half a movie, not a whole movie. So basically this idiot girl is complimenting them for finishing the movie, well I love how the youth of today hold the media and production companies to such a high standard. No wonder the political system of this country can get away with whatever they want, we have idiots like that coming up in our country, what would happen if this girl actually ends up leading something someday, that is a scary thought.

{"value":"I found this film embarrassing to watch. I felt like it was shoving the storyline down my throat as if I couldn't pick up the subtleties I needed a voice over to spell them all out for me constantly.<br /><br />Having a father who IS still an alcoholic, I didn't really feel it was a film about alcoholism as such. Alcoholics, true alcoholics are very lonely people inside, in my opinion of course. They find it hard to communicate, something that the main character had no problem with really, except he DID have a problem saying I love you at one point- which was a bit of a feeble effort at establishing his cold character. He was constantly surrounded with people too!? <br /><br />I felt cheated that at no point were we really alone with the character to really get a sense of his inner loneliness and turmoil. I couldn't connect with the character and felt no link at all considering my father. I felt nothing at all when it had finished, just relief it was over.<br /><br />Kevin McKidd is an okay actor but not a tough guy feature lead! The clockwork orange thing was as subtle as a brick. McKidd was too old for the teen, they should have got three different characters or avoided the teen stage and concentrated more on the adult McKidd.<br /><br />On a good note, I felt the little boy

{"value":"I was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that The Scott brothers were involved. Unfortunately my hopes were dashed! Yet again we are led to believe that the KGB are a group of inept morons who don't have a clue what they are doing. At one point there is a laughable scene where 4 KGB agents couldn't handle one CIA agent. I grow weary of these biased, one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the Spy game that went on during the cold war. I find it laughable that the US is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in WW2 and beyond. Just like the pathetic U-571, where we are led to believe that the US obtained the Enigma machine, again, utterly false.<br /><br />To its credit, \"The Company\" is very well filmed and acted. The locales are also exceptionally well realised. Alfred Molina puts in a great performance as does Keaton (The conflict between them is very well done). I really wanted to like this show and no doubt I will end up watching the other 2 episodes but I really wish that US productions would stop trying to portray their Spies, servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet.

{"value":"I do not fail to recognize Haneke's above-average film-making skills. For example, I appreciate his lingering on unremarkable-natural-day-lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. However, regarding the content of this film, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination-submission relations or feelings (and/or BDSM practices). The problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by Walter (I don't mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way, which is understandable; I mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy, or as if he was a monk, come on!). I mean D/s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something \"freakish\" or pathological; it isn't. In general, films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times.<br /><br />So, for me, I feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film, worried with very outdated

{"value":"I'm surprised this movie is rated so highly, although if I were to go with typical grade scale 71 is a c- or d so perhaps that's all right but this movie was just a typical thriller except boringly slow and unrealistic. Not that a typical thriller is realistic but this one seemed to be trying to, and yet the woman who got rapped didn't press charges because she didn't want to be cross examined in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and raped her away for life not but also protecting the lawyer whom she had feelings for and his family not just random people she didn't even know. There were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill/beat Kady before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since Kady ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for Kady to actually rape his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd.

{"value":"First of all this movie starts out on a really dumb note: A 10-year-old girl, playing around in a moving vehicle, decides it would be funny to cover up her mom's eyes with her hands, and then causes a horrific accident which kills the mom....duh....I am sorry, there is positively no 10-year-old that dumb. The rest of the movie does not get much better. After the death of the mother by the apparent dumbest 10-year-old on the planet, the dad moves the family to Genova, Italy, where he is to teach at a local university, but here is the clincher: he does not speak a word of Italian! Then the little girl has \"visions\" of mommy (who she killed), and often subsequent night terrors which always, always end by the father holding and coddling her. Then we are forced to watch this family continually get lost and then found and then hug and then cry and lost and then found (followed by of course more hugging and crying) to the point that I was actually wishing for some sort of natural disaster to just wipe all of these vapid, ignorant people off the planet. Do not get me wrong, because I love indies, but an indie about dumb people (and I mean really dumb) is simply ridiculous and pointless. It is really a shame that this movie was based on such insipid characters wallowing in such retarded scenarios, because the locale was interesting.","finished_norm":["of","all","thi","movi","start","out","on","a","realli","dumb","note","a","yearold","girl","plai","around","in","a","move","vehicl","decid","it","would","be","funni","to","cover","up","her","mom","ey","with","her","hand","and","then","caus","a","horrif","accid","which","kill","the","momduhi","be","sorri","there","be","posit","no","yearold","that","dumb","the","rest","of","the","movi","doe","not","get","much","well","after","the","death","of","the","mother","by","the","appar","dumb","yearold","on","the","planet","the","dad","move","the","famili","to","genova","itali","where","he","be","to","teach","at","a","local","univers","but","here","be","the","clincher","he","doe","not","speak","a","word","of","italian","then","the","littl","girl","have","vision","of","mommi","who","she","kill","and","often","subsequ","night","terror","which","alwai","alwai","end","by","the","father","hold","and","coddl","her","then","we","be","forc","to","watch","thi","famili","continu","get","lose","and","then","find","and","then","hug","and","then","cry","and","lose","and","then","find","follow","by","of","cours","much","hug","and","cry","to","the","point","that","i","be","actual","wish","for","some","sort","of","natur","disast","to","just","wipe","all","of","thi","vapid","ignor","peopl","off","the","planet","do","not","get","me","wrong","becaus","i","love","indi","but","a","indi","about","dumb","peopl","and","i","mean","realli","dumb","be","simpli","ridicul","and","pointless","it","be","realli","a","shame","that","thi","movi","be","base","on","such","insipid","charact","wallow","in","such","retard","scenario","becaus","the","local","be","interest"],"filtered":["thi","movi","start","realli","dumb","note","yearold","girl","plai","around","move","vehicl","decid","funni","cover","mom","ey","hand","caus","horrif","accid","kill","momduhi","sorri","posit","yearold","dumb","rest","movi","doe","get","much","well","death","mother","appar","dumb","yearold","planet","dad","move","famili","genova","itali","teach","local","univers","clincher","doe","speak","word","italian","littl","girl","vision","mommi","kill","often","subsequ","night","terror","alwai","alwai","end","father","hold","coddl","forc","watch","thi","famili","continu","get","lose","find","hug","cry","lose","find","follow","cours","much","hug","cry","point","actual","wish","sort","natur","disast","wipe","thi","vapid","ignor","peopl","planet","get","wrong","becaus","love","indi","indi","dumb","peopl","mean","realli","dumb","simpli","ridicul","pointless","realli","shame","thi","movi","base","insipid","charact","wallow","retard","scenario","becaus","local","interest"],"filtered2":["start","realli","dumb","note","yearold","girl","plai","around","move","vehicl","decid","funni","cover","mom","ey","hand","caus","horrif","accid","kill","momduhi","sorri","posit","yearold","dumb","rest","doe","get","well","death","mother","appar","dumb","yearold","planet","dad","move","famili","genova","itali","teach","local","univers","clincher","doe","speak","word","italian","littl","girl","vision","mommi","kill","often","subsequ","night","terror","alwai","alwai","end","father","hold","coddl","forc","watch","famili","continu","get","lose","find","hug","cry","lose","find","follow","cours","hug","cry","point","actual","wish","sort","natur","disast","wipe","vapid","ignor","peopl","planet","get","wrong","becaus","love","indi","indi","dumb","peopl","mean","realli","dumb","simpli","ridicul","pointless","realli","shame","base","insipid","charact","wallow","retard","scenario","becaus","local","interest"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,10,13,14,18,20,22,23,24,25,38,40,52,54,60,62,66,71,76,84,88,98,182,197,199,201,210,221,226,235,245,249,258,260,269,274,275,281,308,334,338,343,344,397,399,400,414,420,433,437,452,456,475,491,509,531,560,574,762,856,913,1007,1016,1030,1034,1112,1121,1325,1423,1448,1510,1569,1575,1645,2074,2109,2552,2773,3181,3819,3943,4781,6031,6508],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,7,10,13,14,18,20,22,23,24,25,38,40,52,54,60,62,66,71,76,84,88,98,182,197,199,201,210,221,226,235,245,249,258,260,269,274,275,281,308,334,338,343,344,397,399,400,414,420,433,437,452,456,475,491,509,531,560,574,762,856,913,1007,1016,1030,1034,1112,1121,1325,1423,1448,1510,1569,1575,1645,2074,2109,2552,2773,3181,3819,3943,4781,6031,6508],"values":[2.389902141215977,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,3.3953824709201923,1.1175081997259209,2.430631986809635,1.165345040023057,2.5958480334723544,2.729695454751562,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,3.038623282696244,1.6284968758320737,1.7122153074726136,1.8113893252729412

{"value":"I was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find, so when I stumbled upon it on Ebay I forked over the $10 and bought it, now I understand why its so rare! This film is SO bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits, which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines, are literally the movie's highlight. The film is about a psychic (Pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, her topless scene) whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. When she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it, and gee, what do you know? SURPRISE! A kid in a foam-rubber monster costume pops out, instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face, then escapes to a nearby city. But rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to Pettyjohn and Ray to find it on their own, but no matter, this movie blows all its credibility LONG before then.

{"value":"Normally when I go on a raid of the local Hollywood Video I head towards the B-Horror movies. To me the basic principals behind a B-Horror movie is it's camp value, Heavy Gore, Lots of needless Nudity, and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex. I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because I've been a fan of the band since they released they're first Demo in 1995. The movie started off on an interesting note and then when I saw Dani Filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask I LAUGHED. When I saw the Lesbian sex scene for the sake of a Lesbian sex scene I LAUGHED EVEN HARDER. I spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when I wasn't laughing I was shaking my head thinking about how a multi-million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi-hundreds of dollars. The whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the \"Hardcore Goth kids who think death, destruction, sex, blood, and Satan are the greatest things invented since Lava Lamps. That was really it. To me this movie seemed like 80.5% of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being Satanic. This movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this \"Movie\" really is just an extended Cradle of Filth

{"value":"This movie was way over-hyped. A lot of the viewers, who thought this was \"amazing\" must have been into the old school movies, cause the whole movie is set in the past. At first I thought the movie was just showing something from the past, so I was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass, but it just going. Basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past, and the 2 don't mix very well in this movie, even with special effects. You could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with. There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did, so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying \"it's the greatest movie ever done\". It's just crap on a stick. It also didn't help that the story line was sooo crappy. I don't understand why Hollywood agreed to have this movie produced, and I also don't understand how actors/actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this. It's almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print...\"It will all be done on a computer\". This was a movie that should have been on a movie network, because nothing about this movie was revolutionary. I'm very upset with myself for paying money to see this. Whatever you do, don't waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","wai","overhyp","a","lot","of","the","viewer","who","think","thi","be","amaz","must","have","be","into","the","old","school","movi","caus","the","whole","movi","be","set","in","the","past","at","i","think","the","movi","be","just","show","someth","from","the","past","so","i","be","expect","that","fade","dreami","like","light","on","the","charact","to","pass","but","it","just","go","basic","thi","be","a","movi","try","to","mix","the","futur","with","the","past","and","the","do","not","mix","veri","good","in","thi","movi","even","with","special","effect","you","can","actual","see","the","blue","screen","the","actor","be","work","with","there","be","too","mani","movi","out","there","that","do","exactli","what","thi","movi","do","so","there","be","no","reason","for","critic","to","hyp","thi","movi","up","sai","it","the","great","movi","ever","do","it","just","crap","on","a","stick","it","conjur","do","not","help","that","the","stori","line","be","sooo","crappi","i","do","not","understand","why","hollywood","agre","to","have","thi","movi","produc","and","i","conjur","do","not","understand","how","actorsactress","in","thi","movi","be","will","to","be","in","a","movi","like","thi","it","almost","a","though","everybodi","read","the","script","and","forget","to","read","the","fine","printit","will","all","be","do","on","a","comput","thi","be","a","movi","that","should","have","be","on","a","movi","network","becaus","noth","about","thi","movi","be","revolutionari","i","be","veri","upset","with","myself","for","pai","monei","to","see","thi","whatev","you","do","do","not","wast","your","time","and","monei","on","thi","movi","todai","or","tomorrow"],"filtered":["thi","movi","wai","overhyp","lot","viewer","think","thi","amaz","must","old","school","movi","caus","whole","movi","set","past","think","movi","show","someth","past","expect","fade","dreami","like","light","charact","pass","go","basic","thi","movi","try","mix","futur","past","mix","veri","good","thi","movi","even","special","effect","actual","see","blue","screen","actor","work","mani","movi","exactli","thi","movi","reason","critic","hyp","thi","movi","sai","great","movi","ever","crap","stick","conjur","help","stori","line","sooo","crappi","understand","hollywood","agre","thi","movi","produc","conjur","understand","actorsactress","thi","movi","movi","like","thi","almost","though","everybodi","read","script","forget","read","fine","printit","comput","thi","movi","movi","network","becaus","noth","thi","movi","revolutionari","veri","upset","pai","monei","see","thi","whatev","wast","time","monei","thi","movi","todai","tomorrow"],"filtered2":["wai","overhyp","lot","viewer","think","amaz","must","old","school","caus","whole","set","past","think","show","someth","past","expect","fade","dreami","like","light","charact","pass","go","basic","try","mix","futur","past","mix","veri","good","even","special","effect","actual","see","blue","screen","actor","work","mani","exactli","reason","critic","hyp","great","ever","crap","stick","conjur","help","stori","line","sooo","crappi","understand","hollywood","agre","produc","conjur","understand","actorsactress","like","almost","though","everybodi","read","script","forget","read","fine","printit","comput","network","becaus","noth","revolutionari","veri","upset","pai","monei","see","whatev","wast","time","monei","todai","tomorrow"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,8,10,12,15,17,22,28,33,36,39,41,44,48,49,50,51,52,53,67,72,77,86,89,95,106,107,109,111,126,130,131,141,145,185,192,203,212,261,279,286,296,300,313,322,353,372,416,440,452,462,464,487,557,579,622,685,765,782,789,844,1040,1077,1215,1589,1791,1827,2164,3406,4350,5671,6115,7059,7751],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,6,8,10,12,15,17,22,28,33,36,39,41,44,48,49,50,51,52,53,67,72,77,86,89,95,106,107,109,111,126,130,131,141,145,185,192,203,212,261,279,286,296,300,313,322,353,372,416,440,452,462,464,487,557,579,622,685,765,782,789,844,1040,1077,1215,1589,1791,1827,2164,3406,4350,5671,6115,7059,7751],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.133457220525776,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,1.2979240167361772,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,3.1077880109725475,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,1.9570915389266579,1.9209463754160525,1.9463902258768238,2.031112399272319,1.9940046109572438,2.0323326556775485,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955

{"value":"Anyone notice that Tommy only has 3 facial expressions.<br /><br />1. The angry eyes look he gives every enemy. 2. The holding of the hands to face, mouth agape and frightened eyes. 3. The smiling Tommy Turnbull.<br /><br />I have to say that i pretty much hate this show, i don't watch it but it's like Code Lyoko, we've all watched at least one, i must say that this show is borderline racist, uninteresting and pointless.<br /><br />every episode ends with robotboy winning, except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack.<br /><br />The jokes are pretty crude too, i think it's mostly people saying the word \"Suck\" or farting, i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too.<br /><br />Isn't there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate, and the other uses a chain, for god sake, what kind of school is he going to. Not to mention his older brother, who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities.<br /><br />The whole show i feel is ripping off megas XLR and Fosters. Like you could say the trio of coop, jamie and Kiva, as well as Robotboy being similar to Megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he's free spirited despite being a robot.<br /><br

{"value":"I saw this movie the first time at about twelve o'clock on a Saturday evening. It really is the perfect time for this one. I have never, EVER seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes. If you want to see a thrilling action movie, don't watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through. However, if you want a good laugh, please watch it! I even bought the Chuck Norris 3DVD collection thanks to my enjoyable Saturday night. What especially struck me is that évery scene that would be expensive to make was copy-pasted from a Discovery documentary or an old TV-special on the US Army. Furthermore I was amazed by the fact that they didn't put the slightest effort in making the production look real. Afghanistan is, as far as I can remember, nowhere near any sea and yet with a single click Deke escapes from the terrorists sand-castle with his jet-pack and is taken away by a submarine (probably Discovery). Later on in the movie, Deke throws an Islam terrorist against the wall. In the slow motion scene you can beautifully see the long hairs of the Korean stuntman flap in the air when smashed against the wall. Gotta love it. I recommend you watch it with some friends and a good amount of beer though, only then you'll understand why I've been mad enough to spend 6,99 euro's on the

{"value":"Judging from this film and THE STRONG MAN, made the same year, I would not place Harry Langdon at the top of the list of great silent screen comedians. There simply is not enough there. Perhaps he was on his way to developing his style but sabotaged himself by taking his first big successes too seriously. In any event, all of his tricks are reminiscent of the greater funny men, but he lacks the acrobatic skills of Keaton and the prodigious ingenuity of Lloyd. He also undermines his own persona by dressing and walking like Chaplin's tramp character. His trademarks are childlike innocence, timidity of approach and a tendency to under-react to calamity by looking perplexed, batting his eyes or touching his pursed lips with the tip of his forefinger. The comedy in Langdon's films results from fate throwing various obstacles in his path which he tries to overcome in wimpy or naïve ways or with a minimum of physicality, such as throwing rocks at an approaching tornado to drive it away, propping up a collapsing building with a two-by-four or dodging boulders by lifting a leg so that they roll under him. In this story, about the son of a shoemaker who joins a cross-country walking race to publicize a rival company's footwear, he manages to win by sheer luck. There is nothing here that hasn't been done far better by the Big

{"value":"There are similarities between Ray Lawrence's \"Jindabyne\" and his last movie \"Lantana\"  a dead body and its repercussions for already dysfunctional lives. But whereas \"Lantana\" offered some hope and resolution, \"Jindabyne\" leaves everything unresolved in a bleak way that will leave most viewers unsatisfied, perhaps even cheated.<br /><br />The storyline - the aftermath of a fisherman's discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river - is based on a short story by Raymond Carver. It became an element in Robert Altman's classic 1993 ensemble \"Short Cuts\". Lawrence uses this theme for an exploration and exposition of relationships within a small Australian community under stress. The movie poses some moral questions \"Would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend?\" and more poignantly for Australians \"Would it make any difference if the dead person was an aboriginal?\" The acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music, not unlike \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\".<br /><br />If all this sounds like the basis for a great movie - be prepared for a let down, the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning, thereby eliminating the element of mystery. And so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale.","finished_norm":["there","be","similar","between","rai","lawrenc","jindabyn","and","hi","last","movi","lantana","a","dead","bodi","and","it","repercuss","for","alreadi","dysfunct","live","but","wherea","lantana","offer","some","hope","and","resolut","jindabyn","leav","everyth","unresolv","in","a","bleak","wai","that","will","leav","much","viewer","unsatisfi","perhap","even","cheatedbr","br","the","storylin","the","aftermath","of","a","fisherman","discoveri","of","a","corps","float","in","a","remot","river","be","base","on","a","short","stori","by","raymond","carver","it","becom","a","elem","in","robert","altman","classic","ensembl","short","cut","lawrenc","us","thi","theme","for","a","explor","and","exposit","of","relationship","within","a","small","australian","commun","under","stress","the","movi","pose","some","moral","question","would","you","let","the","discoveri","of","a","dead","bodi","ruin","your","good","weekend","and","much","poignantli","for","australian","would","it","make","ani","differ","if","the","dead","person","be","a","aborigin","the","act","especi","by","gabriel","byrn","and","laura","linnei","be","commend","and","there","be","elem","of","mystic","reinforc","by","haunt","music","not","unlik","picnic","at","hang","rockbr","br","if","all","thi","sound","like","the","basi","for","a","great","movi","be","prepar","for","a","let","down","the","pace","be","veri","slow","and","the","murder","be","show","near","the","begin","therebi","elimin","the","elem","of","mysteri","and","so","we","be","leav","with","thi","desol","live","and","a","blank","final"],"filtered":["similar","rai","lawrenc","jindabyn","hi","last","movi","lantana","dead","bodi","repercuss","alreadi","dysfunct","live","wherea","lantana","offer","hope","resolut","jindabyn","leav","everyth","unresolv","bleak","wai","leav","much","viewer","unsatisfi","perhap","even","cheatedbr","br","storylin","aftermath","fisherman","discoveri","corps","float","remot","river","base","short","stori","raymond","carver","becom","elem","robert","altman","classic","ensembl","short","cut","lawrenc","us","thi","theme","explor","exposit","relationship","within","small","australian","commun","stress","movi","pose","moral","question","let","discoveri","dead","bodi","ruin","good","weekend","much","poignantli","australian","make","ani","differ","dead","person","aborigin","act","especi","gabriel","byrn","laura","linnei","commend","elem","mystic","reinforc","haunt","music","unlik","picnic","hang","rockbr","br","thi","sound","like","basi","great","movi","prepar","let","pace","veri","slow","murder","show","near","begin","therebi","elimin","elem","mysteri","leav","thi","desol","live","blank","final"],"filtered2":["similar","rai","lawrenc","jindabyn","last","lantana","dead","bodi","repercuss","alreadi","dysfunct","live","wherea","lantana","offer","hope","resolut","jindabyn","leav","everyth","unresolv","bleak","wai","leav","viewer","unsatisfi","perhap","even","cheatedbr","storylin","aftermath","fisherman","discoveri","corps","float","remot","river","base","short","stori","raymond","carver","becom","elem","robert","altman","classic","ensembl","short","cut","lawrenc","us","theme","explor","exposit","relationship","within","small","australian","commun","stress","pose","moral","question","let","discoveri","dead","bodi","ruin","good","weekend","poignantli","australian","make","ani","differ","dead","person","aborigin","act","especi","gabriel","byrn","laura","linnei","commend","elem","mystic","reinforc","haunt","music","unlik","picnic","hang","rockbr","sound","like","basi","great","prepar","let","pace","veri","slow","murder","show","near","begin","therebi","elimin","elem","mysteri","leav","desol","live","blank","final"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,15,17,21,27,28,33,51,56,74,115,116,118,124,144,147,153,156,178,181,193,204,228,267,272,273,279,303,318,330,332,334,363,376,378,390,403,479,507,515,534,539,546,555,577,589,615,672,710,848,878,883,1061,1262,1291,1295,1463,1565,1571,1665,1939,2032,2040,2118,2362,2427,2457,2648,2786,2823,2932,2968,3027,3130,3149,3554,3568,3572,3665,3878,4481,4897,5054,5853,6055,7401,7841,7955,8013,8198],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,15,17,21,27,28,33,51,56,74,115,116,118,124,144,147,153,156,178,181,193,204,228,267,272,273,279,303,318,330,332,334,363,376,378,390,403,479,507,515,534,539,546,555,577,589,615,672,710,848,878,883,1061,1262,1291,1295,1463,1565,1571,1665,1939,2032,2040,2118,2362,2427,2457,2648,2786,2823,2932,2968,3027,3130,3149,3554,3568,3572,3665,3878,4481,4897,5054,5853,6055,7401,7841,7955,8013,8198],"values":[0

{"value":"Goodnight, Mister Tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II. Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with reluctant, gruff old Tom (who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold) our tale begins.<br /><br />And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is. In fact it's just the old odd-couple buddy formula. Aren't any new stories being written?<br /><br />As I suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in London apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around. And certainly no hint of the horror of the Blitz as London's citizens file politely into air-raid shelters. Even when the local schoolteacher's husband is declared missing presumed killed, he is later restored to life.<br /><br />I found `Goodnight, Mister Tom' cliched and obvious and John Thaw's accent

{"value":"Goodnight, Mister Tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine. Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II. Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with reluctant, gruff old Tom (who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold) our tale begins.<br /><br />And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is. In fact it's just the old odd-couple buddy formula. Aren't any new stories being written?<br /><br />As I suggested there's hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in London apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around. And certainly no hint of the horror of the Blitz as London's citizens file politely into air-raid shelters. Even when the local schoolteacher's husband is declared missing presumed killed, he is later restored to life.<br /><br />I found `Goodnight, Mister Tom' cliched and obvious and John Thaw's accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his `country bumpkin' accent.<br /><br />Incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I disliked it and looking at fellow-imdb reviewers I seem to be in a minority of one.<br /><br

{"value":"A terrible movie containing a bevy of D-list Canadian actors who seem so self-conscious about the fact they are on-camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable.<br /><br />This film is badly written, badly edited, and badly directed. It is disjointed, incomprehensible and bizarre - but not in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he is given, but is the only one in this film to do so - he really has a bad story and script to work with. It's not even camp enough to be funny.<br /><br />I have yet to see Van Pelleske act in a credible manner, and even the sub-characters like Eisen (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge off Africa.<br /><br />Didn't the director see that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? The fight between the blue bolts of lightning and Pelleske's orange wisps of 'magic' (!?! for lack of a better word), is obviously the result of bad actors, with no choreographer, overlaid with completely derivative special effects. Was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film (not the good kind)? <br /><br />Learn from the mistakes of others ... don't even waste your time with this one, you'll regret it like I did.

{"value":"this movie is made for Asian/Chinese market, targeting particularly fans of Jay Chou, one of the biggest music star in Asian.<br /><br />Jay Chou is a very talented song writer/singer. He is mediocre as an actor, although he did appear in several big-budget productions (\"initial D\", \"Curse of the Golden Flower \"). Amazingly, he won both golden horse (taiwan) and Hong Kong film awards for \"initial D\".<br /><br />The supporting cast are very well chosen, which appeals basically everyone from China. The cast including many famous movie/TV actors, singers, even sport commentator (Huang Jianxiang from China). However, they were not given enough time to show their talents.<br /><br />The biggest mistake is that Chu took over both director and writer position. He has a reputation of making shallow and brainless movies based off non-coherent scripts. With his poor directing and lam story, the whole talented cast, fancy vision effects and tones of production money was wasted.<br /><br />However, the terrible movie successfully cashed in over 10 million dollars, maybe even more in Asian, which made this one of the biggest box office success in Asian.<br /><br />The bottom line is: you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and

{"value":"I won't argue with anyone who pronounces this film execrable, as is January Jones's performance, but please check her out, if you haven't already, in the AMC TV series 'Mad Men,\" starting later this month. She's excellent, as is the entire cast. I'll charitably assume she took on the \"Taboo\" role strictly for the money, and, realizing what a putrid mess it was going to be, turned in a minimal acting job to avoid starvation. Don't know if that's the case, but I (now) know for sure that she can act.<br /><br />At first, watching \"Taboo,\" I was convinced her flat delivery was a shrewd choice that would later give rise to some significant revelation about her character or the plot. No such luck. Hard to believe the director didn't suggest to her at least once that not changing expression for 17 successive scenes could cause lockjaw.<br /><br />Ironically, her winning performance in \"Mad Men\" comes as a character who, at least in her early appearances, is very repressed, reserved, unsure of herself, and rather colorless, not unlike her \"Taboo\" role. But as the TV series progressed, she began to blossom into someone who questions her traditional early-60's whitebread Mom role.

{"value":"i went into this hoping it would be the \"thought provoking\" little gem people have reviewed this as. i love indy films and expected to dig this too. knowing what a hot button this topics is i expected to be really entertained, maybe even see an outsiders perspective.<br /><br />all i can say is wow....if your into self torture, or mutilation then maybe you'll like this. personally i don't like the idea of being pee'd on or cutting myself so i thought it was garbage. bad script, bad acting, bad story, bad directing, bad editing....i could go on. i have no clue why a reviewer claimed he or she was making a political point by giving this movie a 10. that's misleading and ignorant. voting for a movie on IMDb isn't setting a precedent! it just lets other people think that a garbage bomb like this is OK to watch as long as it's controversial (this film is not, it tries VERY HARD to be but fails). <br /><br />you know the movie is bad when 15 minutes into it your praying that all main characters die horrifically. unfortunately they do die, but not in the painful manners that would have given the viewer some justice or vindication for having watched the 2 hours of crap they just endured. <br /><br />do yourself a favor, just don't even bother. i got this movie in a bargain bin at my local video store for .50 and feel ripped

{"value":"In the autobiographical coming-of-age tale \"Romulus, My Father,\" Eric Bana, of \"Munich\" fame, plays an impoverished German émigré struggling to raise his son, Raymond (Kodi Smit-McPhee), in rural 1960's Australia. The major obstacle to the family's stability and happiness is his wife, Christina (Franka Potente), who flagrantly violates her wedding vows by shamelessly shacking up with other men. Despite her highly unconventional behavior, Romulus refuses to grant her a divorce, masochistically torturing himself in the vain hope that she will one day return to him. It is, unfortunately, the good-hearted and good-natured Raimond who must bear witness to all this marital turmoil - and it is his memoir that serves as the basis for the movie (Raimond Gaita would later grow up to be an author).<br /><br />Even though I admire \"Romulus, My Father\" for what it is trying to do, I can't honestly say I enjoyed it, for while the film has some fine performances and serious intentions going for it, these simply aren't enough to counteract the dour storyline and funereal pacing, which leave the audience as despairing and depressed as the people on screen. A serious slice-of-life drama is one thing, but this unremittingly downbeat wallow in adultery, insanity and multiple suicides (let alone attempted suicides) is something else

{"value":"What made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to Charlotte Bronte's brilliance of the original classic story. I was deeply disappointed to find that this movie, which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste, had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful. Much of the witty back and forth between the main characters, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester, seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor. Also missing was Jane Eyre's charismatic sense of self, which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all. The original Jane Eyre was a hero. The woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over, including one of the greatest parts of the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield and Mr. Rochester. Her struggle to find food and shelter, her shame at having to beg for bread, the threat of freezing to death in the cold, all to get away from a man she loved were, in my opinion, poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie. The title character seemed dry and uninspired. The story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book, I cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting. The screenplay and Direction did little if any credit to the classic story.","finished_norm":["what","make","the","idea","of","see","thi","movi","so","attract","be","the","hope","that","it","would","live","up","to","charlott","bront","brillianc","of","the","origin","classic","stori","i","be","deepli","disappoint","to","find","that","thi","movi","which","seem","to","be","either","write","or","film","in","great","hast","have","not","the","qualiti","that","make","the","origin","novel","so","power","much","of","the","witti","back","and","forth","between","the","main","charact","jane","eyr","and","mr","rochest","seem","to","be","either","miss","from","the","screenplai","or","leav","on","the","cut","room","floor","conjur","miss","be","jane","eyr","charismat","sens","of","self","which","enabl","her","to","suffer","through","her","turmoil","and","triumph","over","all","the","origin","jane","eyr","be","a","hero","the","woman","in","thi","movi","do","not","seem","to","have","much","to","triumph","over","includ","on","of","the","great","part","of","the","stori","when","jane","run","awai","from","thornfield","and","mr","rochest","her","struggl","to","find","food","and","shelter","her","shame","at","have","to","beg","for","bread","the","threat","of","freez","to","death","in","the","cold","all","to","get","awai","from","a","man","she","love","be","in","my","opinion","poignant","part","of","the","stori","that","be","simpli","leav","out","of","thi","movi","the","titl","charact","seem","spindri","and","uninspir","the","stori","be","unapp","and","for","that","who","do","not","read","the","book","i","cannot","imagin","that","thi","stori","would","be","the","littl","bite","interest","the","screenplai","and","direct","do","littl","if","ani","credit","to","the","classic","stori"],"filtered":["make","idea","see","thi","movi","attract","hope","live","charlott","bront","brillianc","origin","classic","stori","deepli","disappoint","find","thi","movi","seem","either","write","film","great","hast","qualiti","make","origin","novel","power","much","witti","back","forth","main","charact","jane","eyr","mr","rochest","seem","either","miss","screenplai","leav","cut","room","floor","conjur","miss","jane","eyr","charismat","sens","self","enabl","suffer","turmoil","triumph","origin","jane","eyr","hero","woman","thi","movi","seem","much","triumph","includ","great","part","stori","jane","run","awai","thornfield","mr","rochest","struggl","find","food","shelter","shame","beg","bread","threat","freez","death","cold","get","awai","man","love","opinion","poignant","part","stori","simpli","leav","thi","movi","titl","charact","seem","spindri","uninspir","stori","unapp","read","book","imagin","thi","stori","littl","bite","interest","screenplai","direct","littl","ani","credit","classic","stori"],"filtered2":["make","idea","see","attract","hope","live","charlott","bront","brillianc","origin","classic","stori","deepli","disappoint","find","seem","either","write","great","hast","qualiti","make","origin","novel","power","witti","back","forth","main","charact","jane","eyr","mr","rochest","seem","either","miss","screenplai","leav","cut","room","floor","conjur","miss","jane","eyr","charismat","sens","self","enabl","suffer","turmoil","triumph","origin","jane","eyr","hero","woman","seem","triumph","includ","great","part","stori","jane","run","awai","thornfield","mr","rochest","struggl","find","food","shelter","shame","beg","bread","threat","freez","death","cold","get","awai","man","love","opinion","poignant","part","stori","simpli","leav","titl","charact","seem","spindri","uninspir","stori","unapp","read","book","imagin","stori","littl","bite","interest","screenplai","direct","littl","ani","credit","classic","stori"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,10,14,17,27,35,38,39,45,51,54,60,61,63,65,69,70,74,102,116,123,137,145,151,154,155,173,179,181,187,201,207,245,255,264,301,303,319,332,340,356,357,365,375,474,513,538,574,633,648,703,842,1067,1106,1108,1237,1390,1447,1549,1966,2064,2258,2274,2391,2738,2850,3465,3585,3778,3932,4073,4238,4581,4665,5428,5472,5837,8228],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,6.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,10,14,17,27,35,38,39,45,51,54,60,61,63,65,69,70,74,102,116,123,137,145,151,154,155,173,179,181,187,201,207,245,255,264,301,303,319,332,340,356,357,365,375,474,513,538,574,633,648,703,842,1067,1106,1108,1237,1390,1447,1549,1966,2064,2258,2274,2391,2738,2850,3465,3585,3778,3932,4073,4238,4581,4665,5428,5472,5837,8228],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,2.247774048205673,2.2350163994518417,7.66232216406358,1.3002700588679295,5.852676051596536,3.038623282696244,1.5538940054862738,1.8162961064622165,3.4279798616619646,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591

{"value":"<br /><br />Entrails of a Virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively, applying whatever meaning he wishes to its inexplicable excesses of sex and violence. If this was an intentional characteristic of the film, it would be a work of postmodern brilliance-but of course it isn't. <br /><br />Without getting too much into plot summary, let's take a quick walking tour of the events. At a secluded cabin, an orgy is in progress, which includes topless wrestling and diaper p***ing. A vanload of latecomers joins the orgy in progress, but they have unwittingly been followed by a monster I like to call \"the muddy ninja.\" This monster precedes to slay orgy participants one by one, except the proverbial virgin (if you don't count oral sex) who receives his seed and consequently becomes so passionate with desire that she masturbates with someone's severed hand. <br /><br />Finally she has her guts pulled out, and then there's a scene which seems to imply that she's pregnant with a baby muddy ninja. Got all that? If you're going to rent this movie, it's best if you don't speak Japanese and don't have any subtitles. In a season populated by boring Hollywood flicks, putting this in your VCR might be the cinematic equivalent of shock therapy.
