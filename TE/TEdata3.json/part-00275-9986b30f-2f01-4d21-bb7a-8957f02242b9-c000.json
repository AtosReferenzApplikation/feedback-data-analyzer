{"value":"I got Mirror Mirror mainly because Yvonne De Carlo was in it (I thought she was great in American Gothic) but sadly she didn't have a very big role in this film. It starts off OK and the pace moves along nicely...but by the end it starts getting a bit tedious and dull. That's not to say that this is a boring film, but it's just very average and nothing spectacular. I didn't like the \"posession\" side of it and there were no decent gore scenes. Plus the 'main' story was very confusing and the ending doesn't make much sense at all. I did however like the story surrounding the Gothic girl and how she got revenge on her tormentors.<br /><br />I wouldn't particularly recommend Mirror Mirror to horror fans - it's nothing to wet yourself over.","finished_norm":["i","get","mirror","mirror","mainli","becaus","yvonn","de","carlo","be","in","it","i","think","she","be","great","in","american","gothic","but","sadli","she","do","not","have","a","veri","big","role","in","thi","film","it","start","off","okai","and","the","pace","move","along","nicelybut","by","the","end","it","start","get","a","bite","tediou","and","dull","that","not","to","sai","that","thi","be","a","bore","film","but","it","just","veri","averag","and","noth","spectacular","i","do","not","like","the","posess","side","of","it","and","there","be","no","decent","gore","scene","plu","the","main","stori","be","veri","confus","and","the","end","doe","not","make","much","sens","at","all","i","do","howev","like","the","stori","surround","the","gothic","girl","and","how","she","get","reveng","on","her","tormentorsbr","br","i","would","not","particularli","recommend","mirror","mirror","to","horror","fan","it","noth","to","wet","yourself","over"],"filtered":["get","mirror","mirror","mainli","becaus","yvonn","de","carlo","think","great","american","gothic","sadli","veri","big","role","thi","film","start","okai","pace","move","along","nicelybut","end","start","get","bite","tediou","dull","sai","thi","bore","film","veri","averag","noth","spectacular","like","posess","side","decent","gore","scene","plu","main","stori","veri","confus","end","doe","make","much","sens","howev","like","stori","surround","gothic","girl","get","reveng","tormentorsbr","br","particularli","recommend","mirror","mirror","horror","fan","noth","wet"],"filtered2":["get","mirror","mirror","mainli","becaus","yvonn","de","carlo","think","great","american","gothic","sadli","veri","big","role","start","okai","pace","move","along","nicelybut","end","start","get","bite","tediou","dull","bore","veri","averag","noth","spectacular","like","posess","side","decent","gore","scene","plu","main","stori","veri","confus","end","doe","make","sens","howev","like","stori","surround","gothic","girl","get","reveng","tormentorsbr","particularli","recommend","mirror","mirror","horror","fan","noth","wet"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,12,15,17,18,19,22,24,49,51,71,82,83,84,108,113,128,140,154,173,179,191,223,275,298,309,324,358,367,425,427,497,546,643,705,749,750,871,1211,1235,1275,1853,2829,3298,3929,4766],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,12,15,17,18,19,22,24,49,51,71,82,83,84,108,113,128,140,154,173,179,191,223,275,298,309,324,358,367,425,427,497,546,643,705,749,750,871,1211,1235,1275,1853,2829,3298,3929,4766],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,2.389902141215977,1.066728610262888,3.6001823395697077,2.5541073880211935,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.2979240167361772,2.6420723132238515,3.3840606616174704,1.7139899308309823,3.8429853485101932,2.020196584395323,2.292318797740072,2.2212694515902225,2.138507503627933,2.1521782565202803,2.3409902041158843,2.317169775997098,2.348499626138016,2.4368824319140248,2.507968722980095,2.5460113484259455,2.825563294794476,2.7832848715031413,2.7819920465008363,2.848772527704847,2.8753661172782943,3.2030824725120812,3.0791938792932125,3.226987993365636,3.233054746047873,3.342254038012865,3.4572130107926293,3.5813614403160887,3.6284289511740746,3.7165362186843414,4.030886538218284,3.9954846111673676,4.274508620876034,4.297765483040301,4.3095999406873045,20.206149141666724,5.322690055917252,5.5623629091826725,11.645292014892677,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.362910799668998E-5,7.313260970838802E-5,7.370114601333325E-5,7.327530000650361E-5,7.327650053979544E-5,7.317407463548356E-5,7.339170458608616E-5,7.314314032632325E-5,7.330759276961395E-5,8.133077247407229E-5,0.5411451395037297,7.30250711715554E-5,7.438804791205335E-5,7.544920976125302E-5,7.307832029166347E-5,7.287636334470365E-5,7.469417306748657E-5,7.339858083482206E-5,7.31708620237102E-5,7.323150765877011E-5,7.394006544651152E-5,7.347130025510087E-5,7.355495847650982E-5,7.363420569440932E-5,7.419931039376933E-5,7.381126888911443E-5,7.691415441241165E-5,7.304678085565046E-5,7.304873502810497E-5,7.323380358520693E-5,7.479037093619153E-5,7.339432801383245E-5,7.878259376300928E-5,7.360077542798459E-5,7.312628899161184E-5,7.346381502065415E-5,0.22245253673242207,7.309618357941891E-5,7.28759972079619E-5,7.289490460383017E-5,7.305898217495677E-5,7.382959962939E-5,7.345444040813984E-5,7.31640220841489E-5,0.23072236787181974,7.319210283562774E-5,7.562391295505185E-5,7.451184127194168E-5,7.291302297263884E-5,7.307416521234576E-5,7.304882033876847E-5,7.510468873669966E-5,7.307525241661443E-5,7.288843320202988E-5,7.368848806780637E-5,7.309407466174905E-5,7.860464405211899E-5,7.303383564656891E-5,7.291217977535705E-5,7.326031403406001E-5,7.398699477840821E-5,7.32554674475751E-5,7.28986

{"value":"This movie is the second worst film that I have ever seen (the first being Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot, climax, conflict, or any other major detail required in portraying a story. This 'film' is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith to show off his manly side and, the 'tough guy he really is'. I completely wasted my time watching this film. The best part would have to be the ending credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have cut my thumbs off and thrown them at the producers. Whoever in their right mind gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film, is obviously on the same mental level as him. In conclusion, do not waste your time watching this movie, it could quite possibly be the only thing you

{"value":"I watched this movie also, and altho it is very well done, I found it a heartbreaker and would not recommend this to women who have small children.. The terror on this mother's face when she sees her child about to be run over by a train is truly heartbreaking. And the sad thing is--internally she dies. Eventually she goes back to the Applacian mountains. All the money in the world which she makes from making dolls does not conceal the grief she has. I remember her desperate face as she pulls money out of her clothes to try to have her child healed. I'm surprised this movie takes place in Detroit, because when I watched it I thought for sure the people had come to Cincinnati, Ohio. This also was a route for the poor from the mountains.","finished_norm":["i","watch","thi","movi","conjur","and","altho","it","be","veri","good","do","i","find","it","a","heartbreak","and","would","not","recommend","thi","to","woman","who","have","small","child","the","terror","on","thi","mother","face","when","she","see","her","child","about","to","be","run","over","by","a","train","be","truli","heartbreak","and","the","sad","thing","isintern","she","die","eventu","she","go","back","to","the","applacian","mountain","all","the","monei","in","the","world","which","she","make","from","make","doll","doe","not","conceal","the","grief","she","have","i","rememb","her","desper","face","a","she","pull","monei","out","of","her","cloth","to","try","to","have","her","child","heal","i","be","surpris","thi","movi","take","place","in","detroit","becaus","when","i","watch","it","i","think","for","sure","the","peopl","have","come","to","cincinnati","ohio","thi","conjur","be","a","rout","for","the","poor","from","the","mountain"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","conjur","altho","veri","good","find","heartbreak","recommend","thi","woman","small","child","terror","thi","mother","face","see","child","run","train","truli","heartbreak","sad","thing","isintern","die","eventu","go","back","applacian","mountain","monei","world","make","make","doll","doe","conceal","grief","rememb","desper","face","pull","monei","cloth","try","child","heal","surpris","thi","movi","take","place","detroit","becaus","watch","think","sure","peopl","come","cincinnati","ohio","thi","conjur","rout","poor","mountain"],"filtered2":["watch","conjur","altho","veri","good","find","heartbreak","recommend","woman","small","child","terror","mother","face","see","child","run","train","truli","heartbreak","sad","thing","isintern","die","eventu","go","back","applacian","mountain","monei","world","make","make","doll","doe","conceal","grief","rememb","desper","face","pull","monei","cloth","try","child","heal","surpris","take","place","detroit","becaus","watch","think","sure","peopl","come","cincinnati","ohio","conjur","rout","poor","mountain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,12,15,18,22,23,29,31,34,36,38,39,63,70,119,126,137,146,164,165,180,251,290,293,298,326,343,363,397,455,544,713,716,788,879,1449,1667,1757,3875,4127,4795,4931,6507,7899],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,12,15,18,22,23,29,31,34,36,38,39,63,70,119,126,137,146,164,165,180,251,290,293,298,326,343,363,397,455,544,713,716,788,879,1449,1667,1757,3875,4127,4795,4931,6507,7899],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,3.1077880109725475,1.8729627573220065,2.094675786251684,2.1653408989309972,4.478254137980457,2.2939035841256437,2.326138445979858,2.3930275298746078,2.448847599972298,8.129194437808064,5.3884545854667785,2.8612813773965557,2.9012296278682137,2.7819920465008363,2.942840385588056,2.9705344631698933,3.0349689855553557,3.3176717946075294,3.2787058260741455,3.4222967456864013,3.865219416329466,3.6746621462132825,3.753391311073496,3.8962296530720266,4.566029469634981,9.759374056980045,4.944927550358424,5.907203395474402,5.878215858601149,6.101359409915359,6.137727054086234,13.200701152068694,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.599016946995431E-5,7.547774999216701E-5,7.606451752661212E-5,7.562501593400091E-5,7.562625496474273E-5,7.552054457331542E-5,7.574515325428399E-5,7.54886182949795E-5,7.565834422777188E-5,8.393880289443256E-5,0.3898887391407122,7.536676302164947E-5,7.677344627929129E-5,7.786863636035756E-5,7.542171967902634E-5,7.521328658724147E-5,7.708938793705839E-5,7.575225000339552E-5,7.551722894285702E-5,7.557981929891597E-5,7.631109837908826E-5,7.582730131423027E-5,7.591364220026554E-5,7.599543063532951E-5,7.65786565230391E-5,7.617817170796531E-5,0.336806084867142,7.538916886926069E-5,7.539118570608014E-5,7.558218884872815E-5,7.718867057872595E-5,7.574786080737622E-5,8.130891184506506E-5,7.596092836197377E-5,7.547122658923492E-5,0.019947777459921694,7.539560253418034E-5,7.544015578807016E-5,7.521290870960841E-5,7.52324224081355E-5,7.540176144775403E-5,7.619709025930936E-5,7.580990082327411E-5,7.551016966724484E-5,7.642769740595012E-5,7.553915088298653E-5,0.03916656556601282,7.690120931558384E-5,7.525112177790584E-5,7.541743135895694E-5,7.539127375239705E-5,0.10522447502069021,7.541855342655862E-5,7.522574348816902E-5,7.605145367928462E-5,7.543797924382712E-5,0.04280043808731044,7.537580854671033E-5,7.525025154185267E-5,7.560954940701661E-5,7.635953259187408E-5,7.56045474052491E-5,7.523633007708614E-5,7.541150634867

{"value":"Americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest really fast.<br /><br />I found out an exciting fact from this film: someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule! And guess what, they really would like to be doing something else (the viewer has similar feelings).<br /><br />Surprisingly, when I was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually

{"value":"This movie started out with some semblance of a plot, then abandoned it for an endless series of random characters and encounters that have nothing to do with moving the story forward. It was impossible to remain engaged with this film. This movie is a very cynical pile of garbage made by some people with animation skills but totally lacking in creativity or storytelling ability. It is a shockingly bad effort coming from a major studio. Clearly there are morale and motivation problems at Disney, not to mention a complete lack of oversight and quality control. That management allowed this movie to see the light of day speaks volumes about their incompetence and desperation. This movie joins my very short \"worst movies of all time\" list.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","start","out","with","some","semblanc","of","a","plot","then","abandon","it","for","a","endless","seri","of","random","charact","and","encount","that","have","noth","to","do","with","move","the","stori","forward","it","be","imposs","to","remain","engag","with","thi","film","thi","movi","be","a","veri","cynic","pile","of","garbag","make","by","some","peopl","with","anim","skill","but","total","lack","in","creativ","or","storytel","abil","it","be","a","shockingli","bad","effort","come","from","a","major","studio","clearli","there","be","moral","and","motiv","problem","at","disnei","not","to","mention","a","complet","lack","of","oversight","and","qualiti","control","that","manag","allow","thi","movi","to","see","the","light","of","dai","speak","volum","about","their","incompet","and","desper","thi","movi","join","my","veri","short","wrong","movi","of","all","time","list"],"filtered":["thi","movi","start","semblanc","plot","abandon","endless","seri","random","charact","encount","noth","move","stori","forward","imposs","remain","engag","thi","film","thi","movi","veri","cynic","pile","garbag","make","peopl","anim","skill","total","lack","creativ","storytel","abil","shockingli","bad","effort","come","major","studio","clearli","moral","motiv","problem","disnei","mention","complet","lack","oversight","qualiti","control","manag","allow","thi","movi","see","light","dai","speak","volum","incompet","desper","thi","movi","join","veri","short","wrong","movi","time","list"],"filtered2":["start","semblanc","plot","abandon","endless","random","charact","encount","noth","move","stori","forward","imposs","remain","engag","veri","cynic","pile","garbag","make","peopl","anim","skill","total","lack","creativ","storytel","abil","shockingli","bad","effort","come","major","studio","clearli","moral","motiv","problem","disnei","mention","complet","lack","oversight","qualiti","control","manag","allow","see","light","dai","speak","volum","incompet","desper","join","veri","short","wrong","time","list"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,8,9,10,15,17,23,25,32,34,49,71,103,132,167,183,184,272,275,277,285,319,344,345,353,401,404,494,521,602,682,699,702,788,823,841,847,859,878,901,902,932,943,976,1128,1131,1288,1319,1321,1487,1900,2028,2150,3501,3671,4132],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,8,9,10,15,17,23,25,32,34,49,71,103,132,167,183,184,272,275,277,285,319,344,345,353,401,404,494,521,602,682,699,702,788,823,841,847,859,878,901,902,932,943,976,1128,1131,1288,1319,1321,1487,1900,2028,2150,3501,3671,4132],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.6920303308087352,1.9214926742550966,2.098582041218749,2.253494045787767,2.4609576687888097,4.977025712729459,2.496249838866882,2.8028805344481915,2.7832848715031413,3.1163992333432793,2.808171552082607,2.9056060024680126,2.983093497946387,3.0022328381570844,3.0266839340212486,3.0879275592619675,3.1419947805322432,3.3243163373261977,3.4076979462652486,3.555828138310924,3.6497387377608255,3.5813614403160887,3.6466665387238555,3.753391311073496,3.9081109809587793,4.30366520516749,3.900174431363043,3.9405024767500145,4.067587905068712,3.8962296530720266,3.9201351739255808,4.058285512406398,3.9911462095687695,4.058285512406398,4.251780369798478,4.197121957260614,4.403125998698128,4.403125998698128,4.370968887063596,4.558366596889411,4.828393734102471,4.979216623837056,5.116075806554253,5.719991853386255,5.719991853386255,5.850044981634453]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.665999837716477E-5,6.621049442427209E-5,6.672521788346044E-5,6.633967886368226E-5,6.63407657646303E-5,6.624803463150946E-5,6.644506556871222E-5,6.622002830283687E-5,6.63689150665251E-5,7.363268833051432E-5,0.8636062113015863,6.611313457725252E-5,6.734710344882694E-5,6.830782467810951E-5,6.616134358530066E-5,6.597850217756278E-5,6.762425338204773E-5,6.645129096980762E-5,6.624512609843843E-5,6.630003152979117E-5,0.01975676822721926,6.651712738382464E-5,6.659286722442693E-5,6.666461356986429E-5,6.717623023027473E-5,0.06354464940564779,6.963411003896518E-5,6.61327894059734E-5,6.61345586129649E-5,6.630211014321888E-5,6.771134597282102E-5,6.644744068494097E-5,7.13256986982257E-5,6.663434753016541E-5,6.620477197317216E-5,6.651035063846337E-5,6.613843313720989E-5,6.617751608507944E-5,6.597817069623326E-5,6.599528847766764E-5,6.61438358514253E-5,6.684151316491718E-5,6.6501863347608E-5,6.623893356979776E-5,6.704380606843432E-5,6.626435643446282E-5,6.84659919428228E-5,6.745917957461175E-5,6.601169191468112E-5,6.615758179070459E-5,6.613463584884138E-5,0.0480186119

Old-style real men in action, here.<br /><br />The crashing model plane and car crash must have been impressive on the big screen.<br /><br />The storytelling itself, despite the flashback sequences, plays it straight -- all the narrators are trusted by us (regardless of the 'truth' or 'untruth' of the dialogue), so there's no game with the viewer about narrative structure. This would become a rough template for future retellings, such as \"Fearless\".<br /><br />So all we're left with is individual performance, and at that level, it's best for Wynn's bantering, a virtual one-man show.","finished_norm":["thi","center","on","uniron","notion","of","come","to","grip","with","guilt","br","br","merril","berat","the","distraught","boi","to","stop","hi","whine","about","renni","death","oldstyl","real","man","in","action","herebr","br","the","crash","model","plane","and","car","crash","must","have","be","impress","on","the","big","screenbr","br","the","storytel","itself","despit","the","flashback","sequenc","plai","it","straight","all","the","narrat","be","trust","by","u","regardless","of","the","truth","or","untruth","of","the","dialogu","so","there","no","game","with","the","viewer","about","narr","structur","thi","would","becom","a","rough","templat","for","futur","retel","such","a","fearlessbr","br","so","all","we","re","leav","with","be","individu","perform","and","at","that","level","it","well","for","wynn","banter","a","virtual","oneman","show"],"filtered":["thi","center","uniron","notion","come","grip","guilt","br","br","merril","berat","distraught","boi","stop","hi","whine","renni","death","oldstyl","real","man","action","herebr","br","crash","model","plane","car","crash","must","impress","big","screenbr","br","storytel","despit","flashback","sequenc","plai","straight","narrat","trust","u","regardless","truth","untruth","dialogu","game","viewer","narr","structur","thi","becom","rough","templat","futur","retel","fearlessbr","br","re","leav","individu","perform","level","well","wynn","banter","virtual","oneman","show"],"filtered2":["center","uniron","notion","come","grip","guilt","merril","berat","distraught","boi","stop","whine","renni","death","oldstyl","real","man","action","herebr","crash","model","plane","car","crash","must","impress","big","screenbr","storytel","despit","flashback","sequenc","plai","straight","narrat","trust","u","regardless","truth","untruth","dialogu","game","viewer","narr","structur","becom","rough","templat","futur","retel","fearlessbr","re","leav","individu","perform","level","well","wynn","banter","virtual","oneman","show"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[20,28,34,40,45,68,74,80,82,105,112,115,129,141,245,248,279,282,284,315,349,374,391,418,445,548,758,844,1051,1088,1102,1183,1198,1214,1290,1315,1316,1538,1614,1728,2028,2643,2651,2703,2895,3228,3996,4358,4538,4837,7779,8500],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[20,28,34,40,45,68,74,80,82,105,112,115,129,141,245,248,279,282,284,315,349,374,391,418,445,548,758,844,1051,1088,1102,1183,1198,1214,1290,1315,1316,1538,1614,1728,2028,2643,2651,2703,2895,3228,3996,4358,4538,4837,7779,8500],"values":[1.165345040023057,1.5452294193519092,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,1.8162961064622165,2.0064197866819473,1.9486336368009016,1.9951803900462557,2.020196584395323,2.1765612129984904,2.2466628996789315,2.201553588425805,2.4106958340079214,2.2657547357741192,2.7502029743242886,2.689504733779216,2.7910771187233068,2.918851229218033,3.110998680163279,2.854312708080462,3.0568369721919364,3.4572130107926293,3.109204957709252,3.164467636384302,3.241201430615691,3.459754308221302,3.8240921249056035,3.8690435127678695,4.191816905030921,4.513582994262438,4.390138803171316,8.631140215347616,4.34596758485818,4.456830177669989,4.3336974922663645,4.4637506205145625,4.403125998698128,4.613282354485526,4.662879295624898,4.688631791727313,4.979216623837056,5.243909178064138,5.214056214914456,5.339219357868463,5.3560264761848435,5.501738287366237,5.7959777603641776,5.967828017290836,5.999576715605417,6.1754673820690815,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.199441751478886E-5,6.157637466437495E-5,6.205507226129103E-5,6.169651739267047E-5,6.169752822064542E-5,6.161128740571491E-5,6.179452800699976E-5,6.158524125997454E-5,6.172370733281015E-5,6.847908392132908E-5,0.7537357649785679,6.148582910253504E-5,6.263343161209111E-5,6.352691127685911E-5,6.153066392770261E-5,6.136061972058818E-5,6.289118362368088E-5,6.180031768782936E-5,0.03048782209847332,6.165964500397516E-5,6.225623823349751E-5,6.186154616424118E-5,6.193198491934336E-5,6.199870968685743E-5,6.247451793205942E-5,6.214779379119757E-5,6.476036897872436E-5,6.150410827576589E-5,6.150575365469735E-5,6.166157813376553E-5,6.297218054186704E-5,6.179673688714851E-5,0.06532880670783547,6.197056198887826E-5,6.157105273171168E-5,6.185524372812438E-5,6.150935699822514E-5,6.154570450267939E-5,6.136031143987349E-5,6.137623113556814E-5,6.151438157261665E-5,0.07360000459597303,6.184735046881343E-5,6.160282333380795E-5,6.235136223181877E-5,6.162646683403052E-5,0.07219509704330976,6.273766344984231E-5,6.139148648431774E-5,6.152716542379514E-5,6.150582548477972E-5,6.32368306169149E-5,6.152808083072033E-5,6.13707823287575E-5,6.204441449317155E-5,6.154392883099075E-5,6.61837316049992E-5,6.149320863677184E-5,6.139077652

{"value":"Boy-girl love affair/sequel with songs, only this time she's the punkette and he's the straight arrow. Movie-buffs out there actually like this movie? It has fans? I must say, the mind reels... \"Grease 2\" is a truly lame enterprise that doesn't even have the courage, moxy or sheer gall to take the memory of its predecessor down in flames (like \"Jaws 2\" or \"Exorcist II\"). No, it whimpers along in slow-motion and often just plays dead. It looks and feels cheap, with a large cast lost amidst messy direction and unfocused handling. This was the first time a substantial audience got a glimpse of Michelle Pfeiffer and, although she doesn't embarrass herself, it's a role worth forgetting. A misfire on the lowest of levels.

{"value":"This is without a doubt one of the worst movies EVER, I emphasize, EVER made. What´s worse, my old hero Dolph is in it and he´s starring it. Jesus... The story is actually quite good but the way it´s carried out made even my body hurt. The fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter. The actors, except for Dolph who kinda sucks also, perform so badly you can´t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they´re all friends of the director, who by the way must have been absent most, if not all, of the time.

{"value":"I like the time period, I like the attempt, but watching a movie that looks like I'm looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache. If I played computer games that were this blurry and out of focus, I would upgrade my computer. Could be that this was the look the director was after, but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes. If I hadn't taken someone with me to this film, I was out of there. Even though it was a series and not a movie per say, Band of Brothers accomplished this. They made it look like WWII footage, with just a touch of graininess, but it was still a pleasure to watch. Movies need real people, with real sets, and real locations; Use CGI when it is appropriate, not for an entire film.","finished_norm":["i","like","the","time","period","i","like","the","attempt","but","watch","a","movi","that","look","like","i","be","look","at","it","through","a","coke","bottl","give","me","a","headach","if","i","plai","comput","game","that","be","thi","blurri","and","out","of","focu","i","would","upgrad","my","comput","can","be","that","thi","be","the","look","the","director","be","after","but","not","so","it","hurt","the","ey","and","you","want","to","leav","after","minut","if","i","have","not","take","someon","with","me","to","thi","film","i","be","out","of","there","even","though","it","be","a","seri","and","not","a","movi","per","sai","band","of","brother","accomplish","thi","thei","make","it","look","like","wwii","footag","with","just","a","touch","of","graini","but","it","be","still","a","pleasur","to","watch","movi","ne","real","peopl","with","real","set","and","real","locat","us","cgi","when","it","be","appropri","not","for","a","entir","film"],"filtered":["like","time","period","like","attempt","watch","movi","look","like","look","coke","bottl","give","headach","plai","comput","game","thi","blurri","focu","upgrad","comput","thi","look","director","hurt","ey","want","leav","minut","take","someon","thi","film","even","though","seri","movi","per","sai","band","brother","accomplish","thi","thei","make","look","like","wwii","footag","touch","graini","still","pleasur","watch","movi","ne","real","peopl","real","set","real","locat","us","cgi","appropri","entir","film"],"filtered2":["like","time","period","like","attempt","watch","look","like","look","coke","bottl","give","headach","plai","comput","game","blurri","focu","upgrad","comput","look","director","hurt","ey","want","leav","minut","take","someon","even","though","per","band","brother","accomplish","make","look","like","wwii","footag","touch","graini","still","pleasur","watch","ne","real","peopl","real","set","real","locat","us","cgi","appropri","entir"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,8,16,23,30,31,37,40,56,58,59,64,74,80,86,109,110,139,177,198,281,374,381,619,658,743,745,765,775,863,927,1012,1638,1750,1998,2640,2946,3156,3315,3703,4720,6686],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,7,8,16,23,30,31,37,40,56,58,59,64,74,80,86,109,110,139,177,198,281,374,381,619,658,743,745,765,775,863,927,1012,1638,1750,1998,2640,2946,3156,3315,3703,4720,6686],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.5841531782306313,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,4.786455488116434,1.364847727375781,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,1.8610609350701788,1.865701314626681,1.8693254449200722,1.883428577602134,1.9486336368009016,5.985541170138767,2.031112399272319,2.125691139326857,2.1290479736304078,2.2939035841256437,2.458149992634611,2.5439726117360975,2.832333801361687,3.4572130107926293,3.24941502915308,3.5929222627171646,3.813163054373413,3.7568101178222815,3.6969916226113715,7.931007557910864,3.753391311073496,3.944626193933877,4.251780369798478,4.297765483040301,4.589376833631972,4.706176101378222,4.8796870284900224,5.274680836730892,5.408212229355414,5.626901430320244,5.541743621979936,5.695894301807195,6.214688095222362,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.125534277361308E-5,8.070741900134218E-5,8.133484222558721E-5,8.086488864071867E-5,8.086621352087535E-5,8.075317871453037E-5,8.09933499825948E-5,8.07190403423203E-5,8.090052617059009E-5,8.975471760055235E-5,0.7411395103502448,8.058874201462518E-5,8.209289092060679E-5,8.326396404835508E-5,8.064750648460857E-5,8.042463157280778E-5,8.243072340443195E-5,8.100093844812473E-5,8.074963335213301E-5,8.081656044114158E-5,8.159850806327534E-5,8.108118988104062E-5,8.117351311625789E-5,8.126096847229138E-5,8.188460465774593E-5,8.145637122766634E-5,0.057314745665877354,8.061270030871088E-5,8.06148568872292E-5,0.04127448583734574,8.253688509793044E-5,8.099624513542998E-5,8.694260782156173E-5,8.122407562065616E-5,8.070044360774857E-5,8.107292935327848E-5,8.061957974656427E-5,8.066721998663411E-5,8.042422751295615E-5,8.04450932680092E-5,8.062616539622177E-5,8.147660059924115E-5,8.106258375255146E-5,8.074208495654971E-5,8.172318595201825E-5,8.07730742099691E-5,8.345676236252734E-5,0.06240466944702451,8.046508827145422E-5,8.0642921037312E-5,8.061495103406045E-5,8.288375879116172E-5,8.064412085023814E-5,8.043795158198562E-5,8.13208732161753E-5,8.066489263495476E-5,8.674622672788468E-5,0.0356499683019826,8.046415773886972E-5,8.084835047584296E-5,8.165029816440727E-5,0.05619538325949463,8.044927168980039E-5,8.063658549753624E-5,8.042520025822431E-5,8.228607269558457E-5,8.111802560520329E-5,8.09452323339401E-5,8.087444206990566E-5,8.116924226697278E-5,8.042226621936864E-5,8.087613756469843E-5,8.218789482681031E-5,8.056638738756194E-5,8.25603

{"value":"Let's see, here are the \"highlights\" of The Brain Machine: 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house; 15 establishing shots of a nondescript office building; 5 countdowns by a bland technician; 7 close-ups of a menacing guard; and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high-tech experiment.<br /><br />Various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given on the DVD box of 1977.

Most of the cast seem to be walking through the show - Chynna Phillips has no idea who Kim really is and no wonder people walk over Harry McAfee when it's played by George Wendt who looks like he'd rather be back on a bar stool in Boston. Jason Alexander is passable, but that wig has to go and I saw better dancing in Bugsy Malone. As I mentioned, it's good to have a version of the stage script now, but I hope the young out there, who have never seen a musical, DON'T judge them all by this.","finished_norm":["in","my","humbl","opinion","thi","version","of","the","great","bdwy","music","have","onli","two","thing","go","for","it","tyn","dali","and","the","fact","that","there","be","now","a","film","version","with","the","origin","script","okai","vanessa","william","be","good","to","watchbut","to","me","that","all","there","be","much","of","the","cast","seem","to","be","walk","through","the","show","chynna","phillip","have","no","idea","who","kim","realli","be","and","no","wonder","peopl","walk","over","harri","mcafe","when","it","plai","by","georg","wendt","who","look","like","he","have","rather","be","back","on","a","bar","stool","in","boston","jason","alexand","be","passabl","but","that","wig","have","to","go","and","i","see","well","danc","in","bugsi","malon","a","i","mention","it","good","to","have","a","version","of","the","stage","script","now","but","i","hope","the","young","out","there","who","have","never","see","a","music","don","t","judg","them","all","by","thi"],"filtered":["humbl","opinion","thi","version","great","bdwy","music","onli","two","thing","go","tyn","dali","fact","film","version","origin","script","okai","vanessa","william","good","watchbut","much","cast","seem","walk","show","chynna","phillip","idea","kim","realli","wonder","peopl","walk","harri","mcafe","plai","georg","wendt","look","like","rather","back","bar","stool","boston","jason","alexand","passabl","wig","go","see","well","danc","bugsi","malon","mention","good","version","stage","script","hope","young","never","see","music","judg","thi"],"filtered2":["humbl","opinion","version","great","bdwy","music","onli","two","thing","go","tyn","dali","fact","version","origin","script","okai","vanessa","william","good","watchbut","cast","seem","walk","show","chynna","phillip","idea","kim","realli","wonder","peopl","walk","harri","mcafe","plai","georg","wendt","look","like","rather","back","bar","stool","boston","jason","alexand","passabl","wig","go","see","well","danc","bugsi","malon","mention","good","version","stage","script","hope","young","never","see","music","judg"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,11,13,16,20,23,28,29,35,40,42,47,51,63,69,77,92,97,118,123,135,160,175,181,191,220,285,294,492,538,669,680,719,1010,1023,1070,1339,2070,2707,3038,3063,3874,4078,4741,5753,5896],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,11,13,16,20,23,28,29,35,40,42,47,51,63,69,77,92,97,118,123,135,160,175,181,191,220,285,294,492,538,669,680,719,1010,1023,1070,1339,2070,2707,3038,3063,3874,4078,4741,5753,5896],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,1.9416538289407692,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.463169012899134,1.6284968758320737,1.6219954307453837,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,1.8729627573220065,2.127032521151058,3.8927804517536475,2.0489535369135887,2.0545557924622586,4.70875905096179,2.2619070973220485,2.366244071437088,2.3722295531801256,2.3791142619576227,2.4442286541160034,2.5460113484259455,8.501080262633181,2.808171552082607,5.773557018660078,3.6016814428070463,3.43462735814388,3.7099788181381825,3.8095464139032247,3.857614816944247,4.34596758485818,4.1302590120314875,4.176068548062782,4.506310234933358,5.170884043049248,5.583416318380505,5.482320201509136,5.426230734858092,6.137727054086234,5.822646007446338,6.032366538428407,6.437831646536572,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.731064637626466E-5,7.678932261399582E-5,7.738628637492668E-5,7.693914758782864E-5,7.694040814913805E-5,7.683286083417696E-5,0.056169518686161976,7.680037977469576E-5,7.697305502548833E-5,0.2784199801622744,0.5038781041258076,7.667640702912602E-5,7.810753414271876E-5,7.9221755280304E-5,7.673231866525106E-5,7.652026364333849E-5,7.84289659009256E-5,7.706859259650006E-5,7.682948758819433E-5,7.689316557335465E-5,7.76371520490252E-5,7.714494806974733E-5,0.055212228007538465,7.731599896461506E-5,7.790935953581403E-5,7.7501915518605E-5,8.075994881500793E-5,7.669920222189257E-5,7.670125410517215E-5,7.68955762987008E-5,7.852997377148045E-5,7.706412712966807E-5,0.04534094213623809,7.728089714719329E-5,7.67826858542574E-5,7.713708856514245E-5,7.670574768424615E-5,7.675107513752614E-5,7.651987919934702E-5,7.653973198631728E-5,0.028986608413728868,7.752116281655304E-5,7.712724521143726E-5,7.682230564394637E-5,7.775577721062716E-5,7.685179046464605E-5,7.940519383068264E-5,7.823751731011619E-5,7.655875629398572E-5,7.672795582728471E-5,7.670134368146497E-5,7.886000781624902E-5,7.672909739299207E-5,7.653293700713373E-5,7.7372995517858E-5,7.674886077159604E-5,8.253496484187639E-5,7.668560973776774E-5,7.655787093588955E-5,7.692341229987373E-5,7.768642790040592E-5,7.69183233786

{"value":"Some here have commented that this is the WORST Elvis movie ever made. Well, they are only partly right. For me, this IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE PERIOD! I have never seen anything so basely crude, and insulting, and vile, and against human nature as this film. A true embarrassment to the Motion Picture Industry, this isn't even so Bad, its good. There is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of Elvis' other bad movies like Clambake. This one is so rotten to sit through its painful. Pure Garbage. Native Americans should sue for their poor clichéd and stereotypical treatment here.

{"value":"You ever sit through a movie and after it's all over it's like one big \"wtf!?\". <br /><br />Welcome to Decoy. <br /><br />Another straight to video action fodder flick you can immediately forget about having watched or better yet don't watch it at all. Peter Weller and Robert Patrick star and are quickly wasted in this going nowheres fast mercenaries-for-hire action dud where the story is pretty darn bad and the action sucks and what's the point of watching an action flick if the action blows? Robert Patrick in particular hits a new low in an action sequence that has him firing a machine gun while standing on the hood of a moving school bus.

{"value":"First off let me say that this has to be on the top of my list of boring movies. Nothing, and I mean nothing in this movie is even remotely thrilling. Most of it is very confusing and as it progresses you just wish it would end!! Some people want a movie that makes them \"think\" through the entire thing, to which I say...\"More power to you\"!! I on the other hand just want to be entertained. Which brings me back to this stinker, entertainment it is not. This movie is stupid and a complete waste of time. Seems that most here agree also. Most of this didn't make any sense, and by the time you think you have one scene figured out another lame scene comes around and....well I guess you see where this is going.

{"value":"The acting in the film is really well done honestly, but the movie is so slow and so boring, as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt. I am glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, so did the other actors as I mentioned but man... this is one of the worst dragged out films I have ever seen. Now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good, but other than that, avoid it. This film has so much filler it makes a Twinkie cake jealous. <br /><br />I never, ever, walk out on films, but watching this one at home with family, I walked out. Yeah, it was that boring. Apparently my comment doesn't have enough lines to post, so here's some more filler. I guess I was inspired by the movie I just watched.","finished_norm":["the","act","in","the","film","be","realli","good","do","honestli","but","the","movi","be","so","slow","and","so","bore","a","soon","a","it","get","interest","everyth","slow","to","a","major","halt","i","be","glad","to","see","sam","rockwel","in","thi","he","do","a","great","job","so","do","the","other","actor","a","i","mention","but","man","thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","drag","out","film","i","have","ever","see","now","mayb","in","a","short","film","form","thi","movi","would","be","good","but","other","than","that","avoid","it","thi","film","have","so","much","filler","it","make","a","twinki","cake","jealou","br","br","i","never","ever","walk","out","on","film","but","watch","thi","on","at","home","with","famili","i","walk","out","ye","it","be","that","bore","appar","my","comment","doe","not","have","enough","line","to","post","so","here","some","much","filler","i","guess","i","be","inspir","by","the","movi","i","just","watch"],"filtered":["act","film","realli","good","honestli","movi","slow","bore","soon","get","interest","everyth","slow","major","halt","glad","see","sam","rockwel","thi","great","job","actor","mention","man","thi","wrong","drag","film","ever","see","mayb","short","film","form","thi","movi","good","avoid","thi","film","much","filler","make","twinki","cake","jealou","br","br","never","ever","walk","film","watch","thi","home","famili","walk","ye","bore","appar","comment","doe","enough","line","post","much","filler","guess","inspir","movi","watch"],"filtered2":["act","realli","good","honestli","slow","bore","soon","get","interest","everyth","slow","major","halt","glad","see","sam","rockwel","great","job","actor","mention","man","wrong","drag","ever","see","mayb","short","form","good","avoid","filler","make","twinki","cake","jealou","never","ever","walk","watch","home","famili","walk","ye","bore","appar","comment","doe","enough","line","post","filler","guess","inspir","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,13,18,21,25,41,42,44,45,51,60,93,107,108,163,182,193,209,243,272,280,285,289,294,302,308,335,390,404,449,690,757,764,909,1058,1224,1227,2901,3223,3739,5102],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,13,18,21,25,41,42,44,45,51,60,93,107,108,163,182,193,209,243,272,280,285,289,294,302,308,335,390,404,449,690,757,764,909,1058,1224,1227,2901,3223,3739,5102],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,3.209458785004948,1.8162961064622165,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,2.035389827120098,2.1439533986393955,4.277015007255866,2.4000574358028657,2.7365296724240786,2.517840471459249,2.6026896854443837,2.627841366673578,2.8028805344481915,2.8028805344481915,2.808171552082607,2.8282659991423613,5.773557018660078,2.902686292364678,2.8753661172782943,2.908534262247101,6.265556250854638,3.1419947805322432,3.2597778161886266,3.607563812710113,3.7165362186843414,3.7465885637507435,3.9612932464190886,4.589376833631972,4.403125998698128,4.246178114249808,5.463272006538442,11.124725818365345,5.7446844659766265,6.137727054086234]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.827698700965145E-5,8.768171464877053E-5,8.836335637134066E-5,8.785279195686068E-5,8.78542313259457E-5,8.773142866718202E-5,8.799235422834894E-5,8.769434024275047E-5,8.789150908799483E-5,9.751083152469213E-5,0.7567666442242265,8.75527822431323E-5,8.918691150653182E-5,9.045918239675023E-5,8.761662481860214E-5,8.737449027061764E-5,8.955393763389875E-5,8.8000598447746E-5,8.7727576933873E-5,8.78002874974536E-5,8.864980677489545E-5,8.808778477247495E-5,8.818808607892158E-5,8.828309885057407E-5,8.896062627908426E-5,8.849538724797761E-5,9.22155652113567E-5,8.75788108825249E-5,8.758115382081485E-5,8.780304017874707E-5,8.966927324283218E-5,8.799549956452621E-5,0.23634150558613193,8.824301791960532E-5,8.767413647964796E-5,8.807881041488736E-5,8.75862848039347E-5,8.763804185412031E-5,8.737405129411398E-5,8.739672015409155E-5,8.75934395495726E-5,8.851736473168225E-5,8.806757080368383E-5,8.771937624704916E-5,8.878525864783398E-5,8.775304342299308E-5,9.066864129132516E-5,8.933533249274335E-5,8.741844301684892E-5,8.761164312192084E-5,8.758125610330256E-5,9.004612187168703E-5,8.761294661614634E-5,8.738896132245278E-5,8.834818023620541E-5,8.763551338538272E-5,9.424236325393389E-5,8.75632903352166E-5,8.74174320727058E-5,8.783482465383715E-5,8.870607229453752E-5,8.782901388057353E-5,8.740125965233982E-5,8.760476009929867E-5,8.737510809873101E-5,8.939678699850689E-5,8.812780363932606E-5,8.794007851452836E-5,8.78631709413736E-5,8.818344616609873E-5,8.737192051621512E-5,8.786501295159332E-5,8.92901251329534E-5,8.752849585093326E-5,8.9

{"value":"0.5/10. This movie has absolutely nothing good about it. The acting is among the worst I have ever seen, what is really amazing is that EVERYONE is awful, not just a few here and there, everyone. The direction is a joke, the low budget is hopelessly evident, the score is awful, I wouldn't say the movie was edited, brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase. It combines serial killings, voodoo and tarot cards. Dumb. Dumb. Dumb. It is not scary at all, the special effects are hopelessly lame. laughably bad throughout. The writing was appallingly bad. The cinematography is real cheap looking, and very grainy sometimes, and the camera-work is dreadful. Again, what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are.

{"value":"It is incredible that with all of the countless crimes that have been uncovered and laid unequivocally at the doorstep of Marxism, from the Berlin Wall to the Gulag archipelago to the Cultural Revolution to the Khmer Rouge, one still finds admirers of Communist totalitarianism in Hollywood and are still making propaganda in its favor. It just shows the moral depravity of Hollywood.<br /><br />In this particular film a psychotic murderer is glorified. Needless to say that neither his crimes nor his psychotic proclamations were included. That both the director and the actor expect audiences to sit through this seemingly interminable propagandistic film demonstrates the tunnel vision that they have in regards to their object of

{"value":"Must have to agree with the other reviewer. This has got to be the WORST movie, let alone western I have ever seen. Terrible acting, dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic (let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s), and oh, did I mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters? I was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene. And the ending? The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie...completely awful. And yes, it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable \"let's remember when\" shots when a main character dies. Luckily I saw this on free TV.

{"value":"I'm a big fan of 50s sci-fi, but this is not one of my favorites. While the concept behind the movie was a natural vehicle for a classic teeny bopper sci-fi flick, the director counted too heavily on it to carry the movie. It's clear he was working with no money, because the entire movie is loaded with bloated dialogue that goes on and on forever. I have *never* seen so much time-killing in a movie.<br /><br />There are probably less than 60 seconds of \"blob footage\" in the entire movie, and most of the rest of it is people engaging in a lot of poorly-written, run-on dialogue.

{"value":"Every generation fully believes it is living in the end times. This has been true for thousands of years now. And movies like this feed on this. How did they get the great Orson Welles to narrate this train wreck? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. It tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made, making it obviously dated and kind of silly.<br /><br />The reenactments look like they are out of \"Unsolved Mysteries\" but without the high production values. People should have been embarrassed to take part in this.<br /><br />In short, the movie is dated, silly, reactionary, and useless. Good if you want a good laugh, but not good enough to actually look

{"value":"Vodka Lemon is a charming, yet extremely uneven Arminian film that will delight some and bore others. Though reasonably well-crafted, the film lacks any real \"zing\", relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the astute art-house viewer. The film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance, unfortunately, they deserve a film worthy of their genius. Too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama, Vodka Lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled. You may laugh, but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides. A noble effort, ultimately done in by lack of narrative

{"value":"Miscasting happens. Susannah Yorke is a luminous young Jane Eyre, and her performance is impeccable. However, Edward Rochester is supposed to be 35. White-haired George C. Scott looks and behaves like an arthritic 80. Jane's deceased uncle is in better shape! He creaks and snarls, obnoxious and grim. He looks like an ax-murderer who has sent his ax out to be sharpened; we're not surprised he keeps a wife caged in the attic! The great love story looks like a sado-masochistic nightmare. There is enough darkness in the novel, but Bronte's Rochester is relatively young, athletic, powerful, and charming when he chooses to be.

The only thing this loser left out was the Russians normally end up being killed in the end. This film is utter doggy do do of the highest nature, please please please Van Damme get some acting lessons, you need them. Anyone who likes Van Damme has issues, It seems sad that the only way Van Damme ever gets any acting work is when he co writes the film, co produces the film and does the screen play for the film.

{"value":"A great concept gone wrong. Poor acting, even worse writing....After watching the first two episodes I was wondering why it ever made it to season two. The characters are forgettable, the writing is poor, the sets are just OK. The special effects are simply sad - so much better has been made in the same time-frame - where is the money going on this one? The first episode starts out interesting then goes downhill fast - the precept of the whole show is just silly. Now don't get me wrong, I am a huge Sci-Fi fan and 'geek' - but this show simply doesn't cut it. As I said in the beginning, I am truly surprised it made it to season two - so much better has been canceled after only one season (Jake 2.0 for example). This show was just bad.","finished_norm":["a","great","concept","go","wrong","poor","act","even","wrong","writingaft","watch","the","two","episod","i","be","wonder","why","it","ever","make","it","to","season","two","the","charact","be","forgett","the","write","be","poor","the","set","be","just","okai","the","special","effect","be","simpli","sad","so","much","well","have","be","make","in","the","same","timefram","where","be","the","monei","go","on","thi","on","the","episod","start","out","interest","then","go","downhil","fast","the","precept","of","the","whole","show","be","just","silli","now","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","be","a","huge","scifi","fan","and","geek","but","thi","show","simpli","doe","not","cut","it","a","i","sai","in","the","begin","i","be","truli","surpris","it","make","it","to","season","two","so","much","well","have","be","cancel","after","onli","on","season","jake","for","exampl","thi","show","be","just","bad"],"filtered":["great","concept","go","wrong","poor","act","even","wrong","writingaft","watch","two","episod","wonder","ever","make","season","two","charact","forgett","write","poor","set","okai","special","effect","simpli","sad","much","well","make","timefram","monei","go","thi","episod","start","interest","go","downhil","fast","precept","whole","show","silli","get","wrong","huge","scifi","fan","geek","thi","show","simpli","doe","cut","sai","begin","truli","surpris","make","season","two","much","well","cancel","onli","season","jake","exampl","thi","show","bad"],"filtered2":["great","concept","go","wrong","poor","act","even","wrong","writingaft","watch","two","wonder","ever","make","season","two","charact","forgett","write","poor","set","okai","special","effect","simpli","sad","well","make","timefram","monei","go","start","interest","go","downhil","fast","precept","whole","show","silli","get","wrong","huge","scifi","fan","geek","show","simpli","doe","cut","begin","truli","surpris","make","season","two","well","cancel","onli","season","jake","exampl","show","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,18,20,21,25,28,44,47,51,60,65,71,106,109,111,126,140,146,147,175,191,201,203,303,307,326,343,385,444,455,542,726,781,817,1391,2526,2592,3378,3715],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,18,20,21,25,28,44,47,51,60,65,71,106,109,111,126,140,146,147,175,191,201,203,303,307,326,343,385,444,455,542,726,781,817,1391,2526,2592,3378,3715],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,2.912480743411154,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,3.838916364248105,4.635688258055728,1.604729392502474,5.119408305932165,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,1.9214926742550966,2.159084361316692,2.125691139326857,2.1183455303375887,2.2391270689902285,2.317169775997098,4.652276891959716,2.2844323215331563,2.3791142619576227,2.5460113484259455,5.122871637503154,2.569760528637609,2.868298950055202,2.8767855639325206,2.942840385588056,2.9705344631698933,3.09496984188738,3.2535472664379905,3.2787058260741455,3.4471119148061256,3.7034641371169887,3.9363956947973615,12.591365871781843,4.429617614145104,5.143104478942172,5.1994574154933035,6.2980697041614135,5.7959777603641776]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.749282091728111E-5,8.690283637168411E-5,8.75784230583486E-5,8.707239399691328E-5,8.707382058005635E-5,8.695210877955956E-5,8.721071653418787E-5,8.69153498122815E-5,8.711076720306246E-5,9.664464102237989E-5,0.8971956619226229,8.677504927496651E-5,8.839466253819073E-5,8.965563182279011E-5,8.68383247356692E-5,8.659834107330905E-5,8.87584283657463E-5,8.721888752003303E-5,8.694829126126807E-5,8.702035593558071E-5,0.09596795398541974,8.730529936704262E-5,8.740470969514711E-5,8.749887846660887E-5,8.817038740656292E-5,8.770928110229029E-5,9.139641265668686E-5,8.680084670147867E-5,8.68031688274049E-5,8.702308416475584E-5,8.887273944635323E-5,8.721383393028626E-5,9.361666269019247E-5,8.745915357528399E-5,8.689532551957665E-5,8.729640472883785E-5,8.680825423190773E-5,8.685955152326861E-5,8.659790599624173E-5,8.662037348832094E-5,8.681534542180908E-5,8.773106335960468E-5,8.728526495930648E-5,8.694016342129546E-5,8.799657756919283E-5,8.697353153109888E-5,8.986323009016836E-5,8.854176509806345E-5,8.664190338649059E-5,8.683338729149076E-5,8.68032702013154E-5,8.924624052193611E-5,8.683467920675318E-5,8.661268357852572E-5,8.756338173309971E-5,8.685704551496514E-5,9.34052066151317E-5,8.678546402347638E-5,8.66409014225828E-5,8.705458629777156E-5,8.791809462972298E-5,8.704882714171327E-5,8.662487266212312E-5,8.68265654108846E-5,8.6598953413244E-5,8.860267370232678E-5,8.734496274556656E-5,8.715890518649056E-5,8.708268078471668E-5,8.740011099875483E-5,8.65957941460819

{"value":"I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once...but trust me, it is.<br /><br />I haven't seen the old movie..but why would they want to remake a movie like this. The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film doesn't fall under any of those and just remains dumb.I just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point , but it never does. <br /><br />So this movie is a big no no for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans. You could probably for it show up on television.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","big","fan","of","nicola","cage","and","i","never","think","he","would","work","on","a","movi","like","thi","i","can","not","believ","the","other","review","and","i","think","it","should","not","be","bad","to","watch","it","at","littl","oncebut","trust","me","it","isbr","br","i","have","not","see","the","old","moviebut","why","would","thei","want","to","remak","a","movi","like","thi","the","veri","basic","idea","of","a","good","horror","movi","be","either","it","should","have","a","extrem","intellig","script","or","it","should","be","extrem","graphic","thi","film","doe","not","fall","under","ani","of","that","and","just","remain","dumbi","just","keep","watch","the","movi","hope","it","would","get","interest","at","some","point","but","it","never","doe","br","br","so","thi","movi","be","a","big","no","no","for","both","horror","movi","fan","a","good","a","for","the","cage","fan","you","can","probabl","for","it","show","up","on","televis"],"filtered":["big","fan","nicola","cage","never","think","work","movi","like","thi","believ","review","think","bad","watch","littl","oncebut","trust","isbr","br","see","old","moviebut","thei","want","remak","movi","like","thi","veri","basic","idea","good","horror","movi","either","extrem","intellig","script","extrem","graphic","thi","film","doe","fall","ani","remain","dumbi","keep","watch","movi","hope","get","interest","point","never","doe","br","br","thi","movi","big","horror","movi","fan","good","cage","fan","probabl","show","televis"],"filtered2":["big","fan","nicola","cage","never","think","work","like","believ","review","think","bad","watch","littl","oncebut","trust","isbr","see","old","moviebut","want","remak","like","veri","basic","idea","good","horror","either","extrem","intellig","script","extrem","graphic","doe","fall","ani","remain","dumbi","keep","watch","hope","get","interest","point","never","doe","big","horror","fan","good","cage","fan","probabl","show","televis"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,9,12,14,15,18,27,28,37,42,48,60,66,67,77,82,83,91,123,134,140,148,170,176,181,207,286,329,483,603,663,682,1146,1290,1380,1932,4684],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,9,12,14,15,18,27,28,37,42,48,60,66,67,77,82,83,91,123,134,140,148,170,176,181,207,286,329,483,603,663,682,1146,1290,1380,1932,4684],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,2.133457220525776,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.430631986809635,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.4876543214774305,3.2439908614907673,1.6955116224012472,1.838176641236591,1.929723173391612,1.9570915389266579,1.9463902258768238,4.040393168790646,4.584637595480144,2.0105926690411424,2.2619070973220485,2.2443961816702407,6.951509327991294,2.3018654096236517,2.4071371113909277,2.5040471493269134,2.4442286541160034,2.5531798379045583,2.780700890737216,5.903973581628264,3.613480989738201,3.530930586689197,3.7297814454343623,3.6497387377608255,4.297765483040301,4.3336974922663645,10.0054942424945,4.8184434032493035,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0366975140086944E-4,1.0297068203116397E-4,1.0377118089635042E-4,1.031715899076199E-4,1.031732802579623E-4,1.0302906463012256E-4,1.0333548750404043E-4,1.0298550913654587E-4,1.0321705810375569E-4,1.1451369156892125E-4,0.8043672456641752,1.0281926781900277E-4,1.0473833846507038E-4,0.09552030824346547,1.0289424255649608E-4,1.0260988726475542E-4,1.051693625481374E-4,1.0334516925921059E-4,1.0302454127417065E-4,1.031099303014354E-4,1.041075793522918E-4,1.0344755817070818E-4,1.0356534890934508E-4,1.0367692895699717E-4,1.0447259612304172E-4,1.0392623385660489E-4,1.0829509529711076E-4,1.0284983504457921E-4,1.0285258651852838E-4,0.0921172910705815,1.0530480910460503E-4,1.0333918128914359E-4,1.1092585707399886E-4,1.0362985915669926E-4,1.0296178246474669E-4,1.034370189639273E-4,1.0285861218572088E-4,1.029193940577324E-4,1.0260937174438544E-4,1.0263599334938153E-4,1.0286701449675055E-4,1.0395204353078225E-4,1.034238195136653E-4,1.030149106423022E-4,1.0426664982433663E-4,1.0305444832792908E-4,1.0647843589743964E-4,1.0491263946088415E-4,1.0266150400462768E-4,1.0288839220665975E-4,1.0285270663590475E-4,1.0574736842830364E-4,1.0288992298978779E-4,1.0262688161851713E-4,1.0375335851466306E-4,1.0291642470258868E-4,1.1067530395999561E-4,1.0283160819593428E-4,1.0266031678322889E-4,1.0315048966506642E-4,1.0417365583078666E-4,1.0314366567344537E-4,1.0264132439511409E-4,1.0288030899869922E-4,1.0261061282290022E-4,1.0498480972349486E-4,1.0349455508483424E-4,1.032740965295672E-4,1.0318377866463003E-4,1.0355989993985526E-4,1.0260686942500925E-4,1.031859418642138E-4,1.0485954934182062E-4,1.027907466344111E-4,1.0533476405623647E-4,1.0306251492550

{"value":"This is possibly one of the worst giant killer animal movies I have ever seen. It follows the typical premise of a laboratory experiment gone wrong and a giant crocodile with a rapid growth chemical in it escapes. The monster looks way to much like a dinosaur, having big Tyranosaurous-like hind legs, when it should just look like an over-sized crocodile. Everything about this movie is unoriginal and it constantly oozes \"cliche\", minute after minute. Why are there always two drunken redneck hunters out after dark who separate?

{"value":"Phew--I don't what to say. This is a film that could be really good a with a bunch of stoned viewers. Some of the acting reminded me of John Waters' early offerings. Perhaps I should take that back--I don't want to insult Waters' ability as a director/storyteller.<br /><br />I particularly loved the lawyer taking about the \"full faith and credibility\" clause. It's \"full faith and credit,\" by the way!<br /><br />This also reminds me of \"The Conrad Boys,\" where the main actor is also the writer, director, film editor, etc. Those sort of multi-involved undertakings such as that are probably best left to very seasoned film professionals who would have the technical ability (albeit a stunt, some might say) to pull something off like that.","finished_norm":["phewi","do","not","what","to","sai","thi","be","a","film","that","can","be","realli","good","a","with","a","bunch","of","stone","viewer","some","of","the","act","remind","me","of","john","water","earli","offer","perhap","i","should","take","that","backi","do","not","want","to","insult","water","abil","a","a","directorstorytellerbr","br","i","particularli","love","the","lawyer","take","about","the","full","faith","and","credibl","claus","it","full","faith","and","credit","by","the","waybr","br","thi","conjur","remind","me","of","the","conrad","boi","where","the","main","actor","be","conjur","the","writer","director","film","editor","etc","that","sort","of","multiinvolv","undertak","such","a","that","be","probabl","well","leav","to","veri","season","film","profession","who","would","have","the","technic","abil","albeit","a","stunt","some","mai","sai","to","pull","someth","off","like","that"],"filtered":["phewi","sai","thi","film","realli","good","bunch","stone","viewer","act","remind","john","water","earli","offer","perhap","take","backi","want","insult","water","abil","directorstorytellerbr","br","particularli","love","lawyer","take","full","faith","credibl","claus","full","faith","credit","waybr","br","thi","conjur","remind","conrad","boi","main","actor","conjur","writer","director","film","editor","etc","sort","multiinvolv","undertak","probabl","well","leav","veri","season","film","profession","technic","abil","albeit","stunt","mai","sai","pull","someth","like"],"filtered2":["phewi","realli","good","bunch","stone","viewer","act","remind","john","water","earli","offer","perhap","take","backi","want","insult","water","abil","directorstorytellerbr","particularli","love","lawyer","take","full","faith","credibl","claus","full","faith","credit","waybr","conjur","remind","conrad","boi","main","actor","conjur","writer","director","editor","etc","sort","multiinvolv","undertak","probabl","well","leav","veri","season","profession","technic","abil","albeit","stunt","mai","pull","someth","like"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,13,15,20,21,31,37,39,41,46,53,54,58,74,148,179,266,269,279,282,287,291,318,336,356,419,429,497,507,544,644,709,817,830,847,944,1072,1100,1160,1208,1546,1971,2096,2373,3148,5857,6529,6657],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,13,15,20,21,31,37,39,41,46,53,54,58,74,148,179,266,269,279,282,287,291,318,336,356,419,429,497,507,544,644,709,817,830,847,944,1072,1100,1160,1208,1546,1971,2096,2373,3148,5857,6529,6657],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,2.814133962290301,1.4876543214774305,3.1077880109725475,1.5687599167621034,1.655771293751733,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,1.865701314626681,1.9486336368009016,2.3018654096236517,2.507968722980095,2.747702973022204,2.76533567167316,2.7910771187233068,2.918851229218033,2.841890188081905,3.016831637578237,2.902686292364678,5.846611159134827,3.028335462059722,3.1758963322079246,3.2872346624216657,3.342254038012865,3.365138331846453,3.4222967456864013,7.1341917263145325,3.6497387377608255,4.197121957260614,7.914200736318105,7.800348862726086,3.969732115064953,8.537555892334098,4.499089986959872,4.2574141875167335,4.297765483040301,4.6973654716960676,5.116075806554253,4.933754249760298,5.156897801074508,5.482320201509136,6.600350576034347,7.0356686472921925,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.969181830150485E-5,6.922187007808072E-5,6.976000411148274E-5,6.935693006454838E-5,6.93580663997603E-5,6.926111768332343E-5,6.946710995169429E-5,6.923183757506271E-5,6.938749598392962E-5,0.09330867150927052,0.6111617234187849,6.91200821252824E-5,7.041017418170431E-5,7.141459078805837E-5,6.917048376811438E-5,6.897932639523295E-5,7.069992940610458E-5,0.03789025665453557,6.925807686479291E-5,6.931547949663743E-5,6.998614741511351E-5,6.954244927133958E-5,6.962163389987158E-5,6.969664340169795E-5,7.02315293333718E-5,6.986423820664692E-5,7.280119805830941E-5,6.914063089193873E-5,6.914248056573397E-5,6.931765264924544E-5,7.079098312886703E-5,6.946959309259872E-5,0.09496124134735619,6.966500080657717E-5,6.921588735932878E-5,6.95353643070748E-5,6.914653131050234E-5,6.918739182307243E-5,6.897897983751993E-5,6.899687616729029E-5,6.915217975014534E-5,6.988158871727209E-5,6.952649099854546E-5,6.92516026885049E-5,7.009308227591023E-5,6.927818183204036E-5,0.15745525006676298,7.05273477368241E-5,6.901402566293529E-5,6.91665508801477E-5,6.914256131444086E-5,7.108849289963496E-5,6.916757994656463E-5,6.899075082134093E-5,6.974802304497615E-5,6.918539567900578E-5,7.440128938111013E-5,6.912837792319126E-5,6.901322755532059E-5,6.934274546151534E-5,7.003056721810368E-5,6.933815804447499E-5,6.90004599539352E-5,6.916111695

Whoever thought of this movie needs to be prevented from EVER making another one. This film disgusted me in a way that no other film ever. I REALLY think these people are insane. Just save your time and do not watch this fllm. Please - I wish that I had. The acting is horrible, the plot (what plot) is STUPID and degrading and insane. I really do not think this should have been made into a movie. But that is my opinion, and I am trying to save you from wasting your time.","finished_norm":["i","have","read","the","other","comment","about","thi","movi","and","usual","i","try","not","to","be","harsh","in","my","critic","becaus","i","try","to","be","a","nice","person","howev","thi","movi","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","that","i","have","ever","see","and","that","top","a","lot","of","bad","usa","network","plu","cinemax","night","whoever","think","of","thi","movi","ne","to","be","prevent","from","ever","make","anoth","on","thi","film","disgust","me","in","a","wai","that","no","other","film","ever","i","realli","think","thi","peopl","be","insan","just","save","your","time","and","do","not","watch","thi","fllm","pleas","i","wish","that","i","have","the","act","be","horribl","the","plot","what","plot","be","stupid","and","degrad","and","insan","i","realli","do","not","think","thi","should","have","be","make","into","a","movi","but","that","be","my","opinion","and","i","be","try","to","save","you","from","wast","your","time"],"filtered":["read","comment","thi","movi","usual","try","harsh","critic","becaus","try","nice","person","howev","thi","movi","wrong","movi","ever","see","top","lot","bad","usa","network","plu","cinemax","night","whoever","think","thi","movi","ne","prevent","ever","make","anoth","thi","film","disgust","wai","film","ever","realli","think","thi","peopl","insan","save","time","watch","thi","fllm","pleas","wish","act","horribl","plot","plot","stupid","degrad","insan","realli","think","thi","make","movi","opinion","try","save","wast","time"],"filtered2":["read","comment","usual","try","harsh","critic","becaus","try","nice","person","howev","wrong","ever","see","top","lot","bad","usa","network","plu","cinemax","night","whoever","think","ne","prevent","ever","make","anoth","disgust","wai","ever","realli","think","peopl","insan","save","time","watch","fllm","pleas","wish","act","horribl","plot","plot","stupid","degrad","insan","realli","think","make","opinion","try","save","wast","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,9,12,13,21,22,23,25,32,33,36,44,72,73,89,110,113,136,145,153,189,210,230,262,265,280,346,364,399,538,579,749,963,1285,1609,1651,1792,2296,2510,2976,7170],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,9,12,13,21,22,23,25,32,33,36,44,72,73,89,110,113,136,145,153,189,210,230,262,265,280,346,364,399,538,579,749,963,1285,1609,1651,1792,2296,2510,2976,7170],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,3.200185830788664,2.2635883139467947,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,2.742262257014735,1.4018535447685214,4.404055040881715,4.814188177507422,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,1.9940046109572438,2.1290479736304078,2.1521782565202803,2.346825985579986,2.34599021453259,2.3409902041158843,4.996386948150906,2.687151791517189,2.7121382192999195,2.726701583487816,2.73529586597515,2.8028805344481915,3.023389038124396,2.9878441007049847,3.129115117668582,3.43462735814388,3.5642670069567886,3.7165362186843414,4.035401218572811,8.899914596764454,4.621379564718146,4.646072177308517,4.8184434032493035,5.064116067623542,5.259176650194926,5.521540914662417,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.094600132443053E-5,9.033273117606044E-5,9.10349820242557E-5,9.05089809282914E-5,9.051046381604219E-5,0.4389932827289956,9.065276280120721E-5,9.034573849909805E-5,9.054886865417198E-5,1.0045902690382258E-4,0.5538995675523861,9.019990055812538E-5,9.188343697217603E-5,9.319417439068565E-5,9.026567338465605E-5,9.00162180093918E-5,9.226155996658638E-5,9.066125628080594E-5,9.03799800863706E-5,9.045488902057538E-5,9.133009312470853E-5,9.075107864417459E-5,9.085441251473297E-5,9.095229795406721E-5,9.165031011440396E-5,9.117100479404255E-5,9.500366063613195E-5,9.02267161615217E-5,9.022912993747893E-5,9.045772492792839E-5,9.23803826948889E-5,9.065600323518476E-5,9.731153984691513E-5,9.0911005194488E-5,9.032492388446153E-5,9.074183295099118E-5,9.023441605352596E-5,9.028773795444463E-5,9.001576576063441E-5,9.00391200032222E-5,9.024178711962486E-5,9.119364675691212E-5,9.073025351528512E-5,9.037153145553253E-5,9.146964032305498E-5,9.040621654313809E-5,9.340996617910886E-5,9.203634539900182E-5,9.006149964679665E-5,9.026054106865476E-5,9.022923531243087E-5,9.27686251696258E-5,9.02618839734318E-5,9.003112658685857E-5,9.101934704561785E-5,9.028513303861156E-5,9.709173799024946E-5,9.021072635756632E-5,9.006045813721987E-5,9.049047039208113E-5,9.138805980659502E-5,9.048448393274638E-5,9.004379675112313E-5,9.025344994099264E-5,9.001685451725554E-5,9.209965795363117E-5,9.079230746315598E-5,9.059890655509583E-5,9.05196737166526E-5,9.08496323162687E-5,9.001357055964061E-5,9.052157141920856E-5,9.198977121537138E-5,9.017487987796944E-5,9.240666117085642E-5,9.0413

{"value":"This movie is like real life, by which I mean - not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so, and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast (their invisibility being due to the \"experimental\" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers). <br /><br />A big bore. No big surprise that Altman helms this - he is a very variable performer (yes we all loved \"Gosford Park\", but \"Pret A Porter\" anyone? Kansas City? Dr T. and the Women? Aaargh), but the fact that the raw material is a John Grisham tale, and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber - makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film. And no, it is not \"so bad it's good\".<br /><br />It's just bad.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","like","real","life","by","which","i","mean","not","a","lot","happen","in","the","avail","hour","or","so","and","not","much","game","plan","or","plot","be","evid","by","the","frequent","invis","cast","their","invis","be","due","to","the","experiment","light","a","mention","by","mani","review","br","br","a","big","bear","no","big","surpris","that","altman","helm","thi","he","be","a","veri","variabl","perform","ye","we","all","love","gosford","park","but","pret","a","porter","anyon","kansa","citi","dr","t","and","the","woman","aaargh","but","the","fact","that","the","raw","materi","be","a","john","grisham","tale","and","the","excel","cast","that","you","will","perceiv","through","the","gather","gloam","of","your","insist","slumber","make","thi","truli","a","masterpiec","of","bad","film","and","no","it","be","not","so","bad","it","goodbr","br","it","just","bad"],"filtered":["thi","movi","like","real","life","mean","lot","happen","avail","hour","much","game","plan","plot","evid","frequent","invis","cast","invis","due","experiment","light","mention","mani","review","br","br","big","bear","big","surpris","altman","helm","thi","veri","variabl","perform","ye","love","gosford","park","pret","porter","anyon","kansa","citi","dr","woman","aaargh","fact","raw","materi","john","grisham","tale","excel","cast","perceiv","gather","gloam","insist","slumber","make","thi","truli","masterpiec","bad","film","bad","goodbr","br","bad"],"filtered2":["like","real","life","mean","lot","happen","avail","hour","game","plan","plot","evid","frequent","invis","cast","invis","due","experiment","light","mention","mani","review","big","bear","big","surpris","altman","helm","veri","variabl","perform","ye","love","gosford","park","pret","porter","anyon","kansa","citi","dr","woman","aaargh","fact","raw","materi","john","grisham","tale","excel","cast","perceiv","gather","gloam","insist","slumber","make","truli","masterpiec","bad","bad","goodbr","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,9,15,32,50,54,70,72,75,80,82,88,92,94,97,105,158,174,176,209,285,291,326,343,353,374,525,537,568,580,581,595,739,820,935,1015,1174,1586,1762,1784,1914,2204,2492,3186,3583,3775,4436,4639,4974,6306],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,9,15,32,50,54,70,72,75,80,82,88,92,94,97,105,158,174,176,209,285,291,326,343,353,374,525,537,568,580,581,595,739,820,935,1015,1174,1586,1762,1784,1914,2204,2492,3186,3583,3775,4436,4639,4974,6306],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,3.205071257016622,1.2000607798565692,1.3711311285073675,1.717994385570355,1.8113893252729412,2.094675786251684,1.9209463754160525,1.9742250248702675,1.9951803900462557,4.040393168790646,2.0317223413467334,4.0979070738271774,2.08112281984698,2.0545557924622586,2.1765612129984904,2.3106972614914807,2.456282578459816,2.5040471493269134,2.6026896854443837,2.808171552082607,3.016831637578237,2.942840385588056,2.9705344631698933,3.0266839340212486,3.4572130107926293,3.4149707055943286,3.424750734647968,3.4471119148061256,3.5039747767006686,3.530930586689197,3.6284289511740746,4.004218291136122,3.900174431363043,4.135246553542527,4.086456389373095,4.235066888824737,4.589376833631972,4.74221603786142,10.612859070090943,4.838444069955973,5.00274712124725,5.143104478942172,5.604922523601468,6.137727054086234,5.770002273960917,5.9370563586240825,6.032366538428407,6.543192162194399,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.754142538878668E-5,6.708597776749381E-5,6.760750727485932E-5,6.72168703775783E-5,6.721797165032167E-5,6.712401435867187E-5,6.732365058231933E-5,6.709563770993943E-5,6.724649316277234E-5,7.460631332267242E-5,0.43759231823956357,6.698733055772147E-5,6.823761586376013E-5,0.04626718811687791,6.703617702035905E-5,6.685091795046176E-5,0.21575412011865622,6.732995830019868E-5,6.712106736685984E-5,6.71766987977844E-5,6.782667275857897E-5,6.739666525119554E-5,6.747340657909137E-5,0.06319964842276302,6.806448323515598E-5,6.770852514945461E-5,0.06468077960627104,6.700724527689189E-5,6.70090378776258E-5,6.71788048961516E-5,6.860667466749086E-5,6.732605710406339E-5,0.16750876649655488,6.751543536762039E-5,6.708017964998082E-5,6.738979889877519E-5,6.70129636336501E-5,6.705256336469975E-5,6.685058208604485E-5,6.686792621124314E-5,6.701843778648481E-5,6.772534029716358E-5,6.738119938278333E-5,6.711479295609875E-5,6.793030806467351E-5,6.714055198038238E-5,6.937129911571593E-5,6.835117394164559E-5,6.688454654643874E-5,6.703236548457711E-5,6.700911613477126E-5,6.889500455289899E-5,6.7033362798384E-5,6.686198986740104E-5,6.759589589307513E-5,6.705062881314365E-5,7.210558223382253E-5,6.69953703826128E-5,6.688377306502838E-5,6.720312345102687E-5,6.786972195549426E-5,6.719867758215289E-5,6.687139941748436E-5,6.7
