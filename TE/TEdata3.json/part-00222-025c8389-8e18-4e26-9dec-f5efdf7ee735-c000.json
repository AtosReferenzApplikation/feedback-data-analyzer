{"value":"This was one of the most boring \"horror\" movies that I have ever seen. A college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at Alcatraz. Trying to deliver a mix of \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80s music video, this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story. Although, being such a bad, and often laughable movie (dig those mullets and the terrible dialog), it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Don't be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the 1987 winner of the Silver Scroll Award by the Academy of Sicence Fiction, Fanatasy, and Horror, or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack, or that Tony Basil has a part in the film. It is a giant disaster, though one with a small cult following (see the other IMDb comments for this film).","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","much","bore","horror","movi","that","i","have","ever","see","a","colleg","kid","have","a","epidem","of","nightmar","involv","roam","spirit","at","alcatraz","try","to","deliv","a","mix","of","nightmar","on","elm","street","and","standard","vampir","fare","in","the","form","of","a","bad","music","video","thi","movi","be","jam","full","of","bad","act","and","a","exhaust","slow","move","stori","although","be","such","a","bad","and","often","laughabl","movi","dig","that","mullet","and","the","terribl","dialog","it","would","be","good","materi","to","spoof","on","for","a","episod","of","mysteri","scienc","theater","do","not","be","fool","by","the","proud","mention","of","the","film","be","the","winner","of","the","silver","scroll","award","by","the","academi","of","sicenc","fiction","fanatasi","and","horror","or","that","devo","contribut","to","the","soundtrack","or","that","toni","basil","have","a","part","in","the","film","it","be","a","giant","disast","though","on","with","a","small","cult","follow","see","the","other","imdb","comment","for","thi","film"],"filtered":["thi","much","bore","horror","movi","ever","see","colleg","kid","epidem","nightmar","involv","roam","spirit","alcatraz","try","deliv","mix","nightmar","elm","street","standard","vampir","fare","form","bad","music","video","thi","movi","jam","full","bad","act","exhaust","slow","move","stori","although","bad","often","laughabl","movi","dig","mullet","terribl","dialog","good","materi","spoof","episod","mysteri","scienc","theater","fool","proud","mention","film","winner","silver","scroll","award","academi","sicenc","fiction","fanatasi","horror","devo","contribut","soundtrack","toni","basil","part","film","giant","disast","though","small","cult","follow","see","imdb","comment","thi","film"],"filtered2":["bore","horror","ever","see","colleg","kid","epidem","nightmar","involv","roam","spirit","alcatraz","try","deliv","mix","nightmar","elm","street","standard","vampir","fare","form","bad","music","video","jam","full","bad","act","exhaust","slow","move","stori","although","bad","often","laughabl","dig","mullet","terribl","dialog","good","materi","spoof","mysteri","scienc","theater","fool","proud","mention","winner","silver","scroll","award","academi","sicenc","fiction","fanatasi","horror","devo","contribut","soundtrack","toni","basil","part","giant","disast","though","small","cult","follow","see","imdb","comment"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,9,17,21,36,44,61,83,86,108,114,118,166,237,240,241,260,275,280,285,336,363,390,400,403,424,432,485,517,537,552,591,616,664,689,782,796,814,894,907,910,916,933,1004,1034,1054,1057,1456,1547,1776,1799,1880,1894,2105,2339,2667,3206,4046,4574,4762,5860,6268,8570],"values":[2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,9,17,21,36,44,61,83,86,108,114,118,166,237,240,241,260,275,280,285,336,363,390,400,403,424,432,485,517,537,552,591,616,664,689,782,796,814,894,907,910,916,933,1004,1034,1054,1057,1456,1547,1776,1799,1880,1894,2105,2339,2667,3206,4046,4574,4762,5860,6268,8570],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,3.205071257016622,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.4680183469605717,1.604729392502474,1.8818517047392527,4.584637595480144,2.031112399272319,2.138507503627933,2.4433074195966826,2.354379525480895,2.4423870329693536,2.640097787510554,2.7666071276613566,2.6627744961815836,2.6754694156628323,2.7832848715031413,2.8028805344481915,2.808171552082607,2.9233055795674137,3.0349689855553557,3.132778125427319,3.130944944345658,3.189397019426827,3.212973749990824,3.235085203598255,4.160564361526816,3.4198487640477615,3.424750734647968,3.424750734647968,3.509308122676031,3.5173618574831282,3.6905607322810807,3.607563812710113,3.7568101178222815,3.850067611308864,3.9363956947973615,4.091229668125752,4.181290492043933,4.096025840389245,4.100845126825194,4.091229668125752,4.176068548062782,4.125296222689358,8.619199881374609,4.181290492043933,4.8085911068062925,4.724033718778229,4.760735085628657,4.770124825978496,4.933754249760298,4.848596441419991,5.156897801074508,5.170884043049248,5.243909178064138,5.907203395474402,5.7959777603641776,6.101359409915359,6.101359409915359,6.437831646536572,6.725513718988353,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.755512788370734E-4,1.7539571397384498E-4,1.7543902053052514E-4,1.7540375167560856E-4,1.7542035156011338E-4,1.753947468947919E-4,1.7544929709613623E-4,1.7536865101711833E-4,1.753957510419361E-4,1.7557700354468823E-4,1.769701559643214E-4,1.753960407503607E-4,1.7556215188484686E-4,1.7558044243214403E-4,1.7550068082166666E-4,1.7540444256559936E-4,1.754647884775715E-4,1.7554736280356173E-4,1.7541349794067935E-4,1.754128566115

{"value":"I have been watching horror movies since I was 5 years old, beginning with Childs Play.Since then, I have seen good horror movies and bad, but this is without question, the DUMBEST movie I have ever seen! The actors did all they could with the material. The plot was just idiotic. Plus , it was just all gore. I can stomach a lot of blood, but that was just ridiculous! In one of the scenes, a character gets stabbed in the rear end and choked with his intestines! Plain Stupid! Another problem with this movie is that its boring and probably the slowest movie ever made. The end of it is just dumb. But then again, it goes with the rest of it! At the end, when the girl gets away from the cannibal/ancestor, she receives help from a old lady. The old lady is making tea, but when she turns around to talk to the girl, the girl attacks her! She turned into a cannibal!

{"value":"argh! this film hurts my head. and not in a good way.<br /><br />maybe it's just my growing hatred for the action genre, but even as a kid when i would swallow tripe like Navy Seals, i still regarded this film with dislike. now i utterly despise it.<br /><br />take one fairly good fast-paced story. keep the title and throw the rest away. instead use some half-assesd future gladiators storyline thats so full of plot holes the whole things in danger of collapsing (why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena, what about the cameras? why have clearly marked footage of what really happened at bakersfeild in an unguarded room?)<br /><br />the whole film screams eighties, from the truley awful score to the goofy shiny costumes. ugh.<br /><br />don't watch this film. i know

{"value":"This has got to be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. I remember watching it years ago when it initially came out on video and for some strange reason I thought I enjoyed it. So, like an idiot, I ran out to purchase the DVD once it was released...what a tragic mistake! I won't even bother to go into the plot because it is so transparent that you can see right through it anyhow. I am a fan of Herschell Gordon Lewis so I am accustomed to cheesy gore effects and bad acting but these people take this to a whole different level. It is almost as if they are intentionally trying to make the worst movie humanly possible...if that was their goal, they suceeded. If they intended to make a film that was supposed to scare you or make you believe in any way, shape, or form that it is real then they failed...MISERABLY!

{"value":"Less self-conscious and much less pretentious than GUTS OF A BEAUTY, this Kazuo Komizu gore flick is worth a look (at least once).<br /><br />Sleazy snapshotters escort wanna-be actresses/models to a remote house in the woods in order to sexually molest them. Unfortunately (for the horny boys), a long-schlonged demon, who lives in the woods, has already targeted the girls for fun.<br /><br />The thing even ends up having fun with the boys -- that's IF you consider beheadings, dismemberment and masturbation with severed limbs \"fun\".<br /><br />Once again, it all sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on film.<br /><br />Just as Komizu mangled LIVING DEAD AT TOKYO BAY with his ineptitude, he also mangles this effort and is only saved by some audacious violence and some great white panty shots.<br /><br />Don't buy the hype, though, or

{"value":"\"Everything a great documentary could be\"?? Yeah, if one is deaf, dumb, and blind. Everything but meaning, wit, visual style, and interesting subject matter. Aside from that. . .<br /><br />Seriously, volken. This is a movie that is completely inauthentic. An adventure doc with no adventure, a war doc with no feeling for war, a campy send-up with no trace of wit. It means nothing, feels like nothing, and carries the implicit message that absolutely nothing matters. No wonder it has so many IMDb fans! Of course, going in you know a movie starring the great Skip Lipman will have no culture, no intelligence, no wit (other than a corrosive adolescent jokiness), and no recognizable human emotion  just adrenaline. \"Darkon\" isn't a movie -- it's a panic attack! Avoid.

{"value":"Good movies are original, some leave a message or touch you in a certain way, but sometimes you're not in the mood for that. <br /><br />I wanted something simple, no thinking just plain action when I watched this one. It started of good and was quite entertaining, so why a bad review. Well in the end the movie lost it's credibility. The storyline wasn't that cheesy at all, the action was not too special but overall good, acting was OK, so more than enough to satisfy my needs. But all got ruined because things happened that were over the top, and it left me with a bad feeling. They should have put a little more effort in making everything credible and would have gotten a 7 in the \"no thinking just plain action\" category. So in conclusion if you know you'll get irritated because things are happening that seem completely illogical: don't watch! otherwise I'd say go

{"value":"I felt this movie started out well. The acting was spot on and I felt for all the characters situation, even though the true family unit was not completely revealed. We never got enough info on the father to truly feel his pain for his whole involvement or the build up for his animosity with Tobe. I mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off. Another problem with the movie was it just unraveled and lost all focus by the end, and I was begging for it to just be over with. Any movie with such a long drawn out , and painful ending should never get an automatic rating of 7 or above just for the acting. We are looking at the over all quality of the movie experience. In the case of this movie the end is so bad I seriously contemplated just walking out of the theater.

{"value":"Once again the same familiar story about a man (writer here) who sell his soul to the devil in order to have his most desired ambition in life: success. Unfunny script (we should \"go home and write better\"), ridiculous lines in order to understand the \"strong\" \"Christmanish\" message (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a very long trial scene at the end where the agent Hopkins beat the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is no sexy or evil at all) for all the bad things she made to this unlikable character. Not bad efforts from the actors (Baldwin also as a director, Cattrall in a \"Sex and the City\" role again, Aykroyd with some funny lines in his limited role). P.S.

{"value":"I went for this movie believing it had good ratings. Firstly, it is ridiculous that they're releasing a movie originally made in 2001, seven years later in 2008 here in India. Everything in the movie looks dated. Even for 2001 the movie looks like its been made on a shoe string budget. There is a scene where a taxi hits a man to elaborate how low budget you can get. Anthony Hopkins doesn't seem to know what he is doing in the film. He ends up giving a long monologue towards the end. If the film had bright sparks during that scene, I missed it as I was sleeping on my seat. Nothing about Jennifer Love Hewitt resembles a Devil. She wears ill-fitting trite clothes and scowls at random kids. As for Alec Baldwin a scene where he goes to meet Webster for the first time is not to be missed. What a waste of money!

{"value":"BTK Killer, Green River Killer, Zodiac Killer; the man keeps putting out absolute garbage and the ironic thing is, he loves his crap.<br /><br />I've never seen a Ulli Lommel film but I was so amazed on how everyone thinks his stuff is so awful. Like the movies I said in the beginning don't even equal a six when added together! After reading the comments I was curious to see how bad this guy really is. He is the worst out there.<br /><br />The credits wouldn't end as the pathetic movie started and quickly I noticed that the audio was incredibly badly dubbed in. The acting was incredibly awful and same to the camera shots. The editing is easily the worst. This movie made no sense and I unbearably couldn't take it anymore as it wouldn't end and I was only 45 minutes in the movie. I couldn't take it anymore.

{"value":"While the idea is more original than most Sci-Fi movies, the execution is, as usual lacking. While the practical mummy effects are not bad, and the \"Gun Nut\" character is over the top giggle inducing, the only real draw is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin reunited on the small screen. I suspect that was the idea all along. They do the best they can with what they have but the \"must see\" moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when Morena's character sported some Tomb Raider style shorts. Not high brow cinema I know but you can't deny true beauty when you see it!!! And Adam Baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate. If you just want to watch a couple of your favorite Firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you.

{"value":"Reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high: a big budget, tons of popular faces, a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves. The end result is a disaster. Alice Tremblay's supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it's audience (I didn't hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation), going through it's page-thin story line and one-dimensional characters without a single spark, not a sign of the magic it wished it had. The 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn't seem that great an idea on the set, let alone on paper. 'L'Odyssée d'Alice Tremblay' is a collage of comic sketches, linked together with a (very) thin layer of good ideas.

{"value":"Like 'First Blood', this attempts to make a point about the treatment of Vietnam vets, but there really isn't much time for that in between the monotonous gunfire, burnings, stabbings, torture and explosions as an impossibly indestructible Rambo takes out half of Asia, a ton of Vietnamese soldiers, most of the Russian army, various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket launcher at. The only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off, allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises. Helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is Jerry Goldsmith, who carefully checks off all the clichéd themes from Russian rat-a-tat to Chinese ching-chang-chong just in case we don't quite understand who we're looking at.

{"value":"Bottom of the barrel, unimaginative, and practically unwatchable remake of THE ROAD WARRIOR. This film follows the exact plot as the Filipino film STRYKER and is worse by far! Bad acting, dialog, effects, dubbing, pacing, action sequences... The list goes on and on. Italy made literally dozens of Road Warrior rip-offs in the early 80's, some good, some bad. This is the worst by far, no contest. Not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable, the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half. There was 1 (one) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie, and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding. But EVERYTHING else about this movie seriously reeks! For actual post-nuke fun, go track down a copy of ENDGAME, AFTER THE FALL OF NEW YORK, or ESCAPE FROM THE BRONX instead.

{"value":"What's with Indonesian musical movies? Never have I seen Indonesian musical movies like the ones made in Bollywood. They miss the spirit of the story and just a bunch of 'what they called' poetic lines.<br /><br />This story about love of two kids who are separated and then meet again after a few years of changes has no special remarks. It's a simple story plot (but it's quite focused though) with 'meant to be' musical story lines here and there.<br /><br />Confusing characters that should be saved by brilliant acting are neglected. The main actress may try to live up the character, but it's the best that she could do, trying. As for the casting, I don't feel the necessity to put a Balinese student in that story and of course, that's not the only unnecessary characters.<br /><br />The strange thing is, why would I want to watch this movie?

{"value":"I watched this movie after having so much of trouble in downloading it through rapidshare. And I have to say, it did not deserve it.<br /><br />Parinda was so hyped, that I was really looking forward to watch it.<br /><br />Parinda is one of those movies which fail to satisfy the standards set by other good Indian film-makers, despite having a great story. It was even more pathetic to know, that the story itself was not original, it was loosely based on the classic \"On the Waterfront\".<br /><br />Anil Kapoor was irritating, especially when he comes from America. The direction lacked quality many a times, except a few in-between scenes.<br /><br />Give this script to any of them - Ram Gopal Verma, Deepa Mehta, Mahesh Bhatt, Sudhir Mishra, and I'm 100% sure, they'll make a mind-blowing movie out of it.<br /><br />I'm not saying Parinda was bad.

{"value":"\"Dahmer\" is an interesting film although I wouldn't use \"horror\" or \"thriller\" do describe it. It's more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner portrays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged, murdered and dismembered his male victims. The film centers on the relationship between Dahmer and \"Rodney\", well-played by Artel Kayàru. <br /><br />Rodney is almost the more interesting character: enamored of Dahmer and having once escaped an attack, he returns to Dahmer for sex and survives a second attack.<br /><br />I think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray Dahmer's formative years, how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into Dahmer's belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims.<br /><br />The roles are well played but the story is thin.","finished_norm":["dahmer","be","a","interest","film","although","i","would","not","us","horror","or","thriller","do","describ","it","it","much","a","minor","charact","studi","that","seem","oddli","sympathet","of","the","killerbr","br","jeremi","renner","portrai","serial","killer","jeffrei","dahmer","who","drug","murder","and","dismemb","hi","male","victim","the","film","center","on","the","relationship","between","dahmer","and","rodnei","wellplai","by","artel","kayàru","br","br","rodnei","be","almost","the","much","interest","charact","enamor","of","dahmer","and","have","onc","escap","a","attack","he","return","to","dahmer","for","sex","and","surviv","a","attackbr","br","i","think","the","film","be","disjoint","becaus","it","doe","littl","to","portrai","dahmer","form","year","how","event","mai","have","creat","the","human","monster","we","see","on","screen","and","offer","no","insight","into","dahmer","belief","that","he","can","creat","sexual","zombi","of","hi","victimsbr","br","the","role","be","good","plai","but","the","stori","be","thin"],"filtered":["dahmer","interest","film","although","us","horror","thriller","describ","much","minor","charact","studi","seem","oddli","sympathet","killerbr","br","jeremi","renner","portrai","serial","killer","jeffrei","dahmer","drug","murder","dismemb","hi","male","victim","film","center","relationship","dahmer","rodnei","wellplai","artel","kayàru","br","br","rodnei","almost","much","interest","charact","enamor","dahmer","onc","escap","attack","return","dahmer","sex","surviv","attackbr","br","think","film","disjoint","becaus","doe","littl","portrai","dahmer","form","year","event","mai","creat","human","monster","see","screen","offer","insight","dahmer","belief","creat","sexual","zombi","hi","victimsbr","br","role","good","plai","stori","thin"],"filtered2":["dahmer","interest","although","us","horror","thriller","describ","minor","charact","studi","seem","oddli","sympathet","killerbr","jeremi","renner","portrai","serial","killer","jeffrei","dahmer","drug","murder","dismemb","male","victim","center","relationship","dahmer","rodnei","wellplai","artel","kayàru","rodnei","almost","interest","charact","enamor","dahmer","onc","escap","attack","return","dahmer","sex","surviv","attackbr","think","disjoint","becaus","doe","littl","portrai","dahmer","form","year","event","mai","creat","human","monster","see","screen","offer","insight","dahmer","belief","creat","sexual","zombi","victimsbr","role","good","plai","stori","thin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,10,12,14,17,18,22,35,40,46,56,57,60,83,128,131,192,236,237,252,254,268,273,292,362,413,469,470,488,495,507,519,535,577,638,649,668,689,697,714,886,980,1097,1134,1171,1314,1513,1578,2170,2247,2278,3160,3177,3273,4154,6722,8187,8325],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,10,12,14,17,18,22,35,40,46,56,57,60,83,128,131,192,236,237,252,254,268,273,292,362,413,469,470,488,495,507,519,535,577,638,649,668,689,697,714,886,980,1097,1134,1171,1314,1513,1578,2170,2247,2278,3160,3177,3273,4154,6722,8187,8325],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,2.247774048205673,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.463169012899134,1.6284968758320737,1.655771293751733,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,3.676353282473182,2.292318797740072,2.3409902041158843,2.2512118082053005,2.5318267134339894,2.617923930016232,2.640097787510554,3.0433232530252132,2.889652074525771,3.6746621462132825,2.9674191958529437,2.9752256367457734,6.117078200524934,3.467417180966871,6.657541375351156,3.3814747511661465,3.3933092088131493,3.5173618574831282,3.365138331846453,3.5614461306151473,3.4986697244709752,3.604618302480356,3.613480989738201,3.6375061693251913,3.5813614403160887,3.607563812710113,3.7952092507568174,3.7297814454343623,3.9782428047328615,4.081705786614497,4.186539847930077,4.403125998698128,4.297765483040301,4.4637506205145625,4.535724120139652,4.613282354485526,5.00274712124725,5.064116067623542,5.02684467282631,47.07859603291847,5.695894301807195,5.822646007446338,12.685042933464494,6.543192162194399,6.948657270302562,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.730782511800194E-4,1.729248777916226E-4,1.7296757427976258E-4,1.7293280226459687E-4,1.7294916830304965E-4,1.7292392433601483E-4,1.7297770607724015E-4,1.7289819607643918E-4,1.7292491433752773E-4,1.7310361349828665E-4,1.7447714028780725E-4,1.7292519996476907E-4,1.7308897105689007E-4,1.7310700394141412E-4,1.7302836594946E-4,1.729334834218756E-4,1.7299297922833843E-4,1.7307439031249253E-4,1.7294241123198898E-4,1.7294177893737475E-4,1.7309736635736704E-4,1.7295910593802117E-4,1.729593676966389E-4,1.7307016731943226E-4,1.7294247361667145E-4,1.73

{"value":"Pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain! The majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties. This is a horrible film in every way. Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. They would receive a D for this. College kids would receive an F or asked to leave the school. Since this monstrosity was made by \"Professionals\" I believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation. I enjoy watching bad movies Like \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" but, this thing doesn't even fall into that category. The script, acting, sound, and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. If you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with Ed Wood, blaxploitation, or 1970's horror films.

{"value":"This movie is one of the worst comedy movies i have ever seen. I hate these Napoleon Dynamite rip-offs. Just face it people the dumb humor has been mastered already. Make something new for once. All these new comedies are just horrible. And coming out of SNL Andy Samberg is not ready for a lead role yet. I hope he can bounce back from this awful movie. And Will Arnetts character is just plain bad. Hey Will, did you read the script. The plot is truly the worst ever written. Now you tell me if this is weird. (this is the movie) Rod Kimble's step dad Frank is dying and the family needs $50,000 to pay for the heart surgery so Rod is planning this huge jump to raise money for Frank. Only so that Rod can beat Frank in a fight and prove his manliness.

{"value":"Original Claymation Rudolph: Pretty good. Original Frosty cartoon: Needs a little work, but could be worse. But Frosty and Rudolph together on the Fourth of July? C'mon! Give me a BREAK!!! This was one movie that shouldn't have been made. It was bad. It didn't really go for any holiday in particular, except July 4. That made it especially bad since Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season. And any movie can be ruined by too much singing. The frequent songs made this movie seem a lot longer than it really was. The movie tried mixing two familiar Chirstmastime characters with an American traditional holiday (which almost seems to \"limit\" it to America), too many pointless songs, and a lousy plotline. The result? A bad movie that can't really be watched at any time of year.

{"value":"Anybody who has ever been a fan of the original series, or even has a clue about the storyline should be embarrassed by this series. The Borg does not come around until Q brings the Enterprise to the Gamma sector, the Klingons are NEVER seen until Kirk encounters them, the NCC-1701 was the FIRST ship to carry the Enterprise name....need I go on? Berman and Pilliar have made a mockery of Gene Roddenberry's creation. After he died, they only saw $$$$ and just went their own way. No wonder Majel Barrett was in every single episode of star trek until this series. I don't blame her for not being involved with this mess. Poor Bakula. He's a great actor, as are the entire cast. I like them all, but the storyline is tragic and ignores all of the precedents set by the original series. Just check the ratings.

{"value":"This film is self indulgent rubbish. Watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken Gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack. Watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed. It should be charming but isn't - it's just irritating. The characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor. The stories within the film are also charmless and sinister. I was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter. It is rarely that I cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us.<br /><br />Although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap East European film made during the Cold War. There isn't even enough in the way of beautiful Scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it.

{"value":"I am not an artistically inclined individual. I am a science minded woman and I felt that this movie was maybe one of those campy artsy type films on a budget. I watched part of it with my fiancé and my future step daughter. We tried very hard to find something in this film to keep our interest. My fiancé and his daughter voted it off and we moved on to Ocean's 13,but that is another story. Not to be deterred I awoke the next morning and gave the movie another shot. I began again watching this movie in earnest. I just don't get it,I thought I would get it.I thought the funniest part was the flushing of the ashes and the urn finding a spot by the fireplace being used as a vase for what appeared to be dead flowers. Interesting and still it had dead stuff inside. It was an odd and bizarre movie.

{"value":"I ve finished seeing the movie 10 minutes ago..WoW i still cant believe what i've watched.<br /><br />This is absolutely the worst movie EVER. If i would list all the flaws in the movie , this review would take me a lot of sentences.( very funny flaws, because of being that bad though)<br /><br />You got to be Amazed with the skill of the commandos assigned to rescue the plane. they didn't even know how to move.<br /><br />Ice-t is so bad actor... and the thing i don't understand, is how the production wanted him to be like a hero, but he's a zero..<br /><br />of course the major flaws will be the landing of an 747, needing only 3 or 4 tips from a guy in transmission to land the plane...amazing.. as well as the dead bodys that had

{"value":"This God forsaken film is about three dumb millionaires who gather a bunch of people to play a deadly game, and the winner gets a million dollars. First of all, the acting is terrible, and the movie makes absolutely no sense at all. It is not scary in the least bit, it is so stupid that it made me laugh, which is why it earned that 1 star.The movie is not violent at all, but is pretty sleazy and focuses mostly on the women's breasts the whole time, and some of the characters are very annoying and whiny. Plus, the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that it just makes you want to throw something at the screen. Last, but not least the ending is terrible. I don't want to give it away, in case you actually are strange enough to see this piece of junk.

{"value":"Oh just what I needed,another movie about 19th century England. Which is pretty much like regular England,only nobody's vandalising football stadiums.In this picturesque setting of lords,dames and other randomly chosen titles,Charlotte Gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as Jane Eyre,from that novel nobody has ever read willingly.Jane usually hangs out in Mr.Rochester's crib,where she tries to teach a French girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time.One day,Mr.Rochester(William Hurt on auto-pilot)comes back to fall in love with Jane and all that,but there's still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic.Oops,that wasn't in the brochure.After some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire(they probably rented the set),the movie finally comes to an end.Everything looked really authentic,that's something

{"value":"Val Kilmer, solid performance. Dylan McDermott, solid performance. Josh Lucas, solid performance. Three very engaging actors giving decent performances. The problem is, who cares about the plot? John Holmes. Infamous for his well-endowments, a drug addict, and a guy who, despite contracting AIDS, continued to make adult films, just does not make an intriguing character.<br /><br />The story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80's in Los Angelos to which Holmes was linked, arrested and charged with murder, and who ultimately was acquitted. Just like in the case of O.J., the guilt factor, regardless of the outcome, ranged quite high in the \"He did it\" zone.<br /><br />There is no one to sympathize with in this film, as everyone is a self-serving criminal.

{"value":"I remember loving this show when I was a kid. I thought the helicopter was the coolest thing I've seen. It was ultra high-tech for it's time. It could repel enemy fire, do all sorts of acrobatics in the air, and take down nearly anything in it's way. Now I go back and watch it today and am surprised how lousy this show really is. The casts members are hardly compelling, there are a lot of cheesy moments, and the fight scenes are incredibly fake looking. And nearly every ending has the same helicopter fighting crap with the obvious reuse of grainy low quality stock footage. Lot of the footages appear to date from the Vietnam War era.<br /><br />Airwolf has basically the same theme as Knight Rider, except the crime-fighting vehicle of choice is a helicopter instead of a car. After watching a few episodes, I found myself utterly bored.

{"value":"Madhur has given us a powerful movie Chandni Bar in the past. His next film Page 3 was one of the worst movies of all time. It apparently tells the story of some high class people in India. After seeing a scene where the man forces another man for sexual reasons to Star in a Movie. I felt like spitting and breaking the DVD. Coincidently i did. The reason why was the movie contains scenes of child pornography and molestation. I literally vomited and was shocked to see a movie showing naked children. Very disturbing stuff, there was no need to show the children fully naked. One of the rich guys likes to kidnap poor children and sell them to foreign people, British men in this movie. I am shocked to know this film was a Hit in parts of India, otherwise Super Flop in UK, USA and Australia.
