{"value":"This is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate. It looks as if it were shot on a back lot in California instead of where Jack Slade lived and died, Idaho, Colorado Territories, and Montana. It fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious 'bad man,' 'good man.' The script is horrible; there is very little direction, and lousy acting. Dorothy Malone is completely wasted as his wife. Mark Steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious Jack Slade. In real life, Jack Slade was a very good stage line superintendent. He was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking. When drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in Virginia City, Montana. To insure that he could never terrorize them again, vigilantes lynched Jack Slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately. This is a horrible movie. I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how Hollywood butches history at will, even to this day.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","veri","bad","western","mainli","becaus","it","be","histor","inaccur","it","look","a","if","it","be","shoot","on","a","back","lot","in","california","instead","of","where","jack","slade","live","and","die","idaho","colorado","territori","and","montana","it","fiction","everyth","that","be","know","about","thi","mysteri","bad","man","good","man","the","script","be","horribl","there","be","veri","littl","direct","and","lousi","act","dorothi","malon","be","complet","wast","a","hi","wife","mark","steven","never","seem","to","know","how","to","portrai","thi","mysteri","jack","slade","in","real","life","jack","slade","be","a","veri","good","stage","line","superintend","he","be","fear","by","hi","local","townsman","for","hi","hard","drink","when","drink","he","would","start","fight","and","caus","other","problem","in","virginia","citi","montana","to","insur","that","he","can","never","terror","them","again","vigilant","lynch","jack","slade","after","he","ignor","their","warn","to","leav","town","immedi","thi","be","a","horribl","movi","i","can","not","recommend","anyon","to","watch","thi","movi","other","than","to","see","how","hollywood","butch","histori","at","will","even","to","thi","dai"],"filtered":["thi","veri","bad","western","mainli","becaus","histor","inaccur","look","shoot","back","lot","california","instead","jack","slade","live","die","idaho","colorado","territori","montana","fiction","everyth","know","thi","mysteri","bad","man","good","man","script","horribl","veri","littl","direct","lousi","act","dorothi","malon","complet","wast","hi","wife","mark","steven","never","seem","know","portrai","thi","mysteri","jack","slade","real","life","jack","slade","veri","good","stage","line","superintend","fear","hi","local","townsman","hi","hard","drink","drink","start","fight","caus","problem","virginia","citi","montana","insur","never","terror","vigilant","lynch","jack","slade","ignor","warn","leav","town","immedi","thi","horribl","movi","recommend","anyon","watch","thi","movi","see","hollywood","butch","histori","even","thi","dai"],"filtered2":["veri","bad","western","mainli","becaus","histor","inaccur","look","shoot","back","lot","california","instead","jack","slade","live","die","idaho","colorado","territori","montana","fiction","everyth","know","mysteri","bad","man","good","man","script","horribl","veri","littl","direct","lousi","act","dorothi","malon","complet","wast","wife","mark","steven","never","seem","know","portrai","mysteri","jack","slade","real","life","jack","slade","veri","good","stage","line","superintend","fear","local","townsman","hard","drink","drink","start","fight","caus","problem","virginia","citi","montana","insur","never","terror","vigilant","lynch","jack","slade","ignor","warn","leav","town","immedi","horribl","recommend","anyon","watch","see","hollywood","butch","histori","even","dai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,9,14,15,16,21,22,26,35,42,45,63,71,72,74,75,77,80,89,102,103,107,116,117,132,152,158,167,171,193,230,232,263,293,298,300,403,450,453,469,475,499,527,595,667,669,717,763,770,777,812,916,953,987,1117,1194,1211,1449,1807,2545,2860,2970,3238,3725,4109,4541,5510,7843],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,9,14,15,16,21,22,26,35,42,45,63,71,72,74,75,77,80,89,102,103,107,116,117,132,152,158,167,171,193,230,232,263,293,298,300,403,450,453,469,475,499,527,595,667,669,717,763,770,777,812,916,953,987,1117,1194,1211,1449,1807,2545,2860,2970,3238,3725,4109,4541,5510,7843],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,1.1175081997259209,3.6001823395697077,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.6649848339420377,1.463169012899134,3.2439908614907673,3.632592212924433,1.8729627573220065,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,1.9486336368009016,1.9742250248702675,1.9463902258768238,1.9951803900462557,1.9940046109572438,2.087553710177271,2.098582041218749,2.1439533986393955,2.2466628996789315,2.2797301185117202,2.253494045787767,2.3131195476980753,2.3106972614914807,2.4609576687888097,2.373087554090762,2.517840471459249,5.424276438599839,2.8377834061292515,2.902686292364678,2.9012296278682137,2.7819920465008363,2.932274249550174,6.378794038853654,3.469984576472117,3.2872346624216657,3.328770687675578,3.3721070011625462,3.3814747511661465,3.439602492783994,3.6284289511740746,7.3304858485935815,3.7099788181381825,3.7398317812878634,3.7465885637507435,4.0536665665501035,16.34582555749238,3.952924996748572,4.100845126825194,4.1302590120314875,4.035401218572811,4.224077767249142,4.499089986959872,4.274508620876034,4.566029469634981,5.143104478942172,5.21405621491

{"value":"I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival, with the great Dr. Uwe Boll in attendance.<br /><br />The film is, simply put, very, very bad. And no, not in the usual Uwe Boll \"so bad it's actually entertaining\" way, but just plain bad. The plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life (because of a past criminal record, apparently), can't get a job, and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife. This man turns to his cult-leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus. Al Qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys, and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence.<br /><br />The acting is awful (except for Dave Foley, who really tries, despite it all), the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion, and people taking a poo.

{"value":"May the saints preserve us, because this movie is not going to help.<br /><br />Someone with access needs to e-mail Mel Gibson and tell him we need a faithful production of Beowulf. Something that actually has something in common with the epic poem that is the foundation for all modern western literature.<br /><br />The recent (since 2000) versions of Beowulf make we wonder two things. First, why is there so much interest in the story. Second, why are all these filmmakers squandering mountains of cash on this crap.<br /><br />The only reason this got a two is that the version with Lambert in it (Beowulf 2000) was worse and needed the 1.<br /><br />What is even worse, some people will watch this and get the wrong idea about the poem. How can an industry where Peter Jackson gets a literary conversion to film so right can get it so wrong.

{"value":"This is the kind of movie i fear the most. Arrogant and Irresponsible, it presents a sketch of the colombian conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all Colombian people. The performances are godawul, from Grisales (her naked scene is absolutely pitiful), to Bejarano, to Fanny Mickey (who looks right out of a Tim Burton nightmare), to Díaz, who makes a notable effort to bring life to a character so one-dimensional, so cliched and so badly written all he´s left to work with is a mustache. Not to mention the gratuitous ending, a gore fest so cheesy that it would make Ed Wood cringe. It fails in all ways, cinematography, art direction, costumes, makeup, editing, and most of all directing, Jorge Alí Triana has always been a lousy filmmaker but at least his previous movies had some dignity. I can't say anything good about this waste of money, except that i hope Colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty, integrity and responsability from this mean-intended

{"value":"Ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie? Or any taiwanese movie? Propably for a reason. This one was a really boring one, even though it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels.<br /><br />Having read other peoples thoughts, I was looking forward for some violence and gore, but there's not much at all. Some blood puking and other lame stuff, if you are waiting for graphic gore or any gruesome effects you will be disappointed. They clearly didn't use the eel exploding and other things to their maximum potent.<br /><br />Pretty much nothing good about this movie; a single character that wasn't completely bland and a few OK black magic spells, like the eel one. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect didn't work at all, the most horrifying thing was an albino girl (not that scary really).

{"value":"The premise of an African-American female Scrooge in the modern, struggling city was inspired, but nothing else in this film is. Here, Ms. Scrooge is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits. There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved. Part of the problem is that story's roots don't translate well into the urban setting of this film, and the script fails to make the update work. Also, the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly, the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end. This is a message film that doesn't know when to quit. In the title role, the talented Cicely Tyson gives an overly uptight performance, and at times lines are difficult to understand. The Charles Dickens novel has been adapted so many times, it's a struggle to adapt it in a way that makes it fresh and relevant, in spite of its very relevant

{"value":"I just wondering what is the purpose of making movies like this? the profit? and to whom they are referring what intelligence must use your brain to watch something like this crap? This movie is watchable by under 3 years old children if you are adults don't try to watch it. Thats the reason i think Hollywood started to use cartoons in movies with actors like this you must forget the art of cinema , be sure that you ll have tons of pop corn to consume for time to pass till this movie ends also get many cola's hamburgers your laptop your cellphone this movie can be used easily in a restaurant but for sure not in a theater , my dog who is always next to my family when watching a movie left the building.The sure thing is that this movie is referring to people with no demands from the cinema art.The only thing that this movie can be used is for watching it when

{"value":"Probable reasons why so many people on this site have enjoyed this:<br /><br />1. They might not have read the book. 2. They might enjoy gore and violence in a film. 3. They might be very young and therefore not understand the violence. 4. People might not understand how somehow more scary and more violent it is compared to the original book. 5. There are sure to be many other reasons not covered here.<br /><br />The only thing I liked about this film is the song \"'Bright Eyes\".<br /><br />If perchance, you happen to be one of those people who has read the book, enjoys calm and peaceful films without violence and are quite old and understand scariness and violence, you are sure not to like this. Otherwise you will almost definitely enjoy this.<br /><br />Like in the book, a rabbit called Fiver in an unsuspecting warren warns of terrible danger to come.

{"value":"I managed to grab a viewing of this with the aid of MST3K, and oh boy, even with the riffing this movie was excruciatingly bad. Imagine someone whose competence with a camera could be out done by a monkey.<br /><br />The highlights (what little there were) came from the special effects, which were \"OK\". The acting for the most part was also \"OK\"; though nothing special, it was of a higher quality than other B-Movies I have seen in the past.<br /><br />The rest of this movie is dismally bad, The camera work often looks like they've just put the camera man on roller skates and pushed him along. The story (if it can be called that) is so full of holes it's almost funny, It never really explains why the hell he survived in the first place, or needs human flesh in order to survive. The script is poorly written and the dialogue verges on just plane stupid. The climax to movie (if there is one) is absolutely laughable.<br /><br />If you can't find the MST3K version, avoid this at all

{"value":"I simply cant understand why all these relics from the Ceausescu era refuse to let go. One can see clearly how frustrated they were during the commie censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their movies, and now they imagine its dunno what big deal of artsy-fartsy freedom so fill the screen with people defecating, urinating, vomiting, swearing, and any other kinds of hideousness imaginable. THIS IS NOT CINEMA, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS! This is simply visual perversion. Forget about Bunuels Chien Andalou, about David Lynch, about Forman and neorealism and other movie makers who were able to work with an aesthetics of ugliness. THOSE people were mastering their jobs - well, you Don't! Do us a favor, all you Daneliucs and Nicolaescus and Saizescus and Muresans and Marinescus and Margineanus and other obsolete old-timers, and leave us alone! Its bit time to see some Romanian MOVIES on screen, enough with your immature terribilisms!

{"value":"This movie is a perfect adaptation of the English Flick Unfaithful. Ashmit plays the role of Richard Gere, Emran that of Olivier and Malikka the perfect cheating wife role of Lane.They have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the Indian masses. <br /><br />Even then the movie has got the full traces of Unfaithful, though it couldn't catch up with the original. It was a cheap soft porn of the Bollywood lovers, where Mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show. Emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer. In the future if the Indian Directors plan to remake a English movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the Indian Censors. Though the film bombed at the box office, the actors got the undue recognition. In future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a Oscar nominated film. <br /><br />All said, this is not a family film, so take the extra caution while watching it at home with

{"value":"This Kiyoshi Kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild, and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard. But all in all, the movie is incredibly stupid, with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer, only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes. Then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous Asian lady ghost, and has no idea why (and neither does the viewer). As other murders are committed, he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found, and this ghost still haunts him for some reason. Not only is the plot completely stupid, the lady ghost is more funny than anything, especially when she suddenly flies across the city, like Wonder Woman. And the ending makes little sense, in fact, the whole movie makes little sense, and I can't recommend it at all. If it didn't take itself so serious, I would think it was supposed to be a black comedy.

{"value":"What? Is Jamie Foxx supposed to be funny?Does he really believe he is funny?Well, it's funny watching his confidence in being funny.The man has no identity whatsoever...I mean you can immediately see who his idols are, Denzel Washington and Martin Lawrence, because he tries really hard to imitate them in most of his movies.The only problem is that he does it bad, uneven, and what comes out are some parts where he somewhat looks like Denzel, with that macho-s**t attitude and then abruptly goes to being Martin Lawrence, the funny and clumsy-silly comic. There's no personal touch to all that, I mean he contributes nothing to the personality he tries to sell, and I'm sure he has nothing to say personally. He really is Mr. Dull-boy in person.<br /><br />I was really hoping Hollywood, and the black community in America would find somebody better to launch into super stardom, like Don Cheadle for example,

{"value":"Daraar got off to a pretty good start. The first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. Other than that, the first half of the movie is a total BORE. All the first half of the movie is about is Rishi Kapoor falling head over heels in love with Juhi Chawla. By the way, don't you think he's a little old for her???<br /><br />Things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when Juhi tells us about her previous husband; and wow what a lunatic is he! He was an over-protective, neat-freak with a really HOT TEMPER! He used to beat up poor Juhi for no good reason! One of the reasons I really don't like this movie is because I can't stand to see Juhi (my favorite actress) get so abused. This film in general has WAY too much abuse and bloodshed; I find it so sickening!!!<br /><br />Anyway, all I'm trying to say is if you're thinking about renting Daraar, you should put it right back

{"value":"I admit to having been a fan of the original stage production. I never saw the movie version until very lately on cable, and watched it with anticipation, to see my memories brought alive again, because I adored the original show. Imagine my dismay.<br /><br />This has to be the worst translation of a Broadway show to film ever made. They changed the story, they changed the songs, they lost the soul. I was expecting a trip down memory lane, singing to the extraordinarily touching Music and the Mirror, At the Ballet, and Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen. Not! Not only did they adulterate the music to an almost unrecognizable point, but they messed up the storyline, adding songs and exterior plotlines (hello Cassie and Michael Douglas) not present in the original, and injecting \"drama\" where it wasn't necessary. The original had enough pathos on its own. If you were a fan of the original Broadway show, don't bother.

{"value":"I really wanted to like this movie a lot more than I did. That's because I love wacky foreign comedies--particularly the strange ones that catch you completely by surprise. However, although this one frequently caught me by surprise, these were almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park in that nearly EVERY social norm was violated until the only ones left to broach were too sick to be funny. For example, after exploring adultery, drug abuse (of nearly every sort--ranging from pot, heroin, speed to glue sniffing), prostitution, S&M, suicide, murder, etc., the movie got to the hilarious(?) topic of pedophilia. Mom encouraged her one son (who looked about 12 years-old) to sleep with neighboring men. In fact, at one point in the movie she gives this boy to the dentist in lieu of payment for dental work! Funny?! You've got to be kidding. This movie just goes too far and delves into the \"black hole of comedy\".

{"value":"This is the second movie I saw for Horrorfest this past weekend, The Gravedancers being the first. Gravedancers was better. I can only guess from watching this that the production must have been quite limited. I will admit the story started out interesting but really fizzled for me in the end. We weren't really given time to sympathize or understand any of the characters which only made each of their erratic characteristics even more annoying. I have to mention that there was also a bit of mis-casting with a 12-year-old boy acting as Sheriff. The only reason I sat through the whole film was to find out what the big secret was, which turned out to not be all that interesting. Some more background about the family would have helped but they didn't really seem like a family at all to begin with.<br /><br />To me, this film is so amateur that I couldn't even see putting it on DVD. The four rating is for the initial potential the story might have had.

{"value":"I am a huge Jane Austen fan and I ordered the movie from Amazon.UK just so I could see it without waiting forever for it to come to the U.S. I really should have saved my money. What is with Anne running after Wentworth? The whole point of Anne Elliot's character is that she was quiet and refined. She is not impulsive and vulgar. And Mary, was she suffering from a stroke or something? Her speech wasn't normal, nor was her walking normal. There was no chemistry between the two main characters which made their whole \"romance\" completely unbelievable. In the final scene they even have Sally Hawkins wearing the same dress Amanda Root wore during the letter scene. The same clothes do not make it the same movie. In my opinion they didn't watch the 1995 version, which even though it had it's flaws, it did stay pretty close to the book. The book, I don't even think they read it. This is kind of like a Cliff's Notes movie of Persuasion.

{"value":"1st watched 5/26/2002 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Michael Almereyda): Weird story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. At least I think that was the relationship. A kind of eerie quality is held throughout this film not unlike Stephen King's The Shining. The difference is that there was campiness in Nicholson's performance that isn't at all in this film. This is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one-liners and attempts at litening up the mood don't work at all. The performances are not the problem here, but the story is. Everything doesn't seem to come together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of pieces of information and no real understanding of what happened in the film. There is a very small throwaway performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which, of course, gives him top-billing in an attempt to sell the film.

{"value":"... and yet, we were told, there was another hour and 20 minutes left to go.<br /><br />Why, oh, why wasn't there an editor to tell the writer/director to snip, snip, snip? Apparently that writer/director has previously done shorts; as a short, this would have been okay. But the lack of dialogue starts to grate after twenty minutes. The lack of much music glares. The background noises (talking, traffic, and especially a ubiquitous helicopter) get old really fast. But the worst failure is in story. There is precious little beyond a short.<br /><br />After an hour we saw variations of the same scene over and over again. I nearly screamed at the screen, \"We get it, we get it!!!!!\" It's amazing that after that left the theatre, we could drive home, watch the Daily Show and parts of the Colbert Report, get ready for bed,and know that the audience was STILL trapped in the theatre.<br /><br />It's not enough to indulge your vision.

{"value":"A pretty worthless made for television movie that pretty much follows the killer insect script. Ants mysteriously turn into killer ants near a hotel. I think it is from the hotel food because the sewage from the hotel kitchen drains directly into the ant bed. There is a lack of suspense in this film and it is not scary either. Watching a bunch of ants sting their victims is not very terrifying.<br /><br />Spoilers section The stupidity of the hero is near incredible. He is told that the health inspector that the ants could not be the hero. It has to be a mysterious virus. After the inspector says this, the hero takes his bulldozer and wrecks the huge ant colony. This disturbs the millions of ants and traps the people in the hotel.<br /><br />End spoilers Overall, this movie is extremely lame. I don't understand why it got a DVD release when so many deserving movies have none. My only guess for the DVD release is that Suzanne Summers is featured in the film.

{"value":"Like so many media experiments, this amateurish effort contains seeds of a very interesting social commentary. In the 5+ years since it was released, the premise has been made less outrageous by real world events in software development, and I found it less boring than the previous commentator for that reason, I imagine... The director clearly is a fan of Hitchcock, and it's too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention. One can almost see the exclamation points and capital letters on a yellowing page.<br /><br />I have to admit I found it rather entertaining for all these reasons and more. Sometimes the slick has less to offer us, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in deconstructing it for education purposes.

{"value":"Well, EYEboy, I must say that it pleases me to no end when someone singles me out and tries to make fun of me, especially when it is someone who seems as intelligent as you do. My favorite part of your post was \"But no big bang-bang good-guy bad-guy here, kimosabe. Me suggest you stick to movie with lotsa bang bang.\"<br /><br />Well said! I do like action movies, especially if they are well done, but I also like movies that don't have a whole lot of action, as long as THEY are well done. I'm sorry, but Secret's and Lies does not fit into that category and is simply a very bad movie. I really don't see very many non-American films, so maybe I was spoiled, and didn't realize how bad foreign films really were when I saw Secrets and Lies. Perhaps if I judge foreign movies by a different standard I could some day see how Secrets and Lies could possibly be one of the highest rated movies on the IMDB. Hmm...

{"value":"What more can I say? The acting was, almost without exception, amateurish. The directing and continuity were pitiful. The sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious. One of the features on the DVD was labeled \"Gag Reel\" but that could have been a description of a viewer's reaction to most of the movie.<br /><br />One of the most amusing things was in the director's comments on the DVD. He said, with a straight face, that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast - and that he had succeeded. With delusions like that it's easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster. The darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit (per the 'making of' feature on the DVD) and rather looked it. The mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store.

{"value":"Generally, I've found that if you don't hear about a movie prior to seeing it on DVD, there's probably a good reason for it. I hadn't heard about this movie at all until I was in a Blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf. Since all the good movies had already been rented out (the ones I wanted to see, anyway), I figured I'd give this one a shot.<br /><br />It's really not much different than other movies in the genre, such as The Singles Ward or the R.M. If you're into those type movies, you'll probably enjoy this.<br /><br />However, if you're not a mormon, this movie probably won't appeal to you. There's no way to avoid the overtly religious (mormon) message contained within, and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy. Ultimately, if you don't fall within the mormon demographic, you're probably better off watching something else.<br /><br />Admittedly, there were some very funny moments in the film, but I didn't

{"value":"There are times when finishing a film one wishes to have a refund for the time just spent. This was one of those times. I almost gave up with only 15 minutes left to endure... and I wish I had...<br /><br />The pace that a man goes from a straight-laced, controlled life to one of complete spinelessness and irresponsibility could never be this rapid.<br /><br />From a graduation celebration to the predictable ending Tristan Price (Jesse Metcalfe) man of privilege and culture allows himself to be seduced by a woman, by violence, and by mind altering substances. Of course, the woman part is understandable when observing the talents of the beautiful April (Nathalie Kelley). But the in for a penny in for a pound aspect of the drugs, violence and dedication to a person he has just met is impossible to understand.<br /><br />Frankly, besides being able to stare at Nathalie Kelley and Monica Keena, this film has no redeeming qualities.

{"value":"A less-than-subtle poke at the beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church is given a darker shade of death near the end of the show. Throughout the show, dark humour plays a medium through which several commonly heard rhetoric questions are asked, especially \"If God is so good, why does he allow evil to exist in the world?\"<br /><br />Diane Keaton is excellent in her role as an exaggerated version (though some might disagree) of they stereotyped religious teacher who spouts the \"company line\" and condemns half the world to burn in Hell. To celebrate her school's 25th anniversary, she invites her first students to return and perform their Christmas pageant.<br /><br />However, when the quartet \"update\" their play to parody Sister Mary's \"fallacious\" teachings, the nun is pushed over the edge, sending the story spiralling into a chain of unhappy events. The ending finally leaves the audience with a sick feeling in their hearts.<br /><br />Not recommended.

{"value":"The reviewer from Poland must be a feminist, for she finds \"Young Catherine\" to be a great film and historically accurate. Nothing could be further from the truth. As a practicing Russian historian for many, many years I took exception with YC at almost every turn, and in particular the politically correct depiction of her as the boss who single-handed moved Russia into a direction of dominance.

So long as she did not challenge them she was able/ permitted to indulge her cultural wishes (filling up the Hermitage with art treasures, etc.). There are so many proofs that she was not \"great,\" but in this area of post-modern revisionism proof is not very popular. YC is only a costume drama, a bit of fluff from Ted Turner that, like \"Peter the Great\" in 1986, is one more example of how badly Russia is portrayed in the West.","finished_norm":["the","review","from","poland","must","be","a","feminist","for","she","find","young","catherin","to","be","a","great","film","and","histor","accur","noth","can","be","far","from","the","truth","a","a","practic","russian","historian","for","mani","mani","year","i","take","except","with","yc","at","almost","everi","turn","and","in","particular","the","polit","correct","depict","of","her","a","the","boss","who","singlehand","move","russia","into","a","direct","of","domin","the","truth","she","be","onli","bring","to","stpetersburg","to","be","a","wife","and","mother","and","find","she","have","to","bond","with","the","dvorian","the","boyar","and","the","militari","just","to","surviv","so","long","a","she","do","not","challeng","them","she","be","abl","permit","to","indulg","her","cultur","wish","fill","up","the","hermitag","with","art","treasur","etc","there","be","so","mani","proof","that","she","be","not","great","but","in","thi","area","of","postmodern","revision","proof","be","not","veri","popular","yc","be","onli","a","costum","drama","a","bite","of","fluff","from","ted","turner","that","like","peter","the","great","in","be","on","much","exampl","of","how","badli","russia","be","portrai","in","the","west"],"filtered":["review","poland","must","feminist","find","young","catherin","great","film","histor","accur","noth","far","truth","practic","russian","historian","mani","mani","year","take","except","yc","almost","everi","turn","particular","polit","correct","depict","boss","singlehand","move","russia","direct","domin","truth","onli","bring","stpetersburg","wife","mother","find","bond","dvorian","boyar","militari","surviv","long","challeng","abl","permit","indulg","cultur","wish","fill","hermitag","art","treasur","etc","mani","proof","great","thi","area","postmodern","revision","proof","veri","popular","yc","onli","costum","drama","bite","fluff","ted","turner","like","peter","great","much","exampl","badli","russia","portrai","west"],"filtered2":["review","poland","must","feminist","find","young","catherin","great","histor","accur","noth","far","truth","practic","russian","historian","mani","mani","year","take","except","yc","almost","everi","turn","particular","polit","correct","depict","boss","singlehand","move","russia","direct","domin","truth","onli","bring","stpetersburg","wife","mother","find","bond","dvorian","boyar","militari","surviv","long","challeng","abl","permit","indulg","cultur","wish","fill","hermitag","art","treasur","etc","mani","proof","great","area","postmodern","revision","proof","veri","popular","yc","onli","costum","drama","bite","fluff","ted","turner","like","peter","great","exampl","badli","russia","portrai","west"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,11,15,31,38,49,50,51,57,85,96,99,101,102,131,135,141,154,176,233,250,263,275,307,382,397,399,429,448,454,463,469,553,575,758,760,776,832,880,885,917,951,953,984,1011,1090,1156,1234,1249,1463,1465,1602,1976,2032,2264,2323,2507,2647,2991,3308,3684,3771,3908,4831,5866,7930],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,11,15,31,38,49,50,51,57,85,96,99,101,102,131,135,141,154,176,233,250,263,275,307,382,397,399,429,448,454,463,469,553,575,758,760,776,832,880,885,917,951,953,984,1011,1090,1156,1234,1249,1463,1465,1602,1976,2032,2264,2323,2507,2647,2991,3308,3684,3771,3908,4831,5866,7930],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.982619630677639,1.2000607798565692,1.4070669811451506,3.038623282696244,1.6920303308087352,5.153983156711065,5.141969792492947,1.834162586674748,2.011190219103739,2.0390708128715254,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.087553710177271,2.2512118082053005,2.366244071437088,2.2657547357741192,2.348499626138016,2.5040471493269134,2.6102777977348763,2.6812935439488212,2.902686292364678,2.7832848715031413,2.8767855639325206,3.235085203598255,3.3176717946075294,3.129115117668582,3.2872346624216657,3.2681460658591432,3.2556198060399626,3.3467891931782563,3.328770687675578,3.454678155189441,3.6314455447135003,7.648184249811207,3.850067611308864,3.770603439954617,3.7987743169213135,4.110553940952155,3.9782428047328615,3.9363956947973615,4.004218291136122,4.1302590120314875,4.263079925052412,4.086456389373095,4.339813719283801,4.2860694432771105,4.74221603786142,4.499089986959872,4.550761997504193,4.484804029712395,4.613282354485526,9.912454211224713,4.9909126636002465,5.143104478942172,5.501738287366237,5.3064295350454715,5.604922523601468,5.444579873526289,5.822646007446338,5.878215858601149,11.814406790948803,5.850044981634453,6.137727054086234,6.389041482367141,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.7177072151533086E-5,4.685894612491617E-5,4.7223229748729364E-5,4.6950373424155295E-5,4.695114265316363E-5,

{"value":"You can often tell a movie didn't turn out like it should by the heavy use of a narrator. This film features this device throughout. Richard Jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which he must be mistaking for genuine art-house. Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance. Everyone else is okay.<br /><br />Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.<br /><br />The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes.

{"value":"I love the book, \"Jane Eyre\" and have seen many versions of it. All have their strong points and their faults. However, this was one of the worst I have seen. I didn't care about Jane or Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Gainsbourg (Jane) was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part, but she had no emotion in any of her lines. I couldn't imagine what Mr. Rochester saw in her. <br /><br />That brings us to Mr. Rochester. William Hurt had even less emotion than Jane, if that were possible. How two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery, but it certainly didn't hold my attention. Perhaps the director (Zeffrelli) fell asleep during the production.<br /><br />The Timothy Dalton (too handsome for Mr. Rochester!) version is far more faithful to the book, but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr. Rochester in the 1997 A/E version (which is NOT all that true to the book).<br /><br />Trying to find something positive about this movie: Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her
