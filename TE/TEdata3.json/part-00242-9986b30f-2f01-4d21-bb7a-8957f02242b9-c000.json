{"value":"I've seen many of Guy Maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me a headache. John Gurdebeke's editing is way too frenetic, and, apart from a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does nothing but interfere with the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.<br /><br />Another thing I disliked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin's earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gave the movies an overriding feeling of humanity. This one seemed more like harshness for harshness' sake.<br /><br />As I'm required to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I will mention that the actor playing \"Guy Maddin\" does manage to ape his facial expressions pretty well.","finished_norm":["i","have","see","mani","of","gui","maddin","film","and","like","much","of","them","but","thi","on","liter","give","me","a","headach","john","gurdebek","edit","be","wai","too","frenet","and","apart","from","a","tourdeforc","sequenc","show","a","line","of","head","snap","to","look","at","on","object","doe","noth","but","interfer","with","the","actor","abil","to","commun","with","the","audiencebr","br","anoth","thing","i","dislik","about","thi","film","be","that","it","seem","much","brutal","than","maddin","earli","worksthough","hi","film","have","alwai","have","dark","elem","hi","sympathi","for","the","charact","give","the","movi","a","overrid","feel","of","human","thi","on","seem","much","like","harsh","for","harsh","sakebr","br","a","i","be","requir","to","add","much","line","of","text","befor","imdb","will","accept","my","review","i","will","mention","that","the","actor","plai","gui","maddin","doe","manag","to","ap","hi","facial","express","pretti","good"],"filtered":["see","mani","gui","maddin","film","like","much","thi","liter","give","headach","john","gurdebek","edit","wai","frenet","apart","tourdeforc","sequenc","show","line","head","snap","look","object","doe","noth","interfer","actor","abil","commun","audiencebr","br","anoth","thing","dislik","thi","film","seem","much","brutal","maddin","earli","worksthough","hi","film","alwai","dark","elem","hi","sympathi","charact","give","movi","overrid","feel","human","thi","seem","much","like","harsh","harsh","sakebr","br","requir","add","much","line","text","befor","imdb","accept","review","mention","actor","plai","gui","maddin","doe","manag","ap","hi","facial","express","pretti","good"],"filtered2":["see","mani","gui","maddin","like","liter","give","headach","john","gurdebek","edit","wai","frenet","apart","tourdeforc","sequenc","show","line","head","snap","look","object","doe","noth","interfer","actor","abil","commun","audiencebr","anoth","thing","dislik","seem","brutal","maddin","earli","worksthough","alwai","dark","elem","sympathi","charact","give","overrid","feel","human","seem","like","harsh","harsh","sakebr","requir","add","line","text","befor","imdb","accept","review","mention","actor","plai","gui","maddin","doe","manag","ap","facial","express","pretti","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,10,16,18,28,29,30,33,35,40,41,43,49,50,55,73,78,79,107,176,197,208,266,285,291,292,299,345,348,349,368,479,572,592,742,846,847,897,989,1061,1191,1261,1441,1515,1675,2162,2228,2296,3315,3504,3604,5841],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,10,16,18,28,29,30,33,35,40,41,43,49,50,55,73,78,79,107,176,197,208,266,285,291,292,299,345,348,349,368,479,572,592,742,846,847,897,989,1061,1191,1261,1441,1515,1675,2162,2228,2296,3315,3504,3604,5841],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.1238870241028365,1.1966138720291084,2.430631986809635,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,2.6728839783437044,1.4018535447685214,2.926338025798268,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,1.6608112036218214,1.6920303308087352,1.717994385570355,3.9073995778510735,1.8950689206770979,2.0064197866819473,1.9469506069506084,4.287906797278791,2.5040471493269134,2.558331832813986,2.6289494000279396,2.747702973022204,2.808171552082607,3.016831637578237,2.9752256367457734,2.7949961309240425,3.0022328381570844,3.0103169565570433,3.0568369721919364,3.1346146732346205,3.360519385990158,3.4933926673701317,3.509308122676031,3.7165362186843414,3.9201351739255808,3.900174431363043,3.8844878351953436,4.044492190274062,4.218628162481577,4.3215761317340196,4.383707912841026,5.129498826886393,4.605250182788262,4.706176101378222,5.143104478942172,5.039114765418124,10.128232135247083,5.541743621979936,5.604922523601468,5.672363804397,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.980185382672784E-5,6.933116360803293E-5,6.987014729441358E-5,6.946643683899486E-5,6.946757496835199E-5,6.937047318082022E-5,6.957679068776275E-5,6.93411468425691E-5,6.949705101851731E-5,7.710318441050879E-5,0.3977168336816658,6.922921494353099E-5,7.052134390988687E-5,7.152734637684146E-5,6.927969616487558E-5,6.908823697605022E-5,7.081155662512437E-5,6.958330950786256E-5,6.936742756118E-5,6.94249208253096E-5,7.009664765282922E-5,6.965224895970129E-5,6.97315586118358E-5,6.980668654521025E-5,7.034241700147624E-5,0.040739464878891574,0.0570673093576536,6.924979615437355E-5,6.925164874859521E-5,6.942709740908061E-5,7.090275411145122E-5,6.957927774926676E-5,0.46694753017361773,6.977499398999863E-5,6.932517144324246E-5,6.964515280907656E-5,6.925570588903296E-5,6.929663091574648E-5,6.908788987116163E-5,6.910581445721937E-5,6.926136324692544E-5,6.999192386859008E-5,6.963626549059329E-5,6.936094316289742E-5,7.020375135171711E-5,6.

{"value":"Fred Olen Ray is a lousy director, even as far as B movie directors go, but 'Haunting Fear' is probably one of his better films. Yes, it does butcher the great Poe story 'Premature Burial' and yes, it is badly paced and uneven throughout, but it is also pretty entertaining. Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a pretty, fragile housewife whose worthless husband (Jay Richardson) is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster (played by Robert Quarry). Delia Sheppard, a veteran of many early 90s soft-core movies, actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress. You will also enjoy small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic, Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes.

{"value":"i was enjoying this movie most of the time, but i kept getting the feeling that i was watching a children's movie. i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then, while filming, decided to add in some blood, nudity and language. it was a big let down. there's that believe the children magic that exists in movies like \"babe\" (the pig) or \"angels in the outfield\" that defeats the evil tooth fairy. the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. when i bought this movie, i thought it would be a b-film response to the dreadful darkness falls; somehow manage to make a better film with 1/4 of the money, but they don't. they made a worse film and will probably lose the

{"value":"This was a truly insipid film. The performances are third rate, and the dialogue is so stilted that at times it seemed to have just rolled over and died. My reason for renting this was simple: Find a movie with scriptwriting. I needed a visual aid for my presentation, so I figured why not use a clip? Boy was I wrong. After searching my local video store, I came upon this, where it was suspiciously titled \"Starstruck\". I thought, \"What the hey\", and decided to give it a try. Well, I was very unhappy with my results. There was maybe one scene I could use, and meanwhile, I was practically falling asleep because of the sheer banality of the flick. So.....I took this back and picked up Ed Wood. There's a movie I can use as an example.

{"value":"This film was pure pain. Sitting in the theater for x-amount of minutes, I was wondering when the film was going to start. All the setups were in place; typical love story, characters have to overcome their short-givings, villain has to emerge, but none of it ever initiated. By the time these things happened, I was already bored stiff and the devices were completely ineffective. In scenes that required immense tension and buildup, it felt like necessary frames were cut. Kid's stuff does not have to be this way. Children's films can be as riveting and engaging as adult ones. The excuse, \"hey , its for kids,\" is bull. I'll take \"Sword in the Stone\" any day. This was terrible. I'm getting the feeling that Disney will put out anything these days.

{"value":"\"How She Moves\" springs to life only when its high-energy, talented cast members are kicking up their heels and strutting their stuff for the camera. Otherwise, this stale strive-suffer-and-succeed story is low on energy, low on originality, and low on anything that might make the movie stand out from the dozens of other, likeminded films that have come before it.<br /><br />Rutina Wesley has modest appeal as the academically gifted inner-city youngster who finds that the best way to raise her private school tuition money is by entering step-dance competitions, but both she and her fellow actors are poorly served by uninspired screen writing and undistinguished direction. As noted earlier, the movie achieves some spark when the performers are up on stage dancing, but such moments are far too few and sadly fleeting.","finished_norm":["how","she","move","spring","to","life","onli","when","it","highenergi","talent","cast","member","be","kick","up","their","heel","and","strut","their","stuff","for","the","camera","otherwis","thi","stale","strivesufferandsucc","stori","be","low","on","energi","low","on","origin","and","low","on","anyth","that","mai","make","the","movi","stand","out","from","the","dozen","of","other","likemind","film","that","have","come","befor","itbr","br","rutina","weslei","have","modest","appeal","a","the","academ","gift","innerc","youngster","who","find","that","the","well","wai","to","rais","her","privat","school","tuition","monei","be","by","enter","stepdanc","competit","but","both","she","and","her","fellow","actor","be","poorli","serv","by","uninspir","screen","write","and","undistinguish","direct","a","note","earli","the","movi","achiev","some","spark","when","the","perform","be","up","on","stage","danc","but","such","moment","be","far","too","few","and","sadli","fleet"],"filtered":["move","spring","life","onli","highenergi","talent","cast","member","kick","heel","strut","stuff","camera","otherwis","thi","stale","strivesufferandsucc","stori","low","energi","low","origin","low","anyth","mai","make","movi","stand","dozen","likemind","film","come","befor","itbr","br","rutina","weslei","modest","appeal","academ","gift","innerc","youngster","find","well","wai","rais","privat","school","tuition","monei","enter","stepdanc","competit","fellow","actor","poorli","serv","uninspir","screen","write","undistinguish","direct","note","earli","movi","achiev","spark","perform","stage","danc","moment","far","sadli","fleet"],"filtered2":["move","spring","life","onli","highenergi","talent","cast","member","kick","heel","strut","stuff","camera","otherwis","stale","strivesufferandsucc","stori","low","energi","low","origin","low","anyth","mai","make","stand","dozen","likemind","come","befor","itbr","rutina","weslei","modest","appeal","academ","gift","innerc","youngster","find","well","wai","rais","privat","school","tuition","monei","enter","stepdanc","competit","fellow","actor","poorli","serv","uninspir","screen","write","undistinguish","direct","note","earli","achiev","spark","perform","stage","danc","moment","far","sadli","fleet"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,11,17,20,33,34,38,41,46,65,69,75,79,92,101,102,104,105,126,188,192,217,231,266,275,276,296,361,377,398,431,492,560,618,627,669,689,705,815,869,1045,1164,1170,1323,1373,1517,1549,1690,2151,2470,2665,2791,2877,3830,4856,4952,4980,5253,5286,6730],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,11,17,20,33,34,38,41,46,65,69,75,79,92,101,102,104,105,126,188,192,217,231,266,275,276,296,361,377,398,431,492,560,618,627,669,689,705,815,869,1045,1164,1170,1323,1373,1517,1549,1690,2151,2470,2665,2791,2877,3830,4856,4952,4980,5253,5286,6730],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,1.655771293751733,1.9073850067444174,2.127032521151058,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,2.0489535369135887,2.098582041218749,2.087553710177271,2.0728240170322856,2.1765612129984904,2.2391270689902285,2.5378812223426954,2.5318267134339894,7.834099588410218,2.7049353070058615,2.747702973022204,2.7832848715031413,2.7884729505849193,2.9504565686333644,3.0399731661399314,3.0602441305135506,3.143848349181566,3.1419947805322432,3.6016814428070463,3.4623020803001006,3.5642670069567886,3.477726550625732,3.7099788181381825,3.634471265630037,3.6284289511740746,3.7881170224473255,3.9161110236258554,4.1554492608600455,4.268777946167049,4.2860694432771105,4.383707912841026,4.443131333311827,4.550761997504193,4.528289141652134,4.74221603786142,5.064116067623542,5.156897801074508,5.274680836730892,5.408212229355414,5.390512652256013,5.7959777603641776,6.2980697041614135,6.255510089742618,6.137727054086234,6.255510089742618,6.2980697041614135,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.870051645401178E-5,5.83046851485019E-5,5.875794847914881E-5,5.84184444268669E-5,5.8419401547307006E-5,5.8337742898370954E-5,5.851124751962492E-5,5.831308064218906E-5,5.8444189705111874E-5,0.48455968540555827,0.31146107913448773,5.8218950473418406E-5,5.9305578313397566E-5,6.015158541961043E-5,5.826140312476937E-5,5.810039374396103E-5,5.954963538827484E-5,5.85167295818561E-5,5.8335181656283504E-5,5.8383531150057876E-5,5.894842605656418E-5,5.85747048533587E-5,5.8641401040993494E-5,5.8704580573447606E-5,5.915510807005279E-5,5.884574350828384E-5,6.131950677489047E-5,5.823625843358671E-5,5.8237816389881985E-5,5.838536156836998E-5,5.962632876034461E-5,5.851333903706657E-5,6.280911269063795E-5,5.867792842516387E-5,5.82996459819

{"value":"I was surprised when I saw this film. I'd heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel. How disappointed I was.<br /><br />How any true Jane Austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. The scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times, but also ruin the feel of the period. As for the cast: Gwyneth Paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine (but then any 'hot' American star would be questionable in the role), Toni Collette is miscast, and poor Ewan McGregor is made to look laughable!<br /><br />I really could not say a good thing about this film. I seem to be among the very few who don't rate it, but if you want my advice, see instead the TV production starring Kate Beckinsale - believe me, that is far preferable to this superficial

{"value":"I am a huge horror/splatter fan, I even enjoy horror films some people consider as stupid. I also like gore. The more the merrier as long as it has a point.<br /><br />After reading the other people's reviews on the site I was sure this film was going to be a little gem. But much to my disappointment it proved to be one of the most pointless films I've ever watched.<br /><br />The acting was terrible, the dialogs were stupid, the plot was pointless, the special effects were useless and the editing was probably done by someone who has been dead for the past 2 years. Usually i find that all these characteristics make a great b horror movie .

{"value":"This crap is like watching paint dry. I'm so disappointed because I was so eager to see it.<br /><br />There simply is no meaning to this film. If it were never made, no one would notice or care. It's hyped up because of all the big names in it, but if \"nobody's\" were in, nobody would give this film any love.<br /><br />Seriously, I was at the point where half-way through the film I would look at Vanessa Redgrave and think, \"Hurry up and die already!\" This is like the \"Joy Luck Club\" without any of the friggin' joy. It's the \"Ocean's 13\" (nothing but a big-named cast) of mother-daughter movies and completely anti-climatic...oh until it's finally over.<br /><br />I'm sure they'll all be nominated for

{"value":"In my opinion this movie advances no new thought. seems to me like taking a spear to a spear without looking to the side! the director seems to have an agenda! Duh! I find that his rational is lacking there does not seem to be room for the alternative view. I for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie lacks credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man/woman on the street. really now if you wish to cr5eate a credible alternative to a creed held onto for 2000+ years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs. I'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith, I for one am a non believer, but allow for the beliefs of others, and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and

{"value":"i can't say i liked this movie very much.it has some amusing moments,but it doesn't seem able to make up its mind whether it is a comedy or a drama.it doesn't really work as either.it's too light in tone to be a drama,and the amusing moments are few and far between.it also doesn't make a lot of sense.things seem to happen for no reason.and it's also extremely convoluted.i feel like they just made things up as they were going.if they had just taken a bit of time to explain things,this might have been a better movie.i would say the ending was anti climatic, but that would mean the rest of the movie had actually been building up to something,which it didn't.it just sorts ends,and that's that.i didn't find it boring,really,but like i said,there there just isn't any point.i'll give

{"value":"OK, the movie is good but I give it a 1 because the idea of a computer virus becoming an organic virus is pure fairy tale. This kind of crap just adds to those uncomputer savvy moron's paranoid delusions that a computer virus is exactly like an organic virus. First of all, strings of code and dozens of 1s and 0s add up to computer virus. An organic virus is much more complex, even though it's way tinier. Though, it's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic virus's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the RNA, then change your own RNA code. Explain to me how something like that could be processed from a monitor? Maybe the radiation has some effect on the user's cornea that turns your eyeballs into these viruses?

{"value":"I have not seen many low budget films i must admit, but this is the worst movie ever probably, the main character the old man talked like, he had a lobotomy and lost the power to speak more than one word every 5 seconds, a 5 year old could act better. The story had the most awful plot, and well the army guy had put what he thought was army like and then just went over the top, i only watched it to laugh at how bad it was, and hoped it was leading onto the real movie. I cant believe it was under the 2 night rental thing at blockbusters, instead of a please take this for free and get it out of our sight. I think there was one semi decent actor other than the woman, i think the only thing OK with the budget was the make up, but they show every important scene of the film in the beginning music bit.

{"value":"I am a 11th grader at my high school. In my Current World Affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch. So we did. I am firm believer that we went to the moon, being that my father works for NASA. Even though I think this movie is the biggest piece of crap I have ever watched, the guy who created it has some serious balls. First of all did he have to show JFK getting shot? And how dare he use all those biblical quotes. The only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates, which is good b/c in my class we have weekly debates. This movie did nothing to change my mind. I think he and Michael Moore should be working together and make another movie.

{"value":"I just saw this film last night in the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them. The film was simply awful - I say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives - it was awful. Matthew Modine's days as a leading man are way over. Gina Gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent - she should be ashamed of her participation in this film. Gloria Reuben had a weird little cameo in it - she should also be ashamed. The script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters. I highly doubt this will be picked up, but then again, people in Hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes.

{"value":"I have no idea as to which audience director George Schlatter hoped to sell this comedy-of-ills. With Redd Foxx in the central role and enough pimpy outfits and polyester to carpet the entire 1970s, \"Norman\" plays like a blaxploitation picture combined with any number of silly sitcom episodes involving comic misunderstandings, not to mention an elongated cameo by Waylon Flowers! Based on a play by Sam Bobrick and Ron Clark, this tale of an estranged married couple (Foxx and Pearl Bailey) learning the hard way that their son is secretly gay--and living with a mincing, prancing white homosexual--has enough limp-wristed jokes to shame any early episode of \"Three's Company\". Bailey keeps her dignity, and Foxx's sheer confusion is good for a couple of chuckles, but the rest of the performers are humiliated. * from

{"value":"I know that actors and actresses like to try different kinds of movies - hey, no one wants to get typecast - but Danny Glover, Brenda Fricker (happy birthday, Brenda!) and Christopher Lloyd should have known better than this. \"Angels in the Outfield\" is another movie in which everything seems lost until someone or something magically comes and saves the day. Do I even need to tell you how it ends? The movie is just plain lowly escapism (examples of high escapism are the various sci-fi movies from the '50s). If these movies had some political undertone - or at least offered us a new look at life - then they would be OK; this one is just pointless. Far closer to diabolical than angelic.

{"value":"American film makers decided to make a film they think is Japanese. The characters all badly represented, the actors are not even Japanese and the set is cheap, unreal and definitely doesn't represent Kyoto in Early 20ties and 30ties. Who ever read the book understand that the script writers didn't add any extra value to differentiate the movie from the script. Worse, they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs. Rob Marshall is using for his two main characters two well known Chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon. Marshall probably saw one Chinese movie and tho they represent Japanese culture. Seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more ridiculous.

{"value":"This is surely one of the worst films ever made and released by a major Hollywood studio. The plot is simply stupid. The dialog is written in clichés; you can complete a great many sentences in the script because of this. The acting is ridiculously bad, especially that of Rod Cameron. The \"choreography\" is silly and wholly unerotic. One can only pity the reviewer who saw 23-year-old Yvonne's dance as sexual; it's merely very bad choreography. The ballet scene in the film's beginning is especially ludicrous. If you are into bad movies and enjoy laughing at some of Hollywood's turkeys, this is for you. I bought the colorized version on VHS, making the movie even worse. Yvonne's heavy makeup, when colored, has her looking like a clown all the time. And she's the best part of this film.

{"value":"I like end-of-days movies. I like B-movies. I was hoping I would like this movie.<br /><br />I could ignore the poor effects, the often atrocious music, the cringe-inducing lines. I could ignore the unexplained events, and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject matter. I could ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys. None of these things kill the movie. What kills this movie is that it's just plain and simple boring. Nothing actually happens; almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators' morals on the viewers, at the cost of actually having a coherent story, or any kind of suspense.<br /><br />If you're looking for an entertaining B-movie, look elsewhere.

{"value":"First of all, the big named actors must need the money... The surgical scenes were laughable.... and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly absurd......Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplant....nor do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of instruments, heart lung equipment and sterile techniques... just a joke... couldn't concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes... no blood, no personnel and then the hero doc coming in and taking over... it is not a film for thinking adults....Also the budget must have been limited... the street scenes were OK but who was the technical adviser....Seems like it was directed by a total idiot..

{"value":"Why was this film made? Even keeping in mind the generous tax concessions that Australian film investors were given, there can be no reasonable explanation for this film being given the go-ahead. For goodness sakes, the actors cast in this film are Aussie b-grade celebs (not actors, people like John Michael 'Hollywood' Howson, the original drummer from the band in Hey Hey Its Saturday, and the voice-over guy in Countdown. But in saying that, this is still very watchable as long as you give it the brain attention it deserves : none. The script is bad (even for a self-confessed b-grade horror) and the acting and film quality is worse. It often looks as though it is a home movie, but even a home movie has 'realism'.

{"value":"Carly Pope plays JJ, a newly promoted Food Critic whose flamboyant, overbearing mother moves in with her. JJ, aghast at this turn of events, then blackmails restaurant owner, Alex, to entertain her mother in exchange for \"maybe\" reviewing his dying restaurant. Alex predictably falls for the daughter while warming to the mother. There are numerous problems with this movie, the characters are universally 2-dimensional. JJ is a self-serving, hateful character, her mother superficial and shallow. JJ's colleagues at the magazine are bitchy and opportunistic. The underlying message of an over-50 woman unable to make it on her own, without male assistance is bad, bad, BAD. The acting is uniformly dull, the script uninspired. The films only saving grace is the setting of New York City.

{"value":"I can't think of much to say about this film. <br /><br />This was an awful movie...I can't even tell you what made me decide to view it. It had SO few redeeming qualities that I don't even know where to begin.<br /><br />The plot moved from implausible to downright absurd. My entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because I could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done. By the end of the movie, I found myself feeling beyond relieved. <br /><br />The editing was poor, the acting was sub-par, and the storyline was weak. Francoise Robinson was cast as a Native American, even though she does not even closely resemble someone of Native American heritage. <br /><br />If a movie is going to be this idiotic, it should be laughably stupid -- at the very least. It wasn't.

{"value":"Fairly amusing piece that tries to show how smart Orcas are but in the meanwhile (and quite oblivious to them) makes the audience feel stupid by making the most ridiculous film. Richard Harris plays Quint.. I'm sorry, that's wrong, he plays Captain Nolan, a fisherman who catches sharks for a living, but is lured by the big catch, and tries to catch a killer whale. When the capture of a female killer whale goes awry (don't ask) it's mate (don't ask) goes on a rampage (don't ask) and starts STALKING Captain Nolan (Don't ask). Soon, Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common (don't ask). Pretty amazing film-making here folks. I got to tell you though, the beginning (with the whale noises and nothing much else) is pretty haunting and the end credits (with the most godawful song) is pretty

{"value":"Is it just me or is that kid really annoying?<br /><br />Hideos sister, spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so. As for him, well, I know he's a kid n all, but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree. So far I'm only half way through, and am fascinated by the story, but the people in it, let it down, I just hope it gets better by the end, as I can't not know what it's all about. Although, some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook, indicate everything is backwards, i.e. Dog is God, Live is Evil etc... just seems a little obvious at the moment, yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning, (As yet anyway) If my opinion changes at the end of the movie, I'll update this post, but if your reading this, then well......

{"value":"Now, I'm no film critic, but I truly hated \"September 11\". This film was, on a general basis, bad. With the exception of Alejandro González Iñárritu's segment, which was the most effective and direct about the subject matter, the short films were at best boring, and at worst offensive. The worst in my mind was Youssef Chahine's pretentious segment in which he compared Palestinian suicide bombers to American soldiers, even going so far as to suggest the suicide bombers were fighting for a greater cause. The segment was completely off topic and, considering Chahine's seeming lack of any decency whatsoever, a waste of my time and patience. The idea of getting eleven different directors from different countries to make a movie featuring their views on a tragedy was good on paper, but in practice, it was

{"value":"this movie let me down decidedly hard. it was a great concept that was ruined with a horrible script. The story just didn't flow and was disjointed at best. There were so many elements to this story that were not explained, or were forced into place with out any real thought. elements like the love story could have been expanded on a bit more, and the cannons need to be written in better. the whole main character growing up thing needed more about the training he was receiving and less standing around. everyone likes a good \"little guy overcomes\" story and this showed promise but with the scripting failures wasn't to be.

{"value":"Before watching this film, I could already tell it was a complete copy of Saw (complete with the shack-like place they were in and the black guy wanting someone to break his hand to get out of the cuffs). MJH's name on a movie would typically turn me away (ugh, can we say GROSS?!), but I still wanted to give it a try.<br /><br />Starting out, I was a bit interested. The acting is absolutely horrible and I found myself laughing at almost each reaction from the characters (especially the man that played \"Sulley\"). MJH was even worst, but I continued to watch.<br /><br />However, the ending was the biggest joke of them all! I seriously sat in shock thinking \"THAT was the ending?!

{"value":"I don't understand the positive comments made about this film. It is cheap and nasty on all levels and I cannot understand how it ever got made.<br /><br />Cartoon characters abound - Sue's foul-mouthed, alcoholic, layabout, Irish father being a prime example. None of the characters are remotely sympathetic - except, briefly, for Sue's Asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence! As desperately unattractive as they both are, I've no idea why either Rita and/or Sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like Bob - but given that they do, why should I be expected to care what happens to them? So many reviews keep carping on about how \"realistic\" it is.

{"value":"This film is awful. The screenplay is bad, the is script mediocre, and even the sex scenes are worthless. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely lacking. This movie was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (a la \"War of the Worlds\"), which is so disappointing after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey's brooding character displays one facial expression throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot are woefully lacking here; the few that do exist are simply anticlimactic. The only highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but it isn't enough to make up for the other shortcomings. The only circumstance under which a \"Basic Instinct 3\" should be made would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the
