{"value":"Two kinds of movies we like are (1) westerns, and (2) movies from 30 or 40 years ago. We ought to have liked A Man Called Sledge; BUT.....<br /><br />BUT... this picture is disagreeable, annoying and stupid from start to finish. Since there is nobody in the story (good or bad) to warm up to, there is nobody to motivate the necessary suspense to keep the viewer interested. No camaraderie among the guys trying to steal the gold, and no camaraderie among those trying to protect it. Sledge has a pretty girl friend, but there's no reason why she slobbers all over the guy or why she wants to be in the same room with this no-account pig.<br /><br />The film also suffers from an intrusive and gawdawful musical score, and from extremely bad writing and direction by Vic Morrow.<br /><br />Of the last 30 older movies rented from Netflix or Video Vault, this was the rock bottom, the only true dud in the bunch.","finished_norm":["two","kind","of","movi","we","like","be","western","and","movi","from","or","year","ago","we","ought","to","have","like","a","man","call","sledg","butbr","br","but","thi","pictur","be","disagre","annoi","and","stupid","from","start","to","finish","sinc","there","be","nobodi","in","the","stori","good","or","bad","to","warm","up","to","there","be","nobodi","to","motiv","the","necessari","suspens","to","keep","the","viewer","interest","no","camaraderi","among","the","gui","try","to","steal","the","gold","and","no","camaraderi","among","that","try","to","protect","it","sledg","have","a","pretti","girl","friend","but","there","no","reason","why","she","slobber","all","over","the","gui","or","why","she","want","to","be","in","the","same","room","with","thi","noaccount","pigbr","br","the","film","conjur","suffer","from","a","intrus","and","gawdaw","music","score","and","from","extrem","bad","write","and","direct","by","vic","morrowbr","br","of","the","last","old","movi","rent","from","netflix","or","video","vault","thi","be","the","rock","bottom","the","onli","true","dud","in","the","bunch"],"filtered":["two","kind","movi","like","western","movi","year","ago","like","man","call","sledg","butbr","br","thi","pictur","disagre","annoi","stupid","start","finish","sinc","nobodi","stori","good","bad","warm","nobodi","motiv","necessari","suspens","keep","viewer","interest","camaraderi","among","gui","try","steal","gold","camaraderi","among","try","protect","sledg","pretti","girl","friend","reason","slobber","gui","want","room","thi","noaccount","pigbr","br","film","conjur","suffer","intrus","gawdaw","music","score","extrem","bad","write","direct","vic","morrowbr","br","last","old","movi","rent","netflix","video","vault","thi","rock","bottom","onli","true","dud","bunch"],"filtered2":["two","kind","like","western","year","ago","like","man","call","sledg","butbr","pictur","disagre","annoi","stupid","start","finish","sinc","nobodi","stori","good","bad","warm","nobodi","motiv","necessari","suspens","keep","viewer","interest","camaraderi","among","gui","try","steal","gold","camaraderi","among","try","protect","sledg","pretti","girl","friend","reason","slobber","gui","want","room","noaccount","pigbr","conjur","suffer","intrus","gawdaw","music","score","extrem","bad","write","direct","vic","morrowbr","last","old","rent","netflix","video","vault","rock","bottom","onli","true","dud","bunch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,9,11,17,36,37,39,45,47,55,57,60,65,67,71,78,84,95,102,118,122,134,136,142,144,161,162,240,271,279,304,311,329,419,513,518,529,573,578,582,610,633,661,770,826,860,866,902,1570,1769,1802,1922,2752,3350,4257,4967,5417,6634,7060],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,9,11,17,36,37,39,45,47,55,57,60,65,67,71,78,84,95,102,118,122,134,136,142,144,161,162,240,271,279,304,311,329,419,513,518,529,573,578,582,610,633,661,770,826,860,866,902,1570,1769,1802,1922,2752,3350,4257,4967,5417,6634,7060],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,2.9360366939211433,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.8162961064622165,1.7064694353107215,3.9073995778510735,1.834162586674748,1.838176641236591,1.9073850067444174,1.9570915389266579,1.9214926742550966,2.0064197866819473,2.2212694515902225,2.0323326556775485,2.087553710177271,2.354379525480895,2.2489347673732487,2.2443961816702407,2.346825985579986,2.2844323215331563,2.2931108769894046,2.4323182980210873,2.3586007221245198,2.7666071276613566,2.757740698455715,2.7910771187233068,2.871119826396843,2.9203338091782562,2.951986790814132,3.1758963322079246,3.454678155189441,3.4101163271295305,3.4648563601051974,3.4623020803001006,3.575630765607104,3.7099788181381825,3.477726550625732,3.550241531602284,3.5727776966246974,4.0536665665501035,7.6408716274049855,3.8538340941043407,7.792459306144053,3.9201351739255808,4.637773374493822,4.724033718778229,4.933754249760298,5.064116067623542,5.3064295350454715,5.541743621979936,5.9370563586240825,6.137727054086234,6.255510089742618,6.948657270302562,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.227555912568474E-5,6.185562047166302E-5,6.233648893845616E-5,6.197630804127691E-5,6.197732345330663E-5,6.189069154055464E-5,6.207476312888464E-5,6.18645272768342E-5,6.200362128644756E-5,6.87896331729891E-5,0.7498012025227755,6.176466429018774E-5,6.29174711202478E-5,0.09996544067219335,6.180970243906536E-5,6.163888708989931E-5,6.317639202443556E-5,6.208057906562985E-5,6.188797431091702E-5,6.19392684381263E-5,6.253856718837652E-5,6.214208521014763E-5,6.221284340151315E-5,6.227987076254092E-5,6.275783677455315E-5,6.242963095590542E-5,6.50540540424246E-5,6.178302635856324E-5,6.178467919

{"value":"I was expecting a little something from \"K-911\", I mean it did look like a cute movie that I could get into. I always did love the dog comedy movies. But it looked like it was supposed to be Jame's movie, not Jerry Lee's. The plot was pretty lame and the two love interests really didn't have chemistry to begin with. Not to mention that James seemed to have a total sexist view in the movie despite the fact the writer wasn't going in that direction. James just really ticked me off for more than half the film. The dogs were the true stars and that's pretty sad that they out shined the actors.<br /><br />So, I'm glad it's not just me on IMDb who agrees that this was a pretty stupid movie. But hopefully, James will realize it was his brother Jim who was the talented one, no offense, but not everyone can be their star sibling.

{"value":"It was a disappointment to see this DVD after so many years. For me the main problem's the uneven script.<br /><br />While some of it is witty and hip, quite a bit of it is dull, unfunny and lifeless. Many of the gags just sit there, lacking spark and energy.<br /><br />Of the cast, Mae West and Rachel Welch come over well. Roger Herren in the role of Rusty shines (too bad he didn't make more films). But for my money, there's just too much of John Huston, and poor Rex Reed isn't hardly given a fighting chance. His character seems relegated to skim around on the sidelines, wondering what he's doing in this film.<br /><br />The low user rating should give an idea as to the public's opinion of this piece. Vidal's original provided much potential that was pretty much wasted. Not even the 'classic' film clips did much.

{"value":"Recreation of 1950's (London) Soho and the up-and-coming people. Based on a cult novel.<br /><br />Julian Temple is a video director. No more, no less. Give him 15 million dollars and he will make you a 15 million dollar pop video. Here he forgets that two minutes with people that can't really act is one thing - but two hours? What was he thinking of. Besides who are the audience? Who cares about a book that was well remembered way-back-when. The usual London story of the chancer taking his chance. <br /><br />What could really drag this film even further down? Oh I know, third rate songs that sound like they were made up on the spot. David Bowie crones the film title over and over a few times and that is the highlight. The soundtrack album is clay pigeon material.<br /><br />There is one good thing though. Good recreation of period Soho.

{"value":"I saw this movie last month at a free sneak preview and I walked out. It was pretty horrible. In the process of trying too hard, they over acted and made a horrible movie. I was disappointed since I felt all the actors had made respectable choices in the past so this one couldn't be that far off the mark--but, I was wrong. I was hoping they would give out a survey at the end of the movie so I could tell them not to release this movie. I was lured in by the free aspect of the preview, but it turned out to be a waste of my time--and, usually, I'm very easily amused. It tried to be innovative and creative with the shots, ideas and filming, but because they threw together so many ideas at once, it failed. I'm not usually picky about movies and I usually don't feel the need to display my opinions about movies, but I had to warn everyone not to watch it.

{"value":"Adrian has just gone out of the asylum, being rich and with no parents, his life seems empty. One day, he meets Gonzalo, a poor boy whom mother is prostitute. Desperate for earning some money, Gonzalo helps Adrian to search about his life and who where his parents. This is a movie from a new director, and it is perfectly clear in most of the film: scenes not correctly directed, dialogues a little forced, some incoherences in the script...Anyway, the ending is unexpectedly well done (well, just a little) and that saves a little the film. Actors are known and with great quality, nevertheless, they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting; all of them have done better papers in other film. The film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends.

{"value":"Whoever wrote the \"nice\" post about this must have been a friend of these guys. This is bad even for backyard wrestling. In fact this isn't even backyard wrestling really, it's a few guys hitting each other on a trampoline. Each guys is about 45 lbs wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this. It is just a few bored kids that even give yard tards a bad name, if that is possible. If you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestling, pick up Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain. It stars the 2 biggest names in BYW, MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition. These guys are good. They have actually went since yarding it and gotten professionally trained as \"real\" pro wrestlers. They went legit and have gotten better. I recommend checking out those 2 guys. MDogg is insane and off the hook.

{"value":"I am appalled at how bad this film is. As a pastiche of early 20th century Hollywood artistes it sets a new low - even past The Moderns or (gasp) Cradle Will Rock & I never thought I'd see a film worse than those 2. Granted they were about a slightly different milieu & period. Nevertheless the intents & results were distressingly similar.<br /><br />First off there's the horrible casting: Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN? Excuse me? Peter, did you owe this guy something? Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons?? Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies??? Holy smoke, these people don't even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly depicting.<br /><br />Well, Last Picture Show was a decent film, but this thing is a disaster & the rest of Bogdonovitch's pics haven't been much better. Guess rubbing up against Welles & Hitch & Ford wore off a long time ago.

{"value":"Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama? This film starts with a light-hearted banter between three women. Fine. It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man. Fine. There are a few antics between them. Fine.

It's hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing. Truly a lesson (for British filmmakers anyway) of how not to make films. Difficult to see how the producers ever convinced themselves this film would work. And the box office proved it to be a real flop, because I'd never heard of this film until this weekend (four years after its release).","finished_norm":["be","thi","mean","to","be","a","comedi","or","a","seriou","drama","thi","film","start","with","a","lightheart","banter","between","three","woman","fine","it","move","into","a","conflict","between","the","woman","when","on","of","them","meet","a","man","fine","there","be","a","few","antic","between","them","fine","but","when","the","plot","thicken","and","final","becom","black","i","start","to","wonder","whether","i","have","misinterpret","the","part","of","the","movi","it","continu","in","thi","vein","for","a","while","until","in","the","end","it","try","to","go","back","to","the","origin","lightheart","banter","but","by","now","it","too","late","it","hard","to","see","why","thi","woman","would","still","be","talk","to","on","anoth","and","the","final","be","unconvinc","truli","a","lesson","for","british","filmmak","anywai","of","how","not","to","make","film","difficult","to","see","how","the","produc","ever","convinc","themselv","thi","film","would","work","and","the","box","offic","prove","it","to","be","a","real","flop","becaus","i","have","never","hear","of","thi","film","until","thi","weekend","four","year","after","it","releas"],"filtered":["thi","mean","comedi","seriou","drama","thi","film","start","lightheart","banter","three","woman","fine","move","conflict","woman","meet","man","fine","antic","fine","plot","thicken","final","becom","black","start","wonder","whether","misinterpret","part","movi","continu","thi","vein","end","try","go","back","origin","lightheart","banter","late","hard","see","thi","woman","still","talk","anoth","final","unconvinc","truli","lesson","british","filmmak","anywai","make","film","difficult","see","produc","ever","convinc","themselv","thi","film","work","box","offic","prove","real","flop","becaus","never","hear","thi","film","thi","weekend","four","year","releas"],"filtered2":["mean","comedi","seriou","drama","start","lightheart","banter","three","woman","fine","move","conflict","woman","meet","man","fine","antic","fine","plot","thicken","final","becom","black","start","wonder","whether","misinterpret","part","continu","vein","end","try","go","back","origin","lightheart","banter","late","hard","see","woman","still","talk","anoth","final","unconvinc","truli","lesson","british","filmmak","anywai","make","difficult","see","produc","ever","convinc","themselv","work","box","offic","prove","real","flop","becaus","never","hear","weekend","four","year","releas"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,22,24,32,36,42,44,45,48,57,61,63,64,69,70,71,73,80,88,115,127,150,156,171,175,186,216,224,229,261,275,323,327,343,350,386,433,436,463,464,478,493,540,587,597,606,654,696,803,1272,1331,1398,1565,1952,3421,3649,4538,5383],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,22,24,32,36,42,44,45,48,57,61,63,64,69,70,71,73,80,88,115,127,150,156,171,175,186,216,224,229,261,275,323,327,343,350,386,433,436,463,464,478,493,540,587,597,606,654,696,803,1272,1331,1398,1565,1952,3421,3649,4538,5383],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,0.9708269144703846,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,1.6955116224012472,1.834162586674748,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,1.883428577602134,2.127032521151058,6.2840273587550515,3.8429853485101932,1.8950689206770979,1.9951803900462557,2.0317223413467334,2.201553588425805,2.4359679371086367,2.332712011146513,4.690310282830337,2.373087554090762,2.3791142619576227,2.571852579609833,2.6070186965339692,2.689504733779216,2.8432628718938773,2.7085302779237206,2.7832848715031413,3.0433232530252132,2.9674191958529437,2.9705344631698933,3.0135689919434205,3.0433232530252132,3.164467636384302,3.2070272508030975,3.3467891931782563,9.861703987264997,3.3243163373261977,3.342254038012865,3.432149042129413,3.6105180246075443,3.4986697244709752,3.584239140143704,3.634471265630037,3.8095464139032247,3.7636829971100436,4.416284083275639,4.513582994262438,4.436351646326448,4.671389985292807,4.85885294158718,5.583416318380505,5.672363804397,11.999153431210834,12.596139408322827]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.188430289190979E-5,6.146700257014065E-5,6.194484990331572E-5,6.158693190065377E-5,6.158794093319383E-5,6.150185329939145E-5,6.168476842831096E-5,6.147585341687332E-5,6.161407354596105E-5,6.83574512194926E-5,0.8977249267430994,6.137661783552995E-5,6.252218197094493E-5,6.341407463513641E-5,6.142137302498089E-5,6.125163085076701E-5,6.27794761628359E-5,6.169054782549653E-5,0.027996438783422336,6.155012500477764E-5,6.214565856407298E-5,6.175166754775176E-5,6.182198118937979E-5,6.188858744021274E-5,6.23635505537467E-5,6.203740674103372E-5,6.464534146667619E-5,6.13948645412524

{"value":"I saw this cinematic wretchedness in a dollar theater with a friend in 1979 (back when the tickets actually sold for $1). This is the only film I have ever walked out on (with my friend, while the idiocy that is the \"Laser Bra 2000\" sketch was on screen). Evidently, my and my friend's reaction to the film was a common one. It is not that I found the film offensive (either as an 18-year-old or now), but rather that it is mind-numbingly stupid and patently unfunny, devoid even of the unintended humor that makes a Ed Wood film watchable. This is the real reason why NBC refused to air it, rather than a failure to comprehend Mr. Mike's \"vision\" (unless, of course, his vision was to drive the film's backers into bankruptcy).<br /><br />I remained surprised to this day that this film does not seem to have made any published \"10 worst films of all time\" list. It certainly makes mine.

{"value":"This movie . . . I don't know. Why they would take such an indellible character as Pippi Longstocking and cast the singularly charmless Tami Erin, I will never know. Why they would spend money on art direction and some not-all-that-bad special effects, then not bother to edit it properly, I will never know. Why the sets and costumes are sometimes in period, and sometimes bizarrely not, why they commissioned SUCH bad songs, why the script doesn't make any sense whatsoever (not even on a silly, children's film level) . . . . what were they thinking?? Nothing about this movie is quite as it should be. Every single part is dubbed (and always poorly,) every sound effect is slightly wrong, every edit is in the wrong place, every performance is bad in some way. It does manage to create an appropriate atmosphere, despite all the problems, but it NEVER captures the magic that is Astrid Lindgren's

{"value":"The King Maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina.<br /><br />Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still fails to impress the viewer. The acting, in particular, was extremely poor. Some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents, both real and fake, are extremely irritating. The storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson. The movie couldn't even capture that sort of regal and century-old air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth.<br /><br />Final say? Costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the execution was extremely poor and the actors couldn't even give natural bursts of emotion. In short, the movie sounded more like hullabaloo than a

{"value":"This is your typical Priyadarshan movie--a bunch of loony characters out on some silly mission. His signature climax has the entire cast of the film coming together and fighting each other in some crazy moshpit over hidden money. Whether it is a winning lottery ticket in Malamaal Weekly, black money in Hera Pheri, \"kodokoo\" in Phir Hera Pheri, etc., etc., the director is becoming ridiculously predictable. Don't get me wrong; as clichéd and preposterous his movies may be, I usually end up enjoying the comedy. However, in most his previous movies there has actually been some good humor, (Hungama and Hera Pheri being noteworthy ones). Now, the hilarity of his films is fading as he is using the same formula over and over again.<br /><br />Songs are good. Tanushree Datta looks awesome. Rajpal Yadav is irritating, and Tusshar is not a whole lot better.

{"value":"On his birthday a small boys tells his mother he is not her son, and that he wants to go home to his real mother.<br /><br />In some ways Comedy De L'Innocence feels like it comes from a different time of movie-making, perhaps the 60's or 70's. Certainly it reminded me of Losey's Secret Ceremony (1968), and Richard Loncraine's Full Circle (1977), both of which deal with loss, grief and relationships between parents and 'lost' children (curiously both films star Mia Farrow).<br /><br />All three films are populated with unsympathetic characters who behave in strange and unexplained ways. All three films have a chilly feel, both emotionally and literally. All three films focus on mother-child relationships, and ultimately all three films pose the question - 'what is real, what is imagined?' <br /><br />Beautiful but flawed, it offers no easy answers

{"value":"Okay like most Steven Seagal fans I know I not going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but I do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget. The main problem with the copy I watched was the terrible over dubbing I know that in some films this has to be done and I accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away. Also the sets seem to be built with no care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it. I was truly disappointed with this film and only hope Stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying/renting. The story of this film had me wondering if I was watching a sci-fi film or not some parts seemed alien like but they never fully explained what was going on I found it very

{"value":"It started out with an interesting premise. I always like Civil War stuff and ancient secret societies. The more the film progressed, the more I realized that this was a B movie at best. In the latter half, it quickly became a C movie, then D, then F, then \"I wish that this wasn't a rental so that I could put it in the microwave!\" I can't say that the acting in all cases was awful, just most. The writing, however... I never read the book. Maybe the book is well written. The screenplay was written by a 10 year old. It was ridiculously shallow, the dialog drab and uninteresting, the characters about as interesting as a 5 pound bag of fertilizer. I really hated this movie, as did my wife. I am a Christian and I have no problem with movies that promote or support Christianity. This movie did a great disservice to the cause. Awful, terrible, worthless.

{"value":"This movie wastes virtually every actor's talents in what could best be charitably called a \"potboiler\".<br /><br />Despite it's action-packed 'Top Gun' opening it is all downhill from there with plenty of stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to choke yourself on your popcorn.<br /><br />There are so many dead-end story lines in this movie I was guessing at one point it was made by splicing together a discarded TV series.<br /><br />Quinn's Mexican drug-lord role is laughable and his 'associates' plucked right out of a 1970's Quinn-Martin cop show. Costner's character is wooden and gives us no reason to believe he actually fell in love with Mendez' wife. Nor are we convincingly led to believe the wife is aching for companionship and will jump the first hot body coming along.<br /><br />Definitely a 'B' movie at best and a huge waste of time for

{"value":"Here's an interesting little movie that strictly gives the phrase \"low budget\" a horrible name. Our physics teacher who has about nine kids creates a strange serum that causes \"molecular reorganization\". Students are hopelessly killed from fake coincidences of submarine sandwiches and flying school supplies. Sounds like a resurrection of classic B-movies from the 50s, right? Nope! It's not an example of high camp fun, which is way, WAY off the mark. A glamorous showcase of breasts and butts ensues our desire for pleasure, opposing the horror that should have had 99.44% more in the first place. Bottom-of-the-barrel entertainment at its best, aided by pints of red blood and dead student bodies. Atrocious movies like this would make the ultimately catastrophic GURU THE MAD MONK (1970) the work of an intelligent genius who has a Master's degree in film production!

{"value":"This movie is a bad to alright rip off of Friday the 13th. The movie is about a killer named Bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp. He kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father, and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother (Another F13th take off). The intro is seeing Bernie killing his first victims. Then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods, soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son. Later we learn that his son is Bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute.

{"value":"I felt Rancid Aluminium was a complete waste of two hours, the plot line was thin and confusing, the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents. The camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey, it just made it even more difficult to watch. One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience. The best performances weren't anything to do with acting. In fact probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people, although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary.

{"value":"This movie is weak ,The box-cover says East LA's toughest gang and it is really Santa Ana's , James Cahill acts like a closet queen taking down all the tough guys in the tough Chlo gang . It is fake , boring , senseless and whack , I tried to get my money back from the video store this movie was so bad . It was also on the homo-erotic tip far from what the video-box proclaims . James Cahill should act in Gay Porno .James is in every scene , he cannot act to save his life . The film features Eva Longoria who is hot but James can't even score with her !!!!!!!!! I felt at times I was watching Gay Porn and was turned - off by the whole film . James clearly want's to be with men but rather then submit to his gay desires he beats up gang members over and over and over again .

{"value":"Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film. First of all, it was made. Second of all, people went to see it. Third, some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen. If a monkey could make a movie, i'm 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good. Most crappy movies have their moments, (even Godzilla had a few cool special effects) this film's moment was when I left the theater nauseated. The only thing that possibly could've made this movie any worse would be if Jerry Springer was the star. If I want to stare at crap for an hour and a half, i'll take a dump in a can. If anyone didn't utterly despise this movie, I pity you, and your children, and your children's children's children; however, contrary to Springer's beliefs, I clearly don't condone children having

{"value":"I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to ruin one of the best shows that was on TV. Did we really need a big screen re-make? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears, and Kiefer Southerland, took out all the music, and made it a drama. Do you think they would like that! This movie does not have the same feel to it that the original had. Sure the original was a bit corny at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people that passed through town. None of that mattered to the people that made this film, they might have never even seen the original show all the way through.

{"value":"Another too bad the lowest they can go here is one. Otherwise this would get an easy zero. Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. In fact were Peckenpah's name not on the thing I would never have guessed he did it. Actually one of the people in San Francisco I know was on the set a lot and from nearly sunup on he says that Sam was just plain snockered. It shows in spades. The laughing bit at the early part of the film is the ONLY thing in this entire mess worth a second look. Not even Gig Young is watchable. This is a true test of masochism. Had I been forced into the confines of a theatre to see it I would have jumped up screaming. And now I truly feel guilty having watched it all from the confines of a very comfortable couch that was just too nice to leave. What a mess, it seemed less written than made up as they went along.

{"value":"Leave it to Paul \"sex on the brain\" Verhoeven to come up with a pointlessly sleazy and juvenile version of the INVISIBLE MAN story. If he'd direct a Pokemon film, I'm sure he'd turn it into some massive orgy of sorts. I don't mind sex or even sleaze (check my other reviews) on film but frankly, it's obvious the director has a one track mind and he couldn't see interesting aspects about an invisible man storyline than the kinky implications it comes with it. It's a shame because it could have been good if the film didn't spend so much time having an invisible Kevin Bacon grope women. <br /><br />The game cast of actors does what it can with the one-note cheesy script but I felt bad for some of them, including William Devane, who is totally wasted here.<br /><br />But then what could I have expected from the director of SHOWGIRLS, which, btw, is much

{"value":"I feel it is my duty as a lover of horror films to warm other people about this horrible and very very bad \"horror\" film. Don't waste your time or money on this film, the acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst i have come across and the script was just awful. Nothing about it was good, you end up thinking to yourself why am i watching this crap. The plot had so many holes in it and they never got cleared up in the end, it was just so bad, i don't know how a film so terrible could be made. As i said before i love horror films and i was so let down, it was an 18 but you see little blood and no scares or jumps at all. Also what annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the film that had no point to the plot at all like the brother and sister kissing, why? is all i can say.

{"value":"This title seems more like a filming exercise than a film that should have been released to be seen by the public. For Dafoe and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time, without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it. I felt like it was 90mins wasted as I waited anxiously for a plot to develop, or even begin.<br /><br />Try to fit this film into a genre and you won't, because it lacks a beginning, middle or ending. I've seen 'arty' movies before and this doesn't even come close to being arty, abstract or original, it just seems to me to be completely pointless.<br /><br />I think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a 10 were the under 18 age group. No doubt for the constant pointless erotic scenes that the film was insistent on throwing at us. That is if you can call it erotic.

{"value":"Absolutely the most boring movie I have ever spent my money on.This was a wrong choice for all these great stars to waste their reputations on. Boring! boring! boring! Each character was portrayed in a less than inspirational way. No acting talent shown -just reading a part. Alec can play realistic characters normally, Gwynyth made herself look ugly for an unrewarding part, Annette needs advise on how to pick the movies she chooses to play in as do all these big stars who have left me disappointed at the way they have all allowed their talents to be smothered in a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment. \"Running with scissors\" leads the public to anticipate great acting in a film that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion. There was not one moment when the cast was able to portray any interpretation of this onto the screen.

{"value":"Acclaimed Japanese director Takashi Miike can't seem to get the wheels moving with this torpid thriller, an adaptation of Yasushi Akimoto's book concerning an evil old woman (and child abuser!) who is part of a new urban legend: if your cell-phone rings with a strange tone--and you see the message 'One Missed Call'--you will replay the message only to hear your own final words before your death. Most successful part of the film is the trenchant satire of Reality TV cameras intruding on the future victims, but the not-so-elaborate deaths (which include a hidden piece of red candy!) are disappointing and dispiriting. The frequent shots of ravaged dead bodies are actually displayed rather discreetly, and this overall politeness may be the reason why the film is ultimately so staid. Hollywood predictably jumped on the far-fetched plot in 2008, yet the U.S. version fared no better.

{"value":"Muscular man-ape in the jungles of Africa is hunted by an opportunistic expedition team; the comely daughter of the team's leader finds him first. Much-ballyhooed version of the Tarzan tale has an OK production, but is crippled by the single-handedly worst direction of a film I have ever seen. John Derek is bereft of inspiration beyond cheesy slow-motion action shots and peek-a-boo glimpses of wife Bo Derek's unclothed body; he has about as much talent behind the camera as Ed Wood. Trying for tongue-in-cheek sexuality, the Dereks lack finesse, snappy timing, and taste. They have a sense of self-parody and bravura abandonment (they do throw caution to the winds), but after a promising opening it all goes to hell. Miles O'Keeffe (who possibly had marbles in his mouth the entire time) has the title role, but plays third fiddle to John Derek's ego and Bo Derek's sense of self-importance. * from

{"value":"with all the European studios involved in this one, you would think you'd at least get some pretty photography; but the local color is kept to a minimum.<br /><br />Irritation #1 is Mira Sorvino using a Russian accent in order to play a Spanish cop - WTF? The story is hopelessly confused. There's a supposed romantic back story that is intentionally confused - is she or isn't she a lesbian? - serving no purpose whatsoever. The cops in the movie are the most stupid to have graced a serial killer film in a long time. There seems to be some message about the mid-'30s Spanish Civil War But since pretty much everybody involved in that is dead, one doesn't see the point in it.<br /><br />Despite the bull-fighting backdrop of part of the narrative (which part? who can tell), you never even get a good look at a bull fight.

{"value":"The problems with this film are many, but I will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones. First of all, while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Manhattan life, the reality was that everything, as usual in movies and TV, was about something bizarre, usually of a sexual nature. The story lines were thin or nonexistent, and virtually every scene, camera shot, line of dialog, and expressed emotion was absolutely, and totally fake. It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that I walked out (something no uncommon for me in recent years.) I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur drop outs from some 3rd rate film studies program, but I believe the (at one time, pre-Amelia, talented)director Mira Nair took part in this disgusting travesty, so perhaps the directorial talent in America has descended en masse into the
