{"value":"Oh dear. good cast, but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task. Even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right. Im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times. The main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue, that made some people in the film annoying. It may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task. And the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film. Overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me, but I'm sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good.

{"value":"This was a better than average movie I thought, for it being on cable. I had expected something along the lines of cheesy melodrama and bad special effects seen in such classics as Christmas Rush or First Daughter/Target/Shot, etc.<br /><br />The cast was well chosen...I especially liked Ron Livingston as the hard pressed SWAT Commander. It's good to see him revisiting the same material he had so much fortune with in Band of Brothers. The producers and designers had done their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they did on that day back in 1997.<br /><br />So, if you get a chance to see this film, and I am sure you will since FX reruns everything 50 times...take 2 hours and enjoy it.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","well","than","averag","movi","i","think","for","it","be","on","cabl","i","have","expect","someth","along","the","line","of","cheesi","melodrama","and","bad","special","effect","see","in","such","classic","a","christma","rush","or","daughtertargetshot","etcbr","br","the","cast","be","good","choseni","especi","like","ron","livingston","a","the","hard","press","swat","command","it","good","to","see","him","revisit","the","same","materi","he","have","so","much","fortun","with","in","band","of","brother","the","produc","and","design","have","do","their","homework","becaus","all","the","scene","and","shot","look","like","thei","do","on","that","dai","back","in","br","br","so","if","you","get","a","chanc","to","see","thi","film","and","i","be","sure","you","will","sinc","fx","rerun","everyth","timestak","hour","and","enjoi","it"],"filtered":["thi","well","averag","movi","think","cabl","expect","someth","along","line","cheesi","melodrama","bad","special","effect","see","classic","christma","rush","daughtertargetshot","etcbr","br","cast","good","choseni","especi","like","ron","livingston","hard","press","swat","command","good","see","revisit","materi","much","fortun","band","brother","produc","design","homework","becaus","scene","shot","look","like","thei","dai","back","br","br","get","chanc","see","thi","film","sure","sinc","fx","rerun","everyth","timestak","hour","enjoi"],"filtered2":["well","averag","think","cabl","expect","someth","along","line","cheesi","melodrama","bad","special","effect","see","classic","christma","rush","daughtertargetshot","etcbr","cast","good","choseni","especi","like","ron","livingston","hard","press","swat","command","good","see","revisit","materi","fortun","band","brother","produc","design","homework","becaus","scene","shot","look","like","dai","back","get","chanc","see","sure","sinc","fx","rerun","everyth","timestak","hour","enjoi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,9,12,16,19,20,22,53,63,92,106,107,119,130,132,162,171,174,193,200,203,261,267,324,332,381,441,486,537,543,643,681,748,927,1364,1465,1533,1772,1857,1964,2148,2596,3167,3436,4928,5123,6739,7368],"values":[2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,9,12,16,19,20,22,53,63,92,106,107,119,130,132,162,171,174,193,200,203,261,267,324,332,381,441,486,537,543,643,681,748,927,1364,1465,1533,1772,1857,1964,2148,2596,3167,3436,4928,5123,6739,7368],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.967100616408184,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.7003182735607676,1.8729627573220065,2.0489535369135887,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955,2.1653408989309972,2.2642139034199635,2.253494045787767,2.3586007221245198,2.373087554090762,2.456282578459816,2.517840471459249,2.5308211829319704,2.569760528637609,2.7085302779237206,2.7085302779237206,2.8753661172782943,2.9705344631698933,3.24941502915308,3.293679367864308,3.3066947359763783,3.424750734647968,3.477726550625732,3.5813614403160887,3.706716172503366,4.246178114249808,4.251780369798478,4.436351646326448,4.506310234933358,4.558366596889411,4.8184434032493035,5.051537285416681,4.900964426937307,5.170884043049248,5.2288713006995975,5.463272006538442,5.626901430320244,6.101359409915359,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805368E-4,2.1925531043720612E-4,2.1930944626706047E-4,2.1926535805328205E-4,2.1928610891855613E-4,2.192541015295698E-4,2.1932229259911864E-4,2.1922148009526662E-4,2.1925535677457455E-4,2.1948193342720797E-4,2.2122345868647722E-4,2.1925571892772607E-4,2.194633679490942E-4,2.1948623224568874E-4,2.193865253813078E-4,2.1926622170779204E-4,2.1934165776813408E-4,2.1944488069798194E-4,2.1927754147741074E-4,2.1927673977696312E-4,2.1947401253786476E-4,2.192987090676412E-4,2.1929904095723235E-4,2.1943952627086753E-4,2.192776205763414E-4,2.1948885564790872E-4,2.193324939519084E-4,2.192548190405609E-4,2.1935421980567524E-4,2.1942116987548033E-4,2.192997847633019E-4,2.194172369524271E-4,2.1952496533805891E-4,2.1972871854514234E-4,2.1933211493919256E-4,2.192660887193527E-4,2.19345146527165E-4,2.1928835723826457E-4,2.1922171407356026E-4,2.192774735707245E-4,2.1949722707154424E-4,2.19376819025782E-4,2.194177369665054E-4,2.1923262471379985E-4,2.1927752932743112E-4,2.1926600626693155E-4,2.1934022582203967E-4,2.1937825969134975E-4,2.19333650361901E-4,2.1929888559081104E-4,2.1926654849491648E-4,2.1971579004444698E-4,2.1932172227464707E-4,2.192774790692998E-4,2.1932054772559216E-4,2.1925504336804666E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630285E-4,2.1926685631708633E-4,2.192549182116765E-4,2.194303274057624E-4,2.1934224257171364E-4,2.192548265573637E-4,2.1923253539347

{"value":"This movie is just another average action flick, but it could have been so much better. When the guns come out they really needed some choreography help. Someone like Andy McNabb - who made that brilliant action sequence in Heat as they move up the street from the robbery - would have turned the dull action sequences into something special. Because the rest of the film was alright - predictable but watchable - better than you would expect from this type of movie. Then came the final scene, the show-down, the one we had been waiting for, but was like watching something from the A-Team in the 80s. They shoot wildly, nothing hits, and they run around a house trying to kill each other - same old, same old.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","just","anoth","averag","action","flick","but","it","can","have","be","so","much","well","when","the","gun","come","out","thei","realli","ne","some","choreographi","help","someon","like","andi","mcnabb","who","make","that","brilliant","action","sequenc","in","heat","a","thei","move","up","the","street","from","the","robberi","would","have","turn","the","dull","action","sequenc","into","someth","special","becaus","the","rest","of","the","film","be","alright","predict","but","watchabl","well","than","you","would","expect","from","thi","typ","of","movi","then","come","the","final","scene","the","showdown","the","on","we","have","be","wait","for","but","be","like","watch","someth","from","the","ateam","in","the","thei","shoot","wildli","noth","hit","and","thei","run","around","a","hous","try","to","kill","each","other","same","old","same","old"],"filtered":["thi","movi","anoth","averag","action","flick","much","well","gun","come","thei","realli","ne","choreographi","help","someon","like","andi","mcnabb","make","brilliant","action","sequenc","heat","thei","move","street","robberi","turn","dull","action","sequenc","someth","special","becaus","rest","film","alright","predict","watchabl","well","expect","thi","typ","movi","come","final","scene","showdown","wait","like","watch","someth","ateam","thei","shoot","wildli","noth","hit","thei","run","around","hous","try","kill","old","old"],"filtered2":["anoth","averag","action","flick","well","gun","come","realli","ne","choreographi","help","someon","like","andi","mcnabb","make","brilliant","action","sequenc","heat","move","street","robberi","turn","dull","action","sequenc","someth","special","becaus","rest","alright","predict","watchabl","well","expect","typ","come","final","scene","showdown","wait","like","watch","someth","ateam","shoot","wildli","noth","hit","run","around","hous","try","kill","old","old"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,13,19,20,22,34,36,49,53,67,73,76,96,98,110,117,129,130,137,139,156,185,203,213,226,257,275,331,337,349,367,384,388,501,643,664,912,1178,1551,1647,2884,3037,3420,4153,4472],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,13,19,20,22,34,36,49,53,67,73,76,96,98,110,117,129,130,137,139,156,185,203,213,226,257,275,331,337,349,367,384,388,501,643,664,912,1178,1551,1647,2884,3037,3420,4153,4472],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.312380678011735,2.330690080046114,1.2979240167361772,2.7965700178917925,1.4680183469605717,1.6920303308087352,3.400636547121535,3.9141830778533158,1.8950689206770979,2.1337665533324026,2.0390708128715254,2.0881990796736947,2.1290479736304078,2.2797301185117202,7.232087502023765,2.2642139034199635,2.2939035841256437,2.2939035841256437,2.3451551414151686,2.518833027372001,2.569760528637609,2.8432628718938773,2.5940874818617203,2.7602659523229094,2.7832848715031413,2.932274249550174,2.973659465713028,6.113673944383873,3.0791938792932125,3.109204957709252,3.0914425013694116,3.5119855004467477,3.5813614403160887,3.6905607322810807,3.9405024767500145,4.229557233013768,4.573751515728891,4.933754249760298,5.426230734858092,5.672363804397,5.7959777603641776,5.850044981634453,5.999576715605417]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805366E-4,2.192553104372061E-4,2.1930944626706044E-4,2.19265358053282E-4,2.192861089185561E-4,2.1925410152956977E-4,2.193222925991186E-4,2.192214800952666E-4,2.1925535677457452E-4,2.1948193342720795E-4,2.212234586864772E-4,2.1925571892772604E-4,2.1946336794909416E-4,2.194862322456887E-4,2.1938652538130778E-4,2.1926622170779202E-4,2.1934165776813405E-4,2.1944488069798192E-4,2.1927754147741071E-4,2.1927673977696307E-4,2.1947401253786473E-4,2.1929870906764118E-4,2.1929904095723232E-4,2.194395262708675E-4,2.1927762057634138E-4,2.194888556479087E-4,2.1933249395190838E-4,2.1925481904056088E-4,2.193542198056752E-4,2.194211698754803E-4,2.1929978476330187E-4,2.1941723695242707E-4,2.195249653380589E-4,2.197287185451423E-4,2.1933211493919253E-4,2.1926608871935266E-4,2.1934514652716496E-4,2.1928835723826454E-4,2.1922171407356023E-4,2.1927747357072447E-4,2.1949722707154421E-4,2.1937681902578198E-4,2.1941773696650536E-4,2.1923262471379982E-4,2.192775293274311E-4,2.1926600626693152E-4,2.1934022582203964E-4,2.1937825969134972E-4,2.1933365036190097E-4,2.19298885590811E-4,2.1926654849491645E-4,2.1971579004444696E-4,2.1932172227464704E-4,2.1927747906929978E-4,2.1932054772559213E-4,2.1925504336804664E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630282E-4,2.192668563170863E-4,2.1925491821167648E-4,2.1943032740576236E-4,2.193422425717136E-4,2.1925482655736368E-4,2.192325353934711E-4,2.1921048914035583E-4,2.1940869012321306E-4,2.1926556769286498E-4,2.193652376645658E-4,2.194296158006731E-4,2.19330064853975E

{"value":"I caught this on Showtime tonight and was amazed by how a movie with such a interesting premise could wind up being so unbelievably awful. WHO'S YOUR DADDY? stars Brandon Davis as an adopted high school senior Chris Hughes, a geek who inherits the heir to a porn empire left to him by his biological parents. Though the premise sounds like the movie could be a lot of fun, it is ruined by inept directing from first-time director Andy Fickman, a clichéd and predictable screenplay, and acting that is even bad by direct-to-video standards. Even the normally funny Charlie Talbert turns in a surprisingly dismal performance as the best friend.

{"value":"This is one of the worst films I've seen in years!! You could randomly pluck 5 people off the streets and they could act better than anyone in this film. Absolute waste of time watching it. I only gave it a 2 as I like gory films but this is just plain rubbish. The acting (and I use that term VERY loosely) is abysmal, someone please tell me that the 5 main actors in this were making their first ever film?? Don't waste your time watching this. Hostel was a better film by some way. I cannot believe that someone has spent money making this, I hope for the producers sake it only cost $50,000 to make - it looks like a school project, made by kids who haven't got a clue.

{"value":"If you enjoy the original SNL cast and shows then avoid this movie at all costs. When this first came out my friends and I waited in line for over an hour to get in to a sold out movie house. half way through the movie the theatre was 3/4 empty. We refused to leave thinking it would get better. When the movie ended we were the only ones left in the theatre. The movie lasted only one day in all theaters then vanished from sight. In interviews with \"Mr. Mike\" he refused to comment on this film. The film was an inside joke on the episodes of SNL that came out right after the films release and closing in one day. We all tried to contact \"Mr. Mike\" by phone and mail to get a refund but were totally ignored.","finished_norm":["if","you","enjoi","the","origin","snl","cast","and","show","then","avoid","thi","movi","at","all","cost","when","thi","come","out","my","friend","and","i","wait","in","line","for","over","a","hour","to","get","in","to","a","sell","out","movi","hous","half","wai","through","the","movi","the","theatr","be","empti","we","refus","to","leav","think","it","would","get","well","when","the","movi","end","we","be","the","onli","on","leav","in","the","theatr","the","movi","last","onli","on","dai","in","all","theater","then","vanish","from","sight","in","interview","with","mr","mike","he","refus","to","comment","on","thi","film","the","film","be","a","insid","joke","on","the","episod","of","snl","that","come","out","right","after","the","film","releas","and","close","in","on","dai","we","all","try","to","contact","mr","mike","by","phone","and","mail","to","get","a","refund","but","be","total","ignor"],"filtered":["enjoi","origin","snl","cast","show","avoid","thi","movi","cost","thi","come","friend","wait","line","hour","get","sell","movi","hous","half","wai","movi","theatr","empti","refus","leav","think","get","well","movi","end","onli","leav","theatr","movi","last","onli","dai","theater","vanish","sight","interview","mr","mike","refus","comment","thi","film","film","insid","joke","episod","snl","come","right","film","releas","close","dai","try","contact","mr","mike","phone","mail","get","refund","total","ignor"],"filtered2":["enjoi","origin","snl","cast","show","avoid","cost","come","friend","wait","line","hour","get","sell","hous","half","wai","theatr","empti","refus","leav","think","get","well","end","onli","leav","theatr","last","onli","dai","theater","vanish","sight","interview","mr","mike","refus","comment","insid","joke","snl","come","right","releas","close","dai","try","contact","mr","mike","phone","mail","get","refund","total","ignor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,11,12,20,24,28,33,34,36,69,74,92,107,121,132,144,161,174,184,200,206,213,214,280,295,327,331,335,357,424,762,836,861,890,983,1091,1118,1144,1280,1327,1545,2086,2673,3133,3824,4929],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,11,12,20,24,28,33,34,36,69,74,92,107,121,132,144,161,174,184,200,206,213,214,280,295,327,331,335,357,424,762,836,861,890,983,1091,1118,1144,1280,1327,1545,2086,2673,3133,3824,4929],"values":[2.389902141215977,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,2.7965700178917925,1.4680183469605717,2.127032521151058,3.8972672736018033,2.0489535369135887,2.1439533986393955,2.2190595059394194,4.506988091575534,2.2931108769894046,2.4323182980210873,2.456282578459816,2.496249838866882,2.5308211829319704,2.597304642813496,2.8432628718938773,2.7303758068497004,2.8028805344481915,2.7910771187233068,2.9674191958529437,2.932274249550174,2.908534262247101,6.565922303288567,3.212973749990824,3.7465885637507435,3.7881170224473255,3.892300374932137,3.9161110236258554,4.165705761027235,4.364659717870332,8.69193516971636,4.229557233013768,4.364659717870332,9.226564708971052,9.163067312341893,4.9676558014359795,11.043081829324834,5.521540914662417,5.9370563586240825,6.137727054086234]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612992E-4,2.1169300653874445E-4,2.1174527517734884E-4,2.1170270760391554E-4,2.1172274275403066E-4,2.1169183932737043E-4,2.117576784283851E-4,2.1166034303434346E-4,2.1169305127789726E-4,2.1191181310725412E-4,2.1359327166514599E-4,2.1169340094007565E-4,2.1189388796841988E-4,2.1191596365579475E-4,2.1181969576676956E-4,2.1170354147024E-4,2.1177637567609527E-4,2.118760383584707E-4,2.1171447081128595E-4,2.1171369676217507E-4,2.1190416541618483E-4,2.1173490831315596E-4,2.1173522875559016E-4,2.118708686101445E-4,2.117145471820266E-4,2.1191849657461984E-4,2.117675279277588E-4,2.116925320907914E-4,2.117885044381765E-4,2.118531453425941E-4,2.1173594690714978E-4,2.1184934806943356E-4,2.119533608105548E-4,2.1215008639459377E-4,2.1176716198751693E-4,2.117034130686861E-4,2.1177974410483192E-4,2.117249135272621E-4,2.1166056894252486E-4,2.1171440524675962E-4,2.119265792606669E-4,2.1181032419177924E-4,2.11849830837597E-4,2.1167110326541526E-4,2.1171445908036958E-4,2.1170333346011975E-4,2.1177499311905105E-4,2.118117151675547E-4,2.117686444521779E-4,2.117350787478901E-4,2.1170385698619594E-4,2.1213760380898715E-4,2.1175712777489423E-4,2.1171441055568437E-4,2.117559937370446E-4,2.1169274868102959E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502664E-4,2.1170415419131486E-4,2.1169262784141008E-4,2.1186198702179452E-4,2.1177694030929728E-4,2.1169253934833323E-4,2.1167101702582135E-4,2.1164973116690386E-4,2.1184109602769702E-4,2.1170291001284928E-4,2.117991422816546E-4,2.1186129996057576E-4,2.1176518261149864E-4,2.117146909644077E-4,2.1167129451241

{"value":"Something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot. The movie, that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema, fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making. The best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning, that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistake.<br /><br />The editing is poor. Direction is crap. Acting is out of this world(omg)!

{"value":"I entered the theatre intending to pass a pleasant 90 minutes being entertained if not enlightened. I left neither entertained nor enlightened. This movie can't make up its mind what it wants to be and ends up being not much of anything. There are a few funny lines and a few incredibly pretentious movie references (The 400 Blows--for this character? come off it!). While none of the characters gets treated with much respect, the over thirty gay men get the worst of it: all predatory, fat, sad, slobs. If you're in the mood for a movie dealing with gay relationships check out Parting Glances, Longtime Companion, Trick, All Over the Guy, Red Dirt, Maurice, Philadelphia instead.

{"value":"Something I really love about this woman's short films was the elusiveness of theme -- especially in \"Living with Happiness.\" This film has some nice beginnings -- unusual location and the potential for a strange cinematic treatment, but fails to succeed with clunky expositional dialogue, patchy performances and very television coverage.<br /><br />It's once again charming television and very ordinary cinema. The ideas are so fleshed out that they almost feel pat like a television commercial. But the sentiment is good so we can't complain too much.<br /><br />I really would love to see this director make a full length animation and try and work with a producer who doesn't demand so much boring clarity.","finished_norm":["someth","i","realli","love","about","thi","woman","short","film","be","the","elus","of","theme","especi","in","live","with","happi","thi","film","have","some","nice","begin","unusu","locat","and","the","potenti","for","a","strang","cinemat","treatment","but","fail","to","succ","with","clunki","exposit","dialogu","patchi","perform","and","veri","televis","coveragebr","br","it","onc","again","charm","televis","and","veri","ordinari","cinema","the","idea","be","so","flesh","out","that","thei","almost","feel","pat","like","a","televis","commerci","but","the","sentim","be","good","so","we","ca","not","complain","too","muchbr","br","i","realli","would","love","to","see","thi","director","make","a","full","length","anim","and","try","and","work","with","a","produc","who","doe","not","demand","so","much","bore","clariti"],"filtered":["someth","realli","love","thi","woman","short","film","elus","theme","especi","live","happi","thi","film","nice","begin","unusu","locat","potenti","strang","cinemat","treatment","fail","succ","clunki","exposit","dialogu","patchi","perform","veri","televis","coveragebr","br","onc","charm","televis","veri","ordinari","cinema","idea","flesh","thei","almost","feel","pat","like","televis","commerci","sentim","good","ca","complain","muchbr","br","realli","love","see","thi","director","make","full","length","anim","try","work","produc","doe","demand","much","bore","clariti"],"filtered2":["someth","realli","love","woman","short","elus","theme","especi","live","happi","nice","begin","unusu","locat","potenti","strang","cinemat","treatment","fail","succ","clunki","exposit","dialogu","patchi","perform","veri","televis","coveragebr","onc","charm","televis","veri","ordinari","cinema","idea","flesh","almost","feel","pat","like","televis","commerci","sentim","good","ca","complain","muchbr","realli","love","see","director","make","full","length","anim","try","work","produc","doe","demand","bore","clariti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,13,15,18,36,43,48,53,54,58,70,81,105,108,116,123,131,147,215,236,248,261,262,267,272,277,336,409,417,534,547,605,663,775,797,1093,1126,1139,1344,1651,1683,1818,1823,1957,2060,2179,2932,3074,3095,4038,6114,8176,8209],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,13,15,18,36,43,48,53,54,58,70,81,105,108,116,123,131,147,215,236,248,261,262,267,272,277,336,409,417,534,547,605,663,775,797,1093,1126,1139,1344,1651,1683,1818,1823,1957,2060,2179,2932,3074,3095,4038,6114,8176,8209],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,2.2635883139467947,2.4001215597131385,1.2153159934048174,1.4680183469605717,1.6608112036218214,1.6955116224012472,1.7003182735607676,3.6227786505458823,1.865701314626681,2.094675786251684,1.949757232424728,2.1765612129984904,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,2.2619070973220485,2.2512118082053005,2.2844323215331563,2.605934685587711,2.617923930016232,2.689504733779216,2.7085302779237206,2.726701583487816,2.7085302779237206,2.8028805344481915,3.1163992333432793,2.9233055795674137,3.2209578243390444,3.1932880749197934,3.4933926673701317,3.432149042129413,3.5474598886404074,11.189344336303087,3.753391311073496,3.7987743169213135,4.150360191352575,4.240607069200353,4.186539847930077,4.477736862489302,4.6295428753573065,4.662879295624898,4.789173020949191,4.798834931860927,4.911775343041523,4.979216623837056,5.426230734858092,5.444579873526289,5.501738287366237,5.463272006538442,5.822646007446338,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079186E-4,1.9803239209117182E-4,1.9808128781854337E-4,1.9804146714364084E-4,1.9806020941939232E-4,1.980313002003047E-4,1.9809289068399737E-4,1.9800183637269834E-4,1.9803243394329344E-4,1.9823707900490465E-4,1.9981003252786644E-4,1.9803276104166453E-4,1.9822031058076088E-4,1.982409617172787E-4,1.9815090602457098E-4,1.9804224720031642E-4,1.9811038139259517E-4,1.9820361281160012E-4,1.980524712676425E-4,1.9805174716815743E-4,1.9822992482167873E-4,1.9807158993126703E-4,1.9807188969545297E-4,1.981987766687143E-4,1.9805254271015586E-4,1.9824333118607744E-4,1.981021045921645E-4,1.980319482594903E-4,1.9812172748195033E-4,1.981821970890387E-4,1.9807256150447284E-4,1.9817864485507643E-4,1.9827594562220606E-4,1.984599764441484E-4,1.9810176226615832E-4,1.9804212708455403E-4,1.9811353245559538E-4,1.980622401119633E-4,1.9800204770295573E-4,1.9805240993401509E-4,1.982508922939222E-4,1.9814213920018063E-4,1.9817909647006264E-4,1.9801190224276861E-4,1.9805246029372574E-4,1.9804205261315282E-4,1.9810908805237978E-4,1.981434404158639E-4,1.981031490669214E-4,1.9807174936779568E-4,1.9804254235593124E-4,1.9844829936360812E-4,1.9809237556434462E-4,1.9805241

{"value":"I started watching this movie expecting some barely tolerable Hammer horror film wannabe... and I wasn't far off. There's a fair amount of glimpsed gore, and they threw in lots of nudity, but the latter half of the movie presents a few ironic twists. Holy cow, they actually put a little thought into the story, and didn't completely fall into the predictable stuff one expected at the outset. And dare I say it, some of the \"gratuitous\" nudity wasn't so gratuitous after all, because it fit in with the story and setting.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's still overall a bad movie, but as bad movies go, it's a shade more intelligent than the REALLY horrible tripe like Mesa of Lost Women and Robot Monster.","finished_norm":["i","start","watch","thi","movi","expect","some","bare","toler","hammer","horror","film","wannab","and","i","be","not","far","off","there","a","fair","amount","of","glimps","gore","and","thei","throw","in","lot","of","nuditi","but","the","latter","half","of","the","movi","present","a","few","iron","twist","holi","cow","thei","actual","put","a","littl","think","into","the","stori","and","do","not","complet","fall","into","the","predict","stuff","on","expect","at","the","outset","and","dare","i","sai","it","some","of","the","gratuit","nuditi","be","not","so","gratuit","after","all","becaus","it","fit","in","with","the","stori","and","settingbr","br","do","not","get","me","wrong","it","still","overal","a","bad","movi","but","a","bad","movi","go","it","a","shade","much","intellig","than","the","realli","horribl","tripe","like","mesa","of","lose","woman","and","robot","monster"],"filtered":["start","watch","thi","movi","expect","bare","toler","hammer","horror","film","wannab","far","fair","amount","glimps","gore","thei","throw","lot","nuditi","latter","half","movi","present","iron","twist","holi","cow","thei","actual","put","littl","think","stori","complet","fall","predict","stuff","expect","outset","dare","sai","gratuit","nuditi","gratuit","becaus","fit","stori","settingbr","br","get","wrong","still","overal","bad","movi","bad","movi","go","shade","much","intellig","realli","horribl","tripe","like","mesa","lose","woman","robot","monster"],"filtered2":["start","watch","expect","bare","toler","hammer","horror","wannab","far","fair","amount","glimps","gore","throw","lot","nuditi","latter","half","present","iron","twist","holi","cow","actual","put","littl","think","stori","complet","fall","predict","stuff","expect","outset","dare","gratuit","nuditi","gratuit","becaus","fit","stori","settingbr","get","wrong","still","overal","bad","bad","go","shade","intellig","realli","horribl","tripe","like","mesa","lose","woman","robot","monster"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,7,9,12,13,14,17,22,25,52,64,70,71,72,83,101,103,130,159,169,206,221,230,310,337,358,361,411,412,413,435,594,603,612,676,771,877,1154,1246,1321,1460,1675,1741,1920,2290,2395,2403,2766,3140,3454,5964],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,7,9,12,13,14,17,22,25,52,64,70,71,72,83,101,103,130,159,169,206,221,230,310,337,358,361,411,412,413,435,594,603,612,676,771,877,1154,1246,1321,1460,1675,1741,1920,2290,2395,2403,2766,3140,3454,5964],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.5541073880211935,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.7122153074726136,1.883428577602134,2.094675786251684,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,2.292318797740072,2.098582041218749,2.098582041218749,4.528427806839927,2.300267965194495,2.4071371113909277,2.597304642813496,2.6423424573643777,2.7121382192999195,2.854312708080462,2.973659465713028,3.2030824725120812,3.0399731661399314,3.229006157521873,3.107414446935464,3.467417180966871,3.2829611516442836,3.496027715008137,3.530930586689197,7.185844525434329,3.6105180246075443,3.7398317812878634,3.865219416329466,4.589376833631972,4.315570107673808,8.741937774127193,4.4919214974812585,4.654440426979034,4.751432692966343,4.8184434032493035,5.156897801074508,5.170884043049248,5.0768550934009715,5.3064295350454715,5.541743621979936,5.695894301807195,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852453E-4,2.0810416094933757E-4,2.0815554347424276E-4,2.0811369755170697E-4,2.0813339304459253E-4,2.0810301352577543E-4,2.0816773645214104E-4,2.080720511914945E-4,2.0810420493002455E-4,2.0831925807556964E-4,2.099722107549352E-4,2.0810454866435684E-4,2.083016368228037E-4,2.0832333825958539E-4,2.0822870240647193E-4,2.081145172814403E-4,2.0818611672416987E-4,2.0828408981847662E-4,2.0812526133664216E-4,2.081245004100372E-4,2.0831174003631462E-4,2.0814535236018657E-4,2.081456673701389E-4,2.0827900771323689E-4,2.0812533641266455E-4,2.0832582823766954E-4,2.0817741897229816E-4,2.0810369454473215E-4,2.081980398665426E-4,2.0826158490941754E-4,2.081463733468275E-4,2.082578520116809E-4,2.0836010141789884E-4,2.085534919000554E-4,2.081770592358655E-4,2.0811439105668646E-4,2.081894280477106E-4,2.0813552701656128E-4,2.0807227326983952E-4,2.081251968836356E-4,2.083337738974036E-4,2.0821948970841438E-4,2.0825832659544363E-4,2.080826290036548E-4,2.0812524980460078E-4,2.0811431279772942E-4,2.0818475760570697E-4,2.0822085710288518E-4,2.0817851656820469E-4,2.0814551990552937E-4,2.081148274484333E-4,2.08541220932551E-4,2.0816719513391533E-4,2.0812520210255776E-4,2.0816608032148465E-4,2.0810390746310166E-4,0.9835521036690726,2.081363751479362E-4,2.08

{"value":"This was no Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie film. It was a big wannabee. It wanted to be an edgy, nervous-laughter, urban-life affirming film, but it's more of a camera jerky, mess. It's a lot easier to imitate something else, than to create a real story with real characters. From the beginning, I couldn't care less about the characters or what they were involved in. They were always always hitting, pissing, or crying on each other. Only, there wasn't any substance to what they were doing. The dialog between characters is meant to be hip, revealing, instead it comes out trite, and one scene after another is predictable. I know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie, so I could be wrong.","finished_norm":["thi","be","no","trainspot","or","gui","ritchi","film","it","be","a","big","wannabe","it","want","to","be","a","edgi","nervouslaught","urbanlif","affirm","film","but","it","much","of","a","camera","jerki","mess","it","a","lot","easi","to","imit","someth","els","than","to","creat","a","real","stori","with","real","charact","from","the","begin","i","can","not","care","littl","about","the","charact","or","what","thei","be","involv","in","thei","be","alwai","alwai","hit","piss","or","cry","on","each","other","onli","there","be","not","ani","substanc","to","what","thei","be","do","the","dialog","between","charact","be","mean","to","be","hip","reveal","instead","it","come","out","trite","and","on","scene","after","anoth","be","predict","i","know","there","be","viewer","out","there","that","realli","like","thi","movi","so","i","can","be","wrong"],"filtered":["thi","trainspot","gui","ritchi","film","big","wannabe","want","edgi","nervouslaught","urbanlif","affirm","film","much","camera","jerki","mess","lot","easi","imit","someth","els","creat","real","stori","real","charact","begin","care","littl","charact","thei","involv","thei","alwai","alwai","hit","piss","cry","onli","ani","substanc","thei","dialog","charact","mean","hip","reveal","instead","come","trite","scene","anoth","predict","know","viewer","realli","like","thi","movi","wrong"],"filtered2":["trainspot","gui","ritchi","big","wannabe","want","edgi","nervouslaught","urbanlif","affirm","camera","jerki","mess","lot","easi","imit","someth","els","creat","real","stori","real","charact","begin","care","littl","charact","involv","alwai","alwai","hit","piss","cry","onli","ani","substanc","dialog","charact","mean","hip","reveal","instead","come","trite","scene","anoth","predict","know","viewer","realli","like","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,10,11,13,14,17,19,25,26,27,34,37,53,55,72,73,80,82,88,147,152,196,197,205,231,241,279,337,362,388,407,432,744,833,856,1434,1684,1752,2227,3232,3621,5215,7942],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,10,11,13,14,17,19,25,26,27,34,37,53,55,72,73,80,82,88,147,152,196,197,205,231,241,279,337,362,388,407,432,744,833,856,1434,1684,1752,2227,3232,3621,5215,7942],"values":[0.6460382945576578,3.3716610723085094,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.7003182735607676,1.9536997889255368,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,3.9903607800925114,2.020196584395323,2.0317223413467334,2.2844323215331563,2.3131195476980753,2.478925055209576,5.116663665627972,2.571852579609833,2.7049353070058615,2.6627744961815836,2.7910771187233068,2.973659465713028,3.058539100262467,3.0914425013694116,3.120015873813468,3.235085203598255,3.700222643192818,3.900174431363043,3.900174431363043,4.477736862489302,4.724033718778229,4.715065048795469,5.129498826886393,5.5623629091826725,6.1754673820690815,6.255510089742618,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.560351204035197E-4,2.55808234739393E-4,2.5587139576862226E-4,2.5581995743348233E-4,2.558441677579871E-4,2.5580682428995945E-4,2.5588638376375963E-4,2.5576876440667947E-4,2.558082888018483E-4,2.5607263894884244E-4,2.581045008063244E-4,2.5580871133099124E-4,2.56050978346078E-4,2.5607765444043913E-4,2.55961325048381E-4,2.558209650712686E-4,2.559089773770746E-4,2.560294090118494E-4,2.558341720046744E-4,2.558332366495585E-4,2.560633975365527E-4,2.558588685280094E-4,2.558592557482335E-4,2.560231619269079E-4,2.558342642905022E-4,2.5608071520047073E-4,2.5589828582462147E-4,2.558076614200599E-4,2.55923633681826E-4,2.5600174526388246E-4,2.5586012355716944E-4,2.5599715666759437E-4,2.561228448805952E-4,2.5636056659471274E-4,2.558978436251893E-4,2.558208099117979E-4,2.559130477609907E-4,2.5584679090401085E-4,2.557690373924244E-4,2.5583409277699456E-4,2.560904822574154E-4,2.5595000050774447E-4,2.559977400410071E-4,2.5578176698886615E-4,2.558341578291234E-4,2.558207137134059E-4,2.5590730670555504E-4,2.5595168135239543E-4,2.558996350243204E-4,2.5585907448005856E-4,2.5582134633837344E-4,2.5634548273227803E-4,2.558857183582285E-4,2.5583409919225926E-4,2.55884347995432E-4,2.5580792314607243E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.5584783345399567E-4,2.5582170547880075E-4,2.558077771243863E-4,2.560124294824373E-4,2.559096596755834E-4,2.5580767019001876E-4,2.5578166277759036E-4,2.5575594110598853E-4,2.5598718496251E-4,2.5582020202291345E-4,2.559364883717662E-4,2.5601159924283515E-4,2.558954517621164E-4,2.5583443803604865E-4,2.5578199809030583E-4,2.5584743185131726E-4,2.5578186032295373E-4,2.557952833413214E-4,2.5578200532957394E-4,2.559480435940782E-4,2.5587186526541896E-4,2.558080116274143E-4,2.558327914289873E-4]}}

{"value":"This movie will promote the improvement of the mind. Read a book! It's incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make. I've seen \"B\" movies before but the \"C\" movie has just been invented. I didn't think I would ever enjoy Power Rangers since my kids stopped watching but I found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into \"Knights.\" High school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume. Embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind. My roommate, who loves these types of movies even turned it off. Now that has to really tell you something.

{"value":"\"In 1955, Tobias Schneerbaum disappeared in the Peruvian Amazon. One year later he walked out of the jungle...naked. It took him 45 years to go back.\" Supposedly, \"Keep the River On your Right\" is \"a modern cannibal tale\". In reality, anyone looking for some insight into cannibalism will be sadly disappointed. The first half of the movie is more like a travel log of New Ginuea, mostly touting the native art. The second half relies on still photos of a Peruvian cannibal tribe, but really that's about it.

{"value":"I'll be blunt and to the point. This film is not good at all. The film buff part of me hated the acting, script, story, direction and almost all of the editing. Amanda Peet has proven that she can act, as she was a high point of 'The Whole Nine Yards'. So she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole. However, the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny. If you can forget about how underpar the production quality is, and if you find smut jokes funny, then you should be all right. And for those of you who can't get off your pedestal, thats your choice. My inner child hasen't died, and I laughed a fair bit. Even then, only a 3 out of ten, because as a movie, it really does stink.","finished_norm":["i","will","be","blunt","and","to","the","point","thi","film","be","not","good","at","all","the","film","buff","part","of","me","hate","the","act","script","stori","direct","and","almost","all","of","the","edit","amanda","peet","have","prove","that","she","can","act","a","she","be","a","high","point","of","the","whole","nine","yard","so","she","should","have","avoid","thi","movi","with","a","ten","foot","pole","howev","the","infantil","part","of","me","find","thi","film","to","be","veri","funni","if","you","can","forget","about","how","underpar","the","product","qualiti","be","and","if","you","find","smut","joke","funni","then","you","should","be","all","right","and","for","that","of","you","who","ca","not","get","off","your","pedest","that","your","choic","my","inner","child","hase","not","die","and","i","laugh","a","fair","bite","even","then","onli","a","out","of","ten","becaus","a","a","movi","it","realli","doe","stink"],"filtered":["blunt","point","thi","film","good","film","buff","part","hate","act","script","stori","direct","almost","edit","amanda","peet","prove","act","high","point","whole","nine","yard","avoid","thi","movi","ten","foot","pole","howev","infantil","part","find","thi","film","veri","funni","forget","underpar","product","qualiti","find","smut","joke","funni","right","ca","get","pedest","choic","inner","child","hase","die","laugh","fair","bite","even","onli","ten","becaus","movi","realli","doe","stink"],"filtered2":["blunt","point","good","buff","part","hate","act","script","stori","direct","almost","edit","amanda","peet","prove","act","high","point","whole","nine","yard","avoid","ten","foot","pole","howev","infantil","part","find","veri","funni","forget","underpar","product","qualiti","find","smut","joke","funni","right","ca","get","pedest","choic","inner","child","hase","die","laugh","fair","bite","even","onli","ten","becaus","realli","doe","stink"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,5,11,13,15,17,18,21,22,38,61,62,66,77,81,102,111,113,121,131,133,154,180,190,211,214,293,319,335,339,348,372,540,545,809,877,981,1409,2326,2757,2922,3173,3392,3862,5142,6712,6908],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,5,11,13,15,17,18,21,22,38,61,62,66,77,81,102,111,113,121,131,133,154,180,190,211,214,293,319,335,339,348,372,540,545,809,877,981,1409,2326,2757,2922,3173,3392,3862,5142,6712,6908],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,2.324031090670098,1.2979240167361772,3.038623282696244,3.7637034094785053,4.045224089013853,3.859446346783224,1.9463902258768238,1.949757232424728,2.087553710177271,2.1183455303375887,2.1521782565202803,2.2190595059394194,2.2512118082053005,2.3212364753796515,2.348499626138016,2.7097314792693545,2.558331832813986,2.5687161421197025,2.7303758068497004,2.9012296278682137,2.9056060024680126,2.908534262247101,3.003844442051426,3.0103169565570433,3.0316467233633775,3.432149042129413,6.884198745965162,3.8023521382691974,3.865219416329466,4.039936373738201,4.477736862489302,5.089758498236879,5.3560264761848435,5.482320201509136,5.5623629091826725,5.672363804397,5.878215858601149,6.1754673820690815,6.543192162194399,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164682E-4,2.2324275812784237E-4,2.2329787848933384E-4,2.2325298847310026E-4,2.232741167202934E-4,2.2324152723462241E-4,2.233109584489242E-4,2.232083125364087E-4,2.232428053079171E-4,2.2347350255652829E-4,2.2524669975505142E-4,2.2324317404730248E-4,2.234545994406502E-4,2.2347787955470647E-4,2.2337635938917755E-4,2.2325386783430935E-4,2.2333067579914027E-4,2.234357759744351E-4,2.2326539346890405E-4,2.2326457718847386E-4,2.2346543761534042E-4,2.2328694601974784E-4,2.2328728394518997E-4,2.2343032416998469E-4,2.2326547400635332E-4,2.2348055066696414E-4,2.2332134532680132E-4,2.232422577944995E-4,2.2334346629394197E-4,2.23411633939279E-4,2.2328804127835626E-4,2.2340762949082043E-4,2.2351731705956915E-4,2.2372477578809892E-4,2.2332095942123817E-4,2.2325373242729936E-4,2.2333422800586652E-4,2.2327640592866818E-4,2.2320855076990694E-4,2.2326532432724494E-4,2.2348907433600605E-4,2.2336647651074407E-4,2.234081385983158E-4,2.232196598345639E-4,2.23265381097961E-4,2.2325364847537195E-4,2.2332921781121297E-4,2.2336794337671982E-4,2.2332252276763848E-4,2.2328712575322488E-4,2.2325420056448965E-4,2.2371161216552606E-4,2.2331037775234812E-4,2.232653299258191E-4,2.2330918184256578E-4,2.2324248620167716E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760444E-4,2.2325451398481262E-4,2.2324235876917294E-4,2.234209580113561E-4,2.2333127123814605E-4,2.232422654480053E-4,2.2321956888982688E-4,2.231971216964521E-4,2.2339892722621769E-4,2.232532019252562E-4,2.23354684527162

{"value":"The first mistake you make in titling a film is to use \"of the living dead\" without really having a budget for real zombie FX. Sure, this was a low budget zombie flick - really low budget. I thought it was a film school project. Amateur actors and amateur effects.<br /><br />It was really not too bad considering the above, and it presented an interesting twist to the zombie genre. If you are going to get an \"R\" for violence, you might as well give us some good shots of the babes being attacked. The women were so little used in this film that it could almost be classified as \"gay interest.\"<br /><br />And, I am staying out of Oakland.

{"value":"I have to admit I did not finish this movie because it was so amazingly stupid and not worth watching. I watched it with a room full of kids, who also were not laughing at the stupid and crude humor. The director, Bob Dolman, seems to be so obsessed with sphincters and genitalia that it overrides the real story that I grew up with. THIS IS NOT A GOOD FILM FOR KIDS! Besides the fact that the content is so crude, the movie is just stupid has bad flow and has no intelligence behind it. What a waste of a perfectly good story. If you read the book when you were younger and loved it, then don't waste your time watching a movie that so badly botches it that it makes you angry. Buy your kids the book instead.","finished_norm":["i","have","to","admit","i","do","not","finish","thi","movi","becaus","it","be","so","amazingli","stupid","and","not","worth","watch","i","watch","it","with","a","room","full","of","kid","who","conjur","be","not","laugh","at","the","stupid","and","crude","humor","the","director","bob","dolman","seem","to","be","so","obsess","with","sphincter","and","genitalia","that","it","overrid","the","real","stori","that","i","grow","up","with","thi","be","not","a","good","film","for","kid","besid","the","fact","that","the","content","be","so","crude","the","movi","be","just","stupid","have","bad","flow","and","have","no","intellig","behind","it","what","a","wast","of","a","perfectli","good","stori","if","you","read","the","book","when","you","be","young","and","love","it","then","do","not","wast","your","time","watch","a","movi","that","so","badli","botch","it","that","it","make","you","angri","bui","your","kid","the","book","instead"],"filtered":["admit","finish","thi","movi","becaus","amazingli","stupid","worth","watch","watch","room","full","kid","conjur","laugh","stupid","crude","humor","director","bob","dolman","seem","obsess","sphincter","genitalia","overrid","real","stori","grow","thi","good","film","kid","besid","fact","content","crude","movi","stupid","bad","flow","intellig","behind","wast","perfectli","good","stori","read","book","young","love","wast","time","watch","movi","badli","botch","make","angri","bui","kid","book","instead"],"filtered2":["admit","finish","becaus","amazingli","stupid","worth","watch","watch","room","full","kid","conjur","laugh","stupid","crude","humor","director","bob","dolman","seem","obsess","sphincter","genitalia","overrid","real","stori","grow","good","kid","besid","fact","content","crude","stupid","bad","flow","intellig","behind","wast","perfectli","good","stori","read","book","young","love","wast","time","watch","badli","botch","make","angri","bui","kid","book","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,8,9,17,22,35,39,54,58,80,89,97,114,133,135,136,145,151,152,219,336,347,369,393,448,513,561,573,603,691,972,1122,1142,1161,1475,1687,1793,1899,2243,4869,8375],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,7,8,9,17,22,35,39,54,58,80,89,97,114,133,135,136,145,151,152,219,336,347,369,393,448,513,561,573,603,691,972,1122,1142,1161,1475,1687,1793,1899,2243,4869,8375],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.5541073880211935,1.2979240167361772,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,1.8113893252729412,1.865701314626681,1.9951803900462557,3.9880092219144876,2.0545557924622586,7.329922258790048,2.3212364753796515,2.366244071437088,7.040477956739958,2.34599021453259,5.6004909736203725,2.3131195476980753,2.5792094178355414,2.9233055795674137,3.0151989841543516,3.121829110937649,3.120015873813468,3.2681460658591432,3.454678155189441,3.4725585804672896,3.4623020803001006,3.530930586689197,3.5929222627171646,3.9911462095687695,4.263079925052412,4.263079925052412,4.327618446189983,4.4919214974812585,4.770124825978496,9.738431457245454,4.828393734102471,5.039114765418124,6.1754673820690815,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164668E-4,2.232427581278422E-4,2.232978784893337E-4,2.232529884731001E-4,2.2327411672029324E-4,2.2324152723462228E-4,2.2331095844892407E-4,2.2320831253640856E-4,2.2324280530791696E-4,2.2347350255652815E-4,2.2524669975505128E-4,2.2324317404730232E-4,2.2345459944065008E-4,2.234778795547063E-4,2.2337635938917742E-4,2.232538678343092E-4,2.233306757991401E-4,2.2343577597443495E-4,2.232653934689039E-4,2.2326457718847373E-4,2.234654376153403E-4,2.2328694601974768E-4,2.2328728394518984E-4,2.2343032416998452E-4,2.2326547400635318E-4,2.2348055066696398E-4,2.2332134532680118E-4,2.2324225779449933E-4,2.233434662939418E-4,2.2341163393927883E-4,2.2328804127835612E-4,2.234076294908203E-4,2.23517317059569E-4,2.2372477578809876E-4,2.23320959421238E-4,2.2325373242729923E-4,2.2333422800586638E-4,2.2327640592866802E-4,2.232085507699068E-4,2.2326532432724477E-4,2.234890743360059E-4,2.233664765107439E-4,2.2340813859831566E-4,2.2321965983456376E-4,2.2326538109796086E-4,2.2325364847537181E-4,2.2332921781121283E-4,2.2336794337671968E-4,2.2332252276763834E-4,2.2328712575322475E-4,2.232542005644895E-4,2.237116121655259E-4,2.2331037775234799E-4,2.2326532992581895E-4,2.2330918184256565E-4,2.2324248620167702E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760428E-4,2.2325451398481246E-4,2.232423587691728E-4,2.2342095801135595E-4,2.233312712381459E-4,2.2324226544800514E-4,2.2321956888982674E-4,2.2319712169645195E-4,2.2339892722621752E-4,2.2325320192525603E-4,2.233546845271627E-4,2.2342023346478738E-4,2.2331887205251046E-4,2.232656256333524E-4,2.2321986151580697E-4,2.2327696528065546E-4,2.23219

{"value":"I am quite sure that this was the worst movie ever made. If you can't make a 13 year old boy laugh at silly humor you should give up comedy forever. Unfortunately Joan Rivers chose differently. The movie is full of predictable gags (some of these are racist) and very unfunny jokes. Particularly memorable is the scene where the doctor tells the lead character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant (as I write this, I cannot believe this was actually a movie scene).

{"value":"wow i payed £3.50 to go see this movie at the cinema. Cant believe i wasted my time. The acting is cringe worthy at best and the special effects are crude. Probarly the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes i have ever heard in my life. I swear to god 'swept away' is better than this. Madonna should of won and Oscar compared to these guys. An hour and a half of my life i want back. Honestly people don't see this, even toddler would find this movie an insult to their intelligence. i found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who is more wooden, theses guys

{"value":"This film is so bad - dialogues, story, actors and actresses - everything! - that it's hard to imagine that we'll see a worse movie this year or in the following years. \"Love's Brother\" (set in Australia among Italian immigrants) has nothing but shallow clichés about Italian culture to offer, and it is quite telling that even the Italians from and in Italy speak ENGLISH in the film. The message of the film - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - is truly discomforting. Giovanni Ribisi is quite good in films like 'Suburbia' or 'Lost in Translation', but here his pseudo-Italian accent is hard to bear. See this film at your own risk.

{"value":"I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 because I think \"The Wild Women of Wongo\" is worse. This is an exercise in patience. It's like having your teeth cleaned by a bad dental hygienist. There's no plot. There's no logic. There is certainly no acting (although the shark has some quality dialogue). We don't wonder about anything. We don't know how people got where they got. It's always amazing to me how things like this even get released. I agree with the previous writer that it isn't even funny bad. I know. It's about 90 minutes long and that will fill up about that much space on a DVD collection. It's like a paperweight. Or a bad painting you bought at a starving artists' sale. It covers the crack in the wall.","finished_norm":["i","give","it","a","instead","of","a","becaus","i","think","the","wild","woman","of","wongo","be","wrong","thi","be","a","exercis","in","patienc","it","like","have","your","tooth","clean","by","a","bad","dental","hygienist","there","no","plot","there","no","logic","there","be","certainli","no","act","although","the","shark","have","some","qualiti","dialogu","we","do","not","wonder","about","anyth","we","do","not","know","how","peopl","get","where","thei","get","it","alwai","amaz","to","me","how","thing","like","thi","even","get","releas","i","agre","with","the","previou","writer","that","it","be","not","even","funni","bad","i","know","it","about","minut","long","and","that","will","fill","up","about","that","much","space","on","a","dvd","collect","it","like","a","paperweight","or","a","bad","paint","you","bui","at","a","starv","artist","sale","it","cover","the","crack","in","the","wall"],"filtered":["give","instead","becaus","think","wild","woman","wongo","wrong","thi","exercis","patienc","like","tooth","clean","bad","dental","hygienist","plot","logic","certainli","act","although","shark","qualiti","dialogu","wonder","anyth","know","peopl","get","thei","get","alwai","amaz","thing","like","thi","even","get","releas","agre","previou","writer","even","funni","bad","know","minut","long","fill","much","space","dvd","collect","like","paperweight","bad","paint","bui","starv","artist","sale","cover","crack","wall"],"filtered2":["give","instead","becaus","think","wild","woman","wongo","wrong","exercis","patienc","like","tooth","clean","bad","dental","hygienist","plot","logic","certainli","act","although","shark","qualiti","dialogu","wonder","anyth","know","peopl","get","get","alwai","amaz","thing","like","even","get","releas","agre","previou","writer","even","funni","bad","know","minut","long","fill","space","dvd","collect","like","paperweight","bad","paint","bui","starv","artist","sale","cover","crack","wall"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,9,12,21,22,23,25,26,29,30,32,59,62,70,99,104,152,175,197,237,247,248,287,319,327,347,389,491,553,622,637,685,724,784,868,973,1026,1085,1107,1212,1495,1701,1925,2082,3084,3452,4359],"values":[3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,9,12,21,22,23,25,26,29,30,32,59,62,70,99,104,152,175,197,237,247,248,287,319,327,347,389,491,553,622,637,685,724,784,868,973,1026,1085,1107,1212,1495,1701,1925,2082,3084,3452,4359],"values":[1.9381148836729736,2.389902141215977,1.852034211452262,3.205071257016622,1.066728610262888,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.8693254449200722,2.0226120445069267,2.094675786251684,2.056430207256609,2.0728240170322856,2.3131195476980753,2.3791142619576227,2.558331832813986,2.640097787510554,2.7303758068497004,2.689504733779216,2.841890188081905,2.9056060024680126,2.9674191958529437,3.0151989841543516,3.0914425013694116,3.369778711402955,3.454678155189441,3.4933926673701317,3.7432044657665027,3.607563812710113,3.7987743169213135,3.7636829971100436,3.944626193933877,4.072271754381138,4.062925891962901,4.176068548062782,4.268777946167049,4.550761997504193,4.5432147918688095,5.274680836730892,4.828393734102471,4.944927550358424,5.463272006538442,5.583416318380505,5.907203395474402]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612973E-4,2.1169300653874423E-4,2.1174527517734863E-4,2.1170270760391532E-4,2.1172274275403047E-4,2.116918393273702E-4,2.1175767842838492E-4,2.1166034303434324E-4,2.1169305127789707E-4,2.1191181310725393E-4,2.1359327166514577E-4,2.1169340094007543E-4,2.1189388796841969E-4,2.1191596365579453E-4,2.1181969576676937E-4,2.117035414702398E-4,2.1177637567609508E-4,2.1187603835847048E-4,2.1171447081128576E-4,2.1171369676217488E-4,2.1190416541618464E-4,2.1173490831315574E-4,2.1173522875558994E-4,2.1187086861014428E-4,2.117145471820264E-4,2.1191849657461963E-4,2.1176752792775858E-4,2.116925320907912E-4,2.117885044381763E-4,2.1185314534259388E-4,2.117359469071496E-4,2.1184934806943337E-4,2.119533608105546E-4,2.1215008639459355E-4,2.117671619875167E-4,2.1170341306868588E-4,2.1177974410483173E-4,2.117249135272619E-4,2.1166056894252467E-4,2.117144052467594E-4,2.1192657926066667E-4,2.1181032419177905E-4,2.118498308375968E-4,2.1167110326541507E-4,2.1171445908036937E-4,2.1170333346011953E-4,2.1177499311905083E-4,2.1181171516755447E-4,2.117686444521777E-4,2.1173507874788991E-4,2.1170385698619573E-4,2.1213760380898693E-4,2.1175712777489402E-4,2.1171441055568415E-4,2.1175599373704442E-4,2.1169274868102937E-4,0.9832684526361813,2.1172577628502642E-4,2.1170415419131467E-4,2.116926278414099E-4,2.1186198702179433E-4,2.1177694030929706E-4,2.1169253934833304E-4,2.1167101702582116E-4,2.1164973116690364

They are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these histrionic and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books.<br /><br />It is indeed your property to do with as you wish.

So I have to say all I got out of this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was. So I was at least somewhat amused by it. Personally, I'd recommend going and seeing Jaws if you're wanting to see an Animal-Killing-Humans type of movie. But if you're like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then I'd say go ahead.

{"value":"In film, I feel as though it should be more than just art. I think it should be more than that, a way to tell a story on screen. This short from David Lynch tells a story but not much of one. I felt that it was funny but too bizarre to be a comedy. It is good film-making but there really isn't anything else to it. As I've said before, I am a huge David Lynch fan but I get frustrated by some of his work because I don't see a need for it at all. This is definitely my least favorite thing he has done so far but I know he's still got a ton of talent and I am excited to see what he has in store for us in the future. If you like Lynch, check this out but don't be surprised when you don't like it very much.","finished_norm":["in","film","i","feel","a","though","it","should","be","much","than","just","art","i","think","it","should","be","much","than","that","a","wai","to","tell","a","stori","on","screen","thi","short","from","david","lynch","tell","a","stori","but","not","much","of","on","i","feel","that","it","be","funni","but","too","bizarr","to","be","a","comedi","it","be","good","filmmak","but","there","realli","be","not","anyth","els","to","it","a","i","have","sai","befor","i","be","a","huge","david","lynch","fan","but","i","get","frustrat","by","some","of","hi","work","becaus","i","do","not","see","a","ne","for","it","at","all","thi","be","definit","my","littl","favorit","thing","he","have","do","so","far","but","i","know","he","still","get","a","ton","of","talent","and","i","be","excit","to","see","what","he","have","in","store","for","u","in","the","futur","if","you","like","lynch","check","thi","out","but","do","not","be","surpris","when","you","do","not","like","it","veri","much"],"filtered":["film","feel","though","much","art","think","much","wai","tell","stori","screen","thi","short","david","lynch","tell","stori","much","feel","funni","bizarr","comedi","good","filmmak","realli","anyth","els","sai","befor","huge","david","lynch","fan","get","frustrat","hi","work","becaus","see","ne","thi","definit","littl","favorit","thing","far","know","still","get","ton","talent","excit","see","store","u","futur","like","lynch","check","thi","surpris","like","veri","much"],"filtered2":["feel","though","art","think","wai","tell","stori","screen","short","david","lynch","tell","stori","feel","funni","bizarr","comedi","good","filmmak","realli","anyth","els","befor","huge","david","lynch","fan","get","frustrat","work","becaus","see","ne","definit","littl","favorit","thing","far","know","still","get","ton","talent","excit","see","store","u","futur","like","lynch","check","surpris","like","veri"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,12,13,14,15,17,22,26,29,33,43,48,62,64,79,86,90,101,104,110,112,127,140,192,196,272,276,323,326,382,392,444,505,524,675,793,822,823,844,1366,1806,1955],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,12,13,14,15,17,22,26,29,33,43,48,62,64,79,86,90,101,104,110,112,127,140,192,196,272,276,323,326,382,392,444,505,524,675,793,822,823,844,1366,1806,1955],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,3.321622407243643,1.6955116224012472,2.0226120445069267,1.883428577602134,1.9469506069506084,2.031112399272319,4.095425683930709,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.1290479736304078,2.2466628996789315,2.4359679371086367,2.317169775997098,2.5318267134339894,2.478925055209576,2.8028805344481915,2.7884729505849193,3.0433232530252132,2.942840385588056,3.235085203598255,3.0670934723591254,3.2535472664379905,3.41740676039221,3.4028786598293,7.499968305503764,3.770603439954617,3.813163054373413,3.850067611308864,3.8690435127678695,4.422928625994308,15.429313436826517,4.869215728622727]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164674E-4,2.2324275812784226E-4,2.2329787848933375E-4,2.2325298847310015E-4,2.232741167202933E-4,2.2324152723462233E-4,2.2331095844892412E-4,2.232083125364086E-4,2.2324280530791702E-4,2.234735025565282E-4,2.2524669975505134E-4,2.232431740473024E-4,2.2345459944065013E-4,2.2347787955470639E-4,2.2337635938917747E-4,2.2325386783430924E-4,2.233306757991402E-4,2.23435775974435E-4,2.2326539346890394E-4,2.2326457718847378E-4,2.2346543761534034E-4,2.2328694601974776E-4,2.232872839451899E-4,2.2343032416998458E-4,2.2326547400635324E-4,2.2348055066696406E-4,2.2332134532680124E-4,2.2324225779449939E-4,2.2334346629394186E-4,2.2341163393927889E-4,2.2328804127835617E-4,2.2340762949082035E-4,2.2351731705956906E-4,2.2372477578809882E-4,2.233209594212381E-4,2.2325373242729928E-4,2.2333422800586644E-4,2.232764059286681E-4,2.2320855076990686E-4,2.2326532432724483E-4,2.2348907433600597E-4,2.23366476510744E-4,2.234081385983157E-4,2.232196598345638E-4,2.232653810979609E-4,2.2325364847537187E-4,2.233292178112129E-4,2.2336794337671974E-4,2.233225227676384E-4,2.232871257532248E-4,2.2325420056448956E-4,2.2371161216552595E-4,2.2331037775234804E-4,2.23265329925819E-4,2.233091818425657E-4,2.2324248620167708E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760436E-4,2.2325451398481252E-4,2.2324235876917286E-4,2.23420958011356E-4,2.2333127123814596E-4,2.2324226544800523E-4,2.232195688898268E-4,2.2319712169645203E-4,2.2339892722621758E-4,2.2325320192525608E-4,2.2335468452716275E-4,2.2342023346478743E-4,2.2331887205251052E-4,2.2326562563335244E-4,2.2321986151580702E-4,2.2327696528065552E-4,2.2321974

{"value":"Rumor has it that when the NASA Technical Advisors to this film were asked to keep the picture believable, they laughed for several hours. After all, unless you are a politician or work/crew the shuttle, you are not going to get in the shuttle.

{"value":"Follow-up to 1973's \"Walking Tall\" continues the real-life drama surrounding Tennessee sheriff Buford Pusser, but this installment plays like a lame TV-movie. Bo Svenson takes over the lead role from Joe Don Baker, but he's much too mild for the part; he comes off like an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. Good supporting actors like Richard Jaekel, Luke Askew and Robert DoQui end up with very little to do. I would give the film one-star strictly on its good intentions, but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack. Followed in 1977 by \"Final Chapter-Walking Tall\" and in 1978 by the television film \"A Real American Hero\".","finished_norm":["followup","to","walk","tall","continu","the","reallif","drama","surround","tennesse","sheriff","buford","pusser","but","thi","instal","plai","like","a","lame","tvmovi","bo","svenson","take","over","the","lead","role","from","joe","don","baker","but","he","much","too","mild","for","the","part","he","come","off","like","a","ambl","countri","singer","with","a","bat","instead","of","a","guitar","good","support","actor","like","richard","jaekel","luke","askew","and","robert","doqui","end","up","with","veri","littl","to","do","i","would","give","the","film","onestar","strictli","on","it","good","intent","but","the","screenplai","be","a","transpar","and","lazi","mass","of","routin","predica","and","the","product","be","cheapjack","follow","in","by","final","chapterwalk","tall","and","in","by","the","televis","film","a","real","american","hero"],"filtered":["followup","walk","tall","continu","reallif","drama","surround","tennesse","sheriff","buford","pusser","thi","instal","plai","like","lame","tvmovi","bo","svenson","take","lead","role","joe","baker","much","mild","part","come","like","ambl","countri","singer","bat","instead","guitar","good","support","actor","like","richard","jaekel","luke","askew","robert","doqui","end","veri","littl","give","film","onestar","strictli","good","intent","screenplai","transpar","lazi","mass","routin","predica","product","cheapjack","follow","final","chapterwalk","tall","televis","film","real","american","hero"],"filtered2":["followup","walk","tall","continu","reallif","drama","surround","tennesse","sheriff","buford","pusser","instal","plai","like","lame","tvmovi","bo","svenson","take","lead","role","joe","baker","mild","part","come","like","ambl","countri","singer","bat","instead","guitar","good","support","actor","like","richard","jaekel","luke","askew","robert","doqui","end","veri","littl","give","onestar","strictli","good","intent","screenplai","transpar","lazi","mass","routin","predica","product","cheapjack","follow","final","chapterwalk","tall","televis","real","american","hero"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,14,15,24,30,31,34,40,41,61,80,128,152,156,157,190,223,260,294,373,375,433,459,463,539,608,641,663,703,811,821,1275,1453,1474,1530,1573,1644,1671,1830,2163,2321,2335,2501,2536,2553,3268,4124,4259,5269,7315,7648,8495],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,14,15,24,30,31,34,40,41,61,80,128,152,156,157,190,223,260,294,373,375,433,459,463,539,608,641,663,703,811,821,1275,1453,1474,1530,1573,1644,1671,1830,2163,2321,2335,2501,2536,2553,3268,4124,4259,5269,7315,7648,8495],"values":[1.9381148836729736,1.357228929984541,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.3210361566119257,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.8818517047392527,1.9951803900462557,2.3409902041158843,2.3131195476980753,2.3451551414151686,2.3360150694757706,2.558331832813986,2.825563294794476,2.6754694156628323,2.886778509330039,3.070535816550098,3.2597778161886266,3.164467636384302,3.2850956241729166,3.3467891931782563,3.6105180246075443,3.616452760127359,3.7034641371169887,3.7297814454343623,3.6746621462132825,3.8425769395797067,4.339813719283801,4.3095999406873045,4.74221603786142,5.089758498236879,4.605250182788262,4.605250182788262,4.890269137820559,5.3560264761848435,4.8796870284900224,5.089758498236879,5.444579873526289,5.0768550934009715,5.156897801074508,10.781025304512026,5.501738287366237,5.649374286172302,5.850044981634453,6.032366538428407,6.214688095222362,6.794506590475304,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612995E-4,2.1169300653874447E-4,2.1174527517734887E-4,2.1170270760391554E-4,2.117227427540307E-4,2.1169183932737045E-4,2.1175767842838514E-4,2.116603430343435E-4,2.116930512778973E-4,2.1191181310725415E-4,2.1359327175462595E-4,2.1169340094007568E-4,2.118938879684199E-4,2.1191596365579478E-4,2.1181969576676958E-4,2.1170354147024003E-4,2.117763756760953E-4,2.1187603835847073E-4,2.1171447081128598E-4,2.117136967621751E-4,2.1190416541618486E-4,2.11734908313156E-4,2.1173522875559019E-4,2.1187086861014452E-4,2.1171454718202663E-4,2.1191849657461987E-4,2.1176752792775882E-4,2.1169253209079144E-4,2.1178850443817653E-4,2.118531453425941E-4,2.117359469071498E-4,2.1184934806943358E-4,2.1195336081055482E-4,2.121500863945938E-4,2.1176716198751695E-4,2.1170341306868612E-4,2.1177974410483194E-4,2.117249135272621E-4,2.116605689425249E-4,2.1171440524675965E-4,2.1192657926066692E-4,2.1181032419177926E-4,2.1184983083759703E-4,2.116711032654153E-4,2.117144590803696E-4,2.1170333346011975E-4,2.1177499311905108E-4,2.1181171516755472E-4,2.1176864445217794E-4,2.1173507874789013E-4,2.1170385698619597E-4,2.1213760380898718E-4,2.117571

{"value":"This was a watershed event in my movie watching life. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was completely amazed at just how bad it was. Movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very, very large favor. The special effects are absolutely first grade level, as in any first grader could have done them. Toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings, arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you'd find on a street sign, and a laughable story line. Ed Wood made masterpieces compared to \"Conquest\".

{"value":"I have to say this is one of the worst films I've ever seen. They had a pretty good storyline to go on, but than the messed it up so badly. First of all the cast is all wrong, where did that van peeble(crap actor btw) and puff daddy come from??? It looks like Carlito has come from the hood, and used to hang about with some real idiots. This film doesn't do \"Carlitos Way\" any justice. Im so happy that the sequel \"Carlito's Way\" came out first, if I had seen this rubbish first, I would have never given the pacino version a chance. And anyway, pacino is supposed to have read this story, thought it's crap and did the sequel instead. Carlito's Way: Rise to Power - 1 out of 10. Carlito's Way - 9 out of 10.","finished_norm":["i","have","to","sai","thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","thei","have","a","pretti","good","storylin","to","go","on","but","than","the","mess","it","up","so","badli","of","all","the","cast","be","all","wrong","where","do","that","van","peeblecrap","actor","btw","and","puff","daddi","come","from","it","look","like","carlito","have","come","from","the","hood","and","us","to","hang","about","with","some","real","idiot","thi","film","doe","not","do","carlito","wai","ani","justic","im","so","happi","that","the","sequel","carlito","wai","come","out","if","i","have","see","thi","rubbish","i","would","have","never","give","the","pacino","version","a","chanc","and","anywai","pacino","be","suppos","to","have","read","thi","stori","think","it","crap","and","do","the","sequel","instead","carlito","wai","rise","to","power","out","of","carlito","wai","out","of"],"filtered":["sai","thi","wrong","film","ever","see","thei","pretti","good","storylin","go","mess","badli","cast","wrong","van","peeblecrap","actor","btw","puff","daddi","come","look","like","carlito","come","hood","us","hang","real","idiot","thi","film","doe","carlito","wai","ani","justic","im","happi","sequel","carlito","wai","come","see","thi","rubbish","never","give","pacino","version","chanc","anywai","pacino","suppos","read","thi","stori","think","crap","sequel","instead","carlito","wai","rise","power","carlito","wai"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","see","pretti","good","storylin","go","mess","badli","cast","wrong","van","peeblecrap","actor","btw","puff","daddi","come","look","like","carlito","come","hood","us","hang","real","idiot","doe","carlito","wai","ani","justic","im","happi","sequel","carlito","wai","come","see","rubbish","never","give","pacino","version","chanc","anywai","pacino","suppos","read","stori","think","crap","sequel","instead","carlito","wai","rise","power","carlito","wai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,12,16,17,18,25,27,30,33,34,41,42,44,56,78,80,92,145,149,152,220,313,365,386,387,407,448,486,515,605,705,818,848,922,1098,1424,1802,2298,2346,2710,2719,3634],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,12,16,17,18,25,27,30,33,34,41,42,44,56,78,80,92,145,149,152,220,313,365,386,387,407,448,486,515,605,705,818,848,922,1098,1424,1802,2298,2346,2710,2719,3634],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,5.607414179074086,4.194855026837689,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.8610609350701788,2.0064197866819473,1.9951803900462557,2.0489535369135887,2.34599021453259,2.3253197803590226,2.3131195476980753,2.8336934208777267,2.907069060519773,3.185521045582134,3.0433232530252132,6.721038771980316,3.120015873813468,3.2681460658591432,3.3066947359763783,3.3956930001684253,3.5474598886404074,3.6590123745461547,4.202455303235976,3.827761853794566,4.030886538218284,4.186539847930077,4.5432147918688095,5.0768550934009715,11.043081829324834,5.259176650194926,5.463272006538442,31.490348520807068,5.719991853386255]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852442E-4,2.0810416094933746E-4,2.0815554347424268E-4,2.0811369755170686E-4,2.0813339304459242E-4,2.0810301352577532E-4,2.0816773645214096E-4,2.0807205119149439E-4,2.0810420493002447E-4,2.0831925807556954E-4,2.099722107549351E-4,2.0810454866435673E-4,2.083016368228036E-4,2.0832333825958528E-4,2.0822870240647183E-4,2.0811451728144022E-4,2.081861167241698E-4,2.0828408981847654E-4,2.0812526133664205E-4,2.0812450041003713E-4,2.0831174003631451E-4,2.0814535236018646E-4,2.081456673701388E-4,2.082790077132368E-4,2.0812533641266447E-4,2.0832582823766946E-4,2.0817741897229805E-4,2.0810369454473207E-4,2.0819803986654248E-4,2.0826158490941743E-4,2.081463733468274E-4,2.0825785201168082E-4,2.0836010141789873E-4,2.085534919000553E-4,2.0817705923586538E-4,2.0811439105668635E-4,2.081894280477105E-4,2.081355270165612E-4,2.080722732698394E-4,2.0812519688363548E-4,2.0833377389740352E-4,2.0821948970841427E-4,2.0825832659544354E-4,2.0808262900365472E-4,2.0812524980460067E-4,2.081143127977293E-4,2.0818475760570689E-4,2.0822085710288507E-4,2.0817851656820458E-4,2.0814551990552927E-4,2.081148274484332E-4,2.085412209325509E-4,2.0816719513391523E-4,2.0812520210255767E-4,2.0816608032148454E-4,2.0810390746310155E-4,0.9835521036657285,2.0813637849204463E-4,2.0811511961501403E-4,2.0810378867208417E-4,2.0827027669504357E-4,2.0818667178510762E-4,2.0810370167923632E-4,2.0808254422608635E-4,2.0806161922774777E-4,2.0824973986735548E-4,2.0811389652918854E-4,2.0820849736595407E-4,2.0826960128161924E-4,2.081751134163401E-4,2.0812547775749332E-4,2.0808281700843593E-4,2.08136
