{"value":"Rex Reed once said of a movie (\"Julia and Julia\" to be specific) that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice. I was reminded of that as I snored through Purple Butterfly. This one appeared to be shot through gauze.<br /><br />The story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors' faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time. <br /><br />Also, everyone looked the same so it was hard to distinguish among the characters. I call this the \"Dead Poets Society\" syndrome.<br /><br />There was nobody to care about, nobody to become interested in dramatically, and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances.<br /><br />A total disappointment.","finished_norm":["rex","re","onc","sai","of","a","movi","julia","and","julia","to","be","specif","that","it","look","like","it","be","shoot","through","pomegran","juic","i","be","remind","of","that","a","i","snore","through","purpl","butterfli","thi","on","appear","to","be","shoot","through","gauzebr","br","the","stori","be","bore","and","it","be","not","help","that","for","larg","portion","of","scene","actor","face","be","liter","out","of","focu","or","would","onli","come","into","focu","after","extend","period","of","time","br","br","conjur","everyon","look","the","same","so","it","be","hard","to","distinguish","among","the","charact","i","call","thi","the","dead","poet","societi","syndromebr","br","there","be","nobodi","to","care","about","nobodi","to","becom","interest","in","dramat","and","the","movi","shed","no","histor","light","on","a","veri","interest","period","of","time","and","set","of","circumstancesbr","br","a","total","disappoint"],"filtered":["rex","re","onc","sai","movi","julia","julia","specif","look","like","shoot","pomegran","juic","remind","snore","purpl","butterfli","thi","appear","shoot","gauzebr","br","stori","bore","help","larg","portion","scene","actor","face","liter","focu","onli","come","focu","extend","period","time","br","br","conjur","everyon","look","hard","distinguish","among","charact","call","thi","dead","poet","societi","syndromebr","br","nobodi","care","nobodi","becom","interest","dramat","movi","shed","histor","light","veri","interest","period","time","set","circumstancesbr","br","total","disappoint"],"filtered2":["rex","re","onc","julia","julia","specif","look","like","shoot","pomegran","juic","remind","snore","purpl","butterfli","appear","shoot","gauzebr","stori","bore","help","larg","portion","scene","actor","face","liter","focu","onli","come","focu","extend","period","time","conjur","everyon","look","hard","distinguish","among","charact","call","dead","poet","societi","syndromebr","nobodi","care","nobodi","becom","interest","dramat","shed","histor","light","veri","interest","period","time","set","circumstancesbr","total","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,8,10,11,15,16,17,19,34,39,41,60,68,108,109,115,117,142,170,171,184,185,187,205,228,236,246,251,353,564,619,644,743,756,826,866,897,953,1049,1662,2415,2431,2579,2997,3719,3827,4279,4312,6405,6555,7140],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,8,10,11,15,16,17,19,34,39,41,60,68,108,109,115,117,142,170,171,184,185,187,205,228,236,246,251,353,564,619,644,743,756,826,866,897,953,1049,1662,2415,2431,2579,2997,3719,3827,4279,4312,6405,6555,7140],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.3982850089458962,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,3.676353282473182,2.0064197866819473,2.138507503627933,2.125691139326857,2.201553588425805,4.5594602370234405,2.2844323215331563,2.4214486257841834,2.373087554090762,2.496249838866882,2.518833027372001,2.4732161909892554,2.571852579609833,2.7742700004069256,2.617923930016232,2.673149229007135,2.6942272927333892,3.0266839340212486,3.469984576472117,7.185844525434329,3.5670958631572662,7.513620235644563,3.7636829971100436,3.8204358137024927,7.792459306144053,3.8844878351953436,4.1302590120314875,4.176068548062782,4.688631791727313,5.170884043049248,5.129498826886393,11.16683263676101,5.7446844659766265,5.719991853386255,5.7959777603641776,6.0662680901040895,6.1754673820690815,6.489124940924123,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0481646893745142E-4,2.0463497070976401E-4,2.046854966648002E-4,2.0464434833266995E-4,2.0466371549280438E-4,2.0463384241427028E-4,2.0469748638025665E-4,2.0460339623606903E-4,2.0463501395727313E-4,2.048464820698707E-4,2.0647192053234296E-4,2.0463535196139904E-4,2.048291545713374E-4,2.0485049423537834E-4,2.0475743600462684E-4,2.0464515439713884E-4,2.0471556024485936E-4,2.0481190008348797E-4,2.046557193440938E-4,2.0465497110247862E-4,2.0483908935972148E-4,2.0467547544121258E-4,2.0467578519980692E-4,2.0480690269923514E-4,2.0465579316856502E-4,2.0485294270440458E-4,2.047070074884349E-4,2.046345120803338E-4,2.0472728462307013E-4,2.0478977034141493E-4,2.0467647940754563E-4,2.047860996727675E-4,2.048866445352587E-4,2.0507681111083857E-4,2.0470665374897084E-4,2.0464503027660858E-4,2.047188163671429E-4,2.0466581389049778E-4,2.0460361461226785E-4,2.0465565596554792E-4,2.0486075590640657E-4,2.0474837688640182E-4,2.0478656634500482E-4,2.0461379771132896E-4,2.0465570800429675E-4,2.0464495332226366E-4,2.047142237835143E-4,2.0474972148578995E-4,2.0470808678692254E-4,2.0467564019349894E-4,2.0464545939350814E-4,2.0506474470589794E-4,2.0469695408604994E-4,2.046

No, its not rubbish, rubbish can be recycled into something useful. Greenhouse gas? No, its not greenhouse gas, greenhouse gases help plants grow large and healthy.<br /><br />Finally, I struck on \"Not even bad,\" a rework of the phrase \"Not even wrong\" used sometimes in theoretical physics to describe a theory that is hopelessly flawed and not even worthy of correction.

{"value":"Yet another colourful excuse for men in rubber suits to wrestle with each other. This time around, time travellers from the future arrive in 1992 and recruit a few people to go back with them to 1944 and prevent the creation of Godzilla, thus saving a future Japan from destruction. But having accomplished this task, the time travellers are revealed to be a bunch of double crossers whose own creature goes on the rampage, and with no Godzilla to stop it Eek! It all sounds very silly, and it probably is, but the plot is surprisingly decent and the final battle looks pretty good too. Unfortunately the rest of the visual effects are just rubbish rather than enjoyably rubbish, and the movie turns out to be just as dull as its predecessors.

{"value":"I too like Dafoe as an actor but i wasted a few hours of my life actually watching this film, I still cant believe i managed to watch it in its entirety. Was there actually a point to the film?, and the ending, well, Im glad i never paid to see this awful pointless piece of pathetic excuse of a film!<br /><br />Im not sure without hunting the facts out but is Dafoe married or seeing the awful actress in this film in real life, if so was it an attempt to kick start her career?, if so im afraid it must have failed..<br /><br />I post this in the hope i can actually put someone off watching this film, even if 1 person takes heed of my comments and decides they would much rather watch paint drying i will feel i have made some good in the world, if

{"value":"don't expect much from this film. In many ways this film resembles a film that Doris Day starred in in 1956,title, Julie. In this film Doris,who was a flight attendant,stewardess,in those days,landed the air craft after her derange husband,played by Louis Jordan shot the captain. She did a far better job,more convincing,than Kim Ojah,who took control of a 747 and manage to land it without much help from the control tower. I know a little about 747 aircraft,i use to be a flight attendant myself. Like i said,do not expect much from this film,it was done on a cheap budget. The producers were to cheap to use a plane with the name of a airline on it. Oceanic is one name that several movies have used.

{"value":"The premise of the film is that Thomas Archer's son was murdered and his wife was brutalized -- and he is given a chance at revenge when (after Post Traumatic Stress Disorder therapy), he is put in a room with a man strapped to a chair and told this was the culprit. He is given a large table of implements with which to offer retribution: drills, bats, nails, sledgehammers, torches, whatever you can think of that someone could possibly want to use to physically hurt another human being.<br /><br />We go way too many scenes of torture before we figure out that The Man Archer is torturing is not the man who committed the crime.

{"value":"This is even worse than the original Game of Death. A jumbled, incoherent storyline leads to \"Billy Lo\" falling from a helicopter to the ground below, killing him, as we're left to follow his younger brother, Bobby Lo. So not only do we start out following some Bruce Lee clone, the film kills that one off and has us follow another one thirty minutes into the story. The main reason to watch this one is when Bobby Lo fights a lion, which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume. Jang Lee Hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small. Mainly watched this and the original Game of Death because they're a part of the Bruce Lee boxed set. It's no wonder they're included with Lee's finished works.

{"value":"I remember I saw this cartoon when I was 6 or 7. My grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall. I remember that it really sucked. The plot had no sense. I hated the fox that became Casper's friend. He was so stupid! Casper cried his head off if he couldn't find a friend. So what? Get over it! The only good part and I don't want to sound mean-spirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end. I laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much. The bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost. I wish he had stayed dead. I think I even gave the video of this to somebody because I hated it. No wonder they were offering it for free at the mall. If you have a child don't let them watch this.

{"value":"This movie was terrible to say the least. I was hoping for a lot better after seeing \"High School Musical\". The whole entire movie was a complete rip off of \"The Simple Life\", only it wasn't a reality show.<br /><br />The acting was not good at all. Amanda Michalka had her moments, when she wasn't that terrible. On the other hand Alyson Michalka was bad all the way through. Chris Gallinger, who played the love interest of Amanda was playing a french guy, but had an awful accent. One good thing about this movie was the completely adorable Michael Trevino, who played Alyson's love interest. Just something to keep in mind, if this movie had been aired before \"High School Musical\" it probably would not have seemed as bad. But it was no comparison.<br /><br />Overall I give it a 2.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","terribl","to","sai","the","littl","i","be","hope","for","a","lot","well","after","see","high","school","music","the","whole","entir","movi","be","a","complet","rip","off","of","the","simpl","life","onli","it","be","not","a","realiti","showbr","br","the","act","be","not","good","at","all","amanda","michalka","have","her","moment","when","she","be","not","that","terribl","on","the","other","hand","alyson","michalka","be","bad","all","the","wai","through","chri","galling","who","plai","the","love","interest","of","amanda","be","plai","a","french","gui","but","have","a","aw","accent","on","good","thing","about","thi","movi","be","the","complet","ador","michael","trevino","who","plai","alyson","love","interest","just","someth","to","keep","in","mind","if","thi","movi","have","be","air","befor","high","school","music","it","probabl","would","not","have","seem","a","bad","but","it","be","no","comparisonbr","br","overal","i","give","it","a"],"filtered":["thi","movi","terribl","sai","littl","hope","lot","well","see","high","school","music","whole","entir","movi","complet","rip","simpl","life","onli","realiti","showbr","br","act","good","amanda","michalka","moment","terribl","hand","alyson","michalka","bad","wai","chri","galling","plai","love","interest","amanda","plai","french","gui","aw","accent","good","thing","thi","movi","complet","ador","michael","trevino","plai","alyson","love","interest","someth","keep","mind","thi","movi","air","befor","high","school","music","probabl","seem","bad","comparisonbr","br","overal","give"],"filtered2":["terribl","littl","hope","lot","well","see","high","school","music","whole","entir","complet","rip","simpl","life","onli","realiti","showbr","act","good","amanda","michalka","moment","terribl","hand","alyson","michalka","bad","wai","chri","galling","plai","love","interest","amanda","plai","french","gui","aw","accent","good","thing","complet","ador","michael","trevino","plai","alyson","love","interest","someth","keep","mind","air","befor","high","school","music","probabl","seem","bad","comparisonbr","overal","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,9,11,14,20,21,29,30,33,35,40,53,54,55,60,72,75,79,103,111,118,134,138,148,166,181,188,198,211,235,238,296,412,466,559,656,679,736,825,899,1140,2718,3251,3392,7523],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,9,11,14,20,21,29,30,33,35,40,53,54,55,60,72,75,79,103,111,118,134,138,148,166,181,188,198,211,235,238,296,412,466,559,656,679,736,825,899,1140,2718,3251,3392,7523],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3195384777338066,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.463169012899134,4.885490627496221,1.7003182735607676,3.6227786505458823,1.9536997889255368,3.676353282473182,1.9209463754160525,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,4.197164082437498,2.1183455303375887,4.70875905096179,2.2443961816702407,2.2907365189289424,2.3018654096236517,4.884774065938707,2.4442286541160034,2.5378812223426954,2.5439726117360975,5.137432284239405,2.6457189377809835,2.597304642813496,5.900913137266729,3.107414446935464,3.4446025032006995,3.5727776966246974,3.68099128126493,3.6715125373103863,3.6841709341823097,3.8767358583910254,4.197121957260614,4.558366596889411,5.274680836730892,5.501738287366237,11.344727608794,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852434E-4,2.0810416094933735E-4,2.0815554347424257E-4,2.0811369755170678E-4,2.0813339304459234E-4,2.0810301352577524E-4,2.0816773645214085E-4,2.080720511914943E-4,2.0810420493002436E-4,2.0831925807556946E-4,2.09972210754935E-4,2.0810454866435662E-4,2.083016368228035E-4,2.083233382595852E-4,2.0822870240647172E-4,2.0811451728144011E-4,2.0818611672416968E-4,2.0828408981847643E-4,2.0812526133664195E-4,2.0812450041003702E-4,2.083117400363144E-4,2.0814535236018638E-4,2.0814566737013872E-4,2.082790077132367E-4,2.0812533641266436E-4,2.0832582823766935E-4,2.0817741897229795E-4,2.0810369454473196E-4,2.0819803986654237E-4,2.0826158490941732E-4,2.0814637334682729E-4,2.082578520116807E-4,2.0836010141789865E-4,2.085534919000552E-4,2.081770592358653E-4,2.0811439105668624E-4,2.081894280477104E-4,2.081355270165611E-4,2.080722732698393E-4,2.0812519688363538E-4,2.083337738974034E-4,2.0821948970841417E-4,2.0825832659544344E-4,2.080826290036546E-4,2.081252498046006E-4,2.0811431279772923E-4,2.0818475760570678E-4,2.0822085710288499E-4,2.081785165682045E-4,2.0814551990552916E-4,2.0811482744843312E-4,2.0854122093255079E-4,2.0816719513391514E-4,2.0812520210255757E-4,2.0816608032148443E-4,2.0810390746310147E-4,0.9835521036690726,2.0813637514793598E-4,2.0811511961501392E-4,2.0810378867208406E-4,2.082702766950435E-4,2.0818667178510754E-4,2.0810370167923

{"value":"I was willing to go with the original _Cruel Intentions._ It went along with the plot and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. However, this movie was, in my opinion, a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices. I didn't honestly care what happened to any of them. The strongest part of the original story (Les Liasons, not CI) is the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. I wasn't clear until I read the IMDB that this movie was meant to be a prequel, especially since the title includes a number \"2,\" I expected a sequel, but then determined that it must be a companion piece. Over all, I must say that this movie read, to me at least, like a soft porn version of Les Liasons. I was not impressed.","finished_norm":["i","be","will","to","go","with","the","origin","cruel","intent","it","go","along","with","the","plot","and","stai","true","to","the","charact","of","on","of","my","favorit","stori","howev","thi","movi","be","in","my","opinion","a","crummi","rehash","with","essenti","the","same","stori","line","and","no","clear","charact","choic","i","do","not","honestli","care","what","happen","to","ani","of","them","the","strong","part","of","the","origin","stori","le","liason","not","ci","be","the","charact","and","their","interact","not","the","event","themselv","i","be","not","clear","until","i","read","the","imdb","that","thi","movi","be","mean","to","be","a","prequel","especi","sinc","the","titl","includ","a","numb","i","expect","a","sequel","but","then","determin","that","it","must","be","a","companion","piec","over","all","i","must","sai","that","thi","movi","read","to","me","at","littl","like","a","soft","porn","version","of","le","liason","i","be","not","impress"],"filtered":["go","origin","cruel","intent","go","along","plot","stai","true","charact","favorit","stori","howev","thi","movi","opinion","crummi","rehash","essenti","stori","line","clear","charact","choic","honestli","care","happen","ani","strong","part","origin","stori","le","liason","ci","charact","interact","event","themselv","clear","read","imdb","thi","movi","mean","prequel","especi","sinc","titl","includ","numb","expect","sequel","determin","must","companion","piec","must","sai","thi","movi","read","littl","like","soft","porn","version","le","liason","impress"],"filtered2":["go","origin","cruel","intent","go","along","plot","stai","true","charact","favorit","stori","howev","opinion","crummi","rehash","essenti","stori","line","clear","charact","choic","honestli","care","happen","ani","strong","part","origin","stori","le","liason","ci","charact","interact","event","themselv","clear","read","imdb","mean","prequel","especi","sinc","titl","includ","numb","expect","sequel","determin","must","companion","piec","must","read","littl","like","soft","porn","version","le","liason","impress"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,10,14,17,27,32,61,69,88,94,107,113,130,141,145,162,205,218,220,264,267,301,304,324,366,387,418,436,470,516,538,590,591,631,757,809,811,822,971,1197,1913,1984,1990,2100,2253,2522,2684,3290,5822],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,10,14,17,27,32,61,69,88,94,107,113,130,141,145,162,205,218,220,264,267,301,304,324,366,387,418,436,470,516,538,590,591,631,757,809,811,822,971,1197,1913,1984,1990,2100,2253,2522,2684,3290,5822],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.9416538289407692,3.3716610723085094,1.1175081997259209,3.83116108203179,1.3002700588679295,1.3711311285073675,1.8818517047392527,4.254065042302116,2.0317223413467334,2.08112281984698,2.1439533986393955,2.1521782565202803,2.2642139034199635,4.5315094715482385,4.69198042906518,2.3586007221245198,2.571852579609833,2.5940874818617203,2.8336934208777267,2.757740698455715,2.7085302779237206,2.8309760279012264,2.871119826396843,2.8753661172782943,3.008694896185175,3.360519385990158,3.164467636384302,3.2070272508030975,3.3814747511661465,3.442099372982581,3.43462735814388,6.9973394489419505,3.509308122676031,3.607563812710113,3.7165362186843414,3.8023521382691974,3.8425769395797067,3.813163054373413,4.181290492043933,4.240607069200353,4.848596441419991,5.014723312293965,4.956227105612356,4.933754249760298,10.518353300389853,5.501738287366237,5.243909178064138,5.521540914662417,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875928E-4,2.012795498163841E-4,2.013292472920817E-4,2.012887736734321E-4,2.0130782326822797E-4,2.012784400216689E-4,2.0134104041092706E-4,2.0124849307261752E-4,2.012795923547593E-4,2.0148759300272546E-4,2.0308633840816442E-4,2.0127992481659641E-4,2.0147054962498735E-4,2.0149153938033804E-4,2.014000070350727E-4,2.012895665207781E-4,2.013588179164925E-4,2.0145357806076937E-4,2.0129995823319925E-4,2.0129922226057965E-4,2.0148032151161326E-4,2.0131939038753929E-4,2.0131969506698974E-4,2.014486626191458E-4,2.0130003084716295E-4,2.0149394770156308E-4,2.0135040540050447E-4,2.0127909870714834E-4,2.013703500488546E-4,2.0143181118237823E-4,2.0132037789173196E-4,2.0142820070206632E-4,2.0152709691999222E-4,2.017141453144581E-4,2.013500574613432E-4,2.0128944443546508E-4,2.0136202064780038E-4,2.013098872582762E-4,2.012487078680791E-4,2.01299895893878E-4,2.015016327896794E-4,2.0139109646015118E-4,2.0142865972223043E-4,2.0125872399380602E-4,2.0129994707934203E-4,2.0128936874294856E-4,2.0135750336924311E-4,2.0139241901200334E-4,2.013514670016226E-4,2.0131955243836525E-4,2.0128986651609022E-4,2.01702276763614E-4,2.0134051684480382E-4,2.0129990094164973E-4,2.0133943859176382E-4,2.0127930464302856E-4,0.9840914994

{"value":"When I go to see a movie about zombie's, I'm not expecting oscar calibre performances, or writing on the level of The Godfather, but I do expect the actors to at least not look like their straining to read their cue cards, and dialogue that doesn't sound like it was typed out 10 minutes before the actor reads it into the camera. This movie was just awful, I actually got up and left about 25 minutes in and went next door and watched Cold Creek Manor, that wasn't very good either, but it seemed like Citizen Kane compared to this pile of crap. On the plus side, the girls were very pretty, that's probably the only thing that kept me in my seat for longer than the first 5 minutes, in fact I left after the hottest one got killed, there wasn't

{"value":"Maaan, where do i start with this god awful movie. Bad bad bad story telling. I do not know what the director was thinking when he made this movie. Namaste London was quite an enjoyable movie to be honest..even the soundtrack was good. But in this one..oh my good..for a movie which is supposed to be a musical one..the songs are soooo bad. AR Rahman should have been the music director. <br /><br />Given two great actors a much better job should have been done by the director. Even though the first half sucks, the last 30 mins of the movie are OK. Performances from Salman and Ajay save the movie from being a total disaster.<br /><br />Watch it if you have nothing better to do. The last good movie from Bollywood i watched ( and i do watch a load of them) is Dev D and Wake Up

{"value":"I remember this film, exhibit in Barcelona (Spain) in 1970, for the time of a week. Although it could seems incredible, and I can't offer any explanation for it, this movie was exhibit in a theater dedicated to... movies of art and big quality (that, is, Bergman, Resnais, Malle, Buñuel, and... The Projected Man). Few people saw it (luckly people, no doubt) and no reference about this very boring SF movie can be found in the Peter Nichols Science Fiction Encyclopidie, or about the author of the original novel. Very indicative. I remember of it, after all this years, a no-story, a lot of special effects that seems ridiculous effects in fact, and no more. It seems that in some countries the running time is 90 mm. and in anothers 77 min. Well, it means only a little more of pain.","finished_norm":["i","rememb","thi","film","exhibit","in","barcelona","spain","in","for","the","time","of","a","week","although","it","can","seem","incred","and","i","ca","not","offer","ani","explan","for","it","thi","movi","be","exhibit","in","a","theater","dedic","to","movi","of","art","and","big","qualiti","that","be","bergman","resnai","mall","buñuel","and","the","project","man","few","peopl","see","it","luckli","peopl","no","doubt","and","no","refer","about","thi","veri","bore","sf","movi","can","be","find","in","the","peter","nichol","scienc","fiction","encyclopidi","or","about","the","author","of","the","origin","novel","veri","indic","i","rememb","of","it","after","all","thi","year","a","nostori","a","lot","of","special","effect","that","seem","ridicul","effect","in","fact","and","no","much","it","seem","that","in","some","countri","the","run","time","be","mm","and","in","anoth","min","good","it","mean","onli","a","littl","much","of","pain"],"filtered":["rememb","thi","film","exhibit","barcelona","spain","time","week","although","seem","incred","ca","offer","ani","explan","thi","movi","exhibit","theater","dedic","movi","art","big","qualiti","bergman","resnai","mall","buñuel","project","man","peopl","see","luckli","peopl","doubt","refer","thi","veri","bore","sf","movi","find","peter","nichol","scienc","fiction","encyclopidi","author","origin","novel","veri","indic","rememb","thi","year","nostori","lot","special","effect","seem","ridicul","effect","fact","much","seem","countri","run","time","mm","anoth","min","good","mean","onli","littl","much","pain"],"filtered2":["rememb","exhibit","barcelona","spain","time","week","although","seem","incred","ca","offer","ani","explan","exhibit","theater","dedic","art","big","qualiti","bergman","resnai","mall","buñuel","project","man","peopl","see","luckli","peopl","doubt","refer","veri","bore","sf","find","peter","nichol","scienc","fiction","encyclopidi","author","origin","novel","veri","indic","rememb","year","nostori","lot","special","effect","seem","ridicul","effect","fact","seem","countri","run","time","mm","anoth","min","good","mean","onli","littl","pain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,11,14,15,23,27,35,38,45,57,69,72,73,81,82,88,97,106,108,137,203,237,274,290,319,382,424,458,474,507,567,608,659,715,760,857,910,916,1000,1111,1418,1419,1826,2542,2791,2870,3142,3622,4349,5467,6725],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,11,14,15,23,27,35,38,45,57,69,72,73,81,82,88,97,106,108,137,203,237,274,290,319,382,424,458,474,507,567,608,659,715,760,857,910,916,1000,1111,1418,1419,1826,2542,2791,2870,3142,3622,4349,5467,6725],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.8837873718108231,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,2.729695454751562,1.3002700588679295,4.389507038697402,1.519311641348122,1.8162961064622165,1.834162586674748,2.127032521151058,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,2.0317223413467334,2.0545557924622586,4.318168722633384,2.138507503627933,2.2939035841256437,2.569760528637609,2.640097787510554,2.748952192422636,5.7225627547931115,2.9056060024680126,3.235085203598255,3.212973749990824,3.2829611516442836,3.6466665387238555,3.365138331846453,3.454678155189441,3.616452760127359,3.6405503117064195,3.68099128126493,3.850067611308864,3.9612932464190886,4.096025840389245,4.100845126825194,4.062925891962901,4.2574141875167335,4.550761997504193,4.436351646326448,4.900964426937307,5.672363804397,5.7959777603641776,5.390512652256013,5.770002273960917,11.43998370677251,6.137727054086234,6.342521466732247,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.982080342507918E-4,1.980323920911718E-4,1.9808128781854332E-4,1.980414671436408E-4,1.980602094193923E-4,1.9803130020030465E-4,1.9809289068399731E-4,1.980018363726983E-4,1.980324339432934E-4,1.982370790049046E-4,1.998100325280433E-4,1.9803276104166448E-4,1.9822031058076083E-4,1.9824096171727865E-4,1.9815090602457095E-4,1.9804224720031637E-4,1.9811038139259512E-4,1.9820361281160006E-4,1.9805247126764244E-4,1.9805174716815737E-4,1.9822992482167867E-4,1.98071589931267E-4,1.980718896954529E-4,1.9819877666871425E-4,1.9805254271015583E-4,1.982433311860774E-4,1.9810210459216443E-4,1.9803194825949023E-4,1.9812172748195027E-4,1.9818219708903865E-4,1.9807256150447278E-4,1.9817864485507637E-4,1.98275945622206E-4,1.9845997644414833E-4,1.9810176226615827E-4,1.9804212708455398E-4,1.9811353245559533E-4,1.9806224011196326E-4,1.9800204770295567E-4,1.9805240993401503E-4,1.9825089229392215E-4,1.9814213920018057E-4,1.981790964700626E-4,1.9801190224276856E-4,1.9805246029372568E-4,1.9804205261315277E-4,1.9810908805237976E-4,1.9814344041586384E-4,1.9810314906692136E-4,1.9807174936779562E-4,1.980425423559312E-4,

{"value":"Okay, just by reading the title you would think that it would be a good movie. Well, at least I did. It started out good but became so boring after the first half hour. *spoiler*<br /><br />It tells a story about a mother that is so desperate for her daughter to become a cheerleader that she will go to any lengths to get what she wants. The only problem is that her daughter's friend is the girl in the way. She always wins the competitions, therefore pushing the mother further towards \"eliminating\" her. After talking to a \"hitman\", the mother decides that the girl needs to be roughed up a bit.

{"value":"If you haven't seen this yet, I say just move on, take a walk in the park, don't waste your time. Neither the scenario nor the acting is worth your money. *Spoilers*- I can't decide which was worse: The movie itself or Baldwin's hairstyle? Ellen Pompeo's acting talent is very questionable I hope she can improve it over time. The storyline is just unbelievable. Loose cannon American cop fighting criminals in Europe on his own?? Infamous Slavic mafiosi protected by only two hunks??? An emotional art teacher leading a ruthless gang??? Spanish police executive dumber than a sack of hammers??? Give me a break. There's only one good thing about this movie, though: At least, the production costs must be lower than \"Ocean's 12\"'s which was as meaningless and over the top as this

{"value":"The truth is that a film based on a Harold Robbins novel is not going to win any awards. This is no exception. \"The Lonely Lady\" is a pure B picture in budget, cast and execution. Technically, it looks like a made-for-tv film. The acting is very uneven. Joseph Cali is especially terrible. Anthony Holland is an embarrassment. As one reviewer said of a certain Katherine Hepburn performance, her range goes from A to B. Ms Zedora manages to get to G. The rest of the cast is solid (and wasted in their respective roles). Lloyd Bochner and Bibi Besch deserved better. Still, the whole thing can be a great deal of fun in a trashy sort of way. As befits Robbins, everything revolves around sex and nudity.

{"value":"Normally, I have no problem with a movie or story with an ending that leaves you wondering to puzzle out what really happened, when it's done on purpose...<br /><br />But this movie really feels like they got all but the last 15 minutes done, then realized they had $5 left to finish on...<br /><br />I saw it on TBS... I recommend you not spend money on it either. If you catch it on TV, watch all but the last 15 minutes, then walk away and make your own ending in your mind.<br /><br />Really, the movie would have been better if they had simply got away, and

{"value":"This movie sucked. It really was a waste of my life. The acting was atrocious, the plot completely implausible. Long, long story short, these people get \"terrorized\" by this pathetic \"crazed killer\", but completely fail to fight back in any manner. And this is after they take a raft on a camping trip, with no gear, and show up at a campsite that is already assembled and completely stocked with food and clothes and the daughters headphones. Additionally, after their boat goes missing, they panic that they're stuck in the woods, but then the daughters boyfriend just shows up and they apparently never consider that they could just hike out of the woods like he did to get to them. Like I said, this movie sucks. A complete joke. Don't let your girlfriend talk you into watching it.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","suck","it","realli","be","a","wast","of","my","life","the","act","be","atroci","the","plot","complet","implaus","long","long","stori","short","thi","peopl","get","terror","by","thi","pathet","craze","killer","but","complet","fail","to","fight","back","in","ani","manner","and","thi","be","after","thei","take","a","raft","on","a","camp","trip","with","no","gear","and","show","up","at","a","campsit","that","be","alreadi","assembl","and","complet","stock","with","food","and","cloth","and","the","daughter","headphon","addition","after","their","boat","go","miss","thei","panic","that","thei","re","stick","in","the","wood","but","then","the","daughter","boyfriend","just","show","up","and","thei","appar","never","consid","that","thei","can","just","hike","out","of","the","wood","like","he","do","to","get","to","them","like","i","sai","thi","movi","suck","a","complet","joke","do","not","let","your","girlfriend","talk","you","into","watch","it"],"filtered":["thi","movi","suck","realli","wast","life","act","atroci","plot","complet","implaus","long","long","stori","short","thi","peopl","get","terror","thi","pathet","craze","killer","complet","fail","fight","back","ani","manner","thi","thei","take","raft","camp","trip","gear","show","campsit","alreadi","assembl","complet","stock","food","cloth","daughter","headphon","addition","boat","go","miss","thei","panic","thei","re","stick","wood","daughter","boyfriend","show","thei","appar","never","consid","thei","hike","wood","like","get","like","sai","thi","movi","suck","complet","joke","let","girlfriend","talk","watch"],"filtered2":["suck","realli","wast","life","act","atroci","plot","complet","implaus","long","long","stori","short","peopl","get","terror","pathet","craze","killer","complet","fail","fight","back","ani","manner","take","raft","camp","trip","gear","show","campsit","alreadi","assembl","complet","stock","food","cloth","daughter","headphon","addition","boat","go","miss","panic","re","stick","wood","daughter","boyfriend","show","appar","never","consid","hike","wood","like","get","like","suck","complet","joke","let","girlfriend","talk","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,7,13,17,21,23,27,28,31,32,42,63,68,75,89,99,103,124,186,214,215,233,252,255,272,308,317,330,416,421,426,602,655,730,879,908,1042,1046,1050,1219,1232,1390,1448,1449,2058,2873,3356,4197,4437,4484,5810,6182],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,7,13,17,21,23,27,28,31,32,42,63,68,75,89,99,103,124,186,214,215,233,252,255,272,308,317,330,416,421,426,602,655,730,879,908,1042,1046,1050,1219,1232,1390,1448,1449,2058,2873,3356,4197,4437,4484,5810,6182],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3002700588679295,3.0904588387038183,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.6219954307453837,1.8729627573220065,2.0064197866819473,1.9742250248702675,1.9940046109572438,4.112860414513218,8.394328164874995,2.2323930368088845,2.571852579609833,2.7303758068497004,2.605934685587711,2.8377834061292515,3.0433232530252132,2.6754694156628323,2.8028805344481915,2.8753661172782943,2.8529247828056143,2.9292757465539174,3.1401446412440817,6.519555632377253,6.781862172816363,3.506637894120152,7.459562890868725,3.767137231978131,3.8962296530720266,4.081705786614497,4.115443926246347,4.067587905068712,4.240607069200353,4.246178114249808,4.364659717870332,4.456830177669989,4.566029469634981,4.679973728984199,4.9676558014359795,5.463272006538442,5.626901430320244,5.850044981634453,5.967828017290836,5.999576715605417,6.543192162194399,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.890580537347623E-4,1.8889051983545774E-4,1.8893715836395004E-4,1.8889917595156232E-4,1.889170530178958E-4,1.888894783501163E-4,1.8894822560029477E-4,1.8886137467649937E-4,1.888905597555381E-4,1.8908575768079318E-4,1.9058609813263442E-4,1.8889087175389706E-4,1.890697633461296E-4,1.8908946115349764E-4,1.8900356274854444E-4,1.888999199980761E-4,1.889649088762197E-4,1.890538364047663E-4,1.8890967208646758E-4,1.8890898141396344E-4,1.8907893375984635E-4,1.889279081652851E-4,1.889281940913011E-4,1.890492235152584E-4,1.8890974023094307E-4,1.8909172123927656E-4,1.8895701416202966E-4,1.8889009649260881E-4,1.889757311901541E-4,1.8903340930733763E-4,1.88928834887252E-4,1.8903002105699827E-4,1.891228300782368E-4,1.8929836538968437E-4,1.8895668763899688E-4,1.8889980542728007E-4,1.8896791447506068E-4,1.8891898996655006E-4,1.8886157625100822E-4,1.889096135842163E-4,1.890989332997695E-4,1.8899520063162548E-4,1.8903045182384713E-4,1.8887097587057722E-4,1.8890966161914545E-4,1.8889973439374086E-4,1.8896367524114097E-4,1.889964417786128E-4,1.8895801042

I watched it with a kind of fatalistic fascination to see if it could continue to deteriorate and it did. By the end of this mess I was sorry any of the characters survived and I wasn't feeling too charitable about the actors either.If you want to watch a train wreck, I recommend hanging out at a train station. Even waiting on a deserted train platform beats this mess. Apparently I haven't vented enough to fill up my prescribed ten lines so, at the risk of redundancy, I will say it one more time. This movie is a zero and it would be less if I had a word for an even lower rating. How about minus zero?","finished_norm":["thi","mai","actual","be","the","wrong","movi","that","i","have","ever","scene","incoher","would","be","a","complim","even","the","end","make","no","sens","but","it","be","a","tremend","relief","that","it","be","final","over","i","watch","it","with","a","kind","of","fatalist","fascin","to","see","if","it","can","continu","to","deterior","and","it","do","by","the","end","of","thi","mess","i","be","sorri","ani","of","the","charact","surviv","and","i","be","not","feel","too","charit","about","the","actor","eitherif","you","want","to","watch","a","train","wreck","i","recommend","hang","out","at","a","train","station","even","wait","on","a","desert","train","platform","beat","thi","mess","appar","i","have","not","vent","enough","to","fill","up","my","prescrib","ten","line","so","at","the","risk","of","redund","i","will","sai","it","on","much","time","thi","movi","be","a","zero","and","it","would","be","littl","if","i","have","a","word","for","a","even","low","rate","how","about","minu","zero"],"filtered":["thi","mai","actual","wrong","movi","ever","scene","incoher","complim","even","end","make","sens","tremend","relief","final","watch","kind","fatalist","fascin","see","continu","deterior","end","thi","mess","sorri","ani","charact","surviv","feel","charit","actor","eitherif","want","watch","train","wreck","recommend","hang","train","station","even","wait","desert","train","platform","beat","thi","mess","appar","vent","enough","fill","prescrib","ten","line","risk","redund","sai","much","time","thi","movi","zero","littl","word","even","low","rate","minu","zero"],"filtered2":["mai","actual","wrong","ever","scene","incoher","complim","even","end","make","sens","tremend","relief","final","watch","kind","fatalist","fascin","see","continu","deterior","end","mess","sorri","ani","charact","surviv","feel","charit","actor","eitherif","want","watch","train","wreck","recommend","hang","train","station","even","wait","desert","train","platform","beat","mess","appar","vent","enough","fill","prescrib","ten","line","risk","redund","time","zero","littl","word","even","low","rate","minu","zero"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,8,10,14,19,24,25,27,37,41,43,44,46,52,93,107,122,156,173,202,217,258,298,308,331,407,433,437,545,553,678,713,848,886,964,1187,1257,1258,1538,1754,1897,1927,3227,3299,3700,4326,4409,4530,6770,7084],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,7,8,10,14,19,24,25,27,37,41,43,44,46,52,93,107,122,156,173,202,217,258,298,308,331,407,433,437,545,553,678,713,848,886,964,1187,1257,1258,1538,1754,1897,1927,3227,3299,3700,4326,4409,4530,6770,7084],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,2.7780513171783934,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.312380678011735,2.6420723132238515,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.7122153074726136,2.035389827120098,2.1439533986393955,2.2489347673732487,2.3451551414151686,2.4368824319140248,2.597304642813496,2.6113665294700725,2.7061321952397077,2.7819920465008363,2.8753661172782943,2.932274249550174,6.240031747626936,3.164467636384302,3.1952392950510555,3.442099372982581,3.454678155189441,3.6715125373103863,11.595658248988398,3.827761853794566,3.9782428047328615,8.125851783925802,4.436351646326448,4.34596758485818,4.390138803171316,4.550761997504193,4.751432692966343,4.848596441419991,4.848596441419991,5.541743621979936,5.541743621979936,5.695894301807195,5.9370563586240825,5.9370563586240825,6.137727054086234,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.982080342507919E-4,1.980323920911719E-4,1.9808128781854343E-4,1.9804146714364092E-4,1.980602094193924E-4,1.980313002003048E-4,1.9809289068399745E-4,1.980018363726984E-4,1.9803243394329352E-4,1.982370790049047E-4,1.9981003252786652E-4,1.9803276104166461E-4,1.9822031058076093E-4,1.9824096171727876E-4,1.9815090602457106E-4,1.9804224720031648E-4,1.9811038139259525E-4,1.9820361281160017E-4,1.9805247126764255E-4,1.9805174716815748E-4,1.9822992482167878E-4,1.980715899312671E-4,1.9807188969545302E-4,1.9819877666871436E-4,1.9805254271015594E-4,1.9824333118607752E-4,1.9810210459216454E-4,1.9803194825949037E-4,1.9812172748195038E-4,1.9818219708903875E-4,1.9807256150447292E-4,1.9817864485507648E-4,1.9827594562220612E-4,1.9845997644414847E-4,1.981017622661584E-4,1.980421270845541E-4,1.9811353245559546E-4,1.9806224011196337E-4,1.9800204770295578E-4,1.9805240993401514E-4,1.9825089229392226E-4,1.9814213920018068E-4,1.9817909647006272E-4,1.9801190224276867E-4,1.980524602937258E-4,1.9804205261315287E-4,1.9810908805237986E-4,1.9814344041586398E-4,1.9810314906692147E-4,1.9807174936779576E-4,1.980425423559313E-4

{"value":"After watching this, I had lost a little respect for Christopher Lee (This has passed over time). This film was utter garbage. First, they tried to recreate the ending from the first \"Howling,\" with incredibly bad make-up. Then they try to turn it into a sad excuse of a werewolf porn film! The plot sucks and the whole film is just AWFUL!!!! A brother of a werewolf victim from the first film (From the look of it, it was SUPPOSED to be Dee Wallace Stone)teams up with Lee and another woman to destroy the group of werewolves, lead by Sybil Danning, who seems to be naked all the time.<br /><br />This is not even worth renting (Unless you want to waste your time and money watching the nudity.).

{"value":"When Stanwyck's husband-to-be is murdered on the eve of their wedding, she retreats to a mountain lodge, where she slips (sort of) off a cliff and is rescued by wealthy attorney Morgan. Morgan falls in love with her, leading to a definitely one-sided marriage, spent on a huge estate in Chicago (which appears to be surrounded by mountains!). Stanwyck is tempted by dashing Cortez, but eventually returns to Morgan, in a very subdued and unconvincing story resolution.<br /><br />This film has a great cast (Morgan in particular is one of my favorites) and a great director, but the script is meandering and seems pointless at times. I was so ready to enjoy this movie but I was ultimately disappointed.

{"value":"This series just gets worse and worse. Poorly written and just plain not funny! The premise is excellent, but the writer's inexperience shines through. By trying so hard to offend no one they end up insulting everyone. Now into the second season the desperate cast have stopped waving their arms about, and resorted to that patronizing, smug, \"Oh, silly you\" style acting that comes with a no laugh script. They roll their eyes and shake their heads at each other as if to say, aren't we zany? Isn't this funny? Well, no, it's not actually. Gum disease is less painful. No wonder, with the exception of Corner Gas, Canadians generally avoid Canadian TV. Come on CBC you're suppose to be our leading station showcasing the best of Canadian talent.

{"value":"Merry madcaps in London stage a treasure hunt, with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong, independent lady-flier who's never been in love. Intriguing early vehicle for Katharine Hepburn, playing an Amelia Earhart-like aviatrix who's been too self-involved to give herself over to any man. The director (Dorothy Arzner) and the screenwriter (Zoe Akins, who adapted Gilbert Frankau's book) were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view, but why are all the old clichés kept intact like frozen artifacts? Billie Burke plays the type of simpering, weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong, and Hepburn's final scene is another bummer.

{"value":"This movie has got to be one of the worst I have ever seen make it to DVD!!! The story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that I highly caution parents on.... But the story line is like a loose cannon. If there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker-this one would have sprung from that.It reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960's, poor script writing and filming. <br /><br />The only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver. The rest of the film, could have easily been made by middle school children. I give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated.

{"value":"Sorry Fulci fans, but I could not get through this one. The soundtrack was about as annoying as they come, the acting was puerile, the story has been done and done, and the direction was non-existent. <br /><br />Massacre honestly looked like a children's film project. But I've seen some of those, and they actually look better than this did! It appears to have been so underfunded they couldn't afford ... ANYTHING! Not a DoP, not a director, no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was. It was a very poor cinematic experience; one of my worst.<br /><br />This was about the worst suck-fest I've seen, next to Terror Toons which is second only to Killer Klowns from Outer Space.

{"value":"I actually liked this movie until the end. Sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. Until the end, that is. For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students, what does the main character do? Wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition? No. She tortures and butchers the great sensuous Habanera from Carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable Brittany Spears-wannabe pop song. My ears bled! And, in the supreme moment of horror, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher not in a Spears-induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot. Save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!","finished_norm":["i","actual","like","thi","movi","until","the","end","sure","it","be","cheesi","and","pretti","unlik","but","still","it","keep","my","attent","on","a","raini","afternoon","until","the","end","that","be","for","her","final","perform","at","the","prestigi","classic","conservatori","where","she","have","struggl","to","catchup","to","the","other","classic","train","student","what","doe","the","main","charact","do","wow","them","with","her","grasp","and","execut","of","thi","time","honor","music","tradit","no","she","tortur","and","butcher","the","great","sensuou","habanera","from","carmen","and","turn","it","into","a","utterli","forgett","brittani","spearswannab","pop","song","my","ear","ble","and","in","the","suprem","moment","of","horror","her","teacher","give","her","a","stand","ovat","ani","teacher","not","in","a","spearsinduc","fantasi","would","have","fail","her","on","the","spot","save","your","time","save","your","ear","skip","thi","movi"],"filtered":["actual","like","thi","movi","end","sure","cheesi","pretti","unlik","still","keep","attent","raini","afternoon","end","final","perform","prestigi","classic","conservatori","struggl","catchup","classic","train","student","doe","main","charact","wow","grasp","execut","thi","time","honor","music","tradit","tortur","butcher","great","sensuou","habanera","carmen","turn","utterli","forgett","brittani","spearswannab","pop","song","ear","ble","suprem","moment","horror","teacher","give","stand","ovat","ani","teacher","spearsinduc","fantasi","fail","spot","save","time","save","ear","skip","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["actual","like","end","sure","cheesi","pretti","unlik","still","keep","attent","raini","afternoon","end","final","perform","prestigi","classic","conservatori","struggl","catchup","classic","train","student","doe","main","charact","wow","grasp","execut","time","honor","music","tradit","tortur","butcher","great","sensuou","habanera","carmen","turn","utterli","forgett","brittani","spearswannab","pop","song","ear","ble","suprem","moment","horror","teacher","give","stand","ovat","ani","teacher","spearsinduc","fantasi","fail","spot","save","time","save","ear","skip"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,8,10,18,24,27,30,51,52,64,78,83,96,105,118,119,134,156,179,188,189,215,328,332,377,543,615,626,636,662,713,802,816,842,931,952,996,1003,1005,1114,1391,1450,1788,2050,2345,2354,2622,3038,4335,5325,6241,6947,8561],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,8,10,18,24,27,30,51,52,64,78,83,96,105,118,119,134,156,179,188,189,215,328,332,377,543,615,626,636,662,713,802,816,842,931,952,996,1003,1005,1114,1391,1450,1788,2050,2345,2354,2622,3038,4335,5325,6241,6947,8561],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028365,1.2153159934048174,2.6420723132238515,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,1.883428577602134,2.0064197866819473,2.292318797740072,2.0390708128715254,2.1765612129984904,2.354379525480895,2.1653408989309972,2.2443961816702407,2.3451551414151686,2.507968722980095,2.5378812223426954,4.996386948150906,2.605934685587711,3.1550424959247185,5.941068926339787,3.0602441305135506,3.477726550625732,3.5013187326425523,3.6528204042982337,3.530930586689197,3.616452760127359,3.865219416329466,3.8883864756110005,3.7881170224473255,3.8883864756110005,3.9241755834625858,3.9868265484242533,4.1302590120314875,4.035401218572811,4.062925891962901,8.729319435740663,4.429617614145104,4.484804029712395,9.597669863721855,5.02684467282631,5.051537285416681,5.2288713006995975,5.339219357868463,5.408212229355414,5.9370563586240825,6.214688095222362,6.725513718988353,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0481646893745142E-4,2.0463497070976404E-4,2.0468549666480024E-4,2.0464434833266997E-4,2.046637154928044E-4,2.046338424142703E-4,2.0469748638025668E-4,2.0460339623606905E-4,2.0463501395727316E-4,2.0484648206987074E-4,2.0647187928241826E-4,2.0463535196139907E-4,2.0482915457133743E-4,2.0485049423537836E-4,2.0475743600462687E-4,2.0464515439713886E-4,2.0471556024485936E-4,2.04811900083488E-4,2.0465571934409382E-4,2.0465497110247865E-4,2.048390893597215E-4,2.046754754412126E-4,2.0467578519980695E-4,2.0480690269923516E-4,2.0465579316856505E-4,2.048529427044046E-4,2.047070074884349E-4,2.0463451208033382E-4,2.0472728462307016E-4,2.0478977034141496E-4,2.0467647940754566E-4,2.0478609967276753E-4,2.0488664453525873E-4,2.0507681111083857E-4,2.0470665374897087E-4,2.046450302766086E-4,2.0471881636714291E-4,2.046658138904978E-4,2.0460361461226788E-4,2.0465565596554795E-4,2.048607559064066E-4,2.0474837688640182E-4,2.0478656634500484E-4,2.04613797711329E-4,2.0465570800429678E-4,2.046449533222637E-4,2.0471422378351433E-4,2.0474972148578998E-4,2.047

{"value":"I had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on Danish television yesterday. First of all, I wanted to see Gina Lollobrigida - and here I wasn't disappointed. She looked gorgeous. Second of all, through reading about the film I had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in Philippe de Broca's films. On this account, however, I was sadly disappointed. I found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war) and the characters completely one-dimensional. Also, the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion, with no sense of drama at all.

{"value":"I can always tell when something is going to be a hit. I see it or hear it, and get a good feeling. I did not get a good feeling watching the preview. I was not at all enthusiastic about this film, and I am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films. I was in fact proved right.<br /><br />The first thing that threw me off was the title. Not that I have a problem with ebonics(I am black by the way), but for a movie they could have used a better title, and for this time use a title that doesn't have bad grammar. I heard the dialog, saw the acting and all I could do was make faces.<br /><br />I also think that the dance movie theme is being overdone. At least \"You Got Served\" was better than this in my opinion. Even the soundtrack didn't thrill me.","finished_norm":["i","can","alwai","tell","when","someth","be","go","to","be","a","hit","i","see","it","or","hear","it","and","get","a","good","feel","i","do","not","get","a","good","feel","watch","the","preview","i","be","not","at","all","enthusiast","about","thi","film","and","i","be","not","at","all","surpris","that","it","be","rate","here","a","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","be","in","fact","prove","rightbr","br","the","thing","that","throw","me","off","be","the","titl","not","that","i","have","a","problem","with","ebonicsi","be","black","by","the","wai","but","for","a","movi","thei","can","have","us","a","well","titl","and","for","thi","time","us","a","titl","that","doe","not","have","bad","grammar","i","hear","the","dialog","see","the","act","and","all","i","can","do","be","make","facesbr","br","i","conjur","think","that","the","danc","movi","theme","be","be","overdo","at","littl","you","get","serv","be","well","than","thi","in","my","opinion","even","the","soundtrack","do","not","thrill","me"],"filtered":["alwai","tell","someth","go","hit","see","hear","get","good","feel","get","good","feel","watch","preview","enthusiast","thi","film","surpris","rate","wrong","film","fact","prove","rightbr","br","thing","throw","titl","problem","ebonicsi","black","wai","movi","thei","us","well","titl","thi","time","us","titl","doe","bad","grammar","hear","dialog","see","act","make","facesbr","br","conjur","think","danc","movi","theme","overdo","littl","get","serv","well","thi","opinion","even","soundtrack","thrill"],"filtered2":["alwai","tell","someth","go","hit","see","hear","get","good","feel","get","good","feel","watch","preview","enthusiast","surpris","rate","wrong","fact","prove","rightbr","thing","throw","titl","problem","ebonicsi","black","wai","us","well","titl","time","us","titl","doe","bad","grammar","hear","dialog","see","act","make","facesbr","conjur","think","danc","theme","overdo","littl","get","serv","well","opinion","even","soundtrack","thrill"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,14,18,20,21,25,29,33,39,43,53,56,90,97,167,197,202,216,229,264,310,326,388,432,492,534,538,540,796,815,1218,1974,1977,3057,4628,7518],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,14,18,20,21,25,29,33,39,43,53,56,90,97,167,197,202,216,229,264,310,326,388,432,492,534,538,540,796,815,1218,1974,1977,3057,4628,7518],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,2.389902141215977,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.5538940054862738,3.321622407243643,1.7003182735607676,3.7221218701403576,2.0477128419653545,2.0545557924622586,2.4609576687888097,2.558331832813986,2.597304642813496,5.2140373930679385,2.8432628718938773,8.273222095367146,2.854312708080462,2.942840385588056,3.0914425013694116,3.235085203598255,3.6016814428070463,3.4933926673701317,3.43462735814388,3.432149042129413,3.850067611308864,3.7881170224473255,4.297765483040301,4.9909126636002465,4.900964426937307,5.426230734858092,5.999576715605417,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.194497759780537E-4,2.1925531043720615E-4,2.193094462670605E-4,2.1926535805328207E-4,2.1928610891855615E-4,2.1925410152956982E-4,2.1932229259911867E-4,2.1922148009526665E-4,2.1925535677457458E-4,2.19481933427208E-4,2.2122345868647725E-4,2.192557189277261E-4,2.1946336794909422E-4,2.1948623224568876E-4,2.1938652538130784E-4,2.192662217077921E-4,2.193416577681341E-4,2.1944488069798197E-4,2.1927754147741077E-4,2.1927673977696315E-4,2.1947401253786478E-4,2.1929870906764123E-4,2.1929904095723237E-4,2.1943952627086755E-4,2.1927762057634143E-4,2.1948885564790875E-4,2.1933249395190844E-4,2.1925481904056093E-4,2.1935421980567526E-4,2.1942116987548035E-4,2.1929978476330192E-4,2.1941723695242712E-4,2.1952496533805894E-4,2.1972871854514237E-4,2.1933211493919258E-4,2.1926608871935272E-4,2.1934514652716502E-4,2.192883572382646E-4,2.1922171407356029E-4,2.1927747357072453E-4,2.1949722707154427E-4,2.1937681902578203E-4,2.1941773696650542E-4,2.1923262471379987E-4,2.1927752932743115E-4,2.1926600626693158E-4,2.193402258220397E-4,2.1937825969134978E-4,2.1933365036190102E-4,2.1929888559081107E-4,2.192665484949165E-4,2.19715790044447E-4,2.193217222746471E-4,2.1927747906929984E-4,2.1932054772559218E-4,2.192550433680467E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630287E-4,2.1926685631708636E-4,2.1925491821167653E-4,2.1943032740576242E-4,2.1934224257171367E-4,2.1925482655736373E-4,2.1923253539347115E-4,2.192104891403559E-4,2.1940869012321312E-4,2.1926556769286503E-4,2.1936523766456585E-4,2.1942961580067317E-4,2.1933006485397506E-4,2.192

{"value":"This movie was based on actual fact? I sincerely hope not!<br /><br />We get to see what appears to be numerous armed cops empty an equal amount of guns at 2 guys who only got armored torso's. That's a great idea; aim for the armor!...excuse me, but how about those big fat unmissable heads or their legs for crying out loud. Or were there invisible tanks protecting them? were they from Crypton?Did i miss something here?<br /><br />This movie started out decent enough but after 20 minutes of shoot-out it really takes a

{"value":"To be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence, but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the CGI was a little old hat now. maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too.. To say this was awful is to do this film a mis-service, if you want to see something that is totally execrable, you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching 'sickle', that is soo mind numbingly awful, its actually good,(several large alcoholic beverages are deriguer though. Any road up, I enjoyed this film and its gotta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet, just don't expect anything along the lines of 'jurassic park,the lost world' or

{"value":"I noticed that this film has taken the brunt of a lot of insults. It probably earned some of them, but it wasn't that bad. Well, I'll be honest: I never want to see this film again. It was a bad film. But I don't hate this film, it tried to tell a story. As a drama, this film could work very well actually. I just think the filmmakers misgauged which road to take when they made this (they should have added more funny bits if they wanted it to be a comedy). With a rewrite, it could have been a great film. But as a satire, it didn't work in its current form -- many scenes did not fit within the context of the plot: for example, the robbery scene makes little sense in the story. Still, it wasn't the worst independent film ever made -- is it in the Top 10 Worst? That's debatable.","finished_norm":["i","notic","that","thi","film","have","take","the","brunt","of","a","lot","of","insult","it","probabl","earn","some","of","them","but","it","be","not","that","bad","good","i","will","be","honest","i","never","want","to","see","thi","film","again","it","be","a","bad","film","but","i","do","not","hate","thi","film","it","try","to","tell","a","stori","a","a","drama","thi","film","can","work","veri","good","actual","i","just","think","the","filmmak","misgaug","which","road","to","take","when","thei","make","thi","thei","should","have","add","much","funni","bit","if","thei","want","it","to","be","a","comedi","with","a","rewrit","it","can","have","be","a","great","film","but","a","a","satir","it","do","not","work","in","it","current","form","mani","scene","do","not","fit","within","the","context","of","the","plot","for","exampl","the","robberi","scene","make","littl","sens","in","the","stori","still","it","be","not","the","wrong","independ","film","ever","make","be","it","in","the","top","wrong","that","debat"],"filtered":["notic","thi","film","take","brunt","lot","insult","probabl","earn","bad","good","honest","never","want","see","thi","film","bad","film","hate","thi","film","try","tell","stori","drama","thi","film","work","veri","good","actual","think","filmmak","misgaug","road","take","thei","make","thi","thei","add","much","funni","bit","thei","want","comedi","rewrit","great","film","satir","work","current","form","mani","scene","fit","within","context","plot","exampl","robberi","scene","make","littl","sens","stori","still","wrong","independ","film","ever","make","top","wrong","debat"],"filtered2":["notic","take","brunt","lot","insult","probabl","earn","bad","good","honest","never","want","see","bad","hate","try","tell","stori","drama","work","veri","good","actual","think","filmmak","misgaug","road","take","make","add","funni","bit","want","comedi","rewrit","great","satir","work","current","form","mani","scene","fit","within","context","plot","exampl","robberi","scene","make","littl","sens","stori","still","wrong","independ","ever","make","top","wrong","debat"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,9,12,14,15,17,19,25,31,32,36,37,42,44,48,50,51,52,62,64,72,90,127,148,173,299,307,323,339,364,463,672,676,688,689,709,1080,1102,1211,1278,1360,1382,1470,2045,2449,2656,3037],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,9,12,14,15,17,19,25,31,32,36,37,42,44,48,50,51,52,62,64,72,90,127,148,173,299,307,323,339,364,463,672,676,688,689,709,1080,1102,1211,1278,1360,1382,1470,2045,2449,2656,3037],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,2.1367141713444147,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,2.62476135602347,2.559277576165403,2.814133962290301,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,2.975308642954861,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,3.3910232448024944,1.717994385570355,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,2.0226120445069267,1.883428577602134,1.9209463754160525,2.0477128419653545,2.4359679371086367,2.3018654096236517,2.4368824319140248,2.7949961309240425,2.8767855639325206,3.0433232530252132,3.003844442051426,2.9878441007049847,3.3467891931782563,3.616452760127359,3.6105180246075443,3.6016814428070463,3.607563812710113,3.6497387377608255,4.229557233013768,4.160564361526816,4.364659717870332,4.535724120139652,4.403125998698128,4.449957298382227,4.550761997504193,4.911775343041523,5.1994574154933035,5.290429193699031,5.672363804397]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.048164689374515E-4,2.0463497070976412E-4,2.0468549666480032E-4,2.0464434833267003E-4,2.046637154928045E-4,2.0463384241427038E-4,2.0469748638025673E-4,2.0460339623606914E-4,2.0463501395727324E-4,2.0484648206987082E-4,2.0647187928241834E-4,2.0463535196139912E-4,2.048291545713375E-4,2.0485049423537842E-4,2.0475743600462695E-4,2.0464515439713894E-4,2.0471556024485944E-4,2.0481190008348808E-4,2.046557193440939E-4,2.046549711024787E-4,2.048390893597216E-4,2.046754754412127E-4,2.0467578519980703E-4,2.0480690269923524E-4,2.0465579316856513E-4,2.048529427044047E-4,2.04707007488435E-4,2.046345120803339E-4,2.047272846230702E-4,2.0478977034141504E-4,2.0467647940754574E-4,2.047860996727676E-4,2.048866445352588E-4,2.0507681111083865E-4,2.0470665374897095E-4,2.0464503027660868E-4,2.04718816367143E-4,2.046658138904979E-4,2.0460361461226796E-4,2.04655655965548E-4,2.0486075590640666E-4,2.047483768864019E-4,2.0478656634500492E-4,2.0461379771132904E-4,2.0465570800429686E-4,2.0464495332226374E-4,2.0471422378351442E-4,2.0474972148579003E-4,2.0470808678692265E-4,2.0467564019349904E-4,2.0464545939350825E-4,2.0506474470589802E-4,2.0469695408605003E-4,2.046556610974684E-4,2.0469585785804547E-4,2.0463472144925814E-4,0.9838262975206153,2.0466664788314017E-4,2.046

{"value":"Animal Farm (1954) was a very good read about the dangers of totalitarianism. How good ideals can be changed and distorted by those who are ignorant or rule with an iron fist and an empty head. Sadly this movie does not portray either of these. What we're shown is a propaganda piece with a lot of finger waving and pointing. The animation and the direction were good considering the budget and the time period but the very essence of George Orwell's novel is sorely missing.<br /><br />If you're one of those who want to see how not to adapt a novel or are just interested in seeing an adaptation of this brilliant novelette then by all means watch. I just found this one to be somewhat mediocre. Just one man's opinion however.<br /><br />The remake is a notch below but not by much.","finished_norm":["anim","farm","be","a","veri","good","read","about","the","danger","of","totalitarian","how","good","ideal","can","be","chang","and","distort","by","that","who","be","ignor","or","rule","with","a","iron","fist","and","a","empti","head","sadli","thi","movi","doe","not","portrai","either","of","thi","what","we","re","show","be","a","propaganda","piec","with","a","lot","of","finger","wave","and","point","the","anim","and","the","direct","be","good","consid","the","budget","and","the","time","period","but","the","veri","essenc","of","georg","orwel","novel","be","sore","missingbr","br","if","you","re","on","of","that","who","want","to","see","how","not","to","adapt","a","novel","or","be","just","interest","in","see","a","adapt","of","thi","brilliant","novelett","then","by","all","mean","watch","i","just","find","thi","on","to","be","somewhat","mediocr","just","on","man","opinion","howeverbr","br","the","remak","be","a","notch","below","but","not","by","much"],"filtered":["anim","farm","veri","good","read","danger","totalitarian","good","ideal","chang","distort","ignor","rule","iron","fist","empti","head","sadli","thi","movi","doe","portrai","either","thi","re","show","propaganda","piec","lot","finger","wave","point","anim","direct","good","consid","budget","time","period","veri","essenc","georg","orwel","novel","sore","missingbr","br","re","want","see","adapt","novel","interest","see","adapt","thi","brilliant","novelett","mean","watch","find","thi","somewhat","mediocr","man","opinion","howeverbr","br","remak","notch","much"],"filtered2":["anim","farm","veri","good","read","danger","totalitarian","good","ideal","chang","distort","ignor","rule","iron","fist","empti","head","sadli","doe","portrai","either","re","show","propaganda","piec","lot","finger","wave","point","anim","direct","good","consid","budget","time","period","veri","essenc","georg","orwel","novel","sore","missingbr","re","want","see","adapt","novel","interest","see","adapt","brilliant","novelett","mean","watch","find","somewhat","mediocr","man","opinion","howeverbr","remak","notch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,8,15,18,28,37,38,45,60,66,68,72,88,102,145,207,208,218,256,277,278,317,469,474,483,538,596,680,701,706,743,762,787,912,978,1144,1246,1289,1657,1804,1905,2573,2750,2853,2971,3439,3874,4079,5917],"values":[2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,8,15,18,28,37,38,45,60,66,68,72,88,102,145,207,208,218,256,277,278,317,469,474,483,538,596,680,701,706,743,762,787,912,978,1144,1246,1289,1657,1804,1905,2573,2750,2853,2971,3439,3874,4079,5917],"values":[1.3114004109387893,2.0358433949768115,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,2.4001215597131385,1.2153159934048174,1.5452294193519092,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.8162961064622165,1.838176641236591,1.929723173391612,4.012839573363895,1.9209463754160525,2.0317223413467334,2.087553710177271,2.34599021453259,2.5531798379045583,2.6289494000279396,2.5940874818617203,2.748952192422636,6.232798466686559,2.8336934208777267,2.8529247828056143,3.328770687675578,7.293333077447711,3.613480989738201,3.43462735814388,3.485528930909917,3.8095464139032247,7.648184249811207,3.6284289511740746,3.7568101178222815,3.7465885637507435,3.760240652919071,3.9405024767500145,4.058285512406398,4.229557233013768,4.315570107673808,4.443131333311827,4.798834931860927,4.869215728622727,4.85885294158718,5.185068678041204,5.373120909544144,5.444579873526289,5.463272006538442,5.770002273960917,5.7446844659766265,5.822646007446338,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.048164689374516E-4,2.0463497070976423E-4,2.046854966648004E-4,2.0464434833267014E-4,2.0466371549280457E-4,2.0463384241427047E-4,2.0469748638025684E-4,2.0460339623606922E-4,2.0463501395727332E-4,2.048464820698709E-4,2.0647187928241845E-4,2.0463535196139923E-4,2.048291545713376E-4,2.0485049423537853E-4,2.0475743600462703E-4,2.0464515439713903E-4,2.0471556024485955E-4,2.0481190008348816E-4,2.04655719344094E-4,2.046549711024788E-4,2.0483908935972167E-4,2.0467547544121277E-4,2.046757851998071E-4,2.0480690269923535E-4,2.0465579316856524E-4,2.048529427044048E-4,2.047070074884351E-4,2.0463451208033398E-4,2.0472728462307032E-4,2.0478977034141512E-4,2.0467647940754582E-4,2.047860996727677E-4,2.048866445352589E-4,2.0507681111083876E-4,2.0470665374897106E-4,2.0464503027660877E-4,2.0471881636714308E-4,2.0466581389049797E-4,2.0460361461226804E-4,2.046556559655481E-4,2.0486075590640676E-4,2.04748376886402E-4,2.0478656634500503E-4,2.0461379771132915E-4,2.0465570800429694E-4,2.0464495332226385E-4,2.047142237835145E-4,2.0474972148579014E-4,2.0470808678692273E-4,2.0467564019349913E-4,2.0464545939350833E-4,2.0506474470589813E-4,2.0469695408605013E-4,2.046556610974685E-4,2.0469585785804555E-4,2.046347214
