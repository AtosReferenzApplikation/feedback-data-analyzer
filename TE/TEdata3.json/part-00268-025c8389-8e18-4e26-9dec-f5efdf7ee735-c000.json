{"value":"I saw one of the stage performances in Denver and have never been less impressed. The word \"vagina\" says it all. A body part. Nothing shocking here. I could say to my doctor, \"My left arm has been hurting a bit after tennis\" or \"My vagina hurts after cycling\" with equal or more social commentary. It could be the \"Tricep Monologues\" for all the entertainment or radical comment I heard. The monologues were dull but delivered with drama, the topics were outdated, and I was alternately bored and annoyed. Once I think I laughed but apparently it wasn't when I was supposed to. Surely this isn't really a hit. Oh, and spoilers: there was a LESBIAN! - oh, wait, maybe not, come to think of it. And Inappropriate Fondling! And a Crack Mama! That about covers it.","finished_norm":["i","see","on","of","the","stage","perform","in","denver","and","have","never","be","littl","impress","the","word","vagina","sai","it","all","a","bodi","part","noth","shock","here","i","can","sai","to","my","doctor","my","leav","arm","have","be","hurt","a","bite","after","tenni","or","my","vagina","hurt","after","cycl","with","equal","or","much","social","commentari","it","can","be","the","tricep","monologu","for","all","the","entertain","or","radic","comment","i","hear","the","monologu","be","dull","but","deliv","with","drama","the","topic","be","outdat","and","i","be","altern","bore","and","annoi","onc","i","think","i","laugh","but","appar","it","be","not","when","i","be","suppos","to","sure","thi","be","not","realli","a","hit","oh","and","spoiler","there","be","a","lesbian","oh","wait","mayb","not","come","to","think","of","it","and","inappropri","fondl","and","a","crack","mama","that","about","cover","it"],"filtered":["see","stage","perform","denver","never","littl","impress","word","vagina","sai","bodi","part","noth","shock","sai","doctor","leav","arm","hurt","bite","tenni","vagina","hurt","cycl","equal","much","social","commentari","tricep","monologu","entertain","radic","comment","hear","monologu","dull","deliv","drama","topic","outdat","altern","bore","annoi","onc","think","laugh","appar","suppos","sure","thi","realli","hit","oh","spoiler","lesbian","oh","wait","mayb","come","think","inappropri","fondl","crack","mama","cover"],"filtered2":["see","stage","perform","denver","never","littl","impress","word","vagina","bodi","part","noth","shock","doctor","leav","arm","hurt","bite","tenni","vagina","hurt","cycl","equal","social","commentari","tricep","monologu","entertain","radic","comment","hear","monologu","dull","deliv","drama","topic","outdat","altern","bore","annoi","onc","think","laugh","appar","suppos","sure","realli","hit","oh","spoiler","lesbian","oh","wait","mayb","come","think","inappropri","fondl","crack","mama","cover"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,12,13,14,34,42,49,61,74,105,108,119,133,149,154,163,195,216,234,236,258,271,280,308,331,367,376,388,418,463,490,491,508,517,669,692,863,906,975,992,1239,1457,1786,1883,1925,2328,3189,3385,4078,4415,5603,7544,7738,7769],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,12,13,14,34,42,49,61,74,105,108,119,133,149,154,163,195,216,234,236,258,271,280,308,331,367,376,388,418,463,490,491,508,517,669,692,863,906,975,992,1239,1457,1786,1883,1925,2328,3189,3385,4078,4415,5603,7544,7738,7769],"values":[0.6557002054693947,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.3982850089458962,1.6219954307453837,1.6920303308087352,1.8818517047392527,1.9486336368009016,2.1765612129984904,2.138507503627933,2.1653408989309972,2.3212364753796515,2.3253197803590226,2.348499626138016,2.4000574358028657,2.51289241584188,2.6070186965339692,5.34629845801427,2.617923930016232,2.7061321952397077,2.757740698455715,2.8028805344481915,2.8753661172782943,2.932274249550174,3.0791938792932125,3.1569204307489187,3.0914425013694116,3.164467636384302,3.3467891931782563,3.3490645070153917,3.369778711402955,3.4149707055943286,3.4198487640477615,3.7099788181381825,3.8463152616903136,7.889252387867754,3.9081109809587793,4.086456389373095,4.091229668125752,4.573751515728891,4.597282013139085,4.798834931860927,4.848596441419991,4.828393734102471,5.102830579804232,5.822646007446338,11.344727608794,5.878215858601149,6.342521466732247,6.342521466732247,6.794506590475304,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852453E-4,2.0810416094933757E-4,2.0815554347424276E-4,2.0811369755170697E-4,2.0813339304459253E-4,2.0810301352577543E-4,2.0816773645214104E-4,2.080720511914945E-4,2.0810420493002455E-4,2.0831925807556964E-4,2.099722107549352E-4,2.0810454866435684E-4,2.083016368228037E-4,2.0832333825958539E-4,2.0822870240647193E-4,2.081145172814403E-4,2.0818611672416987E-4,2.0828408981847662E-4,2.0812526133664216E-4,2.081245004100372E-4,2.0831174003631462E-4,2.0814535236018657E-4,2.081456673701389E-4,2.0827900771323689E-4,2.0812533641266455E-4,2.0832582823766954E-4,2.0817741897229816E-4,2.0810369454473215E-4,2.081980398665426E-4,2.0826158490941754E-4,2.081463733468275E-4,2.082578520116809E-4,2.0836010141789884E-4,2.085534919000554E-4,2.081770592358655E-4,2.0811439105668646E-4,2.081894280477106E-4,2.0813552701656128E-4,2.0807227326983952E-4,2.081251968836356E-4,2.083337738974036E-4,2.0821948970841438E-4,2.0825832659544363E-4,2.080826290036548E-4,2.0812524980460078E-4,2.0811431279772942E-4,2.0818475760570697E-4,2.0822085710288518E-4,2.0817851656820469E-4,2.0814551990552937E-4,2.081148274484333E-4,2.08541220932551E-4,2.0816719513391533E-4,2.0812520210255776E-4,2.0816608032148465E-4,2.081039

also a gender. the combination of the two things is ridiculous.i am sorry because some of the people in the movie aren't bad actors/actresses but the movie itself was awful. it was not credible as a

{"value":"Considering its popularity, I found this movie a huge disappointment. Maybe I was expecting too much from this film. After all, it is one of the most well known martial arts films of the 1970s, but I could never figure out why. The story is uninteresting. It is also a very talky movie with sporadic action sequences. My biggest problem with the movie was that the story does not offer a character that I could root for, since the intended hero is an idiot. Director Chang has no sense of style, and he is unable to hide the glaring imperfections found in the narrative. I know this is not supposed to be high art, but I found the movie boring. Definitely not the best example of this much-beloved genre. Its cult status escapes me.

{"value":"Seemingly intended to be a thriller of a movie winds up being almost laughable. It prompted me to exclaim \"Oh my God!\" more than once at the convoluted contrivances of plot that were just plain silly.<br /><br />Fanciful or absurd locations just for the sheer novelty or dramatic situation and improbable, near impossible, human reactions and circumstances are too much to be comprehended as to why they exist.<br /><br />If you have the time and wish to discover just how bad a picture can be then you will want to see this one. Otherwise dedicate some time into watching some paint dry for a more productive investment of time!<br /><br />(That a film released in 2003 is already being shown on TV in July 2003 might give an

{"value":"Vovochka is your everyday hooligan vs authority movie. Vovochka, the main character, is branded early as a bad influence on the children in the neighborhood. With the words of wisdom from a couple of grownups he meets along the way, he finds changing his mischievous ways hard, yet worthy of doing. Personally, I found actor who played Vovochka too annoying to sympathize with, however the change of tone of the movie would allow most to feel the emotional struggle Vovochka has when he wants to be good but bad things still happen. This struggle makes the movie a little different than other movies of the same genre, that's the little flavor I meant. All in all, I did not really care for this movie, although it was most likely aimed for a younger

{"value":"With nothing better to do I decided to check out \"Aztec Rex\" (as it was being billed) for the hell of it.<br /><br />The silly story might have played better if the dinosaur effects were convincing. They actually looked like animatics (those rough designs that artists later use to finish the CGI effects, adding more details, smoother movements, etc.) Absolutely awful-looking dinosaurs, which is the only reason you'd probably want to sit through this anyway.<br /><br />The one redeeming factor was the lovely Dichen Lachman as Ayacoatl. She kept my interest; if only the budget had been ramped up and some convincing dinosaurs could have been used.<br /><br />Disappointing.

{"value":"I love Zombie-Movies and I love amateur-productions. And Meat Market 2 starts really promising with a nice homage to Fulci´s Classic \"Zombi\".<br /><br />So I leaned back and waited to be impressed. Okay, some of the makeups are great for such a no budget movie and some actors (the vampirelady and the cook) really stand out, but else there´s nothing.<br /><br />I didn´t expect a new Romero here but there is not one sequence in the whole movie which has even a little bit of suspense or shock value. The director sure knows how to stage body rippings and interesting eating habits, but now (after two parts) it´s time to learn something more.<br /><br />In MeatMarket2 Gore rhymes with bore - for me

{"value":"The Brothers Quay are directors, judging by conventional thought, should have stuck to making short films. I myself actually really liked their first feature, Institute Benjamenta, but judging by their sophomore effort, The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes, I'm willing to agree they don't come close to equaling their past genius at feature length. Piano Tuner is, without a doubt, a gorgeous film to look at, and often to listen to. Unfortunately, it's borderline painful to sit through with its convoluted narrative and glacial pace. Reading the plot synopsis, it sounds like a pretty good story. But the Brothers fail miserably to bring it to life. One thing they should consider avoiding completely in the future: dialogue. My God, it's awful here.

{"value":"Holy freaking God all-freaking-mighty. This movie was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way... The character acting is the poorest thing I've seen in quite some time. This movie was more akin to Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO(it's a real movie). Most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen. My favorite part was when they are in the carriage, and you can tell there's no horse. They're fleeing from alien monsters, and going about the same speed as a swift jog. Then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG in general seems to be sub-par to 1992's Beyond the Mind's Eye. I mean, Come on, really.

{"value":"Holy freaking God all-freaking-mighty. This movie was so bad, I thought I was on drugs. In a bad way... The character acting is the poorest thing I've seen in quite some time. This movie was more akin to Lord of the G-Strings, IMHO(it's a real movie). Most of the movie appeared to be done on a horrible green screen. My favorite part was when they are in the carriage, and you can tell there's no horse. They're fleeing from alien monsters, and going about the same speed as a swift jog. Then it switches to a far-shot with a ridiculous CG horse. And the CG in general seems to be sub-par to 1992's Beyond the Mind's Eye. I mean, Come on, really.

{"value":"The long list of \"big\" names in this flick (including the ubiquitous John Mills) didn't bowl me over to the extent that I couldn't judge the film on its actual merits. It is FULL of stereotypes, caricatures, and standard, set scenes, from the humble air-ace hero to the loud-mouthed yank flyer. The music track was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, I thought the film was over: loud, rising crescendo, grand flourish and finish then silence, but then the movie continued! I found no real storyline, haphazard writing, but smartly-pressed uniforms and the pretty Jean Simmons (pre-nose job) with a rousing little ditty. I cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great.

{"value":"This movie is about a cop (Ching Wan Lau) trying to catch a super-clever thief (Ekin Cheng) who blackmails an insurance company headed by a Kelly Lin. Basically, whatever plans the cop tries the thief somehow knows them beforehand. This movie, covered by handsome lead actors, beautiful lead actress and good camera shots of Hong Kong scenes, really has no substance at all. It's all flash, and the flash quickly becomes dull too. I lost all interests a third of the way into the movie, and there is no redeeming quality after that, except for the cinematography, which looks good. Only consider seeing this movie if you can do so for free.

{"value":"This is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re-naming. It doesn't work at all. Firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong. It's very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end. But there is also (and that may have to do with the cuts) an uneasy moving between genres. It starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire. the ending may be funny but it's also so blunt that I almost felt it insulted my intelligence (what little there is). So the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all. You can also see that in the very unsteady character development.You almost get the impression Connery plays three roles rather than one.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","weak","film","with","a","troubl","histori","of","cut","and","renam","it","doe","not","work","at","all","firstli","the","dramaturgi","be","all","wrong","it","veri","slow","move","at","and","then","hastili","and","unsatisfactorili","move","to","a","end","but","there","be","conjur","and","that","mai","have","to","do","with","the","cut","a","uneasi","move","between","genr","it","start","off","with","be","a","thriller","to","be","take","at","face","valu","and","then","degener","into","a","farc","rather","than","satir","the","end","mai","be","funni","but","it","conjur","so","blunt","that","i","almost","feel","it","insult","my","intellig","what","littl","there","be","so","the","film","try","to","be","everyth","but","doe","not","realli","succ","on","ani","level","at","all","you","can","conjur","see","that","in","the","veri","unsteadi","charact","developmenty","almost","get","the","impress","conneri","plai","three","role","rather","than","on"],"filtered":["thi","weak","film","troubl","histori","cut","renam","doe","work","firstli","dramaturgi","wrong","veri","slow","move","hastili","unsatisfactorili","move","end","conjur","mai","cut","uneasi","move","genr","start","thriller","take","face","valu","degener","farc","rather","satir","end","mai","funni","conjur","blunt","almost","feel","insult","intellig","littl","film","try","everyth","doe","realli","succ","ani","level","conjur","see","veri","unsteadi","charact","developmenty","almost","get","impress","conneri","plai","three","role","rather"],"filtered2":["weak","troubl","histori","cut","renam","doe","work","firstli","dramaturgi","wrong","veri","slow","move","hastili","unsatisfactorili","move","end","conjur","mai","cut","uneasi","move","genr","start","thriller","take","face","valu","degener","farc","rather","satir","end","mai","funni","conjur","blunt","almost","feel","insult","intellig","littl","try","everyth","doe","realli","succ","ani","level","conjur","see","veri","unsteadi","charact","developmenty","almost","get","impress","conneri","plai","three","role","rather"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,10,13,14,15,18,24,25,27,31,36,39,40,43,46,48,62,71,128,131,160,193,224,251,275,303,379,390,418,445,451,467,499,603,709,714,752,1139,1278,2641,2981,3623,4062,5142,6584,6868],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,10,13,14,15,18,24,25,27,31,36,39,40,43,46,48,62,71,128,131,160,193,224,251,275,303,379,390,418,445,451,467,499,603,709,714,752,1139,1278,2641,2981,3623,4062,5142,6584,6868],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,2.430631986809635,2.6420723132238515,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,1.4680183469605717,4.661682016458821,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,3.311542587503466,1.6955116224012472,2.0226120445069267,1.9214926742550966,2.3409902041158843,4.502423616410601,4.744459106360251,2.517840471459249,2.689504733779216,2.6942272927333892,8.349854614509423,5.736597900110404,3.1272886331425473,3.132778125427319,3.164467636384302,3.241201430615691,3.216957819005698,3.342254038012865,3.3814747511661465,3.530930586689197,3.6497387377608255,3.7297814454343623,3.719831114581194,4.186539847930077,4.535724120139652,5.3064295350454715,5.373120909544144,6.214688095222362,5.878215858601149,6.1754673820690815,6.543192162194399,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852453E-4,2.0810416094933757E-4,2.0815554347424276E-4,2.0811369755170697E-4,2.0813339304459253E-4,2.0810301352577543E-4,2.0816773645214104E-4,2.080720511914945E-4,2.0810420493002455E-4,2.0831925807556964E-4,2.099722107549352E-4,2.0810454866435684E-4,2.083016368228037E-4,2.0832333825958539E-4,2.0822870240647193E-4,2.081145172814403E-4,2.0818611672416987E-4,2.0828408981847662E-4,2.0812526133664216E-4,2.081245004100372E-4,2.0831174003631462E-4,2.0814535236018657E-4,2.081456673701389E-4,2.0827900771323689E-4,2.0812533641266455E-4,2.0832582823766954E-4,2.0817741897229816E-4,2.0810369454473215E-4,2.081980398665426E-4,2.0826158490941754E-4,2.081463733468275E-4,2.082578520116809E-4,2.0836010141789884E-4,2.085534919000554E-4,2.081770592358655E-4,2.0811439105668646E-4,2.081894280477106E-4,2.0813552701656128E-4,2.0807227326983952E-4,2.081251968836356E-4,2.083337738974036E-4,2.0821948970841438E-4,2.0825832659544363E-4,2.080826290036548E-4,2.0812524980460078E-4,2.0811431279772942E-4,2.0818475760570697E-4,2.0822085710288518E-4,2.0817851656820469E-4,2.0814551990552937E-4,2.081148274484333E-4,2.08541220932551E-4,2.0816719513391533E-4,2.0812520210255776E-4,2.0816608032148465E-4,2.0810390746310166E-4,0.9835521036690726,2.081363751479362E-4,2.081151196150141E-4,2.0810378867208425E-4,2.0827027669504368E-4,2.0818667178510773E-4,2.08103701679

Those kind of mistakes, along with an unclear time line, weird battle tactics, sub-par cutting and poor visual effects, makes this one a sub-par film over all.<br /><br />Then like so many other have commented, all this American bullshit. The German general being practically scared of his captured American private. Be prepared to swallow a lot of it, although in small doses.<br /><br />To sum it up, a not horrible but still definitely sub-par war movie in all aspects.","finished_norm":["i","want","to","sai","the","act","be","bad","but","i","think","it","be","the","direct","that","make","it","so","i","never","think","much","of","highland","same","director","but","that","on","can","be","blame","on","the","sbr","br","thi","on","howev","have","no","excus","peopl","get","shoot","while","exit","trench","with","a","man","in","front","of","him","that","kind","of","mistak","along","with","a","unclear","time","line","weird","battl","tactic","subpar","cut","and","poor","visual","effect","make","thi","on","a","subpar","film","over","allbr","br","then","like","so","mani","other","have","comment","all","thi","american","bullshit","the","german","gener","be","practic","scare","of","hi","captur","american","privat","be","prepar","to","swallow","a","lot","of","it","although","in","small","dosesbr","br","to","sum","it","up","a","not","horribl","but","still","definit","subpar","war","movi","in","all","aspect"],"filtered":["want","sai","act","bad","think","direct","make","never","think","much","highland","director","blame","sbr","br","thi","howev","excus","peopl","get","shoot","exit","trench","man","front","kind","mistak","along","unclear","time","line","weird","battl","tactic","subpar","cut","poor","visual","effect","make","thi","subpar","film","allbr","br","like","mani","comment","thi","american","bullshit","german","gener","practic","scare","hi","captur","american","privat","prepar","swallow","lot","although","small","dosesbr","br","sum","horribl","still","definit","subpar","war","movi","aspect"],"filtered2":["want","act","bad","think","direct","make","never","think","highland","director","blame","sbr","howev","excus","peopl","get","shoot","exit","trench","man","front","kind","mistak","along","unclear","time","line","weird","battl","tactic","subpar","cut","poor","visual","effect","make","subpar","allbr","like","mani","comment","american","bullshit","german","gener","practic","scare","captur","american","privat","prepar","swallow","lot","although","small","dosesbr","sum","horribl","still","definit","subpar","war","aspect"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,8,9,12,21,23,37,42,45,50,58,64,72,102,106,107,113,117,122,146,223,225,230,237,280,303,314,324,363,392,592,617,623,625,635,645,773,786,898,917,924,925,1148,1295,1425,1689,2629,2935,2994,3792,3994,4801,5978,8144],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,8,9,12,21,23,37,42,45,50,58,64,72,102,106,107,113,117,122,146,223,225,230,237,280,303,314,324,363,392,592,617,623,625,635,645,773,786,898,917,924,925,1148,1295,1425,1689,2629,2935,2994,3792,3994,4801,5978,8144],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.133457220525776,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,1.8162961064622165,1.717994385570355,1.865701314626681,1.883428577602134,1.9209463754160525,2.087553710177271,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955,2.1521782565202803,2.2797301185117202,2.2489347673732487,2.326138445979858,5.651126589588952,2.641219492619754,2.7121382192999195,2.640097787510554,2.8028805344481915,2.868298950055202,3.189397019426827,2.8753661172782943,3.0349689855553557,3.0670934723591254,3.5227672760500357,3.5119855004467477,3.607563812710113,3.6194333882654965,3.587125145032839,3.558633189238533,3.7364704335851586,3.900174431363043,3.892300374932137,3.9363956947973615,4.339813719283801,3.969732115064953,4.176068548062782,4.358390104856736,4.443131333311827,4.74221603786142,15.686613902098792,5.3560264761848435,5.521540914662417,5.878215858601149,5.7959777603641776,6.101359409915359,6.437831646536572,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9820803425079215E-4,1.9803239209117214E-4,1.980812878185437E-4,1.9804146714364116E-4,1.9806020941939265E-4,1.9803130020030503E-4,1.980928906839977E-4,1.9800183637269864E-4,1.9803243394329376E-4,1.9823707900490495E-4,1.9981003252786677E-4,1.9803276104166486E-4,1.9822031058076118E-4,1.98240961717279E-4,1.981509060245713E-4,1.9804224720031672E-4,1.981103813925955E-4,1.9820361281160044E-4,1.980524712676428E-4,1.9805174716815775E-4,1.9822992482167903E-4,1.9807158993126735E-4,1.980718896954533E-4,1.9819877666871463E-4,1.980525427101562E-4,1.9824333118607777E-4,1.9810210459216479E-4,1.980319482594906E-4,1.9812172748195065E-4,1.98182197089039E-4,1.9807256150447316E-4,1.9817864485507675E-4,1.9827594562220636E-4,1.9845997644414871E-4,1.9810176226615865E-4,1.9804212708455436E-4,1.981135324555957E-4,1.980622401119636E-4,1.9800204770295603E-4,1.980524099340154E-4,1.982508922939225E-4,1.9814213920018092E-4,1.9817909647006296E-4,1.9801190224276894E-4,1.9805246029372606E-4,1.9804205261315315E-4,1.981090880523801E-4,1.9814344041586422E-4,1.981031490669217E-4,1.9807

{"value":"After the success of Scooby-Doo, Where are You, they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show. But unfortunately, they added a new character that spoilt Scooby-Doo success forever. They invented a new show with a new title, Scooby and Scrappy-Doo. It was Scrappy-Doo that made this show a complete failure, probably for both adults and kids together. Scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up. Scooby and Shaggy were getting scared of the villain, and they were also trying to stop him. Scooby-Doo doesn't need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews. If they wanted Scooby-Doo to be more successful, they should have either killed or never thought up Scrappy.

{"value":"When I first started watching this movie I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train. The interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring. Its not that I don't get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact, it's just that in this film they are very boring. If you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships you'd be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you. It is realistic but you wouldn't go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie.","finished_norm":["when","i","start","watch","thi","movi","i","be","look","for","some","kind","of","subtl","metaphor","but","it","soon","dawn","on","me","that","thi","movi","be","ind","about","peopl","on","a","train","the","interact","between","peopl","be","like","that","you","can","see","ani","dai","on","the","street","and","when","in","occas","there","be","a","slightli","much","interest","situat","the","dialogu","becom","stilt","and","bore","it","not","that","i","do","not","get","how","thi","film","be","try","to","portrai","the","wai","peopl","interact","it","just","that","in","thi","film","thei","be","veri","bore","if","you","want","to","see","and","analys","thi","kind","of","relationship","you","have","be","well","to","actual","go","out","and","bui","a","train","ticket","and","look","at","the","peopl","on","the","train","with","you","it","be","realist","but","you","would","not","go","to","a","movi","to","watch","a","film","about","you","sit","there","watch","the","movi"],"filtered":["start","watch","thi","movi","look","kind","subtl","metaphor","soon","dawn","thi","movi","ind","peopl","train","interact","peopl","like","see","ani","dai","street","occas","slightli","much","interest","situat","dialogu","becom","stilt","bore","get","thi","film","try","portrai","wai","peopl","interact","thi","film","thei","veri","bore","want","see","analys","thi","kind","relationship","well","actual","go","bui","train","ticket","look","peopl","train","realist","go","movi","watch","film","sit","watch","movi"],"filtered2":["start","watch","look","kind","subtl","metaphor","soon","dawn","ind","peopl","train","interact","peopl","like","see","ani","dai","street","occas","slightli","interest","situat","dialogu","becom","stilt","bore","get","try","portrai","wai","peopl","interact","veri","bore","want","see","analys","kind","relationship","well","actual","go","bui","train","ticket","look","peopl","train","realist","go","watch","sit","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,7,15,16,20,23,27,33,36,37,52,60,71,108,115,122,132,244,248,347,449,469,473,577,664,713,829,959,965,1913,2003,2218,2418,2541,2700,2883],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,6,7,15,16,20,23,27,33,36,37,52,60,71,108,115,122,132,244,248,347,449,469,473,577,664,713,829,959,965,1913,2003,2218,2418,2541,2700,2883],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,2.8828493162168796,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.165345040023057,5.459390909503124,1.3002700588679295,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.7122153074726136,1.838176641236591,1.9214926742550966,4.277015007255866,2.201553588425805,4.497869534746497,2.253494045787767,2.634508058031767,2.689504733779216,3.0151989841543516,3.2597778161886266,3.328770687675578,3.335489637924323,3.604618302480356,3.6905607322810807,11.595658248988398,3.8240921249056035,4.067587905068712,3.9868265484242533,9.697192882839982,4.911775343041523,5.014723312293965,5.129498826886393,5.259176650194926,5.243909178064138,5.408212229355414]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651687E-4,2.3166917872259948E-4,2.317263796324284E-4,2.3167979521786152E-4,2.3170172096235658E-4,2.3166790136863852E-4,2.3173995330228196E-4,2.3163343296338666E-4,2.316692276835121E-4,2.3190863272655818E-4,2.3374876022784903E-4,2.3166961034116822E-4,2.3188901610218254E-4,2.3191317493693805E-4,2.3180782283696805E-4,2.3168070777104273E-4,2.3176041489471813E-4,2.3186948213389016E-4,2.3169266844704942E-4,2.3169182135566581E-4,2.3190026336973284E-4,2.317150345107696E-4,2.3171538519139328E-4,2.3186382454808458E-4,2.31692752024429E-4,2.319159468717959E-4,2.3175073223857294E-4,2.3166865950389963E-4,2.3177368817377548E-4,2.3184442884434915E-4,2.3171617111051617E-4,2.318402732457828E-4,2.3195410103209576E-4,2.3216939040434856E-4,2.317503317667922E-4,2.3168056725302076E-4,2.3176410118143947E-4,2.3170409657815956E-4,2.3163368018913922E-4,2.316925966956004E-4,2.319247922714102E-4,2.3179756692385669E-4,2.3184080156982034E-4,2.3164520857154694E-4,2.3169265560915833E-4,2.3168048013228167E-4,2.3175890187423524E-4,2.3179908915749484E-4,2.317519541225616E-4,2.3171522102838555E-4,2.3168105306030655E-4,2.3215572991360726E-4,2.3173935068699446E-4,2.3169260250549583E-4,2.3173810963694015E-4,2.3166889653243174E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908904E-4,2.3168137831085185E-4,2.3166876428991763E-4,2.3185410485865112E-4,2.3176103280889642E-4,2.3166866744629122E-4,2.3164511419405086E-4,2.3162181971902565E-4,2.3183124250942004E-4,2.3168001672688637E-4,2.3178532984537457E-4,2.3185335296367412E-4,2.3174816560918486E-4,2.3169290937467263E-4,2.3164541786535952E-4,2.3170467704319516E-4,2.3164529309826847E-4,2.3165744946862288E-4,2.316454244215022E-4,2.317957946721449E-4,2.3172680482568857E-4,2.3166897666433142E-4,2.3169

{"value":"You know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies? Well if you've always found the plot line of a porn to captivate your interest, then this movie is for you. It truly was like a porn without the sex. Or if that analogy is not to your liking, imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park bench. This is the movie that you would make. -Horrible acting -bad camera work -Music done on a casio keyboard This movie has it all, and more. For those who are masochists in the crowd, this is a premiere piece for your collection. <br /><br />All I can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie, were

{"value":"\"Intensive Care\" by Dorna von Rouveroy is easily one of the worst horror movies ever made.This extremely cheap Dutch slasher flick offers some gore and plenty of absurd situations.A horror veteran George Kennedy is completely wasted as as Professor Bruckner.The acting is abysmal,the action is slow and the climax is laughable.A famous surgeon has a car accident.He lies in a coma seven years and then he wakes up and goes on a bloody rampage.\"Intensive Care\" is clearly influenced by American slasher films including \"Halloween\" and \"Friday the 13th\" series.The killings are hilarious and the dialogs are painfully stupid.Still if you are in the right mood you can give this piece of trash a look.You'll laugh until it hurts with this one-you can believe

{"value":"this movie only gets a second star because i work downtown and liked seeing it destroyed. the effects were pretty good- i hear it was the most expensive Korean film ever made. being the most expensive and still absolutely horrid makes it a massive waste of money. i rented it so i won't complain too much about what i paid, but it was a couple hours that i'll never get back. plot holes abound. terrible acting all across the board. i do not recommend giving up the time to watch this movie, life is too short. if your friends want to watch this, run away. i can't stress enough how bad

{"value":"I caught this a few months ago on Family Channel, and having some memories of the TV show from my youth, decided to watch it along with my 4 year old daughter.

Talking flutes, British children far too old for this kind of crap... in the words of Krusty the Klown \"uuuuuugggghhhhh!

{"value":"Well, this movie started out funny but quickly deteriorated. I thought it would be more 'adult oriented' humor based on the first few moments but then the movie switched into a bad made-for-Disney Channel type mode, especially a go-kart racing scene that was incredibly long. Alana De La Garza is gorgeous but has a really fake Italian accent. The movie looked and sounded very independent and low budget. There was one very cute moment which I'll just call the serenading scene but overall this one was a yawner. The laughs are very few and far between. The end surprise for \"Mr. Fix It\" is so ridiculous it left me more mad than anything else.

{"value":"I actually didn't enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I saw it at a camp, and we didn't rave about it, we laughed at it. Sure, some parts are touching, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole overall movie idea is terrible (now, I know it was based on a book which I haven't read, but I hope that the book was better than this, because frankly, I thought that this movie was very bad and boring). Like I said, I went to it with a bunch of people from a camp, and we were excited to be there, plus I got a caffeinated drink, but nonetheless, I struggled to stay awake. The only thing that kept me up (other than my fear of being embarrassed once I woke up) was the gunshots, that were quite pointless as well.

{"value":"\"Laughter is a state of mind\" says the tag, and I hesitate to comment on Barry Levinson's. What could he have been thinking during the making of \"Toys\"? When he watched the rushes, did he see a successful, funny fantasy? If so, then he's working on a different plane than I. This is an excruciating picture, one in which the production design is 90% of the thing (and even the cartoon colors are a disappointment). Robin Williams and (most especially) Joan Cusack are humiliated as brother and sister of a toy mogul who are bypassed as inheritors of the factory when their dad dies. There's nothing remotely funny (satirical or slapstick-wise) on display here. It is uniformly draggy, ugly, and one of the very worst \"big\" movies ever made.

{"value":"I really wish i could give this a negative vote, because i think i just wasted 83 minutes of my life watching the worst horror movie ever put to film. the acting was just god awful, i mean REALLLYYYY bad, the dialog was worse, the script sounded like it was written by.... i can't think of anything horrible enough to say. And the day \"outside\" and the night \"inside\" shots make you think the events took over several days. Terribly acted, directed, written, etc etc. all the way down to the gofer how gets lunch for everyone. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS. If my only saving grace to stay out of hell is by doing one good deed, it is to tell the world to not watch this crap.

{"value":"I saw this movie with the intention of not liking it. I sure didn't. It's one of those movies that seems to have been made exclusively for the Oscars: music throughout the film in almost every single frame, almost no profanity, set in a time long gone, sepia-toned imagery, pretentious title, NO SEX, and a genius that explains everything he thinks and concludes in sfx/cgi so that we (the stupid audience) get it. One thing that amused me though is the fact that they spelled the NOBEL PRICE WRONG! Instead they call the Nobel-price (named after an actual person called Alfred Nobel) 'the noble-price'.. Jesus! How can one make such a mistake in such a big production, supposedly based on a true story. What a sham!

{"value":"For a comedic writer, Woody Allen really lets the paying viewer down with this meager attempt at character development. There are a few entertaining moments, but no more than one would have listening to their dryer tumbling tennis balls.<br /><br />Will Ferrell wastes his time in this movie which fails to showcase his usually funny delivery. Amanda Peet did well, but again, didn't have the room to move in this otherwise corpse like movie. The movie is so heavy and dull that it cannot be carried but if it were carried, Radha Mitchell did it. <br /><br />If you enjoy movies that go on and on in one scene and don't really accomplish anything but to show that their writer can write a few lines of snappy dialogue on occasion, then you'll love this movie.","finished_norm":["for","a","comed","writer","woodi","allen","realli","let","the","pai","viewer","down","with","thi","meager","attempt","at","charact","develop","there","be","a","few","entertain","moment","but","no","much","than","on","would","have","listen","to","their","dry","tumbl","tenni","ballsbr","br","will","ferrel","wast","hi","time","in","thi","movi","which","fail","to","showcas","hi","usual","funni","deliveri","amanda","peet","do","good","but","again","do","not","have","the","room","to","move","in","thi","otherwis","corps","like","movi","the","movi","be","so","heavi","and","dull","that","it","cannot","be","carri","but","if","it","be","carri","radha","mitchel","do","it","br","br","if","you","enjoi","movi","that","go","on","and","on","in","on","scene","and","do","not","realli","accomplish","anyth","but","to","show","that","their","writer","can","write","a","few","line","of","snappi","dialogu","on","occas","then","you","will","love","thi","movi"],"filtered":["comed","writer","woodi","allen","realli","let","pai","viewer","thi","meager","attempt","charact","develop","entertain","moment","much","listen","dry","tumbl","tenni","ballsbr","br","ferrel","wast","hi","time","thi","movi","fail","showcas","hi","usual","funni","deliveri","amanda","peet","good","room","move","thi","otherwis","corps","like","movi","movi","heavi","dull","carri","carri","radha","mitchel","br","br","enjoi","movi","go","scene","realli","accomplish","anyth","show","writer","write","line","snappi","dialogu","occas","love","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["comed","writer","woodi","allen","realli","let","pai","viewer","meager","attempt","charact","develop","entertain","moment","listen","dry","tumbl","tenni","ballsbr","ferrel","wast","time","fail","showcas","usual","funni","deliveri","amanda","peet","good","room","move","otherwis","corps","like","heavi","dull","carri","carri","radha","mitchel","enjoi","go","scene","realli","accomplish","anyth","show","writer","write","line","snappi","dialogu","occas","love"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,10,13,19,28,54,62,65,89,104,107,124,177,188,195,200,215,248,265,275,279,287,320,322,367,513,621,627,845,1177,1345,1571,1682,1761,2000,2113,2418,2901,3259,3392,4158,4382,6908,7305,7769],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,8,10,13,19,28,54,62,65,89,104,107,124,177,188,195,200,215,248,265,275,279,287,320,322,367,513,621,627,845,1177,1345,1571,1682,1761,2000,2113,2418,2901,3259,3392,4158,4382,6908,7305,7769],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,2.2635883139467947,1.312380678011735,1.5452294193519092,1.8113893252729412,2.0226120445069267,1.9073850067444174,1.9940046109572438,2.0728240170322856,2.1439533986393955,2.2323930368088845,2.458149992634611,2.5378812223426954,2.51289241584188,2.5308211829319704,2.605934685587711,2.689504733779216,2.73529586597515,2.7832848715031413,2.7910771187233068,5.68378037616381,2.938298364153555,2.885344817328191,3.0791938792932125,3.454678155189441,7.0893719235153645,3.477726550625732,3.831445099210862,4.263079925052412,4.760735085628657,4.715065048795469,4.706176101378222,5.156897801074508,4.8796870284900224,5.00274712124725,5.129498826886393,5.3560264761848435,5.770002273960917,5.672363804397,5.907203395474402,6.342521466732247,6.868614562629026,6.725513718988353,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.363349508791837E-4,2.3612552253122083E-4,2.3618382374676053E-4,2.3613634324334585E-4,2.3615869074724918E-4,2.3612422060632449E-4,2.3619765851711934E-4,2.3608908917345202E-4,2.3612557243393614E-4,2.3636958262639057E-4,2.3824510646673123E-4,2.361259624523214E-4,2.3634958866039762E-4,2.363742122098566E-4,2.3626683357713408E-4,2.361372733502247E-4,2.3621851370481608E-4,2.3632967894044447E-4,2.3614946409949693E-4,2.3614860071362624E-4,2.3636105227822549E-4,2.361722603925214E-4,2.3617261781877017E-4,2.3632391252640538E-4,2.3614954928455494E-4,2.3637703746512076E-4,2.3620864479495773E-4,2.3612499332492982E-4,2.3623204230611904E-4,2.3630414373063965E-4,2.361734188556823E-4,2.362999081957777E-4,2.3641592555151715E-4,2.3663535618876854E-4,2.3620823661977877E-4,2.3613713012922508E-4,2.3622227090024052E-4,2.361611120599413E-4,2.3608934115479165E-4,2.3614939096785082E-4,2.3638605301314248E-4,2.362563803832487E-4,2.3630044668255496E-4,2.361010912949483E-4,2.3614945101465865E-4,2.361370413326482E-4,2.3621697158016192E-4,2.3625793189828065E-4,2.36209890182872E-4,2.3617245049795436E-4,2.3613762528140647E-4,2.366214329274521E-4,2.3619704431003996E-4,2.3614939688950429E-4,2.3619577938738528E-4,2.3612523491289725E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276137E-4,2.3613795678840876E-4,2.3612510012659154E-4,2.3631400587089356E-4,2.3621914350507278E-4,2.3612500142009975E-4,2.361009

Quite a lot of racist/sexist/\"homophobic\" humor in it, skits based on stereotypes, or skits which use racist terms for people.<br /><br />I'm trying to remember anything I thought was funny in it, and I'm having trouble.... The logo for the Tunnel Vision network is a lipsticked mouth with an eyeball in it. The mouth opens and closes over the eye like eyelids. Kind of creepy.<br /><br />What a disappointment. Most of the actors went on to better things, and it's lucky this bomb didn't hold them

{"value":"I was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was. Was the viewer supposed to learn something, or reflect on anything here? What was up with the pumpkins? Was I supposed to be impressed with the motel shots? Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel? Why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews (it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery). The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished.<br /><br />I am truly amazed.

{"value":"Rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to \"Ordinary People\"--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. Despite downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. Unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of \"The Natural\".

{"value":"What a stinkeroo this turned out to be!!! At one time, much earlier in her career, Linda Darnell was one of my favorites - no great shakes as an Actress, but very beautiful and pleasant (particularly in films like \"The Mark of Zorro\" and \"Blood and Sand\") but when I saw this monstrosity, the memories of her golden days faded quickly. The story is unbelievable and farcical, the acting second-rate, the supporting cast insufferable. I cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to Tab Hunter, and Donald Gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked. Added to this, was the terrible photography (and I am not just referring to the color!)
