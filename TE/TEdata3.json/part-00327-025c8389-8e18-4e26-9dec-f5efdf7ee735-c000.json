This film is an abomination.It's nothing but footage from the first film. Whatever is original is freaky and makes no sense whatsoever. It's like some sort of drug hallucination.Like, what's with the laying on a mirror naked therapy. Also, whatever moron patched together this turd didn't even bother to watch the first film, because they kept calling Suzanna Love's character Natalie, when it's Lacey.

{"value":"\"Trigger Man\" is definitely the most boring and silliest movie I've ever seen in my life. My aunt's holiday videos are more fascinating.<br /><br />The actors seem to be recruited at uglypeople.com. They do not have any talent to act in a convincing manner.<br /><br />They walk and walk and walk through the forest. There's more walking-around than in all three parts of \"The Lord of the Rings\" together. After the first hour, I began to read a Porsche brochure while watching \"Trigger Man\" along the way. Awful.<br /><br />A total waste of time and money.

{"value":"May I please have my $13.00 back? I would have rather watched \"Hydro- Electric Power Comes to North America\". Again. This is a movie with one voice. The same voice, which comes out of every characters mouth regardless of age or gender. To listen to that voice again I would have to charge at least $150 an hour. And I don't take insurance. It was eerie watching Will Ferrell morph into Woody. But I don't think imaginative casting is enough. One should wait until they have a story before they bother making a movie. Unless he's just doing it for the money.

Not having any expectations beforehand, I am left with: an aged Xander from Buffy and a heroine with ape-like face who doesn't seem to know how to act.

{"value":"The movie 'Gung Ho!': The Story of Carlson's Makin Island Raiders was made in 1943 with a view to go up the moral of American people at the duration of second world war. It shows with the better way that the cinema can constitute body of propaganda. The value of this film is only collection and no artistic. In a film of propaganda it is useless to judge direction and actors. Watch that movie if you are interested to learn how propaganda functions in the movies or if you are a big fun of Robert Mitchum who has a small role in the film. If you want to see a film for the second world war, they exist much better and objective. I rated it 4/10.","finished_norm":["the","movi","gung","ho","the","stori","of","carlson","makin","island","raider","be","make","in","with","a","view","to","go","up","the","moral","of","american","peopl","at","the","durat","of","world","war","it","show","with","the","well","wai","that","the","cinema","can","constitut","bodi","of","propaganda","the","valu","of","thi","film","be","onli","collect","and","no","artist","in","a","film","of","propaganda","it","be","useless","to","judg","direct","and","actor","watch","that","movi","if","you","be","interest","to","learn","how","propaganda","function","in","the","movi","or","if","you","be","a","big","fun","of","robert","mitchum","who","have","a","small","role","in","the","film","if","you","want","to","see","a","film","for","the","world","war","thei","exist","much","well","and","object","i","rate","it"],"filtered":["movi","gung","ho","stori","carlson","makin","island","raider","make","view","go","moral","american","peopl","durat","world","war","show","well","wai","cinema","constitut","bodi","propaganda","valu","thi","film","onli","collect","artist","film","propaganda","useless","judg","direct","actor","watch","movi","interest","learn","propaganda","function","movi","big","fun","robert","mitchum","small","role","film","want","see","film","world","war","thei","exist","much","well","object","rate"],"filtered2":["gung","ho","stori","carlson","makin","island","raider","make","view","go","moral","american","peopl","durat","world","war","show","well","wai","cinema","constitut","bodi","propaganda","valu","onli","collect","artist","propaganda","useless","judg","direct","actor","watch","interest","learn","propaganda","function","big","fun","robert","mitchum","small","role","want","see","world","war","exist","well","object","rate"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,7,11,17,20,23,28,33,37,41,60,82,102,128,165,202,223,259,312,314,363,376,409,431,451,528,539,719,724,878,1023,1026,1261,1657,1959,2441,3677,3894,4194,4826,5023],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,7,11,17,20,23,28,33,37,41,60,82,102,128,165,202,223,259,312,314,363,376,409,431,451,528,539,719,724,878,1023,1026,1261,1657,1959,2441,3677,3894,4194,4826,5023],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,2.330690080046114,1.364847727375781,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.838176641236591,2.020196584395323,2.087553710177271,2.3409902041158843,4.897695199944596,2.597304642813496,2.825563294794476,2.7464553122240485,2.8824835850471584,6.378794038853654,3.0349689855553557,3.1569204307489187,3.2209578243390444,3.2189558216683714,3.216957819005698,3.4198487640477615,3.6105180246075443,4.072271754381138,3.7987743169213135,4.067587905068712,4.1302590120314875,4.062925891962901,4.383707912841026,14.396504795582782,4.900964426937307,5.185068678041204,6.255510089742618,5.7446844659766265,6.214688095222362,6.437831646536572,6.137727054086234]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.508084609727827E-4,2.50586206915813E-4,2.506480785860334E-4,2.5059769030472606E-4,2.5062140640359223E-4,2.505848252590655E-4,2.506627606186684E-4,2.505475423240712E-4,2.505862598746461E-4,2.5084521362060496E-4,2.5283559737960333E-4,2.505866737783476E-4,2.50823995193873E-4,2.508501267267695E-4,2.507361720640575E-4,2.5059867737275797E-4,2.506848930096248E-4,2.508028661725358E-4,2.5061161470196677E-4,2.506106984410386E-4,2.5083616086100724E-4,2.506358070744791E-4,2.506361863900523E-4,2.507967466145733E-4,2.5061170510388666E-4,2.5085312500494215E-4,2.5067441971278974E-4,2.5058564530012773E-4,2.506992501229476E-4,2.5077576714783404E-4,2.506370364836773E-4,2.507712722224065E-4,2.5089439465660805E-4,2.5112726355820117E-4,2.5067398654034505E-4,2.505985253806875E-4,2.506888803013837E-4,2.5062397600113836E-4,2.5054780973712945E-4,2.5061153709162793E-4,2.508626926787701E-4,2.5072507870075726E-4,2.50771843686929E-4,2.505602794736535E-4,2.506116008157932E-4,2.505984311460739E-4,2.5068325644292275E-4,2.5072672523291804E-4,2.5067574137014486E-4,2.506360088222565E-4,2.5059905085673793E-4,2.511124876152883E-4,2.506621087966179E-4,2.5061154337593244E-4,2.506607664081853E-4,2.5058590168330793E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867684E-4,2.5059940266573084E-4,2.505857586424849E-4,2.507862332604838E-4,2.5068556137980246E-4,2.505856538910581E-4,2.5056017738972984E-4,2.5053498079616115E-4,2.507615040780928E-4,2.505979299011482E-4,2.507118423993318E-4,2.5078541996925827E-4,2.506716435043771E-4,2.506118753026197E-4,2.505605058574259E-4,2.506246038642504E-4,2.505603709024342E-4,2.505735199054815E-4,2.5056051294891277E-4,2.507231617352092E-4,2.5064853849859865E-4,2.50585988358406E-4,2.5061026230912783E-4]}}
{"value":"If you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault, then this film is not the film that you want to watch. It was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back. Spoiler: Rosario Dawson turns the tables on her assailant. Instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to using vigilantism. She in essence nullifies the judicial system. The film \"The Accused\" was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins. What the \"Descent\" does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence? Is victim any better that the accuser?

{"value":"I do regret that I have bought this series. I expected more action, more objective picture and more consistency. This is just a pure propaganda series, very dark, without any charm, or romanticism, it is just boredom itself. I find the actors work quite weak as well. O'Donnell might seem charming as Robin (with Batman), but in this picture he lacks any charm. Probably while he becomes older, he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up. It comes as no surprise, that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the UK for 40% of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands.","finished_norm":["i","do","regret","that","i","have","bui","thi","seri","i","expect","much","action","much","object","pictur","and","much","consist","thi","be","just","a","pure","propaganda","seri","veri","dark","without","ani","charm","or","romantic","it","be","just","boredom","itself","i","find","the","actor","work","quit","weak","a","good","o","donnel","mai","seem","charm","a","robin","with","batman","but","in","thi","pictur","he","lack","ani","charm","probabl","while","he","becom","old","he","be","loos","hi","childish","charm","but","doe","not","gain","ani","charm","of","a","grow","up","it","come","a","no","surpris","that","it","be","not","show","in","a","lot","of","countri","and","be","be","sell","in","the","uk","for","of","the","recommend","price","and","be","not","even","releas","in","the","netherland"],"filtered":["regret","bui","thi","seri","expect","much","action","much","object","pictur","much","consist","thi","pure","propaganda","seri","veri","dark","without","ani","charm","romantic","boredom","find","actor","work","quit","weak","good","o","donnel","mai","seem","charm","robin","batman","thi","pictur","lack","ani","charm","probabl","becom","old","loos","hi","childish","charm","doe","gain","ani","charm","grow","come","surpris","show","lot","countri","sell","uk","recommend","price","even","releas","netherland"],"filtered2":["regret","bui","expect","action","object","pictur","consist","pure","propaganda","veri","dark","without","ani","charm","romantic","boredom","find","actor","work","quit","weak","good","o","donnel","mai","seem","charm","robin","batman","pictur","lack","ani","charm","probabl","becom","old","loos","childish","charm","doe","gain","ani","charm","grow","come","surpris","show","lot","countri","sell","uk","recommend","price","even","releas","netherland"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,15,18,27,28,34,35,38,41,46,48,67,72,115,120,125,129,130,148,183,298,311,326,327,347,368,379,561,608,726,797,828,861,940,994,1086,1261,1627,1648,1657,1678,1755,1766,1837,2572],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,15,18,27,28,34,35,38,41,46,48,67,72,115,120,125,129,130,148,183,298,311,326,327,347,368,379,561,608,726,797,828,861,940,994,1086,1261,1627,1648,1657,1678,1755,1766,1837,2572],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,3.9008101766037884,1.5452294193519092,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,1.655771293751733,1.6955116224012472,1.9570915389266579,1.9209463754160525,2.201553588425805,2.2044500422972613,2.2242236634876535,2.4106958340079214,2.2642139034199635,2.3018654096236517,2.4885128563647294,2.7819920465008363,5.8406676183565125,2.942840385588056,2.9674191958529437,3.0151989841543516,3.1346146732346205,3.1272886331425473,3.4725585804672896,3.616452760127359,3.6466665387238555,18.993871584606566,3.827761853794566,3.892300374932137,3.952924996748572,4.140259095366071,5.116075806554253,4.383707912841026,4.944927550358424,4.706176101378222,4.798834931860927,4.679973728984199,4.715065048795469,4.715065048795469,4.911775343041523,5.1994574154933035]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255732E-4,2.2737792632708293E-4,2.2743406769354623E-4,2.273883461709778E-4,2.2740986578072454E-4,2.2737667263379304E-4,2.274473899357235E-4,2.2734284269338757E-4,2.273779743810832E-4,2.2761294487884303E-4,2.2941898734736644E-4,2.2737834995069855E-4,2.275936916169432E-4,2.2761740295299348E-4,2.2751400231007038E-4,2.2738924182076232E-4,2.2746747251417928E-4,2.2757451948007219E-4,2.2740098094688549E-4,2.2740014954633717E-4,2.276047305492109E-4,2.2742293271974036E-4,2.2742327690463993E-4,2.2756896669080785E-4,2.274010629761453E-4,2.2762012354277312E-4,2.2745796921172114E-4,2.2737741672597007E-4,2.2748049992975638E-4,2.2754993025739305E-4,2.2742404826603296E-4,2.2754585163377173E-4,2.2765757096628267E-4,2.2786887249242013E-4,2.274575761579556E-4,2.2738910390558248E-4,2.2747109051910844E-4,2.274121973925428E-4,2.2734308533973037E-4,2.2740091052450223E-4,2.2762880509736284E-4,2.2750393636919423E-4,2.2754637017156237E-4,2.2735440017971134E-4,2.274009683467931E-4,2.2738901839859747E-4,2.2746598751966347E-4,2.2750543040620828E-4,2.2745916846251955E-4,2.274231157824549E-4,2.2738958071416722E-4,2.27855465037555E-4,2.2744679848279393E-4,2.2740091622677985E-4,2.2744558042094655E-4,2.2737764936397748E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.27413124074414E-4,2.2738989994003464E-4,2.2737751957101668E-4,2.275594270410361E-4,2.2746807898261538E-4,2.2737742452124326E-4,2.2735430755038764E-4,2.2733144456336748E-4,2.2753698817546151E-4,2.2738856357694873E-4,2.2749192596045143E-4,2.275586890735532E-4,2.2745545012449887E-4,2.2740121741176035E-4,2.273546055967347E-4,2.2741276710551382E-4,2.273544831407283E-4,2.2736641433631545E-4,2

{"value":"This is arguably the worst film I have ever seen, and I have quite an appetite for awful (and good) movies. It could (just) have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue-in-cheek --à la ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, which was really very funny. Other movies, like PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE, manage to be funny while (apparently) trying to be serious. As to the acting, it looks like they rounded up brain-dead teenagers and asked them to ad-lib the whole production. Compared to them, Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness. There was one decent interpretation -- that of the older ghoul-busting broad on the motorcycle.","finished_norm":["thi","be","arguabl","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","and","i","have","quit","a","appetit","for","aw","and","good","movi","it","can","just","have","manag","a","kind","of","adolesc","humour","if","it","have","be","consist","tongueincheek","à","la","rocki","horror","pictur","show","which","be","realli","veri","funni","other","movi","like","plan","nine","from","outer","space","manag","to","be","funni","while","appar","try","to","be","seriou","a","to","the","act","it","look","like","thei","round","up","braindead","teenag","and","ask","them","to","adlib","the","whole","product","compar","to","them","tom","cruis","look","like","alec","guin","there","be","on","decent","interpret","that","of","the","old","ghoulbust","broad","on","the","motorcycl"],"filtered":["thi","arguabl","wrong","film","ever","see","quit","appetit","aw","good","movi","manag","kind","adolesc","humour","consist","tongueincheek","à","la","rocki","horror","pictur","show","realli","veri","funni","movi","like","plan","nine","outer","space","manag","funni","appar","try","seriou","act","look","like","thei","round","braindead","teenag","ask","adlib","whole","product","compar","tom","cruis","look","like","alec","guin","decent","interpret","old","ghoulbust","broad","motorcycl"],"filtered2":["arguabl","wrong","ever","see","quit","appetit","aw","good","manag","kind","adolesc","humour","consist","tongueincheek","à","la","rocki","horror","pictur","show","realli","veri","funni","like","plan","nine","outer","space","manag","funni","appar","try","seriou","act","look","like","round","braindead","teenag","ask","adlib","whole","product","compar","tom","cruis","look","like","alec","guin","decent","interpret","old","ghoulbust","broad","motorcycl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,13,15,16,21,25,28,36,44,62,67,83,111,120,122,138,190,306,308,309,311,345,482,493,581,637,693,759,766,828,1235,1480,2075,2456,2481,2576,2922,3263,3941,4064,4095,5026,5038,5228,6138,7060],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,13,15,16,21,25,28,36,44,62,67,83,111,120,122,138,190,306,308,309,311,345,482,493,581,637,693,759,766,828,1235,1480,2075,2456,2481,2576,2922,3263,3941,4064,4095,5026,5038,5228,6138,7060],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.5452294193519092,1.4680183469605717,1.604729392502474,4.045224089013853,1.9570915389266579,2.292318797740072,2.1183455303375887,2.2044500422972613,2.2489347673732487,2.2907365189289424,2.558331832813986,2.8739486825973213,2.8753661172782943,2.848772527704847,2.9203338091782562,6.004465676314169,3.3154667220492153,3.342254038012865,3.530930586689197,3.7432044657665027,3.753391311073496,3.969732115064953,3.9825254665248626,3.827761853794566,4.4637506205145625,4.5432147918688095,5.0768550934009715,5.214056214914456,5.143104478942172,5.214056214914456,5.482320201509136,5.5623629091826725,5.878215858601149,6.032366538428407,5.850044981634453,6.255510089742618,6.214688095222362,6.2980697041614135,7.0356686472921925,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125572E-4,2.273779263270828E-4,2.274340676935461E-4,2.2738834617097765E-4,2.2740986578072443E-4,2.2737667263379293E-4,2.2744738993572337E-4,2.2734284269338746E-4,2.2737797438108308E-4,2.276129448788429E-4,2.294189873473663E-4,2.2737834995069841E-4,2.2759369161694305E-4,2.2761740295299337E-4,2.2751400231007027E-4,2.273892418207622E-4,2.2746747251417917E-4,2.2757451948007208E-4,2.2740098094688535E-4,2.2740014954633704E-4,2.276047305492108E-4,2.2742293271974025E-4,2.2742327690463982E-4,2.275689666908077E-4,2.2740106297614517E-4,2.2762012354277298E-4,2.2745796921172103E-4,2.2737741672596996E-4,2.2748049992975627E-4,2.2754993025739294E-4,2.2742404826603285E-4,2.2754585163377162E-4,2.2765757096628256E-4,2.2786887250399965E-4,2.274575761579555E-4,2.2738910390558234E-4,2.274710905191083E-4,2.2741219739254268E-4,2.2734308533973026E-4,2.274009105245021E-4,2.2762880509736273E-4,2.275039363691941E-4,2.2754637017156223E-4,2.2735440017971123E-4,2.2740096834679297E-4,2.2738901839859736E-4,2.2746598751966334E-4,2.2750543040620818E-4,2.2745916846251944E-4,2.2742311578245478E-4,2.2738958071416712E-4,2.2785546503755488E-4,2.2744679848279382E-4,2.2740091622677975E-4,2.2744558042094644E-4,2.2737764936397737E-4,0.9820287660606557,2.274131240744139E-4,2.273898999400345E-4,2.2737751957101657E-4,2.2755942704103598E-4,2.2746807898261525E-4,2.2737742452124313E-4,2.273543075503875E-4,2.2733144456336734E-4,2.275369881754614E-4,2.273885635769486E-4,2.274919259604513E-4,2.275586890735531E-4,2.2745545012449876E-4,2.274012174117602E-4,2.273546055967346E-4,2.2741276710551368E-4,2.2735448314072817E-4,2.27366414336315

Take away the fact that the movie has no historical truth it, and it is still the worse movie ever found in a video store. It is not even good enough to be called a B rated movie. Do not waste your money or your time on this movie. Just listing to the voice over and the horrible music made me sick. Anyone involved with this movie should be pulled from the union, gives the industry a black mark, but after watching most of this movie I really don't think anyone involved is a union

{"value":"I think scarecrows are creepy, so it's a pity this movie doesn't make more of them. <br /><br />A bunch of robbers do an emergency parachute from a plane into a enormous field with scarecrows. One of them goes missing with the loot and so the rest chase him down while being set upon by inexplicably evil scarecrows. The acting is hammy and the scarecrows unimpressive (when they move). On the positive side, the director does get some suspense out of the static scarecrows. It is as Alfred Hitchcock says, \"A bomb under a table goes off, and that's surprise. We know the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off, and that's suspense.\"","finished_norm":["i","think","scarecrow","be","creepi","so","it","a","piti","thi","movi","doe","not","make","much","of","them","br","br","a","bunch","of","robber","do","a","emerg","parachut","from","a","plane","into","a","enorm","field","with","scarecrow","on","of","them","go","miss","with","the","loot","and","so","the","rest","chase","him","down","while","be","set","upon","by","inexplic","evil","scarecrow","the","act","be","hammi","and","the","scarecrow","unimpress","when","thei","move","on","the","posit","side","the","director","doe","get","some","suspens","out","of","the","static","scarecrow","it","be","a","alfr","hitchcock","sai","a","bomb","under","a","tabl","go","off","and","that","surpris","we","know","the","bomb","be","under","the","tabl","but","not","when","it","will","go","off","and","that","suspens"],"filtered":["think","scarecrow","creepi","piti","thi","movi","doe","make","much","br","br","bunch","robber","emerg","parachut","plane","enorm","field","scarecrow","go","miss","loot","rest","chase","set","upon","inexplic","evil","scarecrow","act","hammi","scarecrow","unimpress","thei","move","posit","side","director","doe","get","suspens","static","scarecrow","alfr","hitchcock","sai","bomb","tabl","go","surpris","know","bomb","tabl","go","suspens"],"filtered2":["think","scarecrow","creepi","piti","doe","make","bunch","robber","emerg","parachut","plane","enorm","field","scarecrow","go","miss","loot","rest","chase","set","upon","inexplic","evil","scarecrow","act","hammi","scarecrow","unimpress","move","posit","side","director","doe","get","suspens","static","scarecrow","alfr","hitchcock","bomb","tabl","go","surpris","know","bomb","tabl","go","suspens"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,12,18,21,26,58,109,226,255,275,321,326,419,425,509,529,530,630,755,1079,1088,1266,1282,1713,1868,2005,2010,2496,3014,3058,3323,4089,4098,4365,6566],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,6,12,18,21,26,58,109,226,255,275,321,326,419,425,509,529,530,630,755,1079,1088,1266,1282,1713,1868,2005,2010,2496,3014,3058,3323,4089,4098,4365,6566],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,2.912480743411154,1.066728610262888,2.430631986809635,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.865701314626681,2.125691139326857,2.5940874818617203,2.6754694156628323,2.7832848715031413,3.09496984188738,2.942840385588056,3.1758963322079246,3.226987993365636,3.360519385990158,6.929712720210395,3.5784919978881358,3.558633189238533,3.79165684915245,8.560544651185568,4.513582994262438,4.327618446189983,4.449957298382227,29.997883578027086,4.789173020949191,9.845408827147427,4.9676558014359795,5.390512652256013,5.408212229355414,5.850044981634453,5.583416318380505,5.822646007446338,5.822646007446338,5.9370563586240825,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.560351204035198E-4,2.5580823473939307E-4,2.558713957686224E-4,2.5581995743348244E-4,2.558441677579872E-4,2.5580682428995955E-4,2.5588638376375974E-4,2.557687644066795E-4,2.5580828880184843E-4,2.560726389488425E-4,2.5810450080632446E-4,2.558087113309913E-4,2.5605097834607805E-4,2.560776544404392E-4,2.5596132504838103E-4,2.558209650712687E-4,2.559089773770747E-4,2.5602940901184947E-4,2.558341720046745E-4,2.5583323664955863E-4,2.5606339753655283E-4,2.558588685280095E-4,2.558592557482336E-4,2.5602316192690794E-4,2.558342642905023E-4,2.5608071520047084E-4,2.558982858246215E-4,2.5580766142005993E-4,2.559236336818261E-4,2.560017452638825E-4,2.558601235571695E-4,2.559971566675944E-4,2.5612284488059524E-4,2.563605665947128E-4,2.5589784362518934E-4,2.55820809911798E-4,2.559130477609908E-4,2.558467909040109E-4,2.5576903739242454E-4,2.5583409277699467E-4,2.560904822574155E-4,2.559500005077446E-4,2.559977400410072E-4,2.557817669888662E-4,2.558341578291235E-4,2.5582071371340595E-4,2.5590730670555515E-4,2.559516813523955E-4,2.5589963502432053E-4,2.558590744800586E-4,2.5582134633837355E-4,2.5634548273227814E-4,2.5588571835822855E-4,2.558340991922593E-4,2.5588434799543206E-4,2.558079231460725E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.558478334539957E-4,2.5582170547880085E-4,2.558077771243864E-4,2.5601242948243737E-4,2.5590965967558344E-4,2.558076701900188E-4,2.5578166277759047E-4,2.557559411059886E-4,2.559871849625101E-4,2.5582020202291356E-4,2.5593648837176627E-4,2.560115992428352E-4,2.558954517621165E-4,2.558344380360487E-4,2.5578199809030594E-4,2.5584743185131737E-4,2.5578186032295384E-4,2.5579528334132145E-4,2.55782005329574E-4,2.5594804359407825E-4,2.5587186526541906E-4,2.5580801162741436E-4,2.5583279142898734E-4]}}
{"value":"For loyal Duran Duran fans who want to watch a good music video, skip this one. The producers decided to get creative and make this 80's video something of a sci-fi story, involving the evil Barbarella villain from which the band got its name. <br /><br />What makes this idea fail is that right in the middle of some great 80's Duran Duran songs, confusing and annoying cut scenes take place showing the fictional antagonist trying to stop the band at one of their concerts. Not only is the good music repeatedly interrupted, but we have to suffer through some cheap spin-off story hosted by an evil Dr. Mario.

{"value":"When I saw this movie, circa 1979, it became the first movie that I ever walked out of in the middle. There is nothing worse than comedy that just misses being funny, and this misses every time (although I can't speak for the last 25 minutes of the movie). There was nothing original about any of the skits. While I enjoy racy humor where appropriate, these skits were needlessly vulgar. What was even more irritating was that this movie was advertised as \"Robin William's first movie\", capitalizing on his new found fame in the \"Mork and Mindy\" television series. Yet his role turned out to be so minor that you cannot even notice him on-screen.","finished_norm":["when","i","see","thi","movi","circa","it","becom","the","movi","that","i","ever","walk","out","of","in","the","middl","there","be","noth","wrong","than","comedi","that","just","miss","be","funni","and","thi","miss","everi","time","although","i","ca","not","speak","for","the","last","minut","of","the","movi","there","be","noth","origin","about","ani","of","the","skit","while","i","enjoi","raci","humor","where","appropri","thi","skit","be","needlessli","vulgar","what","be","even","much","irrit","be","that","thi","movi","be","advertis","a","robin","william","movi","capit","on","hi","new","find","fame","in","the","mork","and","mindi","televis","seri","yet","hi","role","turn","out","to","be","so","minor","that","you","cannot","even","notic","him","onscreen"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","circa","becom","movi","ever","walk","middl","noth","wrong","comedi","miss","funni","thi","miss","everi","time","although","ca","speak","last","minut","movi","noth","origin","ani","skit","enjoi","raci","humor","appropri","thi","skit","needlessli","vulgar","even","much","irrit","thi","movi","advertis","robin","william","movi","capit","hi","new","find","fame","mork","mindi","televis","seri","yet","hi","role","turn","minor","even","notic","onscreen"],"filtered2":["see","circa","becom","ever","walk","middl","noth","wrong","comedi","miss","funni","miss","everi","time","although","ca","speak","last","minut","noth","origin","ani","skit","enjoi","raci","humor","appropri","skit","needlessli","vulgar","even","irrit","advertis","robin","william","capit","new","find","fame","mork","mindi","televis","yet","role","turn","minor","even","notic","onscreen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,8,25,27,38,44,49,59,62,69,81,85,87,96,115,127,128,144,194,200,237,255,294,344,369,554,663,688,720,958,1097,1535,1627,1748,1972,2123,2302,2764,3182,4991,6130],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,8,25,27,38,44,49,59,62,69,81,85,87,96,115,127,128,144,194,200,237,255,294,344,369,554,663,688,720,958,1097,1535,1627,1748,1972,2123,2302,2764,3182,4991,6130],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.852034211452262,0.9418936859054116,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.519311641348122,1.604729392502474,3.3840606616174704,1.8693254449200722,2.0226120445069267,2.127032521151058,1.949757232424728,2.011190219103739,2.115024371522662,2.0390708128715254,2.201553588425805,2.4359679371086367,2.3409902041158843,2.2931108769894046,2.5378812223426954,2.5308211829319704,2.640097787510554,5.3509388313256645,2.886778509330039,2.983093497946387,3.121829110937649,3.439602492783994,3.7297814454343623,3.6016814428070463,3.857614816944247,3.969732115064953,4.186539847930077,4.573751515728891,4.944927550358424,4.706176101378222,4.900964426937307,5.00274712124725,10.645380111834504,5.390512652256013,5.521540914662417,6.101359409915359,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.614842553485934E-4,2.6125254093050906E-4,2.613170462009932E-4,2.6126451311592566E-4,2.6128923870304393E-4,2.6125110046281363E-4,2.6133235318208815E-4,2.612122305600345E-4,2.6125259614356286E-4,2.615225723922474E-4,2.635976778853436E-4,2.612530276652936E-4,2.615004507919945E-4,2.6152769462736616E-4,2.6140888942435516E-4,2.6126554219902873E-4,2.613554276499345E-4,2.614784224027242E-4,2.612790302124763E-4,2.612780749504186E-4,2.615131342971645E-4,2.613042523460796E-4,2.613046478074202E-4,2.6147204236255054E-4,2.6127912446240154E-4,2.6153082052883005E-4,2.613445085516978E-4,2.6125195540935606E-4,2.6137039588135545E-4,2.6145016989374847E-4,2.6130553408572853E-4,2.614454836394503E-4,2.615738468449778E-4,2.6181662793414343E-4,2.6134405694103966E-4,2.612653837373357E-4,2.6135958466286935E-4,2.612919176768644E-4,2.612125093556706E-4,2.6127894929861247E-4,2.6154079545573887E-4,2.613973238661973E-4,2.614460794286615E-4,2.6122550987310426E-4,2.612790157352304E-4,2.61265285491576E-4,2.61353721421908E-4,2.613990404838676E-4,2.613458864660951E-4,2.613044626813575E-4,2.6126593158055125E-4,2.618012230454301E-4,2.613316736148884E-4,2.612789558504117E-4,2.613302740869844E-4,2.612522227056215E-4,0.979351423393872,2.612929824151941E-4,2.6126629836447935E-4,2.6125207357619035E-4,2.6146108150200127E-4,2.6135612446964116E-4,2.612519643659639E-4,2.6122540344392456E-4,2.6119913434406614E-4,2.6143529970892377E-4,2.612647629108958E-4,2.61383524154623E-4,2.614602335926059E-4,2.613416141725104E-4,2.612793019057334E-4,2.612257458930213E-4,2.6129257226530084E-4,2.612256051935992E-4,2.6123931389089377E-4,2.61225753286361E-4,2.61395325304E-4,2.6131752568997924E-4,2.612523130700908E-4,2.6127762025432313E-4]}}
{"value":"\"Paula, I may be a bitch, but I'll never be a butch!\" <br /><br />A hilarious line in an otherwise rather tiresome skin flick which features a pretty honey in Stacey Walker, but that's about all. This gal's a real tease who lures her boyfriends, co-workers and even her lesbian roommate Paula into her bedroom, but then turns into a whack job who cries \"rape\" and calls for the police! <br /><br />The schizophrenic personality of this certified c**t is interesting for maybe a little while, but this story ultimately turns into a real repetitive one-note affair. At least the ending is worth the wait, for those who will still care by that time.","finished_norm":["paula","i","mai","be","a","bitch","but","i","will","never","be","a","butch","br","br","a","hilari","line","in","a","otherwis","rather","tiresom","skin","flick","which","featur","a","pretti","honei","in","stacei","walker","but","that","about","all","thi","gal","a","real","teas","who","lure","her","boyfriend","cowork","and","even","her","lesbian","roommat","paula","into","her","bedroom","but","then","turn","into","a","whack","job","who","cry","rape","and","call","for","the","polic","br","br","the","schizophren","person","of","thi","certifi","ct","be","interest","for","mayb","a","littl","while","but","thi","stori","ultim","turn","into","a","real","repetit","onenot","affair","at","littl","the","end","be","worth","the","wait","for","that","who","will","still","care","by","that","time"],"filtered":["paula","mai","bitch","never","butch","br","br","hilari","line","otherwis","rather","tiresom","skin","flick","featur","pretti","honei","stacei","walker","thi","gal","real","teas","lure","boyfriend","cowork","even","lesbian","roommat","paula","bedroom","turn","whack","job","cry","rape","call","polic","br","br","schizophren","person","thi","certifi","ct","interest","mayb","littl","thi","stori","ultim","turn","real","repetit","onenot","affair","littl","end","worth","wait","still","care","time"],"filtered2":["paula","mai","bitch","never","butch","hilari","line","otherwis","rather","tiresom","skin","flick","featur","pretti","honei","stacei","walker","gal","real","teas","lure","boyfriend","cowork","even","lesbian","roommat","paula","bedroom","turn","whack","job","cry","rape","call","polic","schizophren","person","certifi","ct","interest","mayb","littl","stori","ultim","turn","real","repetit","onenot","affair","littl","end","worth","wait","still","care","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,8,14,17,24,42,46,60,64,78,80,96,107,142,153,160,163,205,219,257,289,305,331,471,627,632,735,746,856,1050,1201,1239,1617,1835,2387,2908,2918,2919,3049,3466,3721,3733,3793,3802,4505,4841,5279,6343,7360],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,8,14,17,24,42,46,60,64,78,80,96,107,142,153,160,163,205,219,257,289,305,331,471,627,632,735,746,856,1050,1201,1239,1617,1835,2387,2908,2918,2919,3049,3466,3721,3733,3793,3802,4505,4841,5279,6343,7360],"values":[0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,2.2350163994518417,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.6219954307453837,1.655771293751733,1.838176641236591,1.883428577602134,2.0064197866819473,3.9903607800925114,4.078141625743051,2.1439533986393955,2.2844323215331563,2.3409902041158843,2.3722295531801256,2.4000574358028657,2.571852579609833,2.5792094178355414,2.7602659523229094,2.8282659991423613,2.8612813773965557,2.932274249550174,3.496027715008137,3.477726550625732,3.541919708264792,3.7132521434831514,4.00861390260916,3.900174431363043,4.240607069200353,4.315570107673808,4.573751515728891,4.662879295624898,4.828393734102471,5.089758498236879,5.426230734858092,5.770002273960917,5.408212229355414,5.541743621979936,5.850044981634453,5.999576715605417,5.719991853386255,5.7446844659766265,5.770002273960917,6.214688095222362,6.543192162194399,6.214688095222362,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651717E-4,2.316691787225998E-4,2.317263796324287E-4,2.3167979521786182E-4,2.3170172096235688E-4,2.3166790136863882E-4,2.3173995330228226E-4,2.3163343296338695E-4,2.3166922768351242E-4,2.3190863272655847E-4,2.3374876022784935E-4,2.3166961034116852E-4,2.3188901610218283E-4,2.3191317493693838E-4,2.3180782283696837E-4,2.3168070777104303E-4,2.3176041489471845E-4,2.3186948213389045E-4,2.3169266844704975E-4,2.316918213556661E-4,2.3190026336973317E-4,2.3171503451076993E-4,2.317153851913936E-4,2.3186382454808488E-4,2.316927520244293E-4,2.3191594687179618E-4,2.3175073223857324E-4,2.3166865950389993E-4,2.3177368817377578E-4,2.3184442884434947E-4,2.3171617111051646E-4,2.318402732457831E-4,2.3195410103209608E-4,2.3216939040434886E-4,2.3175033176679253E-4,2.3168056725302106E-4,2.317641011814398E-4,2.317040965781599E-4,2.3163368018913952E-4,2.316925966956007E-4,2.3192479227141053E-4,2.3179756692385698E-4,2.3184080156982067E-4,2.3164520857154724E-4,2.3169265560915865E-4,2.31680480132282E-4,2.3175890187423557E-4,2.3179908915749517E-4,2.317519541225619E-4,2.3171522102838585E-4,2.3168105306030687E-4,2.3215572991360756E-4,2.3173935068699478E-4,2.3169260250549613E-4,2.3173810963694047E-4,2.3166889653243207E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908934E-4,2.3168137831085217E-4,2.3166876428991793E-4,2.3185410485865144E-4,2.3176103280889675E-4,2.3166866744629155E-4,2.3164511419405116E-4,2.3162181971902597E-4,2.3183124250942034E-4,2.316800167268867E-4,2.3178532984537487E-4,2.3185335296367442E-4,2.3174816560918516E-4,2.3169290937467293E-4,

Some of the things at the reunion were too much to capture--like the lady singing--i felt like i was almost watching a spiritual song show here! come on Perry, you can do better then this!","finished_norm":["i","see","the","movi","last","night","here","at","home","but","i","think","it","be","too","long","of","all","the","thing","i","see","in","the","movi","be","wai","too","out","of","text","to","even","have","in","thi","what","i","think","be","go","to","be","a","comedi","typ","movi","like","the","rest","befor","the","thing","be","not","funni","in","the","movi","fiancé","hit","hi","girlfriend","beat","the","movi","be","wai","too","longtalk","about","want","to","go","to","sleep","and","wonder","when","it","will","end","when","you","wake","up","and","still","have","it","plai","some","of","the","thing","at","the","reunion","be","too","much","to","capturelik","the","ladi","singingi","feel","like","i","be","almost","watch","a","spiritu","song","show","here","come","on","perri","you","can","do","well","then","thi"],"filtered":["see","movi","last","night","home","think","long","thing","see","movi","wai","text","even","thi","think","go","comedi","typ","movi","like","rest","befor","thing","funni","movi","fiancé","hit","hi","girlfriend","beat","movi","wai","longtalk","want","go","sleep","wonder","end","wake","still","plai","thing","reunion","much","capturelik","ladi","singingi","feel","like","almost","watch","spiritu","song","show","come","perri","well","thi"],"filtered2":["see","last","night","home","think","long","thing","see","wai","text","even","think","go","comedi","typ","like","rest","befor","thing","funni","fiancé","hit","girlfriend","beat","wai","longtalk","want","go","sleep","wonder","end","wake","still","plai","thing","reunion","capturelik","ladi","singingi","feel","like","almost","watch","spiritu","song","show","come","perri","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,7,12,20,24,28,29,33,34,37,40,43,62,64,79,99,127,131,144,175,210,226,302,328,384,388,472,678,730,732,1368,2161,2444,3053,3451,4320],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,5,6,7,12,20,24,28,29,33,34,37,40,43,62,64,79,99,127,131,144,175,210,226,302,328,384,388,472,678,730,732,1368,2161,2444,3053,3451,4320],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,2.133457220525776,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,3.9586154332014196,2.803707089537043,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,2.0226120445069267,1.883428577602134,1.9469506069506084,2.056430207256609,2.4359679371086367,2.2512118082053005,2.2931108769894046,2.3791142619576227,2.687151791517189,2.5940874818617203,2.902686292364678,3.1550424959247185,3.109204957709252,3.0914425013694116,3.4222967456864013,3.6715125373103863,3.767137231978131,3.7099788181381825,4.390138803171316,5.143104478942172,5.408212229355414,5.626901430320244,5.770002273960917,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.614842553485937E-4,2.612525409305094E-4,2.6131704620099356E-4,2.61264513115926E-4,2.612892387030443E-4,2.6125110046281395E-4,2.613323531820885E-4,2.6121223056003486E-4,2.612525961435632E-4,2.6152257239224773E-4,2.6359767788534396E-4,2.6125302766529397E-4,2.615004507919949E-4,2.6152769462736654E-4,2.6140888942435554E-4,2.6126554219902906E-4,2.613554276499349E-4,2.6147842240272455E-4,2.612790302124766E-4,2.6127807495041896E-4,2.615131342971648E-4,2.6130425234608E-4,2.6130464780742057E-4,2.614720423625509E-4,2.612791244624019E-4,2.6153082052883037E-4,2.613445085516982E-4,2.612519554093564E-4,2.613703958813558E-4,2.6145016989374885E-4,2.613055340857289E-4,2.6144548363945066E-4,2.6157384684497817E-4,2.6181662793414376E-4,2.6134405694104E-4,2.61265383737336E-4,2.6135958466286973E-4,2.6129191767686476E-4,2.612125093556709E-4,2.6127894929861285E-4,2.615407954557392E-4,2.613973238661976E-4,2.614460794286618E-4,2.6122550987310464E-4,2.612790157352308E-4,2.612652854915764E-4,2.613537214219083E-4,2.6139904048386794E-4,2.613458864660954E-4,2.6130446268135787E-4,2.612659315805516E-4,2.6180122304543047E-4,2.613316736148887E-4,2.6127895585041205E-4,2.6133027408698476E-4,2.6125222270562186E-4,0.979351423393872,2.612929824151945E-4,2.6126629836447973E-4,2.612520735761907E-4,2.6146108150200165E-4,2.6135612446964154E-4,2.6125196436596425E-4,2.612254034439249E-4,2.611991343440665E-4,2.6143529970892415E-4,2.6126476291089617E-4,2.6138352415462337E-4,2.614602335926063E-4,2.6134161417251076E-4,2.6127930190573376E-4,2.6122574589302163E-4,2.612925722653012E-4,2.612256051935996E-4,2.612393138908941E-4,2.6122575328636137E-4,2.6139532530400036E-4,2.6131752568997956E-4,2.612523130700912E-4,2.612776202543235E-4]}}
{"value":"AntiTrust could have been a great vehicle for Rachael Leigh Cook, but the director cut out her best scenes. In the scenes that she are in, she is just a zombie. She is involved in a sub-plot that is simular to a sub-plot in \"Get Carter\", but she handles the sub-plot better in \"Get Carter\".(I blame the director) The director's homage to Hitchcock was corny. (It's the scene were Ryan Philippe's charactor realizes he may not be able to trust Tim Robbin's charactor, at least I think it's a homage to Hitchcock. The DVD shows the scenes that were cut out. I think the director should have trust his instincts and not listen to the test audiences.","finished_norm":["antitrust","can","have","be","a","great","vehicl","for","rachael","leigh","cook","but","the","director","cut","out","her","well","scene","in","the","scene","that","she","be","in","she","be","just","a","zombi","she","be","involv","in","a","subplot","that","be","simular","to","a","subplot","in","get","carter","but","she","handl","the","subplot","well","in","get","carteri","blame","the","director","the","director","homag","to","hitchcock","be","corni","it","the","scene","be","ryan","philipp","charactor","realiz","he","mai","not","be","abl","to","trust","tim","robbin","charactor","at","littl","i","think","it","a","homag","to","hitchcock","the","dvd","show","the","scene","that","be","cut","out","i","think","the","director","should","have","trust","hi","instinct","and","not","listen","to","the","test","audienc"],"filtered":["antitrust","great","vehicl","rachael","leigh","cook","director","cut","well","scene","scene","zombi","involv","subplot","simular","subplot","get","carter","handl","subplot","well","get","carteri","blame","director","director","homag","hitchcock","corni","scene","ryan","philipp","charactor","realiz","mai","abl","trust","tim","robbin","charactor","littl","think","homag","hitchcock","dvd","show","scene","cut","think","director","trust","hi","instinct","listen","test","audienc"],"filtered2":["antitrust","great","vehicl","rachael","leigh","cook","director","cut","well","scene","scene","zombi","involv","subplot","simular","subplot","get","carter","handl","subplot","well","get","carteri","blame","director","director","homag","hitchcock","corni","scene","ryan","philipp","charactor","realiz","mai","abl","trust","tim","robbin","charactor","littl","think","homag","hitchcock","dvd","show","scene","cut","think","director","trust","instinct","listen","test","audienc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,12,14,19,20,28,46,51,58,168,241,247,268,303,405,454,845,898,945,1290,1306,1408,1423,1444,1485,2229,2293,2385,2496,3005,3389,3401,3418],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,12,14,19,20,28,46,51,58,168,241,247,268,303,405,454,845,898,945,1290,1306,1408,1423,1444,1485,2229,2293,2385,2496,3005,3389,3401,3418],"values":[1.5932680941439847,2.133457220525776,1.1175081997259209,5.24952271204694,2.330690080046114,1.5452294193519092,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,7.462805258506724,2.4894767118610357,2.6627744961815836,2.7303758068497004,3.6746621462132825,5.736597900110404,3.109204957709252,3.2556198060399626,3.831445099210862,3.892300374932137,3.9782428047328615,8.667394984532729,4.499089986959872,13.454412089137184,4.470719289830655,4.798834931860927,4.566029469634981,5.116075806554253,5.089758498236879,10.258997653772786,10.781025304512026,5.649374286172302,5.967828017290836,6.0662680901040895,5.7446844659766265]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278283E-4,2.505862069158131E-4,2.5064807858603353E-4,2.5059769030472617E-4,2.5062140640359234E-4,2.505848252590656E-4,2.506627606186685E-4,2.505475423240713E-4,2.5058625987464623E-4,2.5084521362060507E-4,2.5283559737960344E-4,2.505866737783477E-4,2.508239951938731E-4,2.508501267267696E-4,2.507361720640576E-4,2.505986773727581E-4,2.5068489300962495E-4,2.5080286617253593E-4,2.506116147019669E-4,2.506106984410387E-4,2.5083616086100734E-4,2.506358070744792E-4,2.506361863900524E-4,2.507967466145734E-4,2.5061170510388677E-4,2.5085312500494226E-4,2.5067441971278985E-4,2.5058564530012784E-4,2.506992501229477E-4,2.5077576714783415E-4,2.506370364836774E-4,2.507712722224066E-4,2.5089439465660816E-4,2.511272635582013E-4,2.5067398654034516E-4,2.505985253806876E-4,2.506888803013838E-4,2.5062397600113847E-4,2.5054780973712956E-4,2.5061153709162804E-4,2.508626926787702E-4,2.507250787007574E-4,2.5077184368692913E-4,2.505602794736536E-4,2.506116008157933E-4,2.50598431146074E-4,2.5068325644292286E-4,2.5072672523291815E-4,2.5067574137014497E-4,2.506360088222566E-4,2.5059905085673804E-4,2.5111248761528843E-4,2.50662108796618E-4,2.5061154337593255E-4,2.506607664081854E-4,2.5058590168330804E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867695E-4,2.5059940266573095E-4,2.50585758642485E-4,2.507862332604839E-4,2.5068556137980256E-4,2.505856538910582E-4,2.5056017738972995E-4,2.5053498079616126E-4,2.507615040780929E-4,2.505979299011483E-4,2.507118423993319E-4,2.507854199692584E-4,2.506716435043772E-4,2.506118753026198E-4,2.5056050585742603E-4,2.506246038642505E-4,2.505603709024343E-4,2.505735199054816E-4,2.505605129489129E-4,2.507231617352093E-4,2.5064853849859876E-4,2.5058598835840613E-4,2.5061026230912794E-4]}}
{"value":"The only redeeming quality of this film is the actual storyline...Otherwise, this movie was terrible. The acting was ridiculously bad, and the set design was cheesy and very tacky. The story was decent, but it was very hard to watch due to all the horrid acting.

Some of the editing was well done, but there are continuity errors all over the place...I'm just starting to get sick and tired of watching gay movies that are bad...Can we get a good one soon?","finished_norm":["the","onli","redeem","qualiti","of","thi","film","be","the","actual","storylineotherwis","thi","movi","be","terribl","the","act","be","ridicul","bad","and","the","set","design","be","cheesi","and","veri","tacki","the","stori","be","decent","but","it","be","veri","hard","to","watch","due","to","all","the","horrid","act","i","would","not","recommend","watch","thi","oneth","onli","redeem","qualiti","of","thi","film","be","that","the","actor","be","somewhat","attractiveespeci","ryan","bauer","the","man","who","plai","the","soap","opu","star","some","of","the","edit","be","good","do","but","there","be","continu","error","all","over","the","placeim","just","start","to","get","sick","and","tire","of","watch","gai","movi","that","be","badcan","we","get","a","good","on","soon"],"filtered":["onli","redeem","qualiti","thi","film","actual","storylineotherwis","thi","movi","terribl","act","ridicul","bad","set","design","cheesi","veri","tacki","stori","decent","veri","hard","watch","due","horrid","act","recommend","watch","thi","oneth","onli","redeem","qualiti","thi","film","actor","somewhat","attractiveespeci","ryan","bauer","man","plai","soap","opu","star","edit","good","continu","error","placeim","start","get","sick","tire","watch","gai","movi","badcan","get","good","soon"],"filtered2":["onli","redeem","qualiti","actual","storylineotherwis","terribl","act","ridicul","bad","set","design","cheesi","veri","tacki","stori","decent","veri","hard","watch","due","horrid","act","recommend","watch","oneth","onli","redeem","qualiti","actor","somewhat","attractiveespeci","ryan","bauer","man","plai","soap","opu","star","edit","good","continu","error","placeim","start","get","sick","tire","watch","gai","badcan","get","good","soon"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,9,11,15,17,21,40,41,45,52,71,100,109,166,171,274,298,309,319,348,433,449,543,568,596,634,640,681,778,900,1200,1343,1898,1911,2229,3034,7814],"values":[2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,9,11,15,17,21,40,41,45,52,71,100,109,166,171,274,298,309,319,348,433,449,543,568,596,634,640,681,778,900,1200,1343,1898,1911,2229,3034,7814],"values":[1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,2.8828493162168796,1.0683570856722073,1.982619630677639,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,2.324031090670098,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.8162961064622165,1.7122153074726136,1.9214926742550966,2.1405462403177813,2.125691139326857,2.4423870329693536,2.373087554090762,2.748952192422636,2.7819920465008363,2.848772527704847,5.811212004936025,3.0103169565570433,3.164467636384302,3.2597778161886266,3.477726550625732,3.4471119148061256,3.485528930909917,7.0239710008934955,3.9998419165363233,3.706716172503366,3.8059428063999263,3.9201351739255808,4.499089986959872,4.520909034354511,4.848596441419991,4.890269137820559,5.116075806554253,5.463272006538442,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278305E-4,2.5058620691581333E-4,2.5064807858603375E-4,2.5059769030472644E-4,2.506214064035926E-4,2.505848252590658E-4,2.5066276061866876E-4,2.5054754232407155E-4,2.505862598746465E-4,2.5084521362060534E-4,2.528355973796037E-4,2.5058667377834796E-4,2.508239951938734E-4,2.5085012672676986E-4,2.507361720640579E-4,2.5059867737275835E-4,2.5068489300962516E-4,2.5080286617253615E-4,2.5061161470196715E-4,2.5061069844103896E-4,2.508361608610076E-4,2.5063580707447943E-4,2.506361863900527E-4,2.507967466145737E-4,2.50611705103887E-4,2.5085312500494253E-4,2.506744197127901E-4,2.505856453001281E-4,2.5069925012294797E-4,2.507757671478344E-4,2.506370364836777E-4,2.507712722224069E-4,2.508943946566084E-4,2.5112726355820155E-4,2.5067398654034543E-4,2.505985253806879E-4,2.5068888030138403E-4,2.5062397600113874E-4,2.505478097371298E-4,2.506115370916283E-4,2.508626926787705E-4,2.5072507870075764E-4,2.507718436869294E-4,2.505602794736539E-4,2.506116008157935E-4,2.505984311460743E-4,2.5068325644292313E-4,2.507267252329184E-4,2.5067574137014524E-4,2.506360088222568E-4,2.505990508567383E-4,2.511124876152887E-4,2.506621087966182E-4,2.506115433759328E-4,2.5066076640818566E-4,2.505859016833083E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.506249972686772E-4,2.5059940266573117E-4,2.505857586424852E-4,2.507862332604842E-4,2.5068556137980284E-4,2.505856538910585E-4,2.505601773897302E-4,2.5053498079616153E-4,2.507615040780932E-4,2.5059792990114857E-4,2.507118423993322E-4,2.5078541996925865E-4,2.506716435043775E-4,2.506118753026201E-4,2.505605058574263E-4,2.506246038642508E-4,2.5056037090243457E-4,2.505735199054818E-4,2.505605129489131E-4,2.507231617352096E-4,2.50648538498599E-4,2.505859883584064E-4,2.506102623091282E-4]}}

{"value":"Even worse than the worst David Lynch \"confusathon\", \"Brain Dead\" makes no sense whatsoever. Shamefully wasted talent (Bill Pullman, Bill Paxton), bounce around like they are in a \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon on acid. There is negligible character development. It simply starts climbing the \"strange scale\", until climaxing in total chaos. Do not get sucked into this because of the above fine actors.

{"value":"This is one of those films that I could only sit through once. Charlotte Henry is fine -- in fact, all the actors were fine. The problem was in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Granted, this was 1933, but it really creaked. Part of the problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming). The movie just clumped along with no cohesion. Much of Lewis Carrols spirit, humor and continuity are missing. What a pity! It's such a great book. I would recommend Disney's 1951 version.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","that","film","that","i","can","onli","sit","through","onc","charlott","henri","be","fine","in","fact","all","the","actor","be","fine","the","problem","be","in","the","script","the","dialog","the","direct","the","edit","the","set","and","the","special","effect","grant","thi","be","but","it","realli","creak","part","of","the","problem","be","that","actor","like","richard","arlen","gari","cooper","wc","field","and","cari","grant","be","not","recogniz","there","face","cry","for","a","recognit","that","be","not","forthcom","the","movi","just","clump","along","with","no","cohes","much","of","lewi","carrol","spirit","humor","and","continu","be","miss","what","a","piti","it","such","a","great","book","i","would","recommend","disnei","version"],"filtered":["thi","film","onli","sit","onc","charlott","henri","fine","fact","actor","fine","problem","script","dialog","direct","edit","set","special","effect","grant","thi","realli","creak","part","problem","actor","like","richard","arlen","gari","cooper","wc","field","cari","grant","recogniz","face","cry","recognit","forthcom","movi","clump","along","cohes","much","lewi","carrol","spirit","humor","continu","miss","piti","great","book","recommend","disnei","version"],"filtered2":["onli","sit","onc","charlott","henri","fine","fact","actor","fine","problem","script","dialog","direct","edit","set","special","effect","grant","realli","creak","part","problem","actor","like","richard","arlen","gari","cooper","wc","field","cari","grant","recogniz","face","cry","recognit","forthcom","clump","along","cohes","lewi","carrol","spirit","humor","continu","miss","piti","great","book","recommend","disnei","version"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,11,13,41,51,61,77,97,102,106,109,151,167,203,220,236,244,251,255,298,324,348,369,432,433,464,641,841,856,894,1066,1266,1282,1612,1726,2237,2285,3750,3932,4371,4420,5486,8084,8122],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,11,13,41,51,61,77,97,102,106,109,151,167,203,220,236,244,251,255,298,324,348,369,432,433,464,641,841,856,894,1066,1266,1282,1612,1726,2237,2285,3750,3932,4371,4420,5486,8084,8122],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,3.1375198335242067,1.7139899308309823,1.8818517047392527,1.9463902258768238,2.0545557924622586,2.087553710177271,2.159084361316692,2.125691139326857,2.8002454868101863,4.9219153375776195,2.569760528637609,2.8336934208777267,2.617923930016232,2.634508058031767,2.6942272927333892,2.6754694156628323,2.7819920465008363,2.8753661172782943,3.0103169565570433,3.121829110937649,3.235085203598255,3.164467636384302,6.5744693248433315,3.7034641371169887,4.30366520516749,3.900174431363043,4.091229668125752,8.619199881374609,4.327618446189983,4.449957298382227,5.02684467282631,4.911775343041523,5.322690055917252,5.390512652256013,6.0662680901040895,5.9370563586240825,5.9370563586240825,5.9370563586240825,6.255510089742618,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.508084609727828E-4,2.5058620691581306E-4,2.506480785860335E-4,2.5059769030472617E-4,2.506214064035923E-4,2.5058482525906555E-4,2.506627606186685E-4,2.5054754232407123E-4,2.505862598746462E-4,2.5084521362060507E-4,2.528355973796034E-4,2.505866737783477E-4,2.5082399519387306E-4,2.508501267267696E-4,2.5073617206405755E-4,2.50598677372758E-4,2.506848930096249E-4,2.508028661725359E-4,2.506116147019668E-4,2.5061069844103863E-4,2.508361608610073E-4,2.5063580707447916E-4,2.5063618639005236E-4,2.5079674661457335E-4,2.506117051038867E-4,2.508531250049422E-4,2.5067441971278985E-4,2.505856453001278E-4,2.506992501229477E-4,2.507757671478341E-4,2.506370364836774E-4,2.507712722224066E-4,2.508943946566081E-4,2.511272635582012E-4,2.5067398654034516E-4,2.505985253806876E-4,2.5068888030138376E-4,2.506239760011384E-4,2.505478097371295E-4,2.5061153709162804E-4,2.5086269267877016E-4,2.507250787007573E-4,2.507718436869291E-4,2.505602794736536E-4,2.5061160081579325E-4,2.5059843114607396E-4,2.506832564429228E-4,2.507267252329181E-4,2.506757413701449E-4,2.5063600882225655E-4,2.5059905085673804E-4,2.511124876152884E-4,2.5066210879661795E-4,2.506115433759325E-4,2.506607664081854E-4,2.50585901683308E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867695E-4,2.505994026657309E-4,2.5058575864248493E-4,2.507862332604839E-4,2.506855613798025E-4,2.5058565389105816E-4,2.505601773897299E-4,2.5053498079616126E-4,2.507615040780929E-4,2.505979299011483E-4,2.5071184239933186E-4,2.507854199692583E-4,2.5067164350437717E-4,2.5061187530261975E-4,2.50560505857426E-4,2.506246038642505E-4,2.505603709024343E-4,2.5057351990548154E-4,2.505605129489128E-4,2.5072316173520927E-4,2.506485384985987E-4,2.505859883584061E-4,2.5061026230912794E-4]}}
{"value":"Just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home. She then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why.<br /><br />This is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn't quite. I can't really put my finger on why it didn't work but it was good enough that I kind of wished it was better, or at least had gotten the little things right- like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size. I think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong.","finished_norm":["just","okai","film","about","a","woman","who","be","a","twin","have","disturb","vision","of","her","sister","in","danger","back","at","home","she","then","return","home","to","find","all","be","not","good","and","that","she","be","go","to","have","to","find","out","what","happen","to","her","sister","and","whybr","br","thi","be","the","sort","of","thing","that","kind","of","almost","work","but","doe","not","quit","i","ca","not","realli","put","my","finger","on","why","it","do","not","work","but","it","be","good","enough","that","i","kind","of","wish","it","be","well","or","at","littl","have","get","the","littl","thing","right","like","have","the","girl","who","plai","the","twin","in","the","flashback","be","close","in","size","i","think","perhap","that","what","wrong","with","it","there","be","lot","of","littl","thing","that","just","be","wrong"],"filtered":["okai","film","woman","twin","disturb","vision","sister","danger","back","home","return","home","find","good","go","find","happen","sister","whybr","br","thi","sort","thing","kind","almost","work","doe","quit","ca","realli","put","finger","work","good","enough","kind","wish","well","littl","get","littl","thing","right","like","girl","plai","twin","flashback","close","size","think","perhap","wrong","lot","littl","thing","wrong"],"filtered2":["okai","woman","twin","disturb","vision","sister","danger","back","home","return","home","find","good","go","find","happen","sister","whybr","sort","thing","kind","almost","work","doe","quit","ca","realli","put","finger","work","good","enough","kind","wish","well","littl","get","littl","thing","right","like","girl","plai","twin","flashback","close","size","think","perhap","wrong","lot","littl","thing","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,12,13,14,18,20,25,29,38,40,48,63,70,72,81,84,93,94,120,121,122,131,159,191,269,295,302,318,399,488,585,839,978,1051,1510,1718,1905,2191,4690],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,12,13,14,18,20,25,29,38,40,48,63,70,72,81,84,93,94,120,121,122,131,159,191,269,295,302,318,399,488,585,839,978,1051,1510,1718,1905,2191,4690],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,3.3525245991777624,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,2.559277576165403,3.9586154332014196,3.038623282696244,1.6284968758320737,3.3910232448024944,1.8729627573220065,2.094675786251684,1.9209463754160525,1.949757232424728,2.2212694515902225,2.035389827120098,2.08112281984698,2.2044500422972613,2.2190595059394194,4.497869534746497,2.2512118082053005,2.300267965194495,2.5460113484259455,2.76533567167316,2.7910771187233068,5.805372584729356,2.902686292364678,3.129115117668582,3.3933092088131493,7.433072437368683,3.965503778955432,4.058285512406398,4.191816905030921,4.597282013139085,9.845408827147427,4.85885294158718,5.014723312293965,6.032366538428407]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164655E-4,2.232427581278421E-4,2.232978784893336E-4,2.2325298847309999E-4,2.2327411672029313E-4,2.2324152723462217E-4,2.2331095844892396E-4,2.2320831253640845E-4,2.2324280530791686E-4,2.2347350255652804E-4,2.2524669975505118E-4,2.232431740473022E-4,2.2345459944064997E-4,2.234778795547062E-4,2.2337635938917728E-4,2.2325386783430908E-4,2.2333067579914E-4,2.2343577597443482E-4,2.2326539346890378E-4,2.2326457718847362E-4,2.2346543761534018E-4,2.2328694601974757E-4,2.232872839451897E-4,2.2343032416998442E-4,2.2326547400635307E-4,2.2348055066696387E-4,2.2332134532680108E-4,2.2324225779449922E-4,2.233434662939417E-4,2.2341163393927872E-4,2.23288041278356E-4,2.2340762949082018E-4,2.235173170595689E-4,2.2372477578809865E-4,2.233209594212379E-4,2.2325373242729912E-4,2.2333422800586625E-4,2.232764059286679E-4,2.232085507699067E-4,2.2326532432724466E-4,2.234890743360058E-4,2.233664765107438E-4,2.2340813859831552E-4,2.2321965983456365E-4,2.2326538109796072E-4,2.2325364847537168E-4,2.2332921781121273E-4,2.2336794337671957E-4,2.2332252276763823E-4,2.2328712575322464E-4,2.232542005644894E-4,2.237116121655258E-4,2.2331037775234788E-4,2.2326532992581884E-4,2.2330918184256554E-4,2.232424862016769E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760417E-4,2.2325451398481235E-4,2.2324235876917267E-4,2.2342095801135584E-4,2.2333127123814577E-4,2.2324226544800504E-4,2.2321956888982664E-4,2.2319712169645184E-4,2.2339892722621741E-4,2.2325320192525592E-4,2.2335468452716256E-4,2.2342023346478724E-4,2.2331887205251033E-4,2.2326562563335225E-4,2.2321986151580686E-4,2.2327696528065536E-4,2.2321974128682482E-4,2.2323145549784634E-4,2.232198678334853E-4,2.2336476872051285E-4,2.232982882171906E-4,2.232425634189675E-4,2.2326418864637525E-4]}}
{"value":"The movie had a lot of potential, unfortunately, it came apart because of a weak/implausible story line, miscasting, and general lack of content/substance. One of the very obvious flaws was that Sean Connery, who played an Arab man, didn't know how to pronounce his own Arab name! This may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details. The quality of acting was uniformly well below average. <br /><br />Movie's solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end; and a french song (I don't recall the title). Overall, it was a pretty bad movie where Sean Connery was visibly miscast.","finished_norm":["the","movi","have","a","lot","of","potenti","unfortun","it","come","apart","becaus","of","a","weakimplaus","stori","line","miscast","and","gener","lack","of","contentsubst","on","of","the","veri","obviou","flaw","be","that","sean","conneri","who","plai","a","arab","man","do","not","know","how","to","pronounc","hi","own","arab","name","thi","mai","seem","a","small","flaw","but","it","point","to","the","seem","lack","of","effort","in","pai","attent","to","detail","the","qualiti","of","act","be","uniformli","good","below","averag","br","br","movi","solitari","save","grace","be","the","twist","in","the","plot","at","the","veri","end","and","a","french","song","i","do","not","recal","the","titl","overal","it","be","a","pretti","bad","movi","where","sean","conneri","be","visibli","miscast"],"filtered":["movi","lot","potenti","unfortun","come","apart","becaus","weakimplaus","stori","line","miscast","gener","lack","contentsubst","veri","obviou","flaw","sean","conneri","plai","arab","man","know","pronounc","hi","arab","name","thi","mai","seem","small","flaw","point","seem","lack","effort","pai","attent","detail","qualiti","act","uniformli","good","averag","br","br","movi","solitari","save","grace","twist","plot","veri","end","french","song","recal","titl","overal","pretti","bad","movi","sean","conneri","visibli","miscast"],"filtered2":["lot","potenti","unfortun","come","apart","becaus","weakimplaus","stori","line","miscast","gener","lack","contentsubst","veri","obviou","flaw","sean","conneri","plai","arab","man","know","pronounc","arab","name","mai","seem","small","flaw","point","seem","lack","effort","pai","attent","detail","qualiti","act","uniformli","good","averag","solitari","save","grace","twist","plot","veri","end","french","song","recal","titl","overal","pretti","bad","sean","conneri","visibli","miscast"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,15,17,21,22,24,26,32,34,35,40,45,46,66,72,78,107,143,183,189,225,227,264,319,322,328,363,383,401,412,435,547,572,636,643,740,899,923,1149,1459,1541,1703,2855,3623,4161,5176,7797],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,9,15,17,21,22,24,26,32,34,35,40,45,46,66,72,78,107,143,183,189,225,227,264,319,322,328,363,383,401,412,435,547,572,636,643,740,899,923,1149,1459,1541,1703,2855,3623,4161,5176,7797],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.0683570856722073,2.4001215597131385,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,2.926338025798268,1.6284968758320737,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.929723173391612,1.9209463754160525,2.0064197866819473,2.1439533986393955,2.3409902041158843,4.977025712729459,2.498193474075453,2.641219492619754,2.6005321873043625,2.757740698455715,2.9056060024680126,2.885344817328191,3.1550424959247185,3.0349689855553557,3.0433232530252132,3.0879275592619675,3.107414446935464,3.2829611516442836,3.432149042129413,3.4933926673701317,3.530930586689197,3.5813614403160887,3.7165362186843414,4.197121957260614,7.982292419137539,4.297765483040301,9.867508499520596,9.210500365576523,4.6973654716960676,11.591955520728355,12.429376190444724,5.878215858601149,6.1754673820690815,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247373E-4,2.1540780663324E-4,2.154609924846839E-4,2.1541767793321667E-4,2.1543806466120755E-4,2.1540661893957894E-4,2.154736133886265E-4,2.1537456994793322E-4,2.1540785215747783E-4,2.1563045283100655E-4,2.1734141771275798E-4,2.1540820795554666E-4,2.1561221314088632E-4,2.1563467621359283E-4,2.1553671901055065E-4,2.154185264322716E-4,2.1549263873663006E-4,2.1559405030503607E-4,2.1542964756197328E-4,2.1542885992980758E-4,2.1562267093784917E-4,2.154504437022089E-4,2.1545076976778392E-4,2.1558878983769233E-4,2.154297252728717E-4,2.1563725358021167E-4,2.15483635727537E-4,2.1540732385964915E-4,2.155049803348709E-4,2.1557075556130395E-4,2.1545150052150515E-4,2.1556689165339282E-4,2.1567272961560597E-4,2.1587290735061642E-4,2.1548326336575638E-4,2.1541839577752042E-4,2.1549606627473263E-4,2.1544027352728262E-4,2.153747998203634E-4,2.1542958084691717E-4,2.156454781016617E-4,2.1552718298266588E-4,2.1556738289319757E-4,2.1538551900011E-4,2.1542963562520216E-4,2.154183147719787E-4,2.1549123191840156E-4,2.1552859836735793E-4,2.1548477184478578E-4,2.154506171277408E-4,2.1541884748491825E-4,2.158602057199362E-4,2.1547305307223897E-4,2.1542958624900317E-4,2.154718991342331E-4,2.154075442506243E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476614E-4,2.1541914990540835E-4,2.1540742129050477E-4,2.1557975239475943E-4,2.154932132780454E-4,2.154073312445467E-4,2.153854312471791E-4,2.1536377186288157E-4,2.1555849480439068E-4,2.1541788389403313E-4,2.1551580485178992E-4,2.15579053276954E-4,2.1548124925554286E-4,2.1542987157835368E

{"value":"...the child actors were annoying. Also it seems as if the makers on this film were struggling to fill 90 minutes. Decent death scenes, though. If not for the death scenes, this movie would have a very Disneyish feel to it.<br /><br />The main child protagonist didn't seem nearly as scared as she should have been. If I was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual, you can bet your arse I wouldn't be out wandering around and riding my bike.<br /><br />Overall, I've seen worse
