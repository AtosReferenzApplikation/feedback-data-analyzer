{"value":"This is exactly the type of film that frustrates me the most. Great cast, great director, great story potential, then they ruin it all with a screenplay that goes nowhere...and says nothing while going there! There is no depth here whatsoever. No depth of characters, no depth of plot, no depth of surprise, suspense, or common sense. We know what's happening, we are told how they plan to fix the problem, they fix the problem, throw a surprise at us near the end that fails to generate any suspense, then they end the film abruptly. Wasted opportunity.<br /><br />On the plus side, Glenn Ford leads a cast of UK (and one French) actors who are all fantastic, doing an incredibly impressive job with the one-dimensional writing they were given. One of the absolute favorites is Herbert Walton as \"Old Charlie\", who provides some wonderful bits of humor and warmth to a dark and serious film. I also thought the film had a great look to it...all shadows and fog...very film noir in feel.<br /><br />Even though the actors do the best they can and the directing is enjoyable, it still just isn't enough for me to recommend spending the time to view the film. There are far better Glenn Ford movies out there: The Big Heat, Gilda, Affair in Trinidad, etc.","finished_norm":["thi","be","exactli","the","typ","of","film","that","frustrat","me","the","much","great","cast","great","director","great","stori","potenti","then","thei","ruin","it","all","with","a","screenplai","that","go","nowhereand","sai","noth","while","go","there","there","be","no","depth","here","whatsoev","no","depth","of","charact","no","depth","of","plot","no","depth","of","surpris","suspens","or","common","sens","we","know","what","happen","we","be","tell","how","thei","plan","to","fix","the","problem","thei","fix","the","problem","throw","a","surpris","at","u","near","the","end","that","fail","to","gener","ani","suspens","then","thei","end","the","film","abruptli","wast","opportunitybr","br","on","the","plu","side","glenn","ford","lead","a","cast","of","uk","and","on","french","actor","who","be","all","fantast","do","a","incredibli","impress","job","with","the","onedimension","write","thei","be","give","on","of","the","absolut","favorit","be","herbert","walton","a","old","charli","who","provid","some","wonder","bit","of","humor","and","warmth","to","a","dark","and","seriou","film","i","conjur","think","the","film","have","a","great","look","to","ital","shadow","and","fogveri","film","noir","in","feelbr","br","even","though","the","actor","do","the","well","thei","can","and","the","direct","be","enjoy","it","still","just","be","not","enough","for","me","to","recommend","spend","the","time","to","view","the","film","there","be","far","well","glenn","ford","movi","out","there","the","big","heat","gilda","affair","in","trinidad","etc"],"filtered":["thi","exactli","typ","film","frustrat","much","great","cast","great","director","great","stori","potenti","thei","ruin","screenplai","go","nowhereand","sai","noth","go","depth","whatsoev","depth","charact","depth","plot","depth","surpris","suspens","common","sens","know","happen","tell","thei","plan","fix","problem","thei","fix","problem","throw","surpris","u","near","end","fail","gener","ani","suspens","thei","end","film","abruptli","wast","opportunitybr","br","plu","side","glenn","ford","lead","cast","uk","french","actor","fantast","incredibli","impress","job","onedimension","write","thei","give","absolut","favorit","herbert","walton","old","charli","provid","wonder","bit","humor","warmth","dark","seriou","film","conjur","think","film","great","look","ital","shadow","fogveri","film","noir","feelbr","br","even","though","actor","well","thei","direct","enjoy","still","enough","recommend","spend","time","view","film","far","well","glenn","ford","movi","big","heat","gilda","affair","trinidad","etc"],"filtered2":["exactli","typ","frustrat","great","cast","great","director","great","stori","potenti","ruin","screenplai","go","nowhereand","noth","go","depth","whatsoev","depth","charact","depth","plot","depth","surpris","suspens","common","sens","know","happen","tell","plan","fix","problem","fix","problem","throw","surpris","u","near","end","fail","gener","ani","suspens","end","abruptli","wast","opportunitybr","plu","side","glenn","ford","lead","cast","uk","french","actor","fantast","incredibli","impress","job","onedimension","write","give","absolut","favorit","herbert","walton","old","charli","provid","wonder","bit","humor","warmth","dark","seriou","conjur","think","great","look","ital","shadow","fogveri","noir","feelbr","even","though","actor","well","direct","enjoy","still","enough","recommend","spend","time","view","far","well","glenn","ford","big","heat","gilda","affair","trinidad","etc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,8,10,12,16,17,20,24,26,27,30,32,39,41,49,51,58,64,65,67,82,86,89,90,92,93,94,101,102,112,157,167,173,175,215,222,225,283,289,298,310,312,326,368,369,384,418,425,429,462,493,529,547,555,581,687,695,703,710,737,749,822,899,914,939,991,1201,1366,1382,1392,1489,1666,1768,1837,2182,2539,2693,2884,3376,4050,5999,7482],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,8,10,12,16,17,20,24,26,27,30,32,39,41,49,51,58,64,65,67,82,86,89,90,92,93,94,101,102,112,157,167,173,175,215,222,225,283,289,298,310,312,326,368,369,384,418,425,429,462,493,529,547,555,581,687,695,703,710,737,749,822,899,914,939,991,1201,1366,1382,1392,1489,1666,1768,1837,2182,2539,2693,2884,3376,4050,5999,7482],"values":[0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,2.330690080046114,2.6420723132238515,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,3.1375198335242067,1.6920303308087352,6.855959723323929,1.865701314626681,1.883428577602134,1.9073850067444174,1.9570915389266579,2.0201965843953

{"value":"This film is \"riveting\" but in much the same way a car crash is riveting. It's hard to look away. Overall, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment--and a futile, biased experiment at that. The filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible denominator. The manner in which the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation. The intervening steps that the filmmakers force Ted to participate in (meeting with so-called experts) were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with Ted. Instead, it's painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker's posteriors and to further exploit Ted's situation. The worst part is that the filmmakers stop following Ted after 6 months; and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before. If they had cared, they would have found better \"experts\" to help Ted. If they truly wanted to see what Ted would do, then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention. This film is at best a high-brow Jackass stunt and not a documentary. It's sad to think how much $100,000 could have actually changed a homeless person's life had it been put in the right

{"value":"Well, the big money machine has done it again! Disney very shrewdly takes advantage of morons like myself who feel we must own every video (good or bad) stamped with the Disney moniker. Why is it that I continue to look forward to these \"sequels\" which make Don Bluth on a bad day look like Leonardo DaVinci? Cinderella 2 consists of three storylines (already a poor choice!) Doesn't one of the most endearing Disney creations at least deserve a linear story? Of these three, only the last comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling that I would expect. The music is atrocious and modern (meaning in 2 years it will already be dated) and adds nothing to the story. Why does everything have to be updated? You know, the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style? Gee, I can't wait for a sequel to Sleeping Beauty. Instead of music based on the themes of Tchaikovsky, we'll get music inspired by Britney Spears!!! So Disney, if you're listening, remember we're not all indiscriminate children out here.

{"value":"Dreyfuss plays a mob boss who lost his mind, but now he's \"fixed.\" Lane is his girl who's been messing around with his Number One (Goldblum), who's supposed to have something going with Lane's sister (Barkin).<br /><br />With what anyone could consider an all-star supporting cast (Burt Reynolds, Gabriel Byrne, Kyle MacLachlan and even an appearance by Richard Pryor) can't help this plot, as Dreyfuss proves he's not \"fixed\" and tries to kill just about everyone in sight.<br /><br />You know, it's not like you didn't know what was coming. The first ten minutes were nothing but guys trying to tell Goldblum what was in store for him when Dreyfuss gets out, but I'll save you all the trouble: skip this movie.<br /><br />The actual reason I picked this movie is because I've been on a Diane Lane kick lately and have been trying to see all her movies. The real let-down for me wasn't just the terrible plot, but also the fact that she doesn't show up until the last fifteen minutes of the movie (although we hear about her all through the movie). Even being a fan of over half of the cast can't help me enjoy this film.

{"value":"In the third entry of the Phantasm series, Mike and Reggie continue chasing the Tall Man, assisted by a trigger-happy 9 year old, a black G.I. Jane and the spirit of Mike's deceased brother (he died in the original Phantasm). Number 3 is a rather disappointing sequel, since the gore and black comedy is a lot less inspired and exciting as it was in Phantasm II. I got the feeling the stress was merely laid on Reggie's incompetence as a lover and his talent as stand-up comedian. The humor in the previous film was a lot more dry and oppressed, which fits a story like this better. Also, the settings aren't as macabre here, plus the constant presence of the Tall Man (Agnus Schrim) isn't as obvious There still is plenty of gore but not half as satisfying this time. By the way, beware for the severely cut version as it shows most delightful killings off-screen. The entire Phantasm series is the lifetime achievement of Don Coscarelli, who wrote and directed 4 episodes so farthe fifth being in production. The first one is a semi-cult classic, the second is a horror-feast of gore and violence and the rest can easily be skipped. A.

{"value":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Acting was terrible, both for the kids and the adults. Most to all characters showed no, little or not enough emotion. The lighting was terrible, and there were too many mess ups about the time of the day the film was shot (In the river scene where they just get their boat destroyed, there's 4 shots; The sheriff and Dad in the evening on their boat, Jillian and Molly in the evening swimming, the rest of the kids in the daytime *when it's supposed to in the evening* at the river bank, and the doctor, Beatrice, and Simonton at night but not in the evening getting off their boat.) The best acting in the movie was probably from the sheriff, Cappy (Although, there's a slip of character when the pulse detector *Whatever that thing is when people die, it beeps* shows Cappy has died, he still moves while it can still be heard beeping, and while the nurse extra checks his pulse manually, then it shows the pulse again, and THEN he finally dies.) I guess it's not going to be perfect, since it's an independent movie, but it still could be better. Not worth watching, honestly, even for kids. Might as well watch something good, like The Lion King or Toy Story if you're going to see anything you'll remember.","finished_norm":["on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","act","be","terribl","both","for","the","kid","and","the","adult","much","to","all","charact","show","no","littl","or","not","enough","emot","the","light","be","terribl","and","there","be","too","mani","mess","up","about","the","time","of","the","dai","the","film","be","shoot","in","the","river","scene","where","thei","just","get","their","boat","destroi","there","shot","the","sheriff","and","dad","in","the","even","on","their","boat","jillian","and","molli","in","the","even","swim","the","rest","of","the","kid","in","the","daytim","when","it","suppos","to","in","the","even","at","the","river","bank","and","the","doctor","beatric","and","simonton","at","night","but","not","in","the","even","get","off","their","boat","the","well","act","in","the","movi","be","probabl","from","the","sheriff","cappi","although","there","a","slip","of","charact","when","the","puls","detector","whatev","that","thing","be","when","peopl","die","it","beep","show","cappi","have","die","he","still","move","while","it","can","still","be","hear","beep","and","while","the","nurs","extra","check","hi","puls","manual","then","it","show","the","puls","again","and","then","he","final","die","i","guess","it","not","go","to","be","perfect","sinc","it","a","independ","movi","but","it","still","can","be","well","not","worth","watch","honestli","even","for","kid","mai","a","good","watch","someth","good","like","the","lion","king","or","toi","stori","if","you","re","go","to","see","anyth","you","will","rememb"],"filtered":["wrong","movi","ever","see","act","terribl","kid","adult","much","charact","show","littl","enough","emot","light","terribl","mani","mess","time","dai","film","shoot","river","scene","thei","get","boat","destroi","shot","sheriff","dad","even","boat","jillian","molli","even","swim","rest","kid","daytim","suppos","even","river","bank","doctor","beatric","simonton","night","even","get","boat","well","act","movi","probabl","sheriff","cappi","although","slip","charact","puls","detector","whatev","thing","peopl","die","beep","show","cappi","die","still","move","still","hear","beep","nurs","extra","check","hi","puls","manual","show","puls","final","die","guess","go","perfect","sinc","independ","movi","still","well","worth","watch","honestli","even","kid","mai","good","watch","someth","good","like","lion","king","toi","stori","re","go","see","anyth","rememb"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","see","act","terribl","kid","adult","charact","show","littl","enough","emot","light","terribl","mani","mess","time","dai","shoot","river","scene","get","boat","destroi","shot","sheriff","dad","even","boat","jillian","molli","even","swim","rest","kid","daytim","suppos","even","river","bank","doctor","beatric","simonton","night","even","get","boat","well","act","probabl","sheriff","cappi","although","slip","charact","puls","detector","whatev","thing","peopl","die","beep","show","cappi","die","still","move","still","hear","beep","nurs","extra","check","puls","manual","show","puls","final","die","guess","go","perfect","sinc","independ","still","well","worth","watch","honestli","even","kid","mai","good","watch","someth","good","like","lion","king","toi","stori","re","go","see","anyth","rememb"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,14,17,19,20,21,23,25,28,29,44,46,50,53,64,68,93,104,114,117,132,148,149,156,162,166,210,216,219,226,237,243,275,290,293,353,407,441,505,506,541,557,677,692,734,738,757,1001,1016,1211,1265,1412,1449,1644,1665,2234,2547,2746,2867,3093,5676,6612,8224],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,14,17,19,20,21,23,25,28,29,44,46,50,53,64,68,93,104,114,117,132,148,149,156,162,166,210,216,219,226,237,243,275,290,293,353,407,441,505,506,541,557,677,692,734,738,757,1001,1016,1211,1265,1412,1449,1644,1665,2234,2547,2746,2867,3093,5676,6612,8224],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,4.630085528630655,1.9416538289407692,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,2.330690080046114,2.324031090670098,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,4.635688258055728,1.3195384777338066,1.604729392502474,1.655771293751733,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,5.6502857328064025,2.0064197866819473,2.035389827120098,2.0728240170322856,7.329922258790048,2.2797301185117202,2.253494045787767,2.3018654096236517,2.3253197803590226,2.3451551414151686,2.3586007221245198,4.884774065938707,2.687151791517189,2.6070186965339692,2.5792094178355414,2.5940874818617203,2.640097787510554,2.627841366673578,2.7832848715031413,2.8612813773965557,8.

{"value":"The cover art (which features a man holding a scary pellet gun) would make it seem as if it's a martial arts film. (Hardly.)<br /><br />I find it interesting that the film's real title is Trojan Warrior. (Trojan is a brand of condoms in the US) This movie is loaded with homoeroticism. If you like that stuff, then this film isn't that bad really. However, consider these points:<br /><br />There are numerous close-ups of actors' groins & butts, (One scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants.) the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime, peach, and red. From a cinematographer's standpoint, this movie's a drag queen! Several scenes feature characters standing EXTREMELY close to one another, occasionally touching as they converse. Also, the cousin of the hero likes women, and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him. Is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey? <br /><br />Shall I go into the fight scenes? (Yes, someone's private parts get grabbed in one fight.) The martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative. No fancy stuff here, just your standard moves you'd see in an old Chuck Norris flick. There's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever LOW-speed chase put on

{"value":"A quite usual trashy Italo-Western, stupid storyline full of clichés and lack of logic, some mediocre actors, dirty settings, lots of punch-fights and people shoot dead on a massive scale.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with Django. - At least not in my German translated version, this German DVD-release is called \"Adios Companeros\" and has Macho Callaghan fighting against Butch Cassidy and Ironhead because their gang killed his one (he's the only survivor). Then you have Butch Cassidy and Ironhead fighting each other because they quarreled and the gang split. And you have Ironhead fighting against everyone because he's just the biggest and most greedy asshole anyway. Yeah, that's it, no more cleverness in the storyline, hehe.<br /><br />A small role by Klaus Kinski as Reverend Cotton is remarkable (that's why I bought this DVD). In one scene he attempts to separate two men fighting by hitting them and screaming \"I said love!\" and in another scene he wins a competition in throwing horseshoes and goes nuts for a second -

{"value":"I had no real expectations going into this movie and I'm glad. Even if I had expected it to be bad I would have been disappointed.<br /><br />Where to start? First, I think 15% of the movie consisted of stock footage of stationary scarecrows in a dark jungle-field. I get it. There's scarecrows. I think the title \"Scarecrows\" was sufficient.<br /><br />Second, not a damn thing is ever explained regarding the scarecrows and paranormal occurrences. There's too many times where I was left going WTF?<br /><br />Third, the movie takes itself seriously. I'm all for a B-movie with buckets of blood, screaming women, and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or ancient curse. But those movies often know they're B-movies and even flaunt it, like Dead Snow (hilarious Scandanavian zombie flick) or Evil Dead 2. But this movie seems oblivious to its crapdom.<br /><br />Finally, there should of been more blood and/or nudity. Yea, I said it. If you're going to have a crap horror movie, make with the killing. And if you're going to have one hot and one semi-hot girl, one of them needs to show some side-boob at a minimum.<br /><br />So, like the summary says, skip \"Scarecrows\" and just poke yourself in the eye.

{"value":"When Carol (Vanessa Hidalgo) starts looking into her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than \"natural causes\". The closer she gets to the truth, the more of a threat she becomes to her sister-in-law, Fiona (Helga Line), and the rest of the local Satanists. They'll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways.<br /><br />If you're into sleazy, Satanic-themed movies, Black Candles has a lot to offer. The movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft-core sex. One scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed. Unfortunately, all the sleaze in the world can't save Black Candles. Most of the movie is a total bore. Other than the one scene I've already mentioned, the numerous sex scenes aren't shocking and certainly aren't sexy. The acting is spotty at best. Even genre favorite Helga Line gives a disappointing performance. The plot really doesn't matter. Its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together. I'm only familiar with one other movie directed by Jose Ramon Larraz. Compared with his Daughters of Darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror, Black Candles comes off as amateurish. 3/10 is about the best I can

{"value":"I'm sure that Operations Dames was a favorite at the drive-ins back in the day. There's absolutely nothing in the way of a plot that you might miss if you were otherwise preoccupied. And if you needed to get in the mood for other activities you did have some curvaceous cuties on screen to get you in the mood.<br /><br />Otherwise there ain't a whole lot that Operations Dames has going for it. It's set in the Korean War where a platoon of GIs together with a British tommy gets a little too far forward and has to get back to the UN lines. Bad enough already, but these guys also come across a stranded bunch of USO girls and their choreographer in the same predicament.<br /><br />You know what's sad about this film is that it took women generations to finally get accepted in the Army and in combat situations. These bimbos from the USO set women's liberation back light years. In fact not even the hard bitten professional soldier who is the sergeant in charge of these men can keep it in his pants.<br /><br />But that was probably the better to remind some what they were at the drive-in for.

{"value":"This movie was okay, but it certainly defeats the claim that homosexuals are \"born that way,\" especially when a woman can exit out of an unhappy marriage and just fall into the arms of another woman. It almost seems as if Kate's gender preferences turned on and off like a switch, making this film seem a little simplistic.<br /><br />Also, as is common with films that are trying to push an agenda, it was unfortunate that those characters in the film who had questions or disapproval over the gay lifestyle were labeled as \"bigots.\" And there was no happy medium. It was either Kate's friends and relatives totally embraced her or they totally shunned her. This is not typical of interactions between gay and non-gay relatives and friends. It is usually a mixture of emotions and values that come into play. It is possible to love people and treat them with respect while not necessarily condoning the choices they make. Sadly, the movie showed none of these types of interactions. For a movie trying to portray tolerance and acceptance, it struck me as very intolerant movie!

{"value":"There is an excellent reason Edison went straight to video: it would have landed in theaters with a crumbling thud. The movie lasted entirely too long and was perilously boring. Just a notch above lowbrow (thanks to Freeman and Spacey, who obviously had a spare two weeks before their next films), the bad guys are as laughable and action as near non-existent as Justin Timberlake's acting. I hate to knock the guy, but the sooner he realizes that pop is his forte, the better.<br /><br />The movie isn't all bad...just mostly. I like the fact that LL Cool J was given what appears to be a shot at being leading man. He deserves it. And, unlike his fellow musician and co-star, he can act. Kevin Spacey is almost always enjoyable as well (you can see him gulp several times as he chews the scenery), and Freeman has the ability to elevate this flick to three stars (out of ten...he's not THAT good).<br /><br />When all is said and done, the ultimate error with this movie is that it is a mundane and tiresome piece of pseudo-action poppycock that fails to keep anyone awake. It also fails to make anyone give a good crap about any of the characters. All in all, t's just plain boring.

{"value":"Wow. Simply awful. I was a fan of the original movie, and begrudgingly sat through part 2, 3 was and improvement. 4,5 and Freddy's Dead were pretty bad. But NOTHING is as bad as Freddy's Nightmares. Freddy acts as a Rod Serlingesq host of this anthology series.<br /><br />I can accept how Freddy became one punchline after another, but at least in the movies the appeal of Freddy carried the movies, but here these were so poorly made, they looked like high school productions of a horror series. The poor actors, if you really want to call yourself that after doing this show were obviously exactly what they paid for. I'm nearly certain this was a stopping point for two types of actors. Ones just starting on the Hollywood ladder, brand new willing to take any part that would put off their having to take that porn job they were offered last week, or seasoned actors on their way down

{"value":"I didn't really know what this movie was about when I went to the theater to see it (hype about the Satanism etc etc etc) as the trailers in the last movie I saw looked pretty interesting.<br /><br />Oh dear, Roman Catholic mythology? Not my idea of a good scare and honestly, I just felt like watching a really good, scary movie, not some loosely plotted religious farce that tries to score cheap thrills by having some chick getting bloody every few minutes!<br /><br />I'll try to keep away from the spoilers (!) but I found it very odd that an Atheist, who gets a string of rosary beads from a deceased priest, could suddenly end up with Christ's wounds (aren't stigmata supposed to be deeply religious??) I mean, she hangs out with losers, does loser stuff, behaves like a typical rebel et al, and here she is displaying the wounds of Jesus Christ?? Come on!<br /><br />Scenes of her crucified, head thrown back, screaming, blood everywhere, became rather tedious after seeing it a dozen times. It was neither frightening or scary, just repulsive. It did, however, become quite painful to watch - those flicking scenes were highly annoying...<br /><br />CONCLUSION: If your a Catholic, defintly don't see this.

{"value":"A Movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers, who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in shark-infested waters. As an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters, I thought this might be my kind of movie... it wasn't!!! This should be more of a guideline of how not to do it! It has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke, in the final scene it goes after the main characters *rolling*, the feet are obviously waving in the air! It looks ridiculous! Good for a laugh though. If it were only for the lack of talent between the actors, the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile, it would be at least worth a laugh, but it gets worse: I'd guess, the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was, so they though up the old idea of \"sex sells\"... Totally, i mean TOTALLY without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast. And somewhere towards the beginning there's some kind of meaningless \"makeout\". This is the last ingredient making the movie absolute trash to me. It's incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish!

{"value":"A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them. That about sums it up.<br /><br />I'll admit that I am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie. But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film, and believe me there is plenty of that to go around, it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />The characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on. Fear, greed, pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. Although it can be argued that that seeming failing, in actuality, serves the telling of the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and quite suitable music. The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother.<br /><br />King manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.","finished_norm":["a","charm","boi","and","hi","mother","move","to","a","middl","of","nowher","town","cat","and","death","soon","follow","them","that","about","sum","it","upbr","br","i","will","admit","that","i","be","a","littl","freak","out","by","cat","after","see","thi","movi","but","in","all","serious","in","spite","of","the","numer","thing","that","be","wrong","with","thi","film","and","believ","me","there","be","plenti","of","that","to","go","around","it","be","overal","a","veri","enjoy","view","experiencebr","br","the","charact","be","much","like","caricatur","here","with","onli","their","basi","instinct","to","reli","on","fear","gre","pride","lust","or","anger","seem","to","be","all","that","motiv","thi","peopl","although","it","can","be","argu","that","that","seem","fail","in","actual","serv","the","tell","of","the","stori","the","supernatur","premis","and","the","fact","that","it","be","a","stephen","king","screenplaynot","that","i","have","anyth","specif","against","mr","king","be","quit","nice","support","by","some","interest","fx","work","makeup","and","quit","suitabl","music","the","absolut","gem","of","thi","film","be","without","a","doubt","alic","krige","who","plai","mari","bradi","the","otherworldli","motherbr","br","king","manag","to","take","a","simpl","stori","of","outsid","or","peopl","who","be","a","littl","differentokai","a","lot","in","thi","case","try","to","fit","in","and","twist","it","into","a","campi","over","the","top","littl","horror","gem","that","have","to","be","in","the","collect","of","ani","horror","fan"],"filtered":["charm","boi","hi","mother","move","middl","nowher","town","cat","death","soon","follow","sum","upbr","br","admit","littl","freak","cat","see","thi","movi","serious","spite","numer","thing","wrong","thi","film","believ","plenti","go","around","overal","veri","enjoy","view","experiencebr","br","charact","much","like","caricatur","onli","basi","instinct","reli","fear","gre","pride","lust","anger","seem","motiv","thi","peopl","although","argu","seem","fail","actual","serv","tell","stori","supernatur","premis","fact","stephen","king","screenplaynot","anyth","specif","mr","king","quit","nice","support","interest","fx","work","makeup","quit","suitabl","music","absolut","gem","thi","film","without","doubt","alic","krige","plai","mari","bradi","otherworldli","motherbr","br","king","manag","take","simpl","stori","outsid","peopl","littl","differentokai","lot","thi","case","try","fit","twist","campi","top","littl","horror","gem","collect","ani","horror","fan"],"filtered2":["charm","boi","mother","move","middl","nowher","town","cat","death","soon","follow","sum","upbr","admit","littl","freak","cat","see","serious","spite","numer","thing","wrong","believ","plenti","go","around","overal","veri","enjoy","view","experiencebr","charact","like","caricatur","onli","basi","instinct","reli","fear","gre","pride","lust","anger","seem","motiv","peopl","although","argu","seem","fail","actual","serv","tell","stori","supernatur","premis","fact","stephen","king","screenplaynot","anyth","specif","mr","king","quit","nice","support","interest","fx","work","makeup","quit","suitabl","music","absolut","gem","without","doubt","alic","krige","plai","mari","bradi","otherworldli","motherbr","king","manag","take","simpl","stori","outsid","peopl","littl","differentokai","lot","case","try","fit","twist","campi","top","littl","horror","gem","collect","ani","horror","fan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,10,11,14,15,17,23,25,27,29,31,35,36,40,48,52,60,72,83,90,91,97,98,104,118,120,125,140,215,222,237,245,260,262,275,282,288,312,345,357,364,371,397,412,435,449,450,459,484,541,554,567,676,691,736,737,791,792,797,799,812,815,888,902,921,960,1026,1148,1313,1347,1426,1593,1662,1734,1811,1915,1965,2015,2032,2104,2137,2148,2453,2767,2795,2831,3005,3092,4036,5063,5223,7994],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,10,11,14,15,17,23,25,27,29,31,35,36,40,48,52,60,72,83,90,91,97,98,104,118,120,125,140,215,222,237,245,260,262,275,282,288,312,345,357,364,371,397,412,435,449,450,459,484,541,554,567,676,691,736,737,791,792,797,799,812,815,888,902,921,960,1026,1148,1313,1347,1426,1593,1662,1734,1811,1915,1965,2015,2032,2104,2137,2148,2453,2767,2795,2831,3005,3092,4036,5063,5223,7994],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,3.3525245991777624,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,2.729695454751562,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,2.926338025798268,1.4680183469605717,1.6284968758320737,1.69551162

{"value":"Although there's Flying Guillotines as part of the title of this movie, it has no connections to the original Flying Guillotines (1975) and its sequel Flying Guillotines II (1978). The two originals are masterpieces of kung-fu movie and still stands out as a classic. This is a much inferior copy of the original, and even as a regular kung-fu movie, it's below average.<br /><br />First of all, this movie doesn't have much acting. It's one senseless fight scene after another, and flying guillotine doesn't even play a major part in them. Story is about some Shaolin monks who are tracking down some villains who've took off with a sacred book, and an evil prince who owns part of this book is part of the plot. The same evil prince has plans to lure the monks in and use the flying guillotines on them.<br /><br />There are four movies with Flying Guillotine as part of its title. This in my opinion is of least quality. The design of the flying guillotine in this movie is different from the other three indicating that this movie was produced by a different entity from the other three.<br /><br />The movie has no chemistry asides from being unintentionally funny due to poor production. <br /><br />Best skip this and watch the two

{"value":"Given the title and outlandish box art, I was ready for just about anything. Perhaps my expectation were forced just a bit to high, because I was left a little dry.<br /><br />A film crew working on a soft-core sex movie end up at a strange house when they get lost in the fog and decide the best way to spend the evening is to have sex. Where hasn't this set up been used before? The difference here is the uber-perverse nature of the sex. Not allowed to show all the goods (groin shots were illegal in Japan for a long time, what is shown is fogged out) the movie tries as hard as it can to show the viewer just how unnatural sex can be.<br /><br />Amidst all the kinky goings on, a mud monster (whose origin I can't fathom) shows up and begins murdering the men and raping the women...then murdering them too. Some of the sights are a bit much, most notably a woman having her intestines pulled out through her vagina or another woman spitting out a mouthful of...stuff, but otherwise the gore is pretty standard fare.<br /><br />Ultimately the film is pulled down by it's own designs; it's too over-sexed to be a strait horror picture and too gruesome to work as a sex flick.

{"value":"I couldn't not recommend a Christmas movie more than this worthless piece of drivel (trust me, double negatives are required here -- it's that bad). This film was in trouble from the opening credits when it was revealed that the screenwriter was the same person as the songwriter. The musical numbers are all far too long and none of them any good (\"Thank You Very Much\" has a decent melody, but the lyrics are stupid beyond words). I would gladly bear the chains worn by Scrooge in the film's bizarre hell sequence than sit through this insult to movie musicals again.<br /><br />The only entertaining part of this movie (completely unintentional by the way) involves Alec Guinness as Jacob Marley. Dressed in a silly powder white costume, Guinness foppishly prances through his scenes in what was either an attempt to make it appear as though he was floating like a ghost, or to show his utter disdain with having to be in this dreadful movie. Albert Finney, meanwhile, blends the best of Alistar Sim and Charles Laughton to create his hopelessly loathsome character of Quasimodo/Scrooge.

{"value":"Is it a remake og the Thing (1982/1951), i think it is, there are so many factors from det previous movies do deny it.<br /><br />So the acting is bad, James Spader does a superlow stargate re-enactment of himself, with his coffy mug and his somwhat strange thinking/movements but that's about it, the other actors i did't even notise. You don't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters. And the plot evolvement is slow, boring and, yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins. Score/music is ultraboring, imean there are alot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit, but this is major crap. Some of the special effects are nice, if it was made in early 90's. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and thrills, don't whatch this movie. its a dull combination of the Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay production gone really really bad. Now this combination would be cool if somone knew what they where doing, and the only ones on this production that knew that was, no one.<br /><br />Though i have seen far worse, i would not recomend this movie to anyone, but if you are up one cold night, and just wanna glanse at something, it will pass the time, slowly.","finished_norm":["be","it","a","remak","og","the","thing","i","think","it","be","there","be","so","mani","factor","from","det","previou","movi","do","deni","itbr","br","so","the","act","be","bad","jame","spader","doe","a","superlow","stargat","reenact","of","himself","with","hi","coffi","mug","and","hi","somwhat","strang","thinkingmov","but","that","about","it","the","other","actor","i","do","t","even","notis","you","do","not","get","the","feel","of","get","to","know","anyon","of","the","main","charact","and","the","plot","evolv","be","slow","bore","and","yah","i","know","what","be","about","to","happend","in","min","scoremus","be","ultrabor","imean","there","be","alot","of","ubertal","peopl","out","there","that","would","make","score","for","a","coke","and","a","credit","but","thi","be","major","crap","some","of","the","special","effect","be","nice","if","it","be","make","in","earli","if","you","like","slimi","alien","chill","and","thrill","do","not","whatch","thi","movi","it","a","dull","combin","of","the","thing","alien","outbreak","and","some","jerri","bruckheimermichael","bai","product","go","realli","realli","bad","now","thi","combin","would","be","cool","if","somon","know","what","thei","where","do","and","the","onli","on","on","thi","product","that","know","that","be","no","onebr","br","though","i","have","see","far","wrong","i","would","not","recomend","thi","movi","to","anyon","but","if","you","be","up","on","cold","night","and","just","wanna","glans","at","someth","it","will","pass","the","time","slowli"],"filtered":["remak","og","thing","think","mani","factor","det","previou","movi","deni","itbr","br","act","bad","jame","spader","doe","superlow","stargat","reenact","hi","coffi","mug","hi","somwhat","strang","thinkingmov","actor","even","notis","get","feel","get","know","anyon","main","charact","plot","evolv","slow","bore","yah","know","happend","min","scoremus","ultrabor","imean","alot","ubertal","peopl","make","score","coke","credit","thi","major","crap","special","effect","nice","make","earli","like","slimi","alien","chill","thrill","whatch","thi","movi","dull","combin","thing","alien","outbreak","jerri","bruckheimermichael","bai","product","go","realli","realli","bad","thi","combin","cool","somon","know","thei","onli","thi","product","know","onebr","br","though","see","far","wrong","recomend","thi","movi","anyon","cold","night","wanna","glans","someth","pass","time","slowli"],"filtered2":["remak","og","thing","think","mani","factor","det","previou","deni","itbr","act","bad","jame","spader","doe","superlow","stargat","reenact","coffi","mug","somwhat","strang","thinkingmov","actor","even","notis","get","feel","get","know","anyon","main","charact","plot","evolv","slow","bore","yah","know","happend","min","scoremus","ultrabor","imean","alot","ubertal","peopl","make","score","coke","credit","major","crap","special","effect","nice","make","earli","like","slimi","alien","chill","thrill","whatch","dull","combin","thing","alien","outbreak","jerri","bruckheimermichael","bai","product","go","realli","realli","bad","combin","cool","somon","know","onli","product","know","onebr","though","see","far","wrong","recomend","anyon","cold","night","wanna","glans","someth","pass","time","slowli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,18,21,23,25,26,29,32,41,43,50,53,86,101,106,108,158,179,190,203,210,262,266,313,356,367,390,404,417,430,481,483,487,518,565,620,784,968,1106,1218,1375,1431,1572,1585,1826,2017,2245,2628,3726,3887,4191,4515,4657,4997,5776,7359,7499],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,13,18,21,23,25,26,29,32,41,43,50,53,86,101,106,108,158,179,190,203,210,262,266,313,356,367,390,404,417,430,481,483,487,518,565,620,784,968,1106,1218,1375,1431,1572,1585,1826,2017,2245,2628,3726,3887,4191,4515,4657,4997,5776,7359,7499],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,2.2635883139467947,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,5.329969667884075,2.6390769554676132,1.3711311285073675,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,2.031112399272319,2.098582041218749,2.159084361316692,2.138507503627933,4.621394522982961,2.507968722980095,5.116663665627972,2.569760528637609,2.687151791517189,2.726701583487816,2.747702973022204,2.907069060519773,3.028335462059722,3.0791938792932125,3.132778125427319,3.1419947805322432,3.1932880749197934,3.1419947805322432,3.353630724994973,3.613480989738201,3.3220965805878846,3.4101163271295305,7.81

{"value":"First up this film, according to the slick said it won \"best film\" at \"Worldfest\" Film festival in Houston, Texas. Hmmm must have been a quiet year.<br /><br />Wouldn't call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks, is pretty much just as terrible as other Aussie B grader \"Body Melt\", but at least that film didn't look like it was shot on HI 8 video.<br /><br />My guess is the film makers, watched a lot of Troma films, and really bad B grade gore films, thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I love really low grade films, Just the fact that some of the characters put on fake American accents, almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something. Really disappointing ending as well, the showdown could have been way more exciting, and some good fight scenes. You can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy \"Bad Taste\" with the whole, car explosion, rocket launcher, and endless amount of people being gunned down, yet the finale lacks any

{"value":"There's really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis. I mean it's Shakespeare's Hamlet for goodness sake  probably one of the best known plays ever written. I'm not embarrassed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet the way most people on IMDb have  through Mystery Science Theater 3000. While the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie, in this case I cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips. In a word, this German, made-for-TV version of Hamlet is dreary. 152 minutes? No way! It's too dark and depressing to be anything I want to spend almost three hours on. I've said it any number of times, but entertainment is the thing for me. And this wrist-slitter is far from entertaining. I will, however, give it a couple of points for what I felt was some reasonably good acting. A 3/10 sounds about right to me.<br /><br />As much as I enjoy MST3K, their comments don't help to make Hamlet any more palatable. There are a few good riffs here and there, but overall, Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K. Shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow. As much as it pains me, I've got to give Hamlet a 1/5 on my MST3K rating scale.","finished_norm":["there","realli","not","much","ne","to","begin","thi","littl","review","with","a","plot","synopsi","i","mean","it","shakespear","hamlet","for","good","sake","probabl","on","of","the","well","know","plai","ever","write","i","be","not","embarrass","to","admit","that","i","come","to","thi","version","of","hamlet","the","wai","much","peopl","on","imdb","have","through","mysteri","scienc","theater","while","the","show","mai","not","be","the","well","venu","to","us","to","judg","a","movi","in","thi","case","i","cannot","imagin","attempt","to","watch","it","without","the","comed","quip","in","a","word","thi","german","madefortv","version","of","hamlet","be","dreari","minut","no","wai","it","too","dark","and","depress","to","be","anyth","i","want","to","spend","almost","three","hour","on","i","have","sai","it","ani","numb","of","time","but","entertain","be","the","thing","for","me","and","thi","wristslitt","be","far","from","entertain","i","will","howev","give","it","a","coupl","of","point","for","what","i","feel","be","some","reason","good","act","a","sound","about","right","to","mebr","br","a","much","a","i","enjoi","mstk","their","comment","do","not","help","to","make","hamlet","ani","much","palat","there","be","a","few","good","riff","here","and","there","but","overal","hamlet","be","just","the","wrong","movi","for","mstk","shakespear","be","far","too","talki","to","allow","the","comedi","to","have","ani","sort","of","rhythm","or","flow","a","much","a","it","pain","me","i","have","get","to","give","hamlet","a","on","my","mstk","rate","scale"],"filtered":["realli","much","ne","begin","thi","littl","review","plot","synopsi","mean","shakespear","hamlet","good","sake","probabl","well","know","plai","ever","write","embarrass","admit","come","thi","version","hamlet","wai","much","peopl","imdb","mysteri","scienc","theater","show","mai","well","venu","us","judg","movi","thi","case","imagin","attempt","watch","without","comed","quip","word","thi","german","madefortv","version","hamlet","dreari","minut","wai","dark","depress","anyth","want","spend","almost","three","hour","sai","ani","numb","time","entertain","thing","thi","wristslitt","far","entertain","howev","give","coupl","point","feel","reason","good","act","sound","right","mebr","br","much","enjoi","mstk","comment","help","make","hamlet","ani","much","palat","good","riff","overal","hamlet","wrong","movi","mstk","shakespear","far","talki","allow","comedi","ani","sort","rhythm","flow","much","pain","get","give","hamlet","mstk","rate","scale"],"filtered2":["realli","ne","begin","littl","review","plot","synopsi","mean","shakespear","hamlet","good","sake","probabl","well","know","plai","ever","write","embarrass","admit","come","version","hamlet","wai","peopl","imdb","mysteri","scienc","theater","show","mai","well","venu","us","judg","case","imagin","attempt","watch","without","comed","quip","word","german","madefortv","version","hamlet","dreari","minut","wai","dark","depress","anyth","want","spend","almost","three","hour","ani","numb","time","entertain","thing","wristslitt","far","entertain","howev","give","coupl","point","feel","reason","good","act","sound","right","mebr","enjoi","mstk","comment","help","make","hamlet","ani","palat","good","riff","overal","hamlet","wrong","mstk","shakespear","far","talki","allow","comedi","ani","sort","rhythm","flow","pain","get","give","hamlet","mstk","rate","scale"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,7,8,13,14,20,21,23,25,26,27,28,29,30,32,33,34,37,40,43,44,46,56,59,65,66,88,95,101,104,110,113,121,125,127,131,147,148,174,176,177,178,185,195,200,202,220,224,253,258,269,280,283,288,340,368,403,412,424,458,516,521,556,591,691,910,924,1023,1075,1270,1548,1682,1696,1845,1899,1928,2557,2601,2645,3012,3914,5780,5900,6230,6314,7596],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,7,8,13,14,20,21,23,25,26,27,28,29,30,32,33,34,37,40,43,44,46,56,59,65,66,88,95,101,104,110,113,121,125,127,131,147,148,174,176,177,178,185,195,200,202,220,224,253,258,269,280,283,288,340,368,403,412,424,458,516,521,556,591,691,910,924,1023,1075,1270,1548,1682,1696,1845,1899,1928,2557,2601,2645,3012,3914,5780,5900,6230,6314,7596],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,3.9008101766037884,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,2.6728839783437044,1.3711311285073675,2.803707089537043,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.

{"value":"As low budget indies go, you will usually find that you get what you pay for, and let me just say, I didn't pay much for \"Frightworld\"...<br /><br />Writer / Director: David R. Williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park, besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer. Not a bad premise, but executed with a bevy of low budget mistakes. The camera work tries to be too cleaver for it's audience, by constantly using shaky quick-cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us. This becomes evident right off the bat, as we are introduced to the would-be killer, and soon realize that the (acting) is the scariest thing happening... After a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times, yet the acting remains the same. \"Frightworld\" does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the fun-house, but with an extremely long running time, it can't save the film from it's below average indie hell.<br /><br />There is some mediocre nudity, but not much for gore, which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies.<br /><br />Fans of really bad B-Movies might find something of interest here, otherwise, don't spend a lot of cash.","finished_norm":["a","low","budget","indi","go","you","will","usual","find","that","you","get","what","you","pai","for","and","let","me","just","sai","i","do","not","pai","much","for","frightworldbr","br","writer","director","david","r","william","bring","u","the","stori","of","a","abandon","amus","park","besieg","by","the","veng","spirit","of","a","slai","serial","killer","not","a","bad","premis","but","execut","with","a","bevi","of","low","budget","mistak","the","camera","work","try","to","be","too","cleaver","for","it","audienc","by","constantli","us","shaki","quickcut","to","cover","the","fact","that","thei","realli","have","noth","gori","or","scari","to","show","u","thi","becom","evid","right","off","the","bat","a","we","be","introduc","to","the","wouldb","killer","and","soon","realiz","that","the","act","be","the","scari","thing","happen","after","a","painfulli","long","titl","sequenc","we","be","bring","back","to","modern","time","yet","the","act","remain","the","same","frightworld","doe","gener","some","rather","uniqu","cinematographi","when","show","sceneri","from","insid","the","funhous","but","with","a","extrem","long","run","time","it","ca","not","save","the","film","from","it","below","averag","indi","hellbr","br","there","be","some","mediocr","nuditi","but","not","much","for","gore","which","be","usual","the","save","grace","for","thi","typ","of","moviesbr","br","fan","of","realli","bad","bmovi","mai","find","someth","of","interest","here","otherwis","do","not","spend","a","lot","of","cash"],"filtered":["low","budget","indi","go","usual","find","get","pai","let","sai","pai","much","frightworldbr","br","writer","director","david","r","william","bring","u","stori","abandon","amus","park","besieg","veng","spirit","slai","serial","killer","bad","premis","execut","bevi","low","budget","mistak","camera","work","try","cleaver","audienc","constantli","us","shaki","quickcut","cover","fact","thei","realli","noth","gori","scari","show","u","thi","becom","evid","right","bat","introduc","wouldb","killer","soon","realiz","act","scari","thing","happen","painfulli","long","titl","sequenc","bring","back","modern","time","yet","act","remain","frightworld","doe","gener","rather","uniqu","cinematographi","show","sceneri","insid","funhous","extrem","long","run","time","ca","save","film","averag","indi","hellbr","br","mediocr","nuditi","much","gore","usual","save","grace","thi","typ","moviesbr","br","fan","realli","bad","bmovi","mai","find","someth","interest","otherwis","spend","lot","cash"],"filtered2":["low","budget","indi","go","usual","find","get","pai","let","pai","frightworldbr","writer","director","david","r","william","bring","u","stori","abandon","amus","park","besieg","veng","spirit","slai","serial","killer","bad","premis","execut","bevi","low","budget","mistak","camera","work","try","cleaver","audienc","constantli","us","shaki","quickcut","cover","fact","realli","noth","gori","scari","show","u","becom","evid","right","bat","introduc","wouldb","killer","soon","realiz","act","scari","thing","happen","painfulli","long","titl","sequenc","bring","back","modern","time","yet","act","remain","frightworld","doe","gener","rather","uniqu","cinematographi","show","sceneri","insid","funhous","extrem","long","run","time","ca","save","averag","indi","hellbr","mediocr","nuditi","gore","usual","save","grace","typ","moviesbr","fan","realli","bad","bmovi","mai","find","someth","interest","otherwis","spend","lot","cash"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,8,9,13,17,18,21,28,29,36,38,46,48,49,53,56,58,60,63,72,81,94,97,99,112,115,121,124,137,140,160,168,189,194,217,225,231,250,252,256,264,265,283,287,322,329,349,358,384,396,405,449,484,491,592,612,627,629,643,662,675,682,708,720,729,787,890,894,929,935,1015,1134,1138,1149,1156,1241,1286,1300,1454,1474,1486,1487,1602,2074,2543,3265,3667,4559,6630,6683],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,8,9,13,17,18,21,28,29,36,38,46,48,49,53,56,58,60,63,72,81,94,97,99,112,115,121,124,137,140,160,168,189,194,217,225,231,250,252,256,264,265,283,287,322,329,349,358,384,396,405,449,484,491,592,612,627,629,643,662,675,682,708,720,729,787,890,894,929,935,1015,1134,1138,1149,1156,1241,1286,1300,1454,1474,1486,1487,1602,2074,2543,3265,3667,4559,6630,6683],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.8837873718108231,2.1367141713444147,2.2635883139467947,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,2.324031090670098,3.0904588387038183,1.3195384777338066,1.4680183469605717,3.038623282696244,1.655771293751733,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,1.8610609350701788,1.8657013146266

{"value":"At least I was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since I was barely able to sit through it. In all honesty, my guess is the cover to the DVD case cost more than the entire movie. And saying that it is the same director as The Boogeyman, when a new version of that just came out...nice touch guys, it was misleading enough to rope me in. The only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut. Usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it. The film looks like it was shot by a D+ grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes....sometimes, less is more buddy. Through out I would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained. All this makes a bad movie but when the ending doesn't even come close to pulling it together, well, that makes it an exceptionally bad movie. Without a doubt this is the worst movie I have ever seen, and that includes my friends' french final video for senior year of high school, but hey maybe i'm a bit biased, I mean I did get to play an extra.

{"value":"Sundown - featuring the weakest, dorkiest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most unfitting, pretentious scores ever written - and with Shane the vampire, who's every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that I burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the rest.<br /><br />The vampires don't seem to have any special powers at all - except for strength (sometimes), being able to switch off a lamp with their mind (one time) and... that's it, really. Ever imagine count Dracula worriedly recoiling from a fight 'cause he ran out of bullets? Neither did I. Practically any other movie-Dracula would eat this one for breakfast, skin his followers and use their bones as toothpicks.<br /><br />The main plot of the movie is that a human family of four gets caught up in a vampire gang fight - Dracula's vs. some old geezer's. It could have been some good old B-flick fun, but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a bit too seriously, and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie not already ruined by clay bats, mediocre acting and the laughable screenplay.<br /><br />In the end it's just too silly to be funny. Sure, it has some amusing moments, but they're few, and far apart.","finished_norm":["sundown","featur","the","weak","dorkiest","vampir","ever","see","accompani","by","on","of","the","much","unfit","pretenti","score","ever","write","and","with","shane","the","vampir","who","everi","move","and","speak","word","be","so","ridicul","that","i","burst","out","laugh","half","the","time","and","roll","my","ey","the","restbr","br","the","vampir","do","not","seem","to","have","ani","special","power","at","all","except","for","strength","sometim","be","abl","to","switch","off","a","lamp","with","their","mind","on","time","and","that","it","realli","ever","imagin","count","dracula","worriedli","recoil","from","a","fight","caus","he","run","out","of","bullet","neither","do","i","practic","ani","other","moviedracula","would","eat","thi","on","for","breakfast","skin","hi","follow","and","us","their","bone","a","toothpicksbr","br","the","main","plot","of","the","movi","be","that","a","human","famili","of","four","get","catch","up","in","a","vampir","gang","fight","dracula","v","some","old","geezer","it","can","have","be","some","good","old","bflick","fun","but","the","overli","dramat","music","be","clearli","write","by","someon","who","take","thi","movi","a","bite","too","serious","and","end","up","ruin","the","remain","part","of","the","movi","not","alreadi","ruin","by","clai","bat","mediocr","act","and","the","laughabl","screenplaybr","br","in","the","end","it","just","too","silli","to","be","funni","sure","it","have","some","amus","moment","but","thei","re","few","and","far","apart"],"filtered":["sundown","featur","weak","dorkiest","vampir","ever","see","accompani","much","unfit","pretenti","score","ever","write","shane","vampir","everi","move","speak","word","ridicul","burst","laugh","half","time","roll","ey","restbr","br","vampir","seem","ani","special","power","except","strength","sometim","abl","switch","lamp","mind","time","realli","ever","imagin","count","dracula","worriedli","recoil","fight","caus","run","bullet","neither","practic","ani","moviedracula","eat","thi","breakfast","skin","hi","follow","us","bone","toothpicksbr","br","main","plot","movi","human","famili","four","get","catch","vampir","gang","fight","dracula","v","old","geezer","good","old","bflick","fun","overli","dramat","music","clearli","write","someon","take","thi","movi","bite","serious","end","ruin","remain","part","movi","alreadi","ruin","clai","bat","mediocr","act","laughabl","screenplaybr","br","end","silli","funni","sure","amus","moment","thei","re","far","apart"],"filtered2":["sundown","featur","weak","dorkiest","vampir","ever","see","accompani","unfit","pretenti","score","ever","write","shane","vampir","everi","move","speak","word","ridicul","burst","laugh","half","time","roll","ey","restbr","vampir","seem","ani","special","power","except","strength","sometim","abl","switch","lamp","mind","time","realli","ever","imagin","count","dracula","worriedli","recoil","fight","caus","run","bullet","neither","practic","ani","moviedracula","eat","breakfast","skin","follow","us","bone","toothpicksbr","main","plot","human","famili","four","get","catch","vampir","gang","fight","dracula","v","old","geezer","good","old","bflick","fun","overli","dramat","music","clearli","write","someon","take","bite","serious","end","ruin","remain","part","alreadi","ruin","clai","bat","mediocr","act","laughabl","screenplaybr","end","silli","funni","sure","amus","moment","re","far","apart"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,8,13,21,24,27,31,32,35,44,56,61,62,65,67,68,85,101,118,119,133,137,139,154,179,182,188,203,206,232,233,238,258,259,260,274,275,281,292,305,330,340,344,365,371,379,385,452,454,485,494,500,512,518,552,572,599,606,682,708,710,718,756,787,795,885,917,997,1047,1417,1474,1525,1579,1617,1716,2145,2231,2314,2416,2828,3759,4379,6916],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,8,13,21,24,27,31,32,35,44,56,61,62,65,67,68,85,101,118,119,133,137,139,154,179,182,188,203,206,232,233,238,258,259,260,274,275,281,292,305,330,340,344,365,371,379,385,452,454,485,494,500,512,518,552,572,599,606,682,708,710,718,756,787,795,885,917,997,1047,1417,1474,1525,1579,1617,1716,2145,2231,2314,2416,2828,3759,4379,6916],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.8837873718108231,1.1317941569733974,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,2.600540117735859,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,4.814188177507422,1.8610609350701788,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,3.8147700134888347,3.9141830778533158,2.0064197866819473,2.011190219103739,2.098582041218749,2.354379525480895,2.1653408989309972,2.3212364753796515,2.2939035841256437,2.29

{"value":"If you've ever seen an eighties slasher, there isn't much reason to see this one. Originality often isn't one of slasher cinema's strongpoints, and it's something that this film is seriously lacking in. There really isn't much that can said about Pranks, so I'll make this quick. The film was one of the 74 films included on the DPP Video Nasty list, and that was my only reason for seeing it. The plot follows a bunch of kids that stay behind in a dorm at Christmas time. As they're in a slasher, someone decides to start picking them off and this leads to one of the dullest mysteries ever seen in a slasher movie. The fact that this movie was on the Video Nasty list is bizarre because, despite a few gory scenes, this film is hardly going to corrupt or deprave anyone, and gorier slashers than this (Friday the 13th, for example) didn't end up banned. But then again, there's banned films that are much less gory than this one (The Witch Who Came from the Sea, for example). Anyway, the conclusion of the movie is the best thing about it, as although the audience really couldn't care less who the assailant is by this point; it is rather well done. On the whole, this is a dreary and dismal slasher that even slasher fans will do well to miss.","finished_norm":["if","you","have","ever","see","a","eighti","slasher","there","be","not","much","reason","to","see","thi","on","origin","often","be","not","on","of","slasher","cinema","strongpoint","and","it","someth","that","thi","film","be","serious","lack","in","there","realli","be","not","much","that","can","sai","about","prank","so","i","will","make","thi","quick","the","film","be","on","of","the","film","includ","on","the","dpp","video","nasti","list","and","that","be","my","onli","reason","for","see","it","the","plot","follow","a","bunch","of","kid","that","stai","behind","in","a","dorm","at","christma","time","a","thei","re","in","a","slasher","someon","decid","to","start","pick","them","off","and","thi","lead","to","on","of","the","dull","mysteri","ever","see","in","a","slasher","movi","the","fact","that","thi","movi","be","on","the","video","nasti","list","be","bizarr","becaus","despit","a","few","gori","scene","thi","film","be","hardli","go","to","corrupt","or","deprav","anyon","and","gori","slasher","than","thi","fridai","the","th","for","exampl","do","not","end","up","ban","but","then","again","there","ban","film","that","be","much","littl","gori","than","thi","on","the","witch","who","come","from","the","sea","for","exampl","anywai","the","conclus","of","the","movi","be","the","well","thing","about","it","a","although","the","audienc","realli","can","not","care","littl","who","the","assail","be","by","thi","point","it","be","rather","good","do","on","the","whole","thi","be","a","dreari","and","dismal","slasher","that","even","slasher","fan","will","do","good","to","miss"],"filtered":["ever","see","eighti","slasher","much","reason","see","thi","origin","often","slasher","cinema","strongpoint","someth","thi","film","serious","lack","realli","much","sai","prank","make","thi","quick","film","film","includ","dpp","video","nasti","list","onli","reason","see","plot","follow","bunch","kid","stai","behind","dorm","christma","time","thei","re","slasher","someon","decid","start","pick","thi","lead","dull","mysteri","ever","see","slasher","movi","fact","thi","movi","video","nasti","list","bizarr","becaus","despit","gori","scene","thi","film","hardli","go","corrupt","deprav","anyon","gori","slasher","thi","fridai","th","exampl","end","ban","ban","film","much","littl","gori","thi","witch","come","sea","exampl","anywai","conclus","movi","well","thing","although","audienc","realli","care","littl","assail","thi","point","rather","good","whole","thi","dreari","dismal","slasher","even","slasher","fan","good","miss"],"filtered2":["ever","see","eighti","slasher","reason","see","origin","often","slasher","cinema","strongpoint","someth","serious","lack","realli","prank","make","quick","includ","dpp","video","nasti","list","onli","reason","see","plot","follow","bunch","kid","stai","behind","dorm","christma","time","re","slasher","someon","decid","start","pick","lead","dull","mysteri","ever","see","slasher","fact","video","nasti","list","bizarr","becaus","despit","gori","scene","hardli","go","corrupt","deprav","anyon","gori","slasher","fridai","th","exampl","end","ban","ban","littl","gori","witch","come","sea","exampl","anywai","conclus","well","thing","although","audienc","realli","care","littl","assail","point","rather","good","whole","dreari","dismal","slasher","even","slasher","fan","good","miss"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,8,11,13,14,19,20,22,24,29,32,34,44,53,66,68,69,71,95,97,111,114,139,140,157,158,160,168,183,205,237,240,249,255,260,301,307,366,367,371,386,391,393,400,403,409,419,446,601,665,731,748,823,853,956,1052,1135,1173,1487,1598,1676,1783,2332,2601,3158,3326,3413,4694,6107],"values":[1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,6,8,11,13,14,19,20,22,24,29,32,34,44,53,66,68,69,71,95,97,111,114,139,140,157,158,160,168,183,205,237,240,249,255,260,301,307,366,367,371,386,391,393,400,403,409,419,446,601,665,731,748,823,853,956,1052,1135,1173,1487,1598,1676,1783,2332,2601,3158,3326,3413,4694,6107],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.6228008218775787,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,2.2635883139467947,2.2350163994518417,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,3.209458785004948,1.7003182735607676,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,2.127032521151058,1.9214926742550966,4.064665311355097,2.0545557924622586,2.1183455303375887,2.4433074195966826,2.2939035841256437,2.317169775997098,2.3360150694757706,2.3106972614914807,2.3722295531801256,2.4894767118610357,2.4885128563647294,2.571852579609833,2.640097787510554,5.533214255322713,2.6754694

{"value":"Yeah, stupidity! I just finish watching and I still have bad taste in my mouth. Too much colors, too much unnecessary \"addons\" to a story, too much stupid characters (I presume they wanted to achieve comic relief, but I only wanted to cry)... too much of everything. Shame to spoil one of divine stories from \"Arabian Nights\" like this. Childish, naive (both on a bad way) and with lot of magic-breaking mistakes, I don't think this could keep a child of five for more then ten minutes. Princess is lovely, but should be tongueless, cause actress don't know how to carry a role. Rest of the cast is even worse...our \"bad guy\" is REALLY bad. Shame that the \"good guy\" is not better. Only light in this dark is, of course, David Carradine, who goes unfortunately deeply down under his level with this, but at least keep his actor/\"fighter\" skills at top. I'm still sorry to see him in a thing like this, but glad that I had something to watch in whole charade, so thank you David. Only, ONLY, for him, I give this 2 stars to this fiasco...I would give more for him, but that would rise final score to entire movie.

{"value":"After stopping by the movie store to find something to watch, we stumbled on this. It looked appealing from the summary, at least, so we gave it a try. And here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! It's actually enjoyable! Oh, wait, spoke too soon.<br /><br />Somewhere in there, the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental, right-wing Christian brain-washing. Not entirely sure what happens, but I think the screenplay writer found God somewhere in there, finished writing this script, and had no time to edit it because he had a KKK meeting to get to with his friends from the Westboro Church and his hood wasn't clean.<br /><br />Can they put warnings on this? I refuse to support this religious idiocy. Much like video games have rating systems, movies need some sort of symbol: maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worse.<br /><br />Unless you share sentiments with whatever moron came up with this story, and will have your Bible open in your lap while you watch this and plan on how you'll convert your neighbors, don't waste your time.

{"value":"I love killer Insects movies they are great fun to watch, I had to watch this movie as it was one of my Favourite horror books by Shaun Hutson.<br /><br />I have met him and I wish I did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he Said it was,after he said that I was still dying to see how bad it was.<br /><br />The plot: People are dying mysteriously and gruesomely, and nobody has a clue what the cause is.<br /><br />Only health worker Mike Brady has a possible solution, but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities.<br /><br />Only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from England begins snooping around does it begin to look like Mike had the right idea after all.<br /><br />This movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie! Slugs in this movie are fast (Then normal) and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes! <br /><br />This movie is nothing like the book at all, the book was ten times scarier, ten times gory and had a lot more story to it!<br /><br />I didn't like this movie at all!

{"value":"Disappointing and undeniably dull true-crime movie that has poorly cast character actor Jeremy Renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer, who was easily one of the last century's most recognizable degenerates/serial killers. Released straight-to-video back in early 2003, \"Dahmer\" is an overtly talky, boring, badly acted and virtually bloodless snore-fest of a true-crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do! What it does, however, attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely, nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin' for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold, calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was! Overall, 2003's \"Dahmer\" is one that true-crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because I'm not kidding when I say that it's one of the worst serial-killer biopics ever done! It's even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight-to-video trash like \"Gacy\", \"Bundy\", \"Ed Gein\" and \"The Night Stalker\"!

{"value":"Never saw the original movie in the series...I only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980's as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified. This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. It was, however, a movie that would make some Walt Disney movies look dark. Really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. The only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid. The story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water. Not really worth watching I would however like to see the original, granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80's, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70's
