{"value":"Vipul Shah has done some really impressive work as a filmmaker in the past. 'Waqt - The Race Against Time' and 'Namaste London' were entertaining and interesting to watch. 'Singh Is Kinng' was fun, which he produced. His latest outing as a filmmaker 'London Dreams' comes up as his careers weakest fare.<br /><br />'London Dreams' has a mediocre storyline, it's about how success turns friendship into hatred. Agreed, it has the potential but when you watch 'London Dreams' you wonder what's happening? This film has maybe the worst climax in recent times. Vipul Shah the writer puts Vipul Shah the director down. <br /><br />The first hour is boring, The second hour is better; but again the climax is horrendous. How can anyone forgive a person who decided to destroy you? I won't. Ajay Devgn suddenly decides to go to India and ask forgiveness to his diaper buddy, thanks to his uncle Om Puri. When he reaches India, rather than slapping or abusing him Salman welcomes him with band baja and says he was the reason behind the entire fiasco? Was Vipul Shah's intension to show Salman's character as a GOD? If yes, than you've failed completely. The only question I want to ask Vipul Shah is that, would you welcome a person who destroyed you with such a great reception? Write what you feel, don't fool us {the audience}, we are sensible enough to understand what's good or not. <br /><br />This is a musical but the music by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is terrible. Not a single song stays in your mind. <br /><br />Salman is superb though. He carries the film on his shoulders and does really, really well in the emotional scenes. But again his character is shown as a GOD, which makes him look like a retard in the end. Ajay is equally good, but Salman has over-shadowed him completely. Asin is wasted, and what is a great talent like Om Puri doing in this film? Rannvijay hams, though Aditya Roy Kapoor excels. Brinda Parekh is alright as the vamp.<br /><br />On the whole, this dream remains a dream!","finished_norm":["vipul","shah","have","do","some","realli","impress","work","a","a","filmmak","in","the","past","waqt","the","race","against","time","and","namast","london","be","entertain","and","interest","to","watch","singh","be","kinng","be","fun","which","he","produc","hi","late","out","a","a","filmmak","london","dream","come","up","a","hi","career","weak","farebr","br","london","dream","have","a","mediocr","storylin","it","about","how","success","turn","friendship","into","hatr","agre","it","have","the","potenti","but","when","you","watch","london","dream","you","wonder","what","happen","thi","film","have","mayb","the","wrong","climax","in","recent","time","vipul","shah","the","writer","put","vipul","shah","the","director","down","br","br","the","hour","be","bore","the","hour","be","well","but","again","the","climax","be","horrend","how","can","anyon","forgiv","a","person","who","decid","to","destroi","you","i","wo","not","ajai","devgn","suddenli","decid","to","go","to","india","and","ask","forgiv","to","hi","diaper","buddi","thank","to","hi","uncl","om","puri","when","he","reach","india","rather","than","slap","or","abus","him","salman","welcom","him","with","band","baja","and","sai","he","be","the","reason","behind","the","entir","fiasco","be","vipul","shah","intens","to","show","salman","charact","a","a","god","if","ye","than","you","have","fail","complet","the","onli","question","i","want","to","ask","vipul","shah","be","that","would","you","welcom","a","person","who","destroi","you","with","such","a","great","recept","write","what","you","feel","do","not","fool","u","the","audienc","we","be","sensibl","enough","to","understand","what","good","or","not","br","br","thi","be","a","music","but","the","music","by","shankareshaanloi","be","terribl","not","a","singl","song","stai","in","your","mind","br","br","salman","be","superb","though","he","carri","the","film","on","hi","shoulder","and","doe","realli","realli","good","in","the","emot","scene","but","again","hi","charact","be","show","a","a","god","which","make","him","look","like","a","retard","in","the","end","ajai","be","equal","good","but","salman","have","overshadow","him","complet","asin","be","wast","and","what","be","a","great","talent","like","om","puri","do","in","thi","film","rannvijai","ham","though","aditya","roi","kapoor","excel","brinda","parekh","be","alright","a","the","vampbr","br","on","the","whole","thi","dream","remain","a","dream"],"filtered":["vipul","shah","realli","impress","work","filmmak","past","waqt","race","time","namast","london","entertain","interest","watch","singh","kinng","fun","produc","hi","late","filmmak","london","dream","come","hi","career","weak","farebr","br","london","dream","mediocr","storylin","success","turn","friendship","hatr","agre","potenti","watch","london","dream","wonder","happen","thi","film","mayb","wrong","climax","recent","time","vipul","shah","writer","put","vipul","shah","director","br","br","hour","bore","hour","well","climax","horrend","anyon","forgiv","person","decid","destroi","wo","ajai","devgn","suddenli","decid","go","india","ask","forgiv","hi","diaper","buddi","thank","hi","uncl","om","puri","reach","india","rather","slap","abus","salman","welcom","band","baja","sai","reason","behind","entir","fiasco","vipul","shah","intens","show","salman","charact","god","ye","fail","complet","onli","question","want","ask","vipul","shah","welcom","person","destroi","great","recept","write","feel","fool","u","audienc","sensibl","enough","understand","good","br","br","thi","music","music","shankareshaanloi","terribl","singl","song","stai","mind","br","br","salman","superb","though","carri","film","hi","shoulder","doe","realli","realli","good","emot","scene","hi","charact","show","god","make","look","like","retard","end","ajai","equal","good","salman","overshadow","complet","asin","wast","great","talent","like","om","puri","thi","film","rannvijai","ham","though","aditya","roi","kapoor","excel","brinda","parekh","alright","vampbr","br","whole","thi","dream","remain","dream"],"filtered2":["vipul","shah","realli","impress","work","filmmak","past","waqt","race","time","namast","london","entertain","interest","watch","singh","kinng","fun","produc","late","filmmak","london","dream","come","career","weak","farebr","london","dream","mediocr","storylin","success","turn","friendship","hatr","agre","potenti","watch","london","dream","wonder","happen","mayb","wrong","climax","recent","time","vipul","shah","writer","put","vipul","shah","director","hour","bore","hour","well","climax","horrend","anyon","forgiv","person","decid","destroi","wo","ajai","devgn","suddenli","decid","go","india","ask","forgiv","diaper","buddi","thank","uncl","om","puri","reach","india","rather","slap","abus","salman","welcom","band","baja","reason","behind","entir","fiasco","vipul","shah","intens","show","salman","charact","god","ye","fail","complet","onli","question","want","ask","vipul","shah","welcom","person","destroi","great

{"value":"The second half of Steven Soderbergh's revolutionary bio on Che Guevara deals with his last campaign to export revolution to Bolivia. In order to maintain his saintly visage of Che Soderbergh conveniently leap frogs the mass executions he presided over after the revolution in Cuba and the folly of his Congo adventure (\"This is the history of a failure\" he writes in the preface of his Congo Journal) to concentrate fully on Che's attempt to rally support to rise up against the government in Bolivia. It would turn out to be a disaster and Guevara's final act.<br /><br />What plagued the first chapter follows suit here as Soderbergh slows his film to a crawl to study the beatific countenance of the contemplative Guevara once again being played like James Dean in East of Eden by Bernicio Del Toro. The problem is Guevara has little success in gaining converts and he soon finds himself and his starving comrades being swallowed up in the heart of darkness Bolivian Jungle. Unlike Werner Herzog in the magnificent, Aguirre, the Wrath of God Soderbergh fails to utilize the jungle's metaphorical possibilities to heighten the desperation of the guerrillas. He seems more concerned with keeping Che's nimbus above his head than exploring the panic setting in on the dead enders. There is one Herzogian moment where Che sits astride an obstinate horse kicking and screaming to get it moving but overall Soderbergh's mise en scene remains flat, sloppy and uninteresting. <br /><br />In both of his films Soderbergh shows he is clearly a Che groupie and because of it his focus remains myopic and narrow. He spends too much time building his monument to Che and too little in developing his relationships with key players in his saga, especially Fidel Castro. Making matters worse he does it with a slow and dispassionate approach that never catches fire. One would think he was steeped in enough Eisenstein and Vertov to realize that sweeping change is showcased a lot better with sweeping

{"value":"For some reason, in the late 70's and early 80's the local CBS affiliated station in New York kept playing this movie in it's late-night slot on Friday or Saturday nights for several years, usually at 2 a.m. or some such time. It's a fitting movie for that time slot since it's really hard to follow and quite odd (see the other reviews for specific story info). Anyway, after catching it numerous times in those days just before cable TV (And even after it hit but before they offered much all night programming), I kept catching this little oddity. After not seeing it for many years I decided to see if I could find it on DVD. Well, it is only available (from every search i've conducted anyway)in a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label \"Brentwood Video\" as part of a 4-pack of movies (4 movies on 2 double sided discs)called \"Alien Worlds\" if anyone is interested. It's usually available for around $10-but even much less if you shop around. The other 3 movies on this set are readily available in numerous other collections of public domain movies, so no need to comment on them here. But I haven't seen \"Eyes\" available anywhere else. Though hardly a \"restored\" version in any way, this print runs exactly 92 minutes, so for once IMDb's stated running time of 90 minutes is not correct. Even with the 92 minute running time it's not unusual for a movie dubbed into English from another language to also have some of the running time trimmed. It seems to be a common budget-conscience practice to sometimes save money by not bothering to dub some scenes at all if they are not considered to be important to the story. Would a longer version make in any less confusing? Who really knows-unless you've seen it in it's native language... By the way, my attempts to watch this during the day don't work and I end up just turning it off. There's something about watching this in the middle of the night that just fits this movie..or maybe it's just from my earlier experiences, who

{"value":"In the recent movement to bring Asian films over to America, this is THE LAST movie that should be released here. Being a big fan of asian movies from all genres, I was browsing the net and came across this soong to be re-released into the US market so I decided to check it out ahead of time and rent this at a local video store.<br /><br />Trust me...the action scenes are incredibly disappointing, Crouching Tiger and Iron Monkey completely blew this movie out of the water. Jet Li would fall asleep watching the fighting sequences. If you're looking for martial arts entertainment, your time would be better off with a Jackie Chan flick!!!<br /><br />Moreover...you think you're going to watch a martial arts with about a girl engulfed in vengence for her parents death BUT SURPRISE!!! A good hour of this movie in the middle has is filled with dialogue, an absense of action, the lack of devloping a tangent plot, pretty much NOTHING to do with the premise we are exposed to. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, and the boy with his conspiracy group in which the producer/director dedicated no time in elbaorating, and yet dedicated a portion of the film dragging the issue. Would of been much better off if they had just cut that whole hour and developed the story in itself through another film and focus on the martial arts aspect.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I really don't believe the choreographer of Iron Monkey, did the action sequence in Princess Blade. I was completely insulted in the frequent usage of slow motion and quick camera changes to portray the assassins physical swiftness. I just didn't buy it.<br /><br />Please...I'm warning you to PLEASE do not waste your time/money with this movie. The premise is intrigueing, and the trailer might even tempt you but I am positive that this movie is NOT suited for the public (maybe in Japan but not in the states) and will be the worst film brought over to the states from the Asian film

{"value":"So I finally saw the film \"My Left Foot\" last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is... The central performance of Day-Lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing, but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less.<br /><br />The fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man; the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk. On the one hand I can see that this is a logical correlation; mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable, and disability shouldn't obscure that. I just wish that impartial onlookers wouldn't be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable. They don't. Acting out is normal, and so yes, disabled people act out - but they don't do it because they're disabled; they do it because they're being unreasonable. A physical impairment doesn't afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public, just because someone you love turns you down.<br /><br />There are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or able-bodied. Giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them. (Admittedly, I did once save a penalty from the school's star striker with my face, but I already belonged by then. It wasn't for acceptance.) Engaging in a bar brawl is another. Revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after you've proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far. All of these things are stupid, and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery doesn't make them any less foolhardy.<br /><br />So yes; just because you've overcome obstacles to achieve great things doesn't make you any less of a jerk... Being a good person takes priority; setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the

{"value":"Forgive me for stating the obvious, but some films are good and some films are bad. Of course, there are extremes within those two broad categories. Films such as The Godfather, Saving Private Ryan, and Star Wars slot comfortably into the good category. At the other end of the spectrum there are those films that simply don't deserve to be mentioned by name. Occasionally however, someone produces a truly woeful film. A film that should be singled out as a demonstration of how awful a film can be. A film that is more than bad. Such a film is Maiden Voyage.<br /><br />Briefly, Maiden Voyage is a story about a luxury cruise ship that is hijacked by a gang of evil criminals who demand a ransom from an equally evil, scheming ship's owner. Of course, there is an all American hero on board, complete with chiselled jaw and sculptured chest, who saves the day.<br /><br />This is a production that plumbs new depths. Everything about it is bad. The acting, the direction and the so-called plot are breath-takingly poor. In short, it is an insult to the intelligence of any unfortunate viewer. Even an American viewer would be annoyed by its shortcomings.<br /><br />Yes, it's that bad.<br /><br />I will resist the temptation to compose a list of things that angered me about this film. However, its dumber-than-dumb conclusion should serve as an adequate example of what I mean.<br /><br />Imagine in your mind that you are an evil hijacker and you are stood in an open lifeboat on a calm sea. You are in company with the hero who holds a ticking bomb. Said hero throws the bomb to you and dives overboard. What would you do? I don't know about you, but I would throw the bomb as far as I possibly could into the sea. Not this guy. He watches as our hero swims away and then he tries to disarm the bomb with unfortunate (for him) results. Enough said. Such a demise would merit a mention in the Darwin Awards website and might also be a suitably apt conclusion to the production team's

{"value":"Left Behind is the kind of \"we know what we know cause we know it\" movie that Christians (and most any other naive person) needs to help them feel like what they \"THINK\" and \"BELIEVE\" (not \"KNOW\") is right. But, at the same time I feel bad for the little guys, because this is not a well made film. It does not help ANY message. I work at a video store, and I KNOW the ONLY reason people went to see this movie was because they were religious and they thought it was. ANYBODY on this earth who THINKS they know what will happen in the future is wrong, unless they think they know that they don't know. I've had about enough (but only after I've had too much) of these people walking around with their noses in the air thinking that a movies starring a semi-talented TV actor means something above me.<br /><br />Please, if you love yourself you'll stay away. I refuse to go into any detail about this movie (not because A-I didn't see it (because I did), B-it was too shocking for my atheist-self to handle (because it wasn't), or C-I really don't have anything to say bad about it (because I do). The Reason, (which is a word nobody who helped make this movie understands) is that I want this movie out of my head, I want that it was made out of my head, I want that I watched ALL OF IT WITH AN OPEN MIND out of my head, I want the message that Kirk so proudly and coachly gives at the end of the movie out of my head. I only want all the things that were in my head BEFORE viewing this movies there, anything directly connected with this movie that's floating in my head GET OUT! My peaceful rage is ending. I'm sorry that somebody in this world went to the theater to see this movie about what could happen in the future (but won't) when they could have given that Seven Dollars Plus to any number of Human, Animal, or Rain Forest charity.

{"value":"I dont know about you, but I've always felt drawn to 'ART' cinema. The first 'art' film I managed to get a hold of was Peter Greenaway's \"The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover\", which blew my mind and creative spiret into overdrive. The film was the ultimate paradox, both beautiful and grotesque...this is what 'art cinema' was about, exploring intellectual ideas and bringing the visceral to the screen with purpose. Life, real life, can be like living in a madhouse, and art expressed shows it for what it is. I love movies of all types, but especially those that both entertain and have something to say, whether I agree with it's stance or no...<br /><br />\"8 1/2 WOMEN\", is a dry, clinical 'comedy' where a father and son gather a harem to fufill their many sexual fantasies. There is only a very brief allusion to Fellini in the film, unlike what the previews have suggested. The main focus of the film falls on the 'close' relationship between father and son, brought together after the mothers' death. In the early scenes of the film the fathers' sadness is believable, you can feel his pain. What happens afterwards is plain by Greenaway standards, the gathering of the harem, observations on love and death, and flesh displayed for the sake of flesh...One could argue this, but I feel the movie to be shallow and pointless. And the idea that this could be a comedy is perplexing to me. The acting for the most part if fine,...especially good are Polly Walker and Amanda Plummer(though poor Mandy should put her clothes back on) What the film lacks is a compelling story, and the usual Greenaway touches of excess that made his other films so wonderful to watch. <br /><br />While filled with moments of insight, and the occasional taboo, \"8 1/2 Women\" is too cut and paste to be considered art, too bland to considered 'funny', and simply too dull to be considered worthwhile.<br /><br />Save your money...I can only recommend this film as a sleeping aid.<br /><br />4 out of

{"value":"I'd have to admit that the draw of this movie is director Eduardo Sanchez, who helmed the wildly popular and successful Blair Witch Project. Besides, this is an alien movie of sorts, and sounded something like Stephen King's Dreamcatchers, one of those movies that the critics hated, but I enjoyed.<br /><br />But nope, unfortunately I felt that for the most parts, Altered is a waste of time, so I shall keep this review short. Premises are always promising, and Altered's no different. It tells the story of a group of men who experienced strange encounters when they were younger, and as usual, others will take you as a nutcase imagining stuff. Stories about alien abduction always have to deal with probes into the orifices, so I shall not go into details, but you get the drift it's damn uncomfortable, and something you'd like to forget.<br /><br />What if you're given a chance for revenge? That is, you manage to successfully hunt down, and capture one alive. What will you do? For this group, it's a gleeful payback time, or so they thought. And this is where the movie begins to develop into a snoozefest, with bad, uninspiring dialogue, and even worse acting. Even if it's low budgeted, there aren't many redeeming factors, be it strength of storyline, or any help from the cast in making their characters just a tad interesting. It's the standard cardboard fare from a vanilla plain script, coupled with some cheap scare tactics employed.<br /><br />What's good though is the makeup. Much effort has been put into making some of the stuff which I shan't mention, because that'll spoil just the few elements of what makes this movie tolerable. Other than that, there are the usual cheap special effects, blood and gory moments which is nothing you've never seen before.<br /><br />Watch this only as a last resort. Compared to the other monster movie in town - Feast, this one is less fun, and takes itself too seriously.

{"value":"No? Didn't think so! Well, in that case all you have to do is stay far, far away from \"Do You Wanna Know A Secret\", as it's just the umpteenth pointless post-\"Scream\" slasher with absolutely no redeeming value whatsoever. The plot is extremely ridiculous; the characters are insufferably dumb, the gore-factor is negligible and the whole thing is just plain boring! As you can derive from the title already, this film is mainly inspired by \"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer\", as the events take place in a similar setting and the killer's motivations are equally stupid. Why anyone would want to steal ideas from junk like \"IKWYDLS\" is a complete mystery to me, anyway. At least that film could depend on the precious rack of Jennifer Love Hewitt, whereas the girls in this junk are, apart from brainless, also terribly unattractive. One year after the still unsolved murder of her boyfriend, Beth Morgan, her new adulterous lover and four other simple-minded college students go to Florida to spend their Spring Break holiday in a fancy beach house. The killer hasn't made a move all year, but now he follows the posse to Florida and starts butchering them whilst leaving behind the titular message as some sort of business card. You really don't need to be a horror-expert in order to quickly figure out which face hides behind the unspeakably ridiculous mask and the writers' attempts to put you on the wrong track are downright embarrassing. Since the plot is so thin, most of the film is purely irrelevant padding, including the sub plots regarding the incompetent Floridian police force and the 'mysterious' FBI inspector who seems to have a personal score to settle. The murder inexplicably happen off screen (don't you hate it when that happens?), there isn't even any gratuitous T&A to enjoy and you better don't get me started on the quality of the dialogs. Suffering through crap like this only makes you realize that the delightful spirit of the 80's slashers is gone for

{"value":"When great director/actor combinations are talked about the team of J. Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not usually mentioned. Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre. Unfortunately Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects falls in the latter. <br /><br />That's sad because Kinjite could have been a whole lot better. But for the life of me I don't understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese girl, a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out. That might have been good for another film altogether, but it served no purpose here.<br /><br />A straightforward cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who's seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals. That part could also have used a little explaining as well. But he's going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese school girl.<br /><br />Bronson's time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper. A stylish, murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some history. In fact in the film's best scene, Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire.<br /><br />At one point Fernandez happens to spot Bronson and Lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack, he sprays the place with an Uzi killing everyone, but Bronson and Lopez. I really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the LAPD after Fernandez. But that's another terribly big hole in the plot.<br /><br />Still there is a very rough justice in the end for Fernandez. I wish the whole film had been better though. This was the last film of the Bronson-Thompson team and J. Lee Thompson's last as a director. He should have gone out with something better.","finished_norm":["when","great","directoractor","combin","be","talk","about","the","team","of","j","lee","thompson","and","charl","bronson","be","not","usual","mention","probabl","becaus","the","output","of","nine","joint","ventur","between","the","two","of","them","run","the","gamut","from","the","realli","good","action","entertain","to","the","mediocr","unfortun","kinjit","forbid","subject","fall","in","the","latter","br","br","that","sad","becaus","kinjit","can","have","be","a","whole","lot","well","but","for","the","life","of","me","i","do","not","understand","why","it","be","necessari","to","make","the","father","of","the","miss","japanes","girl","a","gui","us","to","get","some","cheap","jolli","becaus","the","romanc","in","hi","marriag","have","run","out","that","mai","have","be","good","for","anoth","film","altogeth","but","it","serv","no","purpos","herebr","br","a","straightforward","cop","drama","with","charl","bronson","a","a","vice","cop","who","see","a","bite","too","much","in","hi","line","of","work","and","have","a","strong","prejudic","against","orient","that","part","can","conjur","have","us","a","littl","explain","a","good","but","he","go","to","have","to","overcom","it","if","he","and","patient","partner","perri","lopez","be","go","to","locat","a","captur","japanes","school","girlbr","br","bronson","time","in","the","vice","squad","have","tell","him","exactli","where","to","look","for","the","kidnapp","a","stylish","murder","pimp","plai","by","jaim","fernandez","be","the","gui","and","he","and","bronson","have","some","histori","in","fact","in","the","film","well","scene","bronson","make","him","eat","a","expens","rolex","watch","and","set","hi","car","on","firebr","br","at","on","point","fernandez","happen","to","spot","bronson","and","lopez","in","a","all","night","delicatessen","and","thi","be","after","hi","rolex","snack","he","sprai","the","place","with","a","uzi","kill","everyon","but","bronson","and","lopez","i","realli","think","that","littl","incid","would","have","have","much","than","a","coupl","vice","cop","from","the","lapd","after","fernandez","but","that","anoth","terribli","big","hole","in","the","plotbr","br","still","there","be","a","veri","rough","justic","in","the","end","for","fernandez","i","wish","the","whole","film","have","be","well","though","thi","be","the","last","film","of","the","bronsonthompson","team","and","j","lee","thompson","last","a","a","director","he","should","have","go","out","with","someth","well"],"filtered":["great","directoractor","combin","talk","team","j","lee","thompson","charl","bronson","usual","mention","probabl","becaus","output","nine","joint","ventur","two","run","gamut","realli","good","action","entertain","mediocr","unfortun","kinjit","forbid","subject","fall","latter","br","br","sad","becaus","kinjit","whole","lot","well","life","understand","necessari","make","father","miss","japanes","girl","gui","us","get","cheap","jolli","becaus","romanc","hi","marriag","run","mai","good","anoth","film","altogeth","serv","purpos","herebr","br","straightforward","cop","drama","charl","bronson","vice","cop","see","bite","much","hi","line","work","strong","prejudic","orient","part","conjur","us","littl","explain","good","go","overcom","patient","partner","perri","lopez","go","locat","captur","japanes","school","girlbr","br","bronson","time","vice","squad","tell","exactli","look","kidnapp","stylish","murder","pimp","plai","jaim","fernandez","gui","bronson","histori","fact","film","well","scene","bronson","make","eat","expens","rolex","watch","set","hi","car","firebr","br","point","fernandez","happen","spot","bronson","lopez","night","delicatessen","thi","hi","rolex","snack","sprai","place","uzi","kill","everyon","bronson","lopez","realli","think","littl","incid","much","coupl","vice","cop","lapd","fernandez","anoth","terribli","big","hole","plotbr","br","still","veri","rough","justic","end","fernandez","wish","whole","film","well","though","thi","last","film","bronsonthompson","team","j","lee","thompson","last","director","go","someth","well"],"filtered2":["great","directoractor","combin","talk","team","j","lee","thompson","charl","bronson","usual","mention","probabl","becaus","output","nine","joint","ventur","two","run","gamut","realli","good","action","entertain","mediocr","unfortun","kinjit","forbid","subject","fall","latter","sad","becaus","kinjit","whole","lot","well","life","understand","necessari","make","father","miss","japanes","girl","gui","us","get","cheap","jolli","becaus","romanc","marriag","run","mai","good","anoth","altogeth","serv","purpos","herebr","straightforward","cop","drama","charl","bronson","vice","cop","see","bite","line","work","strong","prejudic","orient","part","conjur","us","littl","explain","good","go","overcom","patient","partner","perri","lopez","go","locat","captur","japanes","school","girlbr","bronson","time","vice","squad","tell","exactli","look","kidnapp","stylish","murder","pimp","plai","jaim","fernandez"

{"value":"This film was bad because there was nothing interesting about it. It was sort of a remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? Heck no. So in that regard, the film fails.<br /><br />At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.<br /><br />This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of \"Beneath the Planet of the Apes\". Here's how I would have written it:<br /><br />An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.<br /><br />But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He's a rotten director inspite what of people think. He's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no.

{"value":"Final Score (an average of various classic cinematic qualities- acting, visuals, creativity, payoff, humor, fun, ect):<br /><br />4.3 (out of 10)<br /><br />Had \"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\" come out a few years ago it would have seemed like a bold, serious new direction in Disney animation. However, it comes just a year after the innovative and nearly genius \"The Emperor's New Groove\" and marks a step back in freeing Disney from it's repetative \"Disney Formula\". I'm a big fan of the feature length Disney animated films. Have to see them all love it or hate it. \"Atlantis\" is an animated throwback to \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" and similar live-action sci-fi adventures of the 50s and 60s. Problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea. It feels like a remake of something, even more so than actual Disney remakes(Tarzan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame). The characters are little more than a walking cliches of the usual suspects that typically populate these type of films (the oddball mechanic, the gung ho general, the sassy tough women). Beyond Milo Thatch (Fox) and Rourke (Garner) the supporting cast is flat-out obnoxious. The movie also suffers from it's succinct pace. Instead of fleshing it out into an epic story, Disney jams a lot in the usually brief running time brushing over opportunities to develop...suspence, characters, anything really. They thow us into this new and wonderous world and barely let us get our barings. The awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story. The animation is dark and dreary and cheap. This thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon. Let's hope they haven't forgotten that 2D traditional animation can still be wonderous. \"The Iron Giant\" among others proved that.<br /><br />Negatives: The visuals, pace, and sheer lack of originality.<br /><br />Positives: Quite possibly the coolest death scene for a Disney villain in a long time. It's the creative highlight of the movie.","finished_norm":["final","score","a","averag","of","variou","classic","cinemat","qualiti","act","visual","creativ","payoff","humor","fun","ectbr","br","out","of","br","br","have","atlanti","the","lose","empir","come","out","a","few","year","ago","it","would","have","seem","like","a","bold","seriou","new","direct","in","disnei","anim","howev","it","come","just","a","year","after","the","innov","and","nearli","geniu","the","emperor","new","groov","and","mark","a","step","back","in","free","disnei","from","it","repet","disnei","formula","i","be","a","big","fan","of","the","featur","length","disnei","anim","film","have","to","see","them","all","love","it","or","hate","it","atlanti","be","a","anim","throwback","to","leagu","under","the","sea","and","similar","liveact","scifi","adventur","of","the","and","problem","be","that","thi","version","hardli","contain","on","origin","idea","it","feel","like","a","remak","of","someth","even","much","so","than","actual","disnei","remakestarzan","the","hunchback","of","notr","dame","the","charact","be","littl","much","than","a","walk","clich","of","the","usual","suspect","that","typic","popul","thi","typ","of","film","the","oddbal","mechan","the","gung","ho","gener","the","sassi","tough","woman","beyond","milo","thatch","fox","and","rourk","garner","the","support","cast","be","flatout","obnoxi","the","movi","conjur","suffer","from","it","succinct","pace","instead","of","flesh","it","out","into","a","epic","stori","disnei","jam","a","lot","in","the","usual","brief","run","time","brush","over","opportun","to","developsusp","charact","anyth","realli","thei","thow","u","into","thi","new","and","wonder","world","and","bare","let","u","get","our","bare","the","awkward","pace","sometim","make","confus","what","be","a","rel","simpl","stori","the","anim","be","dark","and","dreari","and","cheap","thi","thing","look","like","a","slap","togeth","saturdai","morn","cartoon","let","hope","thei","have","not","forget","that","have","tradit","anim","can","still","be","wonder","the","iron","giant","among","other","prove","thatbr","br","neg","the","visual","pace","and","sheer","lack","of","originalitybr","br","posit","quit","possibli","the","cool","death","scene","for","a","disnei","villain","in","a","long","time","it","the","creativ","highlight","of","the","movi"],"filtered":["final","score","averag","variou","classic","cinemat","qualiti","act","visual","creativ","payoff","humor","fun","ectbr","br","br","br","atlanti","lose","empir","come","year","ago","seem","like","bold","seriou","new","direct","disnei","anim","howev","come","year","innov","nearli","geniu","emperor","new","groov","mark","step","back","free","disnei","repet","disnei","formula","big","fan","featur","length","disnei","anim","film","see","love","hate","atlanti","anim","throwback","leagu","sea","similar","liveact","scifi","adventur","problem","thi","version","hardli","contain","origin","idea","feel","like","remak","someth","even","much","actual","disnei","remakestarzan","hunchback","notr","dame","charact","littl","much","walk","clich","usual","suspect","typic","popul","thi","typ","film","oddbal","mechan","gung","ho","gener","sassi","tough","woman","beyond","milo","thatch","fox","rourk","garner","support","cast","flatout","obnoxi","movi","conjur","suffer","succinct","pace","instead","flesh","epic","stori","disnei","jam","lot","usual","brief","run","time","brush","opportun","developsusp","charact","anyth","realli","thei","thow","u","thi","new","wonder","world","bare","let","u","get","bare","awkward","pace","sometim","make","confus","rel","simpl","stori","anim","dark","dreari","cheap","thi","thing","look","like","slap","togeth","saturdai","morn","cartoon","let","hope","thei","forget","tradit","anim","still","wonder","iron","giant","among","prove","thatbr","br","neg","visual","pace","sheer","lack","originalitybr","br","posit","quit","possibli","cool","death","scene","disnei","villain","long","time","creativ","highlight","movi"],"filtered2":["final","score","averag","variou","classic","cinemat","qualiti","act","visual","creativ","payoff","humor","fun","ectbr","atlanti","lose","empir","come","year","ago","seem","like","bold","seriou","new","direct","disnei","anim","howev","come","year","innov","nearli","geniu","emperor","new","groov","mark","step","back","free","disnei","repet","disnei","formula","big","fan","featur","length","disnei","anim","see","love","hate","atlanti","anim","throwback","leagu","sea","similar","liveact","scifi","adventur","problem","version","hardli","contain","origin","idea","feel","like","remak","someth","even","actual","disnei","remakestarzan","hunchback","notr","dame","charact","littl","walk","clich","usual","suspect","typic","popul","typ","oddbal","mechan","gung","ho","gener","sassi","tough","woman","beyond","milo","thatch","fox","rourk","garner","support","cast","flatout","obnoxi","conjur","suffer","succinct","pace","instead","flesh","epic","stori","disnei","jam","lot","usual","brief","run","time","bru

{"value":"Yes, people are racist. People are even racist in college. That's a good point, and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films. What sets Higher Learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham-fisted and predictable way possible, oh yeah it's in college too.<br /><br />This film deals with this problem of racism the way Frankenstein deals with most problems, it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner. Most of the characters are cartoonish, one-dimensional, caricatures (lesbian feminist, angry black man), that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. Instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them. The angry black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (one feminist even holds a sign that reads \"Dead Men Don't Rape.\" See what I mean?) I don't want to give anything away, but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist they'll probably behave exactly how you expect them to. The changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie. The big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neo-Nazis will act like violent neo-Nazis. I'll guess you'll just have to watch to find out what happens.<br /><br />Another problem I have with this movie is that it's supposed to be \"gritty\" and \"hard-hitting,\" but they make Nazis the bad guys. I agree Nazis are evil, but that's my point. Everybody thinks Nazis are bad; we're not breaking any new ground here. Nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930's. The film doesn't challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements. It just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy, after-school-special like, manner. Being anti-rape, anti-racist, and anti-Nazi isn't exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue.<br /><br />Higher Learning is predictable, cartoonish, and in a word stupid. Avoid at all costs.","finished_norm":["ye","peopl","be","racist","peopl","be","even","racist","in","colleg","that","a","good","point","and","the","issu","of","racism","have","be","deal","with","mani","time","befor","in","countless","film","what","set","high","learn","apart","from","the","pack","be","that","it","deal","with","the","issu","of","racism","in","the","much","hamfist","and","predict","wai","possibl","oh","ye","it","in","colleg","toobr","br","thi","film","deal","with","thi","problem","of","racism","the","wai","frankenstein","deal","with","much","problem","it","bash","you","over","the","head","repeatedli","in","a","brutal","and","sluggish","manner","much","of","the","charact","be","cartoonish","onedimension","caricatur","lesbian","feminist","angri","black","man","that","react","to","situat","a","dramat","and","predict","a","possibl","instead","of","defi","stereotyp","thi","film","be","overpopul","with","them","the","angri","black","man","feel","cheat","feminist","hate","man","etc","on","feminist","even","hold","a","sign","that","read","dead","man","do","not","rape","see","what","i","mean","i","do","not","want","to","give","anyth","awai","but","in","thi","movi","if","someon","seem","like","a","shifti","lone","or","a","date","rapist","thei","will","probabl","behav","exactli","how","you","expect","them","to","the","chang","the","charact","go","through","seem","obviou","to","everyon","but","the","peopl","in","the","movi","the","big","twist","in","the","plot","hing","on","whether","or","not","the","violent","neonazi","will","act","like","violent","neonazi","i","will","guess","you","will","just","have","to","watch","to","find","out","what","happensbr","br","anoth","problem","i","have","with","thi","movi","be","that","it","suppos","to","be","gritti","and","hardhit","but","thei","make","nazi","the","bad","gui","i","agre","nazi","be","evil","but","that","my","point","everybodi","think","nazi","be","bad","we","re","not","break","ani","new","grind","here","nazi","have","be","portrai","a","villain","sinc","the","the","film","doe","not","challeng","ani","viewpoint","or","make","bold","statem","it","just","deal","with","issu","we","all","know","about","in","a","clumsi","afterschoolspeci","like","manner","be","antirap","antiracist","and","antinazi","be","not","exactli","take","a","hard","stanc","on","a","controversi","issuebr","br","high","learn","be","predict","cartoonish","and","in","a","word","stupid","avoid","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["ye","peopl","racist","peopl","even","racist","colleg","good","point","issu","racism","deal","mani","time","befor","countless","film","set","high","learn","apart","pack","deal","issu","racism","much","hamfist","predict","wai","possibl","oh","ye","colleg","toobr","br","thi","film","deal","thi","problem","racism","wai","frankenstein","deal","much","problem","bash","head","repeatedli","brutal","sluggish","manner","much","charact","cartoonish","onedimension","caricatur","lesbian","feminist","angri","black","man","react","situat","dramat","predict","possibl","instead","defi","stereotyp","thi","film","overpopul","angri","black","man","feel","cheat","feminist","hate","man","etc","feminist","even","hold","sign","read","dead","man","rape","see","mean","want","give","anyth","awai","thi","movi","someon","seem","like","shifti","lone","date","rapist","thei","probabl","behav","exactli","expect","chang","charact","go","seem","obviou","everyon","peopl","movi","big","twist","plot","hing","whether","violent","neonazi","act","like","violent","neonazi","guess","watch","find","happensbr","br","anoth","problem","thi","movi","suppos","gritti","hardhit","thei","make","nazi","bad","gui","agre","nazi","evil","point","everybodi","think","nazi","bad","re","break","ani","new","grind","nazi","portrai","villain","sinc","film","doe","challeng","ani","viewpoint","make","bold","statem","deal","issu","know","clumsi","afterschoolspeci","like","manner","antirap","antiracist","antinazi","exactli","take","hard","stanc","controversi","issuebr","br","high","learn","predict","cartoonish","word","stupid","avoid","cost"],"filtered2":["ye","peopl","racist","peopl","even","racist","colleg","good","point","issu","racism","deal","mani","time","befor","countless","set","high","learn","apart","pack","deal","issu","racism","hamfist","predict","wai","possibl","oh","ye","colleg","toobr","deal","problem","racism","wai","frankenstein","deal","problem","bash","head","repeatedli","brutal","sluggish","manner","charact","cartoonish","onedimension","caricatur","lesbian","feminist","angri","black","man","react","situat","dramat","predict","possibl","instead","defi","stereotyp","overpopul","angri","black","man","feel","cheat","feminist","hate","man","etc","feminist","even","hold","sign","read","dead","man","rape","see","mean","want","give","anyth","awai","someon","seem","like","shifti","lone","date","rapist","probabl","behav","exactli","expect","chang","charact","go","seem","obviou","everyon","peopl","big","twist","plot","hing","whether","violent","

{"value":"Since the Little Mermaid was one of my favorite Disney movies when I was little, I was curious about its sequel.<br /><br />The Little Mermaid(one) is a classic animated feature with top quality everything, a grand music score, and targets a general audience. In contrast, the Little Mermaid 2 is targeted primarily at young children, because it is spontaneous, reflects a child's self perspective, the music is bouncier and less dramatic, and the ending feels like recess.<br /><br />The Little Mermaid 2 starts out when baby Melody is presented to Ariel's side of the family. Abruptly without any visual cues to aid the drama, a giant tentacle grabs the baby. I laughed, wait a minute it's not funny, the baby's being attacked! Okay, I'll stop laughing. Morgana's crime in broad daylight and her spontaneity, takes away potential drama since it happened so quickly.<br /><br />Throughout the feature, Melody seems superhuman, which I defend is how most children envision themselves. This quality in Melody's character is clearly brought out toward the end when she fights Morgana without an inch of fear on her face.<br /><br />Like the first movie, Melody has a lot of Ariel's problems, except the reverse. Queen Ariel turns out to be like her father by restricting her from the ocean, whereas King Triton restricted Ariel from the surface. Ariel and Melody both rebel against their parent.<br /><br />The music is more emotionally moving in the first. This sequel has a bunch of songs, but not as much orchestral work went into it. It's great for little ones, because it doesn't take an orchestra to impress them.<br /><br />The ending in the first movie was strong and uplifting. The sequel ends with a bouncy song and everyone playing in the water. It's definitely more targeted at kids, because instead of the ending being solemn and leaving you blown away, this ending leaves you thinking, \"It's time for recess!\" Ultimately, this movie is fun for kids, so we should let them have

{"value":"Oh what a condescending movie! Set in Los Angeles, the center of the universe from the POV of Hollywood filmmakers, this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary American angst.<br /><br />Stereotyped, smarmy characters of widely varying socio-economic backgrounds cross paths in their everyday, humdrum lives. The plot is disjointed and desultory. Numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going, like: a drive-by shooting, an abandoned baby left in the weeds, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a kid at summer camp.<br /><br />And through all these events, the one constant is the generous helping of sociological \"insights\" imparted through the dialogue, as characters compare notes on their life experiences. One character tells another: \"When you sit on the edge of that thing (the Grand Canyon), you realize what a joke we people are; ... those rocks are laughing at me, I could tell, me and my worries; it's real humorous to that Grand Canyon\".<br /><br />And another character pontificates about the meaning of it all: \"There's a gulf in this country, an ever widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who don't have ... it's like this big hole has opened up in the ground, as big as the ... Grand Canyon, and what's come pouring out ... is an eruption of rage, and the rage creates violence ...\".<br /><br />Aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue, aside from the shallow, smarmy characters, aside from the dumb plot, the story's pace is agonizingly slow. Acting is uninspired and perfunctory. The film's tone is smug and self-satisfied, in the script's contempt for viewers.<br /><br />This was a film project approved by Hollywood suits who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus, looking down from on high. They think their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly, unknowing movie goers, eager to learn about the real meaning of American social change.","finished_norm":["oh","what","a","condescend","movi","set","in","lo","angel","the","center","of","the","univers","from","the","pov","of","hollywood","filmmak","thi","movi","try","to","be","a","deep","social","commentari","on","contemporari","american","angstbr","br","stereotyp","smarmi","charact","of","wide","vari","socioeconom","background","cross","path","in","their","everydai","humdrum","live","the","plot","be","disjoint","and","desultori","numer","unimagin","plot","contriv","keep","the","film","go","like","a","drivebi","shoot","a","abandon","babi","leav","in","the","we","a","gang","of","thug","intimid","a","lawyer","a","gui","fly","through","the","night","sky","over","the","citi","a","kid","at","summer","campbr","br","and","through","all","thi","event","the","on","constant","be","the","gener","help","of","sociolog","insight","impart","through","the","dialogu","a","charact","compar","note","on","their","life","experi","on","charact","tell","anoth","when","you","sit","on","the","edg","of","that","thing","the","grand","canyon","you","realiz","what","a","joke","we","peopl","be","that","rock","be","laugh","at","me","i","can","tell","me","and","my","worri","it","real","humor","to","that","grand","canyonbr","br","and","anoth","charact","pontif","about","the","mean","of","it","all","there","a","gulf","in","thi","countri","a","ever","widen","abyss","between","the","peopl","who","have","stuff","and","the","peopl","who","do","not","have","it","like","thi","big","hole","have","open","up","in","the","grind","a","big","a","the","grand","canyon","and","what","come","pour","out","be","a","erupt","of","rage","and","the","rage","creat","violenc","br","br","asid","from","the","horribli","unnatur","and","forc","dialogu","asid","from","the","shallow","smarmi","charact","asid","from","the","dumb","plot","the","stori","pace","be","agonizingli","slow","act","be","uninspir","and","perfunctori","the","film","tone","be","smug","and","selfsatisfi","in","the","script","contempt","for","viewersbr","br","thi","be","a","film","project","approv","by","hollywood","suit","who","fanci","themselv","a","omnipot","guru","look","down","from","on","high","thei","think","their","film","will","be","a","startl","revel","to","u","lowli","unknow","movi","goer","eager","to","learn","about","the","real","mean","of","american","social","chang"],"filtered":["oh","condescend","movi","set","lo","angel","center","univers","pov","hollywood","filmmak","thi","movi","try","deep","social","commentari","contemporari","american","angstbr","br","stereotyp","smarmi","charact","wide","vari","socioeconom","background","cross","path","everydai","humdrum","live","plot","disjoint","desultori","numer","unimagin","plot","contriv","keep","film","go","like","drivebi","shoot","abandon","babi","leav","gang","thug","intimid","lawyer","gui","fly","night","sky","citi","kid","summer","campbr","br","thi","event","constant","gener","help","sociolog","insight","impart","dialogu","charact","compar","note","life","experi","charact","tell","anoth","sit","edg","thing","grand","canyon","realiz","joke","peopl","rock","laugh","tell","worri","real","humor","grand","canyonbr","br","anoth","charact","pontif","mean","gulf","thi","countri","ever","widen","abyss","peopl","stuff","peopl","like","thi","big","hole","open","grind","big","grand","canyon","come","pour","erupt","rage","rage","creat","violenc","br","br","asid","horribli","unnatur","forc","dialogu","asid","shallow","smarmi","charact","asid","dumb","plot","stori","pace","agonizingli","slow","act","uninspir","perfunctori","film","tone","smug","selfsatisfi","script","contempt","viewersbr","br","thi","film","project","approv","hollywood","suit","fanci","themselv","omnipot","guru","look","high","thei","think","film","startl","revel","u","lowli","unknow","movi","goer","eager","learn","real","mean","american","social","chang"],"filtered2":["oh","condescend","set","lo","angel","center","univers","pov","hollywood","filmmak","try","deep","social","commentari","contemporari","american","angstbr","stereotyp","smarmi","charact","wide","vari","socioeconom","background","cross","path","everydai","humdrum","live","plot","disjoint","desultori","numer","unimagin","plot","contriv","keep","go","like","drivebi","shoot","abandon","babi","leav","gang","thug","intimid","lawyer","gui","fly","night","sky","citi","kid","summer","campbr","event","constant","gener","help","sociolog","insight","impart","dialogu","charact","compar","note","life","experi","charact","tell","anoth","sit","edg","thing","grand","canyon","realiz","joke","peopl","rock","laugh","tell","worri","real","humor","grand","canyonbr","anoth","charact","pontif","mean","gulf","countri","ever","widen","abyss","peopl","stuff","peopl","like","big","hole","open","grind","big","grand","canyon","come","pour","erupt","rage","rage","creat","violenc","asid","horribli","unnatur","forc","dialogu","asid","shallow","smarmi","charact","asid","dumb","plot","stori","pace","agonizingli","slow","act","uninspir

{"value":"When I heard that the Dukes of Hazzard was going to be remade with current actors and a solid script, I was like, \"alright, I'll give it a chance, it's not going to be better than the first, but we'll see what happens.\" Well, I saw what happened. I saw a great late 70's/80's show that was a classic, basically humiliated by Hollywood. It's so sad to see that Hollywood scriptwriters cannot come up with something original these days. They are seeming to take a great show that had a great target audience, and try to \"REMAKE\" the classic show. HEADS UP Hollywood... IT AIN'T WORKIN!!!! Anyway, more about the show. I think they could have casted a better actor than Sean William Scott (Stiffler from American Pie) to play Bo. I'm sure that John Schneider is definitely disappointed with how his character was portrayed and taken advantage of. Also, Get for real, Johnny Knoxville, as Luke Duke. How low can you go?? A crappy jackass actor to play lovable Luke. This sickens me. Also, I'll give Jessica Simpson is a beautiful woman, but her acting sucks. Catherine Bach who played the original Daisy, was smart, sexy, strong, opinionated and a good IL' southern girl. She was every little girls role model growing up! (I owned the doll and the Jeep - thank you very much!!!) Anyway, Jessica Simpson played a smart ass, 2-bit slut as Daisy Duke. Daisy never was blonde. Why did they have to cast her. Jessica Alba would have played a great Daisy Duke. She can speak with a great southern accent, and she is gorgeous, and would have done a wonderful job. Anyway, I'd like to say that this movie blew something fierce. I feel like I got ripped off by paying $8.50 for tickets, and they should refund my money. If you like the Dukes of Hazzard (the original series) don't see this movie. It'll just upset you. CMT (country music television) plays the reruns of the Dukes all the time later at night. So set your TIVO's and go with the real thing, not the imitation on the big screen in Hollywood.","finished_norm":["when","i","hear","that","the","duke","of","hazzard","be","go","to","be","remak","with","current","actor","and","a","solid","script","i","be","like","alright","i","will","give","it","a","chanc","it","not","go","to","be","well","than","the","but","we","will","see","what","happen","good","i","see","what","happen","i","see","a","great","late","show","that","be","a","classic","basic","humili","by","hollywood","it","so","sad","to","see","that","hollywood","scriptwrit","cannot","come","up","with","someth","origin","thi","dai","thei","be","seem","to","take","a","great","show","that","have","a","great","target","audienc","and","try","to","remak","the","classic","show","head","up","hollywood","it","ain","t","workin","anywai","much","about","the","show","i","think","thei","can","have","cast","a","well","actor","than","sean","william","scott","stiffler","from","american","pie","to","plai","bo","i","be","sure","that","john","schneider","be","definit","disappoint","with","how","hi","charact","be","portrai","and","take","advantag","of","conjur","get","for","real","johnni","knoxvil","a","luke","duke","how","low","can","you","go","a","crappi","jackass","actor","to","plai","lovabl","luke","thi","sicken","me","conjur","i","will","give","jessica","simpson","be","a","beauti","woman","but","her","act","suck","catherin","bach","who","plai","the","origin","daisi","be","smart","sexi","strong","opinion","and","a","good","il","southern","girl","she","be","everi","littl","girl","role","model","grow","up","i","own","the","doll","and","the","jeep","thank","you","veri","much","anywai","jessica","simpson","plai","a","smart","ass","bite","slut","a","daisi","duke","daisi","never","be","blond","why","do","thei","have","to","cast","her","jessica","alba","would","have","plai","a","great","daisi","duke","she","can","speak","with","a","great","southern","accent","and","she","be","gorgeou","and","would","have","do","a","wonder","job","anywai","i","have","like","to","sai","that","thi","movi","blow","someth","fierc","i","feel","like","i","get","rip","off","by","pai","for","ticket","and","thei","should","refund","my","monei","if","you","like","the","duke","of","hazzard","the","origin","seri","do","not","see","thi","movi","it","will","just","upset","you","cmt","countri","music","televis","plai","the","rerun","of","the","duke","all","the","time","late","at","night","so","set","your","tivo","and","go","with","the","real","thing","not","the","imit","on","the","big","screen","in","hollywood"],"filtered":["hear","duke","hazzard","go","remak","current","actor","solid","script","like","alright","give","chanc","go","well","see","happen","good","see","happen","see","great","late","show","classic","basic","humili","hollywood","sad","see","hollywood","scriptwrit","come","someth","origin","thi","dai","thei","seem","take","great","show","great","target","audienc","try","remak","classic","show","head","hollywood","ain","workin","anywai","much","show","think","thei","cast","well","actor","sean","william","scott","stiffler","american","pie","plai","bo","sure","john","schneider","definit","disappoint","hi","charact","portrai","take","advantag","conjur","get","real","johnni","knoxvil","luke","duke","low","go","crappi","jackass","actor","plai","lovabl","luke","thi","sicken","conjur","give","jessica","simpson","beauti","woman","act","suck","catherin","bach","plai","origin","daisi","smart","sexi","strong","opinion","good","il","southern","girl","everi","littl","girl","role","model","grow","doll","jeep","thank","veri","much","anywai","jessica","simpson","plai","smart","ass","bite","slut","daisi","duke","daisi","never","blond","thei","cast","jessica","alba","plai","great","daisi","duke","speak","great","southern","accent","gorgeou","wonder","job","anywai","like","sai","thi","movi","blow","someth","fierc","feel","like","get","rip","pai","ticket","thei","refund","monei","like","duke","hazzard","origin","seri","see","thi","movi","upset","cmt","countri","music","televis","plai","rerun","duke","time","late","night","set","tivo","go","real","thing","imit","big","screen","hollywood"],"filtered2":["hear","duke","hazzard","go","remak","current","actor","solid","script","like","alright","give","chanc","go","well","see","happen","good","see","happen","see","great","late","show","classic","basic","humili","hollywood","sad","see","hollywood","scriptwrit","come","someth","origin","dai","seem","take","great","show","great","target","audienc","try","remak","classic","show","head","hollywood","ain","workin","anywai","show","think","cast","well","actor","sean","william","scott","stiffler","american","pie","plai","bo","sure","john","schneider","definit","disappoint","charact","portrai","take","advantag","conjur","get","real","johnni","knoxvil","luke","duke","low","go","crappi","jackass","actor","plai","lovabl","luke","sicken","conjur","give","jessica","simpson","beauti","woman","act","suck","catherin","bach","plai","origin","daisi","smart","sexi","strong","opini

{"value":"Whoa nelly! I've heard a ton of mixed reviews for this...but one of my go to hardcore horror reviewers really found it to be disappointing. Man was he right on the nose! This movie was acted by pure amateurs. They HAD to have done one take, maybe two on each scene, the movie seemed soooo rushed. The script was also poor....they had lines that tried to be unique but failed. Miserably. \"Get your meathooks off of me!\" Oh man, I hate it when movies try to do that. It happens all the time with comedies...but, with a horror movie and with below average actors....the results are incredibly pathetic. The lines and scenarios were all very predictable. But what made me feel so negative towards this movie was, again, the damn acting. It was awful. Besides by the little Asian guy who worked the booth. I thought he was great.<br /><br />The movie is about 5 stupid dumbsh!t tourist who are on a vacation in Asia. They end up at the wrong place and fall into the hands of a mafia run sex/slaughterhouse. Sounds like a cool story. But watching someone with a bad case of diarrhea is probably more fun and intense to watch. The only reason this is considered horror is because of the killing. There wasn't a trace of suspense.<br /><br />I like many other horror fans were dying to get their bloody little mitts on this. But unfortunately with a HUGE capital U, the movie was incredibly disappointing. I did enjoy the ankle break and the blood effects. The flabby chicks were also so so.<br /><br />Everything about this movie screams amateur. This is Ryan Nicholson's first feature length, and for the most part he failed. There's no denying he has a sick sense of humor and taste for horror. I pray his next movie doesn't play out like another B horror flick...unless he tells us that's what it's gonna be. Even after this disappointment I'm willing to give Ryan another shot. From what I've seen of him, he's a true, dedicated man to the genre. Good luck next time, because this was bad

{"value":"I would not consider myself as one of Leonard Cohen's greatest fans. He does however feature as an important poet / musician in my literary / musical heritage. By far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear Leonard's reflections on his own life and career. Warming and humble. <br /><br />Unfortunately the most of the musicians featured in the concert didn't converse the nuances of Leonard's musical / literary manner. Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker & Beth Orton were the exceptions, even though Leonard highly values Rufus Wainrights interpretations of his songs.<br /><br />What particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who Leonard Cohen is and how these musicians connect to him. A lot is said in this respect, but the viewer is not drawn into the person Leonard Cohen. This failing is especially evident with the interviews with Bono and the Edge. They view Leonard as a special icon, but can't translate their exact value of Leonard Cohen. The collaboration with U2 is a farce. The entire live registration looks like a rushed job. And just as in the whole film, only Leonard Cohen remains his part and can tell about his own part.<br /><br />The entire montage and screenplay is much like a high school extramural project. The use of effects such as echo, slow-motion or flashed images are ill placed. Some of the camera-work is dismal. Part of the score hardly recalls any associations I may have expected. At times it seemed the filmmaker was adding psychotic elements to the film. Perhaps a reference to his once use of LSD.<br /><br />Some unintentional humor ... at some point Leonard tells how he influenced a musical genre.

{"value":"When evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of Ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the USA you must consider the following. The United States of America with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold Human Rights that it has its failings and downside. It is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated . On a per capita basis Europe, Britain and even Australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a per-capta basis the actual size of Neo-Nazi groups in Australia is actually higher than in the United States of America. It is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the American people and their level of debate in Educated American Society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra-right wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of American Society. By doing so Greenstreet, deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of America that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie. This film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the American people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and cliché idealist left wing ideology. This film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about American Society and the Human condition. Greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies, the Military Industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy.

{"value":"Twenty years ago, the five years old boy Michael Hawthorne witnessed his father killing his mother with an axe in an empty road and committing suicide later. On the present days, Michael (Gordon Currie) invites his girlfriend Peg (Stacy Grant) and his best friends Chris (Myc Agnew), Jennifer (Emmanuelle Vaugier), Lisa Ann (Kelly Benson), Ned (Brendon Beiser), Mitch Maldive (Phillip Rhys) and Trish (Rachel Hayward) to spend the Halloween in the country with his grandparents in their farm. He asks his friends to wear costumes that would represent their greatest innermost fear, and together with his Indian friend Crow (Byron Chief Moon), they would perform an ancient Indian celebration using the carved wooden dummy Morty (Jon Fedele) that would eliminate their fears forever. The greatest fear of Michael is to become a serial killer like his father, but something goes wrong and Morty turns into his father, killing his friends.<br /><br />\"The Fear: Resurrection\" is a disappointing and pointless slash movie that uses the interesting concept of eliminating the greatest innermost fear of each friend before it grows, but in a messy screenplay full of clichés. There are some exaggerated performances, like for example Ms. Betsy Palmer; others very weak, but in general the acting is good. Unfortunately there is no explanation why the dummy is brought to live; further, in spite of being surrounded by close friends, the group does not feel pain or sorrow when each one of them dies. The low-pace along more than fifty minutes could have been used to built a better dramatic situation. In the very end, Michael shows a charm that his father was interested that I have not noticed along the story. I do not know whether the previous reference was edited in the DVD released in Brazil with 87 minutes running time. The special effects are very reasonable for a B-movie.

{"value":"Once again, Disney manages to make a children's movie which totally ignores its background. About the only thing common with this and the original Gadget cartoons is the names. The most glaring errors are the characters - Penny does not have her book, Brain has been reduced from a character to a fancy prop, Dr Claw is more a show-off than an evil villain, etc. but there are more than that. The horrors start from the first minutes of the film - having Gadget as a security guard called John Brown doesn't help identifying him as the classic Inspector Gadget. And right in the beginning we see Disney's blatant attempt to turn every story ever into a love affair between a man and a woman - they introduce Brenda, who only serves to make this movie Disney-compatible. Add to this the fact that the \"Claw\" seen in this film and the classic Dr Claw are almost diagonally opposite and you'll see this is going to be nowhere near the original storyline. What would help would be a better storyline to replace it - but as you guessed, Disney failed in that too. The whole movie is just Gadget acting silly for silliness's sake and lusting after Brenda. As if to add insult to the injury, Disney introduced the \"new\" Gadgetmobile - it doesn't look, function or think like the old Gadgetmobile at all, it's just the canonical \"comic relief\" figure. Disney obviously recognised that the Gadget cartoons were a comedy, so they made the film a comedy too, but they took out all the clever running gags (like the assignment paper exploding in the Chief's face) and replaced them with Gadget being a moron, the Gadgetmobile being a wise-ass, and \"Claw\" showing off. Someone should tell Disney that \"children's movie\" doesn't imply \"total lack of any brain usage\". Gadget should be targeted for children of 10-12 years... not children of 10-12 months like this movie. Whatever this movie is supposed to be, it is NOT, repeat NOT, the real Inspector Gadget. Because I love the old Gadget, I hate this.","finished_norm":["onc","again","disnei","manag","to","make","a","child","movi","which","total","ignor","it","background","about","the","onli","thing","common","with","thi","and","the","origin","gadget","cartoon","be","the","name","the","much","glare","error","be","the","charact","penni","doe","not","have","her","book","brain","have","be","reduc","from","a","charact","to","a","fanci","prop","dr","claw","be","much","a","showoff","than","a","evil","villain","etc","but","there","be","much","than","that","the","horror","start","from","the","minut","of","the","film","have","gadget","a","a","secur","guard","call","john","brown","doe","not","help","identifi","him","a","the","classic","inspector","gadget","and","right","in","the","begin","we","see","disnei","blatant","attempt","to","turn","everi","stori","ever","into","a","love","affair","between","a","man","and","a","woman","thei","introduc","brenda","who","onli","serv","to","make","thi","movi","disneycompat","add","to","thi","the","fact","that","the","claw","see","in","thi","film","and","the","classic","dr","claw","be","almost","diagon","opposit","and","you","will","see","thi","be","go","to","be","nowher","near","the","origin","storylin","what","would","help","would","be","a","well","storylin","to","replac","it","but","a","you","guess","disnei","fail","in","that","too","the","whole","movi","be","just","gadget","act","silli","for","silli","sake","and","lust","after","brenda","a","if","to","add","insult","to","the","injuri","disnei","introduc","the","new","gadgetmobil","it","doe","not","look","function","or","think","like","the","old","gadgetmobil","at","all","it","just","the","canon","comic","relief","figur","disnei","obvious","recognis","that","the","gadget","cartoon","be","a","comedi","so","thei","make","the","film","a","comedi","too","but","thei","take","out","all","the","clever","run","gag","like","the","assign","paper","explod","in","the","chief","face","and","replac","them","with","gadget","be","a","moron","the","gadgetmobil","be","a","wiseass","and","claw","show","off","someon","should","tell","disnei","that","child","movi","doe","not","impli","total","lack","of","ani","brain","usag","gadget","should","be","target","for","child","of","year","not","child","of","month","like","thi","movi","whatev","thi","movi","be","suppos","to","be","it","be","not","repeat","not","the","real","inspector","gadget","becaus","i","love","the","old","gadget","i","hate","thi"],"filtered":["onc","disnei","manag","make","child","movi","total","ignor","background","onli","thing","common","thi","origin","gadget","cartoon","name","much","glare","error","charact","penni","doe","book","brain","reduc","charact","fanci","prop","dr","claw","much","showoff","evil","villain","etc","much","horror","start","minut","film","gadget","secur","guard","call","john","brown","doe","help","identifi","classic","inspector","gadget","right","begin","see","disnei","blatant","attempt","turn","everi","stori","ever","love","affair","man","woman","thei","introduc","brenda","onli","serv","make","thi","movi","disneycompat","add","thi","fact","claw","see","thi","film","classic","dr","claw","almost","diagon","opposit","see","thi","go","nowher","near","origin","storylin","help","well","storylin","replac","guess","disnei","fail","whole","movi","gadget","act","silli","silli","sake","lust","brenda","add","insult","injuri","disnei","introduc","new","gadgetmobil","doe","look","function","think","like","old","gadgetmobil","canon","comic","relief","figur","disnei","obvious","recognis","gadget","cartoon","comedi","thei","make","film","comedi","thei","take","clever","run","gag","like","assign","paper","explod","chief","face","replac","gadget","moron","gadgetmobil","wiseass","claw","show","someon","tell","disnei","child","movi","doe","impli","total","lack","ani","brain","usag","gadget","target","child","year","child","month","like","thi","movi","whatev","thi","movi","suppos","repeat","real","inspector","gadget","becaus","love","old","gadget","hate","thi"],"filtered2":["onc","disnei","manag","make","child","total","ignor","background","onli","thing","common","origin","gadget","cartoon","name","glare","error","charact","penni","doe","book","brain","reduc","charact","fanci","prop","dr","claw","showoff","evil","villain","etc","horror","start","minut","gadget","secur","guard","call","john","brown","doe","help","identifi","classic","inspector","gadget","right","begin","see","disnei","blatant","attempt","turn","everi","stori","ever","love","affair","man","woman","introduc","brenda","onli","serv","make","disneycompat","add","fact","claw","see","classic","dr","claw","almost","diagon","opposit","see","go","nowher","near","origin","storylin","help","well","storylin","replac","guess","disnei","fail","whole","gadget","act","silli","silli","sake","lust","brenda","add","insult","injuri","disnei","introduc","new","gadgetmobil","doe","look","function","think","like","old","gadgetmobil","canon","comic","relief","figur","disnei","obvious"

{"value":"Do you guys wanna know a secret?. This movie sucks. Well actually i don't know because if you allow yourself to be indulged by plagiarised versions of original movies, then perhaps you may find this movie astounding (this movie being a plagiarised copy of i know what you did last summer). The first 30 minutes of the movie is based on a typical story setting; a bunch of so-called cool teenagers relishing their vacation in Florida and being themselves by behaving very much like the juveniles they are. The only insight we get at this point is the extent to which the director succeeded in illustrating a pretentious sense of adolescent decadence within the characters. The second half hour of the movie gains a little momentum and begins to illustrate a start to the no- where-near unprecedented killings. The third half hour of the movie will most definitely remain a mystery to me because i switched it off before i could further delude myself into thinking that the movie may still have something interesting and original left to show. As far as the story is concerned, it can easily be explained in a few lines. A bunch of teenagers go to Florida on vacation. While they are busy partying, they slowly (and i mean SLOWLY) begin to get killed because they know some sort of silly secret. The only thread to the killings is that all victims were matriculates of a common high school. One thing that did however amaze me about this movie, was how much betty (im not sure about her name..the blonde character) looks like reese witherspoon. Another thing that amazed me about the movie was that it made me jump from my seat a few times. Does that make it a work of art? absolutely not because my 12 year old niece made me drop a glass of orange juice because she \"boo'ed\" me when i was just about to go through the guest room door..whats the difference between the director and my 12 year old niece???? <br /><br />Do you wanna know a secret???

{"value":"A large part of the scenes should be cut off. There is a lot of scenes that should have been cut off. For example the scene where the hunters mentions \"I got spiders on my dick\", \"I like dick\", playing in the mud scene, or a bar scene where a professional dinocroc hunters main job is a snake charmer.<br /><br />How about other terribly incoherent scenes featuring a woman, Diane who wants to loose her virginity to a boyfriend who walks like he wears women's panties three sizes too small. While they make love, didn't they realized they are making it out next to the little boy who will soon run away and loose his head? Why did they do in a living room? I mean his head really flipped. How about the beach scene very reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Jaws scene at Grant Lake. All these strange scene could easily be re-dubbed and billed as a comedy.<br /><br />Here in my local town, the cineplex theaters had been advertising for months about Dinocroc, and I am glad I didn't watch it because I later found out it was shown only for 1 or 2 days before it was canceled. The movie was THAT bad. I suspected that Dinocroc was not a good movie looking at the preview. It features the leg of Dinocroc that looks like a child wearing green pajamas and slippers with claws and walks up and down like a 2 year old. It could easily passed over as Baby Geniuses.<br /><br />If any students of movie making wants to learn what not to do this is a real classic trash. Such as Diane's boyfriend who walks like he had an advanced case of syphilis makes you wonder what the poor woman sees in this guy who looks drunk even before he get to drink beer. When this happens, who cares about Dinocroc? The panties man looked more more interesting than the entire movie of Dinocroc. His acting was so bad, he makes a much better replacement for Mr. Bean. MOVE OVER ROWAN ATKINSON, here is a man with a better comedic talent in a horror sci-fi flick. Perhaps the worse casting in the history of

{"value":"Despite what a lot of other people thought about the first movie, I really liked it. This one however. How to sum it up in one word?: This movie is (and here comes the word): CRAP!<br /><br />But let's look at it part by part: Here is the plot: Finally the old queen has been removed from her castle, but her successor: Snow white has problems of another sort: The Court-Jester, Father of her son, has gone astray, as the super, Spliss, goes to the extreme, to battle his gray hair and sells the royal offspring for some blond and full hair. In her desperation Snow white seeks the help of Bubi (Otto Walkees),who must first find his other six dwarf companions and then try to find the royal offspring or at least try to find the name of Rumpelstiltskin.<br /><br />The whole plot seems to have been written on a weekend, where the writers were very drunk but were just under pressure from the studio to write the screenplay. <br /><br />Yes, there are some good jokes. Even for fans of the first part, or for fans of any of the other actors, it's really not worth buying the the DVD. Believe me. <br /><br />The only thing, that at least kind of saves the movie from complete oblivion, are the performances of some of the actors. That's why I gave the move 3/10. Sadly, the script is so bad that none of the actors or all of them combined can make up for the bad story.<br /><br />For example, at one point, they even cross over in our reality, and sadly.. they don't do anything funny while being here. <br /><br />Still, a lot of great actors in this movie: Otto Waalkes, Ralf Schmitz, Martin Schneider, Nina Hagen, Cosma Shiva Hagen, (Especially funny): Rüdiger Hoffmann as the mirror, Helge Schneider and many more but sadly all these comedians aren't able to bring this really bad script to life. <br /><br />Maybe it is a treat for some hardcore fans but for regular movie goers or by now DVD Renters or buyers it's not worth the money. <br /><br />I even regret renting the movie.","finished_norm":["despit","what","a","lot","of","other","peopl","think","about","the","movi","i","realli","like","it","thi","on","howev","how","to","sum","it","up","in","on","word","thi","movi","be","and","here","come","the","word","crapbr","br","but","let","look","at","it","part","by","part","here","be","the","plot","final","the","old","queen","have","be","remov","from","her","castl","but","her","successor","snow","white","have","problem","of","anoth","sort","the","courtjest","father","of","her","son","have","go","astrai","a","the","super","spliss","go","to","the","extrem","to","battl","hi","grai","hair","and","sell","the","royal","offspr","for","some","blond","and","full","hair","in","her","desper","snow","white","seek","the","help","of","bubi","otto","walkeeswho","must","find","hi","other","six","dwarf","companion","and","then","try","to","find","the","royal","offspr","or","at","littl","try","to","find","the","name","of","rumpelstiltskinbr","br","the","whole","plot","seem","to","have","be","write","on","a","weekend","where","the","writer","be","veri","drink","but","be","just","under","pressur","from","the","studio","to","write","the","screenplai","br","br","ye","there","be","some","good","joke","even","for","fan","of","the","part","or","for","fan","of","ani","of","the","other","actor","it","realli","not","worth","bui","the","the","dvd","believ","me","br","br","the","onli","thing","that","at","littl","kind","of","save","the","movi","from","complet","oblivion","be","the","perform","of","some","of","the","actor","that","why","i","give","the","move","sadli","the","script","be","so","bad","that","none","of","the","actor","or","all","of","them","combin","can","make","up","for","the","bad","storybr","br","for","exampl","at","on","point","thei","even","cross","over","in","our","realiti","and","sadli","thei","do","not","do","anyth","funni","while","be","here","br","br","still","a","lot","of","great","actor","in","thi","movi","otto","waalk","ralf","schmitz","martin","schneider","nina","hagen","cosma","shiva","hagen","especi","funni","rüdiger","hoffmann","a","the","mirror","helg","schneider","and","mani","much","but","sadli","all","thi","comedian","be","not","abl","to","bring","thi","realli","bad","script","to","life","br","br","mayb","it","be","a","treat","for","some","hardcor","fan","but","for","regular","movi","goer","or","by","now","dvd","renter","or","buyer","it","not","worth","the","monei","br","br","i","even","regret","rent","the","movi"],"filtered":["despit","lot","peopl","think","movi","realli","like","thi","howev","sum","word","thi","movi","come","word","crapbr","br","let","look","part","part","plot","final","old","queen","remov","castl","successor","snow","white","problem","anoth","sort","courtjest","father","son","go","astrai","super","spliss","go","extrem","battl","hi","grai","hair","sell","royal","offspr","blond","full","hair","desper","snow","white","seek","help","bubi","otto","walkeeswho","must","find","hi","six","dwarf","companion","try","find","royal","offspr","littl","try","find","name","rumpelstiltskinbr","br","whole","plot","seem","write","weekend","writer","veri","drink","pressur","studio","write","screenplai","br","br","ye","good","joke","even","fan","part","fan","ani","actor","realli","worth","bui","dvd","believ","br","br","onli","thing","littl","kind","save","movi","complet","oblivion","perform","actor","give","move","sadli","script","bad","none","actor","combin","make","bad","storybr","br","exampl","point","thei","even","cross","realiti","sadli","thei","anyth","funni","br","br","still","lot","great","actor","thi","movi","otto","waalk","ralf","schmitz","martin","schneider","nina","hagen","cosma","shiva","hagen","especi","funni","rüdiger","hoffmann","mirror","helg","schneider","mani","much","sadli","thi","comedian","abl","bring","thi","realli","bad","script","life","br","br","mayb","treat","hardcor","fan","regular","movi","goer","dvd","renter","buyer","worth","monei","br","br","even","regret","rent","movi"],"filtered2":["despit","lot","peopl","think","realli","like","howev","sum","word","come","word","crapbr","let","look","part","part","plot","final","old","queen","remov","castl","successor","snow","white","problem","anoth","sort","courtjest","father","son","go","astrai","super","spliss","go","extrem","battl","grai","hair","sell","royal","offspr","blond","full","hair","desper","snow","white","seek","help","bubi","otto","walkeeswho","must","find","six","dwarf","companion","try","find","royal","offspr","littl","try","find","name","rumpelstiltskinbr","whole","plot","seem","write","weekend","writer","veri","drink","pressur","studio","write","screenplai","ye","good","joke","even","fan","part","fan","ani","actor","realli","worth","bui","dvd","believ","onli","thing","littl","kind","save","complet","oblivion","perform","actor","give","move","sadli","script","bad","none","actor","combin","make","bad","storybr","exampl","point","even","cross","realiti","sadli","anyth","funni","still","lot","gr

{"value":"I received this movie as a gift, I knew from the DVD cover, this movie are going to be bad.After not watching it for more than a year I finally watched it. what a pathetic movie.<br /><br />I almost didn't finish watching this bad movie,but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie.<br /><br />Trust me when I say \" this movie sucks\" I am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wane bee got even financed to make this pathetic movie, But it couldn't have cost more than $20 000 to produce this movie. all you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera .about 15 people with no acting skills, a scrip that were written by a couple of drunk people.<br /><br />In the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter (Tara Woodley )run a suppose to be drunk man over on her way to report on a hunted town. He are completely unharmed. They went to a supposed to be abandon house ,but luckily for the it almost complete furnished and a bottle of liquor on the door step happens to be there. just for the supposed to be drunk man but all is not what it seems.<br /><br />Then the supposed drunk man start telling Tara ghost/zombies stories.<br /><br />The fist of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.<br /><br />his story<br /><br />Sgt. Ben Draper let one of his soldiers die of complete exhaustion (I think this is what happens)after letting the poor soldier private Wilson do sit ups he let him dig a grave and then the soldier collapse ,Ben Draper<br /><br />buries him in a shallow grave.<br /><br />But Sgt. Ben Draper are in for n big surprise. his wife/girl fiend knows about this and she and her lover kills Sgt.

{"value":"This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. From the plot, though the shots, the \"special effects\", the acting, and did I mentioned the plot? Every single thing in it sucked ass!<br /><br />This is a good example of what \"over-doing\" means and I'll try to explain:<br /><br />I understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do; this was supposed to be one of those movies you can't really tell what the hell is going on up until the end. You sit mesmerized, not knowing who's dead and who's alive and who killed who and why and just when you think you got the timeline right you find out you're wrong and the movie ends - leaving you with an opened mouth for the next 5 minutes! Something like \"Unbreakable\" or \"The Job\" if you know what I mean.<br /><br />But Olga Levens, the writer of this junk, yes, Olga  The writer, Director, Producer, Screenplay author, Caster, Production designer, Art Director, Costume Designer and also a double for one of the characters is some scenes... this is basically a one woman movie and when it comes to Olga Levens from \"Levens Productions\" you can't go wrong :-)<br /><br />Well this might come as a shocker but \"this time\" Olga over did this big time, jumping from scene to scene, from dreams to reality... but wait! this was all a dream after all... or was it??? The picture fades and I realized none of this ever happened, the girl was all alone on the ship... actually there was no ship... no wait! There's the ship again, and the guys! They're alive! Thank god! No they're calling her to join the cruise... but then the ship disappears so maybe they're dead after all??? or maybe they never were alive to begin with???<br /><br />If you understood what I just said you might like this movie - otherwise it's a boring piece of work and the only reason I set through this entire crap is to find out how the hell can they finish this movie...<br /><br />Don't

{"value":"This is the 2nd time I've seen this movie in about 12 years. These remarks come from someone who finds Kane and Ambersons to be amazing, worthy films. But the remainder of Welles career is, unfortunately, squandered on material unworthy of his talent and too flimsy to withstand his filmic embroidering. And when he makes a potboiler like Shanghai, the lack of anything substantial to hang his filmic tricks on, is just kind of sad. I couldn't tell you what he was exploring here. It's all as mannered as Welle's godawful Irish brogue; which takes a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the film. Several Welles projects became this overdeveloped and baroque. Mr Arkadin (pick a version, any version) is a similarly belabored project. The material is inconsequential. It just can't bear the weight of all this noodling. For a director trafficking in reality-based drama (as here), he never feels any pull to tie his bundle of conceits back to reality; or to a coherent story. The murder-for-hire scheme is ridiculous. <br /><br />Kudos to Welles though, for having Hayworth cut her hair, and getting that performance out of her. The camera loves her. She's the classiest, most upscale, sultry and ravishing femme fatale ever put on film. But her treachery comes so late in the film it feels like some desperate decision, made so the movie will have some genre it fits into. The movie can't be saved by a noir convention deployed in the last 60 seconds.<br /><br />When all is said and done in L.F.S., the convolutions are all for what?; to convince you you've seen something thoughtful? to give Welles more to do? to make you roll your eyes? Welles has no sensitivity to the scale of a story, or to telling a story directly. One wonders what Shanghai has to say to anyone who isn't a crippled billionaire, arranging a quadruple-cross murder-for-hire scheme, or a fanboy in love with filmic conceits devoid of meaning or

{"value":"Honestly, I went to see the movie, not because of the actors, not because of the plot but because it was rated 17 here in Luxembourg and a movie has to be really brutal or pornographic to be put in this category. Believe me, being a movie-freak, I have seen quite a lot of brutal films in my lifetime (Ichi the killer, Irreversible, Hellraiser) but this movie was by far the most disturbing and brutal picture I have ever seen. <br /><br />The plot is plain stupid, the directing is awful, acting was mediocre even the music was a cheap copy of so-called \"Horror Soundtracks\". There isn't a single intelligent aspect in the whole movie, and some of the scenes are really hard to stand. (especially the scene, where you see the embryos in the glasses and hear the baby cries--horrible). I can't understand why the movie was rated 16 in Germany, where normally the criteria are real tough (e.g. kill-bill (brutal but it made fun of itself and had great allusions to Asian cinema and besides a magnificent directing) even a movie like state of grace is rated 18). No one can call this a Horror movie, because actually it was more about showing gore than about scaring the public (Showing the \"Creep's\" face in the middle of the movie was a very bad decision); for me (excuse my expression) it is just one insane director living out his disturbing fantasies. In some scenes you see violence, that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot nor does it explain anything. The plot has holes and flaws, the dialog is boring, honestly I can't mention a single positive aspect of the movie except for the British and Scottish accent.<br /><br />If I had something to say, I would ban this movie from the theaters, I fully understand why none of the big production companies invested their money in this crap.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to getting feedbacks to my thread

{"value":"What was the worst movie of 2003? \"Cat in the Hat?\" \"Gigli?\" Mais non! I propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year. Badly written, badly edited, and (if I may be so bold) badly acted, \"The Order\" is the black hole of film - a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck. It isn't even accidentally funny, like (for example) \"Showgirls.\"<br /><br />You know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn't going to be very smart. They renamed the movie, originally titled \"The Sin Eaters,\" because they figured Americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was, even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie. Instead, they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of Heath Ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there.<br /><br />And, hey, what do you know, they were right! My ex-girlfriend saw the picture of Heath and dragged me in. Congratulations, producers, you've met your target market. She also liked \"Grease II,\" so you're in good company.<br /><br />Back on topic, Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific (you guessed it) order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor. He has celibacy issues, possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion, much less be a celibate monk. The only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy. As much as I've wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen, his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of Monty Python, thinking that if they just said the lines like the Pythons did they would automatically be funny. You know the sort of people I'm talking about.<br /><br />If I utter any more, I would be in danger of generating spoilers.

{"value":"Feh. This movie started out in an interesting manner, but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull. The confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning, where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so. The dull comes later, with a tepid romance between the two living people(pusses both). The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film, which is sad. If the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber, the movie might have been better.<br /><br />Maybe. Because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile, as it appears that the insane priestess mother of the dead sixteen year old girl is trying to resurrect her daughter from the dead, with the decidedly unfortunate side effect that all of the other dead people would come back as well, take on solid human form, and most likely start killing off everybody. A sort of Japanese mystical Night of the Living Dead type thing. But this doesn't come to pass. Even though this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket strapped to his head tells the uninteresting young people that this will come to pass if the priestess finishes her ritual, she does just that and the only dead person who manifests is her daughter. No mass rising of the dead, no walking army of corpses, nothing. The priest merely makes the girl's spirit go back to the land of the dead, taking the washed out wuss of a boyfriend with her, as she'd crushed his spine like peanut brittle(at which point I was tempted to cheer loudly, as this idiot went over to kiss and fondle the DEAD girl,,ewwww!!!). The Robitussen sucking, spineless best friend has a long introspective shot at the end as she leaves the village for the last time, and that's it. No real horror, no real creepiness, which the Japanese tend to do far better than American film makers with their emphasis on over-the-top cheesy face make-up, no screaming mimis. I was very

{"value":"When I saw this film on FearNet, I thought it would be a scary movie. Apparently, it wasn't. I have no clue how this movie was allowed to be featured on that site. FearNet is a site that shows scary horror movies.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful from all the actors. I hated the story. The story was stupid. The movie starts out with a man with a scroll with a signia stamped onto it. He breaks the seal and certain disasters happen. The water turns to blood, the oceans die out, the moon turns red, etc. <br /><br />The female character was annoying as well. A lot of the stuff she did didn't make sense. Like when she sees a piece of paper with a date on it. Coincidentally, it's the date she's expected to give birth to her baby and she starts freaking out about it and starts researching it and asking religious people what it all means.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert* <br /><br />The two worst things happened in this movie are the execution of a mentally retarded man who claimed that God told him to murder his parents and the end where Demi Moore dies after giving birth to her baby and transferring her soul into it.<br /><br />Here's what happens. The mentally retarded person gets shot and killed and the apocalypse begins. Demi Moore gets into a hospital in the middle of a massive earthquake and gives birth to her child. She touches her child's head, transferring her soul into the child and then dies. Then, the apocalypse stops.<br /><br />Why does God all of a sudden have a change of heart? He gets furious when the Governor allows the execution of a mentally retarded man then he's all about forgiveness once a lone woman transfers her soul into her baby? <br /><br />*End Spoiler* <br /><br />The movie is pretty stupid. It's another religious end of the world propaganda piece. The acting from Demi Moore and Michael Biehn and everybody else is excellent. That's about all there is.<br /><br />I give this movie 2 stars out of 10.
