{"value":"Standard procedure for Swedish movies today seem to be to start by throwing plausibility out the window and continue down that path for the rest of the process. Rånarna is another fine example of a movie making very little sense.<br /><br />Banks in Stockholm are being robbed by a highly efficient \"military-styled\" gang of robbers. Two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first.<br /><br />As usual in Swedish film the cast is mostly made up of the same people you have seen over and over again. Mikael Persbrandt must be in every Swedish film from the last few years! But that's OK i guess since Persbrandt is one of few that performs solidly here (like he usually does). The problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself. First of all the robberies feel mostly like background. Rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world (like that has not been made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of Sofia Helin). Also there is a completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about as plausible as Aliens landing. But still, i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then. It spiced things up a bit (and actually saved the rating from dropping another step).<br /><br />In the end the main problem is the same thing as with most other Swedish movies of this kind. Simply that the action and suspense doesn't live up to the standards we are used to from other movies of this kind (mostly Hollywood). It feels cheap and rather weak in comparison. In my opinion Swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting, and forget about trying to make \"Hollywood-action light\" like they do now. Because this becomes yet another forgettable effort from the Swedish movie-industry. I rate it 3/10.","finished_norm":["standard","procedur","for","swedish","movi","todai","seem","to","be","to","start","by","throw","plausibl","out","the","window","and","continu","down","that","path","for","the","rest","of","the","process","rånarna","be","anoth","fine","exampl","of","a","movi","make","veri","littl","sensebr","br","bank","in","stockholm","be","be","rob","by","a","highli","effici","militarystyl","gang","of","robber","two","polic","offic","start","investig","the","case","that","soon","becom","much","complic","than","it","would","appear","at","firstbr","br","a","usual","in","swedish","film","the","cast","be","mostli","make","up","of","the","same","peopl","you","have","see","over","and","over","again","mikael","persbrandt","must","be","in","everi","swedish","film","from","the","last","few","year","but","that","okai","i","guess","sinc","persbrandt","be","on","of","few","that","perform","solidli","here","like","he","usual","doe","the","problem","with","thi","film","mostli","revolv","around","the","stori","itself","of","all","the","robberi","feel","mostli","like","background","rather","thi","be","much","a","movi","about","a","young","policewoman","fight","to","prove","herself","in","a","male","world","like","that","have","not","be","make","a","thousand","time","befor","with","a","decent","actress","instead","of","sofia","helin","conjur","there","be","a","complet","unbeliev","plot","twist","near","the","end","that","seem","about","a","plausibl","a","alien","land","but","still","i","do","think","it","be","a","quit","nice","touch","consid","i","be","half","asleep","right","about","then","it","spice","thing","up","a","bite","and","actual","save","the","rate","from","drop","anoth","stepbr","br","in","the","end","the","main","problem","be","the","same","thing","a","with","much","other","swedish","movi","of","thi","kind","simpli","that","the","action","and","suspens","doe","not","live","up","to","the","standard","we","be","us","to","from","other","movi","of","thi","kind","mostli","hollywood","it","feel","cheap","and","rather","weak","in","comparison","in","my","opinion","swedish","filmmak","should","try","to","focu","much","on","plot","and","act","and","forget","about","try","to","make","hollywoodact","light","like","thei","do","now","becaus","thi","becom","yet","anoth","forgett","effort","from","the","swedish","movieindustri","i","rate","it"],"filtered":["standard","procedur","swedish","movi","todai","seem","start","throw","plausibl","window","continu","path","rest","process","rånarna","anoth","fine","exampl","movi","make","veri","littl","sensebr","br","bank","stockholm","rob","highli","effici","militarystyl","gang","robber","two","polic","offic","start","investig","case","soon","becom","much","complic","appear","firstbr","br","usual","swedish","film","cast","mostli","make","peopl","see","mikael","persbrandt","must","everi","swedish","film","last","year","okai","guess","sinc","persbrandt","perform","solidli","like","usual","doe","problem","thi","film","mostli","revolv","around","stori","robberi","feel","mostli","like","background","rather","thi","much","movi","young","policewoman","fight","prove","male","world","like","make","thousand","time","befor","decent","actress","instead","sofia","helin","conjur","complet","unbeliev","plot","twist","near","end","seem","plausibl","alien","land","still","think","quit","nice","touch","consid","half","asleep","right","spice","thing","bite","actual","save","rate","drop","anoth","stepbr","br","end","main","problem","thing","much","swedish","movi","thi","kind","simpli","action","suspens","doe","live","standard","us","movi","thi","kind","mostli","hollywood","feel","cheap","rather","weak","comparison","opinion","swedish","filmmak","try","focu","much","plot","act","forget","try","make","hollywoodact","light","like","thei","becaus","thi","becom","yet","anoth","forgett","effort","swedish","movieindustri","rate"],"filtered2":["standard","procedur","swedish","todai","seem","start","throw","plausibl","window","continu","path","rest","process","rånarna","anoth","fine","exampl","make","veri","littl","sensebr","bank","stockholm","rob","highli","effici","militarystyl","gang","robber","two","polic","offic","start","investig","case","soon","becom","complic","appear","firstbr","usual","swedish","cast","mostli","make","peopl","see","mikael","persbrandt","must","everi","swedish","last","year","okai","guess","sinc","persbrandt","perform","solidli","like","usual","doe","problem","mostli","revolv","around","stori","robberi","feel","mostli","like","background","rather","young","policewoman","fight","prove","male","world","like","make","thousand","time","befor","decent","actress","instead","sofia","helin","conjur","complet","unbeliev","plot","twist","near","end","seem","plausibl","alien","land","still","think","quit","nice","touch","consid","half","asleep","right","spice","thing","bite","actual","save","rate","drop","anoth","stepbr","end","main","problem","thing","swedish","kind","simpli","action","susp

{"value":"The Horror Channel plays nothing but erotic soft porn Gothic flicks each night from 10pm till about 4 in the morning, but their 'scare' factor is very limited, if one exists at all. In fact I am sure I will find a multi-million pound lottery win more scary than anything this channel has to offer.<br /><br />The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance deserves special mention because it is I feel, the undisputed low of a channel full of lows. I cannot even begin to tell you how bad this film is, but for the purpose of completing the minimum 10 lines demanded by this site, I will at least give it a go.<br /><br />Firstly the title is misleading and bears no resemblance to the action on the screen. In fact the film might as well have been called 'Toothbrush' or 'Wallpaper' for all it has to do with the plot. At least they used toothbrushes...at least they had wallpaper.<br /><br />There are no bloodsuckers for miles around and whats even worse there are no dances, not one. I'm sure they were making two different films by mistake here.<br /><br />A more suitable title would have been, 'Horny Italian Count Leads Five People to a Scary Castle and Bores us Silly for Ninety Minutes.' Yes that fits better.<br /><br />The acting is terrible and and the dubbing appalling, and that guy who plays Seymour was almost as wooden in his walk as he was in his character....abysmal.<br /><br />The only saving graces of this film are a small but slightly interesting lesbian sex scene, two small and very interesting heterosexual sex scenes, and the added attraction in that every single female character gets her kit off. Bonus.<br /><br />Otherwise steer a wide birth away from this one.

{"value":"I had high expectations following \"My Beautiful Laundrette\", \"Bend it like Beckham\" and (less so) \"East is East\". The histories of British Asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent TV and radio series (Goodness gracious me, etc). This one falls flat. Inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill.<br /><br />Ultimately this was a horribly typical BBC effort, complete with strong regional accents, whacky over-acting characters, a \"those were the days\" soundtrack, and lots of \"issues\" in an attempt to be worthy.<br /><br />I found myself cringing at many points during this film. The writing is predictable. Every possible cliche was dragged out and aired. In fact, I have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural/cross-generational devices that could have been used that weren't. The characters were thin and cliched: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the over weight, overbearing aunt; the pushy Indian parents; the working class neighbour; the 'wise' profound grandmother; the motorbike riding thug. The script was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken. And why it had to be set in the 70's (apart from needing an excuse for a 70's soundtrack) is a mystery. Possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979. I don't know.<br /><br />Even these things aside, good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity. Instead, the usual \"BBC comedy\" suspects were wheeled out to ham it up. \"Bend it like Beckham\" had far better comic acting (and serious acting, in fact) than this, with a virtually unknown cast.<br /><br />In summary, a lazy cliched script, over acted, in a dull predictable story.

{"value":"Where do you begin with a movie as bad as this?<br /><br />Do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes? The over-the-top acting? The dreadful script?<br /><br />No. You just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at. I know I do. I respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like Empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy isn't available to the quality movie mags). However, cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer isn't happy with the finished product.<br /><br />I went three days after it opened with two other mates. The only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own.<br /><br />And that was on cheap night.<br /><br />Either the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is.<br /><br />Not since the days of The Avengers (1998) have I felt so short changed since watching a movie. If a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it.<br /><br />Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up - or walking off the set; Keith Allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage; Barry Foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance, Rhys Ifans does his career no favours after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary.<br /><br />Mind you, considering she used to be in The Word, any viewers' expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with.<br /><br />The production values aren't bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious. If you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say \"Fak!\" for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street.<br /><br />Otherwise, bargepoles required.<br /><br

{"value":"Life in some future fascist or near fascist state which severely restricts personal freedoms is a recurrent theme both in modern literature and for film makers. Such works post us warnings about undesirable trends in our society to watch out for; but to be effective they must also be entertaining. Unfortunately most of the books are probably more effective in posting the warnings than in entertaining us enough to become really widely read; whilst with the films the problem is usually the other way round. The first such work to become really widely known was probably George Orwell's \"1984\" (first published in 1948), and this is still readily available both in the form of a book and as a film.<br /><br />Watch or read it: and then, when you are feeling a little depressed by man's inhumanity to man, reach for Cinderella 2000. This is a feather light low budget film comedy based on the same theme which provides effortless but unrewarding viewing; and as with 1984 the calendar has now passed beyond its erstwhile period. Most of the comedy is laid on with a trowel although there are just a few genuinely funny moments. To exercise your mind in the long intervals between these you can focus it on the question of whether this film will gain a new extension of life by being released as a DVD or whether it will finally disappear into oblivion as existing tape copies deteriorate past redemption. There are many worse films appearing as DVD's these days, and frankly I do not care much what happens either way.<br /><br />So far the best of the films of this genre has probably been \"The Handmaiden's Tale\", but I would very happily swap them all for a well made film of Jack London's towering novel \"The Iron Heel\". Ambitious as this would be, it still seems incredible that no modern film maker has yet dared to attempt it (IMDb only lists a B/W silent version made in Russia in 1919).","finished_norm":["life","in","some","futur","fascist","or","near","fascist","state","which","sever","restrict","person","freedom","be","a","recurr","theme","both","in","modern","literatur","and","for","film","maker","such","work","post","u","warn","about","undesir","trend","in","our","societi","to","watch","out","for","but","to","be","effect","thei","must","conjur","be","entertain","unfortun","much","of","the","book","be","probabl","much","effect","in","post","the","warn","than","in","entertain","u","enough","to","becom","realli","wide","read","whilst","with","the","film","the","problem","be","usual","the","other","wai","round","the","such","work","to","becom","realli","wide","know","be","probabl","georg","orwel","publish","in","and","thi","be","still","readili","avail","both","in","the","form","of","a","book","and","a","a","filmbr","br","watch","or","read","it","and","then","when","you","be","feel","a","littl","depress","by","man","inhuman","to","man","reach","for","cinderella","thi","be","a","feather","light","low","budget","film","comedi","base","on","the","same","theme","which","provid","effortless","but","unreward","view","and","a","with","the","calendar","have","now","pass","beyond","it","erstwhil","period","much","of","the","comedi","be","lai","on","with","a","trowel","although","there","be","just","a","few","genuin","funni","moment","to","exercis","your","mind","in","the","long","interv","between","thi","you","can","focu","it","on","the","question","of","whether","thi","film","will","gain","a","new","extens","of","life","by","be","releas","a","a","dvd","or","whether","it","will","final","disappear","into","oblivion","a","exist","tape","copi","deterior","past","redempt","there","be","mani","wrong","film","appear","a","dvd","thi","dai","and","frankli","i","do","not","care","much","what","happen","either","waybr","br","so","far","the","well","of","the","film","of","thi","genr","have","probabl","be","the","handmaiden","tale","but","i","would","veri","happili","swap","them","all","for","a","good","make","film","of","jack","london","tower","novel","the","iron","heel","ambiti","a","thi","would","be","it","still","seem","incred","that","no","modern","film","maker","have","yet","dare","to","attempt","it","imdb","onli","list","a","bw","silent","version","make","in","russia","in"],"filtered":["life","futur","fascist","near","fascist","state","sever","restrict","person","freedom","recurr","theme","modern","literatur","film","maker","work","post","u","warn","undesir","trend","societi","watch","effect","thei","must","conjur","entertain","unfortun","much","book","probabl","much","effect","post","warn","entertain","u","enough","becom","realli","wide","read","whilst","film","problem","usual","wai","round","work","becom","realli","wide","know","probabl","georg","orwel","publish","thi","still","readili","avail","form","book","filmbr","br","watch","read","feel","littl","depress","man","inhuman","man","reach","cinderella","thi","feather","light","low","budget","film","comedi","base","theme","provid","effortless","unreward","view","calendar","pass","beyond","erstwhil","period","much","comedi","lai","trowel","although","genuin","funni","moment","exercis","mind","long","interv","thi","focu","question","whether","thi","film","gain","new","extens","life","releas","dvd","whether","final","disappear","oblivion","exist","tape","copi","deterior","past","redempt","mani","wrong","film","appear","dvd","thi","dai","frankli","care","much","happen","either","waybr","br","far","well","film","thi","genr","probabl","handmaiden","tale","veri","happili","swap","good","make","film","jack","london","tower","novel","iron","heel","ambiti","thi","still","seem","incred","modern","film","maker","yet","dare","attempt","imdb","onli","list","bw","silent","version","make","russia"],"filtered2":["life","futur","fascist","near","fascist","state","sever","restrict","person","freedom","recurr","theme","modern","literatur","maker","work","post","u","warn","undesir","trend","societi","watch","effect","must","conjur","entertain","unfortun","book","probabl","effect","post","warn","entertain","u","enough","becom","realli","wide","read","whilst","problem","usual","wai","round","work","becom","realli","wide","know","probabl","georg","orwel","publish","still","readili","avail","form","book","filmbr","watch","read","feel","littl","depress","man","inhuman","man","reach","cinderella","feather","light","low","budget","comedi","base","theme","provid","effortless","unreward","view","calendar","pass","beyond","erstwhil","period","comedi","lai","trowel","although","genuin","funni","moment","exercis","mind","long","interv","focu","question","whether","gain","new","extens","life","releas","dvd","whether","final","disappear","oblivion","exist","tape","copi","deterior","past","redempt","mani","wrong","appear","dvd","dai","frankli","care","happen","either","waybr","far","well","genr","probabl","handmaiden","tale","veri","happili","swap","good","make","jack","london",

{"value":"I don't know why, but for some sick reason, I think since I've been on the Disney sequel binge, I decided to just go ahead and see 102 Dalmations. The first movie that was a remake of the Disney cartoon classic starring Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, it seemed like a sure hit, but it was just a bomb. I think the reason why these movies don't work is because 101 Dalmations, the original, was a cartoon, it just worked better and was more appealing to the kids as well as adults. This was not really that fun because it's adults running around trying to act like cartoons instead of just actual human beings, I understand they're trying to make sure that it's appealing to the kids, but it's ridicules to see the way these actors are behaving in the film. And 102 Dalmations's story isn't really that good.<br /><br />Cruella De Vil has been in prison for a while, but things change when she is proved that she now loves animals and is a pleasant human being. But her reputation is now damaged as a puppy-napper, but she buys a man's dog shelter and is all of a sudden is being loved by everyone and it looks like she's changed. But when she sees her probation officer's Dalmatians, she goes crazy and starts seeing spots, and she looses it. She's back for revenge on puppies and is still determined to get that Dalmation coat she's always wanted.<br /><br />Glenn Close is such an amazing actress, very under rated, but her taking on Cruella De Vil, she's good, but let's face it, this movie made the fun villain just more of a silly nut case. Also, as cute as the puppies were, it just works more for the animation, it sounds stupid, but it's just not as believable without the cartoon and their personalities being in the mix. I wouldn't really recommend 102 Dalmations, it's alright, but if you agree that the first movie was just a waste of time, this is just the same thing.<br /><br

{"value":"I really wanted to like this film, but so much of it is stolen/borrowed from other work -- some of the borrowing is painfully blatant. The New York Times' review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous Warner Brothers' cartoon ('Hello my baby, hello my darlin', hello my ragtime gal...'). But I challenge anyone to watch the Fox/Blue Sky animated feature Robots (2005) and not find ridiculous similarities in: storyline - A young inventor growing up, and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventions.<br /><br />cityscape - Extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environments.<br /><br />...robots... - The servant robot in the Robinson household has a very similar design to those in Robots, and both films use a sort of retro-futuristic look.<br /><br />All of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the obnoxious quote from Disney at the end, implying that the company has been a steady innovator who never looks back (which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were pretty much clones of each other, with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicity).<br /><br />The filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own, and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction, as though we don't have the attention span for anything less.<br /><br />The villain is really well-designed and brilliantly animated, and he's a pleasure to watch. Much of the rest of the film seems thrown-together. Some of the landscapes look like CGI from the mid-90s.<br /><br />The film actually opens with a classic Mickey Mouse short. By the end of this cartoon, we are reminded that Disney never did have much interest in innovating or good storytelling -- they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue.","finished_norm":["i","realli","want","to","like","thi","film","but","so","much","of","it","be","stolenborrow","from","other","work","some","of","the","borrow","be","painfulli","blatant","the","new","york","time","review","point","out","that","their","sing","frog","be","awfulli","reminisc","of","the","on","in","the","famou","warner","brother","cartoon","hello","my","babi","hello","my","darlin","hello","my","ragtim","gal","but","i","challeng","anyon","to","watch","the","foxblu","sky","anim","featur","robot","and","not","find","ridicul","similar","in","storylin","a","young","inventor","grow","up","and","a","singl","innov","corpor","distribut","all","great","inventionsbr","br","cityscap","extrem","similar","camera","angl","captur","extrem","similar","futurist","citi","environmentsbr","br","robot","the","servant","robot","in","the","robinson","household","have","a","veri","similar","design","to","that","in","robot","and","both","film","us","a","sort","of","retrofuturist","lookbr","br","all","of","thi","seem","to","be","in","sharp","contradict","to","the","obnoxi","quot","from","disnei","at","the","end","impli","that","the","compani","have","be","a","steadi","innov","who","never","look","back","which","conjur","contradict","their","entir","catalog","of","film","in","the","that","be","pretti","much","clone","of","each","other","with","some","minor","tweak","to","storylin","and","ethnicitybr","br","the","filmmak","seem","unabl","to","let","the","stori","speak","on","it","own","and","instead","constantli","send","object","and","nois","fly","in","our","direct","a","though","we","do","not","have","the","attent","spin","for","anyth","lessbr","br","the","villain","be","realli","welldesign","and","brilliantli","anim","and","he","a","pleasur","to","watch","much","of","the","rest","of","the","film","seem","throwntogeth","some","of","the","landscap","look","like","cgi","from","the","midsbr","br","the","film","actual","open","with","a","classic","mickei","mous","short","by","the","end","of","thi","cartoon","we","be","remind","that","disnei","never","do","have","much","interest","in","innov","or","good","storytel","thei","seem","to","think","that","simpli","get","someth","up","on","the","big","screen","be","proof","enough","of","their","virtu"],"filtered":["realli","want","like","thi","film","much","stolenborrow","work","borrow","painfulli","blatant","new","york","time","review","point","sing","frog","awfulli","reminisc","famou","warner","brother","cartoon","hello","babi","hello","darlin","hello","ragtim","gal","challeng","anyon","watch","foxblu","sky","anim","featur","robot","find","ridicul","similar","storylin","young","inventor","grow","singl","innov","corpor","distribut","great","inventionsbr","br","cityscap","extrem","similar","camera","angl","captur","extrem","similar","futurist","citi","environmentsbr","br","robot","servant","robot","robinson","household","veri","similar","design","robot","film","us","sort","retrofuturist","lookbr","br","thi","seem","sharp","contradict","obnoxi","quot","disnei","end","impli","compani","steadi","innov","never","look","back","conjur","contradict","entir","catalog","film","pretti","much","clone","minor","tweak","storylin","ethnicitybr","br","filmmak","seem","unabl","let","stori","speak","instead","constantli","send","object","nois","fly","direct","though","attent","spin","anyth","lessbr","br","villain","realli","welldesign","brilliantli","anim","pleasur","watch","much","rest","film","seem","throwntogeth","landscap","look","like","cgi","midsbr","br","film","actual","open","classic","mickei","mous","short","end","thi","cartoon","remind","disnei","never","much","interest","innov","good","storytel","thei","seem","think","simpli","get","someth","big","screen","proof","enough","virtu"],"filtered2":["realli","want","like","stolenborrow","work","borrow","painfulli","blatant","new","york","time","review","point","sing","frog","awfulli","reminisc","famou","warner","brother","cartoon","hello","babi","hello","darlin","hello","ragtim","gal","challeng","anyon","watch","foxblu","sky","anim","featur","robot","find","ridicul","similar","storylin","young","inventor","grow","singl","innov","corpor","distribut","great","inventionsbr","cityscap","extrem","similar","camera","angl","captur","extrem","similar","futurist","citi","environmentsbr","robot","servant","robot","robinson","household","veri","similar","design","robot","us","sort","retrofuturist","lookbr","seem","sharp","contradict","obnoxi","quot","disnei","end","impli","compani","steadi","innov","never","look","back","conjur","contradict","entir","catalog","pretti","clone","minor","tweak","storylin","ethnicitybr","filmmak","seem","unabl","let","stori","speak","instead","constantli","send","object","nois","fly","direct","though","attent","spin","anyth","lessbr","villain","realli","welldesign","brilliantli","anim","pleasur","watch","rest","seem","throwntogeth","landscap","look","like","cgi","midsbr","actual","open","classic","mickei","mous","shor

{"value":"An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly assaulted by a group of two-dimensional psycho thugs during a night-time encounter on a forest road in Shropshire, England. The man and woman who were assaulted plan and carry out a revenge attack on their attackers...<br /><br />Utterly repellent piece of voyeuristic trash, somehow masquerading as 'thought-provoking' drama, whilst actually coming across as sub-Michael Winner cr*p (you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been cast had it so easily have been made in the 1970s). What happens to Alice (Gillian Anderson) and Adam (Danny Dyer) is appalling and devastating, yet Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the viewer's nose in every last glob of its sexual nastiness. His camera lingers hungrily on Anderson's naked body both during and after the assault, whilst the script leaves almost all the characters floundering in a turgid sea of two dimensional cliché. His script forces his characters to behave in such a way as to alienate the viewer further from the 'victims' by shoving more ghastly situations into their faces (Adams's attempted post-incident assaults on both Sophie and Alice; Alice's assault on Heffer AFTER his suicide-attempt confession).<br /><br />The quandary comes from the central protagonists' performances - Dyer is a horrible actor, incapable of light and shade as the young male victim of the initial assault (he'll end up in Eastenders, mark my words), but Anderson is extraordinary. Even as the atrocious script forces her character to behave in depraved and ludicrous ways, she somehow delivers an extraordinarily compelling and complicated characterisation as a self-indulgent, arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and needs to retaliate.<br /><br />A vile and pointless film then, almost but not quite rescued by a compelling central female performance.","finished_norm":["a","unpleas","woman","and","a","equal","unpleas","man","be","violent","and","horribli","assault","by","a","group","of","twodimension","psycho","thug","dure","a","nighttim","encount","on","a","forest","road","in","shropshir","england","the","man","and","woman","who","be","assault","plan","and","carri","out","a","reveng","attack","on","their","attackersbr","br","utterli","repel","piec","of","voyeurist","trash","somehow","masquerad","a","thoughtprovok","drama","whilst","actual","come","across","a","submichael","winner","crp","you","just","know","that","oliv","re","and","susan","georg","would","have","be","cast","have","it","so","easili","have","be","make","in","the","what","happen","to","alic","gillian","anderson","and","adam","danni","dyer","be","appal","and","devast","yet","dan","re","somehow","manag","to","rub","the","viewer","nose","in","everi","last","glob","of","it","sexual","nasti","hi","camera","linger","hungrili","on","anderson","nake","bodi","both","dure","and","after","the","assault","whilst","the","script","leav","almost","all","the","charact","flounder","in","a","turgid","sea","of","two","dimension","cliché","hi","script","forc","hi","charact","to","behav","in","such","a","wai","a","to","alien","the","viewer","far","from","the","victim","by","shove","much","ghastli","situat","into","their","face","adam","attempt","postincid","assault","on","both","sophi","and","alic","alic","assault","on","heffer","after","hi","suicideattempt","confessionbr","br","the","quandari","come","from","the","central","protagonist","perform","dyer","be","a","horribl","actor","incap","of","light","and","shade","a","the","young","male","victim","of","the","initi","assault","he","will","end","up","in","eastend","mark","my","word","but","anderson","be","extraordinari","even","a","the","atroci","script","forc","her","charact","to","behav","in","deprav","and","ludicr","wai","she","somehow","deliv","a","extraordinarili","compel","and","complic","characteris","a","a","selfindulg","arrog","hedonist","who","encount","such","horror","and","ne","to","retaliatebr","br","a","vile","and","pointless","film","then","almost","but","not","quit","rescu","by","a","compel","central","femal","perform"],"filtered":["unpleas","woman","equal","unpleas","man","violent","horribli","assault","group","twodimension","psycho","thug","dure","nighttim","encount","forest","road","shropshir","england","man","woman","assault","plan","carri","reveng","attack","attackersbr","br","utterli","repel","piec","voyeurist","trash","somehow","masquerad","thoughtprovok","drama","whilst","actual","come","across","submichael","winner","crp","know","oliv","re","susan","georg","cast","easili","make","happen","alic","gillian","anderson","adam","danni","dyer","appal","devast","yet","dan","re","somehow","manag","rub","viewer","nose","everi","last","glob","sexual","nasti","hi","camera","linger","hungrili","anderson","nake","bodi","dure","assault","whilst","script","leav","almost","charact","flounder","turgid","sea","two","dimension","cliché","hi","script","forc","hi","charact","behav","wai","alien","viewer","far","victim","shove","much","ghastli","situat","face","adam","attempt","postincid","assault","sophi","alic","alic","assault","heffer","hi","suicideattempt","confessionbr","br","quandari","come","central","protagonist","perform","dyer","horribl","actor","incap","light","shade","young","male","victim","initi","assault","end","eastend","mark","word","anderson","extraordinari","even","atroci","script","forc","charact","behav","deprav","ludicr","wai","somehow","deliv","extraordinarili","compel","complic","characteris","selfindulg","arrog","hedonist","encount","horror","ne","retaliatebr","br","vile","pointless","film","almost","quit","rescu","compel","central","femal","perform"],"filtered2":["unpleas","woman","equal","unpleas","man","violent","horribli","assault","group","twodimension","psycho","thug","dure","nighttim","encount","forest","road","shropshir","england","man","woman","assault","plan","carri","reveng","attack","attackersbr","utterli","repel","piec","voyeurist","trash","somehow","masquerad","thoughtprovok","drama","whilst","actual","come","across","submichael","winner","crp","know","oliv","re","susan","georg","cast","easili","make","happen","alic","gillian","anderson","adam","danni","dyer","appal","devast","yet","dan","re","somehow","manag","rub","viewer","nose","everi","last","glob","sexual","nasti","camera","linger","hungrili","anderson","nake","bodi","dure","assault","whilst","script","leav","almost","charact","flounder","turgid","sea","two","dimension","cliché","script","forc","charact","behav","wai","alien","viewer","far","victim","shove","ghastli","situat","face","adam","attempt","postincid","assault","sophi","alic","alic","assault","heffer","suicideattempt","confessionbr","quandari","come","central","protagonist","perform","dyer","horribl","actor","incap","light","shade","young","male","victim","initi","assault","end","eastend","m

{"value":"My roommate got the No, No, Nanette soundtrack as a dub on a tape and she proceeded to listen to it non-stop. After it finally totally brainwashed me into submission, I found the songs to be irresistible, especially the famous, I want to be happy, but I can't be happy... But of coarse from the soundtrack I had no idea what the film was about. So the other day I saw a copy of it at the video store and I rented what was supposed to be a long lost version of the film. I was thinking that it was going to be amazing, because the soundtrack is so cute. Unfortunately most of the songs that I loved were nowhere to be found in the video I saw. Now I've never seen the 1930 version of the musical but this version was sadly disappointing because there was very little singing and practically no dancing and beside that the sound was really bad through out and you couldn't really understand what people were saying a lot of the time. Really the only highlights of this film were the outrageous 1940's fashion. Nanette wears this crazy hat with two feathers that stick out like rabbit ears and Kansas Kitty has this bizarre feather muff that she keeps on her fore arm and then has herself wrapped in this net scarf. The one dance sequence is a little weird too with Nanette doing this weird ballet stuff with pin-up girl imagery superimposed on top of her. Actually one more bright spot of the film was the artist Guillespe who dreams of being a fine artist but it currently condemned to drawing pin-up girls for money. I like how Guillespe keeps it old school, and disses Nanette when his masterpiece, the piece that was to make his career, is sold by Nanette for a paltry $5250.

{"value":"I only today, picked this up at the 99 cents only store today, and I still think I got ripped off. \"Dream to Believe\" is a pretty boring and unrealistic gymnastics drama and $1 is just too freakin' expensive for this. This film is probably only notable for 2 things: 1. It has a young Keanu Reeves. And 2. It's directed by Paul Lynch, the man who also did Promo Night. Now onto the movie. <br /><br />It's about a girl named Robin (Played by Olivia D'Abo) who is badly injured from a car accident that also cost her father's life. So the accident prevents her from competing in gymnastic tournaments, she is often picked on during her classes and eventually she meets some wild kid named Tommy (Played by Keanu.) Robin, when not in training, works part-time, along with her mother and stepsister, at a Laundromat owned by her abusive stepfather. Eventually she is chosen to compete. <br /><br />Overall, Keanu alone and some catchy 80s tunes are what prevent me from giving this 1 star, and it's also not one of the worst movies ever, but still far from good. The DVD itself is not getting any medals either as it appears to be sourced from an old VHS and towards the end, the sound goes out of sync and when the end credits are almost over, it fades to black, even though sound can still be heard. So this can probably be passed as a bootleg. The DVD artwork makes no sense either as it has what appears to be recent photos of Keanu and Olivia and the background has nothing to do with the movie, as it's also not in the movie itself, so the cover's obviously photoshopped. In any case, avoid at all costs, unless you're a Keanu fanatic. I probably won't be hanging to it any longer. I'm probably gonna give it to The Cinema Snob, who's a great YT critic btw. Hey, if any of you have any crappy movies that they no longer want in their sight, feel free to donate to him to keep his show running.","finished_norm":["i","onli","todai","pick","thi","up","at","the","cent","onli","store","todai","and","i","still","think","i","get","rip","off","dream","to","believ","be","a","pretti","bore","and","unrealist","gymnast","drama","and","be","just","too","freakin","expens","for","thi","thi","film","be","probabl","onli","notabl","for","thing","it","have","a","young","keanu","reev","and","it","direct","by","paul","lynch","the","man","who","conjur","do","promo","night","now","onto","the","movi","br","br","it","about","a","girl","name","robin","plai","by","olivia","have","abo","who","be","badli","injur","from","a","car","accid","that","conjur","cost","her","father","life","so","the","accid","prevent","her","from","compet","in","gymnast","tournam","she","be","often","pick","on","dure","her","class","and","eventu","she","meet","some","wild","kid","name","tommi","plai","by","keanu","robin","when","not","in","train","work","parttim","along","with","her","mother","and","stepsist","at","a","laundromat","own","by","her","abus","stepfath","eventu","she","be","choos","to","compet","br","br","overal","keanu","alon","and","some","catchi","tune","be","what","prevent","me","from","give","thi","star","and","it","conjur","not","on","of","the","wrong","movi","ever","but","still","far","from","good","the","dvd","itself","be","not","get","ani","medal","either","a","it","appear","to","be","sourc","from","a","old","vh","and","toward","the","end","the","sound","go","out","of","sync","and","when","the","end","credit","be","almost","over","it","fade","to","black","even","though","sound","can","still","be","hear","so","thi","can","probabl","be","pass","a","a","bootleg","the","dvd","artwork","make","no","sens","either","a","it","have","what","appear","to","be","recent","photo","of","keanu","and","olivia","and","the","background","have","noth","to","do","with","the","movi","a","it","conjur","not","in","the","movi","itself","so","the","cover","obvious","photoshop","in","ani","case","avoid","at","all","cost","unless","you","re","a","keanu","fanat","i","probabl","wo","not","be","hang","to","it","ani","long","i","be","probabl","gonna","give","it","to","the","cinema","snob","who","a","great","yt","critic","btw","hei","if","ani","of","you","have","ani","crappi","movi","that","thei","no","long","want","in","their","sight","feel","free","to","donat","to","him","to","keep","hi","show","run"],"filtered":["onli","todai","pick","thi","cent","onli","store","todai","still","think","get","rip","dream","believ","pretti","bore","unrealist","gymnast","drama","freakin","expens","thi","thi","film","probabl","onli","notabl","thing","young","keanu","reev","direct","paul","lynch","man","conjur","promo","night","onto","movi","br","br","girl","name","robin","plai","olivia","abo","badli","injur","car","accid","conjur","cost","father","life","accid","prevent","compet","gymnast","tournam","often","pick","dure","class","eventu","meet","wild","kid","name","tommi","plai","keanu","robin","train","work","parttim","along","mother","stepsist","laundromat","abus","stepfath","eventu","choos","compet","br","br","overal","keanu","alon","catchi","tune","prevent","give","thi","star","conjur","wrong","movi","ever","still","far","good","dvd","get","ani","medal","either","appear","sourc","old","vh","toward","end","sound","go","sync","end","credit","almost","fade","black","even","though","sound","still","hear","thi","probabl","pass","bootleg","dvd","artwork","make","sens","either","appear","recent","photo","keanu","olivia","background","noth","movi","conjur","movi","cover","obvious","photoshop","ani","case","avoid","cost","unless","re","keanu","fanat","probabl","wo","hang","ani","long","probabl","gonna","give","cinema","snob","great","yt","critic","btw","hei","ani","ani","crappi","movi","thei","long","want","sight","feel","free","donat","keep","hi","show","run"],"filtered2":["onli","todai","pick","cent","onli","store","todai","still","think","get","rip","dream","believ","pretti","bore","unrealist","gymnast","drama","freakin","expens","probabl","onli","notabl","thing","young","keanu","reev","direct","paul","lynch","man","conjur","promo","night","onto","girl","name","robin","plai","olivia","abo","badli","injur","car","accid","conjur","cost","father","life","accid","prevent","compet","gymnast","tournam","often","pick","dure","class","eventu","meet","wild","kid","name","tommi","plai","keanu","robin","train","work","parttim","along","mother","stepsist","laundromat","abus","stepfath","eventu","choos","compet","overal","keanu","alon","catchi","tune","prevent","give","star","conjur","wrong","ever","still","far","good","dvd","get","ani","medal","either","appear","sourc","old","vh","toward","end","sound","go","sync","end","credit","almost","fade","black","even","though","sound","still","hear","probabl","pass","bootleg","dvd","artwork","make","sens","either","appear","recent","photo","keanu","olivia","background","noth","conjur","cover","obvious","photoshop","ani","case","avoid","cost",

{"value":"Lillian Hellman's play, adapted by Dashiell Hammett with help from Hellman, becomes a curious project to come out of gritty Warner Bros. Paul Lukas, reprising his Broadway role and winning the Best Actor Oscar, plays an anti-Nazi German underground leader fighting the Fascists, dragging his American wife and three children all over Europe before finding refuge in the States (via the Mexico border). They settle in Washington with the wife's wealthy mother and brother, though a boarder residing in the manor is immediately suspicious of the newcomers and spends an awful lot of time down at the German Embassy playing poker. It seems to take forever for this drama to find its focus, and when we realize what the heart of the material is (the wise, honest, direct refugees teaching the clueless, head-in-the-sand Americans how the world has suddenly changed), it seems a little patronizing--the viewer is quite literally put in the relatives' place, being lectured to. Lukas has several speeches in the third-act which undoubtedly won him the Academy Award, yet for the much of the picture he seems to do little but enter and exit, enter and exit. As his spouse, Bette Davis enunciates like nobody else and works her wide eyes to good advantage, but the role doesn't allow her much color. Their children (all with divergent accents!) are alternately humorous and annoying, and Geraldine Fitzgerald has a nothing role as a put-upon wife (and the disgruntled texture she brings to the part seems entirely wrong). The intent here was to tastefully, tactfully show us just because a (WWII-era) man may be German, that doesn't make him a Nazi sympathizer. We get that in the first few minutes; the rest of this tasteful, tactful movie is made up of exposition, defensive confrontation and, ultimately, compassion. It should be a heady mix, but instead it's rather dry-eyed and inert. ** from

{"value":"I think I should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts. The true test is whether it is good from start to finish, which is the reason I gave the analogical title for this review. Most of us would agree--even those like me, who enjoy reading many blogs--that blogs can't compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons. Likewise, FEM can't compare with good film making for a number of reasons, and I actually believe it's a poor example of independent filmography. From start to finish, FEM feels like a pieced together vlog. (Heck, even MySpace gets some pimping.) If I wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15--I don't--I'd go watch it. FEM, while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media, is so personal that it is without an interesting story. It's like watching the mundaneness of life, which I think most would agree is very naturally boring. And yet the creators of FEM want us to applaud it, their very postmodern film about making a film. Cue my yawn.<br /><br />Ultimately, I come away not caring the least bit about any of it. I'm shocked that I'm actually interested in taking time out to write this review, even. It's not that FEM is downright bad, because it isn't; it has a few moments where I crack a smile or think that maybe--just maybe--something of interest is about to happen. It's rather that it's just downright...mediocre. I feel so indifferent about it that it's almost fitting of an oxymoron: passionate indifference.<br /><br />I hope the creators/\"actors\" in the film get out of debt from their efforts. They'll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life.<br /><br />See this movie if you've got time to waste and nothing much you want to do; otherwise, pass it by, and don't worry that you've missed some great, undiscovered talent.

{"value":"***One Out of Ten Stars*** <br /><br />Because if it was, it gets an F. Holy Mother Mary of God was this bad. I mean, I gave it every reasonable accommodation considering it was a straight to video film, but it let me down at every turn. Like so many other B movies, the basic storyline was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous. It's a shame they attached the good name of Halloween to this fiasco.<br /><br />The basic premise surrounds some frat douche bags hosting their annual Halloween haunted house fund raiser, when a satanic spell book shows up out of nowhere and hurls the frat boys into a living hell. Well that's the idea anyway, but instead most of the film is devoted to displaying these frat boy's relationship escapades, abound with an outrageous lesbian subplot. Very little of the actual story is devoted to Halloween or the mysterious spell book. It actually makes me mad that the film makers thought they could get away with making such dribble. <br /><br />The film is essentially about frat boy relationships. This IS NOT what the movie is billed as. I'm tempted to track down the producers and at the very least threaten them with bodily harm. The acting is about as bad as it gets, it's atrocious! The script is unintentionally funny. The cinematography is just plain lazy. The whole film is amateur night. This movie actually makes the SyFy channel movie productions look like masterpieces.<br /><br />The last half hour of the film felt like the film makers realized they weren't producing a soap opera and had to throw in some sort of horror sequences. The evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone in the haunted house into the character their dressed up as. I almost feel like crying as I write this review. Wow! I mean wow! This thing was an undecipherable chopped up

{"value":"Five years after the original Creepshow, another inferior horror sequel is penned by George A. Romero and Stephen King: Creepshow 2. This time there are only three stories instead of five. None of the three stories is really original or distinguished either. The first story is a horror staple, formulaic story about a wooden Indian statue seeking revenge against the killers of its owners. The effects are really neat in this story, but it's just too familiar to be compelling enough. George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour play the elderly store owners. The second story, \"The Raft\", is a Stephen King story. It's about four teenagers that unwittingly spend the day on a wooden pallet in the middle of an isolated lake. Soon the kids are screaming for their lives as a watery blob does each of them in for no apparent reason. However, instead of being suspenseful, the kids are saddled with bad dialog and dopey-headed behavior, preventing us from really caring about what happens next. There is also some unintentional humor in this segment. The third and final story is \"The Hitch-hiker\", which is actually a retread re-adapted for Creepshow 2. The original story, by Lucille Fletcher, was filmed in 1953 as a film noir suspense film. Then it was adapted for a famous Twilight Zone episode featuring Inger Stevens. \"The Hitch-hiker\" works the best out of these three offerings, but it's not without its problems either. Lois Chiles plays a cheating spouse, who ends up running over a hitch-hiker, or so she thinks. However, we don't know whether to sympathize with her or condemn her. As in many average stories of this type, the characters exist merely to tell the stories with their twists and turns. The wrap around story with the bullies seems a bit out of place. Tom Savini appears as the \"creep\" in this installment. The good thing is there haven't been any more sequels. *1/2 of 4

{"value":"I watched DVD 1 only. The program proper may have 10 minutes of good information; otherwise it's snotty putdowns of religious people. It's as if director Brian Flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and feels with these tools he can easily bludgeon his opposition.<br /><br />Also, Flemming wanders extensively into his own personal issues, and they take over the movie. It never gets back on topic.<br /><br />Religious people are prone to discount skeptics when their objections to religion are obviously rooted in abusive upbringings. Arguments from such victimized people seem irrational, and therefore unconvincing.<br /><br />Anti-religious people will want more data. We don't need to be told that religious people are nutty, any more than American Jews need to be told how annoying Christmas music gets by mid-December.<br /><br />In the best scene, the Superintendent of Fleming's childhood Christian school rather insightfully confronts the director on his motivations. That seems like the most honest part of the movie, and it was too short.<br /><br />If Fleming were a bit more self-aware, he might have a good story in him about his own (past & current) relationship to Christianity, and the abusive institutions that indoctrinated him in his youth.<br /><br />And perhaps he could lend his \"Christ never walked the earth\" material to a more serious documentarian. I'm not studying the writings of Saul/Paul to find out how air-tight this all is, but a quick browse of Wikipedia suggests most of these arguments are discredited.<br /><br />The bonus interviews are pretty good, tho they don't bolster Fleming's thesis much. Sam Harris is a good spokesperson for the anti-religious POV, and he doesn't go light on those other, non-Christian religions. Harris also has some good (and easily Google'd) interviews on Salon.com , Amazon.com , and Samharris.org

{"value":"Let me start out by saying I can enjoy just about any bad Italian horror movie or jungle exploitation flick from the 1970's. Seriously. This one was downright awful.<br /><br />There are way too many elements that Martino tries to inject and none of them work (except for the croc-gone-wild thing) very well at all. There are some ignorant Westerners, of course, who set up a resort in the jungle somewhere. I don't even remember where it takes place...how sad is that... Basically, people come to the resort to see this native tribe and its' ceremonies but eventually they upset the 'Alligator God' of the river who then proceeds to go on a rampage, killing said vacationers and some tribesmen as well. Sounds good, yeah? Well, don't get your hopes up. There is minimal violence until the end, the special effects are so bad it was like a kindergarten class performed them and the love story thrown in is laughable.<br /><br />There is seriously a few scenes where it appears they set up a camera underwater in a pool and threw a toy alligator, like a dart, into the water and that is supposed to be the gator attacking. I'm not kidding. In another wonderfully crafted special effect, a Matchbox van is targeted by the incredible sinking plastic gator, who all of a sudden is five times the size of a van. (A few minutes ago, he was only big enough to eat a human, but now he dwarfs a full-size cargo van...) It is really pathetic. The only other flick I can think of where the effects were so bad I was pulled out of the story was Bruno Mattei's masterpiece, \"Rats,\" what with the plastic rats on the conveyor belt and all who COULDN'T be terrified.<br /><br />Normally I'd say anything Sergio Martino was a solid must-see but this one is a must-pass.

{"value":"Not really spoilers in my opinion, but I wanted to cover myself, nevertheless. As the executive producer, Morgan Freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 Items Or Less, a movie with an intentional indie-feel, and just be absorbed in the mentor/be-all-that-you-can-be theme. He plays a alternate universe, semi-washed up version of the real Morgan Freeman, who is chauffeured in an old Econovan by a kid all the way into Carson, CA from Brentwood to research his next movie role. Why Carson, is a mystery to So. Cal residents. He could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the San Fernando Valley and found the same elements. Paz Vega is pretty to watch, a cross between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz, playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for Moragn Freeman's research. His character is only known as \"Him\" to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people-\"Psst, that's 'him,' etc. Unfortunately, I was too distracted that Him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in Brentwood, carried no cash or debit card, or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him. If one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like Him does, then I gotta see cash and a Blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which Him definitely has. Nothing really happens in this movie. I don't believe that either of the main character's were substantially changed by their encounter with each other. It flirts with the idea of adultery, but then that thought fizzles. This to me was similar to Steve Martin's Shopgirl, without the sexual affair. It was self-indulgent for Freeman and unconvincing to the audience.","finished_norm":["not","realli","spoiler","in","my","opinion","but","i","want","to","cover","myself","nevertheless","a","the","execut","produc","morgan","freeman","want","the","audienc","to","ignor","the","numer","absurd","of","hi","charact","in","item","or","littl","a","movi","with","a","intent","indiefeel","and","just","be","absorb","in","the","mentorbeallthatyoucanb","theme","he","plai","a","altern","univers","semiwash","up","version","of","the","real","morgan","freeman","who","be","chauffeur","in","a","old","econovan","by","a","kid","all","the","wai","into","carson","ca","from","brentwood","to","research","hi","next","movi","role","why","carson","be","a","mysteri","to","so","cal","resid","he","can","have","save","the","trip","and","go","anywher","in","the","san","fernando","vallei","and","find","the","same","elem","paz","vega","be","pretti","to","watch","a","cross","between","salma","hayek","and","penelop","cruz","plai","a","disgruntl","groceri","checker","at","a","larg","but","slow","local","market","that","appar","be","the","ultim","sourc","for","moragn","freeman","research","hi","charact","be","onli","know","a","him","to","allud","to","how","actor","be","regard","when","encount","in","real","life","by","averag","peoplepsst","that","him","etc","unfortun","i","be","too","distract","that","him","have","all","kind","of","worldli","wisdom","and","advic","but","have","no","reliabl","return","back","to","hi","home","in","brentwood","carri","no","cash","or","debit","card","or","have","the","wisdom","to","keep","a","cell","phone","with","him","if","on","have","such","a","high","opinion","of","their","self","that","thei","believ","thei","possess","a","answer","to","everyth","like","him","doe","then","i","gotta","see","cash","and","a","blackberri","which","displai","intellig","and","good","surviv","instinct","to","preserv","that","big","ego","which","him","definit","have","noth","realli","happen","in","thi","movi","i","do","not","believ","that","either","of","the","main","charact","be","substanti","chang","by","their","encount","with","each","other","it","flirt","with","the","idea","of","adulteri","but","then","that","think","fizzl","thi","to","me","be","similar","to","steve","martin","shopgirl","without","the","sexual","affair","it","be","selfindulg","for","freeman","and","unconvinc","to","the","audienc"],"filtered":["realli","spoiler","opinion","want","cover","nevertheless","execut","produc","morgan","freeman","want","audienc","ignor","numer","absurd","hi","charact","item","littl","movi","intent","indiefeel","absorb","mentorbeallthatyoucanb","theme","plai","altern","univers","semiwash","version","real","morgan","freeman","chauffeur","old","econovan","kid","wai","carson","ca","brentwood","research","hi","next","movi","role","carson","mysteri","cal","resid","save","trip","go","anywher","san","fernando","vallei","find","elem","paz","vega","pretti","watch","cross","salma","hayek","penelop","cruz","plai","disgruntl","groceri","checker","larg","slow","local","market","appar","ultim","sourc","moragn","freeman","research","hi","charact","onli","know","allud","actor","regard","encount","real","life","averag","peoplepsst","etc","unfortun","distract","kind","worldli","wisdom","advic","reliabl","return","back","hi","home","brentwood","carri","cash","debit","card","wisdom","keep","cell","phone","high","opinion","self","thei","believ","thei","possess","answer","everyth","like","doe","gotta","see","cash","blackberri","displai","intellig","good","surviv","instinct","preserv","big","ego","definit","noth","realli","happen","thi","movi","believ","either","main","charact","substanti","chang","encount","flirt","idea","adulteri","think","fizzl","thi","similar","steve","martin","shopgirl","without","sexual","affair","selfindulg","freeman","unconvinc","audienc"],"filtered2":["realli","spoiler","opinion","want","cover","nevertheless","execut","produc","morgan","freeman","want","audienc","ignor","numer","absurd","charact","item","littl","intent","indiefeel","absorb","mentorbeallthatyoucanb","theme","plai","altern","univers","semiwash","version","real","morgan","freeman","chauffeur","old","econovan","kid","wai","carson","ca","brentwood","research","next","role","carson","mysteri","cal","resid","save","trip","go","anywher","san","fernando","vallei","find","elem","paz","vega","pretti","watch","cross","salma","hayek","penelop","cruz","plai","disgruntl","groceri","checker","larg","slow","local","market","appar","ultim","sourc","moragn","freeman","research","charact","onli","know","allud","actor","regard","encount","real","life","averag","peoplepsst","etc","unfortun","distract","kind","worldli","wisdom","advic","reliabl","return","back","home","brentwood","carri","cash","debit","card","wisdom","keep","cell","phone","high","opinion","self","believ","possess","answer","everyth","like","doe","gotta","see","cash","blackberri","displai","intellig","good","surviv","instinct","preserv","big","ego","definit","noth","realli","happen","bel

{"value":"En route to a small town that lays way off the beaten track (but which looks suspiciously close to a freeway), a female reporter runs into a strange hitch-hiker who agrees to help direct her to her destination. The strange man then recounts a pair of gruesome tales connected to the area: in the first story, an adulterous couple plot to kill the woman's husband, but eventually suffer a far worse fate themselves when they are attacked by a zombie; and in the second story, a group of campers have their vacation cut short when an undead outlaw takes umbrage at having his grave peed on.<br /><br />The Zombie Chronicles is an attempt by writer Garrett Clancy and director Brad Sykes at making a zombie themed anthologya nice idea, but with only two stories, it falls woefully short. And that's not the only way in which this low budget gore flick fails to deliver: the acting is lousy (with Joe Haggerty, as the tale-telling Ebenezer Jackson, giving one of the strangest performances I have ever seen); the locations are uninspired; the script is dreary; there's a sex scene with zero nudity; and the ending.... well, that beggars belief.<br /><br />To be fair, some of Sykes' creative camera-work is effective (although the gimmicky technique employed as characters run through the woods is a tad overused) and Joe Castro's cheapo gore is enthusiastic: an ear is bitten off, eyeballs are plucked out, a face is removed, brains are squished, and there is a messy decapitation. These positives just about make the film bearable, but be warned, The Zombie Chronicles ain't a stroll in the park, even for seasoned viewers of z-grade trash.<br /><br />I give The Zombie Chronicles 2/10, but generously raise my rating to 3 since I didn't get to view the film with the benefit of 3D (although I have a sneaking suspicion that an extra dimension wouldn't have made that much of a difference).","finished_norm":["en","rout","to","a","small","town","that","lai","wai","off","the","beat","track","but","which","look","suspici","close","to","a","freewai","a","femal","report","run","into","a","strang","hitchhik","who","agre","to","help","direct","her","to","her","destin","the","strang","man","then","recount","a","pair","of","gruesom","tale","connect","to","the","area","in","the","stori","a","adulter","coupl","plot","to","kill","the","woman","husband","but","eventu","suffer","a","far","wrong","fate","themselv","when","thei","be","attack","by","a","zombi","and","in","the","stori","a","group","of","camper","have","their","vacat","cut","short","when","a","undead","outlaw","take","umbrag","at","have","hi","grave","pee","onbr","br","the","zombi","chronicl","be","a","attempt","by","writer","garrett","clanci","and","director","brad","syk","at","make","a","zombi","theme","anthologya","nice","idea","but","with","onli","two","stori","it","fall","woefulli","short","and","that","not","the","onli","wai","in","which","thi","low","budget","gore","flick","fail","to","deliv","the","act","be","lousi","with","joe","haggerti","a","the","taletel","ebenez","jackson","give","on","of","the","strang","perform","i","have","ever","see","the","locat","be","uninspir","the","script","be","dreari","there","a","sex","scene","with","zero","nuditi","and","the","end","good","that","beggar","beliefbr","br","to","be","fair","some","of","syk","creativ","camerawork","be","effect","although","the","gimmicki","techniqu","emploi","a","charact","run","through","the","wood","be","a","tad","overus","and","joe","castro","cheapo","gore","be","enthusiast","a","ear","be","bite","off","eyebal","be","pluck","out","a","face","be","remov","brain","be","squish","and","there","be","a","messi","decapit","thi","posit","just","about","make","the","film","bearabl","but","be","warn","the","zombi","chronicl","have","not","a","stroll","in","the","park","even","for","season","viewer","of","zgrade","trashbr","br","i","give","the","zombi","chronicl","but","gener","rais","my","rate","to","sinc","i","do","not","get","to","view","the","film","with","the","benefit","of","have","although","i","have","a","sneak","suspicion","that","a","extra","dimens","would","not","have","make","that","much","of","a","differ"],"filtered":["en","rout","small","town","lai","wai","beat","track","look","suspici","close","freewai","femal","report","run","strang","hitchhik","agre","help","direct","destin","strang","man","recount","pair","gruesom","tale","connect","area","stori","adulter","coupl","plot","kill","woman","husband","eventu","suffer","far","wrong","fate","themselv","thei","attack","zombi","stori","group","camper","vacat","cut","short","undead","outlaw","take","umbrag","hi","grave","pee","onbr","br","zombi","chronicl","attempt","writer","garrett","clanci","director","brad","syk","make","zombi","theme","anthologya","nice","idea","onli","two","stori","fall","woefulli","short","onli","wai","thi","low","budget","gore","flick","fail","deliv","act","lousi","joe","haggerti","taletel","ebenez","jackson","give","strang","perform","ever","see","locat","uninspir","script","dreari","sex","scene","zero","nuditi","end","good","beggar","beliefbr","br","fair","syk","creativ","camerawork","effect","although","gimmicki","techniqu","emploi","charact","run","wood","tad","overus","joe","castro","cheapo","gore","enthusiast","ear","bite","eyebal","pluck","face","remov","brain","squish","messi","decapit","thi","posit","make","film","bearabl","warn","zombi","chronicl","stroll","park","even","season","viewer","zgrade","trashbr","br","give","zombi","chronicl","gener","rais","rate","sinc","get","view","film","benefit","although","sneak","suspicion","extra","dimens","make","much","differ"],"filtered2":["en","rout","small","town","lai","wai","beat","track","look","suspici","close","freewai","femal","report","run","strang","hitchhik","agre","help","direct","destin","strang","man","recount","pair","gruesom","tale","connect","area","stori","adulter","coupl","plot","kill","woman","husband","eventu","suffer","far","wrong","fate","themselv","attack","zombi","stori","group","camper","vacat","cut","short","undead","outlaw","take","umbrag","grave","pee","onbr","zombi","chronicl","attempt","writer","garrett","clanci","director","brad","syk","make","zombi","theme","anthologya","nice","idea","onli","two","stori","fall","woefulli","short","onli","wai","low","budget","gore","flick","fail","deliv","act","lousi","joe","haggerti","taletel","ebenez","jackson","give","strang","perform","ever","see","locat","uninspir","script","dreari","sex","scene","zero","nuditi","end","good","beggar","beliefbr","fair","syk","creativ","camerawork","effect","although","gimmicki","techniqu","emploi","charact","run","wood","tad","overus","joe","castro","cheapo","gore","enthusiast","ear","bite","eyebal","pluck","face","remov","brain","squish","messi","decapit","posit","make","bearabl","warn","zombi","chronicl","stroll","park","even","season

{"value":"[***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***] This movie's reputation precedes it, so it was with anticipation that I sat down to watch it in letterbox on TCM. What a major disappointment.<br /><br />The cast is superb and the production values are first-rate, but the characters are without depth, the plot is thin, and the whole thing goes on too long. For a movie that deals with alcoholism, family divisions, unfaithfulness, gambling, and sexual repression, the movie is curiously flat, prosaic, lifeless, and cliche-ridden. One example is the portrayal of Frank Hirsch's unfaithfuness: his rather heavy-handed request to his wife to \"go upstairs and relax a bit\" followed by her predictable pleading of a headache, leads - even more predictably - to his evening liaison with his secretary (\"hey Nancy, I've got the blues tonight. Let's go for a drive\"), all according to well-worn formula. We don't feel these are real people, but cardboard cutouts acting in a marionette play. Also, the source of the obvious friction between Frank and Dave Hirsch is never really explored or explained. Dave's infatuation with the on-again/off-again Gwen is inexplicable in light of her fatuous inability to defecate or get off the pot. His subsequent marriage of desperation to the Shirley Maclaine/Ginny character is, from the moment of its being presented to this viewer, anyway, obviously doomed to fail, and it was clear - by the conventions of this type of soap opera - that it could only be resolved by someone being killed. The moment the jealous lover started running around with the gun I started a bet with myself as to who - Dave or Ginny - would get killed. The whole thing was phony with a capital 'P'. <br /><br />Having said that, Maclaine's performance and that of Dean Martin are the standouts here. But on the whole I find the movie's interest to be purely that of a period piece of Hollywood

{"value":"As a gamer, I can't say I like this film. Fact is, I down right hate it. I tried to watch it as open minded as possible, but when it gets down to it, it feels rather insulting to my social group.<br /><br />To me, there are several reasons why.<br /><br />1. The characters seem unnatural. I've met lots of players, of all different walks of life. I don't know any who act like any of the characters in the film. It's like the producers of the film have taken the worst aspects of the worst stereotypes and put them all into 5 people. Most gamers are rather social people, some with rather active lives.<br /><br />2. The style doesn't work. The mockumentary style is ill suited to the subject matter of the film. An actual documentary on gamers would actually work better. While it is good looking (I.E. cleanly put together), it isn't very good.<br /><br />3. The dialogue feels forced, unnatural. It also seems to lack any real world context. Gamers swear, I'll admit that, but we don't have Tourette's Syndrome.<br /><br />4. The humor is lacking. While self-deprecating humor is a mainstay of my group and several other groups I've encountered, this is less self-deprecation, and more like toilet humor. Likewise, a large part of gamer humor is full of in-jokes and anecdotes, not toilet humor. Most gamers would balk at and shun anybody who made such jokes.<br /><br />5. The biggest problem to me is basically this: Accuracy. I don't mean rules, but instead dynamics. Invariably, this film is going to be compared to the even lower budget films The Gamers and The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, both of which portray the players as actual people playing an actual game. The difference is, Gamers: The Movie presents a situation where you want to beat the players senseless vs. The Gamers, where you can say something like: \"Huh, I know a guy like that...

{"value":"Quite possibly the nicest woman in show business, and the sexiest, Debbie gives another fine performance here. Although her work in American Nightmare was far superior, she is still worth watching in this film.<br /><br />The cast is filled with your typical Melrose Place types, chiseled features and seductive curves, that I had never seen before. Other than Debbie, Laura Nativo was the only actress I had seen before, in the similar Delta Delta Die.<br /><br />The plot centers around a group of California arrogants who initiate poor naive Debbie Rochon into their clique. They tell her that they have a murder club, and that she must kill someone to be accepted. Debbie wants nothing more but to be accepted by these cool people, so she quickly kills a person, and now the group must decide what to do with her, after she fell for their joke.<br /><br />VIOLENCE: $$$$$ (Plentiful! Debbie Rochon occasionally has blood splattered all over her and all of the murder scenes are done in your face. Gore hounds will surely enjoy!)<br /><br />NUDITY: $$$$$ (Plentiful as well! Debbie Rochon has several nude scenes as do many of the no-name actresses and actors. The pool party seems as just an excuse to get everyone naked; man and woman alike. Julie Strain also has a topless cameo but her character is gone after the first five minutes).<br /><br />STORY: $$ (Could have received a higher vote because the plot was very interesting and unique but the plot serves as filler between nude scenes. I understand that B-Rate films use nudity often, but this is borderline excessive).<br /><br />ACTING: $ (The acting is sub standard to say the least.

{"value":"A slasher flick, made in the early 80's, has a curse on it which has anyone who tries to finish it turning up dead. Years later, a group of film students attempted to complete the movie - also resurrecting the films deadly curse. Great idea for a film, but sadly 'Cut' is just another wasted opportunity.<br /><br />Unfortunately Australia hasn't had the world's best track record when it comes to horror. 'Razorback' (1984) was an out and out dud as was 'Holwing III' (1987), which was half an American film anyway. As for our foray into comedy-horror, 'Body Melt' (1993) is best left forgotten. The problem with 'Cut' is that the makers trying to create a clever horror satire a la 'Scream' (1996) but have no insight into the genre or what makes it work. And although this sounds weird me saying this about a slasher film but what 'Cut' really lacks is any \"heart\". Sure it follows the basic \"rules\" established by 'Scream', but it doesn't want to play with the formula, instead it goes for a cardboard copy of the earlier.<br /><br />The killer, Scarman, is probably one of the most boring and uncharismatic villains in horror movie history. His endless barrage awkwardly, lame one-liners would make the dialogue of a porno seem like Shakespeare. The cast never seem like their fully involved and look like their just waiting for a shoot to be over so they can collect their pay checks. And the feel of the film is like it's deliberately trying not to be creepy; looking more like an episode of 'Neighbors' or 'Heartbreak High'. By the way, those attempts at MTV style, hyper-cinema during the \"research\" sequence just look lame, dated and out of place.<br /><br />If Australia ever gets a chance to do horror again (Which I hope we still do) maybe we should take a leaf from the 'Mad Max' (1979) book. Instead of trying to copy the U.S. we should be trying our own take on the genre.","finished_norm":["a","slasher","flick","make","in","the","earli","have","a","curs","on","it","which","have","anyon","who","try","to","finish","it","turn","up","dead","year","late","a","group","of","film","student","attempt","to","complet","the","movi","conjur","resurrect","the","film","deadli","curs","great","idea","for","a","film","but","sadli","cut","be","just","anoth","wast","opportunitybr","br","unfortun","australia","have","not","have","the","world","well","track","record","when","it","come","to","horror","razorback","be","a","out","and","out","dud","a","be","holw","iii","which","be","half","a","american","film","anywai","a","for","our","forai","into","comedyhorror","bodi","melt","be","well","leav","forget","the","problem","with","cut","be","that","the","maker","try","to","creat","a","clever","horror","satir","a","la","scream","but","have","no","insight","into","the","genr","or","what","make","it","work","and","although","thi","sound","weird","me","sai","thi","about","a","slasher","film","but","what","cut","realli","lack","be","ani","heart","sure","it","follow","the","basic","rule","establish","by","scream","but","it","doe","not","want","to","plai","with","the","formula","instead","it","go","for","a","cardboard","copi","of","the","earlierbr","br","the","killer","scarman","be","probabl","on","of","the","much","bore","and","uncharismat","villain","in","horror","movi","histori","hi","endless","barrag","awkwardli","lame","onelin","would","make","the","dialogu","of","a","porno","seem","like","shakespear","the","cast","never","seem","like","their","fulli","involv","and","look","like","their","just","wait","for","a","shoot","to","be","over","so","thei","can","collect","their","pai","check","and","the","feel","of","the","film","be","like","it","deliber","try","not","to","be","creepi","look","much","like","a","episod","of","neighbor","or","heartbreak","high","by","the","wai","that","attempt","at","mtv","styl","hypercinema","dure","the","research","sequenc","just","look","lame","date","and","out","of","placebr","br","if","australia","ever","get","a","chanc","to","do","horror","again","which","i","hope","we","still","do","mayb","we","should","take","a","leaf","from","the","mad","max","book","instead","of","try","to","copi","the","u","we","should","be","try","our","own","take","on","the","genr"],"filtered":["slasher","flick","make","earli","curs","anyon","try","finish","turn","dead","year","late","group","film","student","attempt","complet","movi","conjur","resurrect","film","deadli","curs","great","idea","film","sadli","cut","anoth","wast","opportunitybr","br","unfortun","australia","world","well","track","record","come","horror","razorback","dud","holw","iii","half","american","film","anywai","forai","comedyhorror","bodi","melt","well","leav","forget","problem","cut","maker","try","creat","clever","horror","satir","la","scream","insight","genr","make","work","although","thi","sound","weird","sai","thi","slasher","film","cut","realli","lack","ani","heart","sure","follow","basic","rule","establish","scream","doe","want","plai","formula","instead","go","cardboard","copi","earlierbr","br","killer","scarman","probabl","much","bore","uncharismat","villain","horror","movi","histori","hi","endless","barrag","awkwardli","lame","onelin","make","dialogu","porno","seem","like","shakespear","cast","never","seem","like","fulli","involv","look","like","wait","shoot","thei","collect","pai","check","feel","film","like","deliber","try","creepi","look","much","like","episod","neighbor","heartbreak","high","wai","attempt","mtv","styl","hypercinema","dure","research","sequenc","look","lame","date","placebr","br","australia","ever","get","chanc","horror","hope","still","mayb","take","leaf","mad","max","book","instead","try","copi","u","try","take","genr"],"filtered2":["slasher","flick","make","earli","curs","anyon","try","finish","turn","dead","year","late","group","student","attempt","complet","conjur","resurrect","deadli","curs","great","idea","sadli","cut","anoth","wast","opportunitybr","unfortun","australia","world","well","track","record","come","horror","razorback","dud","holw","iii","half","american","anywai","forai","comedyhorror","bodi","melt","well","leav","forget","problem","cut","maker","try","creat","clever","horror","satir","la","scream","insight","genr","make","work","although","sound","weird","slasher","cut","realli","lack","ani","heart","sure","follow","basic","rule","establish","scream","doe","want","plai","formula","instead","go","cardboard","copi","earlierbr","killer","scarman","probabl","bore","uncharismat","villain","horror","histori","endless","barrag","awkwardli","lame","onelin","make","dialogu","porno","seem","like","shakespear","cast","never","seem","like","fulli","involv","look","like","wait","shoot","collect","pai","check","feel","like","deliber","try","creepi","look","like","neighbor","heartbreak","high","wai","attempt","mtv","styl","hypercinema","dure","research","sequenc","look","lame","date","p

{"value":"I could barely keep myself from either nodding off or just turning off this turd, but I decided to stick it out if only for the reasoning that maybe *something* would happen. This is the work of a writer/producer/director/special fx, Kenneth Herts, who wants to make a statement on ecological damage while making a monster movie. That's what he wanted, anyway. What it turns out to be is a lot of acting, either slightly hammy or just mundane and without much merit, and scenes that seem to repeat themselves as the monster ATTACKS in the river waters (oh, and what luck, a woman just happens to be naked in it... even though there have already been DISAPPEARANCES!) <br /><br />This is just nonsensical stuff, but I suppose it's not too harmful; it's not very obnoxious at the least and once or twice we get a semi-interesting peek at Brazilian \"culture\" (which is the father walking through town with his flock or other pieces of a semblance of 'hey, this is NOT America!'). But whatever hope the director had in casting Mitchum or Carradine is squandered on at best pedestrian and at worst excruciatingly banal and dumb dialog. It doesn't help that when we finally get something of a good look at the monster and the \"action\" happens, it too is stupidly staged and with only sleazy appeal. Usually I would feel sorry for a filmmaker who had a lot of problems getting a particular picture finished- in this case it took the better part of the mid 70s- but with Monstroid or Monster or whatever it's called... nah.<br /><br />If you happen to get the Elvira DVD double-feature of this (bad print with bad transfer quality) with Blue Sunshine, make sure to skip this one.

{"value":"What's wrong with this film? Many, many things. The editing tries too hard to look good, and does nothing but confuse the viewer whilst also supplying him/her with a powerful headache. The plot is muddled and obviously prolonged from what started as a short (story or film). The plot only makes for less than ten minutes of good story, and this is just stretched out painfully until it reached the minimum length for a feature film. We all know what happens to things when we stretch them, right? Exactly. They get thinner. In the end, the plot is just so paper-thin that you might even miss it, if you aren't paying attention, which is hard to do when watching this movie. The acting is not even slightly impressive. The characters are poorly written and dull, uninteresting. One of the worst things that are wrong with this film is that apparently, whoever was in charge of the score/soundtrack had no idea what the movie was, or what it was supposed to be about(not that I blame him, I couldn't figure it out either). As a result, half of the music in the film doesn't fit the scenes at all. Also, what was with all the sexual undertones between Eliza Dushku and the main character? Naturally, this was in order to attract young males, but it was just so cheaply done. And did the first scene have anything to do with the rest of the film? On any conceivable level? At all? The two creepy guys didn't seem to have anything to do with the film at all, they were just there in order to have some chase scenes. I doubt anyone would really enjoy a film so poorly put together and such a shameless and awful Hollywood-like attempt at a somewhat interesting idea. But I digress. I recommend this to teenagers with low attention spans who don't mind a really bad horror-thriller as long as there's some sex and gore in it(although that may only be true for the Killer Cut, which I saw).

{"value":"The second attempt by a New York intellectual in less than 10 years to make a \"Swedish\" film - the first being Susan Sontag's \"Brother Carl\" (which was made in Sweden, with Swedish actors, no less!) The results? Oscar Wilde said it best, in reference to Dickens' \"The Old Curiosity Shop\": \"One would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of Little Nell.\" Pretty much the same thing here. \"Interiors\" is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers. (\"I'm afraid of my anger.\" Looking into the middle distance: \"I don't like who I'm becoming.\") The directorial quotations (to use a polite term) from Bergman are close to parody. The incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. (\"I read a poem of yours the other day. It was in - I don't know - The New Yorker.\" \"Oh. That was an old poem. I reworked it.\") Far from not caring about these people, however, I found them quite hilarious. Much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from Allen's earlier films - only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight. Having not cast himself in the movie, he has poor Mary Beth Hurt copy all of his thespian tics, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (much like Kenneth Branagh in \"Celebrity\").<br /><br />The basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from Bergman's \"Winter Light,\" the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst. It all comes through in the shopworn visual/aural tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.<br /><br />Allen's later \"serious\" films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining.

{"value":"BRIEF ENCOUNTER is a ghastly and pointless remake of the 1945 David Lean classic, which was based on Noel Coward's play \"Still Life\". A doctor removes a particle of grit from a woman's eye at a railway station, he is in a miserable relationship, she is happily married social worker of Italian ancestry. They meet by accident on another occasion, form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each other every Wednesday. The pair fall in love, but after spending a few afternoons together they realise that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to part. Coward's original one-act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love. Sophia Loren and Richard Burton, two Super Stars and veterans of Hollywood Epics, are nobody's idea of 'ordinary people'. Loren in particular is miscast - Sophia Loren in full make-up, looking like a million dollars, working as a part-time voluntary social worker at a Citizen Advice Bureau just doesn't ring true. Burton, looking haggard, with dyed hair, too much make-up and wearing platform shoes, doesn't come across as your average General Practitioner. That said, you can't really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses. Burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings penning poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt. Loren's husband, Jack Hedley, potters around the house all day and is terminally boring: the most exciting thing he has ever done is nearly have an affair six years previous. Their final scene together will induce nausea, (\"You've been a long, long way away\", etc.). That great British jobbing actor, John LeMesurier, has a three minute cameo as Burton's friend, and appears to be slightly inebriated, speaking his lines in a barely audible voice. It's a sad and forgettable performance in a dismal, awful rehash of a cinema classic.

{"value":"\"Phantasm\" of 1979 was a highly atmospheric, creepy, scary and very original Horror flick, and, in one word, cult. The first sequel of 1988 was gory, witty, action-packed and highly entertaining. After the first sequel however, \"Phantasm\" creator Don Coscarelly apparently lacked new ideas. \"Phantasm III - Lord Of The Dead\" of 1994 is certainly not a complete failure, it even is quite entertaining, but there is no more originality, and the desperate attempts to bring in something new, are at times tiresome, which makes it quite disappointing in comparison to its predecessors. <br /><br />- SPOILERS - <br /><br />Quite in the beginning, we are introduced the secret behind the mysterious sentinel spheres (the brain-sucking flying silver balls) is unraveled. Thenceforward, a number of unnecessary and annoying new characters (such as Tim, a \"Home Alone\"-style little kid who happens to be great at shooting, an Rocky, a tough and super-cool nunchaku-swinging black chick with a crew cut) are introduced. The film also has its qualities - Reggie Bannister is again very cool as the pony-tailed, guitar playing Reggie. Angus Scrimm is still quite creepy as the Tall Man, but the fact that the Tall Man talks a lot more in this film, makes him loose some of his creepiness. The character of Mike is played by A. Michael Baldwin again (he had been replaced by James LeGros in Part 2), which, in my opinion, doesn't make much of a difference. The gore also keeps the film interesting enough to watch, but it is still a disappointment, especially because the attempts to make up for the lack of ideas get annoying quite quickly.<br /><br />All things considered, \"Phantasm III\" is an acceptable time-waster, but it is definitely disappointing compared to its predecessors. Fans of the first two \"Phantasm\" films can give it a try, but I recommend not to set your expectations too high.","finished_norm":["phantasm","of","be","a","highli","atmospher","creepi","scari","and","veri","origin","horror","flick","and","in","on","word","cult","the","sequel","of","be","gori","witti","actionpack","and","highli","entertain","after","the","sequel","howev","phantasm","creator","don","coscarelli","appar","lack","new","idea","phantasm","iii","lord","of","the","dead","of","be","certainli","not","a","complet","failur","it","even","be","quit","entertain","but","there","be","no","much","origin","and","the","desper","attempt","to","bring","in","someth","new","be","at","time","tiresom","which","make","it","quit","disappoint","in","comparison","to","it","predecessor","br","br","spoiler","br","br","quit","in","the","begin","we","be","introduc","the","secret","behind","the","mysteri","sentinel","sphere","the","brainsuck","fly","silver","ball","be","unravel","thenceforward","a","numb","of","unnecessari","and","annoi","new","charact","such","a","tim","a","home","alonestyl","littl","kid","who","happen","to","be","great","at","shoot","a","rocki","a","tough","and","supercool","nunchakuswing","black","chick","with","a","crow","cut","be","introduc","the","film","conjur","have","it","qualiti","reggi","bannist","be","again","veri","cool","a","the","ponytail","guitar","plai","reggi","angu","scrimm","be","still","quit","creepi","a","the","tall","man","but","the","fact","that","the","tall","man","talk","a","lot","much","in","thi","film","make","him","loos","some","of","hi","creepi","the","charact","of","mike","be","plai","by","a","michael","baldwin","again","he","have","be","replac","by","jame","legro","in","part","which","in","my","opinion","doe","not","make","much","of","a","differ","the","gore","conjur","keep","the","film","interest","enough","to","watch","but","it","be","still","a","disappoint","especi","becaus","the","attempt","to","make","up","for","the","lack","of","idea","get","annoi","quit","quicklybr","br","all","thing","consid","phantasm","iii","be","a","accept","timewast","but","it","be","definit","disappoint","compar","to","it","predecessor","fan","of","the","two","phantasm","film","can","give","it","a","try","but","i","recommend","not","to","set","your","expect","too","high"],"filtered":["phantasm","highli","atmospher","creepi","scari","veri","origin","horror","flick","word","cult","sequel","gori","witti","actionpack","highli","entertain","sequel","howev","phantasm","creator","coscarelli","appar","lack","new","idea","phantasm","iii","lord","dead","certainli","complet","failur","even","quit","entertain","much","origin","desper","attempt","bring","someth","new","time","tiresom","make","quit","disappoint","comparison","predecessor","br","br","spoiler","br","br","quit","begin","introduc","secret","behind","mysteri","sentinel","sphere","brainsuck","fly","silver","ball","unravel","thenceforward","numb","unnecessari","annoi","new","charact","tim","home","alonestyl","littl","kid","happen","great","shoot","rocki","tough","supercool","nunchakuswing","black","chick","crow","cut","introduc","film","conjur","qualiti","reggi","bannist","veri","cool","ponytail","guitar","plai","reggi","angu","scrimm","still","quit","creepi","tall","man","fact","tall","man","talk","lot","much","thi","film","make","loos","hi","creepi","charact","mike","plai","michael","baldwin","replac","jame","legro","part","opinion","doe","make","much","differ","gore","conjur","keep","film","interest","enough","watch","still","disappoint","especi","becaus","attempt","make","lack","idea","get","annoi","quit","quicklybr","br","thing","consid","phantasm","iii","accept","timewast","definit","disappoint","compar","predecessor","fan","two","phantasm","film","give","try","recommend","set","expect","high"],"filtered2":["phantasm","highli","atmospher","creepi","scari","veri","origin","horror","flick","word","cult","sequel","gori","witti","actionpack","highli","entertain","sequel","howev","phantasm","creator","coscarelli","appar","lack","new","idea","phantasm","iii","lord","dead","certainli","complet","failur","even","quit","entertain","origin","desper","attempt","bring","someth","new","time","tiresom","make","quit","disappoint","comparison","predecessor","spoiler","quit","begin","introduc","secret","behind","mysteri","sentinel","sphere","brainsuck","fly","silver","ball","unravel","thenceforward","numb","unnecessari","annoi","new","charact","tim","home","alonestyl","littl","kid","happen","great","shoot","rocki","tough","supercool","nunchakuswing","black","chick","crow","cut","introduc","conjur","qualiti","reggi","bannist","veri","cool","ponytail","guitar","plai","reggi","angu","scrimm","still","quit","creepi","tall","man","fact","tall","man","talk","lot","make","loos","creepi","charact","mike","plai","michael","baldwin","replac","jame","legro","part","opinion","doe","make","differ","gore","conjur","keep","interest","enough","watch","still","disappoint","especi","becaus","attempt","make","lack","idea","get","annoi","quit","quicklybr","thing","consid","phantasm","ii

{"value":"Like most comments I saw this film under the name of The Witching which is the reissue title. Apparently Necromancy which is the original is better but I doubt it.<br /><br />Most scenes of the witching still include most necromancy scenes and these are still bad. In many ways I think the added nudity of the witching at least added some entertainment value! But don't be fooled -there's only 3 scenes with nudity and it's of the people standing around variety. No diabolique rumpy pumpy involved!<br /><br />This movie is so inherently awful it's difficult to know what to criticise first. The dialogue is awful and straight out of the Troma locker. At least Troma is tongue in cheek though. This is straight-faced boredom personified. The acting is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora the possessed kid in The Innocents would you believe!) the worst with her high-pitched screechy voice. Welles seems merely waiting for his pay cheque. The other female lead has a creepy face so I don't know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the film! And the doctor is pretty bad too. He also looks worringly like Gene Wilder.<br /><br />It is ineptly filmed with scenes changing for no reason and editing is choppy. This is because the witching is a copy and paste job and not a subtle one at that. Only the lighting is OK. The sound is also dreadful and it's difficult to hear with the appalling new soundtrack which never shuts up. The 'ghost' mother is also equally rubbish but the actress is so hilariously bad at acting that at least it provides some unintentional laughs.<br /><br />Really this film (the witching at least) is only for the unwary.

{"value":"What the F*@# was this I just watched? Steven STOP!! Please! This movie is insatiably bad and silly. In a bizarre departure from action and adventure, Mr. Seagal is now fighting (obviously) wish-they-were-vampire 'like' creatures with super human strength.? OK? Oh, and their eyes blink sideways in an inhuman way? Wow! Even still in this movie however, to quell Seagals have-to-have-the-last-punch-and-no-one-can-kick-my-a$$ ego, HE is somehow stronger than they are. However all of the average humans are getting crushed all around him. Come on, I can understand the big mouth neighborhood bully or drug dealer, but these are super human strength people. Oh and get this, Seagal goes through a brief sting of identity issues, because apparently he and his cohorts in the film think he is Wolverine! Oh My GO... And worst than all of that! Yes, there is a worse than that. He has a voice over even changing voice in mid sentence while we are looking at his face. They obviously sound nothing like him and I believe it may be one of the other actors in the film. It was pure madness. Although I wanted to turn it off I always watch a movie to he end. This is an all time low even for your direct to video movies Steven. Awful! Awful! Awful! Two thumbs down! Redemeption qualities? Well I guess so, I will be fair in that aspect. At least some of the special effects were OK, and I like the choice of wardrobe for the actors and actresses. The women all were quite attractive IMO. Still, and I said STILL, it does not make up for the blatant X-Men, Underworld, (insert your favorite zombie, vampire movie here) rip off! The director, writer, producer, ALL should be bansihed & exile from the movie business. I think I feel the way that most people feel about Blood Rayne (and just about all other Uwe Boll pictures) about this film. That's my whole $1.00 on this film.

{"value":"I'm not going to comb over TLPS's obvious peterbogdanovichian flaws. Instead, I shall take a look at the positive aspects of this overrated celluloid pygmy of a film.<br /><br />1. Peter Bogdanovich managed to make a movie that can be endured in its entirety. This fact alone places the movie high up above and all the way up to the top of his lame filmography.<br /><br />2. Bogdanovich had shown how amazingly generous some lucky boyfriends can be, by sharing Cybill Shepherd's (his then-gal) fabulous body and breasts with his male audience - and not just on one but on two occasions. Brava! The unquestionable highlights of this cinematic festa del siesta.<br /><br />3. TLPS has barely a scene without stereotypical country music doodling in the background. (Peter tried to make the obvious point that the movie is set in America's Deep South (as if it weren't bleedin' obvious) so he hammered that point on and on and on...) How is this an advantage, you might ask? Well, when the movie finally ends and the monotonous country music finally ceases massaging your tired ear-drums, you start experiencing a strange exhilaration: \"The movie's finally over!\" It's pure joy.<br /><br />4. The movie gives all women who look like Cloris Leachman hope. Hope that they, too, may one day snatch a much younger and maybe even good-looking boyfriend.<br /><br />5. Cloris Leachman's biography (which I realize isn't technically a part of TLPS) gives hope to all women that look like that, that they too may one day win a Miss Chicago beauty pageant. (Provided they have enough money to bribe the jury with.)<br /><br />(You think I'm joking abut Cloris having won a beauty pageant, huh?

{"value":"I know no one cares, but I do. This film is historic for one reason. It is the unity of two heroes from two great seventies sci-fi films. Well, one is great, and one is quite bad. The great one is truly great, in fact it's the best. The bad one is truly bad, in fact it's the worst. Of course of the great I refer to \"Star Wars\" and it's star Mark Hamill, aka \"Luke Skywalker\", who is the hero of this film about a kid who gets his Vette swiped and then goes to Vegas (on a lead) and after a whole lot of adventures, eventually recovers it. (Since he's into fixing cars I guess you can call him \"Lube Skywalker\"). Along the way he meets a hooker with a heart of gold, and ends up facing off with a character played by Kim Milford, the hero from the seventies sci-fi cult film \"Laserblast\", which is, as I've hinted at earlier, the worst sci-fi film ever made. Milford plays the lead baddie whom Hamill must steal his car back from. I realize that no one cares about this meeting of two great sci-fi heroes, but I do. And I also must say that this is one of the best/worst movies of all time. Mark Hamill's acting needs the force, the plot needs extensive Jedi training, and the character of the hooker played by Annie Potts just might be the most annoying character of all time, ever, in any film I've ever seen. But it's a fun movie to watch on a weekend day, or a weekday night, late at night, very late. It's one of those films that meanders, looking for something but without quite finding it and yet, at the same time, it's entire purpose is, like free-form jazz, to simply exist as is. And it does. And what is, isn't that great, but you can't say it isn't entertaining, because for an hour and a half you might feel ripped off, but you won't feel cheated. So turn off your mind, relax, and enjoy this muddled gem without any expectations, and may the force be with you,

{"value":"This film is one giant pant load. Paul Schrader is utterly lost in his own bad screenplay. And his directing is about as comatose as it can be without his actually having been sleepwalking during the process. <br /><br />The worst though is Woody Harrelson, whom I ordinarily like when he's properly cast. He plays \"the walker\", a homosexual man in D.C. who plays social companion to the bored wives of the Washington elite. He couldn't have been more one dimensional if he had been cut out of a magazine and bounced around in front of the camera on a popsicle stick. His \"southern accent\" is that \"off the rack\" version that decrescendos from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers, as though the heat and humidity of the South is still draining him of every ounce of energy he has. It is monotonous. But, his is not the worst accent in the movie. His \"boyfriend\", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, attempts to affect some kind of a Mid East accent that is so clumsy he can barely deliver the bad lines written for him. He is incapable of rolling his r's in spite of the fact that in real life he is German, and speaks several languages - one of them being Italian! That's kind of a good reason to cast someone else don't ya think? <br /><br />From the story, to the screenplay, to the directing, to the camera work, to the performances by the leads, this movie is bad from beginning to end. The only tolerable moments in this film came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall, and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed to make it through this movie with their dignity in tact. In fact, all three are excellent, in spite of being trapped in a really bad film. Ufortunately, no one could ever be good enough to redeem this endless series of flaws. If you like these three actresses, watch them in something else. This movie is not worth your
