{"value":"Yes, I am just going to tell you about this one so don't read if you want surprises. I got this one with the title Christmas Evil. There was also another Christmas horror on the DVD called Silent Night, Bloody Night. Whereas Silent Night, Bloody Night (not to be confused with Silent Night, Deadly Night) had lots of potential and was very close to being good, this one wasn't quite as good. It started out interesting enough watching the villain (if you can call him that) watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice, but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie doesn't deliver. You need character development, but this goes overboard and you are still never sure why the heck the guy snaps. About an hour in he kills three of four people while a whole crowd watches in terror, and the guys he kills aren't even his targets they are just making fun of him. This is one of many unsuccessful attempts by the killer to knock of the naughty. He then proceeds to try and kill this other guy, and he tries to break into his house by squeezing himself into the fireplace. He promptly gets stuck and barely manages to get out. He then enters through the basement and then tries to kill the guy by smothering him in his bedroom. He can't seem to kill the guy this way so he grabs a star off the tree and slits the guys throat. What the heck was a tree even doing in the bedroom in the first place? Oh yeah, the killer before this kill stopped off at a party and had some fun too. Well that is about it except for the town people chasing him with torches and the unresolved part with his brother and that tune he wants to play. What was that even about? He kept talking about something that was never really explained. How does it end you ask, well since I have spoilers I will tell you. He runs off the road in his van and proceeds to, well lets just say it was lame!!!!!!!!!!!!","finished_norm":["ye","i","be","just","go","to","tell","you","about","thi","on","so","do","not","read","if","you","want","surpris","i","get","thi","on","with","the","titl","christma","evil","there","be","conjur","anoth","christma","horror","on","the","dvd","call","silent","night","bloodi","night","wherea","silent","night","bloodi","night","not","to","be","confus","with","silent","night","deadli","night","have","lot","of","potenti","and","be","veri","close","to","be","good","thi","on","be","not","quit","a","good","it","start","out","interest","enough","watch","the","villain","if","you","can","call","him","that","watch","the","neighborhood","kid","and","write","in","book","about","who","be","naughti","and","nice","but","after","awhil","you","be","look","for","some","action","and","thi","movi","doe","not","deliv","you","ne","charact","develop","but","thi","go","overboard","and","you","be","still","never","sure","why","the","heck","the","gui","snap","about","a","hour","in","he","kill","three","of","four","peopl","while","a","whole","crowd","watch","in","terror","and","the","gui","he","kill","be","not","even","hi","target","thei","be","just","make","fun","of","him","thi","be","on","of","mani","unsuccess","attempt","by","the","killer","to","knock","of","the","naughti","he","then","proce","to","try","and","kill","thi","other","gui","and","he","try","to","break","into","hi","hous","by","squeez","himself","into","the","fireplac","he","promptli","get","stick","and","bare","manag","to","get","out","he","then","enter","through","the","basem","and","then","try","to","kill","the","gui","by","smother","him","in","hi","bedroom","he","ca","not","seem","to","kill","the","gui","thi","wai","so","he","grab","a","star","off","the","tree","and","slit","the","gui","throat","what","the","heck","be","a","tree","even","do","in","the","bedroom","in","the","place","oh","ye","the","killer","befor","thi","kill","stop","off","at","a","parti","and","have","some","fun","too","good","that","be","about","it","except","for","the","town","peopl","chase","him","with","torch","and","the","unresolv","part","with","hi","brother","and","that","tune","he","want","to","plai","what","be","that","even","about","he","keep","talk","about","someth","that","be","never","realli","explain","how","doe","it","end","you","ask","good","sinc","i","have","spoiler","i","will","tell","you","he","run","off","the","road","in","hi","van","and","proce","to","good","let","just","sai","it","be","lame"],"filtered":["ye","go","tell","thi","read","want","surpris","get","thi","titl","christma","evil","conjur","anoth","christma","horror","dvd","call","silent","night","bloodi","night","wherea","silent","night","bloodi","night","confus","silent","night","deadli","night","lot","potenti","veri","close","good","thi","quit","good","start","interest","enough","watch","villain","call","watch","neighborhood","kid","write","book","naughti","nice","awhil","look","action","thi","movi","doe","deliv","ne","charact","develop","thi","go","overboard","still","never","sure","heck","gui","snap","hour","kill","three","four","peopl","whole","crowd","watch","terror","gui","kill","even","hi","target","thei","make","fun","thi","mani","unsuccess","attempt","killer","knock","naughti","proce","try","kill","thi","gui","try","break","hi","hous","squeez","fireplac","promptli","get","stick","bare","manag","get","enter","basem","try","kill","gui","smother","hi","bedroom","ca","seem","kill","gui","thi","wai","grab","star","tree","slit","gui","throat","heck","tree","even","bedroom","place","oh","ye","killer","befor","thi","kill","stop","parti","fun","good","except","town","peopl","chase","torch","unresolv","part","hi","brother","tune","want","plai","even","keep","talk","someth","never","realli","explain","doe","end","ask","good","sinc","spoiler","tell","run","road","hi","van","proce","good","let","sai","lame"],"filtered2":["ye","go","tell","read","want","surpris","get","titl","christma","evil","conjur","anoth","christma","horror","dvd","call","silent","night","bloodi","night","wherea","silent","night","bloodi","night","confus","silent","night","deadli","night","lot","potenti","veri","close","good","quit","good","start","interest","enough","watch","villain","call","watch","neighborhood","kid","write","book","naughti","nice","awhil","look","action","doe","deliv","ne","charact","develop","go","overboard","still","never","sure","heck","gui","snap","hour","kill","three","four","peopl","whole","crowd","watch","terror","gui","kill","even","target","make","fun","mani","unsuccess","attempt","killer","knock","naughti","proce","try","kill","gui","try","break","hous","squeez","fireplac","promptli","get","stick","bare","manag","get","enter","basem","try","kill","gui","smother","bedroom","ca","seem","kill","gui","wai","grab","star","tree","slit","gui","throat","heck","tree","even","bedroom","place","oh","ye","killer","befor","kill","stop","parti","fun","good","except","town","peopl","chase","torch","unresol

{"value":"That's not just my considered verdict on this film, but also on the bulk of what has been written about it. Now don't get me wrong here either, I'm not a total philistine, I didn't hate the movie because it wasn't enough like 'police academy 9' or whatever, I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff, I swear.<br /><br />'Magnolia' is poor, and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed. Long winded, self indulgent, rambling nonsense from start to finish, there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie. There's some high calibre actors fair enough, and none turns in an average or worse performance. Furthermore, my wife (a self confessed Tom Cruise hater) tells me it's his career best performance by far. But the plot is so completely unengaging, meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail's pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something.<br /><br />It doesn't help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with (well I didn't think so, but I don't like most people admittedly). They all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length, demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever-so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route. Yadda yadda yadda. The soundtrack's dire as well, with that marrow-suckingly irritating quality that I had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisette.<br /><br />All in all, it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of 'Friends' whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat. The bit with the frogs is good though.","finished_norm":["that","not","just","my","consid","verdict","on","thi","film","but","conjur","on","the","bulk","of","what","have","be","write","about","it","now","do","not","get","me","wrong","here","either","i","be","not","a","total","philistin","i","do","not","hate","the","movi","becaus","it","be","not","enough","like","polic","academi","or","whatev","i","enjoi","much","than","my","fair","share","of","high","brow","or","arti","stuff","i","swearbr","br","magnolia","be","poor","and","i","be","honestli","mystifi","a","to","why","it","be","seemingli","so","acclaim","long","wind","self","indulg","rambl","nonsens","from","start","to","finish","there","be","just","so","littl","that","can","credibli","be","what","peopl","so","love","about","the","movi","there","some","high","calibr","actor","fair","enough","and","none","turn","in","a","averag","or","wrong","perform","furthermor","my","wife","a","self","confess","tom","cruis","hater","tell","me","it","hi","career","well","perform","by","far","but","the","plot","be","so","complet","unengag","meander","between","the","stori","of","sever","loos","connect","charact","at","such","a","snail","pace","that","even","when","signific","life","chang","event","be","depict","thei","seem","so","pointless","and","uninterest","you","find","yourself","cry","out","for","someon","to","get","blow","up","or","somethingbr","br","it","doe","not","help","that","none","of","the","charact","be","veri","easi","to","identifi","or","empathis","with","good","i","do","not","think","so","but","i","do","not","like","much","peopl","admittedli","thei","all","plai","out","their","rather","unentertain","life","stori","at","great","length","demonstr","their","charact","flaw","and","emot","in","everso","intric","detail","and","plai","out","their","deep","and","meaning","relationship","to","the","nth","degre","with","mani","a","waffl","soliloqui","en","rout","yadda","yadda","yadda","the","soundtrack","dire","a","good","with","that","marrowsuckingli","irrit","qualiti","that","i","have","hitherto","think","uniqu","to","the","music","of","alani","morisettebr","br","all","in","all","it","be","about","a","enjoy","a","three","hour","a","be","forc","to","repeatedli","watch","a","episod","of","friend","whilst","be","intermitt","poke","in","the","rib","by","a","disgruntl","nanni","goat","the","bite","with","the","frog","be","good","though"],"filtered":["consid","verdict","thi","film","conjur","bulk","write","get","wrong","either","total","philistin","hate","movi","becaus","enough","like","polic","academi","whatev","enjoi","much","fair","share","high","brow","arti","stuff","swearbr","br","magnolia","poor","honestli","mystifi","seemingli","acclaim","long","wind","self","indulg","rambl","nonsens","start","finish","littl","credibli","peopl","love","movi","high","calibr","actor","fair","enough","none","turn","averag","wrong","perform","furthermor","wife","self","confess","tom","cruis","hater","tell","hi","career","well","perform","far","plot","complet","unengag","meander","stori","sever","loos","connect","charact","snail","pace","even","signific","life","chang","event","depict","thei","seem","pointless","uninterest","find","cry","someon","get","blow","somethingbr","br","doe","help","none","charact","veri","easi","identifi","empathis","good","think","like","much","peopl","admittedli","thei","plai","rather","unentertain","life","stori","great","length","demonstr","charact","flaw","emot","everso","intric","detail","plai","deep","meaning","relationship","nth","degre","mani","waffl","soliloqui","en","rout","yadda","yadda","yadda","soundtrack","dire","good","marrowsuckingli","irrit","qualiti","hitherto","think","uniqu","music","alani","morisettebr","br","enjoy","three","hour","forc","repeatedli","watch","episod","friend","whilst","intermitt","poke","rib","disgruntl","nanni","goat","bite","frog","good","though"],"filtered2":["consid","verdict","conjur","bulk","write","get","wrong","either","total","philistin","hate","becaus","enough","like","polic","academi","whatev","enjoi","fair","share","high","brow","arti","stuff","swearbr","magnolia","poor","honestli","mystifi","seemingli","acclaim","long","wind","self","indulg","rambl","nonsens","start","finish","littl","credibli","peopl","love","high","calibr","actor","fair","enough","none","turn","averag","wrong","perform","furthermor","wife","self","confess","tom","cruis","hater","tell","career","well","perform","far","plot","complet","unengag","meander","stori","sever","loos","connect","charact","snail","pace","even","signific","life","chang","event","depict","seem","pointless","uninterest","find","cry","someon","get","blow","somethingbr","doe","help","none","charact","veri","easi","identifi","empathis","good","think","like","peopl","admittedli","plai","rather","unentertain","life","stori","great","length","demonstr","charact","flaw","emot","everso","intric","detail","plai","deep","meaning","relationship","nth","degre","mani","waffl","soliloqui","en","rout","yadda","yadda

{"value":"Feeding The Masses was just another movie trying to make a little money off of the zombie craze that is going around, mostly due to the popularity of movies such as Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series.<br /><br />It starts at a television station, which is guarded by the military, and are reporting that The Lazarus Virus (zombies) are close to containment and the city will soon be free to do their business again. The problem is, this is totally false. Zombies are running rampantly and only a small minority of people are aware. Among them are Torch (William Garberina), the camera man, Sherry (Rachael Morris), the lead anchor woman (who for some reason is listed as playing Shelly on this website) and Roger (Patrick Cohen), their military escort. Torch and Sherry are against lying to the people but the station is being run by secret service (or some other government agency) and they are heavily censored.<br /><br />This movie gives itself a pat on the back on the box-cover saying \"We hold FEEDING THE MASSES on a higher level than any o the three 'of the Dead' films by George A. Rombero.\" The source of that quote has lost ALL credibility with me.<br /><br />Let me just say that this movie is BAD. I don't mean bad like I was expecting more (I obviously was, though) but I mean bad in that I could not find any redeeming qualities in the film, whatsoever. The acting in all parts are either over done or too wooden. Did anybody remember their lines or are they reading off of cue cards? I can't even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actor/actress. There really was not one. If I had to give a nod to someone, I would say Roger, the military escort was probably the most interesting character but that is really not saying much.<br /><br />I would have to recommend to pass on this movie, despite the box-cover looking pretty good (It's what originally drew me to the movie).

{"value":"Why else would he do this to me?<br /><br />Not that I expect Dean Cain to produce hit movies. Or even decent movies. I saw Lois and Clark, I am aware of just how... \"good\" Dean Cain is.<br /><br />Obviously this is gonna be a cheesey flick, and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head. I will not call these spoilers as you can't really spoil this movie any more than it already is.<br /><br />To begin with... why is that a fake helicopter? I mean... why?<br /><br />How come that one scientist is from Chicago and that other scientist is from LA and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried? How hard would it have been to get either an american actor, or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people aren't american?<br /><br />Why are there 2 occasions when the movie gives us a slug line? We get helipad-day and then mess hall-day later on. And then that's it, who cares about the timeline. To be honest, who cared about it even when they mentioned it, but I guess that's beside the point.<br /><br />Does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens? The answer is no.<br /><br />That dragon sure can walk down that hall..over..and over...and over....and over...<br /><br />Who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history? It was straight out of scooby doo. Oh, the dragon's dead now...say, wanna get dinner? Sure, but not at some Chinese place....with Dragon in the name!! AH HA HA HA!! HA HA HA!! HAHA HA! I used to be Superman! AHA HA HA!

{"value":"A BDSM \"sub-culture\" of Los Angeles serves as backdrop for this low budget and shabbily constructed mess, plainly a vanity piece for its top-billed player, Celia Xavier, who also produces and scripts while performing a dual role as twin sisters Vanessa and Celia. A question soon develops as to whether or not some rather immoderate camera, lighting and editing pyrotechnics can ever reach a point of connection to a weak and often incoherent narrative that will not be taken seriously by a sensate viewer. Celia is employed as a highly motivated probation officer for the County of Los Angeles, while her evil natured twin has become an iconic figure within her fetishistic world largely because of erotic performances upon CD-ROMS, but when disaster befalls \"Mistress Vanessa\", virtuous Celia, determined to unearth her sister's vicious attacker, begins a new job as a \"sex slave\" at the private Castle Club where the specialty of the house is a \"dungeon party\". Two FBI field agents (whose deployment to the Vanessa case is ostensibly required due to her involvement with internet BDSM sites), in addition to a Los Angeles Police Department homicide detective, are assigned to investigate the crime, while endeavouring to provide security for Celia whose enthusiastic performance in her new vocation is avidly enough regarded by her customers as to have created conditions of personal danger for her. Flaws in logic and continuity abound, such as a homicide being allocated to L.A.P.D.'s Operations-South Bureau, a region of the metropolis that is far removed from the setting of the film. Direction is unfocused and not aided by erratic post-production editing and sound reproduction. The mentioned photographic gymnastics culminate with a batty montage near the movie's end of prior footage that is but tangentially referent to the scenario. One solid acting turn appears among this slag: Stan Abe as a zealous FBI

{"value":"Randolph Scott is leaving the USA for the greener pastures of Canada's British Columbia. He wants to start a cattle ranch there with partner Bill Williams and cook Lee Tung Foo. They stampede their small herd over a toll bridge erected by Victor Jory. Later Jory rustles their cattle and Williams loses his left arm during the fracas.<br /><br />From 1945 until 1962 when he retired, Randolph Scott made a series of good adult themed westerns, some of them considered real classics. Unfortunately the Cariboo Trail will never be listed among his best westerns. <br /><br />It's more like the material that Roy Rogers or Gene Autry might use. The story is downright silly at times. Williams who was along for the ride with Scott, he wanted to go prospect for gold as there was a big strike at the time. He doesn't blame the rustlers, he blames Scott for convincing him to make the trip for the loss of his arm. <br /><br />Also there's a scene in the film when Scott, Lee Tung Foo, and Gabby Hayes are captured by Indians. They escape because Gabby's mule has been taught to kick on command and he kicks away at the Indians allowing our heroes to escape. I'm not sure that would have played in a Rogers film.<br /><br />Furthermore the story actually wants you to believe that tyro prospector Randolph Scott accidentally stumbles on a gold strike after just a few lessons from prospector Gabby Hayes on how to find gold. <br /><br />This was Gabby Hayes's farewell feature film part. It would have been better had he gone out in a good western and in fact he had done a couple of better ones with Randolph Scott before this.<br /><br />I will say this, though no Caribou made any

{"value":"As a horror-movie fan I try to watch all significant novelties of this genre, especially those which are the products of my native cinema. And I can say that that the \"Power of Fear\" (or \"Vedma\" as the Russian title of it) is one of the weakest film among them. Firstly, it can't scary even a little kid, it paces so slowly and so predictable that there is no place for the real horror. Frankly speaking, it's bad in all points: from the goofy plot (I don't know why the Russian producers/director decided to transform the classic story about Ukrainian witchcraft into some lame and ridiculous modern-day-America thriller. I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer  it doesn't thrill a bit) and to the terrible and cheesy actors' work. All actors including the leading Valeri Nikolayev and Yevgeniya Kryukova who are quite famous in Russia look like wooden dolls or something like that and it seems to me they didn't even bother to play at all, only spoke their English lines without any expression. And at the end I don't really understand why they filmed this flick in English with Russian actors? I think it was their wrong turn. At least they could cast some American or English actors for the leading parts to make them look more convincing. The same I can say about so called \"small American town backgrounds\" which were shot in Estonia and look like it. The only positive moment I found in the \"Power of Fear\" is the visual effects. They are not excellent but rather good for the Russian film. And the music is OK, at least it doesn't irritate me. That's why I give it two stars. Overall, if you want to see good horror film  don't waste your time and money on this boring flick. And if you are looking for something that claims to be a Russian horror I'd advise you to find a copy of \"Viy or The Spirit of Evil\". It's really the terrific movie based on the same novel as \"Power of Fear\" but much, much better.","finished_norm":["a","a","horrormovi","fan","i","try","to","watch","all","signific","novelti","of","thi","genr","especi","that","which","be","the","product","of","my","nativ","cinema","and","i","can","sai","that","that","the","power","of","fear","or","vedma","a","the","russian","titl","of","it","be","on","of","the","weak","film","among","them","firstli","it","ca","not","scari","even","a","littl","kid","it","pace","so","slowli","and","so","predict","that","there","be","no","place","for","the","real","horror","frankli","speak","it","bad","in","all","point","from","the","goofi","plot","i","do","not","know","why","the","russian","producersdirector","decid","to","transform","the","classic","stori","about","ukrainian","witchcraft","into","some","lame","and","ridicul","moderndayamerica","thriller","i","absolut","agre","with","the","previou","review","it","doe","not","thrill","a","bite","and","to","the","terribl","and","cheesi","actor","work","all","actor","includ","the","lead","valeri","nikolayev","and","yevgeniya","kryukova","who","be","quit","famou","in","russia","look","like","wooden","doll","or","someth","like","that","and","it","seem","to","me","thei","do","not","even","bother","to","plai","at","all","onli","speak","their","english","line","without","ani","express","and","at","the","end","i","do","not","realli","understand","why","thei","film","thi","flick","in","english","with","russian","actor","i","think","it","be","their","wrong","turn","at","littl","thei","can","cast","some","american","or","english","actor","for","the","lead","part","to","make","them","look","much","convinc","the","same","i","can","sai","about","so","call","small","american","town","background","which","be","shoot","in","estonia","and","look","like","it","the","onli","posit","moment","i","find","in","the","power","of","fear","be","the","visual","effect","thei","be","not","excel","but","rather","good","for","the","russian","film","and","the","music","be","okai","at","littl","it","doe","not","irrit","me","that","why","i","give","it","two","star","overal","if","you","want","to","see","good","horror","film","do","not","wast","your","time","and","monei","on","thi","bore","flick","and","if","you","be","look","for","someth","that","claim","to","be","a","russian","horror","i","have","advis","you","to","find","a","copi","of","vii","or","the","spirit","of","evil","it","realli","the","terrif","movi","base","on","the","same","novel","a","power","of","fear","but","much","much","well"],"filtered":["horrormovi","fan","try","watch","signific","novelti","thi","genr","especi","product","nativ","cinema","sai","power","fear","vedma","russian","titl","weak","film","among","firstli","ca","scari","even","littl","kid","pace","slowli","predict","place","real","horror","frankli","speak","bad","point","goofi","plot","know","russian","producersdirector","decid","transform","classic","stori","ukrainian","witchcraft","lame","ridicul","moderndayamerica","thriller","absolut","agre","previou","review","doe","thrill","bite","terribl","cheesi","actor","work","actor","includ","lead","valeri","nikolayev","yevgeniya","kryukova","quit","famou","russia","look","like","wooden","doll","someth","like","seem","thei","even","bother","plai","onli","speak","english","line","without","ani","express","end","realli","understand","thei","film","thi","flick","english","russian","actor","think","wrong","turn","littl","thei","cast","american","english","actor","lead","part","make","look","much","convinc","sai","call","small","american","town","background","shoot","estonia","look","like","onli","posit","moment","find","power","fear","visual","effect","thei","excel","rather","good","russian","film","music","okai","littl","doe","irrit","give","two","star","overal","want","see","good","horror","film","wast","time","monei","thi","bore","flick","look","someth","claim","russian","horror","advis","find","copi","vii","spirit","evil","realli","terrif","movi","base","novel","power","fear","much","much","well"],"filtered2":["horrormovi","fan","try","watch","signific","novelti","genr","especi","product","nativ","cinema","power","fear","vedma","russian","titl","weak","among","firstli","ca","scari","even","littl","kid","pace","slowli","predict","place","real","horror","frankli","speak","bad","point","goofi","plot","know","russian","producersdirector","decid","transform","classic","stori","ukrainian","witchcraft","lame","ridicul","moderndayamerica","thriller","absolut","agre","previou","review","doe","thrill","bite","terribl","cheesi","actor","work","actor","includ","lead","valeri","nikolayev","yevgeniya","kryukova","quit","famou","russia","look","like","wooden","doll","someth","like","seem","even","bother","plai","onli","speak","english","line","without","ani","express","end","realli","understand","flick","english","russian","actor","think","wrong","turn","littl","cast","american","english","actor","lead","part","make","look","convinc","call","small","american","town","background","shoot","eston

{"value":"I am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many, but this was simply not a very good attempt. Its got nothing to do with comparisons with the British original -- have not seen, and doubt I will. It has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead (Jimmy Fallon).<br /><br />Fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that. He's supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach. The character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that I have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like John Cusack or Adam Sandler might have been able to give it a shot. Not Fallon, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but appears to think he is both. Not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe Fallon in his role, or believe that there is any way these two people should, or would be together. Near the end of the movie there is a scene where Barrymore (who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance) tells Fallon that its over, too much has happened, and she's moving on. And rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for Fallon, you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago. But of course the plot mechanics won't allow that to be the end of it (an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions. Its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying, but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else.","finished_norm":["i","be","gener","much","will","to","be","open","mind","about","rom","com","than","mani","but","thi","be","simpli","not","a","veri","good","attempt","it","get","noth","to","do","with","comparison","with","the","british","origin","have","not","see","and","doubt","i","will","it","have","a","whole","lot","to","do","with","a","meander","plot","lack","of","chemistri","between","the","lead","and","a","godaw","performancecharact","from","it","suppos","male","lead","jimmi","fallonbr","br","fallon","walk","onto","the","screen","wear","the","cloth","and","hairdo","of","a","year","old","and","act","a","decad","young","than","that","he","suppos","to","be","a","teacher","you","see","and","of","cours","it","good","know","that","school","district","the","world","over","love","to","hire","individu","littl","matur","than","the","child","thei","purport","to","teach","the","charact","be","so","extrem","disturb","and","irrat","that","i","have","my","doubt","whether","ani","actor","can","have","make","him","likabl","but","old","reliabl","like","john","cusack","or","adam","sandler","mai","have","be","abl","to","give","it","a","shoot","not","fallon","who","be","neither","funni","nor","a","actor","but","appear","to","think","he","be","both","not","onc","in","the","entir","cours","of","the","movi","do","you","either","believ","fallon","in","hi","role","or","believ","that","there","be","ani","wai","thi","two","peopl","should","or","would","be","togeth","near","the","end","of","the","movi","there","be","a","scene","where","barrymor","who","be","cute","a","usual","but","can","not","carri","thi","on","alon","it","hard","to","have","a","on","person","romanc","tell","fallon","that","it","over","too","much","have","happen","and","she","move","on","and","rather","than","feel","bad","about","the","scene","or","sorri","for","fallon","you","be","activ","cheer","her","on","final","she","doe","what","she","should","have","do","month","ago","but","of","cours","the","plot","mechan","wo","not","allow","that","to","be","the","end","of","it","a","end","which","actual","mai","have","make","a","statem","out","of","thi","mess","and","instead","we","get","to","see","the","ration","career","girl","throw","it","all","awai","to","chase","after","thi","childish","idiot","and","encourag","hi","delus","it","of","cours","mean","to","be","gooei","and","satisfi","but","it","actual","make","me","much","disgust","than","anyth","els"],"filtered":["gener","much","open","mind","rom","com","mani","thi","simpli","veri","good","attempt","get","noth","comparison","british","origin","see","doubt","whole","lot","meander","plot","lack","chemistri","lead","godaw","performancecharact","suppos","male","lead","jimmi","fallonbr","br","fallon","walk","onto","screen","wear","cloth","hairdo","year","old","act","decad","young","suppos","teacher","see","cours","good","know","school","district","world","love","hire","individu","littl","matur","child","thei","purport","teach","charact","extrem","disturb","irrat","doubt","whether","ani","actor","make","likabl","old","reliabl","like","john","cusack","adam","sandler","mai","abl","give","shoot","fallon","neither","funni","actor","appear","think","onc","entir","cours","movi","either","believ","fallon","hi","role","believ","ani","wai","thi","two","peopl","togeth","near","end","movi","scene","barrymor","cute","usual","carri","thi","alon","hard","person","romanc","tell","fallon","much","happen","move","rather","feel","bad","scene","sorri","fallon","activ","cheer","final","doe","month","ago","cours","plot","mechan","wo","allow","end","end","actual","mai","make","statem","thi","mess","instead","get","see","ration","career","girl","throw","awai","chase","thi","childish","idiot","encourag","hi","delus","cours","mean","gooei","satisfi","actual","make","much","disgust","anyth","els"],"filtered2":["gener","open","mind","rom","com","mani","simpli","veri","good","attempt","get","noth","comparison","british","origin","see","doubt","whole","lot","meander","plot","lack","chemistri","lead","godaw","performancecharact","suppos","male","lead","jimmi","fallonbr","fallon","walk","onto","screen","wear","cloth","hairdo","year","old","act","decad","young","suppos","teacher","see","cours","good","know","school","district","world","love","hire","individu","littl","matur","child","purport","teach","charact","extrem","disturb","irrat","doubt","whether","ani","actor","make","likabl","old","reliabl","like","john","cusack","adam","sandler","mai","abl","give","shoot","fallon","neither","funni","actor","appear","think","onc","entir","cours","either","believ","fallon","role","believ","ani","wai","two","peopl","togeth","near","end","scene","barrymor","cute","usual","carri","alon","hard","person","romanc","tell","fallon","happen","move","rather","feel","bad","scene","sorri","fallon","activ","cheer","final","doe","month","ago","cours","plot","mechan","wo","allow","end","end","actual","mai","make","statem","mess","instead","get","see","ration","career",

{"value":"\"I Love New York\" is another entry by VH-1 (MTV Networks) showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill, obnoxious, woman. It must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest, Ebonics speaking, craziest contestant - and her mother - and give them a show on this network. Many will argue, \"this is a show\". True, it's not as bad as it's previous show, \"Flavor of Love\" - but it's just as bad.<br /><br />It reminds me of a skit from the 90's show \"In Living Color\" where Keenan Ivory Wayans was imitating the boxer Mike Tyson on \"The Love Connection\" dating show and he picked \"Robin Givens\" for a date. Mike talked of how the date was okay, but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in. This show reminds me of that.<br /><br />The men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more - (I would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would NOT allow her - and her mother - to give you a name that is so ghetto, you'll embarrass yourself every time you appear on TV.) but these are professional reality actors, so why bother.<br /><br />It escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this. The fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions? 15 Minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network? (Well, you can't hate them for trying to make a buck.) Maybe the wonder is - who would want to be with this woman past an hour? Or wonder if she and her mother's next show would be on the WWF! Any way you slice it, it's a train wreck you've seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil.<br /><br />No twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck, or any different from any of the others. Appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an \"end\" to reality shows, this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end,

{"value":"What a time we live in when someone like this Joe Swan-whatever the hell is considered a good filmmaker...or even a filmmaker at all! Where are the new crop of filmmakers with brains AND talent??? We need them bad, and to hell with mumblecore!<br /><br />This movie is about nothing, just as the characters in the film stand for nothing. It's this horrible, so-called Gen Y, that is full of bored idiots, some of which declare themselves filmmakers with out bothering to learn anything about the craft before shooting. Well, Orson Welles was a filmmaker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker, etc. Current films like these show just how stupid young, so-called \"filmmakers\" can be when they believe going out with no script, no direction, no thought, no legit \"camerawork\" (everything shot horribly on DV), no craft of editing, no nothing, stands for \"rebellious\" or \"advanced\" film-making. Nope, it's called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation of cinema (and there actually is an in-your-face \"jack-off shot,\" so be ready). <br /><br />Look at the early films of any accomplished \"indie\" filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee, or Herzog...none made anything as tedious and aimless as this, yet Swan-whatever the hell, is still going to SXSW every year and hailed as some kind of gutsy, new talent. It's crap! I can't imagine anyone liking this, and everything else this so-called filmmaker has done (all seen by me) is just as bad (the newer stuff clearly made to appeal to a more mainstream audience, one of the sitcom calling). Steer clear, unless you're a friend or family member of those involved...on second thought, if you're a family member or friend you'd probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations...<br /><br />Utter garbage.

{"value":"I saw this film at its premier at Sundance 09.<br /><br />Since American Beauty is a movie that had something to say, I had hopes for Towelhead. Unfortunately, it was a disappointment. In fact, of countless movies I've seen in almost a dozen Sundance festivals, Towelhead is the only Sundance movie I've ever wanted to walk out early from.<br /><br />The worst problem with Towelhead is that it so obviously originates with a collection of \"provocative\" concepts concerning cultural stereotypes, rather than with an organic human drama. The screenplay derives from the novel of the same name by Alicia Erian. The famous Edith Wharton quote comes to mind: I have never known a novel that was good enough to be good in spite of its being adapted to the author's political views. That observation is especially devastating for Towelhead because its political views are so stale and simplistic. If there ever was a time when Towelhead's white male villains, condescending portrayals of blacks, ironic treatments of foreign cultures, etc., were fresh, it's long past.<br /><br />For a more detailed review, please look up any of the many professional reviews available online. Almost all rate this movie poorly and expose the shallow and manipulative tissue it is based on.<br /><br />On the other hand, the amateur reviewers seem more easily bamboozled. As you read through the reviews in this and similar sites, you'll frequently come across superlatives: \"stunning,\" \"breathtaking,\" \"profound,\" \"shocking,\" ... It embarrasses me to read them, but it does not surprise me. Indeed, I've encountered many people who seem to regard any book or movie dealing with racial, cultural, gender, or sexual issues as deeply moving, thought provoking, full of profound insight.

{"value":"A Nightmare on Elm Street: The Dream Child<br /><br />This is a bad movie. There's no escaping it. I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies. But even being a fan I can't help but see this movie is mediocre.<br /><br />There's not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. By now they had just given up. They don't even try. They are the production of course, hoping for a few more easy dollars.<br /><br />The story doesn't grab your attention. Its so simple it's almost absent.<br /><br />Alice, a survivor from part 4 is now pregnant. Freddy is coming back through the baby's dreams. At the beginning we learn that to stop him Alice must find his mother. And that's it. <br /><br />The story advances slowly since there's so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting. In fact that's the only scary thing, the acting, since the deaths are not even slightly cool. <br /><br />The characters are so uninteresting we couldn't care less for them.<br /><br />The girls are as unattractive as possible. The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group. I've seen better actors in school plays. It's embarrassing really.<br /><br />Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some class to this. She is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. But the material just didn't let her shine. What a pity.<br /><br />Stephen Hopkins work is nowhere close to Renny Harlin´s brilliant direction in Dream Master. He tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension Harlin and Craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be found.<br /><br />The Dream Child is just another unimaginative sequel. It's the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name. <br /><br />The end for the once scary Freddy. It's too sad to see him now. A clown that's not funny. A bad joke.

{"value":"I have to say I was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films. I have no idea why but I trusted Sexo, Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non-existent industry. Maybe it was because the soundtrack(which I listened to before I saw the film) sounded different from others, maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces(apart from Demian Bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors) and supposedly dealed within it's script with modern social behaviour, maybe because it's photography I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical. The film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser, and a major letdown. What Serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned \"battle of the sexes\" as in \"all men are the same\" and \"why is it that all women...;\" blah,blah,blah. Nothing new in it, not even that, it uses so much common ground and clichè that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female/male condition. Full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clichès I talked about before(those always work, always) and screaming performances(it is a well acted film in it's context)..and by screaming I mean, literally. The at first more compelling characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turn out to be according to Serrano the more pathetic ones. I completely disagree with Serrano, they shouldn't have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come through...he made sure we got HIS message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood. Anyway, it is after all, a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it (if you accept to be manipulated by it).","finished_norm":["i","have","to","sai","i","be","realli","look","forward","on","watch","thi","film","and","find","some","new","life","in","it","that","would","separ","it","from","much","dull","and","overli","craft","mexican","film","i","have","no","idea","why","but","i","trust","sexo","pudor","y","lagrima","to","be","the","on","to","inject","fresh","and","confid","to","our","nonexist","industri","mayb","it","be","becaus","the","soundtrackwhich","i","listen","to","befor","i","see","the","film","sound","differ","from","other","mayb","it","be","becaus","it","dare","to","includ","new","facesapart","from","demian","bichir","who","be","alwai","a","favorit","of","mexican","film","director","and","supposedli","deal","within","it","script","with","modern","social","behaviour","mayb","becaus","it","photographi","i","see","in","the","trailer","be","bright","and","realist","instead","of","theatric","the","film","turn","out","to","be","a","major","crowd","pleaser","and","a","major","letdown","what","serrano","actual","deal","here","with","be","the","veri","old","fashion","battl","of","the","sex","a","in","all","man","be","the","same","and","why","be","it","that","all","woman","blahblahblah","noth","new","in","it","not","even","that","it","us","so","much","common","grind","and","clichè","that","it","eventu","mock","itself","without","leav","ani","valuabl","reflexion","on","the","femalemal","condit","full","of","usual","tramp","on","the","audienc","like","safe","gag","about","the","clichè","i","talk","about","beforethos","alwai","work","alwai","and","scream","performancesit","be","a","good","act","film","in","it","contextand","by","scream","i","mean","liter","the","at","much","compel","charact","plai","by","monica","dionn","and","demian","bichir","turn","out","to","be","accord","to","serrano","the","much","pathet","on","i","complet","disagre","with","serrano","thei","should","not","have","be","treat","that","wai","onli","to","serv","a","marionett","for","hi","lesson","to","come","throughh","make","sure","we","get","hi","messag","and","complet","destroi","their","role","that","be","the","onli","solid","grind","in","which","thi","stori","can","have","stand","anywai","it","be","after","all","a","veri","entertain","film","at","time","and","you","will","probabl","have","a","good","time","see","it","if","you","accept","to","be","manipul","by","it"],"filtered":["sai","realli","look","forward","watch","thi","film","find","new","life","separ","much","dull","overli","craft","mexican","film","idea","trust","sexo","pudor","y","lagrima","inject","fresh","confid","nonexist","industri","mayb","becaus","soundtrackwhich","listen","befor","see","film","sound","differ","mayb","becaus","dare","includ","new","facesapart","demian","bichir","alwai","favorit","mexican","film","director","supposedli","deal","within","script","modern","social","behaviour","mayb","becaus","photographi","see","trailer","bright","realist","instead","theatric","film","turn","major","crowd","pleaser","major","letdown","serrano","actual","deal","veri","old","fashion","battl","sex","man","woman","blahblahblah","noth","new","even","us","much","common","grind","clichè","eventu","mock","without","leav","ani","valuabl","reflexion","femalemal","condit","full","usual","tramp","audienc","like","safe","gag","clichè","talk","beforethos","alwai","work","alwai","scream","performancesit","good","act","film","contextand","scream","mean","liter","much","compel","charact","plai","monica","dionn","demian","bichir","turn","accord","serrano","much","pathet","complet","disagre","serrano","thei","treat","wai","onli","serv","marionett","hi","lesson","come","throughh","make","sure","get","hi","messag","complet","destroi","role","onli","solid","grind","thi","stori","stand","anywai","veri","entertain","film","time","probabl","good","time","see","accept","manipul"],"filtered2":["realli","look","forward","watch","find","new","life","separ","dull","overli","craft","mexican","idea","trust","sexo","pudor","y","lagrima","inject","fresh","confid","nonexist","industri","mayb","becaus","soundtrackwhich","listen","befor","see","sound","differ","mayb","becaus","dare","includ","new","facesapart","demian","bichir","alwai","favorit","mexican","director","supposedli","deal","within","script","modern","social","behaviour","mayb","becaus","photographi","see","trailer","bright","realist","instead","theatric","turn","major","crowd","pleaser","major","letdown","serrano","actual","deal","veri","old","fashion","battl","sex","man","woman","blahblahblah","noth","new","even","us","common","grind","clichè","eventu","mock","without","leav","ani","valuabl","reflexion","femalemal","condit","full","usual","tramp","audienc","like","safe","gag","clichè","talk","beforethos","alwai","work","alwai","scream","performancesit","good","act","contextand","scream","mean","liter","compel","charact","plai","monica","dionn","demian","bichir","turn","accord","serrano","pathet","complet","disagre","serrano","treat","wai","onli","serv

{"value":"A young scientist Harry Harrison is continuing his late father's scientific research into limb regeneration with flying colours, but his interferingly dominate mother and her doctor lover want to sell off the serum. When he finds out, there is an accident involving Harry losing an arm. So, he tries out the serum and what eventuates is a genetically deranged arm that has a mind of its own.<br /><br />Oh we've seen this oh so many times before, but what lifts this very campy and quite rubbery shonky junk is the performance of movie icons Elke Sommer and Oliver Reed. Actually it's not a bad flick by Fangoria films; just there are better ones out there, which are similar in vein. \"Servered Ties\" simply lacks it own distinctive style. The oddball nature and unpleasant splatter resembled \"Re-animator\" and even a touch of slapstick stuck out like something from \"Evil Dead 2\".<br /><br />The comic story is truly whacked out with it's black humour, but it can get melodramatic and a bit in dry in the fun factor. Surprises do crop up, especially the flick's final outcome. Which is well accepted, as I thought it could have copped out with something more accessible. For a low-budget production the FX makeup can look rigid and very goofy, but there's some grotesque moments that will make you smile than actually cringe. Even a brush of sexual tension streamlines the story, thanks to Elke Sommer's sternly juicy performance as the mother. Oliver Reed is quite humorously deadpan in a wicked sense and he pulls it off extremely well. They were both immensely diverting as the couple you loved to hate. Billy Morrisette is delightful in a erratic performance as Harry. Director Damon Santostefano briskly paces the film and orchestrates some stylish scenes of gripping and bamboozling horror.<br /><br />Yeah it's juvenile and basically silly nonsense, but you got to hand it to it for some undemanding

{"value":"SWING! is an important film because it's one of the remaining Black-produced and acted films from the 1930s. Many of these films have simply deteriorated so badly that they are unwatchable, but this one is in fairly good shape. It's also a nice chance to see many of the talented Black performers of the period just after the heyday of the old Cotton Club--a time all but forgotten today.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the film is historically important and has some lovely performances, it's also a mess. The main plot is very similar to the Hollywood musicals of the era--including a prima donna who is going to ruin the show and the surprise unknown who appears from no where to save the day. However, the writing is just god-awful and a bit trashy at times--and projects images of Black America that some might find a bit demeaning. This is because before the plot really gets going, you are treated to a no-account bum who lives off his hard working wife (a popular stereotype of the time) and when he is caught with a hussy (who, by the way, totally overplays this role), they have a fight which looks like a scene from WWE Smackdown! And, the one lady wants to cut the other lady with a straight razor--a trashy scene indeed! Later in the film, when the prima donna is behaving abominably, her husband punches her in the face and everyone applauds him! It seems like the film, at times, wants to appeal to the lowest common denominator in the audience PLUS they can't even do this well--with some of the worst acting I've seen in a very long time.<br /><br />Still, if you can look past a lousy production in just about every way (with trashy characters, bad acting and direction and poor writing), this one might be worth a peek so you can see excellent singing and tap dancing--as well as to catch a glimpse of forgotten Black culture. Just don't say I didn't warn you about the acting--it's really, really bad!","finished_norm":["swing","be","a","import","film","becaus","it","on","of","the","remain","blackproduc","and","act","film","from","the","mani","of","thi","film","have","simpli","deterior","so","badli","that","thei","be","unwatch","but","thi","on","be","in","fairli","good","shape","it","conjur","a","nice","chanc","to","see","mani","of","the","talent","black","perform","of","the","period","just","after","the","heydai","of","the","old","cotton","cluba","time","all","but","forget","todaybr","br","unfortun","while","the","film","be","histor","import","and","have","some","love","perform","it","conjur","a","mess","the","main","plot","be","veri","similar","to","the","hollywood","music","of","the","erainclud","a","prima","donna","who","be","go","to","ruin","the","show","and","the","surpris","unknown","who","appear","from","no","where","to","save","the","dai","howev","the","write","be","just","godaw","and","a","bite","trashi","at","timesand","project","imag","of","black","america","that","some","mai","find","a","bite","demean","thi","be","becaus","befor","the","plot","realli","get","go","you","be","treat","to","a","noaccount","bum","who","live","off","hi","hard","work","wife","a","popular","stereotyp","of","the","time","and","when","he","be","catch","with","a","hussi","who","by","the","wai","total","overplai","thi","role","thei","have","a","fight","which","look","like","a","scene","from","wwe","smackdown","and","the","on","ladi","want","to","cut","the","other","ladi","with","a","straight","razora","trashi","scene","ind","late","in","the","film","when","the","prima","donna","be","behav","abomin","her","husband","punch","her","in","the","face","and","everyon","applaud","him","it","seem","like","the","film","at","time","want","to","appeal","to","the","low","common","denomin","in","the","audienc","plu","thei","ca","not","even","do","thi","wellwith","some","of","the","wrong","act","i","have","see","in","a","veri","long","timebr","br","still","if","you","can","look","past","a","lousi","product","in","just","about","everi","wai","with","trashi","charact","bad","act","and","direct","and","poor","write","thi","on","mai","be","worth","a","peek","so","you","can","see","excel","sing","and","tap","dancinga","good","a","to","catch","a","glimps","of","forget","black","cultur","just","do","not","sai","i","do","not","warn","you","about","the","actingit","realli","realli","bad"],"filtered":["swing","import","film","becaus","remain","blackproduc","act","film","mani","thi","film","simpli","deterior","badli","thei","unwatch","thi","fairli","good","shape","conjur","nice","chanc","see","mani","talent","black","perform","period","heydai","old","cotton","cluba","time","forget","todaybr","br","unfortun","film","histor","import","love","perform","conjur","mess","main","plot","veri","similar","hollywood","music","erainclud","prima","donna","go","ruin","show","surpris","unknown","appear","save","dai","howev","write","godaw","bite","trashi","timesand","project","imag","black","america","mai","find","bite","demean","thi","becaus","befor","plot","realli","get","go","treat","noaccount","bum","live","hi","hard","work","wife","popular","stereotyp","time","catch","hussi","wai","total","overplai","thi","role","thei","fight","look","like","scene","wwe","smackdown","ladi","want","cut","ladi","straight","razora","trashi","scene","ind","late","film","prima","donna","behav","abomin","husband","punch","face","everyon","applaud","seem","like","film","time","want","appeal","low","common","denomin","audienc","plu","thei","ca","even","thi","wellwith","wrong","act","see","veri","long","timebr","br","still","look","past","lousi","product","everi","wai","trashi","charact","bad","act","direct","poor","write","thi","mai","worth","peek","see","excel","sing","tap","dancinga","good","catch","glimps","forget","black","cultur","sai","warn","actingit","realli","realli","bad"],"filtered2":["swing","import","becaus","remain","blackproduc","act","mani","simpli","deterior","badli","unwatch","fairli","good","shape","conjur","nice","chanc","see","mani","talent","black","perform","period","heydai","old","cotton","cluba","time","forget","todaybr","unfortun","histor","import","love","perform","conjur","mess","main","plot","veri","similar","hollywood","music","erainclud","prima","donna","go","ruin","show","surpris","unknown","appear","save","dai","howev","write","godaw","bite","trashi","timesand","project","imag","black","america","mai","find","bite","demean","becaus","befor","plot","realli","get","go","treat","noaccount","bum","live","hard","work","wife","popular","stereotyp","time","catch","hussi","wai","total","overplai","role","fight","look","like","scene","wwe","smackdown","ladi","want","cut","ladi","straight","razora","trashi","scene","ind","late","prima","donna","behav","abomin","husband","punch","face","everyon","applaud","seem","like","time","want","appeal","low","common","denomin","audienc","plu","ca","even","wellwith","wrong","act","see","veri","long","timebr","still"

{"value":"VILLA RIDES (1968) turns out to be something of a big disappointment! And even though Sam Peckinpah had a hand in the screenplay, along with Robert Towne, it still emerges as a leadenly written movie dryly directed by the undistinguished Buzz Kulik. Firstly, top billed Yul Brynner as Pancho Villa is wrong for the part! He's not charismatic enough to play the great Mexican revolutionary! His one note performance lacks the fire and gusto Anthony Quinn or Gilbert Roland could have brought to the role. Brynner simply looks like a Russian aristocrat dressed up like a Mexican bandit who is in the middle of the Mexican revolution instead of the Russian one. Also, second billed Robert Mitchum is totally wasted in the picture! His part as a biplane flying ace lobbing home-made bombs from the air in the cause of the revolution is a poorly written meager role that could have been played by any minor star. Mitch hasn't a decent line in the entire movie and brings to one's mind his other Mexican revolution picture the far superior \"Bandido\" (1956) which unfortunately nobody seems to have any interest in releasing on DVD. Besides lacking any kind of style \"Villa Rides\" also suffers badly without the presence of a female star! There is starlet Grazia Buccella as a young Mexican girl who gives Mitchum the glad eye but her casting is merely perfunctory. Someone like Claudia Cardinale or Jean Peters could have perhaps added a couple of badly needed notches to the faltering story line.<br /><br />There are a couple of good action scenes in the movie but a couple of good action scenes do not a movie make and the less than perfect Panavision picture quality plus the over repetitive Maurice Jarre theme tune doesn't help matters.<br /><br />As is Paramount's wont there are no extras - not even a trailer! Yup, a disappointing movie and DVD presentation that could have been and should have been a whole lot better.","finished_norm":["villa","ride","turn","out","to","be","someth","of","a","big","disappoint","and","even","though","sam","peckinpah","have","a","hand","in","the","screenplai","along","with","robert","town","it","still","emerg","a","a","leadenli","write","movi","dryli","direct","by","the","undistinguish","buzz","kulik","firstli","top","bill","yul","brynner","a","pancho","villa","be","wrong","for","the","part","he","not","charismat","enough","to","plai","the","great","mexican","revolutionari","hi","on","note","perform","lack","the","fire","and","gusto","anthoni","quinn","or","gilbert","roland","can","have","bring","to","the","role","brynner","simpli","look","like","a","russian","aristocrat","dress","up","like","a","mexican","bandit","who","be","in","the","middl","of","the","mexican","revolut","instead","of","the","russian","on","conjur","bill","robert","mitchum","be","total","wast","in","the","pictur","hi","part","a","a","biplan","fly","ac","lob","homemad","bomb","from","the","air","in","the","caus","of","the","revolut","be","a","poorli","write","meager","role","that","can","have","be","plai","by","ani","minor","star","mitch","have","not","a","decent","line","in","the","entir","movi","and","bring","to","on","mind","hi","other","mexican","revolut","pictur","the","far","superior","bandido","which","unfortun","nobodi","seem","to","have","ani","interest","in","releas","on","dvd","besid","lack","ani","kind","of","styl","villa","ride","conjur","suffer","badli","without","the","presenc","of","a","femal","star","there","be","starlet","grazia","buccella","a","a","young","mexican","girl","who","give","mitchum","the","glad","ey","but","her","cast","be","mere","perfunctori","someon","like","claudia","cardinal","or","jean","peter","can","have","perhap","add","a","coupl","of","badli","ne","notch","to","the","falter","stori","linebr","br","there","be","a","coupl","of","good","action","scene","in","the","movi","but","a","coupl","of","good","action","scene","do","not","a","movi","make","and","the","littl","than","perfect","panavis","pictur","qualiti","plu","the","over","repetit","mauric","jarr","theme","tune","doe","not","help","mattersbr","br","a","be","paramount","wont","there","be","no","extra","not","even","a","trailer","yup","a","disappoint","movi","and","dvd","present","that","can","have","be","and","should","have","be","a","whole","lot","well"],"filtered":["villa","ride","turn","someth","big","disappoint","even","though","sam","peckinpah","hand","screenplai","along","robert","town","still","emerg","leadenli","write","movi","dryli","direct","undistinguish","buzz","kulik","firstli","top","bill","yul","brynner","pancho","villa","wrong","part","charismat","enough","plai","great","mexican","revolutionari","hi","note","perform","lack","fire","gusto","anthoni","quinn","gilbert","roland","bring","role","brynner","simpli","look","like","russian","aristocrat","dress","like","mexican","bandit","middl","mexican","revolut","instead","russian","conjur","bill","robert","mitchum","total","wast","pictur","hi","part","biplan","fly","ac","lob","homemad","bomb","air","caus","revolut","poorli","write","meager","role","plai","ani","minor","star","mitch","decent","line","entir","movi","bring","mind","hi","mexican","revolut","pictur","far","superior","bandido","unfortun","nobodi","seem","ani","interest","releas","dvd","besid","lack","ani","kind","styl","villa","ride","conjur","suffer","badli","without","presenc","femal","star","starlet","grazia","buccella","young","mexican","girl","give","mitchum","glad","ey","cast","mere","perfunctori","someon","like","claudia","cardinal","jean","peter","perhap","add","coupl","badli","ne","notch","falter","stori","linebr","br","coupl","good","action","scene","movi","coupl","good","action","scene","movi","make","littl","perfect","panavis","pictur","qualiti","plu","repetit","mauric","jarr","theme","tune","doe","help","mattersbr","br","paramount","wont","extra","even","trailer","yup","disappoint","movi","dvd","present","whole","lot","well"],"filtered2":["villa","ride","turn","someth","big","disappoint","even","though","sam","peckinpah","hand","screenplai","along","robert","town","still","emerg","leadenli","write","dryli","direct","undistinguish","buzz","kulik","firstli","top","bill","yul","brynner","pancho","villa","wrong","part","charismat","enough","plai","great","mexican","revolutionari","note","perform","lack","fire","gusto","anthoni","quinn","gilbert","roland","bring","role","brynner","simpli","look","like","russian","aristocrat","dress","like","mexican","bandit","middl","mexican","revolut","instead","russian","conjur","bill","robert","mitchum","total","wast","pictur","part","biplan","fly","ac","lob","homemad","bomb","air","caus","revolut","poorli","write","meager","role","plai","ani","minor","star","mitch","decent","line","entir","bring","mind","mexican","revolut","pictur","far","superior","bandido","unfortun","nobodi","seem","ani","interest","releas","dvd","besid","lack","ani","kind","styl","vill

{"value":"SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER is another example of what happens when you get a bunch of untalented people together to make an \"extreme\" horror film. Any sort of acting, production, storyline, FX, etc...go out the window in an effort to create \"shock-value\". Now don't get me wrong - I consider myself a connoisseur of \"shock\" films, and the sleazier/gorier/nastier the better - but it's still nice to see SOME sort of talent from SOMEONE involved in the film.<br /><br />SCHIZOPHRENIAC chronicles the life of Harry Russo - a drug-addicted freak-show who takes orders to kill from his ventriloquist's dummy, Rubberneck. He goes on a few sprees killing hookers and other random people, and screaming about how much he hates \"hoo-uhs\" (that's \"whores\" for those of you that don't speak New York-ese...) and how he wants to rape them in the ass. There are a few weak necrophilia scenes, very little gore, and some nudity to mix things up a bit - but nothing that you haven't seen in a better film...<br /><br />The only redeeming thing that I can find in this retarded film are the often (unintentionally?) hilarious screaming-fits from our main man, Harry. He goes on-and-on-and-on about wanting to kill everyone and do them in the ass, and it really becomes quite comical after a while. In fact, I'm almost tempted to believe that there's supposed to be some sort of homo-erotic undertone to this film, with all the ass talk and constant shots of Harry running around with his dong hangin' out. In all honesty, that joker is nekkid more in this film then the few chicks that show some T-and-A (and some full-frontal, for good measure). SCHIZOPHRENIAC is mildly amusing as a 1-time watch, but I can really only recommend this to those that want to be able to say that they watched a film called SCHIZOPHRENIAC: THE WHORE MANGLER.

{"value":"This film is an attempt to present Jared Diamonds theory of \"Guns, Germs and Steel\", explaining how Europeans have dominated much of the globe.<br /><br />The version I saw of this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours. I think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes. There are completely useless scenes of: Professor Jared Diamond watching birds through binoculars, Professor Jared Diamond failing to use a bow and arrow properly, Professor Jared Diamond firing a muzzle-loader badly. Was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of \"Professor Jared diamond?\". This part of the documentary was so bad, it could have been a spoof. The worst was when Diamond is shown breaking down and weeping when touring the malaria ward in an African hospital. None of this helps me understand his theory of \"Guns, Germs and Steel.\" BTW, \"Guns, Germs and Steel\" is said about 100 times. \"Can the Europeans guns, germs and steel get them out of this dire situation? Stay tuned and find out!\" When he finally gets down to business, his theory is equal parts interesting and utterly boring. Europeans conquered the natives peoples of other lands, because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons. Do I really need a professor to convince me of this? The parts of his theory that explain how the Europeans came to have the advantages that allow the conquest are interesting, but the coverage is paper-thin.<br /><br />In the end, I think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non-Europeans are as capable as Europeans. If I'm not a racist, I already know this. If I'm a racist, Jared Diamond is not going to convince me with his bumbling use of native implements.<br /><br />I don't think adults are the intended audience for this documentary. Kids may enjoy this more than I, though. I have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the

{"value":"SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />This is one of the worst movies ever made - it's that simple. There is not one redeeming quality about this movie. The first 10 minutes are quite tricky - they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat. Instead, you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization. The lake was ridiculous, looked like an aquarium, and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. Characters show their advanced teleportation powers, for example Alex Thomas who falls into the lake (drunk), and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position. Angie Harmon put up a pitiful performance as Kate, made worse by the space-time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader. An example of this would be when she said, \"Flashlight!\" in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half. Finally, the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that I have ever seen. It was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists. An example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on Alex's car. I would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie. The ending was absolutely pathetic. The writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say, \"oh yeah!\" Instead, we're left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line. Unfortunately, there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap.<br /><br />I give this a .5 out of 10, the .5 being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book.","finished_norm":["spoiler","aheadbr","br","thi","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","ever","make","it","that","simpl","there","be","not","on","redeem","qualiti","about","thi","movi","the","minut","be","quit","tricki","thei","actual","lead","you","to","believ","that","thi","film","will","be","shock","and","will","have","you","on","the","edg","of","your","seat","instead","you","will","spend","minut","punch","yourself","while","watch","steal","and","poorli","make","scene","run","without","ani","organ","the","lake","be","ridicul","look","like","a","aquarium","and","have","the","same","plant","in","differ","part","of","the","lake","bed","charact","show","their","advanc","teleport","power","for","exampl","alex","thoma","who","fall","into","the","lake","drink","and","then","end","up","on","hi","boat","in","a","imposs","posit","angi","harmon","put","up","a","piti","perform","a","kate","make","wrong","by","the","spacetim","continuum","ruptur","dialog","that","appear","to","have","be","write","at","the","last","minut","by","a","grader","a","exampl","of","thi","would","be","when","she","sai","flashlight","in","such","a","stupid","manner","that","it","show","the","threshold","of","how","much","a","human","bodi","can","cring","befor","it","snap","in","half","final","the","edit","of","thi","movi","be","by","far","the","much","bizarr","and","horrif","that","i","have","ever","see","it","be","like","the","cameraman","be","a","bunch","of","chimp","who","have","be","give","camcord","by","scientist","a","exampl","of","thi","would","be","when","we","suddenli","get","a","closeup","of","the","headlight","on","alex","car","i","would","bet","that","there","be","littl","to","no","time","spend","edit","thi","movi","the","end","be","absolut","pathet","the","writer","be","obvious","try","to","creat","some","sort","of","mysteri","plot","line","that","make","the","viewer","sai","oh","ye","instead","we","re","leav","to","view","some","dumb","paint","of","a","spider","that","somehow","fit","into","the","stori","line","unfortun","there","be","not","on","perspect","in","the","million","out","there","that","can","save","thi","movi","from","be","a","fester","piec","of","crapbr","br","i","give","thi","a","out","of","the","be","from","the","fact","that","thi","movi","be","record","on","film","instead","of","becom","a","pictur","book"],"filtered":["spoiler","aheadbr","br","thi","wrong","movi","ever","make","simpl","redeem","qualiti","thi","movi","minut","quit","tricki","thei","actual","lead","believ","thi","film","shock","edg","seat","instead","spend","minut","punch","watch","steal","poorli","make","scene","run","without","ani","organ","lake","ridicul","look","like","aquarium","plant","differ","part","lake","bed","charact","show","advanc","teleport","power","exampl","alex","thoma","fall","lake","drink","end","hi","boat","imposs","posit","angi","harmon","put","piti","perform","kate","make","wrong","spacetim","continuum","ruptur","dialog","appear","write","last","minut","grader","exampl","thi","sai","flashlight","stupid","manner","show","threshold","much","human","bodi","cring","befor","snap","half","final","edit","thi","movi","far","much","bizarr","horrif","ever","see","like","cameraman","bunch","chimp","give","camcord","scientist","exampl","thi","suddenli","get","closeup","headlight","alex","car","bet","littl","time","spend","edit","thi","movi","end","absolut","pathet","writer","obvious","try","creat","sort","mysteri","plot","line","make","viewer","sai","oh","ye","instead","re","leav","view","dumb","paint","spider","somehow","fit","stori","line","unfortun","perspect","million","save","thi","movi","fester","piec","crapbr","br","give","thi","fact","thi","movi","record","film","instead","becom","pictur","book"],"filtered2":["spoiler","aheadbr","wrong","ever","make","simpl","redeem","qualiti","minut","quit","tricki","actual","lead","believ","shock","edg","seat","instead","spend","minut","punch","watch","steal","poorli","make","scene","run","without","ani","organ","lake","ridicul","look","like","aquarium","plant","differ","part","lake","bed","charact","show","advanc","teleport","power","exampl","alex","thoma","fall","lake","drink","end","boat","imposs","posit","angi","harmon","put","piti","perform","kate","make","wrong","spacetim","continuum","ruptur","dialog","appear","write","last","minut","grader","exampl","flashlight","stupid","manner","show","threshold","human","bodi","cring","befor","snap","half","final","edit","far","bizarr","horrif","ever","see","like","cameraman","bunch","chimp","give","camcord","scientist","exampl","suddenli","get","closeup","headlight","alex","car","bet","littl","time","spend","edit","end","absolut","pathet","writer","obvious","try","creat","sort","mysteri","plot","line","make","viewer","oh","ye","instead","re","leav","view","dumb","paint","spider","somehow","fit","stori","line","unfortun","perspect","million","save","fester","piec","crapbr","give","fact","record","instead","becom","pictur","book"],"features":{"type"

{"value":"I bought this video at Walmart's $1 bin. I think I over-paid!!! In the 1940s, Bela Lugosi made a long string of 3rd-rate movies for small studios (in this case, Monogram--the ones who made most of the Bowry Boys films). While the wretchedness of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved (Ed Wood \"classics\" such as Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space), they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most die-hard fans.<br /><br />I am an old movie junkie, so I gave this a try. Besides, a few of these lesser films were actually pretty good--just not this one.<br /><br />Lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides. They never really explained WHY it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife had--so you can see that the plot was never really hashed out at all.<br /><br />Anyways, a really annoying female reporter (a Lois Lane type without Jimmy Olsen or Superman) wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were STOLEN! So, she follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of Lugosi. Lugosi's home is complete with his crazed wife, a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant's sons (an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf). Naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film--apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! Eventually, the maniacs ALL die--mostly due to their own hands and all is well. At the conclusion, the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry.

{"value":"About halfway through, I realized I didn't care about these characters in the least; however, I watched a bit more anyway. Regrettably, I came back the next day and finished it. I shouldn't have bothered.<br /><br />If you know *anything* about the film beforehand, you know that the lead character will be a plane crash survivor - and the title gives you a pretty good idea of what's gonna happen afterward - he's gonna get on the phone and call people about it! That was almost as bad as \"Snakes on a Plane\" (another bad aviation catastrophe flick).<br /><br />I realize this is an old film, and the acting style in those days was much less naturalistic than today. But even by those standards, the acting was embarrassing. These weren't characters, they were stereotypes. I suspect this movie was, more than anything, an attempt by Bette Davis to help her husband's (Gary Merrill) career. To no avail however - I have seen oak trees display more genuine emotion than he did.<br /><br />Davis' playing the happy cripple (i.e., a non-glamorous role) was probably looked on as an edgy and bold career move. It wasn't. It was just boring. She was a kind of Tiny Tim in the film, making Trask (Merrill's character) see the truth about love and forgiveness (although she was less winsome than Tiny Tim), calmly dispensing wisdom about life and relationships without a hint that her beloved husband had just died.<br /><br />The final scene, where Trask calls his wife back in Iowa to reconcile, was so affected and over-acted on both ends of the phone line, I almost cringed. I had to remind myself that these people actually got paid for what they were doing in this film.<br /><br />I noticed a lot of people seem to have enjoyed this movie. If you found it uplifting , that's great. But frankly, I just found it bad. There are plenty of old movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood that were far better written and

{"value":"I ended up watching The Tenants with my close friends who rented the movie solely based on Snoop Dogg's appearance (a passionate fetish of theirs) on the cover. Understandably, I did not expect much. I thought the movie would include the typical array of Snoop Dogg related behavior and imagery often seen in cliché rap videos. However, my generalization was for the most part wrong. Unfortunately, this didn't make the movie any better.<br /><br />Most would describe the movie as a dark serious drama, whereas I would describe it as a dark seriously drawn out boring drama flick. The film tells a story of two struggling writers (Dylan McDermott and Snoop Dogg) who are trying to create their own separate masterpieces. Their polar opposite lifestyles end up forming an unlikely but highly complex and neurotic friendship. This friendship moves throughout the entire movie like a wild roller-coaster - most of which is contributed by Snoop's character - reminiscent of someone with a severe case of split personality disorder. And although the movie is a drama, the acting - which has a morbid and serious tone - from Snoop and company was more comical than anything else.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie for those who are attention impaired because this one has a lot of dialogue and a lot more dialogue after that. There are some mediocre conflicts, but even they are mostly bogged down with more dialogue. The end, however, jumped at me with a sudden surprise. It was a little bit twisted, somewhat unexpected and a perfect way to wrap up a movie that needed to end. While watching the ending credits I couldn't help but picture the director thinking, \"Oh God, how the hell do I end this snoozer.\" By the way, the director laid out carefully planted hints and subtleties leading to the climax - all of which are more visible than Waldo in a crowded street of midgets wearing nothing but black sweaters.","finished_norm":["i","end","up","watch","the","tenant","with","my","close","friend","who","rent","the","movi","sole","base","on","snoop","dogg","appear","a","passion","fetish","of","their","on","the","cover","understand","i","do","not","expect","much","i","think","the","movi","would","includ","the","typic","arrai","of","snoop","dogg","relat","behavior","and","imageri","often","see","in","cliché","rap","video","howev","my","gener","be","for","the","much","part","wrong","unfortun","thi","do","not","make","the","movi","ani","betterbr","br","much","would","describ","the","movi","a","a","dark","seriou","drama","wherea","i","would","describ","it","a","a","dark","serious","draw","out","bore","drama","flick","the","film","tell","a","stori","of","two","struggl","writer","dylan","mcdermott","and","snoop","dogg","who","be","try","to","creat","their","own","separ","masterpiec","their","polar","opposit","lifestyl","end","up","form","a","unlik","but","highli","complex","and","neurot","friendship","thi","friendship","move","throughout","the","entir","movi","like","a","wild","rollercoast","much","of","which","be","contribut","by","snoop","charact","reminisc","of","someon","with","a","sever","case","of","split","person","disord","and","although","the","movi","be","a","drama","the","act","which","have","a","morbid","and","seriou","tone","from","snoop","and","compani","be","much","comic","than","anyth","elsebr","br","i","would","not","recommend","thi","movi","for","that","who","be","attent","impair","becaus","thi","on","have","a","lot","of","dialogu","and","a","lot","much","dialogu","after","that","there","be","some","mediocr","conflict","but","even","thei","be","mostli","bog","down","with","much","dialogu","the","end","howev","jump","at","me","with","a","sudden","surpris","it","be","a","littl","bite","twist","somewhat","unexpect","and","a","perfect","wai","to","wrap","up","a","movi","that","ne","to","end","while","watch","the","end","credit","i","can","not","help","but","pictur","the","director","think","oh","god","how","the","hell","do","i","end","thi","snoozer","by","the","wai","the","director","lai","out","carefulli","plant","hint","and","subtleti","lead","to","the","climax","all","of","which","be","much","visibl","than","waldo","in","a","crowd","street","of","midget","wear","noth","but","black","sweater"],"filtered":["end","watch","tenant","close","friend","rent","movi","sole","base","snoop","dogg","appear","passion","fetish","cover","understand","expect","much","think","movi","includ","typic","arrai","snoop","dogg","relat","behavior","imageri","often","see","cliché","rap","video","howev","gener","much","part","wrong","unfortun","thi","make","movi","ani","betterbr","br","much","describ","movi","dark","seriou","drama","wherea","describ","dark","serious","draw","bore","drama","flick","film","tell","stori","two","struggl","writer","dylan","mcdermott","snoop","dogg","try","creat","separ","masterpiec","polar","opposit","lifestyl","end","form","unlik","highli","complex","neurot","friendship","thi","friendship","move","throughout","entir","movi","like","wild","rollercoast","much","contribut","snoop","charact","reminisc","someon","sever","case","split","person","disord","although","movi","drama","act","morbid","seriou","tone","snoop","compani","much","comic","anyth","elsebr","br","recommend","thi","movi","attent","impair","becaus","thi","lot","dialogu","lot","much","dialogu","mediocr","conflict","even","thei","mostli","bog","much","dialogu","end","howev","jump","sudden","surpris","littl","bite","twist","somewhat","unexpect","perfect","wai","wrap","movi","ne","end","watch","end","credit","help","pictur","director","think","oh","god","hell","end","thi","snoozer","wai","director","lai","carefulli","plant","hint","subtleti","lead","climax","much","visibl","waldo","crowd","street","midget","wear","noth","black","sweater"],"filtered2":["end","watch","tenant","close","friend","rent","sole","base","snoop","dogg","appear","passion","fetish","cover","understand","expect","think","includ","typic","arrai","snoop","dogg","relat","behavior","imageri","often","see","cliché","rap","video","howev","gener","part","wrong","unfortun","make","ani","betterbr","describ","dark","seriou","drama","wherea","describ","dark","serious","draw","bore","drama","flick","tell","stori","two","struggl","writer","dylan","mcdermott","snoop","dogg","try","creat","separ","masterpiec","polar","opposit","lifestyl","end","form","unlik","highli","complex","neurot","friendship","friendship","move","throughout","entir","like","wild","rollercoast","contribut","snoop","charact","reminisc","someon","sever","case","split","person","disord","although","drama","act","morbid","seriou","tone","snoop","compani","comic","anyth","elsebr","recommend","attent","impair","becaus","lot","dialogu","lot","dialogu","mediocr","conflict","even","mostli","bog","dialogu","end","howev","jump","sudden","surpris","littl","bite","twist","somewhat","unexpect","perfect","wai","wrap","ne","end

{"value":"Made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film in the Edinburgh film festival. It was well shot from the outset, but that's the last positive comment I have about the film. The acting was awful, I wonder if actual gogo girls were hired? But it was the plot that was truly laughable, in fact that it was laughable and not boring is the only reason I gave this 3/10.<br /><br />** Spoilers below **.<br /><br />I just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience laughing:.<br /><br />Shoving the girl in the field: who would have thought that a kid shoving another kid could be acted so badly. A real eye-opener.<br /><br />The getting on the bus scene: the girl is getting on the bus. But, according to the music, the world is ending.<br /><br />The rolling under the clothes line: Wow, this one really demonstrates the plot writer's skills. In the room, followed by raw meat and skill selling. Why not just get her to perform all three 'sins' at once? At least then the film might have been slightly shorter.<br /><br />The running down the stairs of the mall: watch as one of the girls takes to flight down the stairs pursued by a flesh eating Dau, no wait .. she *is* just walking quickly trying not to break her nails.<br /><br />The running covered in blood: this is definitely my favourite scene, and a fitting end to the movie. A half marathon in red paint, completed by vaulting up stairs and over the bridge, only to be sent flying most unrealistically by a passing car. Not only this, but this suicide is undertaken by the most self obsessed girl in the film, now that's sticking to character for you.<br /><br />I'd like to think that this film was created by a 16 year old and their mates. Sadly, having met the director at the presentation, this is not the case.<br /><br />But, if you're in a sarcastic mood, and fancy a laugh with a few mates.. then still don't even think about it.","finished_norm":["make","the","unfortun","mistak","of","see","thi","film","in","the","edinburgh","film","festiv","it","be","good","shoot","from","the","outset","but","that","the","last","posit","comment","i","have","about","the","film","the","act","be","aw","i","wonder","if","actual","gogo","girl","be","hire","but","it","be","the","plot","that","be","truli","laughabl","in","fact","that","it","be","laughabl","and","not","bore","be","the","onli","reason","i","give","thi","br","br","spoiler","below","br","br","i","just","want","to","mention","a","few","of","the","scene","that","realli","get","the","audienc","laughingbr","br","shove","the","girl","in","the","field","who","would","have","think","that","a","kid","shove","anoth","kid","can","be","act","so","badli","a","real","eyeopenerbr","br","the","get","on","the","bu","scene","the","girl","be","get","on","the","bu","but","accord","to","the","music","the","world","be","endingbr","br","the","roll","under","the","cloth","line","wow","thi","on","realli","demonstr","the","plot","writer","skill","in","the","room","follow","by","raw","meat","and","skill","sell","why","not","just","get","her","to","perform","all","three","sin","at","onc","at","littl","then","the","film","mai","have","be","slightli","shorterbr","br","the","run","down","the","stair","of","the","mall","watch","a","on","of","the","girl","take","to","flight","down","the","stair","pursu","by","a","flesh","eat","dau","no","wait","she","be","just","walk","quickli","try","not","to","break","her","nailsbr","br","the","run","cover","in","blood","thi","be","definit","my","favourit","scene","and","a","fit","end","to","the","movi","a","half","marathon","in","red","paint","complet","by","vault","up","stair","and","over","the","bridg","onli","to","be","send","fly","much","unrealist","by","a","pass","car","not","onli","thi","but","thi","suicid","be","undertak","by","the","much","self","obsess","girl","in","the","film","now","that","stick","to","charact","for","youbr","br","i","have","like","to","think","that","thi","film","be","creat","by","a","year","old","and","their","mate","sadli","have","meet","the","director","at","the","present","thi","be","not","the","casebr","br","but","if","you","re","in","a","sarcast","mood","and","fanci","a","laugh","with","a","few","mate","then","still","do","not","even","think","about","it"],"filtered":["make","unfortun","mistak","see","thi","film","edinburgh","film","festiv","good","shoot","outset","last","posit","comment","film","act","aw","wonder","actual","gogo","girl","hire","plot","truli","laughabl","fact","laughabl","bore","onli","reason","give","thi","br","br","spoiler","br","br","want","mention","scene","realli","get","audienc","laughingbr","br","shove","girl","field","think","kid","shove","anoth","kid","act","badli","real","eyeopenerbr","br","get","bu","scene","girl","get","bu","accord","music","world","endingbr","br","roll","cloth","line","wow","thi","realli","demonstr","plot","writer","skill","room","follow","raw","meat","skill","sell","get","perform","three","sin","onc","littl","film","mai","slightli","shorterbr","br","run","stair","mall","watch","girl","take","flight","stair","pursu","flesh","eat","dau","wait","walk","quickli","try","break","nailsbr","br","run","cover","blood","thi","definit","favourit","scene","fit","end","movi","half","marathon","red","paint","complet","vault","stair","bridg","onli","send","fly","much","unrealist","pass","car","onli","thi","thi","suicid","undertak","much","self","obsess","girl","film","stick","charact","youbr","br","like","think","thi","film","creat","year","old","mate","sadli","meet","director","present","thi","casebr","br","re","sarcast","mood","fanci","laugh","mate","still","even","think"],"filtered2":["make","unfortun","mistak","see","edinburgh","festiv","good","shoot","outset","last","posit","comment","act","aw","wonder","actual","gogo","girl","hire","plot","truli","laughabl","fact","laughabl","bore","onli","reason","give","spoiler","want","mention","scene","realli","get","audienc","laughingbr","shove","girl","field","think","kid","shove","anoth","kid","act","badli","real","eyeopenerbr","get","bu","scene","girl","get","bu","accord","music","world","endingbr","roll","cloth","line","wow","realli","demonstr","plot","writer","skill","room","follow","raw","meat","skill","sell","get","perform","three","sin","onc","littl","mai","slightli","shorterbr","run","stair","mall","watch","girl","take","flight","stair","pursu","flesh","eat","dau","wait","walk","quickli","try","break","nailsbr","run","cover","blood","definit","favourit","scene","fit","end","half","marathon","red","paint","complet","vault","stair","bridg","onli","send","fly","unrealist","pass","car","onli","suicid","undertak","self","obsess","girl","stick","charact","youbr","like","think","creat","year","old","mate","sadli","meet","director","present","casebr","re","sarcast","mood","fanci","laugh","mate","still","even","think"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,

{"value":"I jumped at the chance to view this movie uncut and uninterrupted, remembering rahs and raves for it. But wherever it seemed about to slip into being truly scary, it backed off and went somewhere else. The dripping water throughout the house, the black rain, the prophetic dreams, taking the wrong turn in raw sewage were dropped before they could work up to a scream.<br /><br />What a disappointment. Chamberlain's nearly expressionless mask of a face offered little but confused disbelief, something I found myself mirroring as the film wore on. What could have been eerie Aboriginal chanting and instruments in the background were instead a cacophony seemingly designed to beat terror into one's head. The ideas that modern people can embody ancient gods, that the Aboriginal peoples believe red-haired white men were the first priests, and many other possibilities are passed along more like a shopping list than a hint at another dimension (the Dream Time).<br /><br />[SPOILER] In the final scene, it wasn't clear to me what the director was trying to tell. Is there a big wave? So what? How big? A tsunami? Yeah, okay. That's devastating but not apocalyptic. Is it the end of the world? From a wave? The last wave? That'd have to be a pretty darn big wave. Why? Was the world that bad a place? It didn't seem so awful in this movie. Actually I didn't think the wave came off, since the shadow left Burton's face that had been cast by the wave. Was it only Burton's apocalypse? Heck, that happens every day to people who lose it. It wasn't of any interest if it was only him.<br /><br />The most frightening scene, and the one that gives the best indication of Weir's potential, was in Charlie's apartment where Burton has gone to confront the old man for scaring Burton's wife. Charlie keeps asking him \"Who are you?\" and it becomes truly disturbing after a while.

{"value":"I just saw the movie in theater. The movie has very few good points to talk about. Kareena's beauty and a couple of songs may be. Thats it. The movie is a complete disappointment in all areas. Anyone associated with the movie will be disappointed, even Mumbai Indians too (just now Chennai has made it to semi-final). <br /><br />But the worst I feel about the movie is the action scenes. Now days Bollywood is trying to copy action scenes from Hollywood. But they forget that Hollywood directors takes a lot effect to make it look like real. But unfortunately Bollywood directors do not have that much of time. They spend their time on songs and publicity of the movie. Now such too stupid action scenes may work in South as the audience just pay to watch their favorite actor killing bunch of people. But in Bollywood this is certainly not going to work. All the action scenes I wish I could have forwarded. At the end even some Chinese people appear from nowhere to beat Akshay Kumar. This is height of stupidity. Audience is not paying to watch such stupidity. I think Bollywood now should forget about the action movies. They cant make it. The last good action I have seen was from \"Ghatak\" and \"Khiladiyon ka Khialdi\". The current scene in Bollywood is really sad for action movie fans like me. Does these people see their movie after completion? Can't they figure out that the slow motion action (which is done using ropes) is too unrealistic and childish? Better not to have action scenes if you cant handle it. I just want to go back to Amitabh's era where movie like Zanjeer and Deewar were having thrilling action scenes. The sound effect was not very effective in those days, but visually it is much better than current era scenes. <br /><br />This movie now should open the eyes of the Bollywood movie directors. Please don't make any more action movies, until you acquire the art of making it realistic.","finished_norm":["i","just","see","the","movi","in","theater","the","movi","have","veri","few","good","point","to","talk","about","kareena","beauti","and","a","coupl","of","song","mai","be","that","it","the","movi","be","a","complet","disappoint","in","all","area","anyon","associ","with","the","movi","will","be","disappoint","even","mumbai","indian","too","just","now","chennai","have","make","it","to","semifin","br","br","but","the","wrong","i","feel","about","the","movi","be","the","action","scene","now","dai","bollywood","be","try","to","copi","action","scene","from","hollywood","but","thei","forget","that","hollywood","director","take","a","lot","effect","to","make","it","look","like","real","but","unfortun","bollywood","director","do","not","have","that","much","of","time","thei","spend","their","time","on","song","and","public","of","the","movi","now","such","too","stupid","action","scene","mai","work","in","south","a","the","audienc","just","pai","to","watch","their","favorit","actor","kill","bunch","of","peopl","but","in","bollywood","thi","be","certainli","not","go","to","work","all","the","action","scene","i","wish","i","can","have","forward","at","the","end","even","some","chines","peopl","appear","from","nowher","to","beat","akshai","kumar","thi","be","height","of","stupid","audienc","be","not","pai","to","watch","such","stupid","i","think","bollywood","now","should","forget","about","the","action","movi","thei","cant","make","it","the","last","good","action","i","have","see","be","from","ghatak","and","khiladiyon","ka","khialdi","the","current","scene","in","bollywood","be","realli","sad","for","action","movi","fan","like","me","doe","thi","peopl","see","their","movi","after","complet","ca","not","thei","figur","out","that","the","slow","motion","action","which","be","do","us","rope","be","too","unrealist","and","childish","well","not","to","have","action","scene","if","you","cant","handl","it","i","just","want","to","go","back","to","amitabh","era","where","movi","like","zanjeer","and","deewar","be","have","thrill","action","scene","the","sound","effect","be","not","veri","effect","in","that","dai","but","visual","it","be","much","well","than","current","era","scene","br","br","thi","movi","now","should","open","the","ey","of","the","bollywood","movi","director","pleas","do","not","make","ani","much","action","movi","until","you","acquir","the","art","of","make","it","realist"],"filtered":["see","movi","theater","movi","veri","good","point","talk","kareena","beauti","coupl","song","mai","movi","complet","disappoint","area","anyon","associ","movi","disappoint","even","mumbai","indian","chennai","make","semifin","br","br","wrong","feel","movi","action","scene","dai","bollywood","try","copi","action","scene","hollywood","thei","forget","hollywood","director","take","lot","effect","make","look","like","real","unfortun","bollywood","director","much","time","thei","spend","time","song","public","movi","stupid","action","scene","mai","work","south","audienc","pai","watch","favorit","actor","kill","bunch","peopl","bollywood","thi","certainli","go","work","action","scene","wish","forward","end","even","chines","peopl","appear","nowher","beat","akshai","kumar","thi","height","stupid","audienc","pai","watch","stupid","think","bollywood","forget","action","movi","thei","cant","make","last","good","action","see","ghatak","khiladiyon","ka","khialdi","current","scene","bollywood","realli","sad","action","movi","fan","like","doe","thi","peopl","see","movi","complet","ca","thei","figur","slow","motion","action","us","rope","unrealist","childish","well","action","scene","cant","handl","want","go","back","amitabh","era","movi","like","zanjeer","deewar","thrill","action","scene","sound","effect","veri","effect","dai","visual","much","well","current","era","scene","br","br","thi","movi","open","ey","bollywood","movi","director","pleas","make","ani","much","action","movi","acquir","art","make","realist"],"filtered2":["see","theater","veri","good","point","talk","kareena","beauti","coupl","song","mai","complet","disappoint","area","anyon","associ","disappoint","even","mumbai","indian","chennai","make","semifin","wrong","feel","action","scene","dai","bollywood","try","copi","action","scene","hollywood","forget","hollywood","director","take","lot","effect","make","look","like","real","unfortun","bollywood","director","time","spend","time","song","public","stupid","action","scene","mai","work","south","audienc","pai","watch","favorit","actor","kill","bunch","peopl","bollywood","certainli","go","work","action","scene","wish","forward","end","even","chines","peopl","appear","nowher","beat","akshai","kumar","height","stupid","audienc","pai","watch","stupid","think","bollywood","forget","action","cant","make","last","good","action","see","ghatak","khiladiyon","ka","khialdi","current","scene","bollywood","realli","sad","action","fan","like","doe","peopl","see","complet","ca","figur","slow","motion","action","us",

{"value":"Every once in a while I will rent an action/adventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important. This is why I own a copy of Charlie's Angels (2000) - not a quality film, but it makes me laugh and allows me to unwind for a while. One of these days I will probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and a few Monty Python movies for much the same reason.<br /><br />In any case, I rented this film because I wanted to be entertained without being challenged. For the most part, I got what I wanted. The plot was something along the lines of a poorly written Xena episode, and the Kathy Long's acting was very community theater (not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress). There were a few high points on the part of the cyborgs. Somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys - unfortunately, most of them die pretty darned quick.<br /><br />Like most martial arts films, the further you get into the movie, the more emphasis there is on action, and the plot (which wasn't strong to begin with) deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting. However, the more Kathy Long fights, the more time the director devotes to her backside. By the end of the movie I was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times Kathy Long's tight red shorts were center screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there just wasn't enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time. If you are a hard core Xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hours - by all means, go to the grocery store and spend the .50 cents on the rental. There are some strong similarities between the show and this movie.<br /><br />Just don't expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hours.<br /><br />Unless, of course, you happen to like Kathy Long's derrière.

{"value":"After reading all of the rave reviews about this film and a few that give it a so-so. I finally decided to throw in my no cents worth. I agree with most on the point that if it hadn't been for Lauren Lewis and Chris Ferry it would have been a disaster. Filmed in Mariette OH. just north of Dogpatch where all the real talent fled south down I-77 years ago, at least as far as a tank of gas would allow. I did get a chuckle from reviewers who subtly claim that they cerebrate a little better than most by claiming they followed the plot without an inkling of confusion. This wee tale by the Brothers Crook is like an old record with a skip in it. As an American I understand the difficulties Ind film artists have to face. A trip to Romania would have wiped out the budget for sure. Lets face it this whole film was a loop de loop of Claire in the gas station, Claire on the side of the road, Claire under the bleachers, Claire in the house, Claire in the cornfield, Claire at school. Claire here and Claire there. It almost became monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actor in the cast. Josh and Jeff have to make a living but don't write a two page script and turn it into an hour,twenty flick. Before writing another screenplay about dreaming ghosts watch an episode or two of Ghost Whisperer or something and get a little background. All of the cast except the above mentioned and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film. Also, there is an appearance by co-director Jeff as he is in all his films. Just like Alfred Hitchcock, eh? One thing the film had going for it is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on Lauren Lewis' derrière. Well, with all sarcasm now satisfied I still recommend the film for the horror buff just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career (I hope)and that Chris Ferry has established himself as a villain worth

{"value":"Henry, a veterinarian (Paul Rudd), and his bossy fiancé, Kate (Eva Longoria) are looking over the last minute arrangements for their reception. It is the morning of their wedding and Kate is in a frenzy, giving the caterers an earful about her demands for food presentation. But, horror of horrors, the \"angel\" ice sculpture, ordered by Kate, arrives without wings. In an ensuing fight with the sculptor, the heavy \"ice\" maiden falls on Kate and sends her to the hereafter. Now, one year later, Henry's sister arranges for a psychic to tell the young vet that Kate would have wanted him to starting dating other ladies and move forward. Yet, the lovely medium, Ashley (Lake Bell) becomes interested in Henry herself, much to the chagrin of her catering partner (Jason Biggs). More importantly, Kate returns from the other side to create havoc for Ashley, as she has no intentions of letting another woman get her hands on Henry. Can anything be done to return Kate into heaven for good? This is an abysmal romantic comedy, one of the worst this dedicated fan has ever seen. No, its not the cast, as they try gamely to make things work. Longoria is beautiful and funny as the overbearing fiancé and Bell has an offbeat style and humor that is likewise infectious. Biggs, a funny thespian, too, is totally wasted. As for Rudd, a very gifted performer (see Anchorman, Knocked Up, or Clueless, please) he tries hardest of all and, in truth, is the main reason to see this clunker. His charm, looks, and easy wit go a long way in making the film bearable. But, nothing can turn a mindless script and terrible direction into a winner, absolutely nothing. So, if you are a dyed-in-the-wool fan of romantic comedy, think long and hard before you fork over any money for this one. Even were free tickets to fall into your lap, be warned that this movie is a near-death experience for those who adore love-and-laugh

{"value":"Following the success of \"Paris, Je T'Aime\", a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in New York. Unlike the original film, the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly--by the time you think are getting into a story, it's over in too many cases. And, the often start up and stop and then begin again--with the stories woven together. As a result, there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure.<br /><br />Sadly, however, while \"Paris, Je T'Aime\" was hit or miss (mostly hit), most of \"New York, I Love You\" was miss. The stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet--and often quite terrible. It was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories--and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so. Now understand, it was good quality music but its somber tone really, really made me feel like cutting my wrists! Among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom, the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant (though this was also in the first film) and the crotchety old couple. This is all so sad because I had loved the first film so much--and I really WANTED to love this film. I respected what they tried but simply didn't like it very much.<br /><br />By the way, and this is NOT really a complaint, but I was amazed how many people were smoking in the film. For a recent film, that was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture.<br /><br />Also, if you get the DVD, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film. One consists of Kevin Bacon (wearing a cool fedora) eating a hotdog....and absolutely NOTHING more for almost ten minutes. The other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world--including a very unhappy

{"value":"I just saw this film tonight and I have to say that it's a mess. I love Vince Vaughn but he ends up more annoying that funny here and the film is more than less a remake of the crappy 80's classic \" Santa Claus the movie\" but with out the camp or the bad Sheena Easton song at the end. .The story is your run of the mill black sheep in the family who comes back to face his family for the holidays kind of thing but with North Pole as its setting. Of course Fred (Vince Vaughn) is the family screw up who comes home after a series of set backs that include his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz in a cameo role) dumping him, so he comes home to face his parents and his more successful brother Santa Claus (Paul Giamatti) and wacky high jinks follow with a bit of sibling rivalry and a bit of anarky as well that threatens all of Christmas. Now if you think you know the ending of this film, I think you would be right because it's predicable to the hill. As for the acting, Vince Vaughn plays the same lovable loser he always plays but this time he ends up more annoying than likable, Miranda Richardson plays Mrs. Claus but the role is more than less one note, Elizabeth Banks plays Santa's assistant but she's not much of a character at all other than a neurotic joke and poor Kevin Spacey ends up basically playing the same person he plays in the film \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" but a little more anal. The only two actors who come out of this film with their dignity intact is Paul Giamatti, who brings a real sincerity and warmed to his role as Santa Claus but he looks somewhat embarrass to be in the movie and you can't blame him and Rachel Weisz, who manages to do a lot more with a very small role than most of the main actors do with theirs, which is a shame because both Rachel Weisz and Paul Giamatti deserved a lot better than what this script gave them.<br /><br />To put it in a nutshell, a major disappointment.","finished_norm":["i","just","see","thi","film","tonight","and","i","have","to","sai","that","it","a","mess","i","love","vinc","vaughn","but","he","end","up","much","annoi","that","funni","here","and","the","film","be","much","than","littl","a","remak","of","the","crappi","classic","santa","clau","the","movi","but","with","out","the","camp","or","the","bad","sheena","easton","song","at","the","end","the","stori","be","your","run","of","the","mill","black","sheep","in","the","famili","who","come","back","to","face","hi","famili","for","the","holidai","kind","of","thing","but","with","north","pole","a","it","set","of","cours","fred","vinc","vaughn","be","the","famili","screw","up","who","come","home","after","a","seri","of","set","back","that","includ","hi","girlfriend","rachel","weisz","in","a","cameo","role","dump","him","so","he","come","home","to","face","hi","parent","and","hi","much","success","brother","santa","clau","paul","giamatti","and","wacki","high","jink","follow","with","a","bite","of","sibl","rivalri","and","a","bite","of","anarki","a","good","that","threaten","all","of","christma","now","if","you","think","you","know","the","end","of","thi","film","i","think","you","would","be","right","becaus","it","predic","to","the","hill","a","for","the","act","vinc","vaughn","plai","the","same","lovabl","loser","he","alwai","plai","but","thi","time","he","end","up","much","annoi","than","likabl","miranda","richardson","plai","mr","clau","but","the","role","be","much","than","littl","on","note","elizabeth","bank","plai","santa","assist","but","she","not","much","of","a","charact","at","all","other","than","a","neurot","joke","and","poor","kevin","spacei","end","up","basic","plai","the","same","person","he","plai","in","the","film","glengarri","glen","ross","but","a","littl","much","anal","the","onli","two","actor","who","come","out","of","thi","film","with","their","digniti","intact","be","paul","giamatti","who","bring","a","real","sincer","and","warm","to","hi","role","a","santa","clau","but","he","look","somewhat","embarrass","to","be","in","the","movi","and","you","ca","not","blame","him","and","rachel","weisz","who","manag","to","do","a","lot","much","with","a","veri","small","role","than","much","of","the","main","actor","do","with","their","which","be","a","shame","becaus","both","rachel","weisz","and","paul","giamatti","deserv","a","lot","well","than","what","thi","script","give","thembr","br","to","put","it","in","a","nutshel","a","major","disappoint"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","tonight","sai","mess","love","vinc","vaughn","end","much","annoi","funni","film","much","littl","remak","crappi","classic","santa","clau","movi","camp","bad","sheena","easton","song","end","stori","run","mill","black","sheep","famili","come","back","face","hi","famili","holidai","kind","thing","north","pole","set","cours","fred","vinc","vaughn","famili","screw","come","home","seri","set","back","includ","hi","girlfriend","rachel","weisz","cameo","role","dump","come","home","face","hi","parent","hi","much","success","brother","santa","clau","paul","giamatti","wacki","high","jink","follow","bite","sibl","rivalri","bite","anarki","good","threaten","christma","think","know","end","thi","film","think","right","becaus","predic","hill","act","vinc","vaughn","plai","lovabl","loser","alwai","plai","thi","time","end","much","annoi","likabl","miranda","richardson","plai","mr","clau","role","much","littl","note","elizabeth","bank","plai","santa","assist","much","charact","neurot","joke","poor","kevin","spacei","end","basic","plai","person","plai","film","glengarri","glen","ross","littl","much","anal","onli","two","actor","come","thi","film","digniti","intact","paul","giamatti","bring","real","sincer","warm","hi","role","santa","clau","look","somewhat","embarrass","movi","ca","blame","rachel","weisz","manag","lot","much","veri","small","role","much","main","actor","shame","becaus","rachel","weisz","paul","giamatti","deserv","lot","well","thi","script","give","thembr","br","put","nutshel","major","disappoint"],"filtered2":["see","tonight","mess","love","vinc","vaughn","end","annoi","funni","littl","remak","crappi","classic","santa","clau","camp","bad","sheena","easton","song","end","stori","run","mill","black","sheep","famili","come","back","face","famili","holidai","kind","thing","north","pole","set","cours","fred","vinc","vaughn","famili","screw","come","home","set","back","includ","girlfriend","rachel","weisz","cameo","role","dump","come","home","face","parent","success","brother","santa","clau","paul","giamatti","wacki","high","jink","follow","bite","sibl","rivalri","bite","anarki","good","threaten","christma","think","know","end","think","right","becaus","predic","hill","act","vinc","vaughn","plai","lovabl","loser","alwai","plai","time","end","annoi","likabl","miranda","richardson","plai","mr","clau","role","littl","note","elizabeth","bank","plai","santa","assist","charact","neurot","joke","poor","kevin","space

{"value":"I am a massive fan of the book and Orwell is certainly my favourite writer ever since studying Animal Farm at GCSE. I bought the DVD out of sheer curiosity, Burton is an actor I hold in high regard so when I heard that he played the role of O'Brien I was swung.<br /><br />I watched the trailer on the DVD first and some fears started to set in, mostly regarding the frankly terrible \"Theme song\", hearing the Eurythmics mechanically shouting \"1984!\" over and over again to an electronic beat is as bad as it sounds.<br /><br />The acting on a whole is pretty good, Burton and Hurt play their roles well and the tension that exists in the Ministry of Truth towards the end can be felt, especially in the harrowing Room 101 scene. However this is also where the movie is let down. The movie spends too much time focusing on the Love affair between Winston and Julia, which frankly isn't what Orwell was writing about. He was writing about a harrowing future, about how Ingsoc build up a mans beliefs and then shatter them all in the name of him being made to love Big Brother. The movie skips over what is essentially the most important part of the book, Winstons coming to terms with his position in life and the world, and his re-education via O'Brien.<br /><br />The comment on IMDb at the moment states that the movie sticks to the book is completely incorrect. Julia is not present when Winston visits O'Brien, they do not commit themselves to Goldstien's Brotherhood and confess their crimes. There is no obvious mention of the initial instances where Winston finds the article with the Unpersons but it does get mentioned near the end, if you have not read the book it is completely confusing.<br /><br />A terrible screenplay, which some excellent acting cannot rescue. Michael Radford seems to have completely missed the point Orwell was trying to make, and the electronica sound track is frankly terrible.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","massiv","fan","of","the","book","and","orwel","be","certainli","my","favourit","writer","ever","sinc","studi","anim","farm","at","gcse","i","bui","the","dvd","out","of","sheer","curios","burton","be","a","actor","i","hold","in","high","regard","so","when","i","hear","that","he","plai","the","role","of","o","brien","i","be","swungbr","br","i","watch","the","trailer","on","the","dvd","and","some","fear","start","to","set","in","mostli","regard","the","frankli","terribl","theme","song","hear","the","eurythm","mechan","shout","over","and","over","again","to","a","electron","beat","be","a","bad","a","it","soundsbr","br","the","act","on","a","whole","be","pretti","good","burton","and","hurt","plai","their","role","good","and","the","tension","that","exist","in","the","ministri","of","truth","toward","the","end","can","be","feel","especi","in","the","harrow","room","scene","howev","thi","be","conjur","where","the","movi","be","let","down","the","movi","spend","too","much","time","focu","on","the","love","affair","between","winston","and","julia","which","frankli","be","not","what","orwel","be","write","about","he","be","write","about","a","harrow","futur","about","how","ingsoc","build","up","a","man","belief","and","then","shatter","them","all","in","the","name","of","him","be","make","to","love","big","brother","the","movi","skip","over","what","be","essenti","the","much","import","part","of","the","book","winston","come","to","term","with","hi","posit","in","life","and","the","world","and","hi","reeduc","via","obrienbr","br","the","comment","on","imdb","at","the","moment","state","that","the","movi","stick","to","the","book","be","complet","incorrect","julia","be","not","present","when","winston","visit","o","brien","thei","do","not","commit","themselv","to","goldstien","brotherhood","and","confess","their","crime","there","be","no","obviou","mention","of","the","initi","instanc","where","winston","find","the","articl","with","the","unperson","but","it","doe","get","mention","near","the","end","if","you","have","not","read","the","book","it","be","complet","confusingbr","br","a","terribl","screenplai","which","some","excel","act","cannot","rescu","michael","radford","seem","to","have","complet","miss","the","point","orwel","be","try","to","make","and","the","electronica","sound","track","be","frankli","terribl"],"filtered":["massiv","fan","book","orwel","certainli","favourit","writer","ever","sinc","studi","anim","farm","gcse","bui","dvd","sheer","curios","burton","actor","hold","high","regard","hear","plai","role","o","brien","swungbr","br","watch","trailer","dvd","fear","start","set","mostli","regard","frankli","terribl","theme","song","hear","eurythm","mechan","shout","electron","beat","bad","soundsbr","br","act","whole","pretti","good","burton","hurt","plai","role","good","tension","exist","ministri","truth","toward","end","feel","especi","harrow","room","scene","howev","thi","conjur","movi","let","movi","spend","much","time","focu","love","affair","winston","julia","frankli","orwel","write","write","harrow","futur","ingsoc","build","man","belief","shatter","name","make","love","big","brother","movi","skip","essenti","much","import","part","book","winston","come","term","hi","posit","life","world","hi","reeduc","via","obrienbr","br","comment","imdb","moment","state","movi","stick","book","complet","incorrect","julia","present","winston","visit","o","brien","thei","commit","themselv","goldstien","brotherhood","confess","crime","obviou","mention","initi","instanc","winston","find","articl","unperson","doe","get","mention","near","end","read","book","complet","confusingbr","br","terribl","screenplai","excel","act","rescu","michael","radford","seem","complet","miss","point","orwel","try","make","electronica","sound","track","frankli","terribl"],"filtered2":["massiv","fan","book","orwel","certainli","favourit","writer","ever","sinc","studi","anim","farm","gcse","bui","dvd","sheer","curios","burton","actor","hold","high","regard","hear","plai","role","o","brien","swungbr","watch","trailer","dvd","fear","start","set","mostli","regard","frankli","terribl","theme","song","hear","eurythm","mechan","shout","electron","beat","bad","soundsbr","act","whole","pretti","good","burton","hurt","plai","role","good","tension","exist","ministri","truth","toward","end","feel","especi","harrow","room","scene","howev","conjur","let","spend","time","focu","love","affair","winston","julia","frankli","orwel","write","write","harrow","futur","ingsoc","build","man","belief","shatter","name","make","love","big","brother","skip","essenti","import","part","book","winston","come","term","posit","life","world","reeduc","via","obrienbr","comment","imdb","moment","state","stick","book","complet","incorrect","julia","present","winston","visit","o","brien","commit","themselv","goldstien","brotherhood","confess","crime","obviou","mention","initi","instanc","winston","find","articl","unperson","doe","get","

{"value":"You know that feeling of hilarity you get when you watch a film that's trying so hard to be a serious, thought provoking piece of cinema and fails miserably? When you can't help but bust out laughing at the sheer terrible nature of the trash littering your screen? \"House of the Dead\" struggles to achieve even this low graded level of cinema.<br /><br />From start to end \"House of the Dead\" manages to recreate the feeling like you've just woken up to find out that the cat has laid it's curled business neatly on your forehead while you slept. It is clear from the start that the female actors have been cast for their cleavage size (which they exploit shamelessly) whereas the males for their hardcore \"kick-ass\" attitude. I honestly did not care any of the characters for any moment of the film and found myself actually wishing their demise so as to spare me a good hour of this torture. Uwe Boll should have considered screening two hours of footage from the actual game as a movie. At least then we'll get better acting However not all blame can be placed on the actors as it is certainly a challenge to produce a convincing film when faced with the script of this film. It is arguably the worst section of the film and actually contains such lines as: \"These are zombies, pure and simple\" and \"No cap'n, we must not go there! It's evil!\".<br /><br />We all know that Zombie movies are never going to be particularly thought provoking or full of meaning; at best they are a harmless two hours of action, blood and closet terror. Trash, yes, but entertaining trash. Not the kind of trash which bursts out of your bin bag as you haul it across the room and smothers your shoes in sour milk cartons and decaying banana skins.
