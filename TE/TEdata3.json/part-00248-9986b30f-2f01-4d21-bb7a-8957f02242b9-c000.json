{"value":"Yet another example of the complete waste of UK Lottery money. Just how commercial did this film prove. The Film Council ,who funded this miserable garbage should be stranded, on one of the London Undergrounds disused stations, for allowing this clichéd, dismal specimen to be committed to film, a half mutant thing made up of all the horror movies the director has seen and felt fit to imitate, most notably Deathline. Amongst its many sins is the quite obvious failure to make the lead character remotely sympathetic until the last minute. It's a little bit too late then! Surely all those development executives, at the UK Film Council, could have noticed this at the script stage. Add to this the terrible acting and the laughable appearance of the creature and you get a prime example of how not to scare.","finished_norm":["yet","anoth","exampl","of","the","complet","wast","of","uk","lotteri","monei","just","how","commerci","do","thi","film","prove","the","film","council","who","fund","thi","miser","garbag","should","be","strand","on","on","of","the","london","underground","disus","station","for","allow","thi","clichéd","dismal","specimen","to","be","commit","to","film","a","half","mutant","thing","make","up","of","all","the","horror","movi","the","director","have","see","and","feel","fit","to","imit","much","notabl","deathlin","amongst","it","mani","sin","be","the","quit","obviou","failur","to","make","the","lead","charact","remot","sympathet","until","the","last","minut","it","a","littl","bite","too","late","then","sure","all","that","develop","execut","at","the","uk","film","council","can","have","notic","thi","at","the","script","stage","add","to","thi","the","terribl","act","and","the","laughabl","appear","of","the","creatur","and","you","get","a","prime","exampl","of","how","not","to","scare"],"filtered":["yet","anoth","exampl","complet","wast","uk","lotteri","monei","commerci","thi","film","prove","film","council","fund","thi","miser","garbag","strand","london","underground","disus","station","allow","thi","clichéd","dismal","specimen","commit","film","half","mutant","thing","make","horror","movi","director","see","feel","fit","imit","much","notabl","deathlin","amongst","mani","sin","quit","obviou","failur","make","lead","charact","remot","sympathet","last","minut","littl","bite","late","sure","develop","execut","uk","film","council","notic","thi","script","stage","add","thi","terribl","act","laughabl","appear","creatur","get","prime","exampl","scare"],"filtered2":["yet","anoth","exampl","complet","wast","uk","lotteri","monei","commerci","prove","council","fund","miser","garbag","strand","london","underground","disus","station","allow","clichéd","dismal","specimen","commit","half","mutant","thing","make","horror","director","see","feel","fit","imit","notabl","deathlin","amongst","mani","sin","quit","obviou","failur","make","lead","charact","remot","sympathet","last","minut","littl","bite","late","sure","develop","execut","uk","council","notic","script","stage","add","terribl","act","laughabl","appear","creatur","get","prime","exampl","scare"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,10,14,21,29,43,50,58,59,73,77,83,89,103,119,120,126,144,150,154,157,166,169,194,206,299,307,320,383,521,540,552,623,662,669,676,688,702,761,883,969,1092,1125,1259,1267,1330,1534,1684,1721,1838,1967,2108,2191,2196,2279,2284,2309,2837,3152,7868],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,10,14,21,29,43,50,58,59,73,77,83,89,103,119,120,126,144,150,154,157,166,169,194,206,299,307,320,383,521,540,552,623,662,669,676,688,702,761,883,969,1092,1125,1259,1267,1330,1534,1684,1721,1838,1967,2108,2191,2196,2279,2284,2309,2837,3152,7868],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,1.1238870241028365,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,1.3195384777338066,1.6608112036218214,1.717994385570355,1.865701314626681,1.8693254449200722,1.8950689206770979,1.9463902258768238,2.292318797740072,1.9940046109572438,2.098582041218749,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.2391270689902285,2.2931108769894046,2.332712011146513,2.348499626138016,2.3360150694757706,2.4423870329693536,2.4214486257841834,2.5378812223426954,2.597304642813496,2.7949961309240425,5.753571127865041,2.938298364153555,3.0433232530252132,3.4076979462652486,3.432149042129413,3.424750734647968,3.607563812710113,3.616452760127359,3.7099788181381825,3.6105180246075443,3.6016814428070463,3.6466665387238555,3.9405024767500145,3.8614098879127985,4.0536665665501035,4.550761997504193,4.240607069200353,4.390138803171316,4.327618446189983,4.370968887063596,4.566029469634981,4.724033718778229,4.724033718778229,9.823550686083045,5.064116067623542,5.02684467282631,5.014723312293965,5.039114765418124,5.02684467282631,5.185068678041204,5.3064295350454715,5.3560264761848435,5.521540914662417,13.897314540605125]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.7150356942402935E-5,5.676497872487754E-5,5.720627230626651E-5,5.687573385544208E-5,5.687666570030637E-5,5.67971634877869E-5,5.696608621001864E-5,5.677315251090044E-5,5.6900799254013735E-5,0.11186376338354152,0.6213077006847454,5.6681508125650336E-5,5.773944036662157E-5,5.856310617088674E-5,5.6722839690079746E-5,5.6566082234777277E-5,0.061675473016319884,5.6971423502298464E-5,5.6794669882817876E-5,5.6841742566230375E-5,5.739171976391096E-5,5.702786776651209E-5,5.709280264545838E-5,5.7154313736830733E-5,5.759294373190965E-5,5.729174884984627E-5,5.970018513316813E-5,5.66983590183054E-5,5.669987583218975E-5,5.6843524646971915E-5,5.8051720456130156E-

{"value":"A far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so bad, that it becomes incredibly annoying to sit through. A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck. He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers. This scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotted corpse?

{"value":"I'm going to go on the record as the second person who has, after years of using the IMDb to look up movies, been motivated by Nacho's film, The Abandoned to create an account and post a comment. This was hands down the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. The plot was on the verge of non-existence, and none of the \"puzzle-pieces\" added up in any way whatsoever. The acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing. How this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me. The only saving grace I could find was Anastasia Hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f word. (and brilliant sound design) If I were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores I would be up against a difficult decision.

{"value":"I rated this movie as AWFUL (1). After watching the trailer, I thought this movie could be pretty cool. \"Guaranteed to offend...everyone!\" the trailer said. Well...it did offend me, because this movie really sucks. It is hardly a comedy, as I laughed about two seconds during the entire movie. And what's with all the gays in this movie? I'm not gay and I don't have a problem with those who are, but what's the point of adding so many gay-scenes in a so called comedy movie, when these scenes are absolutely not funny? I guess the director is a gay man in denial, or something like that.<br /><br />So my advice to you is: if you want to waste good money, go rent a good comedy you've already seen a million times, you'll be better off than watching this Mother Of All Lousy Comedy's.

{"value":"This movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever. It really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be made. But, if you can stand the mind-numbing plot, character development, and direction, you may get a kick out of the soundtrack which is so appalling that it is funny. The movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable. Someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort of consolation because their career was probably ruined because of involvement in this movie. If you do end up seeing this movie or have seen it already (I feel your pain) then these words have come too late. For anyone else, Stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste 2 hours of your life.

{"value":"There is no story! The plot is hopeless! A filmed based on a car with a stuck accelerator, no brakes, and a stuck automatic transmission gear lever cannot be good! I would have stopped that car within one minute whether I was in it or in the police car constantly following it. I feel sorry for the actors that had to put up with such a poor script. The few scenes that some similarity to action was heavily over-dramatized, and as far from reality you can get. In addition, there were a lot of blunders, for instance the hood of the runaway car, which was popped doing 100mph. At first it just folded over the windshield, like it would in reality, but then, afterwards, it blew off.

{"value":"Born Again is a sub-standard episode from season one. It deals with the subject of reincarnation and just doesn't fly. I've never been big on reincarnation and that could be part of my apathy toward this episode. It does reference the Tooms case which is some nice continuation from the previous episode. But the positives end there. Which is unfortunate because that takes place at the beginning of the episode. I think it's ludicrous that a dead guy would chose to reincarnate in the body of a completely unrelated girl. And he waits until the girl turns eight to start exacting revenge. There's even a serious lack of witty Mulder & Scully dialogue to keep the episode afloat. If you're into reincarnation, maybe this episode is up your alley. If you're not, then at least you can learn what bradycardia is.","finished_norm":["bear","again","be","a","substandard","episod","from","season","on","it","deal","with","the","subject","of","reincarn","and","just","doe","not","fly","i","have","never","be","big","on","reincarn","and","that","can","be","part","of","my","apathi","toward","thi","episod","it","doe","refer","the","toom","case","which","be","some","nice","continu","from","the","previou","episod","but","the","posit","end","there","which","be","unfortun","becaus","that","take","place","at","the","begin","of","the","episod","i","think","it","ludicr","that","a","dead","gui","would","choos","to","reincarn","in","the","bodi","of","a","complet","unrel","girl","and","he","wait","until","the","girl","turn","eight","to","start","exact","reveng","there","even","a","seriou","lack","of","witti","mulder","sculli","dialogu","to","keep","the","episod","afloat","if","you","re","into","reincarn","mayb","thi","episod","be","up","your","allei","if","you","re","not","then","at","littl","you","can","learn","what","bradycardia","be"],"filtered":["bear","substandard","episod","season","deal","subject","reincarn","doe","fly","never","big","reincarn","part","apathi","toward","thi","episod","doe","refer","toom","case","nice","continu","previou","episod","posit","end","unfortun","becaus","take","place","begin","episod","think","ludicr","dead","gui","choos","reincarn","bodi","complet","unrel","girl","wait","girl","turn","eight","start","exact","reveng","even","seriou","lack","witti","mulder","sculli","dialogu","keep","episod","afloat","re","reincarn","mayb","thi","episod","allei","re","littl","learn","bradycardia"],"filtered2":["bear","substandard","season","deal","subject","reincarn","doe","fly","never","big","reincarn","part","apathi","toward","doe","refer","toom","case","nice","continu","previou","posit","end","unfortun","becaus","take","place","begin","think","ludicr","dead","gui","choos","reincarn","bodi","complet","unrel","girl","wait","girl","turn","eight","start","exact","reveng","even","seriou","lack","witti","mulder","sculli","dialogu","keep","afloat","re","reincarn","mayb","allei","re","littl","learn","bradycardia"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,12,14,18,22,24,31,42,55,61,68,71,82,84,96,103,134,147,163,164,183,227,228,248,262,288,331,376,430,433,468,493,509,525,550,563,584,652,715,784,817,871,1394,1723,2208,2275,3241,3540,3895,6414,7450],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,12,14,18,22,24,31,42,55,61,68,71,82,84,96,103,134,147,163,164,183,227,228,248,262,288,331,376,430,433,468,493,509,525,550,563,584,652,715,784,817,871,1394,1723,2208,2275,3241,3540,3895,6414,7450],"values":[0.926017105726131,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,2.430631986809635,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.6219954307453837,1.9536997889255368,1.8818517047392527,4.012839573363895,1.9214926742550966,2.020196584395323,4.442538903180445,2.0390708128715254,2.098582041218749,2.2443961816702407,2.2844323215331563,2.4000574358028657,2.3930275298746078,2.4885128563647294,2.6005321873043625,2.7742700004069256,2.689504733779216,2.726701583487816,2.8015621426949333,2.932274249550174,3.1569204307489187,3.2189558216683714,3.164467636384302,3.304513710030018,3.342254038012865,3.360519385990158,3.4149707055943286,3.4751392270607813,3.459754308221302,3.5146700658174166,3.7810747398219124,3.68099128126493,3.7636829971100436,4.197121957260614,3.9954846111673676,4.403125998698128,4.760735085628657,5.039114765418124,5.0768550934009715,5.672363804397,5.695894301807195,23.998306862421668,6.489124940924123,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.806761879357485E-5,6.760862292713952E-5,6.813421550225343E-5,6.77405352792233E-5,6.774164513162653E-5,6.764695584909982E-5,6.78481473740107E-5,6.761835812707307E-5,6.777038884595787E-5,7.518754698482828E-5,0.4646927217168272,6.750920718885473E-5,6.876923306341639E-5,6.97502412841442E-5,6.755843419848757E-5,6.737173183508268E-5,6.905223541058716E-5,6.785450423328035E-5,6.764398589822752E-5,6.770005073564125E-5,6.835508843338668E-5,6.792173087656184E-5,6.799907007132798E-5,6.807233144261442E-5,6.859475161448753E-5,6.823602037444423E-5,7.110453304160016E-5,6.752927705716251E-5,6.753108362346909E-5,6.77021732419398E-5,6.914116708494693E-5,6.785057264418749E-5,7.283184199475374E-5,6.804142629255789E-5,6.76027796383679E-5,6.791481103061012E-5,6.753503996378914E-5,6.757494820353828E-5,6.737139335405471E-5,6.738887260172396E-5,6.754055676397842E-5,6.82529665235316E-5,6.790614451856993E-5,0.5299879943576115,6.845953112863916E-5,6.766362231007342E-5,6.991174847499666E-5,6.888367583556615E-5,6.740562242057666E-5,6.755459296826285E-5,6.753116249029065E-5,6.943174325525699E-5,6.755559805181913E-5,6.738289000974659E-5,6.812251365994846E-5,6.757299858051657E-5,7

I can only conclude that the writers picked up a quantum physics book, didn't understand a word of it, then watched The Matrix about a thousand times, and proceeded to write this movie.<br /><br />For example, the Washington DC crime experiment was done by The Transcendental Meditation Program. A brief search will reveal the science of their methods.

{"value":"Misty Ayers had a smoking body, and that's all this movie was about. Pure exploitation flick. I started playing a game with myself, counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music. And of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. Case in point: casually walking into a room and saying \"Hello\" was scored with chase music from a roman epic. I'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released. What I learned from this movie: that women's low-rise panties existed in 1954. I'm talking Sigourney Weaver in the original Alien movie panties. At least 20 of the first 30 minutes is Misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing (except for bra and panties, sadly). Also includes horrendous dubbing, leading to a \"Look out!

{"value":"Wow! This film is truly awful. I can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight. The cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast. The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. The telling, leaden and predictable. No wit, no charm, no humour. Not sexy in the least. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on. When your lead (Carrell) is unfunny and unappealing it's uphill from there. Despite it's phony turn-around ending where love triumphs over lust I was left with a sick feeling in my stomach.

{"value":"This film deals with two ex-football players who are Fred Williamson, (Mack Derringer) and Gary Busey, (Lenny) who work as private eyes and meet all kinds of ladies and men with some bad backgrounds. Mack Derringer is approached by his ex-wife Vanity (Jennifer Derringer) who works at having sex talk over the telephone. Jennifer is being threatened by one caller who wants to do horrible things to her and she asks for his help along with several other ladies. Mack & Lenny have more time on their hands and often go to Miami, Fl. golf courses or hang out in a Sports Bar where all kinds of city things go on. There is lots of punches, killings and plenty of double meaning words that bring this film completely down to a big ZERO.

{"value":"urgh! 3 things a movie needs: a good script, a good plot and good casting. i watched this movie expecting it to be hilariously terrible and was unfortunately disappointed when it was just plain terrible. I lost the will to live halfway through. The only thing which stopped me from stabbing my eyes out with a fork was Rose Byrne (who was the reason for me watching it in the first place). She did a good job as Rastus and her appearance hasn't changed much since she was 13. it was a fantastic first effort in a movie. the dog was also very good. both did a great job with such awful material. Sandra Bernhard i think was the biggest mistake of the movie. she was completely miscast, and i don't think she ever quite got the character.<br /><br />I give the movie 2 out of 10 - and thats only

{"value":"The potential was there. I saw Creep and thought, 'Oooh, this is getting interesting' several times. Yet somehow the interesting plot lines wound up unexplained or ignored, like they never happened. The lead character was irritating throughout the movie, and at one point my fella and I both shouted that we wanted her to die. There are some genuinely spooky/scary moments, but these are grossly overshadowed by the moments that just annoyed the hell out of me. It's another one of those horror movies that crops up and intrigues you for a while, but ultimately leaves you frustrated and a little confused about what the movie makers were trying to achieve.<br /><br />The one saving grace of this movie is the bad guy, but when the baddie is more likable than the lead character you know you're on to a loser.","finished_norm":["the","potenti","be","there","i","see","creep","and","think","oooh","thi","be","get","interest","sever","time","yet","somehow","the","interest","plot","line","wind","up","unexplain","or","ignor","like","thei","never","happen","the","lead","charact","be","irrit","throughout","the","movi","and","at","on","point","my","fella","and","i","both","shout","that","we","want","her","to","die","there","be","some","genuin","spookyscari","moment","but","thi","be","grossli","overshadow","by","the","moment","that","just","annoi","the","hell","out","of","me","it","anoth","on","of","that","horror","movi","that","crop","up","and","intrigu","you","for","a","while","but","ultim","leav","you","frustrat","and","a","littl","confus","about","what","the","movi","maker","be","try","to","achievebr","br","the","on","save","grace","of","thi","movi","be","the","bad","gui","but","when","the","baddi","be","much","likabl","than","the","lead","charact","you","know","you","re","on","to","a","loser"],"filtered":["potenti","see","creep","think","oooh","thi","get","interest","sever","time","yet","somehow","interest","plot","line","wind","unexplain","ignor","like","thei","never","happen","lead","charact","irrit","throughout","movi","point","fella","shout","want","die","genuin","spookyscari","moment","thi","grossli","overshadow","moment","annoi","hell","anoth","horror","movi","crop","intrigu","ultim","leav","frustrat","littl","confus","movi","maker","try","achievebr","br","save","grace","thi","movi","bad","gui","baddi","much","likabl","lead","charact","know","re","loser"],"filtered2":["potenti","see","creep","think","oooh","get","interest","sever","time","yet","somehow","interest","plot","line","wind","unexplain","ignor","like","never","happen","lead","charact","irrit","throughout","point","fella","shout","want","die","genuin","spookyscari","moment","grossli","overshadow","moment","annoi","hell","anoth","horror","crop","intrigu","ultim","leav","frustrat","littl","confus","maker","try","achievebr","save","grace","bad","gui","baddi","likabl","lead","charact","know","re","loser"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,8,9,10,12,14,26,32,36,37,42,55,60,66,68,73,74,83,94,107,157,188,189,194,271,293,316,394,427,438,547,549,735,762,763,959,1009,1017,1149,1166,1365,1438,1525,1969,2202,3448,3483,5020,5964,6043,7782],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,8,9,10,12,14,26,32,36,37,42,55,60,66,68,73,74,83,94,107,157,188,189,194,271,293,316,394,427,438,547,549,735,762,763,959,1009,1017,1149,1166,1365,1438,1525,1969,2202,3448,3483,5020,5964,6043,7782],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,1.9536997889255368,3.676353282473182,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,1.8950689206770979,1.9486336368009016,2.292318797740072,2.08112281984698,2.1439533986393955,4.672030138951541,5.075762444685391,2.498193474075453,2.5378812223426954,2.757740698455715,2.9012296278682137,2.878207028279898,3.0967381889441223,3.233054746047873,3.1797351085150902,3.432149042129413,3.4471119148061256,3.7132521434831514,3.749984152751882,3.7465885637507435,3.969732115064953,4.096025840389245,4.0536665665501035,4.297765483040301,4.246178114249808,4.422928625994308,4.513582994262438,4.6973654716960676,4.85885294158718,5.129498826886393,5.672363804397,5.672363804397,6.137727054086234,6.437831646536572,6.389041482367141,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.304519242625974E-5,7.255263161715751E-5,7.311665914548104E-5,7.269419031000059E-5,0.05112822834355032,7.259376770668844E-5,7.280967174317628E-5,7.256307872203729E-5,7.272622697538403E-5,8.068577886088245E-5,0.660164428742356,7.244594591458821E-5,7.379811356935139E-5,7.485085987552258E-5,7.249877274260029E-5,7.229841741501484E-5,7.410181099953274E-5,7.281649345982816E-5,7.259058057252968E-5,7.265074525743884E-5,7.335368382832337E-5,7.288863617881412E-5,7.297163094877833E-5,7.305024969669221E-5,7.361087283377532E-5,7.322590869190132E-5,7.630418678452865E-5,7.246748343005437E-5,7.246942210494609E-5,7.265302297603325E-5,0.04241888671826056,7.281227436583134E-5,0.13036241519485164,7.301708454896333E-5,7.254636102681967E-5,7.288121030601201E-5,7.247366776015049E-5,7.25164943655693E-5,7.229805418192019E-5,7.231681163270364E-5,7.24795879868096E-5,7.324409406025872E-5,0.11044311290767081,7.258379487710251E-5,7.34657640936162E-5,7.261165293420864E-5,7.502417758581037E-5,7.392092518611774E-5,7.233478631380583E-5,7.249465061513512E-5,7.246950673905346E-5,7.45090710746244E-5,7.249572919733137E-5,7.231039155234911E-5,7.310410158377904E-5,7.2514402172668

{"value":"Ugh! Where to begin ... first, Campbell Scott's non-stop angst becomes a real turn-off after awhile (a very short while) as he internalizes his mounting anguish, curiosity and anger. Only we don't care! These characters as presented by the writer and director are wholly unlikable, and therein lies the key. They haven't given us anything to make us care if they are adulterous and whether or not they are still in love with one another. When Scott quietly tells his wife, \"I could kill you\" before their three daughters at the dinner table, after the shock of his selfishly poor timing wore off I almost wished that he had--and then done the same thing to the smug, wisecracking apparition of Denis Leary before being hauled off the the looney bin.

{"value":"The opening scenes move as fluidly as frozen velveeta. The attempt at dramatic dialogue only makes me wish I had better control of the fast forward control. Vampires are usually portrayed as sexy and intelligent or mangy disgusting creatures. This vampire tries to seduce his prey by imitating a lost puppy. I usually tally a body count, so there was a cat (which doesn't count) a bum, a girl who fell out of the sky with a sword in her (whatever that was about) and then the plot. Foley artists are respected for using celery to create the sound of a broken arm, but using the sound of biting into an apple for a vampire biting a victim is just plain silly. I liked Warlock, but this movie just stunk so bad that we turned it off, and it was so forgettable we rented it a year later only to turn it off

{"value":"One of the silliest movies of the 1940s, an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring Kay Kyser. Kyer, orchestra leader and radio-star (and eternal college fraternity goof-off), was sort of the precursor to Spike Jones, hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians. He's hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion, the kind where poison darts imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall. The shindig is beset with a creepy judge, a scary professor, an ominous swami, lots of giggly females, and enough bad jokes to fill three Bob Hope pictures.

{"value":"\"Black Angel\" is minor whodunit, with June Vincent as a woman trying to save her husband from the electric chair after he is found guilty of killing an old acquaintance. Dan Duryea (the husband of the murdered woman) decides to help Vincent find the real culprit. Peter Lorre has one thankless role as a suspect. This film noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer, never achieving anything special. It is pleasant enough but then, at some point, it stops making sense and the solution to the mystery provokes one of those big \"give me a break\" reactions. That ending alone could have sank the film completely, but what precedes the conclusion is not very good either. Vincent is a wimpy heroine and Duryea was never very good at playing good guys.

{"value":"Let's just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand: This is a very dumb film with an even dumber script, lame animation, and a story that's about as original as thumbtacks. Don't bother -- unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children. They might laugh, especially if they're off their meds. There's a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous -- not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with claptrap that cost approximately zero effort, but they don't even bother to break a sweat inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing. This film, frankly, ticked me off royally.

{"value":"Hmmm...where to start? How does a serious actress like Demi Moore got involved in such crap? \"First blood\" might be rated as bull***t but this type of nonsense is just Rambo with tits, point. Of course if you are interested in the crapstory (Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the NAVY Seals) that is the most stupid cliché one I can think of, you'll say \"GI Jane\" is a great movie. Just the performance from Viggo Mortensen made this movie bearable but hell, I can't think of Demi Moore being Rambo (especially not during the last, useless, 30 minutes). Ridley Scott doesn't deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights, it's just brainless propaganda for the American army and to make it more attractive they dropped Moore in it.

{"value":"Look, there's nothing spectacularly offensive about this film, it's just boring. It's a typical rom-com with an ending you can see coming before you've seen so much as the trailer. The key difference is that the classic rom-coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension. This movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement, you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment. The production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago. I'd recommend re-watching a classic movie like When Harry Met Sally instead of this shallow imitation. Oh, one other BIG problem...no chemistry.

{"value":"I don't know what that other guy was thinking. The fact that this movie was independently made makes it no less terrible. You can be as big a believer as you want... the majority of this film is mindless drivel. I feel i have been insulted by having to watch the first 40 minutes of it. And that alone was no small feat. Not only is the acting terrible, but the plot is never even close to developed. There are countless holes in the story, to the point where you can hardly even call it a story anymore. I've never read the book, so I can't critique on that, but this is the first review that I've written here and it's purpose is solely to save all you viewers out there an hour and a half of your life. I can't remember the last time I couldn't even finish watching a movie.

{"value":"This is so bad, so very very bad. The acting is the biggest joke in history. Don't even bother to see it, i did ff it after 20 min and it was just as disappointing in the end as in the beginning... I really don't understand peoples taste, I'm a horror movie fan and I'm not fastidious but I DO HAVE A LIMIT! Maybe it was a quarter of a star better then the beginning of The Hoast but that's it. So I recommend you don't waste the 15 minutes you'll be able to watch. I mean the acting is better done by monkeys. And the big brother with the parental role is just awful. Don't they pay characters in C-movies? No I must say it's not the first time I think a horror movie is bad but it's absolutely one in my down ten movies and it will be charing places with Portrait of a vampire, Cabin by the lake, The

{"value":"There's hardly anything at all to recommend this movie. Chase Masterson is always nice to look at and actually can act, though her role in this clunker is a waste. Unfortunately the rest of the cast ranges from bad to mediocre. In a lot of films like this someone will shine through the material and you make a note of them for future reference. No such luck here. Creature Unknown\" a clichéd monster-on-the-loose flick with the kids getting knocked off one after the other. The monster is a man in a rubber suit which hearkens back to the days of Paul Blaisdell. So bad it's good! The rest of the show is just so bad it's bad. A little humor might have made this more palatable, but everyone plays the deadly dull material straight up. There is a twist or two at the end, but by then you won't care anymore.","finished_norm":["there","hardli","anyth","at","all","to","recommend","thi","movi","chase","masterson","be","alwai","nice","to","look","at","and","actual","can","act","though","her","role","in","thi","clunker","be","a","wast","unfortun","the","rest","of","the","cast","rang","from","bad","to","mediocr","in","a","lot","of","film","like","thi","someon","will","shine","through","the","materi","and","you","make","a","note","of","them","for","futur","refer","no","such","luck","here","creatur","unknown","a","clichéd","monsterontheloos","flick","with","the","kid","get","knock","off","on","after","the","other","the","monster","be","a","man","in","a","rubber","suit","which","hearken","back","to","the","dai","of","paul","blaisdel","so","bad","it","good","the","rest","of","the","show","be","just","so","bad","it","bad","a","littl","humor","mai","have","make","thi","much","palat","but","everyon","plai","the","deadli","dull","materi","straight","up","there","be","a","twist","or","two","at","the","end","but","by","then","you","wo","not","care","anymor"],"filtered":["hardli","anyth","recommend","thi","movi","chase","masterson","alwai","nice","look","actual","act","though","role","thi","clunker","wast","unfortun","rest","cast","rang","bad","mediocr","lot","film","like","thi","someon","shine","materi","make","note","futur","refer","luck","creatur","unknown","clichéd","monsterontheloos","flick","kid","get","knock","monster","man","rubber","suit","hearken","back","dai","paul","blaisdel","bad","good","rest","show","bad","bad","littl","humor","mai","make","thi","much","palat","everyon","plai","deadli","dull","materi","straight","twist","two","end","wo","care","anymor"],"filtered2":["hardli","anyth","recommend","chase","masterson","alwai","nice","look","actual","act","though","role","clunker","wast","unfortun","rest","cast","rang","bad","mediocr","lot","like","someon","shine","materi","make","note","futur","refer","luck","creatur","unknown","clichéd","monsterontheloos","flick","kid","get","knock","monster","man","rubber","suit","hearken","back","dai","paul","blaisdel","bad","good","rest","show","bad","bad","littl","humor","mai","make","palat","everyon","plai","deadli","dull","materi","straight","twist","two","end","wo","care","anymor"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,9,14,16,21,24,28,40,45,46,47,52,63,72,86,89,92,104,114,128,132,139,197,205,226,227,246,257,262,298,367,369,406,413,435,530,537,548,560,665,715,761,787,840,844,888,1352,1410,1511,1534,1553,1707,1794,1944,2625,5291,7716],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,9,14,16,21,24,28,40,45,46,47,52,63,72,86,89,92,104,114,128,132,139,197,205,226,227,246,257,262,298,367,369,406,413,435,530,537,548,560,665,715,761,787,840,844,888,1352,1410,1511,1534,1553,1707,1794,1944,2625,5291,7716],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,4.273428342688829,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.6284968758320737,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.7064694353107215,1.7122153074726136,1.8729627573220065,1.9209463754160525,2.031112399272319,1.9940046109572438,2.0489535369135887,2.0728240170322856,2.4433074195966826,2.3409902041158843,2.253494045787767,2.2939035841256437,2.558331832813986,2.571852579609833,5.188174963723441,2.6005321873043625,2.673149229007135,2.7602659523229094,2.726701583487816,2.7819920465008363,3.0791938792932125,3.121829110937649,3.121829110937649,3.467417180966871,3.2829611516442836,3.5784919978881358,6.849501469295936,3.459754308221302,3.4623020803001006,3.5929222627171646,3.68099128126493,3.9405024767500145,3.760240652919071,4.049068857301474,3.8690435127678695,3.9323057095458362,4.436351646326448,4.443131333311827,4.566029469634981,4.566029469634981,4.589376833631972,4.706176101378222,4.74221603786142,4.900964426937307,5.373120909544144,6.255510089742618,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.708284796787545E-5,6.663049264133845E-5,6.714848118617554E-5,6.676049654652509E-5,6.676159034209709E-5,6.666827098031377E-5,6.686655175929844E-5,6.664008699690213E-5,6.678991820566419E-5,0.08221589862307987,0.8655095154429162,6.653251520397285E-5,6.777431160697539E-5,6.874112705450697E-5,6.658103001999905E-5,6.639702878003332E-5,6.805321960708307E-5,6.687281665046838E-5,6.666534399731701E-5,6.672059771459446E-5,6.736615862990051E-5,6.693907068976892E-5,6.701529097683653E-5,6.708749243648844E-5,6.760235447494752E-5,6.724881319256282E-5,7.007582554521046E-5,6.655229471070877E-5,6.655407514044961E-5,6.672268951345359E-5,6.814086465911138E-5,6.686894194178806E-5,7.177814459135417E-5,6.70570344078485E-5,6.66247338905661E-5,6.693225095694782E-5,6.655797424226781E-5,6.659730

{"value":"A sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life: one as a \"happily\" married man with a ten year oldish child, the other as a sex fiend. The bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently probing him. Nastassja's role is very restrictive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes. If she had, I would have rated this movie a big fat \"F.\" As it is, it rates an F+, implying that it is still a failure unless one likes to be bored. It is probably a lot more interesting to spend ninety minutes cleaning out the garage. \"Diary of a Sex Addict\" falls into the category of films that once one has seen it, one wishes that one

{"value":"...but I've seen better too.<br /><br />The story here is predictable--a film crew trying to film a horror movie in a place where murders occurred. Three guesses what happens. This isn't a total bomb--the cast is fairly good with pros John Ireland, Faith Domergue and John Carradine giving the best performances. It's reasonably well-made--for a low budget film. Just don't expect any nudity, swearing, blood OR gore (the film has a very mild PG rating). I was never totally bored--it's OK viewing on a quiet night. I saw it on video--it was a HORRIBLE print--very dark and some scenes were impossible to see. Still I didn't hate it and it does have a cool ending which surprised me--basically nothing happens up till then so it catches you off guard.

{"value":"This movie has made me upset! When I think of Cat in the hat. Im thinking of cat in the hat books. You know, the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children. Well, I though that this movie would be a lot like that! But much to my suprise was nothing like the books! Insted it is more like young adult humor movie. In one part cat is talking to a gardening tool (hoe) cat talks to it like it is his hoe (agin adult humor). the naming of his car I all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie. under the rating you'll find: mild cude humor and some double-entendres. I think in short this means adult humor. I wish I could return this movie! wal-mart said they wouldn't because the movie has been opened.

{"value":"First of all, what is good in the movie ? Some pretty actress ? the exotic background ? the fact that the actors don't laugh while acting (I would have if I had been in their situation) ? I don't know. The storyline is simple : a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who (another abstract painter) killed his little brother, a male prostitute (raped by another priest when he was young...). I'm afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers, art or religion. Dennis Hopper is not very good here. This is the worst episode of the worst season of \"profiler\" (the serie) with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences (the uncle is the policeman who, the girl who lives at another victim's

{"value":"If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Alt&#305;oklar, as it is promised by the tag line, you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of Alt&#305;oklar regarding most famous issues like sex, marriage and cheating. To much nudity, which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that Alt&#305;oklar was unsuccessfully to \"try something new\" as he has quoted. To much sex centered jokes seems to show that Alt&#305;oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is \"sex sells.\" I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique. However in the end I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching Alt&#305;oklar's experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work.","finished_norm":["if","you","be","expect","to","see","a","lot","in","the","bath","of","altoklar","a","it","be","promis","by","the","tag","line","you","will","be","veri","disappoint","to","see","that","the","movi","consist","of","noth","but","the","populist","styl","of","altoklar","regard","much","famou","issu","like","sex","marriag","and","cheat","to","much","nuditi","which","seem","to","appear","from","nowher","and","have","no","connect","or","whatsoev","to","the","plot","prove","that","altoklar","be","unsuccessfulli","to","try","someth","new","a","he","have","quot","to","much","sex","center","joke","seem","to","show","that","altoklar","have","fall","for","the","famou","sai","which","be","sex","sell","i","be","hope","to","see","a","veri","good","stori","tell","with","a","veri","good","narrat","techniqu","howev","in","the","end","i","find","myself","sit","down","for","minut","and","watch","altoklar","experiment","yet","still","to","much","focu","on","popular","work"],"filtered":["expect","see","lot","bath","altoklar","promis","tag","line","veri","disappoint","see","movi","consist","noth","populist","styl","altoklar","regard","much","famou","issu","like","sex","marriag","cheat","much","nuditi","seem","appear","nowher","connect","whatsoev","plot","prove","altoklar","unsuccessfulli","try","someth","new","quot","much","sex","center","joke","seem","show","altoklar","fall","famou","sai","sex","sell","hope","see","veri","good","stori","tell","veri","good","narrat","techniqu","howev","end","find","sit","minut","watch","altoklar","experiment","yet","still","much","focu","popular","work"],"filtered2":["expect","see","lot","bath","altoklar","promis","tag","line","veri","disappoint","see","consist","noth","populist","styl","altoklar","regard","famou","issu","like","sex","marriag","cheat","nuditi","seem","appear","nowher","connect","whatsoev","plot","prove","altoklar","unsuccessfulli","try","someth","new","quot","sex","center","joke","seem","show","altoklar","fall","famou","sex","sell","hope","see","veri","good","stori","tell","veri","good","narrat","techniqu","howev","end","find","sit","minut","watch","altoklar","experiment","yet","still","focu","popular","work"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,15,17,24,28,32,35,36,38,48,49,53,59,64,72,87,90,107,113,130,169,170,181,187,194,214,244,254,380,540,612,619,683,767,799,806,828,861,865,951,992,1019,1214,1315,1404,1478,1604,1797,2519,3312,3775,8287],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,7,15,17,24,28,32,35,36,38,48,49,53,59,64,72,87,90,107,113,130,169,170,181,187,194,214,244,254,380,540,612,619,683,767,799,806,828,861,865,951,992,1019,1214,1315,1404,1478,1604,1797,2519,3312,3775,8287],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,1.357228929984541,0.9609497720722932,3.6001823395697077,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,2.926338025798268,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,1.883428577602134,1.9209463754160525,2.115024371522662,2.0477128419653545,2.1439533986393955,2.1521782565202803,2.2642139034199635,2.4214486257841834,2.4071371113909277,2.4442286541160034,2.4732161909892554,2.5378812223426954,2.7303758068497004,2.634508058031767,8.668956223577315,3.102062070196872,3.432149042129413,3.5929222627171646,3.5929222627171646,3.6105180246075443,3.79165684915245,3.7636829971100436,3.880604335168946,3.827761853794566,3.892300374932137,7.8402703478511615,4.004218291136122,4.004218291136122,4.091229668125752,4.456830177669989,4.4637506205145625,4.4919214974812585,4.597282013139085,4.637773374493822,4.798834931860927,5.2288713006995975,5.583416318380505,5.770002273960917,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.016194203313098E-5,6.968882365547853E-5,7.023058780768165E-5,6.982479472313736E-5,6.982593872378495E-5,6.972833601533785E-5,6.993571785649147E-5,6.96988583907245E-5,6.985556683263431E-5,7.750093813566442E-5,0.5496445485407998,6.9586349066381E-5,7.08851437640381E-5,0.11729574307652349,6.96370907062024E-5,6.944464383306602E-5,7.117685360536003E-5,6.994227030535768E-5,6.972527468419924E-5,6.97830645399697E-5,7.045825661798417E-5,7.001156539651259E-5,7.009128418492103E-5,7.016679968225397E-5,7.070529382183976E-5,7.03355250402151E-5,0.11740609486004147,6.960703644992373E-5,6.960889860115991E-5,6.978525235212654E-5,7.12685215539666E-5,6.993821774804893E-5,0.21032120703256577,7.013494363402982E-5,6.968280057878884E-5,7.000443263883504E-5,6.961297667124843E-5,6.965411281870815E-5,6.944429493756057E-5,6.946231199153556E-5,6.961866321386517E-5,7.035299259308426E-5,6.99954994731658E-5,6.971875683472277E-5,7.056591283484568E-5,6.97455152745723E-5,7.20628124044287E-5,7.100310774291672E-5,

{"value":"Check out the film's website, more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie. It couldn't be more off in it's boasting. Original story? Original? They must have found the script tucked away between the old testament, or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn-tooting. High-end special effects? Come on, I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a jug of earwax. Stylish cinematography? Oh yes, the America's funniest home video look is still a classic. I'm sure they had little money available for this title, so of course the sf aren't really that good, or a bit bad now and then, or just plain hilarious, but it's the story that makes this film a

{"value":"This is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for Fellini. About the only one more bizarre is his SATYRICON. This is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence, opulence and sexual challenge. Sutherland makes a curiously unappealing Casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography fail to engage the viewer. The art direction and costume design are however OUTSTANDING. The Academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an OSCAR for the latter. Also nominated (oddly) was the disjointed, pointless and almost inacessible screenplay. Go figure!! The film on video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes short of the original running time.

{"value":"Billy Crystal co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy-drama about fathers and sons, adult irresponsibility, and growing old. Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack (ha ha) which causes him to seek out his estranged father (Alan King), a movie-extra who fancies himself a big star. The script is sub-Neil Simon nonsense with one-liners galore, a flat, inexpressive direction by Henry Winkler (stuck in sitcom mode), and family-conflict at the ready. Crystal and King try their best, but King is over-eager and frequently over-the-top. JoBeth Williams has another one of her thankless roles, but manages to bring her innate, down-home class to the proverbial girlfriend character.
