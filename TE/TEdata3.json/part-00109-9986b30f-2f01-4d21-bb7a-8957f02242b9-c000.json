{"value":"It wasn't the most pointless animation film experience ever, but it certainly can't be admired as much as it tries to be good. Combining Dreamworks animation and computer graphics, this is the story of a mustang, later named Spirit (Matt Damon, providing the first person narration), and his journey through across the frontiers of the Old West. Basically he is born free amongst all the other horses in the beautiful countryside, then he is kidnapped to be used as a saddle horse, he manages to throw off all who try to ride him. However when he escapes his cage, along with Little Creek (Daniel Studi), the two of them form a friendship, oh, and he obviously has a thing for Little Creek's female horse. In the end, after a few more escapes, being chased by The Colonel (James Cromwell) and his men, and making a final big leap across a gorge, Little Creek lets Spirit go, and he also releases his female horse, and they run home to their countryside and fellow horses. Also starring Chopper Bernet as Sgt. Adams, Jeff LeBeau as Murphy/Railroad Foreman, John Rubano as Soldier, Richard McGonagle as Bill and Matthew Levin as Joe. I was expecting to see the horses talk in this film, but it turns out to be more like a Dumbo thing throughout, and the songs by Bryan Adams aren't the most engaging, but it isn't a terrible film. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Song for Bryan Adams' \"Here I Am\".

{"value":"Man I must say when I saw the trailer I was excited. Futuristic soldiers, taking on bad ass Vampires led by genre vet Michael Ironside....In Space. I mean I wasn't expecting high art, but It looked like a potential B movie classic. This was no doubt a TV pilot, reedited some time later into a feature film, after it wasn't picked up. Alright I'll start with the films few good points, the action was competent for a lower budgeted film, and the CGI and locations used were passable. Now onto the bad, first off Michael Ironside was barley in this, and his performance here....well it was cheesy not in a good way. But as I said he wasn't in it much anyways, so I can't blame him. One thing that was really stupid, was the PETA type group for Vampires', no I'm not joking, it's the dumbest most unbelievable thing I've seen in along time, and it's taken seriously. Also this film commits one of the major B movie sins, it teases a lesbian scene, and doesn't deliver. Most of all what sinks this film is nothing really happens. Since it was meant to be a pilot the script is almost nonexistent and it doesn't have a regular ending. Even the main villains, only come in towards the end. If ever a movie needed to up the Sleaze and gore factor, it's Vampire Wars. In closing I will say the main crew on the spaceship, were all very capable actors and could very well put this mess behind them, and go on to bigger and better things. They just had nothing to work with

{"value":"Considering John Doe apparently inspired Kyle XY's creator I was expecting its pilot to be quite interesting. However I probably had too high expectations because I was quite disappointed by it. First they turned the protagonist into a freak who had the crazy idea of showing off his amazing knowledge in front of an audience, in a public area. So after that scene I began to worry that it was just entertainment. But the problem is that it got worse as none of the other characters were properly introduced. They focused too much on John Doe which made the story far less intriguing. I was also slightly disappointed by Dominic Purcell's performance because I found he didn't make a believable John Doe. An other problem was the police story. It really felt like déjà vu and it wasn't a pleasant sensation. It leads us to the worst issue in the bunch, the episodic format. I could already see the fillers coming one after an other.<br /><br />So overall I was very disappointed by it and don't recommend it to anyone. Considering how bad it was I better understand now why the show got canceled. In some way I have the impression that it missed its target, developing characters to help the protagonist find his own identity. It's sad because there was potential, like the people he met at the club. The production quality was also quite good and the casting correct. But I'll never know if it got better, probably not, because I don't plan to watch the next episode.","finished_norm":["consid","john","doe","appar","inspir","kyl","xy","creator","i","be","expect","it","pilot","to","be","quit","interest","howev","i","probabl","have","too","high","expect","becaus","i","be","quit","disappoint","by","it","thei","turn","the","protagonist","into","a","freak","who","have","the","crazi","idea","of","show","off","hi","amaz","knowledg","in","front","of","a","audienc","in","a","public","area","so","after","that","scene","i","begin","to","worri","that","it","be","just","entertain","but","the","problem","be","that","it","get","wrong","a","none","of","the","other","charact","be","properli","introduc","thei","focu","too","much","on","john","doe","which","make","the","stori","far","littl","intrigu","i","be","conjur","slightli","disappoint","by","domin","purcel","perform","becaus","i","find","he","do","not","make","a","believ","john","doe","a","other","problem","be","the","polic","stori","it","realli","feel","like","déjà","vu","and","it","be","not","a","pleasant","sensat","it","lead","u","to","the","wrong","issu","in","the","bunch","the","episod","format","i","can","alreadi","see","the","filler","come","on","after","a","otherbr","br","so","overal","i","be","veri","disappoint","by","it","and","do","not","recommend","it","to","anyon","consid","how","bad","it","be","i","well","understand","now","why","the","show","get","cancel","in","some","wai","i","have","the","impress","that","it","miss","it","target","develop","charact","to","help","the","protagonist","find","hi","own","ident","it","sad","becaus","there","be","potenti","like","the","peopl","he","meet","at","the","club","the","product","qualiti","be","conjur","quit","good","and","the","cast","correct","but","i","will","never","know","if","it","get","well","probabl","not","becaus","i","do","not","plan","to","watch","the","next","episod"],"filtered":["consid","john","doe","appar","inspir","kyl","xy","creator","expect","pilot","quit","interest","howev","probabl","high","expect","becaus","quit","disappoint","thei","turn","protagonist","freak","crazi","idea","show","hi","amaz","knowledg","front","audienc","public","area","scene","begin","worri","entertain","problem","get","wrong","none","charact","properli","introduc","thei","focu","much","john","doe","make","stori","far","littl","intrigu","conjur","slightli","disappoint","domin","purcel","perform","becaus","find","make","believ","john","doe","problem","polic","stori","realli","feel","like","déjà","vu","pleasant","sensat","lead","u","wrong","issu","bunch","episod","format","alreadi","see","filler","come","otherbr","br","overal","veri","disappoint","recommend","anyon","consid","bad","well","understand","show","get","cancel","wai","impress","miss","target","develop","charact","help","protagonist","find","hi","ident","sad","becaus","potenti","like","peopl","meet","club","product","qualiti","conjur","quit","good","cast","correct","never","know","get","well","probabl","becaus","plan","watch","next","episod"],"filtered2":["consid","john","doe","appar","inspir","kyl","xy","creator","expect","pilot","quit","interest","howev","probabl","high","expect","becaus","quit","disappoint","turn","protagonist","freak","crazi","idea","show","amaz","knowledg","front","audienc","public","area","scene","begin","worri","entertain","problem","get","wrong","none","charact","properli","introduc","focu","john","doe","make","stori","far","littl","intrigu","conjur","slightli","disappoint","domin","purcel","perform","becaus","find","make","believ","john","doe","problem","polic","stori","realli","feel","like","déjà","vu","pleasant","sensat","lead","u","wrong","issu","bunch","format","alreadi","see","filler","come","otherbr","overal","veri","disappoint","recommend","anyon","consid","bad","well","understand","show","get","cancel","wai","impress","miss","target","develop","charact","help","protagonist","find","ident","sad","becaus","potenti","like","peopl","meet","club","product","qualiti","conjur","quit","good","cast","correct","never","know","get","well","probabl","becaus","plan","watch","next"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,10,13,14,15,17,18,19,20,22,23,25,26,28,33,34,38,39,42,43,60,91,92,96,101,105,112,113,120,123,130,147,148,157,158,167,168,185,187,190,195,211,212,255,291,297,298,308,317,319,320,330,350,370,412,418,419,455,471,547,581,619,685,712,773,780,806,909,929,965,1017,1035,1156,1271,1281,1314,1402,1429,1465,1608,1631,2080,2084,2264,2280,2312,2592,3223,4802,5254,5646,8278],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,7,9,10,13,14,15,17,18,19,20,22,23,25,26,28,33,34,38,39,4

{"value":"I notice that the previous reviewer (who appears to be still at school) gave this movie a very good review and I can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn't seen the far superior 1989 BBC adaptation of this classic novel. The major problem I had with this (1999) version was the casting of Anthony Way as Tom Long. Anthony Way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the TV mini-series \"The Choir\". I can only assume that he was cast for the role of Tom Long on the strength of his excellent acting in \"The Choir\". Unfortunately the small boy who appeared in \"The Choir\" had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time \"Tom's Midnight Garden\" was filmed and as such Anthony fails to convince as schoolboy Tom. It is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that Tom (as played by Anthony) would befriend the far younger Hatty. In the 1989 BBC version Tom and Hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable. For a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 TV effects. The casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic. As a final observation I would point out that the VHS of the 1989 BBC version fetches well over £20.00 second hand whereas a new DVD of this version can be bought for under £5.00, need I say

{"value":"I was interested in the title and description of Big Rig while attending the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. However, I was eager to get the heck out of the seats as soon as Big Rig ended. Big Rig is comprised of several \"big rig\" drivers who set out to deliver goods driven across the United States. The characters are all wonderful people, however the filmmakers never dug deep into the complexity of them as people. Instead, the story meanders as much as the maps in the film are meant to guide, but never do. At most, we get lost. We - the audience - end up going nowhere and, like the direction of the storytelling, end up somewhere but without direction, location, or plot. Why are we here? Where are we? How did we get here? The storytelling is sloppy and the directors' intent on \"humanizing\" a group of people who they regard as \"overlooked\" and \"invisible\" comes across as unconsciously and irritatingly condescending. The problem here here lies in the perspective of the directors instead of the truck drivers. The directors bring their own naive assumptions about truckers forward and then simply edit the film to confirm those assumptions. Overall, the story lacks any tension, the film is entirely too long (should have been a 15 min sketch), the big question of \"So what\" is never answered, and the entire film is one piece of

{"value":"OK, I kinda like the idea of this movie. I'm in the age demographic, and I kinda identify with some of the stories. Even the sometimes tacky and meaningless dialogue seems semi-realistic, and in a different movie would have been forgivable.<br /><br />I'm trying as hard as possible not to trash this movie like the others did, but it's not that easy when the filmmakers weren't trying at all.<br /><br />The editing in this movie is terrible! Possibly the worst editing I've ever seen in a movie! There are things that you don't have to go to film school to learn, leaning good editing is not one of them, but identifying a bad one is.<br /><br />Also, the shot... Oh my God the shots, just awful! I can't even go into the details, but we sometimes just see random things popping up, and that, in conjunction with the editing will give you the most painful film viewing experience.<br /><br />This movie being made on low or no budget with 4 cast and crew is not an excuse also. I've seen short films on youtube with a lot more artistic integrity! Joe, Greta, I don't know what the heck you were thinking, but this movie is nothing but a masturbation of both your egos. You should be ashamed of yourselves! In conclusion, this movie is like what a really lazy amateur porn movie will be if it was filled with 3 or 4 lousy sex scenes separated by long boring conversations and one disgusting masturbation scene. If that's not your kind of thing, avoid this at all

{"value":"Notorious for more than a quarter century (and often banned), it's obscurity was its greatest asset it seems. Hey, it's often better to be talked about, rather than actually seen when you can't back the \"legend\" up with substance.<br /><br />The film has played in Los Angeles a couple of times recently, and is available on home video, so that veil is slowly being lifted. While there is still plenty to offend the masses, it is more likely to bore them, than arouse much real passion. Except for a gratuitous and protracted XXX sex scene between a pair of horses (\"Nature Documentary\" anyone?), there follows nearly an hour of a dull arranged marriage melodrama. <br /><br />Once the sex and nudity begins, it is a nonstop sequence involving masturbation, a looooooooong flashback to an alleged 'beauty and the beast' encounter, and a naked woman running around the mansion (nobody, even her supposedly protective Aunt, seems to even think of putting some clothes on her!). On video, I guess you can fast-forward thru the banality, but it's not really worth the effort. The nudity doesn't go beyond what is seen in something much more substantive such as Bertolucci's THE DREAMERS.<br /><br />Try as one might to find some 'moral' or 'symbolism' in the carnality, I doubt it's worthy of anyone's effort. Unfortunately, for LA BETE, now that you can more easily see the film, the notoriety of something once 'forbidden' has been lifted.

{"value":"\"A young woman suffers from the delusion that she is a werewolf, based upon a family legend of an ancestor accused of and killed for allegedly being one. Due to her past treatment by men, she travels the countryside seducing and killing the men she meets. Falling in love with a kind man, her life appears to take a turn for the better when she is raped and her lover is killed by a band of thugs. Traumatized again by these latest events, the woman returns to her violent ways and seeks revenge on the thugs,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />Rino Di Silvestro's \"La lupa mannara\" begins with full frontal, writhing, moaning dance by shapely blonde Annik Borel, who (as Daniella Neseri) mistakenly believes she is a werewolf. The hottest part is when the camera catches background fire between her legs. The opening \"flashback\" reveals her hairy ancestor was (probably) a lycanthropic creature. Ms. Borel is, unfortunately, not a werewolf; she is merely a very strong lunatic.<br /><br />As a film, \"Werewolf Woman\" (in English) would have been better if Borel's character really was a female werewolf; with her sexual victimization a great bit of characterization. But, as far as 1970s skin and blood flicks go, this one is hard to beat. Bouncy Borel is either nude or sexily clad throughout the film, which features a fair amount of gratuitous gore. Dazzling Dagmar Lassander (as Elena) and hunky Howard Ross (as Luca) are good supporting players.","finished_norm":["a","young","woman","suffer","from","the","delus","that","she","be","a","werewolf","base","upon","a","famili","legend","of","a","ancestor","accus","of","and","kill","for","allegedli","be","on","due","to","her","past","treatment","by","man","she","travel","the","countrysid","seduc","and","kill","the","man","she","meet","fall","in","love","with","a","kind","man","her","life","appear","to","take","a","turn","for","the","well","when","she","be","rape","and","her","lover","be","kill","by","a","band","of","thug","traumat","again","by","thi","late","event","the","woman","return","to","her","violent","wai","and","seek","reveng","on","the","thug","accord","to","the","dvd","sleev","synopsisbr","br","rino","di","silvestro","la","lupa","mannara","begin","with","full","frontal","writh","moan","danc","by","shape","blond","annik","borel","who","a","daniella","neseri","mistakenli","believ","she","be","a","werewolf","the","hot","part","be","when","the","camera","catch","background","fire","between","her","leg","the","open","flashback","reveal","her","hairi","ancestor","be","probabl","a","lycanthrop","creatur","m","borel","be","unfortun","not","a","werewolf","she","be","mere","a","veri","strong","lunaticbr","br","a","a","film","werewolf","woman","in","english","would","have","be","well","if","borel","charact","realli","be","a","femal","werewolf","with","her","sexual","victim","a","great","bite","of","character","but","a","far","a","skin","and","blood","flick","go","thi","on","be","hard","to","beat","bounci","borel","be","either","nude","or","sexili","cloth","throughout","the","film","which","featur","a","fair","amount","of","gratuit","gore","dazzl","dagmar","lassand","a","elena","and","hunki","howard","ross","a","luca","be","good","support","player"],"filtered":["young","woman","suffer","delus","werewolf","base","upon","famili","legend","ancestor","accus","kill","allegedli","due","past","treatment","man","travel","countrysid","seduc","kill","man","meet","fall","love","kind","man","life","appear","take","turn","well","rape","lover","kill","band","thug","traumat","thi","late","event","woman","return","violent","wai","seek","reveng","thug","accord","dvd","sleev","synopsisbr","br","rino","di","silvestro","la","lupa","mannara","begin","full","frontal","writh","moan","danc","shape","blond","annik","borel","daniella","neseri","mistakenli","believ","werewolf","hot","part","camera","catch","background","fire","leg","open","flashback","reveal","hairi","ancestor","probabl","lycanthrop","creatur","m","borel","unfortun","werewolf","mere","veri","strong","lunaticbr","br","film","werewolf","woman","english","well","borel","charact","realli","femal","werewolf","sexual","victim","great","bite","character","far","skin","blood","flick","go","thi","hard","beat","bounci","borel","either","nude","sexili","cloth","throughout","film","featur","fair","amount","gratuit","gore","dazzl","dagmar","lassand","elena","hunki","howard","ross","luca","good","support","player"],"filtered2":["young","woman","suffer","delus","werewolf","base","upon","famili","legend","ancestor","accus","kill","allegedli","due","past","treatment","man","travel","countrysid","seduc","kill","man","meet","fall","love","kind","man","life","appear","take","turn","well","rape","lover","kill","band","thug","traumat","late","event","woman","return","violent","wai","seek","reveng","thug","accord","dvd","sleev","synopsisbr","rino","di","silvestro","la","lupa","mannara","begin","full","frontal","writh","moan","danc","shape","blond","annik","borel","daniella","neseri","mistakenli","believ","werewolf","hot","part","camera","catch","background","fire","leg","open","flashback","reveal","hairi","ancestor","probabl","lycanthrop","creatur","m","borel","unfortun","werewolf","mere","veri","strong","lunaticbr","werewolf","woman","english","well","borel","charact","realli","femal","werewolf","sexual","victim","great","bite","character","far","skin","blood","flick","go","hard","beat","bounci","borel","either","nude","sexili","cloth","throughout","featur","fair","amount","gratuit","gore","dazzl","dagmar","lassand","elena","hunki","howard","ross","luca","good","support","player"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,10,13,15,20,31,33,45,51,54,61,70,75,76,91,96,101,122,135,147,148,150,154,169,170,171,182,207,227,231,242,247,257,305,334,336,350,355,358,422,438,440,458,470,488,492,512,519,535,551,568,588,630,631,633,666,678,746,761,766,772,801,833,836,871,877,879,927,954,962,966,985,999,1032,1051,1221,1238,1320,1377,1378,1379,1617,1816,1867,2037,2049,2052,2053,2195,2660,3949,3958,4012,4506,4635,4737,4916,5091,5097,5250,5509,5583,5593,6101,6172,7747,8428],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"Have not watched kids films for some years, so I missed \"Here Come the Tigers\" when it first came out. (Never even saw \"Bad News Bears\" even though in the '70s I worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie, \"Warriors,\" \"Man Who Would Be King,\" and \"Rocky Horror Picture Show,\" among others.) Now I like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on. Just minutes into this movie I could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things--at least watching for his/her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren't doing the job. Lo and behold, I spied Wes Craven's name in the credits as an electrical gaffer. He'd already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created Freddie Krueger or made the \"Scream\" movies. Maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic. More surprising was Fred J. Lincoln in the cast credits as \"Aesop,\" a wacky character in the movie. F.J. Lincoln, from the '70s to just a few years ago, appeared in and produced adult films. He was associated with the adult spoof \"The Ozporns,\" and just that title is funnier than all of \"Tigers\" attempts at humor combined. Let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel.","finished_norm":["have","not","watch","kid","film","for","some","year","so","i","miss","here","come","the","tiger","when","it","come","out","never","even","see","bad","new","bear","even","though","in","the","i","work","for","the","gui","who","arrang","financ","for","that","movi","warrior","man","who","would","be","king","and","rocki","horror","pictur","show","among","other","now","i","like","to","check","out","old","or","small","movi","and","find","peopl","who","have","go","on","to","great","career","despit","be","in","a","littl","than","great","movi","earli","on","just","minut","into","thi","movi","i","can","take","no","much","and","jump","to","the","end","credit","to","see","if","there","be","a","young","actor","in","thi","movi","who","have","go","on","to","big","and","well","thingsat","littl","watch","for","hisher","appear","would","creat","some","interest","a","the","plot","and","act","be","not","do","the","job","lo","and","behold","i","spy","we","craven","name","in","the","credit","a","a","electr","gaffer","he","have","alreadi","make","two","or","three","of","hi","earli","shocker","but","have","not","yet","creat","freddi","krueger","or","make","the","scream","movi","mayb","he","ow","a","favor","and","help","out","on","thi","pic","much","surpris","be","fred","j","lincoln","in","the","cast","credit","a","aesop","a","wacki","charact","in","the","movi","fj","lincoln","from","the","to","just","a","few","year","ago","appear","in","and","produc","adult","film","he","be","associ","with","the","adult","spoof","the","ozporn","and","just","that","titl","be","funni","than","all","of","tiger","attempt","at","humor","combin","let","the","fact","that","a","adult","actor","be","place","in","a","kid","movi","be","a","indic","a","to","how","the","peopl","make","thi","movi","must","have","be","asleep","at","the","wheel"],"filtered":["watch","kid","film","year","miss","come","tiger","come","never","even","see","bad","new","bear","even","though","work","gui","arrang","financ","movi","warrior","man","king","rocki","horror","pictur","show","among","like","check","old","small","movi","find","peopl","go","great","career","despit","littl","great","movi","earli","minut","thi","movi","take","much","jump","end","credit","see","young","actor","thi","movi","go","big","well","thingsat","littl","watch","hisher","appear","creat","interest","plot","act","job","lo","behold","spy","craven","name","credit","electr","gaffer","alreadi","make","two","three","hi","earli","shocker","yet","creat","freddi","krueger","make","scream","movi","mayb","ow","favor","help","thi","pic","much","surpris","fred","j","lincoln","cast","credit","aesop","wacki","charact","movi","fj","lincoln","year","ago","appear","produc","adult","film","associ","adult","spoof","ozporn","titl","funni","tiger","attempt","humor","combin","let","fact","adult","actor","place","kid","movi","indic","peopl","make","thi","movi","must","asleep","wheel"],"filtered2":["watch","kid","year","miss","come","tiger","come","never","even","see","bad","new","bear","even","though","work","gui","arrang","financ","warrior","man","king","rocki","horror","pictur","show","among","like","check","old","small","find","peopl","go","great","career","despit","littl","great","earli","minut","take","jump","end","credit","see","young","actor","go","big","well","thingsat","littl","watch","hisher","appear","creat","interest","plot","act","job","lo","behold","spy","craven","name","credit","electr","gaffer","alreadi","make","two","three","earli","shocker","yet","creat","freddi","krueger","make","scream","mayb","ow","favor","help","pic","surpris","fred","j","lincoln","cast","credit","aesop","wacki","charact","fj","lincoln","year","ago","appear","produc","adult","associ","adult","spoof","ozporn","titl","funni","tiger","attempt","humor","combin","let","fact","adult","actor","place","kid","indic","peopl","make","must","asleep","wheel"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,7,9,10,14,20,21,23,24,28,31,32,34,38,41,42,45,47,48,51,55,57,59,60,62,67,82,83,86,87,92,97,114,124,135,141,143,163,164,169,177,185,194,224,255,261,264,266,289,311,326,330,356,362,363,369,391,504,511,525,526,541,610,674,734,826,968,1115,1136,1346,1419,1496,1548,1742,1747,1775,2172,2311,2384,2628,2923,2984,3085,3243,3658,3673,3971,4392,4942,5602,6014,6363,6833],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,7,9,10,14,20,21,23,24,28,31,32,34,38,41,42,45,47,48,51,55,57,59,60,62,67,82,83,86,87,92,97,114,124,135,141,143,163,164,169,177,185,194,224,255,261,264,266,289,311,326,330,356,362,363,369,391,504,511,525,526,541,610,674,734,

{"value":"Brides are dying at the altar, and their corpses are disappearing. Everybody is concerned, but nobody seems to be able to figure out why and how this is happening, nor can they prevent it from happening. Bear with me. Bela Lugosi is responsible for this, as he is extracting spinal fluid from these young women to transfuse his ancient wife and keep her alive. Continue to bear with me. Finally, the authorities figure out that somebody must be engineering the deaths and disappearances, but of course, they can't figure out the improbable motive. Let's just ignore the ludicrous pseudoscience and move on... If you can get through the first twenty minutes of this mess, you will be treated to Lugosi whipping his lab assistant for disrespecting one of the brides he has murdered, explaining that he finds sleeping in a coffin much more comfortable than a bed, and other vague parodies of real horror films (the kind with budgets and plots). Anyhoo - a female journalist follows her nose to the culprit (and remarkably the inept police are nowhere to be seen!), and then the fun really starts.<br /><br />The cinematography and acting are OK. There are a lot of well dressed, very good looking people in this film. The directing is fair, and the script is a little better than the material deserved. Nevertheless, this film fails to sustain the interest of all but the most hardened b-film fan. The best thing about it.... It does eventually end, but not soon

{"value":"\"Gone With The Wind\" is one of the most overrated movies in history. It is a film loved by mothers, grandmothers, and shut-ins who go to the movies once every five years. As a zombie movie, it blows. There isn't a shambling corpse in sight, and it's terribly light in the gore department. \"Zombie 3\", on the other hand, is big on shambling corpses and quite generous with its blood-spilling -- therefore, it is better than \"Gone With the Wind\". It is also not overrated. Most reviewers are under no delusions that it is rubbish. It is, however, not boring rubbish. After a terrorist steals a virus, he drops it while being pursued by a helicopter, and the chemicals leak into the ground. The terrorist, who has been exposed to the nasty concoction, hides in a hotel room where he slowly morphs into a flesh-eating zombie. One of his first victim's is a cleaning lady. Once she's bitten, Lucio Fulci's brand of hell breaks loose. As usual for a Fulci flick, the acting is atrocious, the storyline is riddled with plot holes, and the gore is plentiful. Turns out the film was directed by Fulci and Bruno Mattei, so that explains its rather schizophrenic nature. It is badly shot, too, poorly edited, and the sound design is flat. Still, it is saved by its gleeful adherence to the goriest of murders and its impatient pacing. Definitely worth picking up if you're an undead completest. Or don't like \"Gone With The Wind\", undoubtedly the worst zombie movie of all time.","finished_norm":["go","with","the","wind","be","on","of","the","much","overr","movi","in","histori","it","be","a","film","love","by","mother","grandmoth","and","shutin","who","go","to","the","movi","onc","everi","five","year","a","a","zombi","movi","it","blow","there","be","not","a","shambl","corps","in","sight","and","it","terribli","light","in","the","gore","depart","zombi","on","the","other","hand","be","big","on","shambl","corps","and","quit","gener","with","it","bloodspil","therefor","it","be","well","than","go","with","the","wind","it","be","conjur","not","overr","much","review","be","under","no","delus","that","it","be","rubbish","it","be","howev","not","bore","rubbish","after","a","terrorist","steal","a","viru","he","drop","it","while","be","pursu","by","a","helicopt","and","the","chemic","leak","into","the","grind","the","terrorist","who","have","be","expos","to","the","nasti","concoct","hide","in","a","hotel","room","where","he","slowli","morph","into","a","flesheat","zombi","on","of","hi","victim","be","a","clean","ladi","onc","she","bite","lucio","fulci","brand","of","hell","break","loos","a","usual","for","a","fulci","flick","the","act","be","atroci","the","storylin","be","riddl","with","plot","hole","and","the","gore","be","plenti","turn","out","the","film","be","direct","by","fulci","and","bruno","mattei","so","that","explain","it","rather","schizophren","natur","it","be","badli","shoot","too","poorli","edit","and","the","sound","design","be","flat","still","it","be","save","by","it","gleeful","adher","to","the","gori","of","murder","and","it","impati","pace","definit","worth","pick","up","if","you","re","a","undead","complet","or","do","not","like","go","with","the","wind","undoubtedli","the","wrong","zombi","movi","of","all","time"],"filtered":["go","wind","much","overr","movi","histori","film","love","mother","grandmoth","shutin","go","movi","onc","everi","five","year","zombi","movi","blow","shambl","corps","sight","terribli","light","gore","depart","zombi","hand","big","shambl","corps","quit","gener","bloodspil","therefor","well","go","wind","conjur","overr","much","review","delus","rubbish","howev","bore","rubbish","terrorist","steal","viru","drop","pursu","helicopt","chemic","leak","grind","terrorist","expos","nasti","concoct","hide","hotel","room","slowli","morph","flesheat","zombi","hi","victim","clean","ladi","onc","bite","lucio","fulci","brand","hell","break","loos","usual","fulci","flick","act","atroci","storylin","riddl","plot","hole","gore","plenti","turn","film","direct","fulci","bruno","mattei","explain","rather","schizophren","natur","badli","shoot","poorli","edit","sound","design","flat","still","save","gleeful","adher","gori","murder","impati","pace","definit","worth","pick","re","undead","complet","like","go","wind","undoubtedli","wrong","zombi","movi","time"],"filtered2":["go","wind","overr","histori","love","mother","grandmoth","shutin","go","onc","everi","five","year","zombi","blow","shambl","corps","sight","terribli","light","gore","depart","zombi","hand","big","shambl","corps","quit","gener","bloodspil","therefor","well","go","wind","conjur","overr","review","delus","rubbish","howev","bore","rubbish","terrorist","steal","viru","drop","pursu","helicopt","chemic","leak","grind","terrorist","expos","nasti","concoct","hide","hotel","room","slowli","morph","flesheat","zombi","victim","clean","ladi","onc","bite","lucio","fulci","brand","hell","break","loos","usual","fulci","flick","act","atroci","storylin","riddl","plot","hole","gore","plenti","turn","direct","fulci","bruno","mattei","explain","rather","schizophren","natur","badli","shoot","poorli","edit","sound","design","flat","still","save","gleeful","adher","gori","murder","impati","pace","definit","worth","pick","re","undead","complet","like","go","wind","undoubtedli","wrong","zombi","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,8,20,21,25,32,39,54,57,64,68,82,85,96,102,103,108,113,117,120,154,160,176,178,189,219,225,235,236,257,265,268,273,348,353,358,360,392,394,395,397,398,446,448,456,472,499,505,513,515,535,546,578,594,681,707,754,810,887,904,940,1009,1052,1064,1098,1153,1219,1228,1276,1280,1374,1488,1495,1575,1739,1791,1822,2069,2111,2168,2372,2463,2551,2896,3547,3699,3982,4288,4605,4631,5347,5577,5826,6047,6101,6338,6405,6413,8118,8383],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,6,8,20,21,25,32,39,54,57,64,68,82,85,96,102,103,108,113,117,120,154,160,176,178,189,219,225,235,236,257,265,268,273,348,353,358,360,392,394,395,397,398,446,448,456,472,499,505,513,515,535,546,578,594,681,707,

{"value":"Wow, I just saw this on T.V. as one of the \"scary\" movies they show around Halloween. Was this rated G? There wasn't really anything to make this movie scary, or worth watching. Also, other people say this is a spoof, but I don't think so. For a spoof, you need something called \"humor\". This low-budget crap-fest didn't have a shred of humor, and it didn't make much sense, either. You basically have a goofy looking monster (man in rubber suit) coming out of closets, killing people, I guess, since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath. The spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster, so I guess that's good enough.<br /><br />The military tries feebly to kill the monster, which isn't much larger than a man. They have very bad aim. Then the military FLEES! Wow, did this movie make the U.S. military look pathetic or what? The monster, while hard to kill, doesn't do much besides shuffle around and roar. Oh, and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks. It was a slightly interesting, yet a total Alien ripoff.<br /><br />What was the deal with the scientist playing the Xylophone to attract the monster? It was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality. Also, why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long?

{"value":"The proverb \"Never judge a book by it's cover\", was coined as a warning to those who fail to look beneath the surface. <br /><br />As I viewed the artwork to,\"King of the Ants\" I instantly thought HORROR! The arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover & back spoke of a dark vision, the synopsis promised a story of murder, betrayal, & retribution. Instead what I discovered beneath that surface, was less interesting than what you can find under your average rock.<br /><br />\"King of the Ants\" features Chris L. McKenna as Sean Crawley, an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world, even if it means murder. Except Sean Crawley is someone you don't care about, never once did I feel any compassion or sympathy for this character. In fact he's downright unlikable, but not as much as Daniel Baldwin (Ray Mathews)who turns in an uninspired performance as a made all the worst by the utterly laughable dialogue he is forced to recite. Throw in Kari Wuhrer as a grieving widow who apparently has unconditional trust (esp. in the homeless), and little to no common sense, and George Wendt as Duke, which is basically a sober Norm from Cheers but MEAN!<br /><br />Now there are a couple of interesting \"hallucination\" sequences in this film (the source of the cover images) but this film never delves further into that world.

{"value":"An older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to be wilting. He gets pricked by it, or bitten by something on it. He quickly becomes ill, and at the hospital spits out a large writhing white larva of some kind. A later attempt to resuscitate him with paddles results in a splatter of blood.<br /><br />A cop is at the hospital because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot-out. Somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors, as well as an entomologist who is brought in. There are several young kids wandering around the hospital, who I suppose we're supposed to find adorable, but who are extremely annoying little brats. They happen to wander into the room where the specimen is being kept, and happen to dump a growth hormone on it. Horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this, but they're never even in any danger.<br /><br />The critter grows and starts breeding. People run away from it, and sometimes towards it for some reason. The hospital gets surrounded by military who are prepared to destroy everything if need be.<br /><br />There are no really compelling characters in the movie, and most of the time it seems like people are searching around for the monster. It was fairly boring. Clearly it owes something to the Alien movies, with the monster being born inside a human and having several stages of its growth. There's also a character named Bishop, and the lead actress has Sigourney Weaver's hair.","finished_norm":["a","old","man","touch","a","flower","in","hi","wife","greenhous","that","seem","to","be","wilt","he","get","prick","by","it","or","bite","by","someth","on","it","he","quickli","becom","ill","and","at","the","hospit","spit","out","a","larg","writh","white","larva","of","some","kind","a","late","attempt","to","resuscit","him","with","paddl","result","in","a","splatter","of","bloodbr","br","a","cop","be","at","the","hospit","becaus","hi","partner","get","badli","hurt","in","a","shootout","somehow","the","cop","get","pair","up","with","on","of","the","femal","doctor","a","good","a","a","entomologist","who","be","bring","in","there","be","sever","young","kid","wander","around","the","hospit","who","i","suppos","we","re","suppos","to","find","ador","but","who","be","extrem","annoi","littl","brat","thei","happen","to","wander","into","the","room","where","the","specimen","be","be","keep","and","happen","to","dump","a","growth","hormon","on","it","horror","movi","logic","would","sai","thei","deserv","to","die","for","thi","but","thei","re","never","even","in","ani","dangerbr","br","the","critter","grow","and","start","bre","peopl","run","awai","from","it","and","sometim","toward","it","for","some","reason","the","hospit","get","surround","by","militari","who","be","prepar","to","destroi","everyth","if","ne","bebr","br","there","be","no","realli","compel","charact","in","the","movi","and","much","of","the","time","it","seem","like","peopl","be","search","around","for","the","monster","it","be","fairli","bore","clearli","it","ow","someth","to","the","alien","movi","with","the","monster","be","bear","insid","a","human","and","have","sever","stage","of","it","growth","there","conjur","a","charact","name","bishop","and","the","lead","actress","have","sigournei","weaver","hair"],"filtered":["old","man","touch","flower","hi","wife","greenhous","seem","wilt","get","prick","bite","someth","quickli","becom","ill","hospit","spit","larg","writh","white","larva","kind","late","attempt","resuscit","paddl","result","splatter","bloodbr","br","cop","hospit","becaus","hi","partner","get","badli","hurt","shootout","somehow","cop","get","pair","femal","doctor","good","entomologist","bring","sever","young","kid","wander","around","hospit","suppos","re","suppos","find","ador","extrem","annoi","littl","brat","thei","happen","wander","room","specimen","keep","happen","dump","growth","hormon","horror","movi","logic","sai","thei","deserv","die","thi","thei","re","never","even","ani","dangerbr","br","critter","grow","start","bre","peopl","run","awai","sometim","toward","reason","hospit","get","surround","militari","prepar","destroi","everyth","ne","bebr","br","realli","compel","charact","movi","much","time","seem","like","peopl","search","around","monster","fairli","bore","clearli","ow","someth","alien","movi","monster","bear","insid","human","sever","stage","growth","conjur","charact","name","bishop","lead","actress","sigournei","weaver","hair"],"filtered2":["old","man","touch","flower","wife","greenhous","seem","wilt","get","prick","bite","someth","quickli","becom","ill","hospit","spit","larg","writh","white","larva","kind","late","attempt","resuscit","paddl","result","splatter","bloodbr","cop","hospit","becaus","partner","get","badli","hurt","shootout","somehow","cop","get","pair","femal","doctor","good","entomologist","bring","sever","young","kid","wander","around","hospit","suppos","re","suppos","find","ador","extrem","annoi","littl","brat","happen","wander","room","specimen","keep","happen","dump","growth","hormon","horror","logic","deserv","die","re","never","even","ani","dangerbr","critter","grow","start","bre","peopl","run","awai","sometim","toward","reason","hospit","get","surround","militari","prepar","destroi","everyth","ne","bebr","realli","compel","charact","time","seem","like","peopl","search","around","monster","fairli","bore","clearli","ow","someth","alien","monster","bear","insid","human","sever","stage","growth","conjur","charact","name","bishop","lead","actress","sigournei","weaver","hair"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,8,10,13,14,22,23,27,35,38,39,42,45,53,67,68,71,83,94,95,98,108,110,114,115,122,134,135,137,143,149,150,154,155,157,177,193,250,263,271,292,293,316,329,354,359,413,422,423,447,448,476,494,500,513,525,549,561,563,564,565,669,693,738,745,771,813,819,863,891,973,984,1089,1143,1242,1254,1275,1295,1442,1489,1513,2166,2215,2394,2628,2720,3005,3192,3273,3430,3592,5322,5393,6044,6167,6172,6271,8469],"values":[1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,8,10,13

{"value":"Some people seem to think this was the worst movie they have ever seen, and I understand where they're coming from, but I really have seen worse.<br /><br />That being said, the movies that I can recall (ie the ones I haven't blocked out) that were worse than this, were so bad that they physically pained every sense that was involved with watching the movie. The movies that are worse than War Games 2 are the ones that make you want to gouge out your eyes, or stab sharp objects in your ears to keep yourself from having another piece of your soul ripped away from you by the awfulness.<br /><br />War Games: The Dead Code isn't that bad, but it comes pretty close. Yes I was a fan of the original, but no I wasn't expecting miracles from this one. Let's face it the original wasn't really that great of a movie in the first place, it was basically just a campy 80s teen romance flick with some geek-appeal to it.<br /><br />That's all I was hoping for, something bad, but that might have tugged at my geek-strings. Was that too much to ask for? Is it really not possible to do better than the original War Games, even for a straight to video release? Well apparently that was too much to ask for. Stay away from this movie. At first it's just bad, like \"Oh yeah, this is bad, but I'm kind of enjoying it, maybe the end will be good like in the original.\" And then it just gets worse and worse, and by the end, trust me,

{"value":"Camp Blood III is a vast improvement on Camp Blood II as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot. This time they've ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness.<br /><br />This time around there's a reality TV show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants. This is hardly a new idea, I've seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife.<br /><br />Unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs. I liked how there's a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantom.<br /><br />I don't know why anyone would want to make a third Camp Blood film, I would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one. The half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me, it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for $5 just like they did in the second movie. They still haven't worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well, it's a Camp Blood movie what do you expect?

{"value":"My grandmother took me and my sister out to see this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1998, and so we happily bought the tickets, the popcorn and soda, and walked right in to the theater and sat down to watch the movie. When it was over, the audience didn't applauded strongly, I remember that I heard a few people say that they didn't like it at all, I didn't like it, I thought that it was rather stupid, and not worth seeing. Eddie Murphy was hysterical in this, but apart from him, the whole movie was bad, I rarely laughed at the parts in this, I also remembered that the other people in the theater almost hardly even laughed. And what I really thought was bad was making the animals talk, because talking animals only exist in cartoons, in live action movies, they are totally a mutt! I said that apart from Eddie Murphy's hysterical twist he brings in, this movie is not worth watching, it is rather stupid.<br /><br />I have seen Eddie Murphy in several of movies and I thought that he was funny in those, I have just said that he was the only funny part of this movie, I also have not seen Eddie Murphy in the really \"great\" movie, The Adventures of Pluto Nash. This movie is not a movie that I would really recommend that you see, because apart from Eddie Murphy, you probably are not going to like this, especially because of a lot the the talking animals in it! <br /><br />I'll give this movie a rating of 3 stars out of a possible 10 stars.","finished_norm":["my","grandmoth","take","me","and","my","sister","out","to","see","thi","movi","when","it","come","out","in","theater","back","in","and","so","we","happili","bui","the","ticket","the","popcorn","and","soda","and","walk","right","in","to","the","theater","and","sit","down","to","watch","the","movi","when","it","be","over","the","audienc","do","not","applaud","strongli","i","rememb","that","i","hear","a","few","peopl","sai","that","thei","do","not","like","it","at","all","i","do","not","like","it","i","think","that","it","be","rather","stupid","and","not","worth","see","eddi","murphi","be","hyster","in","thi","but","apart","from","him","the","whole","movi","be","bad","i","rare","laugh","at","the","part","in","thi","i","conjur","rememb","that","the","other","peopl","in","the","theater","almost","hardli","even","laugh","and","what","i","realli","think","be","bad","be","make","the","anim","talk","becaus","talk","anim","onli","exist","in","cartoon","in","live","action","movi","thei","be","total","a","mutt","i","sai","that","apart","from","eddi","murphi","hyster","twist","he","bring","in","thi","movi","be","not","worth","watch","it","be","rather","stupidbr","br","i","have","see","eddi","murphi","in","sever","of","movi","and","i","think","that","he","be","funni","in","that","i","have","just","sai","that","he","be","the","onli","funni","part","of","thi","movi","i","conjur","have","not","see","eddi","murphi","in","the","realli","great","movi","the","adventur","of","pluto","nash","thi","movi","be","not","a","movi","that","i","would","realli","recommend","that","you","see","becaus","apart","from","eddi","murphi","you","probabl","be","not","go","to","like","thi","especi","becaus","of","a","lot","the","the","talk","anim","in","it","br","br","i","will","give","thi","movi","a","rate","of","star","out","of","a","possibl","star"],"filtered":["grandmoth","take","sister","see","thi","movi","come","theater","back","happili","bui","ticket","popcorn","soda","walk","right","theater","sit","watch","movi","audienc","applaud","strongli","rememb","hear","peopl","sai","thei","like","like","think","rather","stupid","worth","see","eddi","murphi","hyster","thi","apart","whole","movi","bad","rare","laugh","part","thi","conjur","rememb","peopl","theater","almost","hardli","even","laugh","realli","think","bad","make","anim","talk","becaus","talk","anim","onli","exist","cartoon","live","action","movi","thei","total","mutt","sai","apart","eddi","murphi","hyster","twist","bring","thi","movi","worth","watch","rather","stupidbr","br","see","eddi","murphi","sever","movi","think","funni","sai","onli","funni","part","thi","movi","conjur","see","eddi","murphi","realli","great","movi","adventur","pluto","nash","thi","movi","movi","realli","recommend","see","becaus","apart","eddi","murphi","probabl","go","like","thi","especi","becaus","lot","talk","anim","br","br","give","thi","movi","rate","star","possibl","star"],"filtered2":["grandmoth","take","sister","see","come","theater","back","happili","bui","ticket","popcorn","soda","walk","right","theater","sit","watch","audienc","applaud","strongli","rememb","hear","peopl","like","like","think","rather","stupid","worth","see","eddi","murphi","hyster","apart","whole","bad","rare","laugh","part","conjur","rememb","peopl","theater","almost","hardli","even","laugh","realli","think","bad","make","anim","talk","becaus","talk","anim","onli","exist","cartoon","live","action","total","mutt","apart","eddi","murphi","hyster","twist","bring","worth","watch","rather","stupidbr","see","eddi","murphi","sever","think","funni","onli","funni","part","conjur","see","eddi","murphi","realli","great","adventur","pluto","nash","realli","recommend","see","becaus","apart","eddi","murphi","probabl","go","like","especi","becaus","lot","talk","anim","give","rate","star","possibl","star"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,7,9,11,12,13,22,23,30,31,34,39,51,61,62,63,72,100,111,116,121,129,131,133,136,148,160,168,184,186,202,216,219,244,250,267,277,290,294,298,316,347,402,424,435,528,572,585,653,665,1013,1076,1618,2101,2219,2225,2251,2756,2765,2896,3391,3984,7268],"values":[1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,7,9,11,12,13,22,23,30,31,34,39,51,61,62,63,72,100,111,116,121,129,131,133,136,148,160,168,184,186,202,216,219,244,250,267,277,290,294,298,316,347,402,424,435,528,572,585,653,665,1013,1076,1618,2101,2219,2225,2251,2756,2765,2896,3391,3984,7268],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9381148836729736,3.2785010273469735,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,2.1367141713444147,1.982619630677639,3.200185830788664,3.3953824709201923,3.893772050208532,2.729695454751562,1.3364419891718522,1.40706698114

{"value":"At first look of the plot tagline I figured it could have been a decent film. Could I have ever been more wrong? The beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film. For the first 10 minutes you don't notice the cheesy acting, horrible sound and god-awful special effects, but then it gets worse. Just about 20 minutes into it I was asking myself, \"What was the plot again?\" I could only ask that question when I wasn't busted out laughing from the sheer lameness of this film. The main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film, even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in-between. The flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re-live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie. Now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off Morpheus from \"The Matrix,\" although he is doing just a horrible job. The actor's talking about \"Star Wars\" and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable. Now at the end of the movie you don't realize that it's the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing. The \"Morpheus\" character dies, the ONLY good thing about the movie. He utters a couple words and the credits roll. What is this? No plot, bad acting, cheesy everything, it couldn't get any worse.

{"value":"In 1925, childhood friends Marie Dressler (as Maggie Warren) and Polly Moran (as Lizzie Praskins) oversee the wedding of their children, Anita Page (as Helen) and Norman Foster (as John). Before the celebration, Ms. Dressler turns the reigns of her small town bank over to her son, Mr. Foster. Six years later, the Great Depression brings many bank closures, and financial insecurity. Banker Foster is able to survive, due to mother Dressler's wise planning. But, Ms. Moran is worried about her fortune, and loudly demands a complete withdrawal. Other \"Warren Bank\" customers hear Moran's rant, and start questioning their own solvency. Soon, the family is in financial crisis.<br /><br />Dressler's huge critical and financial film hit \"Emma\" had been released early in the year, and MGM had to have wanted to get a new Dressler film out as soon as possible. Dressler's 1931 hits, \"Reducing\" and \"Politics\" were still making a lot of money; and, Dressler had become 1932's US #1 Box Office Star, according to the industry standard list compiled by Quigley Publications. \"Prosperity\" certainly celebrated Dressler's status, but the production appears uncharacteristically sloppy, and rushed. The cast does well, considering. Some more care in direction and editing, and some retakes, would have helped apparently, they needed it in theaters for the holidays.<br /><br />**** Prosperity (11/12/32) Sam Wood ~ Marie Dressler,

{"value":"MINOR SPOILERS!<br /><br />Well i just sat up late and watched this film, mainly because i enjoyed and rated some of Singleton's earlier work like \"Boyz n the hood\". However, i have to say this was a major disappointment and is everything i hate about contrived, clichéd, so-called \"message\" movies. <br /><br />The acting is mainly poor,(pop stars and models do NOT necessarily make good actors...take note), the situations hard to swallow, (rape victim becomes overnight lesbian?...please!), but worst of all it reinforces every screwed up stereotype you can think of. By the second half of the film it has become cartoon like in its characterisation, making you lose any shred of empathy you may have had for its one-dimensional players.<br /><br />Not once is any valid point made about the inherent causes of racism and cultural, sexual and political ignorance. As a result it merely ends up sensationalising the results of these problems. It's message is contradictory, resulting in a sense of confusion and a general lack of plot cohesion. As for the films conclusion i found it predictable, embarrassing, exploitative and mildly offensive. For a film called \"Higher Learning\" i have to say all i learned is to avoid seeing this ever again.<br /><br />If you want a true comment on some of the themes that this film completely fails to elaborate upon then go hire \"American History X\"....unless you were just watching it for Tyra Banks then go hire a life.","finished_norm":["minor","spoilersbr","br","good","i","just","sit","up","late","and","watch","thi","film","mainli","becaus","i","enjoi","and","rate","some","of","singleton","earli","work","like","boyz","n","the","hood","howev","i","have","to","sai","thi","be","a","major","disappoint","and","be","everyth","i","hate","about","contriv","clichéd","socal","messag","movi","br","br","the","act","be","mainli","poorpop","star","and","model","do","not","necessarili","make","good","actorstak","note","the","situat","hard","to","swallow","rape","victim","becom","overnight","lesbianpleas","but","wrong","of","all","it","reinforc","everi","screw","up","stereotyp","you","can","think","of","by","the","half","of","the","film","it","have","becom","cartoon","like","in","it","characteris","make","you","lose","ani","shred","of","empathi","you","mai","have","have","for","it","onedimension","playersbr","br","not","onc","be","ani","valid","point","make","about","the","inher","caus","of","racism","and","cultur","sexual","and","polit","ignor","a","a","result","it","mere","end","up","sensationalis","the","result","of","thi","problem","it","messag","be","contradictori","result","in","a","sens","of","confus","and","a","gener","lack","of","plot","cohes","a","for","the","film","conclus","i","find","it","predict","embarrass","exploit","and","mildli","offens","for","a","film","call","high","learn","i","have","to","sai","all","i","learn","be","to","avoid","see","thi","ever","againbr","br","if","you","want","a","true","comment","on","some","of","the","theme","that","thi","film","complet","fail","to","elabor","upon","then","go","hire","american","histori","xunless","you","be","just","watch","it","for","tyra","bank","then","go","hire","a","life"],"filtered":["minor","spoilersbr","br","good","sit","late","watch","thi","film","mainli","becaus","enjoi","rate","singleton","earli","work","like","boyz","n","hood","howev","sai","thi","major","disappoint","everyth","hate","contriv","clichéd","socal","messag","movi","br","br","act","mainli","poorpop","star","model","necessarili","make","good","actorstak","note","situat","hard","swallow","rape","victim","becom","overnight","lesbianpleas","wrong","reinforc","everi","screw","stereotyp","think","half","film","becom","cartoon","like","characteris","make","lose","ani","shred","empathi","mai","onedimension","playersbr","br","onc","ani","valid","point","make","inher","caus","racism","cultur","sexual","polit","ignor","result","mere","end","sensationalis","result","thi","problem","messag","contradictori","result","sens","confus","gener","lack","plot","cohes","film","conclus","find","predict","embarrass","exploit","mildli","offens","film","call","high","learn","sai","learn","avoid","see","thi","ever","againbr","br","want","true","comment","theme","thi","film","complet","fail","elabor","upon","go","hire","american","histori","xunless","watch","tyra","bank","go","hire","life"],"filtered2":["minor","spoilersbr","good","sit","late","watch","mainli","becaus","enjoi","rate","singleton","earli","work","like","boyz","n","hood","howev","major","disappoint","everyth","hate","contriv","clichéd","socal","messag","act","mainli","poorpop","star","model","necessarili","make","good","actorstak","note","situat","hard","swallow","rape","victim","becom","overnight","lesbianpleas","wrong","reinforc","everi","screw","stereotyp","think","half","becom","cartoon","like","characteris","make","lose","ani","shred","empathi","mai","onedimension","playersbr","onc","ani","valid","point","make","inher","caus","racism","cultur","sexual","polit","ignor","result","mere","end","sensationalis","result","problem","messag","contradictori","result","sens","confus","gener","lack","plot","cohes","conclus","find","predict","embarrass","exploit","mildli","offens","call","high","learn","learn","avoid","see","ever","againbr","want","true","comment","theme","complet","fail","elabor","upon","go","hire","american","histori","xunless","watch","tyra","bank","go","hire","life"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,12,21,22,24,25,27,32,37,38,44,46,48,66,75,85,100,103,113,115,142,150,167,171,173,183,187,193,200,202,206,211,215,221,223,225,236,244,266,280,304,335,337,339,404,427,430,447,453,473,499,519,533,535,557,560,569,575,604,630,653,746,763,836,880,918,957,1014,1097,1102,1145,1181,1211,1265,1534,1560,1703,1785,1803,2109,2267,2415,2533,2688,2738,2741,2927,2979,3348,3728,3772,3846,4368,5103,7513],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,7,12,21,22,24,25,27,32,37,38,44,46,48,66,75,85,100,103,113,115,142,150,167,171,173,1

{"value":"Now, I haven't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so I'm not going to go down that path here.<br /><br />But I have some time ago learnt that Stephen King movies simply -are not- horror films, with perhaps a couple of exceptions. This was not one of them. It started well enough, and for once I'm not going to complain about the acting, although Fred Gwynne was as usual wonderful.. Also I will forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as they were necessary to make the story here move forward...<br /><br />But there was one consistent point that I couldn't help but get annoyed with. And that came pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity. The moments I refer to are thus: There is a tiny zombie running around the house. You suspect it is under the bed. Do you <br /><br />(a) get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up, exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you, or <br /><br />(b) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety, or at least see the mini terror coming at you, giving you a little reaction time.<br /><br />I know, let's go with (a). I feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today. Bleh<br /><br />Fun enough film though...

{"value":"Director Spike Lee is famous for making films pointing out racism. In many of films, such \"Do The Right Thing,\" most of the white people are all brutal racists. In this movie, interracial marriage is the subject, with racism once again being the entire issue.<br /><br />What Lee does, however, is once again demonstrate his bigotry against Christianity. It's amazing the double standards that exist in the film world. If Lee or anyone else ever produced this kind of bias against another group he would be vilified, but Christians? Hey, it's \"open season\" on them.<br /><br />Ossie Davis, a reverend in this film, shoots his son and then puts the smoldering gun down on top of his Bible. They zoom in on that for another closeup just in case you missed it. Hey, folks, here's another Bible reader and look what he''s like! Lee does this sort of thing in just about every movie he makes.<br /><br />He shows the same hatred when dealing with race relations. Who could argue with portraying racism as an evil thing? However, Lee perpetuates it in this film as he has in his other films. His obvious bitterness toward white people doesn't help the situation. It only adds fuel to the fire. <br /><br />Hey, Spike: start \"doing the right thing\" and leave your prejudices in the closet.

{"value":"Any movie with \"National Lampoon\" in the title is absolutely guaranteed to die a death in London,England,Paris,France,Rome,Italy,and anywhere in Germany.It may be an institution in the U.S. but it is practically unknown in Europe to the larger audience.\"National Lampoon's European Vacation\" is unlikely to rectify that situation. The appalling Griswalds are just that - appalling.They are not funny. Clearly Mr Chevy Chase thinks he's funny, after all Miss B.di Angelo laughs a lot at his jokes,but she's getting paid for it and didn't have to fork out £2.50 for the privilege. The section set in England is typical.The same old same old TV performers, Messrs Idle,Smith,Coltrane,Miss M.Lippman trot out the same old same old tired clichés,Mr Chase gets lost in the hotel corridor....yawn,yawn,yawn.. Bucking - ham Palace,Big Ben......I feel cheated that we never saw bobbies on bicycles two-by-two.........rosie red cheeks on the little chil - dren,need I go on? The English are buffoons,the French vicious - tongued Yank-haters.The Germans pompous and puffed up,(don't mention the war,Clark),and the Italians lecherous bottom-pinchers.Have I forgotten anything?

{"value":"The soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb. The soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy. One by one, the blood is drained from those involved in the dig.<br /><br />To be as brief as possible, Pharaoh's Curse is quite the lackluster affair. While the movie does present a few good, original ideas (blood sucking mummy's, soul transference, interesting make-up effects, the arm ripping scene, etc.) and a few atmospheric moments, the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding. To make matters even worse, the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding. I usually go for these slow moving mummy movies, but Pharaoh's Curse tests even my patients. The cast helps very little. With only one exception (Ziva Rodann is the lone bright spot  wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character), the cast is as dull as the screenplay. Finally, I don't know whose idea it was to put the mummy-looking servant in what appears to be pajamas, but it's a laughable, ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience.<br /><br />Despite my mostly negative comments on the Pharaoh's Curse, I'm going to rate it a 4/10. Not a good rating to be sure, but generous given all the problems I have with the movie.","finished_norm":["the","soul","of","a","ancient","mummi","be","transfer","to","on","of","hi","follow","so","that","he","mai","punish","everyon","involv","in","the","desecr","of","hi","tomb","the","soul","transfer","make","the","young","man","ag","at","a","tremend","pace","until","he","himself","resembl","a","mummi","on","by","on","the","blood","be","drain","from","that","involv","in","the","digbr","br","to","be","a","brief","a","possibl","pharaoh","curs","be","quit","the","lacklust","affair","while","the","movi","doe","present","a","few","good","origin","idea","blood","suck","mummi","soul","transfer","interest","makeup","effect","the","arm","rip","scene","etc","and","a","few","atmospher","moment","the","direct","and","pace","be","the","veri","definit","of","plod","to","make","matter","even","wrong","the","of","the","film","rel","short","minut","runtim","consist","of","noth","much","much","than","pad","i","usual","go","for","thi","slow","move","mummi","movi","but","pharaoh","curs","test","even","my","patient","the","cast","help","veri","littl","with","onli","on","except","ziva","rodann","be","the","lone","bright","spot","wish","the","movi","can","have","focu","much","on","her","mysteri","charact","the","cast","be","a","dull","a","the","screenplai","final","i","do","not","know","whose","idea","it","be","to","put","the","mummylook","servant","in","what","appear","to","be","pajama","but","it","a","laughabl","ridicul","look","for","a","creatur","that","suppos","to","instil","fear","in","the","audiencebr","br","despit","my","mostli","neg","comment","on","the","pharaoh","curs","i","be","go","to","rate","it","a","not","a","good","rate","to","be","sure","but","gener","give","all","the","problem","i","have","with","the","movi"],"filtered":["soul","ancient","mummi","transfer","hi","follow","mai","punish","everyon","involv","desecr","hi","tomb","soul","transfer","make","young","man","ag","tremend","pace","resembl","mummi","blood","drain","involv","digbr","br","brief","possibl","pharaoh","curs","quit","lacklust","affair","movi","doe","present","good","origin","idea","blood","suck","mummi","soul","transfer","interest","makeup","effect","arm","rip","scene","etc","atmospher","moment","direct","pace","veri","definit","plod","make","matter","even","wrong","film","rel","short","minut","runtim","consist","noth","much","much","pad","usual","go","thi","slow","move","mummi","movi","pharaoh","curs","test","even","patient","cast","help","veri","littl","onli","except","ziva","rodann","lone","bright","spot","wish","movi","focu","much","mysteri","charact","cast","dull","screenplai","final","know","whose","idea","put","mummylook","servant","appear","pajama","laughabl","ridicul","look","creatur","suppos","instil","fear","audiencebr","br","despit","mostli","neg","comment","pharaoh","curs","go","rate","good","rate","sure","gener","give","problem","movi"],"filtered2":["soul","ancient","mummi","transfer","follow","mai","punish","everyon","involv","desecr","tomb","soul","transfer","make","young","man","ag","tremend","pace","resembl","mummi","blood","drain","involv","digbr","brief","possibl","pharaoh","curs","quit","lacklust","affair","doe","present","good","origin","idea","blood","suck","mummi","soul","transfer","interest","makeup","effect","arm","rip","scene","etc","atmospher","moment","direct","pace","veri","definit","plod","make","matter","even","wrong","rel","short","minut","runtim","consist","noth","pad","usual","go","slow","move","mummi","pharaoh","curs","test","even","patient","cast","help","veri","littl","onli","except","ziva","rodann","lone","bright","spot","wish","focu","mysteri","charact","cast","dull","screenplai","final","know","whose","idea","put","mummylook","servant","appear","pajama","laughabl","ridicul","look","creatur","suppos","instil","fear","audiencebr","despit","mostli","neg","comment","pharaoh","curs","go","rate","good","rate","sure","gener","give","problem"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,6,10,11,14,15,16,18,19,25,26,30,45,46,49,59,60,69,92,102,106,119,120,123,135,149,156,159,167,169,185,188,202,225,233,241,246,260,265,272,274,275,280,355,367,390,391,392,399,402,403,411,421,429,442,510,546,552,598,619,703,761,812,824,828,835,960,991,1006,1007,1053,1147,1165,1186,1201,1306,1329,1566,1687,1691,1722,1915,1975,2190,2207,2427,2440,2742,2875,3295,3504,3561,3660,7418],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,6,10,11,14,15,16,18,19,25,26,30,45,46,49,59,60,69,92,102,106,119,120,123,135,149,156,159,167,169,185,188,202,225,233,241,246,260,265,272,274,275,280,355,367,390,391,392,399,402,403,411,421,429

{"value":"Ok, I've seen plenty of movies dealing with witches and the occult but this one was just plain weird. This movie starts out as this cult of witches led by a really bad Orson Wells playing the staring role (couldn't they have gotten somebody that looked and acted more like a Satanist) he just did not belong in this movie at all. But anyhow, the coven takes a new member and stabs a doll that resembles somebody and makes her have a miscarrage. The lady that had the miscarrage and her husband go off to a place called Lillith on busness and the lady meanwhile is seeing an image of her sister or whoever it is calling to her and warning her to stay away from there and to never use her powers there or she will die. The couple after they get settled down in the strange town discover that all the inhabitants are all witches and she becomes nosey and afraid of all of her neighbors and friends. Then strange things start to happen as the lady discovers a funeral taking place on a hill that suddenly disapears (that was creepy) as well as seeing the little boy belonging to Orson Wells at the playgroud that he later asks the lady to help him bring back to life. The lady soon tries to escape the town but only to find herself traped by it's inhabitants and powers and finds herself ignoring all of what the spirit tries to warn her about. This movie is ok, it's has it's moments of suspense but it really could have done much better than to have Orson in there.","finished_norm":["okai","i","have","see","plenti","of","movi","deal","with","witch","and","the","occult","but","thi","on","be","just","plain","weird","thi","movi","start","out","a","thi","cult","of","witch","lead","by","a","realli","bad","orson","well","plai","the","stare","role","can","not","thei","have","get","somebodi","that","look","and","act","much","like","a","satanist","he","just","do","not","belong","in","thi","movi","at","all","but","anyhow","the","coven","take","a","new","member","and","stab","a","doll","that","resembl","somebodi","and","make","her","have","a","miscarrag","the","ladi","that","have","the","miscarrag","and","her","husband","go","off","to","a","place","call","lillith","on","bus","and","the","ladi","meanwhil","be","see","a","imag","of","her","sister","or","whoever","it","be","call","to","her","and","warn","her","to","stai","awai","from","there","and","to","never","us","her","power","there","or","she","will","die","the","coupl","after","thei","get","settl","down","in","the","strang","town","discov","that","all","the","inhabit","be","all","witch","and","she","becom","nosei","and","afraid","of","all","of","her","neighbor","and","friend","then","strang","thing","start","to","happen","a","the","ladi","discov","a","funer","take","place","on","a","hill","that","suddenli","disapear","that","be","creepi","a","good","a","see","the","littl","boi","belong","to","orson","well","at","the","playgroud","that","he","late","ask","the","ladi","to","help","him","bring","back","to","life","the","ladi","soon","try","to","escap","the","town","but","onli","to","find","herself","trape","by","it","inhabit","and","power","and","find","herself","ignor","all","of","what","the","spirit","try","to","warn","her","about","thi","movi","be","okai","it","have","it","moment","of","suspens","but","it","realli","can","have","do","much","well","than","to","have","orson","in","there"],"filtered":["okai","see","plenti","movi","deal","witch","occult","thi","plain","weird","thi","movi","start","thi","cult","witch","lead","realli","bad","orson","well","plai","stare","role","thei","get","somebodi","look","act","much","like","satanist","belong","thi","movi","anyhow","coven","take","new","member","stab","doll","resembl","somebodi","make","miscarrag","ladi","miscarrag","husband","go","place","call","lillith","bus","ladi","meanwhil","see","imag","sister","whoever","call","warn","stai","awai","never","us","power","die","coupl","thei","get","settl","strang","town","discov","inhabit","witch","becom","nosei","afraid","neighbor","friend","strang","thing","start","happen","ladi","discov","funer","take","place","hill","suddenli","disapear","creepi","good","see","littl","boi","belong","orson","well","playgroud","late","ask","ladi","help","bring","back","life","ladi","soon","try","escap","town","onli","find","trape","inhabit","power","find","ignor","spirit","try","warn","thi","movi","okai","moment","suspens","realli","much","well","orson"],"filtered2":["okai","see","plenti","deal","witch","occult","plain","weird","start","cult","witch","lead","realli","bad","orson","well","plai","stare","role","get","somebodi","look","act","like","satanist","belong","anyhow","coven","take","new","member","stab","doll","resembl","somebodi","make","miscarrag","ladi","miscarrag","husband","go","place","call","lillith","bus","ladi","meanwhil","see","imag","sister","whoever","call","warn","stai","awai","never","us","power","die","coupl","get","settl","strang","town","discov","inhabit","witch","becom","nosei","afraid","neighbor","friend","strang","thing","start","happen","ladi","discov","funer","take","place","hill","suddenli","disapear","creepi","good","see","littl","boi","belong","orson","well","playgroud","late","ask","ladi","help","bring","back","life","ladi","soon","try","escap","town","onli","find","trape","inhabit","power","find","ignor","spirit","try","warn","okai","moment","suspens","realli","well","orson"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,9,11,13,14,16,20,21,29,31,36,38,40,42,56,63,71,75,87,94,115,128,142,150,155,157,161,164,185,188,191,250,253,282,293,306,365,366,417,449,450,468,472,527,529,536,585,586,618,625,638,740,755,763,782,785,887,894,933,1018,1053,1082,1135,1244,1540,1557,1584,1609,1727,1757,2112,2179,2378,3150,4755,5408,6130],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,6,9,11,13,14,16,20,21,29,31,36,38,40,42,56,63,71,75,87,94,115,128,142,150,155,157,161,164,185,188,191,250,253,282,293,306,365,366,417,449,450,468,472,527,529,536,585,586,618,625,638,740,755,763,782,785,887,894,933,1018,1053,1082,1135,1244,1540,1557,1584,1609,1727,1757,2112,2179,2378,3150,4755,5408,6130],

{"value":"Vincente Minelli movies are usually worth your time; Meet Me in St Louis, The Bad and the Beautiful. I awaited this movie with great interest. But what a disappointment. <br /><br />Some Came Running is scene after scene of go-nowhere fatalism. Sinatra is a sad sack, returned from the war to find disappointing family relationships, a disappointing floozy hanging on him, living in disappointing digs as a gal persuades him to finish his disappointing writing project. The movie has a big dramatic finish in which a disappointing villain catches up with Sinatra and MacClane and something disappointing happens. The sequence is intended to be tension-filled but Minelli is no Hitchcock; he gets so distracted by pretty colors, he doesn't notice the scene is a wheezing cliché and the characters are so thinly-drawn and poorly developed we don't particularly care that they get shot. (especially MacClane) But that's the only real cinematography in the project. Otherwise we look at constipated characters standing around bars & living rooms getting on each others nerves for two hours. Hell IS other people, apparently.<br /><br />There is nothing going on in this movie. The dilemma of soldiers returning to displacement and indifference after WW2 is handled more deftly in 'The Best Years of Our Lives.' And either of two Inge products, 'Splendor in the Grass' and 'Picnic' covers the desperation of being trapped in a dead-end town, with much more

{"value":"When I'd seen the name of this movie, I'd always thought it was a musical. Like \"The Harvey Girls.\" It's not. It's a pudding that overcooked, hit the kitchen ceiling, and was pried off and cobbled together. No music and not a period piece but thoroughly improbable.<br /><br />It starts with patriarch James Woods telling the eldest of his three daughters, a small child who grows to be Barbara Stanwyck, that she must maintain the family name and home.<br /><br />We thus think it is going to be a historical intergenerational tale. And it is, for a brief time. Then it turns into the story of cold-hearted Stanwyck's fight against lawyer George Brent. Why is she so dead set against him? Well, why else? As we learn in a strange flashback sequence narrated by Stanwyck, she had once thought she could inherit some money (for her sisters as well as herself, of course) by marrying. She hit on someone she took to be a country bumpkin, who was in fact budding lawyer Brent.<br /><br />Lest anyone think the child they had, a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot, is -- well, you know ... They had a hasty marriage and during the very short time they were together, he was conceived.<br /><br />One of her sisters is in love with a painter named Gig Young, who is played by Gig Young.

{"value":"We all know a movie never does complete justice to the book, but this is exceptional. Important characters were cut out, Blanca and Alba were essentially mushed into the same character, most of the subplots and major elements of the main plot were eliminated. Clara's clairvoyance was extremely downplayed, making her seem like a much more shallow character than the one I got to know in the book. In the book we learn more about her powers and the important effects she had on so many people, which in turn was a key element in the life of the family. In the movie she was no more than some special lady. The relationship between Esteban and Pedro Tercero (Tercero-third-, by the way, is the son and thus comes after Segundo-second-) and its connections to that between Esteban and his grandson from Pancha García (not son, who he also did recognize) is chopped in half and its importance downplayed.<br /><br />One of the most fundamental things about the book that the film is all but stripped of: this is called \"The House of the Spirits.\" Where is the house? The story of 3-4 generations of a family is supposed to revolve around the \"big house on the corner,\" a line stated so many times in the novel. The house in fundamental to the story, but the movie unjustly relegates it to a mere backdrop.<br /><br />If I hadn't read the book before, I would have never guessed that such a sappy, shallow movie

{"value":"I see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story, and I thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. The fact that they basically came up with excuses -- rewrites, budget constraints, production formats etc -- simply underlines how bad this movie is. And my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn't make the cut.<br /><br />It's watchable, but barely so. There are plot holes in every corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. The modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. Would ya wrassle us up some Hamburger Helper Sally, between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers? Apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to MREs. Once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone.<br /><br />The rationale for the encounter with the fearsome Rook is that it can't be killed single handedly. Yet only one scene ago, the hero making that case abandoned King to do exactly that. Huh? Vivian Woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie.

{"value":"I am not a big fan of horror films, and have only seen a handful of them (and none of the \"Halloween\"s or \"Friday the Thirteenth\"s) - but I can appreciate a frightening horror film not because of gore. And I'm pretty sure this isn't scary.<br /><br /> What's so spooky about a little plastic skull that pops up everywhere? In all of its appearances there are faraway establishing shots, so there's no real surprise in any of this film. (Not that a skull in of itself is that scary anyway, but . . .)<br /><br /> The plot concerns Claus Von Bulow's third cousin (John Hudson), who marries a Donna-reed look-a-like (Peggey Webber, giving one of the worst performances ever) who begins seeing skulls and hearing the mysterious screams of a group of peacocks on her husband's mansion. Did I mention that her husband lost her first wife in a mysterious drowning incident? OOOOH!!!! Wonder who did it!!!!<br /><br /> This is the same old plot about a rich boy trying to kill and/or drive their wife insane. If you want to see a well-done version of this stuff, try \"Reversal of Fortune\".

{"value":"This is Peter Falk's film. Period.<br /><br />I was 10 years old when this film came out; I was already a film maven at the time. Of course neither my parents nor I saw this film when it came out, but I was in love with the typeface of its ads & the aura that this was An Important Film. Okay, 34 years later I've finally seen the film--having never seen any Cassavetes-directed film previously. He's a hack, overall. Zero sense of timing, editing. Gena's performance reminds me too much of Dustin Hoffman's stint in \"Rain Man\": technically on par but entirely one-note. As Tom Cruise stole \"Rain Man,\" Falk takes the cake for this film.<br /><br />I was annoyed with Gena's performance, really throughout--it seemed better suited for \"Awakenings\" (blecch!). It's not all her fault: she's a basket case from first scene to last. We never find out why?? But Falk's character seems real & is performed WONDERFULLY by Falk as a seriously flawed man.<br /><br />Shave off at least an hour (an editor needed!), and this would have been an arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple, Cro-Magnon, man coming to grips with a wife who doesn't work & yet cannot deal with her three kids & her husband's long hours of work.<br /><br

{"value":"The British claymation series putting \"witty\" conversations taped from \"average\" people in the mouths of \"cute\" fanciful creatures at least had the advantage for non-British viewers of seeming droll and the kind of rarefied cultured humor you couldn't get on U.S. television. Someone made the mistake of PUTTING it on U.S. television.<br /><br />Sort of like the sadly miscast American version of the sublime Brit-com COUPLING which died in a month on NBC when the same basic scripts didn't \"translate\" from British English to American English, what seemed droll and cultured (and just a BIT dull) in England, comes across in CREATURE COMFORTS, the American Version, as simply boredom with puppets. There's no through plot-line, no characters and after one and a half episodes watched (of the three ultimately aired), no reason to suffer through more.<br /><br />The only positive thing to be said about the new summer series and the mercifully brief run it had is that the claymation is at least professionally done and coming as a set-up for the single worst show on the CBS schedule, The New Adventures of Old Christine (or \"how to be a HORRIBLE mother - or person - in one interminable, unfunny lesson\"), kids who wanted to stay up past their bedtime happily ran to bed rather than sit through this show, and the adults could wait to tune in until 9pm when \"Two and A Half Men\" (guilty pleasure) and \"How I Met Your Mother\" (actual quality writing) come
