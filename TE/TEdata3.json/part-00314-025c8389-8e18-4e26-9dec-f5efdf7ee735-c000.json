{"value":"I was looking on Imdbs bottom 100 because i thought id never seen anything as bad as plan 9 from outerspace or Roller Ball remake, I was wrong. Ben and Arthur has beaten both.<br /><br />This out of the many countless amount of movies I've seen is the number one worst film on the i ever saw. Bad Directing ,Bad Characters ,Horrible Acting ,Horrible story There's a reason nobody but Sam ever says anything positive about this film. Sam was a horrible annoying actor but his directing was so bad he may just overthrow Ed Wood.<br /><br />The Director should be ashamed of his work unfortunately i have to give it at least 1 star but it deserves - to be continued

{"value":"Just saw this movie, and what a waste of time. The movie was predictable and slow. It's basically the Mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball. Rather than watching this movie, I should have had a root canal. The cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship / funding. This movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by Mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball, however because it's rated PG, the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film. The acting is horrible with the exception of Clint Howard and Fred Willard. Thurl Bailey's appearance in the film was completely unnecessary.","finished_norm":["just","see","thi","movi","and","what","a","wast","of","time","the","movi","be","predict","and","slow","it","basic","the","mormon","bad","new","bear","that","plai","church","sanction","basketbal","rather","than","watch","thi","movi","i","should","have","have","a","root","canal","the","cameo","perform","be","obvious","drive","by","sponsorship","fund","thi","movi","have","potenti","due","to","the","outrag","behavior","that","be","exhibit","by","mormon","when","thei","plai","church","sanction","basketbal","howev","becaus","it","rate","pg","the","true","natur","of","the","spectacl","can","not","be","transfer","to","film","the","act","be","horribl","with","the","except","of","clint","howard","and","fred","willard","thurl","bailei","appear","in","the","film","be","complet","unnecessari"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","wast","time","movi","predict","slow","basic","mormon","bad","new","bear","plai","church","sanction","basketbal","rather","watch","thi","movi","root","canal","cameo","perform","obvious","drive","sponsorship","fund","thi","movi","potenti","due","outrag","behavior","exhibit","mormon","thei","plai","church","sanction","basketbal","howev","becaus","rate","pg","true","natur","spectacl","transfer","film","act","horribl","except","clint","howard","fred","willard","thurl","bailei","appear","film","complet","unnecessari"],"filtered2":["see","wast","time","predict","slow","basic","mormon","bad","new","bear","plai","church","sanction","basketbal","rather","watch","root","canal","cameo","perform","obvious","drive","sponsorship","fund","potenti","due","outrag","behavior","exhibit","mormon","plai","church","sanction","basketbal","howev","becaus","rate","pg","true","natur","spectacl","transfer","act","horribl","except","clint","howard","fred","willard","thurl","bailei","appear","complet","unnecessari"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,8,9,21,22,40,87,89,103,105,113,160,170,202,230,232,286,304,337,341,390,456,461,525,547,568,1081,1130,1199,1363,1494,1496,1739,2019,2052,2091,2187,3003,3218,3622,3899,5310,6354,6792,7585],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,8,9,21,22,40,87,89,103,105,113,160,170,202,230,232,286,304,337,341,390,456,461,525,547,568,1081,1130,1199,1363,1494,1496,1739,2019,2052,2091,2187,3003,3218,3622,3899,5310,6354,6792,7585],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,3.2569937516641474,2.115024371522662,1.9940046109572438,2.098582041218749,2.1765612129984904,2.1521782565202803,2.3722295531801256,2.4214486257841834,2.597304642813496,2.7121382192999195,2.6102777977348763,2.780700890737216,2.871119826396843,2.973659465713028,2.933776879434709,3.132778125427319,3.3001658770939146,3.358217889001879,3.4149707055943286,3.432149042129413,3.4471119148061256,4.1302590120314875,8.832568166551278,4.291900363587903,4.396611317676934,4.558366596889411,4.9676558014359795,4.751432692966343,5.0768550934009715,5.102830579804232,5.02684467282631,5.064116067623542,12.350934764138163,11.39178860361439,5.719991853386255,5.850044981634453,6.255510089742618,6.660975197850782,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006066E-4,2.4075667160687803E-4,2.4081611628889928E-4,2.407677045465099E-4,2.4079049035382463E-4,2.407553441472228E-4,2.408302224017342E-4,2.4071952367870044E-4,2.4075672248833935E-4,2.4100551847254184E-4,2.4291782711448486E-4,2.4075712015618692E-4,2.409851323632679E-4,2.4101023885640487E-4,2.409007541978265E-4,2.407686528956506E-4,2.4085148662392325E-4,2.409648321523582E-4,2.407810827430797E-4,2.407802024235517E-4,2.4099682081796445E-4,2.408043261416531E-4,2.4080469057813193E-4,2.4095895264117164E-4,2.4078116959887915E-4,2.4101311952363027E-4,2.4084142415433326E-4,2.4075613202122098E-4,2.4086528056278372E-4,2.409387961184069E-4,2.4080550732584615E-4,2.409344775116553E-4,2.4105277032522763E-4,2.4127650467341201E-4,2.4084100797358134E-4,2.4076850686564587E-4,2.4085531750952708E-4,2.407929591559195E-4,2.407197806021706E-4,2.4078100817709667E-4,2.410223128455228E-4,2.4089009598459934E-4,2.4093502655981748E-4,2.4073176119878166E-4,2.407810694016074E-4,2.4076841632749452E-4,2.4084991425345282E-4,2.408916779296218E-4,2.40842693968142E-4,2.4080451997563935E-4,2.4076901172928727E-4,2.4126230833403908E-4,2.4082959614816143E-4,2.4078101421489198E-4,2.4082830641647583E-4,2.4075637834747286E-4,0.9809713522415775,2.4079394036305142E-4,2.4076934973816337E-4,2.4075624091759236E-4,2.4094885168561962E-4,2.408521287765036E-4,2.4075614027516213E-4,2.4073166311921858E-4,2.4070745489132732E-4,2.4092509253415917E-4,2.4076793474448382E-4,2.4087737889248641E-4,2.4094807029668796E-4,2.4083875684592336E-4,2.4078133312136903E-4,2.4073197870238739E-4,2.40793562390

{"value":"How can a movie with Amy, Posey and Raechel have NOTHING funny in it? Believe it or not 'House Bunny' did this better and funnier. Hopefully the principals had a good holiday and got some money - this movie is an embarrassment to all of them. It is a cliché from beginning to end. Clichés can work well with a script, or at least an idea. This movie does nothing but use cliché after cliché rather than ideas or script. It uses the preexisting persona's of the actresses rather than develop characters. Bad, sad, and rubbish. Now I apparently have to have ten lines of text for a comment. Really? Why? As an IT ops manager this is another example of sloppy coding.","finished_norm":["how","can","a","movi","with","ami","posei","and","raechel","have","noth","funni","in","it","believ","it","or","not","hous","bunni","do","thi","well","and","funni","hopefulli","the","princip","have","a","good","holidai","and","get","some","monei","thi","movi","be","a","embarrass","to","all","of","them","it","be","a","cliché","from","begin","to","end","cliché","can","work","good","with","a","script","or","at","littl","a","idea","thi","movi","doe","noth","but","us","cliché","after","cliché","rather","than","idea","or","script","it","us","the","preexist","persona","of","the","actress","rather","than","develop","charact","bad","sad","and","rubbish","now","i","appar","have","to","have","ten","line","of","text","for","a","comment","realli","why","a","a","it","op","manag","thi","be","anoth","exampl","of","sloppi","code"],"filtered":["movi","ami","posei","raechel","noth","funni","believ","hous","bunni","thi","well","funni","hopefulli","princip","good","holidai","get","monei","thi","movi","embarrass","cliché","begin","end","cliché","work","good","script","littl","idea","thi","movi","doe","noth","us","cliché","cliché","rather","idea","script","us","preexist","persona","actress","rather","develop","charact","bad","sad","rubbish","appar","ten","line","text","comment","realli","op","manag","thi","anoth","exampl","sloppi","code"],"filtered2":["ami","posei","raechel","noth","funni","believ","hous","bunni","well","funni","hopefulli","princip","good","holidai","get","monei","embarrass","cliché","begin","end","cliché","work","good","script","littl","idea","doe","noth","us","cliché","cliché","rather","idea","script","us","preexist","persona","actress","rather","develop","charact","bad","sad","rubbish","appar","ten","line","text","comment","realli","op","manag","anoth","exampl","sloppi","code"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,9,10,13,14,18,20,24,48,49,56,62,73,77,91,107,123,126,147,160,213,280,307,308,320,345,355,455,523,545,556,1098,1824,1839,2006,2031,2161,2450,2555,2945,3620,6668],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,9,10,13,14,18,20,24,48,49,56,62,73,77,91,107,123,126,147,160,213,280,307,308,320,345,355,455,523,545,556,1098,1824,1839,2006,2031,2161,2450,2555,2945,3620,6668],"values":[1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,1.6955116224012472,3.3840606616174704,3.7221218701403576,4.045224089013853,1.8950689206770979,3.8927804517536475,2.0105926690411424,2.1439533986393955,4.523814194644097,2.2391270689902285,2.2844323215331563,4.744459106360251,2.8432628718938773,2.8028805344481915,2.8767855639325206,2.8753661172782943,2.938298364153555,3.0022328381570844,3.0316467233633775,3.2787058260741455,13.994678897883901,3.442099372982581,3.43462735814388,4.186539847930077,4.979216623837056,4.760735085628657,4.956227105612356,5.156897801074508,5.143104478942172,5.426230734858092,5.243909178064138,5.426230734858092,5.850044981634453,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255705E-4,2.2737792632708265E-4,2.2743406769354596E-4,2.2738834617097752E-4,2.2740986578072427E-4,2.2737667263379277E-4,2.2744738993572323E-4,2.2734284269338733E-4,2.2737797438108294E-4,2.2761294487884276E-4,2.2941898734736617E-4,2.2737834995069828E-4,2.2759369161694292E-4,2.276174029529932E-4,2.275140023100701E-4,2.2738924182076205E-4,2.27467472514179E-4,2.2757451948007191E-4,2.2740098094688521E-4,2.274001495463369E-4,2.2760473054921063E-4,2.2742293271974009E-4,2.2742327690463966E-4,2.2756896669080758E-4,2.2740106297614504E-4,2.2762012354277285E-4,2.2745796921172086E-4,2.2737741672596983E-4,2.274804999297561E-4,2.2754993025739278E-4,2.274240482660327E-4,2.2754585163377146E-4,2.276575709662824E-4,2.2786887249241986E-4,2.2745757615795533E-4,2.273891039055822E-4,2.2747109051910816E-4,2.2741219739254252E-4,2.273430853397301E-4,2.2740091052450196E-4,2.2762880509736257E-4,2.2750393636919395E-4,2.275463701715621E-4,2.2735440017971107E-4,2.2740096834679283E-4,2.273890183985972E-4,2.274659875196632E-4,2.27505430406208E-4,2.2745916846251928E-4,2.2742311578245462E-4,2.2738958071416695E-4,2.2785546503755472E-4,2.2744679848279366E-4,2.2740091622677958E-4,2.2744558042094628E-4,2.273776493639772E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441373E-4,2.2738989994003437E-4,2.273775195710164E-4,2.2755942704103584E-4,2.274680789826151E-4,2.27377424521243E-4,2.2735430755038737E-4,2.273314445633672E-4,2.2753698817546124E-4,2.2738856357694845E-4,2.2749192596045116E-4,2.2755868907355293E-4,2.274554501244986E-4,2.2740121741176008E-4,2.2735460559673444E-4,2.2741276710551355E-4,2.2735448314072803E-4,2.2736641433631518E-4,2.2735461203143644E-4,2.2750219694523874E-4,2.2743448501087024E-4,2.2737772801157842E-4,2

{"value":"I saw this film last night (about 102 minutes) and don't know what kept me in my seat. I guess I just expected a film with Gere would have some value in it eventually but nothing of value ever came on the screen. The story is a silly excuse to pile on shot after shot of bondage and torture. There is not a character in the film that does anything like real life. The cutting \"style\" relies on jump cuts, mini flashbacks and overprinting to give weight to this vapid setup of a gang of sadists apparently running free for years and SURPRISE the leader is the \"victim\" of an executed killer. I don't see how Gere, a Buddhist, got involved in this violent, sexist trash.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","film","last","night","about","minut","and","do","not","know","what","keep","me","in","my","seat","i","guess","i","just","expect","a","film","with","gere","would","have","some","valu","in","it","eventu","but","noth","of","valu","ever","come","on","the","screen","the","stori","be","a","silli","excus","to","pile","on","shoot","after","shoot","of","bondag","and","tortur","there","be","not","a","charact","in","the","film","that","doe","anyth","like","real","life","the","cut","styl","reli","on","jump","cut","mini","flashback","and","overprint","to","give","weight","to","thi","vapid","setup","of","a","gang","of","sadist","appar","run","free","for","year","and","surpris","the","leader","be","the","victim","of","a","execut","killer","i","do","not","see","how","gere","a","buddhist","get","involv","in","thi","violent","sexist","trash"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","last","night","minut","know","keep","seat","guess","expect","film","gere","valu","eventu","noth","valu","ever","come","screen","stori","silli","excus","pile","shoot","shoot","bondag","tortur","charact","film","doe","anyth","like","real","life","cut","styl","reli","jump","cut","mini","flashback","overprint","give","weight","thi","vapid","setup","gang","sadist","appar","run","free","year","surpris","leader","victim","execut","killer","see","gere","buddhist","get","involv","thi","violent","sexist","trash"],"filtered2":["see","last","night","minut","know","keep","seat","guess","expect","gere","valu","eventu","noth","valu","ever","come","screen","stori","silli","excus","pile","shoot","shoot","bondag","tortur","charact","doe","anyth","like","real","life","cut","styl","reli","jump","cut","mini","flashback","overprint","give","weight","vapid","setup","gang","sadist","appar","run","free","year","surpris","leader","victim","execut","killer","see","gere","buddhist","get","involv","violent","sexist","trash"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,10,17,18,26,30,34,44,49,57,59,75,80,104,117,130,134,137,144,192,210,241,243,252,303,308,326,380,385,451,535,617,662,671,674,686,716,802,966,997,1051,1133,1426,1628,1750,1985,2213,2600,3106,3943,4821,5077,5788],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,10,17,18,26,30,34,44,49,57,59,75,80,104,117,130,134,137,144,192,210,241,243,252,303,308,326,380,385,451,535,617,662,671,674,686,716,802,966,997,1051,1133,1426,1628,1750,1985,2213,2600,3106,3943,4821,5077,5788],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.604729392502474,1.6920303308087352,1.834162586674748,1.8693254449200722,1.9742250248702675,1.9951803900462557,2.0728240170322856,4.5594602370234405,2.2642139034199635,2.2443961816702407,2.2939035841256437,2.2931108769894046,2.5318267134339894,2.687151791517189,2.6627744961815836,2.627841366673578,3.0433232530252132,5.736597900110404,2.8753661172782943,2.942840385588056,3.102062070196872,3.09496984188738,6.433915638011396,3.4986697244709752,3.5119855004467477,3.616452760127359,3.6466665387238555,3.6405503117064195,3.6016814428070463,3.6746621462132825,3.8883864756110005,4.026392148630444,4.263079925052412,4.191816905030921,4.197121957260614,4.449957298382227,4.706176101378222,4.751432692966343,4.869215728622727,5.102830579804232,5.214056214914456,5.907203395474402,5.7959777603641776,6.137727054086234,13.451027437976705,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875904E-4,2.0127954981638384E-4,2.0132924729208146E-4,2.0128877367343187E-4,2.0130782326822772E-4,2.0127844002166864E-4,2.013410404109268E-4,2.0124849307261725E-4,2.0127959235475906E-4,2.014875930027252E-4,2.0308633840816415E-4,2.0127992481659614E-4,2.014705496249871E-4,2.0149153938033777E-4,2.0140000703507244E-4,2.0128956652077786E-4,2.0135881791649222E-4,2.014535780607691E-4,2.01299958233199E-4,2.0129922226057938E-4,2.01480321511613E-4,2.0131939038753902E-4,2.0131969506698947E-4,2.0144866261914552E-4,2.013000308471627E-4,2.014939477015628E-4,2.0135040540050422E-4,2.0127909870714807E-4,2.0137035004885433E-4,2.0143181118237796E-4,2.0132037789173172E-4,2.0142820070206605E-4,2.0152709691999198E-4,2.0171414531445787E-4,2.0135005746134294E-4,2.012894444354648E-4,2.013620206478001E-4,2.0130988725827593E-4,2.0124870786807883E-4,2.0129989589387772E-4,2.0150163278967912E-4,2.0139109646015094E-4,2.0142865972223016E-4,2.0125872399380575E-4,2.012999470793418E-4,2.012893687429483E-4,2.0135750336924284E-4,2.0139241901200307E-4,2.0135146700162233E-4,2.01319552438365E-4,2.0128986651608998E-4,2.0170227676361376E-4,2.0134051684480355E-4,2.012999009416495E-4,2.0133943859176355E-4,2.012793046430283E-4,0.9840914994019674,2.01310707575854

{"value":"Gee, what a crappy movie this was! I cannot understand what people find so scary about \"The Grudge\". The director plays one trick (I'd have to admit a very good one, that is brought to life very stylized) and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again. As a consequence I startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie, but once I knew the drill I practically fell asleep as The Grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute. To conclude, I can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with, that the so-called predecessor \"The Ring\" was way scarier and that buying a ticket for \"The Grudge\" is a waste of money.","finished_norm":["gee","what","a","crappi","movi","thi","be","i","cannot","understand","what","peopl","find","so","scari","about","the","grudg","the","director","plai","on","trick","i","have","have","to","admit","a","veri","good","on","that","be","bring","to","life","veri","styliz","and","then","he","repeat","it","for","the","rest","of","the","movi","over","and","over","again","a","a","consequ","i","startl","a","few","time","in","the","quarter","of","the","movi","but","onc","i","know","the","drill","i","practic","fall","asleep","a","the","grudg","grow","much","and","much","predict","by","the","minut","to","conclud","i","can","sai","that","there","be","a","lot","well","movi","in","the","genr","to","begin","with","that","the","socal","predecessor","the","ring","be","wai","scari","and","that","bui","a","ticket","for","the","grudg","be","a","wast","of","monei"],"filtered":["gee","crappi","movi","thi","understand","peopl","find","scari","grudg","director","plai","trick","admit","veri","good","bring","life","veri","styliz","repeat","rest","movi","consequ","startl","time","quarter","movi","onc","know","drill","practic","fall","asleep","grudg","grow","much","much","predict","minut","conclud","sai","lot","well","movi","genr","begin","socal","predecessor","ring","wai","scari","bui","ticket","grudg","wast","monei"],"filtered2":["gee","crappi","understand","peopl","find","scari","grudg","director","plai","trick","admit","veri","good","bring","life","veri","styliz","repeat","rest","consequ","startl","time","quarter","onc","know","drill","practic","fall","asleep","grudg","grow","predict","minut","conclud","lot","well","genr","begin","socal","predecessor","ring","wai","scari","bui","ticket","grudg","wast","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,15,20,23,26,33,38,40,58,59,72,75,89,126,147,169,212,226,236,250,337,347,396,467,561,691,917,986,1077,1084,1346,1437,1785,2218,2306,2347,3229,3320,3485,4362,4870,5051,5426],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,8,15,20,23,26,33,38,40,58,59,72,75,89,126,147,169,212,226,236,250,337,347,396,467,561,691,917,986,1077,1084,1346,1437,1785,2218,2306,2347,3229,3320,3485,4362,4870,5051,5426],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9418936859054116,2.4001215597131385,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.865701314626681,1.8693254449200722,1.9209463754160525,1.9742250248702675,1.9940046109572438,2.2391270689902285,2.2844323215331563,2.4071371113909277,2.5983793339432615,2.5940874818617203,2.617923930016232,2.6812935439488212,2.973659465713028,3.0151989841543516,6.583053029006414,3.342254038012865,3.4725585804672896,3.5929222627171646,3.9363956947973615,4.039936373738201,4.235066888824737,4.224077767249142,4.416284083275639,4.4919214974812585,4.770124825978496,5.014723312293965,5.0768550934009715,5.064116067623542,5.5623629091826725,5.583416318380505,17.63464757580345,5.999576715605417,6.0662680901040895,6.137727054086234,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5080846097278283E-4,2.505862069158131E-4,2.5064807858603353E-4,2.5059769030472617E-4,2.5062140640359234E-4,2.505848252590656E-4,2.506627606186685E-4,2.505475423240713E-4,2.5058625987464623E-4,2.5084521362060507E-4,2.5283559737960344E-4,2.505866737783477E-4,2.508239951938731E-4,2.508501267267696E-4,2.507361720640576E-4,2.505986773727581E-4,2.5068489300962495E-4,2.5080286617253593E-4,2.506116147019669E-4,2.506106984410387E-4,2.5083616086100734E-4,2.506358070744792E-4,2.506361863900524E-4,2.507967466145734E-4,2.5061170510388677E-4,2.5085312500494226E-4,2.5067441971278985E-4,2.5058564530012784E-4,2.506992501229477E-4,2.5077576714783415E-4,2.506370364836774E-4,2.507712722224066E-4,2.5089439465660816E-4,2.511272635582013E-4,2.5067398654034516E-4,2.505985253806876E-4,2.506888803013838E-4,2.5062397600113847E-4,2.5054780973712956E-4,2.5061153709162804E-4,2.508626926787702E-4,2.507250787007574E-4,2.5077184368692913E-4,2.505602794736536E-4,2.506116008157933E-4,2.50598431146074E-4,2.5068325644292286E-4,2.5072672523291815E-4,2.5067574137014497E-4,2.506360088222566E-4,2.5059905085673804E-4,2.5111248761528843E-4,2.50662108796618E-4,2.5061154337593255E-4,2.506607664081854E-4,2.5058590168330804E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867695E-4,2.5059940266573095E-4,2.50585758642485E-4,2.507862332604839E-4,2.5068556137980256E-4,2.505856538910582E-4,2.5056017738972995E-4,2.5053498079616126E-4,2.507615040780929E-4,2.505979299011483E-4,2.507118423993319E-4,2.507854199692584E-4,2.506716435043772E-4,2.506118753026198E-4,2.5056050585742603E-4,2.506246038642505E-4,2.505603709024343E-4,2.505735199054816E-4,2.505605129489129E-4,2.507231617352093E-4,2.5064853849859876E-4,2.5058598835840613E-4,2.5061026230912794E-4]}}
{"value":"Another movie that relies upon the trite, worn-out cliché of the mad scientist gone madder. The movie centers around a surgeon whose life's ambition is to bring the dead...back to life. I know, I know...you've never heard that one before! Of course, as all of these movies go, the experiment goes very, very wrong and creates a maniacal, bloodthirsty creature. For this promising setup, you'd think that it'd be at least a bit suspenseful. Wrong. Like many movies of this era, the idea is nice, but the execution and the script is mediocre. Not the worst horror movie I've seen (no, Abominator: the Evilmaker 2 still takes the cake)...but not one of the gems, either.","finished_norm":["anoth","movi","that","reli","upon","the","trite","wornout","cliché","of","the","mad","scientist","go","mad","the","movi","center","around","a","surgeon","whose","life","ambit","be","to","bring","the","deadback","to","life","i","know","i","knowyouv","never","hear","that","on","befor","of","cours","a","all","of","thi","movi","go","the","experi","go","veri","veri","wrong","and","creat","a","maniac","bloodthirsti","creatur","for","thi","promis","setup","you","have","think","that","it","have","be","at","littl","a","bite","suspens","wrong","like","mani","movi","of","thi","era","the","idea","be","nice","but","the","execut","and","the","script","be","mediocr","not","the","wrong","horror","movi","i","have","see","no","abomin","the","evilmak","still","take","the","cakebut","not","on","of","the","gem","either"],"filtered":["anoth","movi","reli","upon","trite","wornout","cliché","mad","scientist","go","mad","movi","center","around","surgeon","whose","life","ambit","bring","deadback","life","know","knowyouv","never","hear","befor","cours","thi","movi","go","experi","go","veri","veri","wrong","creat","maniac","bloodthirsti","creatur","thi","promis","setup","think","littl","bite","suspens","wrong","like","mani","movi","thi","era","idea","nice","execut","script","mediocr","wrong","horror","movi","see","abomin","evilmak","still","take","cakebut","gem","either"],"filtered2":["anoth","reli","upon","trite","wornout","cliché","mad","scientist","go","mad","center","around","surgeon","whose","life","ambit","bring","deadback","life","know","knowyouv","never","hear","befor","cours","go","experi","go","veri","veri","wrong","creat","maniac","bloodthirsti","creatur","promis","setup","think","littl","bite","suspens","wrong","like","mani","era","idea","nice","execut","script","mediocr","wrong","horror","see","abomin","evilmak","still","take","cakebut","gem","either"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,12,14,15,25,26,31,42,50,64,73,75,77,79,83,98,123,154,199,207,216,250,262,333,362,523,529,598,630,662,683,761,787,805,831,1204,1314,1426,1752,1985,2015,2452,2616,3293,4251,5257],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,12,14,15,25,26,31,42,50,64,73,75,77,79,83,98,123,154,199,207,216,250,262,333,362,523,529,598,630,662,683,761,787,805,831,1204,1314,1426,1752,1985,2015,2452,2616,3293,4251,5257],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,2.912480743411154,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,3.838916364248105,1.3324924169710188,1.4070669811451506,1.6219954307453837,1.717994385570355,1.883428577602134,1.8950689206770979,3.948450049740535,1.9463902258768238,1.9469506069506084,2.292318797740072,2.0881990796736947,2.2619070973220485,2.348499626138016,2.558331832813986,2.5531798379045583,2.6070186965339692,2.6812935439488212,2.726701583487816,2.948928684455311,3.058539100262467,3.4986697244709752,3.4648563601051974,3.5642670069567886,3.558633189238533,3.616452760127359,3.6105180246075443,3.9405024767500145,3.760240652919071,4.096025840389245,7.856464768316401,4.3215761317340196,4.4637506205145625,4.449957298382227,4.715065048795469,4.869215728622727,4.979216623837056,5.339219357868463,5.2288713006995975,5.583416318380505,5.907203395474402,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805352E-4,2.1925531043720596E-4,2.193094462670603E-4,2.1926535805328186E-4,2.1928610891855596E-4,2.1925410152956963E-4,2.1932229259911848E-4,2.1922148009526646E-4,2.192553567745744E-4,2.194819334272078E-4,2.2122345888285364E-4,2.192557189277259E-4,2.1946336794909403E-4,2.1948623224568855E-4,2.1938652538130762E-4,2.1926622170779188E-4,2.1934165776813392E-4,2.1944488069798178E-4,2.1927754147741058E-4,2.1927673977696293E-4,2.194740125378646E-4,2.1929870906764104E-4,2.1929904095723218E-4,2.1943952627086736E-4,2.1927762057634122E-4,2.1948885564790856E-4,2.1933249395190822E-4,2.1925481904056074E-4,2.1935421980567507E-4,2.1942116987548016E-4,2.1929978476330173E-4,2.1941723695242693E-4,2.1952496533805872E-4,2.1972871854514218E-4,2.193321149391924E-4,2.1926608871935253E-4,2.1934514652716483E-4,2.192883572382644E-4,2.192217140735601E-4,2.192774735707243E-4,2.1949722707154408E-4,2.1937681902578184E-4,2.1941773696650523E-4,2.1923262471379968E-4,2.1927752932743096E-4,2.1926600626693136E-4,2.193402258220395E-4,2.193782596913496E-4,2.1933365036190083E-4,2.1929888559081088E-4,2.192665484949163E-4,2.1971579004444682E-4,2.193217222746469E-4,2.1927747906929965E-4,2.19320547725592E-4,2.192550433680465E-4,0.9826707519942608,2.1928925081630268E-4,2.1926685631708614E-4,2.1925491821167634E-4,2.1943032740576223E-4,2.1934224257171345E-4,2.1925482655736354E-4,2.1923253539347094E-4,2.192104891403557E-4,2.1940869012321293E-4,2.1926556769286484E-4,2.1936523766456566E-4,2.1942961580067298E-4,2.193

{"value":"This oddity in the new DORIS DAY COLLECTION doesn't really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes. What she does do however, is shine when she's on screen. The near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some Warner contract players of the day. JANCIE RULE shows promise and it's a shame she didn't become a big star. RUTH ROMAN handles the role of the \"go-getter\" with aplomb. Better if this was in color. The Travis Air force base locations with some rear projection work well.

{"value":"I was lying on my bed, with a really bad cold or flu or whatever. I figure maybe I'd kill some time watching some horror movies my mom bought for me a little while ago. I wish I never picked this movie! After I watched it I felt even more sick and I wanted to throw up. Afterwords(when I got better of course) I did some research on Dennis L.Rader and I noticed that the Dennis in the movie was nothing like the real one. I hope that no one ever watches this movie but if they ever do don't eat or you'll feel the way I felt after I first watched it. I think you would have a better time watching The Santa Claus 3. At least that movie had better reviews on this site.","finished_norm":["i","be","lie","on","my","bed","with","a","realli","bad","cold","or","flu","or","whatev","i","figur","mayb","i","have","kill","some","time","watch","some","horror","movi","my","mom","bui","for","me","a","littl","while","ago","i","wish","i","never","pick","thi","movi","after","i","watch","it","i","feel","even","much","sick","and","i","want","to","throw","up","afterwordswhen","i","get","well","of","cours","i","do","some","research","on","denni","lrader","and","i","notic","that","the","denni","in","the","movi","be","noth","like","the","real","on","i","hope","that","no","on","ever","watch","thi","movi","but","if","thei","ever","do","do","not","eat","or","you","will","feel","the","wai","i","feel","after","i","watch","it","i","think","you","would","have","a","well","time","watch","the","santa","clau","at","littl","that","movi","have","well","review","on","thi","site"],"filtered":["lie","bed","realli","bad","cold","flu","whatev","figur","mayb","kill","time","watch","horror","movi","mom","bui","littl","ago","wish","never","pick","thi","movi","watch","feel","even","much","sick","want","throw","afterwordswhen","get","well","cours","research","denni","lrader","notic","denni","movi","noth","like","real","hope","ever","watch","thi","movi","thei","ever","eat","feel","wai","feel","watch","think","well","time","watch","santa","clau","littl","movi","well","review","thi","site"],"filtered2":["lie","bed","realli","bad","cold","flu","whatev","figur","mayb","kill","time","watch","horror","mom","bui","littl","ago","wish","never","pick","watch","feel","even","sick","want","throw","afterwordswhen","get","well","cours","research","denni","lrader","notic","denni","noth","like","real","hope","ever","watch","ever","eat","feel","wai","feel","watch","think","well","time","watch","santa","clau","littl","well","review","site"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,7,8,9,12,13,14,20,33,37,42,43,44,49,76,80,83,163,176,181,199,310,347,399,415,446,557,599,610,650,688,778,1065,1106,1121,1131,1179,1511,2646,2685,8160],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,7,8,9,12,13,14,20,33,37,42,43,44,49,76,80,83,163,176,181,199,310,347,399,415,446,557,599,610,650,688,778,1065,1106,1121,1131,1179,1511,2646,2685,8160],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,4.804748860361466,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.2350163994518417,3.4960351200691706,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.6219954307453837,4.982433610865464,3.209458785004948,1.6920303308087352,2.1337665533324026,1.9951803900462557,2.292318797740072,2.4000574358028657,2.5040471493269134,2.4442286541160034,2.558331832813986,2.854312708080462,3.0151989841543516,3.129115117668582,3.1588018988486244,3.233054746047873,3.4471119148061256,3.6254214301101193,3.477726550625732,3.6621227969605474,3.6016814428070463,3.8059428063999263,4.1302590120314875,4.213208095012239,4.403125998698128,5.02684467282631,4.390138803171316,4.581533656170946,10.852461469716184,5.672363804397,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805374E-4,2.1925531043720617E-4,2.1930944626706052E-4,2.192653580532821E-4,2.1928610891855618E-4,2.1925410152956985E-4,2.193222925991187E-4,2.1922148009526668E-4,2.192553567745746E-4,2.1948193342720803E-4,2.2122345868647727E-4,2.1925571892772612E-4,2.1946336794909424E-4,2.194862322456888E-4,2.1938652538130787E-4,2.1926622170779212E-4,2.1934165776813414E-4,2.19444880697982E-4,2.192775414774108E-4,2.1927673977696318E-4,2.194740125378648E-4,2.1929870906764126E-4,2.192990409572324E-4,2.1943952627086758E-4,2.1927762057634146E-4,2.1948885564790878E-4,2.1933249395190846E-4,2.1925481904056096E-4,2.193542198056753E-4,2.1942116987548038E-4,2.1929978476330198E-4,2.1941723695242715E-4,2.1952496533805897E-4,2.197287185451424E-4,2.193321149391926E-4,2.1926608871935274E-4,2.1934514652716504E-4,2.1928835723826462E-4,2.192217140735603E-4,2.1927747357072455E-4,2.194972270715443E-4,2.1937681902578206E-4,2.1941773696650544E-4,2.192326247137999E-4,2.1927752932743118E-4,2.192660062669316E-4,2.1934022582203972E-4,2.193782596913498E-4,2.1933365036190105E-4,2.192988855908111E-4,2.1926654849491653E-4,2.1971579004444704E-4,2.1932172227464712E-4,2.1927747906929986E-4,2.193205477255922E-4,2.1925504336804672E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.192892508163029E-4,2.1926685631708638E-4,2.1925491821167656E-4,2.1943032740576245E-4,2.193422425717137E-4,2.1925482655736376E-4,2.1923253539347118E-4,2.1921048914035592E-4,2.1940869012321314E-4,2.1926556769286506E-4,2.1936523766456588E-4,2.1942961580067322E-4,2.1933006485397508E-4,2.1927776949505693E-4,2.1923282279271615E-4,2.1928890659939364E-4,2.1923270471120254E-4,2.1924420968899263E-4,2.1923282899755146E-4,2.1937514173922464E-4,2.1930984867656863E-4,2.1925511920612166E-4

{"value":"This movie is the biggest steaming pile of you know what, Being from and growing up in Wichita Kansas;I know for a fact 90% of the movie was Bogus. Aside from the names of some of the victims, nothing else much was correct. The movie looks like it was made with dad's handy-cam, It had footage that I believe came from another film along with stock footage from a slaughter house. I usually enjoy watching bad films for the fun of it, but due to the bad acting, poorly prepared or non existent sets and a very dull and short ending.It was a struggle to watch it through to the ending. I recommend that you not waste your money on this film or you will be sorry.

{"value":"There have been very few films I have not been able to sit through. I made it through Battle Field Earth no problem. But this, This is one of the single worst films EVER to be made. I understand Whoopi Goldberg tried to get of acting in it. I do not blame her. I would feel ashamed to have this on a resume. I belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it's face. Well it happens here. Not to mention the SFX, look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end!!!!!! Halfway through the film I was still looking for a plot. I never found one.

{"value":"Slasher films are often seen as the derivative, repetitive and frankly unoriginal. I happen to to be a horror movie fan, but this film was just so poor, words fail me. The script is severely lacking, the plot is ridiculous, the acting astoundingly bad. Just an all round stinker, that I wasted time of my life on. This had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a film that was dire in the first place. <br /><br />Who greenlit this mess?<br /><br />I only liked two things in this movie.

{"value":"If you want to make a movie like this, have the threat be real. Don't surround your patsy with a bunch of Bonzos. There is no credibility here. The plot is dull and unbelievable. The acting is even worse. I thought that I was watching Arthur Lake (Dagwood) who is one of the worst actors in history, when I saw the main character. Oh well, at some point he has to face the music and get fighting mad. I don't care. Do you? There are all these long scenes set in this austere office (the furniture made out of cardboard or masonite). People talk and smoke and don't do anything. Most of the action happens in a five minute sequence. After that, it's over.

It was particularly sad to see a talented actor like George Eads in such a disgraceful and tacky film. Lifetime you have sunken to whole new low. Someone needs to make sure that this director never works in movies again. Also was this supposed to be a horror film because it was a lot more funny than scary. For shame Lifetime, For shame.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","a","confus","piec","of","garbag","you","never","know","what","be","go","on","the","charact","be","poorli","write","and","for","the","much","part","thei","be","total","unsympathet","except","for","gu","plai","masterfulli","by","georg","ead","i","hate","thi","movi","but","compar","to","other","dark","harvest","dracula","curs","it","should","have","win","a","academi","award","it","be","particularli","sad","to","see","a","talent","actor","like","georg","ead","in","such","a","disgrac","and","tacki","film","lifetim","you","have","sink","to","whole","new","low","someon","ne","to","make","sure","that","thi","director","never","work","in","movi","again","conjur","be","thi","suppos","to","be","a","horror","film","becaus","it","be","a","lot","much","funni","than","scari","for","shame","lifetim","for","shame"],"filtered":["thi","movi","confus","piec","garbag","never","know","go","charact","poorli","write","much","part","thei","total","unsympathet","except","gu","plai","masterfulli","georg","ead","hate","thi","movi","compar","dark","harvest","dracula","curs","win","academi","award","particularli","sad","see","talent","actor","like","georg","ead","disgrac","tacki","film","lifetim","sink","whole","new","low","someon","ne","make","sure","thi","director","never","work","movi","conjur","thi","suppos","horror","film","becaus","lot","much","funni","scari","shame","lifetim","shame"],"filtered2":["confus","piec","garbag","never","know","go","charact","poorli","write","part","total","unsympathet","except","gu","plai","masterfulli","georg","ead","hate","compar","dark","harvest","dracula","curs","win","academi","award","particularli","sad","see","talent","actor","like","georg","ead","disgrac","tacki","lifetim","sink","whole","new","low","someon","ne","make","sure","director","never","work","conjur","suppos","horror","becaus","lot","funni","scari","shame","lifetim","shame"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,10,22,26,39,40,41,42,48,58,61,62,65,72,83,87,110,111,119,139,149,184,217,218,232,276,339,368,396,398,427,455,482,489,497,574,680,702,1004,1359,1566,1880,2041,2145,2544,3034,3830,5595,6367,7451],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,10,22,26,39,40,41,42,48,58,61,62,65,72,83,87,110,111,119,139,149,184,217,218,232,276,339,368,396,398,427,455,482,489,497,574,680,702,1004,1359,1566,1880,2041,2145,2544,3034,3830,5595,6367,7451],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,3.2439908614907673,1.6955116224012472,1.865701314626681,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,1.9073850067444174,1.9209463754160525,2.292318797740072,2.115024371522662,2.1290479736304078,2.1183455303375887,2.1653408989309972,2.2939035841256437,2.3253197803590226,2.496249838866882,2.6113665294700725,2.5940874818617203,2.6102777977348763,2.7884729505849193,3.003844442051426,3.1346146732346205,3.291526514503207,3.143848349181566,3.233054746047873,3.2787058260741455,3.3154667220492153,3.3956930001684253,3.342254038012865,7.007949553401337,7.619092827806449,3.6466665387238555,4.176068548062782,4.456830177669989,4.74221603786142,4.933754249760298,9.935311602871959,5.626901430320244,5.156897801074508,5.463272006538442,5.719991853386255,6.660975197850782,6.600350576034347,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612976E-4,2.1169300653874429E-4,2.1174527517734868E-4,2.1170270760391538E-4,2.1172274275403053E-4,2.1169183932737026E-4,2.1175767842838498E-4,2.116603430343433E-4,2.116930512778971E-4,2.1191181310725398E-4,2.1359327166514582E-4,2.1169340094007549E-4,2.118938879684197E-4,2.1191596365579459E-4,2.1181969576676942E-4,2.1170354147023986E-4,2.1177637567609513E-4,2.1187603835847054E-4,2.1171447081128582E-4,2.117136967621749E-4,2.119041654161847E-4,2.117349083131558E-4,2.1173522875559E-4,2.1187086861014433E-4,2.1171454718202644E-4,2.1191849657461968E-4,2.1176752792775863E-4,2.1169253209079125E-4,2.1178850443817634E-4,2.1185314534259394E-4,2.1173594690714965E-4,2.1184934806943342E-4,2.1195336081055463E-4,2.121500863945936E-4,2.1176716198751676E-4,2.1170341306868593E-4,2.1177974410483178E-4,2.1172491352726194E-4,2.1166056894252473E-4,2.1171440524675946E-4,2.1192657926066673E-4,2.1181032419177907E-4,2.1184983083759687E-4,2.1167110326541513E-4,2.1171445908036942E-4,2.1170333346011959E-4,2.1177499311905089E-4,2.1181171516755453E-4,2.1176864445217775E-4,2.1173507874788997E-4,2.1170385698619578E-4,2.12137603808987E-4,2.1175712777489407E-4,2.117144105556842E-4,2.1175599373704447E-4,2.1169274868102942E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502648E-4,2.1170415419131472E-4,2.1169262784140994E-4,2.118619870217943

my little sister's elementary school talent show provides greater range and depth of emotion. and those fake irish accents were like nails on a chalk board. the only thing that could have made this

{"value":"Oh my god. the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me. besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old. the plot, the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace.<br /><br />I am not usually this critical about any movie, cause every person has his/her style. But this movie, however, was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008. I can honestly believe that this movie is unknown, and i think it should stay like this, for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke.<br /><br />I advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies, or even simply movies to stay far away from this one.","finished_norm":["oh","my","god","the","idea","that","thi","movi","be","a","thriller","be","a","absolut","joke","to","me","besid","the","point","that","it","seem","to","be","write","by","a","year","old","the","plot","the","act","and","even","the","prop","and","film","of","thi","movi","be","all","beyond","disgracebr","br","i","be","not","usual","thi","critic","about","ani","movi","caus","everi","person","have","hisher","styl","but","thi","movi","howev","be","probabl","the","wrong","movi","i","have","see","in","i","can","honestli","believ","that","thi","movi","be","unknown","and","i","think","it","should","stai","like","thi","for","movi","like","thi","be","make","the","thriller","genr","a","jokebr","br","i","advis","anyon","that","be","a","fan","of","thriller","movi","or","even","simpli","movi","to","stai","far","awai","from","thi","on"],"filtered":["oh","god","idea","thi","movi","thriller","absolut","joke","besid","point","seem","write","year","old","plot","act","even","prop","film","thi","movi","beyond","disgracebr","br","usual","thi","critic","ani","movi","caus","everi","person","hisher","styl","thi","movi","howev","probabl","wrong","movi","see","honestli","believ","thi","movi","unknown","think","stai","like","thi","movi","like","thi","make","thriller","genr","jokebr","br","advis","anyon","fan","thriller","movi","even","simpli","movi","stai","far","awai","thi"],"filtered2":["oh","god","idea","thriller","absolut","joke","besid","point","seem","write","year","old","plot","act","even","prop","beyond","disgracebr","usual","critic","ani","caus","everi","person","hisher","styl","howev","probabl","wrong","see","honestli","believ","unknown","think","stai","like","like","make","thriller","genr","jokebr","advis","anyon","fan","thriller","even","simpli","stai","far","awai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,12,21,25,27,32,35,57,65,66,67,85,91,101,113,123,140,148,153,155,158,201,214,222,234,265,352,366,380,452,467,502,579,714,757,972,1512,2043,2056,6261,6427],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,12,21,25,27,32,35,57,65,66,67,85,91,101,113,123,140,148,153,155,158,201,214,222,234,265,352,366,380,452,467,502,579,714,757,972,1512,2043,2056,6261,6427],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.852034211452262,1.066728610262888,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.834162586674748,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,1.9570915389266579,2.011190219103739,2.0105926690411424,2.098582041218749,2.1521782565202803,2.2619070973220485,2.317169775997098,2.3018654096236517,2.3409902041158843,2.3074766467914385,2.3106972614914807,2.561435818751577,2.7303758068497004,2.5771019354959765,2.673149229007135,2.73529586597515,3.1236456418640466,6.01738979237035,3.102062070196872,3.2872346624216657,3.342254038012865,3.3132665011396125,3.5642670069567886,11.189344336303087,3.7165362186843414,3.9911462095687695,4.566029469634981,4.900964426937307,4.933754249760298,6.437831646536572,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815707E-4,2.4557311712357507E-4,2.4563375102320054E-4,2.455843707821273E-4,2.456076124297672E-4,2.455717631074923E-4,2.456481393351682E-4,2.4553522603438377E-4,2.455731690229429E-4,2.4582694228272693E-4,2.4777750751927874E-4,2.4557357464631465E-4,2.458061483401666E-4,2.458317570999926E-4,2.457200821515691E-4,2.4558533810341916E-4,2.4566982895768755E-4,2.4578544201440586E-4,2.455980166155375E-4,2.455971186848213E-4,2.4581807062765723E-4,2.456217250087551E-4,2.4562209673594963E-4,2.4577944488095315E-4,2.455981052089263E-4,2.4583469539626163E-4,2.4565956518386695E-4,2.4557256674326424E-4,2.4568389885049996E-4,2.457588851178834E-4,2.4562292982306926E-4,2.45754480115461E-4,2.4587513942998134E-4,2.461033496844451E-4,2.4565914067723187E-4,2.4558518915201847E-4,2.4567373648188114E-4,2.4561013062135857E-4,2.4553548809772355E-4,2.455979405578284E-4,2.4584407166447074E-4,2.457092107159919E-4,2.457550401475787E-4,2.455477083715591E-4,2.45598003007163E-4,2.455850968026107E-4,2.4566822513123857E-4,2.4571082430853615E-4,2.456608604008721E-4,2.456219227204774E-4,2.4558570411568415E-4,2.4608886934091695E-4,2.45647500553111E-4,2.455979467164125E-4,2.4564618501976283E-4,2.455728179973836E-4,0.9805906755843552,2.4561113145798053E-4,2.4558604888657985E-4,2.4557267781815653E-4,2.4576914185124154E-4,2.4567048395681914E-4,2.4557257516232917E-4,2.4554760832987024E-4,2.455229158054903E-4,2.4574490738726835E-4,2.455846055853152E-4,2.456962392127306E-4,2.457683448302728E-4,2.456568445147524E-4,2.455982720027571E-4,2.455479302264223E-4,2.4561074592378666E-4,2.455477979712659E-4,2.455606839225923E-4,2.4554793717604075E-4,2.4570733210020195E-4,2.4563420173500804E-4,2.4557290293850733E-4,2.4559669127792563E-4]}}
{"value":"I thought this was a truly awful film--I found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times. One or both of the gay male leads was miscast; there was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo looked like he'd rather be kissing a dog. The movie covers their long and tortured courtship, highlighting each break-up and make-up, but not developing the reasons in-between in any detail. These reasons would make for some interesting characters, not the fight or the make-up scene in bed (lame even if you liked the movie).<br /><br />Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters, but it doesn't make the film worth renting.

This movie was just a plain, steaming, stinking pile of POO, that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible. Something else I have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. What is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie?

{"value":"I wouldn't bring a child under 8 to see this. With puppies dangling off of buildings squirming through dangerous machines and listening to Cruella's scary laugh to name a few of the events there is entirely too much suspense for a small child. <br /><br />The live action gives a more ominous feel than the cartoon version and there are quite a few disquieting moments including some guy that seems to be a transvestite, a lot of tense moments that will worry and may frighten small kids.<br /><br />I don't know what the Disney folks were thinking but neither the story nor the acting were of their usual level. The puppies are cute But this movie is spotty at best.","finished_norm":["i","would","not","bring","a","child","under","to","see","thi","with","puppi","dangl","off","of","build","squirm","through","danger","machin","and","listen","to","cruella","scari","laugh","to","name","a","few","of","the","event","there","be","entir","too","much","suspens","for","a","small","child","br","br","the","live","action","give","a","much","omin","feel","than","the","cartoon","version","and","there","be","quit","a","few","disquiet","moment","includ","some","gui","that","seem","to","be","a","transvestit","a","lot","of","tens","moment","that","will","worri","and","mai","frighten","small","kidsbr","br","i","do","not","know","what","the","disnei","folk","be","think","but","neither","the","stori","nor","the","act","be","of","their","usual","level","the","puppi","be","cute","but","thi","movi","be","spotti","at","well"],"filtered":["bring","child","see","thi","puppi","dangl","build","squirm","danger","machin","listen","cruella","scari","laugh","name","event","entir","much","suspens","small","child","br","br","live","action","give","much","omin","feel","cartoon","version","quit","disquiet","moment","includ","gui","seem","transvestit","lot","tens","moment","worri","mai","frighten","small","kidsbr","br","know","disnei","folk","think","neither","stori","act","usual","level","puppi","cute","thi","movi","spotti","well"],"filtered2":["bring","child","see","puppi","dangl","build","squirm","danger","machin","listen","cruella","scari","laugh","name","event","entir","suspens","small","child","live","action","give","omin","feel","cartoon","version","quit","disquiet","moment","includ","gui","seem","transvestit","lot","tens","moment","worri","mai","frighten","small","kidsbr","know","disnei","folk","think","neither","stori","act","usual","level","puppi","cute","spotti","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,12,17,20,21,26,30,35,43,46,55,72,116,120,129,133,143,180,188,198,220,250,265,301,363,396,445,470,477,529,653,718,841,845,855,978,1008,1071,1404,1710,3281,3962,4706,5470,5748,7254,7989],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,12,17,20,21,26,30,35,43,46,55,72,116,120,129,133,143,180,188,198,220,250,265,301,363,396,445,470,477,529,653,718,841,845,855,978,1008,1071,1404,1710,3281,3962,4706,5470,5748,7254,7989],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.6608112036218214,1.655771293751733,1.9536997889255368,1.9209463754160525,2.2466628996789315,2.2044500422972613,2.4106958340079214,2.3212364753796515,2.3409902041158843,5.419462958538709,5.075762444685391,2.5439726117360975,2.8336934208777267,2.6812935439488212,2.73529586597515,2.8309760279012264,6.069937971110711,3.291526514503207,3.241201430615691,3.3814747511661465,3.351345009714117,3.4648563601051974,3.9911462095687695,3.634471265630037,4.30366520516749,3.831445099210862,3.9201351739255808,4.058285512406398,4.086456389373095,4.30366520516749,4.436351646326448,4.688631791727313,5.604922523601468,11.999153431210834,6.0662680901040895,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918343E-4,2.3612552253122058E-4,2.3618382374676028E-4,2.361363432433456E-4,2.361586907472489E-4,2.3612422060632424E-4,2.3619765851711906E-4,2.3608908917345178E-4,2.361255724339359E-4,2.3636958262639033E-4,2.38245106466731E-4,2.3612596245232116E-4,2.3634958866039737E-4,2.3637421220985635E-4,2.3626683357713384E-4,2.3613727335022446E-4,2.3621851370481583E-4,2.3632967894044422E-4,2.3614946409949669E-4,2.3614860071362597E-4,2.3636105227822522E-4,2.3617226039252115E-4,2.361726178187699E-4,2.3632391252640514E-4,2.3614954928455467E-4,2.363770374651205E-4,2.3620864479495746E-4,2.3612499332492957E-4,2.3623204230611877E-4,2.3630414373063938E-4,2.3617341885568202E-4,2.3629990819577746E-4,2.364159255515169E-4,2.366353561887683E-4,2.3620823661977853E-4,2.361371301292248E-4,2.3622227090024024E-4,2.3616111205994103E-4,2.360893411547914E-4,2.3614939096785055E-4,2.363860530131422E-4,2.3625638038324843E-4,2.3630044668255468E-4,2.3610109129494804E-4,2.3614945101465838E-4,2.3613704133264795E-4,2.3621697158016165E-4,2.3625793189828038E-4,2.3620989018287175E-4,2.361724504979541E-4,2.3613762528140622E-4,2.3662143292745185E-4,2.361970443100397E-4,2.3614939688950401E-4,2.36195779387385E-4,2.3612523491289698E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.361620743927611E-4,2.3613795678840852E-4,2.3612510012659127E-4,2.363140058708933E-4,2.362191435050725E-4,2.3612500142009948E-4,2.3610099510202456E-4,2.3607725253895363E-4,2.362907037459052E-4,2.361365690132755E-4,2.362439079146759E-4,2.3631323951260898E-4,2.3620602879437962E-4,2.3614970966155733E-4,2.361013046146962E-4,2.3616170369069055E-4,2.3610117744760935E-4

{"value":"This film is so bad it simply defies reality. The filming is grade school material at best, the acting is pathetic and the director should forever be banished from film making in any form. So bad it can't even be watched as comedy such something along the lines of Showgirls. The ONLY thing this DVD had going for it was the cover art. <br /><br />All I can write to those of you who haven't had the misfortune to witness this is to please do yourself a well deserved favor in advance and don't waste your time or your money on this piece of garbage. If you want to see a movie for the comedy aspects, there are many other more worthy in such a realm than this

{"value":"I watched this movie when Joe Bob Briggs hosted Monstervision on TNT. Even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable.

{"value":"All right I recently got a chance to rent this and watch Santa Claus conquers the martains. Although the children were much more sadistic in SCCTM, I would have to say that Santa Claus was a much worse movie. As a spanish assignment in Spanish 5 we all had to watch it. I'll tell you, usually when we watch a movie we are all just talking and eating food, but not for this movie. Everyone just kept there jaw open wondering what the evil Mr. Pitch was going to do next. Would Merlin help Santa Claus!?! or would his robot reindeer come and save the day? I would suggest renting it because it is the biggest piece of rubbish I have ever seen and I love it for that.

{"value":"The back of the DVD box says Ellen Page co-stars in this movie. She does not even appear until two thirds of the movie is over and then its in minor role. I don't consider it a supporting role either, but rather a \"bit\" part. Also the plot has many unexplained elements. Some examples are: why does the main character reject her oldest son? Why does her youngest son drive head on into the train? He says its for a \"sucker\" bet which doesn't explain anything. Obviously the screenwriter doesn't know the definition of a sucker bet. This film is not worthy of the rental price in my opinion. Save your money and view it for free on TV if you think it needs to be seen.","finished_norm":["the","back","of","the","dvd","box","sai","ellen","page","costar","in","thi","movi","she","doe","not","even","appear","until","two","third","of","the","movi","be","over","and","then","it","in","minor","role","i","do","not","consid","it","a","support","role","either","but","rather","a","bite","part","conjur","the","plot","have","mani","unexplain","elem","some","exampl","be","why","doe","the","main","charact","reject","her","old","son","why","doe","her","young","son","drive","head","on","into","the","train","he","sai","it","for","a","sucker","bet","which","doe","not","explain","anyth","obvious","the","screenwrit","doe","not","know","the","definit","of","a","sucker","bet","thi","film","be","not","worthi","of","the","rental","price","in","my","opinion","save","your","monei","and","view","it","for","free","on","tv","if","you","think","it","ne","to","be","see"],"filtered":["back","dvd","box","sai","ellen","page","costar","thi","movi","doe","even","appear","two","third","movi","minor","role","consid","support","role","either","rather","bite","part","conjur","plot","mani","unexplain","elem","exampl","doe","main","charact","reject","old","son","doe","young","son","drive","head","train","sai","sucker","bet","doe","explain","anyth","obvious","screenwrit","doe","know","definit","sucker","bet","thi","film","worthi","rental","price","opinion","save","monei","view","free","tv","think","ne","see"],"filtered2":["back","dvd","box","ellen","page","costar","doe","even","appear","two","third","minor","role","consid","support","role","either","rather","bite","part","conjur","plot","mani","unexplain","elem","exampl","doe","main","charact","reject","old","son","doe","young","son","drive","head","train","sucker","bet","doe","explain","anyth","obvious","screenwrit","doe","know","definit","sucker","bet","worthi","rental","price","opinion","save","monei","view","free","tv","think","ne","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,10,12,18,26,32,39,47,50,61,63,67,104,110,126,128,135,154,160,170,172,179,189,207,208,247,307,312,317,341,392,395,434,459,461,479,538,654,686,713,1097,1337,1338,1451,1499,1505,1648,1895,2462,3019,3324,3533,8407],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,10,12,18,26,32,39,47,50,61,63,67,104,110,126,128,135,154,160,170,172,179,189,207,208,247,307,312,317,341,392,395,434,459,461,479,538,654,686,713,1097,1337,1338,1451,1499,1505,1648,1895,2462,3019,3324,3533,8407],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,6.076579967024087,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,1.8818517047392527,1.8729627573220065,1.9570915389266579,2.0728240170322856,2.1290479736304078,2.2391270689902285,4.681980408231769,2.366244071437088,2.348499626138016,2.3722295531801256,2.4214486257841834,2.5001408943598484,2.507968722980095,2.498193474075453,2.5531798379045583,2.6289494000279396,2.7303758068497004,2.8767855639325206,2.8824835850471584,2.8529247828056143,2.933776879434709,3.0670934723591254,3.153168081130368,6.820232654259061,3.2850956241729166,3.358217889001879,3.360519385990158,3.43462735814388,3.634471265630037,3.6016814428070463,3.865219416329466,4.186539847930077,4.396611317676934,4.646072177308517,8.998179973919743,4.605250182788262,4.535724120139652,4.706176101378222,4.85885294158718,5.156897801074508,10.816424458710827,5.999576715605417,5.672363804397,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.950611946162389E-4,1.9488834103030856E-4,1.9493646046718594E-4,1.9489727200317503E-4,1.9491571671815204E-4,1.9488726647479048E-4,1.949478791203449E-4,1.948582704281237E-4,1.9488838221796712E-4,1.9508977824281081E-4,1.96637758853064E-4,1.9488870412317778E-4,1.9507327604168824E-4,1.950935993115021E-4,1.9500497338335564E-4,1.9489803967532102E-4,1.949650921386096E-4,1.950568433737985E-4,1.9490810142076942E-4,1.9490738881741248E-4,1.9508273764260595E-4,1.9492691654791685E-4,1.9492721155291214E-4,1.9505208401168582E-4,1.9490817172902942E-4,1.9509593116155165E-4,1.9495694674437415E-4,1.948879042450978E-4,1.949762580923622E-4,1.9503576765685194E-4,1.9492787269599076E-4,1.95032271819749E-4,1.9512802779626692E-4,1.9530913686235482E-4,1.9495660985328916E-4,1.9489792146657034E-4,1.949681931739206E-4,1.9491771517053712E-4,1.9485847840320714E-4,1.949080410609022E-4,1.951033722258576E-4,1.9499634574500062E-4,1.9503271626469319E-4,1.9486817648792687E-4,1.949080906210795E-4,1.9489784817751049E-4,1.9496381933204346E-4,1.949976263020002E-4,1.9495797463658145E-4,1.9492707345315966E-4,1.9489833014491292E-4,1.952976451723816E-4,1.9494737217896278E-4,1.9490804594839256E-4,1.9494632816358033E-4,1.9488810364191725E-4,0.9845966403807087,1.949185094406559E-4,1.9489860375722313E-4,1.948879

{"value":"This short spoof can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of \"Night of the Living Dead\". Good thing to as I would have never went even a tad out of my way to see it.Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper. In execution, it's a different matter. This short didn't even elicit a chuckle from me. I really never thought I'd say this, but \"Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D\" was a VERY better parody and not nearly as lame or boring.<br /><br />My Grade:

{"value":"Dakota (1988) was another early Lou Diamond Phillips starring vehicle. This film is similar to the later released film Harley. There are a few differences but they're both the same. I don't know which one came first. I guess it'll remain one of the mysteries of life. But they both are troubled \"kids\" who are trying to turn there lives around. Instead of bikes this one involves horses. They're basically the same movie and they're both cheesy as hell. If you're a serious L.D.P. fan then I recommend that you watch them both. You get some extreme mugging and posturing from L.D.P. if you're game then go for it.<br /><br />Not recommended, except for L.D.P.
