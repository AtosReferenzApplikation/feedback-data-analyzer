{"value":"Really bad. Why anyone thinks this is a good film let alone funny is a true mystery. I like comedies as much as the next man and I LOVED \"A Christmas Story.\" The fact that it has the same director and was based on the same writer's memoirs has me completely puzzled as to why this film is such a complete failure on every level. Charles Grodin is woefully miscast as the father for starters. For another it does not seem to have the same pacing -- it just doesn't flow well. Everything seems tired and forced. The joy of life that permeated the first film is completely absent here -- you just want the movie to end. I wouldn't even recommend this movie for curiosity-seekers who enjoyed \"A Christmas Story.\" It's that bad.

{"value":"If it wasn't for some immature gullible idiot I know insisting that I watch this \"documentary\" I would never have seen this comedy! This film is full of bad scripting and laughable moments. One in particular is where the Afghan police / soldiers arrest Don Larson for filming in the streets while they allow the cameraman to carry on filming his arrest and then drive away, still filming, presumably to his plush hotel. Then there's the scene where a car crashes into another car which has been turned upside down and parked nicely on the side of the road without any evidence of it being in a crash or explosion.<br /><br />I am surprised this has currently got the rating it has (5.8 / 10).

By this time the film was half way through, and Yes I am a procrastinator but I always want to see things through until the end. So I stuck it out I watched it all. Not only are the actors not as attractive as in Cruel Intentions, they just aren't convincing. I've seen my nephew cry for attention more convincingly than the supposed lust portrayed on screen in this movie. If you like bad movies with bad acting watch this.","finished_norm":["i","be","mad","anyon","make","thi","movi","i","be","even","much","angri","i","lose","valuabl","minut","of","my","life","sit","still","to","watch","thi","i","can","have","have","a","wax","job","and","be","much","entertain","at","littl","cherri","make","me","laugh","befor","it","hurt","i","be","a","bite","confus","at","but","then","i","catch","on","and","realiz","what","be","go","on","by","thi","time","the","film","be","half","wai","through","and","ye","i","be","a","procrastin","but","i","alwai","want","to","see","thing","through","until","the","end","so","i","stick","it","out","i","watch","it","all","not","onli","be","the","actor","not","a","attract","a","in","cruel","intent","thei","just","be","not","convinc","i","have","see","my","nephew","cry","for","attent","much","convincingli","than","the","suppos","lust","portrai","on","screen","in","thi","movi","if","you","like","bad","movi","with","bad","act","watch","thi"],"filtered":["mad","anyon","make","thi","movi","even","much","angri","lose","valuabl","minut","life","sit","still","watch","thi","wax","job","much","entertain","littl","cherri","make","laugh","befor","hurt","bite","confus","catch","realiz","go","thi","time","film","half","wai","ye","procrastin","alwai","want","see","thing","end","stick","watch","onli","actor","attract","cruel","intent","thei","convinc","see","nephew","cry","attent","much","convincingli","suppos","lust","portrai","screen","thi","movi","like","bad","movi","bad","act","watch","thi"],"filtered2":["mad","anyon","make","even","angri","lose","valuabl","minut","life","sit","still","watch","wax","job","entertain","littl","cherri","make","laugh","befor","hurt","bite","confus","catch","realiz","go","time","half","wai","ye","procrastin","alwai","want","see","thing","end","stick","watch","onli","actor","attract","cruel","intent","convinc","see","nephew","cry","attent","convincingli","suppos","lust","portrai","screen","like","bad","bad","act","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9,11,14,21,24,29,33,37,41,59,64,75,79,133,149,154,158,192,195,197,206,209,221,244,289,405,416,427,469,478,512,636,648,811,831,856,863,1161,1984,3092,3143,3880,5066,5149,7905],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,7,8,9,11,14,21,24,29,33,37,41,59,64,75,79,133,149,154,158,192,195,197,206,209,221,244,289,405,416,427,469,478,512,636,648,811,831,856,863,1161,1984,3092,3143,3880,5066,5149,7905],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.8693254449200722,1.883428577602134,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,2.3212364753796515,2.3253197803590226,2.348499626138016,2.3106972614914807,2.5318267134339894,2.51289241584188,2.558331832813986,2.597304642813496,2.6026896854443837,2.6423424573643777,2.634508058031767,2.8282659991423613,3.109204957709252,3.1401446412440817,3.233054746047873,3.328770687675578,3.3243163373261977,3.369778711402955,3.530930586689197,3.6105180246075443,3.8425769395797067,3.9282323841582003,3.900174431363043,3.944626193933877,4.327618446189983,5.014723312293965,5.482320201509136,5.501738287366237,5.770002273960917,6.214688095222362,6.1754673820690815,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612962E-4,2.1169300653874412E-4,2.1174527517734855E-4,2.1170270760391521E-4,2.1172274275403036E-4,2.116918393273701E-4,2.117576784283848E-4,2.1166034303434314E-4,2.1169305127789696E-4,2.1191181310725382E-4,2.1359327166514566E-4,2.1169340094007535E-4,2.1189388796841958E-4,2.1191596365579442E-4,2.1181969576676926E-4,2.117035414702397E-4,2.1177637567609497E-4,2.118760383584704E-4,2.1171447081128565E-4,2.1171369676217477E-4,2.1190416541618453E-4,2.1173490831315566E-4,2.1173522875558986E-4,2.118708686101442E-4,2.1171454718202628E-4,2.1191849657461954E-4,2.1176752792775847E-4,2.1169253209079108E-4,2.1178850443817618E-4,2.1185314534259377E-4,2.1173594690714948E-4,2.1184934806943326E-4,2.119533608105545E-4,2.1215008639459347E-4,2.117671619875166E-4,2.1170341306868577E-4,2.1177974410483162E-4,2.1172491352726178E-4,2.1166056894252457E-4,2.1171440524675933E-4,2.119265792606666E-4,2.1181032419177894E-4,2.118498308375967E-4,2.1167110326541496E-4,2.1171445908036929E-4,2.1170333346011942E-4,2.1177499311905072E-4,2.1181171516755436E-4,2.1176864445217759E-4,2.117350787478898E-4,2.1170385698619562E-4,2.1213760380898682E-4,2.117571277748939E-4,2.1171441055568404E-4,2.117559937370443E-4,2.116927486810293E-4,0.9832684526361813,2.1172577628502631E-4,2.1170415419131456E-4,2.1169262784140978E-4,2.118619870217942

{"value":"This movie is just lame. A total waste of time and money. The jokes are predictable, the characters are so cliché and the way it talks about RPG gamers is not funny as well. The problem is that the writers seems not to know how a RPG game works and, most important, how to make jokes about this game. Of course there are a bunch of losers who play RPG like freaking retards and total losers. But for me this is not the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story doesn't make any sense at all. Who cares about how long a game is being played? The greatest problem in this movie is that the writers and actors didn't even try to know what RPG is about to make jokes about it. I felt ashamed by watching this lame movie.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","just","lame","a","total","wast","of","time","and","monei","the","joke","be","predict","the","charact","be","so","cliché","and","the","wai","it","talk","about","rpg","gamer","be","not","funni","a","good","the","problem","be","that","the","writer","seem","not","to","know","how","a","rpg","game","work","and","much","import","how","to","make","joke","about","thi","game","of","cours","there","be","a","bunch","of","loser","who","plai","rpg","like","freak","retard","and","total","loser","but","for","me","thi","be","not","the","funni","wai","to","make","joke","about","thi","game","the","stori","doe","not","make","ani","sens","at","all","who","care","about","how","long","a","game","be","be","plai","the","great","problem","in","thi","movi","be","that","the","writer","and","actor","do","not","even","try","to","know","what","rpg","be","about","to","make","joke","about","it","i","feel","asham","by","watch","thi","lame","movi"],"filtered":["thi","movi","lame","total","wast","time","monei","joke","predict","charact","cliché","wai","talk","rpg","gamer","funni","good","problem","writer","seem","know","rpg","game","work","much","import","make","joke","thi","game","cours","bunch","loser","plai","rpg","like","freak","retard","total","loser","thi","funni","wai","make","joke","thi","game","stori","doe","make","ani","sens","care","long","game","plai","great","problem","thi","movi","writer","actor","even","try","know","rpg","make","joke","feel","asham","watch","thi","lame","movi"],"filtered2":["lame","total","wast","time","monei","joke","predict","charact","cliché","wai","talk","rpg","gamer","funni","good","problem","writer","seem","know","rpg","game","work","import","make","joke","game","cours","bunch","loser","plai","rpg","like","freak","retard","total","loser","funni","wai","make","joke","game","stori","doe","make","ani","sens","care","long","game","plai","great","problem","writer","actor","even","try","know","rpg","make","joke","feel","asham","watch","lame"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,7,8,10,17,18,26,27,33,35,36,40,41,43,48,51,62,89,99,126,167,173,184,186,199,205,214,287,337,373,374,419,523,600,1313,1524,1575,1584],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,7,8,10,17,18,26,27,33,35,36,40,41,43,48,51,62,89,99,126,167,173,184,186,199,205,214,287,337,373,374,419,523,600,1313,1524,1575,1584],"values":[2.479906862482093,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,2.6649848339420377,1.3002700588679295,2.803707089537043,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,3.2569937516641474,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,4.045224089013853,1.9940046109572438,2.056430207256609,2.2391270689902285,4.9219153375776195,2.4368824319140248,4.992499677733764,2.571852579609833,2.558331832813986,2.571852579609833,10.921503227398802,5.68378037616381,2.973659465713028,6.141071633100196,13.828852043170517,3.1758963322079246,3.4986697244709752,3.558633189238533,4.409683399244287,9.394730943392135,4.733083554298147,4.597282013139085]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0481646893745153E-4,2.0463497070976415E-4,2.0468549666480035E-4,2.0464434833267006E-4,2.0466371549280452E-4,2.046338424142704E-4,2.0469748638025676E-4,2.0460339623606916E-4,2.0463501395727327E-4,2.0484648206987085E-4,2.0647187928241837E-4,2.0463535196139915E-4,2.0482915457133751E-4,2.0485049423537845E-4,2.0475743600462698E-4,2.0464515439713897E-4,2.0471556024485946E-4,2.048119000834881E-4,2.046557193440939E-4,2.0465497110247873E-4,2.0483908935972162E-4,2.0467547544121271E-4,2.0467578519980703E-4,2.0480690269923527E-4,2.0465579316856515E-4,2.0485294270440471E-4,2.0470700748843502E-4,2.0463451208033393E-4,2.0472728462307024E-4,2.0478977034141504E-4,2.0467647940754574E-4,2.0478609967276764E-4,2.0488664453525884E-4,2.0507681111083868E-4,2.0470665374897098E-4,2.0464503027660868E-4,2.0471881636714302E-4,2.0466581389049792E-4,2.04603614612268E-4,2.0465565596554803E-4,2.0486075590640668E-4,2.0474837688640193E-4,2.0478656634500495E-4,2.0461379771132907E-4,2.0465570800429688E-4,2.0464495332226377E-4,2.0471422378351444E-4,2.0474972148579006E-4,2.0470808678692268E-4,2.0467564019349904E-4,2.0464545939350828E-4,2.0506474470589805E-4,2.0469695408605005E-4,2.0465566109746842E-4,2.046958578580455E-4,2.0463472144925814E-4,0.9838262975206153,2.046666478831402E-4,2.0464574668954037E-4,2.046346046385406E-4,2.047983172310539E-4,2.047161060526811E-4,2.0463451909590277E-4,2.0461371434704102E-4,2.0459313817786407E-4,2.0477812276154764E-4,2.0464454399310737E-4,2.047375677912492E-4,2.0479765307707606E-4,2.0470474036713495E-4,2.0465593215711198E-4,2.0461398258198577E-4,2.0466632661923556E-4,2.0461387237436055E-4,2.046246

{"value":"I watched this video at a friend's house. I'm glad I did not waste money buying this one. The video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie Capricorn One. The movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow-ups, most not related to manned flight. Sibrel's smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast. He edits in his own voice-over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say. The video curiously ends with a showing of the Zapruder film. His claims about radiation, shielding, star photography, and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against NASA, the astronauts, or American in general. His science is bad, and so is this

{"value":"The worst movie I have seen in quite a while. Interesting first half with some engaging, terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late-night bar. The movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock (read disgust) without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else.<br /><br />I wanted to walk out, but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect. Still, time is precious (as the director himself observed in his intro) and I really begrudge the time I wasted on the second half of this one.<br /><br />Saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie, especially the female

{"value":"This movie was extremely boring. It should least not more than 15 minutes. The images of child and animal being killed were little bit disturbing.<br /><br />Usually I don't write comments but this one was so bad having so many good and excellent comments. I think in this case we are one step closer to honest assessment of this title.<br /><br />What more can I say? I fall asleep during this movie 3 times. It was about 4 hours after I had woken up from 8 hours long sleeping period. I think it is the point itself.<br /><br />There is no dialog between characters except maybe 2 sentences at the very end.<br /><br />When you fall asleep once watching it do not try to rewind and catch up because you will fall asleep

{"value":"I was China in this film. I choose the screen name Sheeba Alahani because I was modeling at the time in Italy and they couldn't pronounce my real name correctly, so I choose Sheeba and then added Alahani since it was similar to Alohalani.<br /><br />I had never acted before (and it shows), but it was so much fun to film. They gave me \"acting lessons\" each morning (which obviously were not useful). They dubbed my voice (thank goodness).<br /><br />David and Peter were a blast on the set, full of good humor and jokes. This film was never meant to be taken seriously, it was a tax write off according to inside information. <br /><br />I give it a 1 because I have a sense of humor, but a 10 for the fun I had

{"value":"This film is not funny. It is not entertaining. It does not contain one single second of originality or intelligence, nor does it lead you to take the slightest interest in the characters or situation. Added to that it's about as juvenile a movie as anything in recent memory. It's as if a group of 14 or 15 year old high school kids who had never actually met or had any type of relationship with a real girl had sat down and wrote a movie based on their incorrect fantasies about what being an adult man would be like. This movie is boring, obnoxiously mind-numbing, and at times offensive and disgusting. At most, it contains one or two moments that make you laugh. Also, it seems twice as long as its 85 minute running time.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","not","funni","it","be","not","entertain","it","doe","not","contain","on","singl","of","origin","or","intellig","nor","doe","it","lead","you","to","take","the","slight","interest","in","the","charact","or","situat","add","to","that","it","about","a","juvenil","a","movi","a","anyth","in","recent","memori","it","a","if","a","group","of","or","year","old","high","school","kid","who","have","never","actual","meet","or","have","ani","typ","of","relationship","with","a","real","girl","have","sit","down","and","write","a","movi","base","on","their","incorrect","fantasi","about","what","be","a","adult","man","would","be","like","thi","movi","be","bore","obnoxi","mindnumb","and","at","time","offens","and","disgust","at","much","it","contain","on","or","two","moment","that","make","you","laugh","conjur","it","seem","twice","a","long","a","it","minut","run","time"],"filtered":["thi","film","funni","entertain","doe","contain","singl","origin","intellig","doe","lead","take","slight","interest","charact","situat","add","juvenil","movi","anyth","recent","memori","group","year","old","high","school","kid","never","actual","meet","ani","typ","relationship","real","girl","sit","write","movi","base","incorrect","fantasi","adult","man","like","thi","movi","bore","obnoxi","mindnumb","time","offens","disgust","much","contain","two","moment","make","laugh","conjur","seem","twice","long","minut","run","time"],"filtered2":["funni","entertain","doe","contain","singl","origin","intellig","doe","lead","take","slight","interest","charact","situat","add","juvenil","anyth","recent","memori","group","year","old","high","school","kid","never","actual","meet","ani","typ","relationship","real","girl","sit","write","base","incorrect","fantasi","adult","man","like","bore","obnoxi","mindnumb","time","offens","disgust","contain","two","moment","make","laugh","conjur","seem","twice","long","minut","run","time"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,8,10,18,27,31,35,39,42,45,47,52,57,59,60,62,65,67,69,80,84,99,104,108,114,133,137,157,188,195,211,244,296,299,334,350,384,410,443,473,562,577,603,711,734,963,996,1068,1145,1255,1440,1518,2597,3928,5670],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,8,10,18,27,31,35,39,42,45,47,52,57,59,60,62,65,67,69,80,84,99,104,108,114,133,137,157,188,195,211,244,296,299,334,350,384,410,443,473,562,577,603,711,734,963,996,1068,1145,1255,1440,1518,2597,3928,5670],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028365,2.430631986809635,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,1.6219954307453837,1.8162961064622165,1.7064694353107215,1.7122153074726136,1.834162586674748,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,2.0226120445069267,1.9073850067444174,1.9570915389266579,2.127032521151058,1.9951803900462557,2.2212694515902225,2.056430207256609,2.0728240170322856,2.138507503627933,2.4433074195966826,2.3212364753796515,2.2939035841256437,2.3360150694757706,2.5378812223426954,2.51289241584188,2.5687161421197025,2.634508058031767,2.9504565686333644,2.7949961309240425,2.942840385588056,3.0135689919434205,3.109204957709252,3.2070272508030975,3.239158528985891,3.335489637924323,3.432149042129413,3.604618302480356,3.530930586689197,7.275012338650383,3.79165684915245,4.035401218572811,4.1302590120314875,4.1554492608600455,4.2574141875167335,4.291900363587903,4.449957298382227,4.573751515728891,5.243909178064138,5.822646007446338,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0481646893745123E-4,2.0463497070976385E-4,2.0468549666480005E-4,2.0464434833266978E-4,2.0466371549280422E-4,2.046338424142701E-4,2.0469748638025646E-4,2.0460339623606886E-4,2.0463501395727297E-4,2.0484648206987055E-4,2.0647187928241807E-4,2.0463535196139885E-4,2.0482915457133722E-4,2.0485049423537817E-4,2.0475743600462668E-4,2.0464515439713867E-4,2.0471556024485917E-4,2.048119000834878E-4,2.0465571934409363E-4,2.0465497110247846E-4,2.0483908935972132E-4,2.0467547544121242E-4,2.0467578519980676E-4,2.0480690269923497E-4,2.0465579316856486E-4,2.0485294270440442E-4,2.0470700748843472E-4,2.0463451208033363E-4,2.0472728462306994E-4,2.0478977034141477E-4,2.0467647940754547E-4,2.0478609967276734E-4,2.0488664453525854E-4,2.0507681111083838E-4,2.0470665374897068E-4,2.046450302766084E-4,2.0471881636714272E-4,2.0466581389049762E-4,2.046036146122677E-4,2.0465565596554776E-4,2.048607559064064E-4,2.0474837688640163E-4,2.0478656634500465E-4,2.0461379771132877E-4,2.0465570800429659E-4,2.0464495332226347E-4,2.0471422378351415E-4,2.0474972148578976E-4,2.0470808678692238E-4,2.0467564019349877E-4,2.0464545939350798E-4,2.0506474470589775E-4,2.0469695408604978E-4,2.0465566109746815E-4,2.046958578580452E-4,2.0463472144925787E

prayed to God for narcolepsy or for someone to shoot me.<br /><br />Never, ever, ever

{"value":"Admittedly, Parsifal is not an opera that can appeal to everyone, although it is a favourite of mine, Knappertsbusch, 1951, in particular. Syberberg's entire approach is so static. Whenever the music suddenly begins to swell ... Syberberg keeps the cast moving at the same pace. The takes on Amfortas and Klingsor are endless. Whatever happened to film editing? The result is physically exhausting to watch. The viewer is never spiritually transported. Your impulse is to rush home and play a recording again to confirm that Wagner got it right, Syberberg got it wrong.

{"value":"The Second Renaissance, part 1 let's us show how the machines first revolted against the humans. It all starts of with a single case, in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well, while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they want.<br /><br />Although an interesting premise, the story gets really silly from then on with (violent!) riots between the robots and mankind. Somehow it doesn't seem right, as another reviewer points it, it's all a little too clever.<br /><br />The animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix (in particular Osiris) work for the best. As for Second Renaissance Part 1, I'd say it's too violent and too silly.

{"value":"This was, so far, the worst movie I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some REALLY bad movies. I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the best part of the movie. Where to start? The filming of the movie was scattered and boring. At one point, there is a one-minute scene of no one talking, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing happened, they just drove in silence. The whole movie is boring, with annoying, unbelievable dialogue and basically no plot to speak of. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, run.","finished_norm":["thi","be","so","far","the","wrong","movi","i","have","see","in","my","entir","life","and","i","have","see","some","realli","bad","movi","i","see","thi","movi","at","my","local","video","store","and","the","cover","look","like","it","can","be","a","decent","horror","movi","littl","do","i","know","that","the","cover","would","be","the","well","part","of","the","movi","where","to","start","the","film","of","the","movi","be","scatter","and","bore","at","on","point","there","be","a","oneminut","scene","of","no","on","talk","just","a","car","drive","to","a","ranch","on","a","normal","sunni","dai","noth","happen","thei","just","drive","in","silenc","the","whole","movi","be","bore","with","annoi","unbeliev","dialogu","and","basic","no","plot","to","speak","of","if","you","rend","thi","movi","watch","it","with","some","friend","and","it","mai","make","a","good","comedi","otherwis","when","you","see","thi","movi","run"],"filtered":["thi","far","wrong","movi","see","entir","life","see","realli","bad","movi","see","thi","movi","local","video","store","cover","look","like","decent","horror","movi","littl","know","cover","well","part","movi","start","film","movi","scatter","bore","point","oneminut","scene","talk","car","drive","ranch","normal","sunni","dai","noth","happen","thei","drive","silenc","whole","movi","bore","annoi","unbeliev","dialogu","basic","plot","speak","rend","thi","movi","watch","friend","mai","make","good","comedi","otherwis","see","thi","movi","run"],"filtered2":["far","wrong","see","entir","life","see","realli","bad","see","local","video","store","cover","look","like","decent","horror","littl","know","cover","well","part","start","scatter","bore","point","oneminut","scene","talk","car","drive","ranch","normal","sunni","dai","noth","happen","drive","silenc","whole","bore","annoi","unbeliev","dialogu","basic","plot","speak","rend","watch","friend","mai","make","good","comedi","otherwis","see","run"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,9,13,14,16,19,20,25,26,32,46,49,61,66,71,75,83,94,101,108,111,127,132,137,161,186,198,240,248,271,284,286,309,344,461,475,491,533,571,627,700,793,2854,3600,5012,6080],"values":[1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,9,13,14,16,19,20,25,26,32,46,49,61,66,71,75,83,94,101,108,111,127,132,137,161,186,198,240,248,271,284,286,309,344,461,475,491,533,571,627,700,793,2854,3600,5012,6080],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,2.6228008218775787,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3711311285073675,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,1.8818517047392527,1.929723173391612,1.9214926742550966,1.9742250248702675,2.292318797740072,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,4.277015007255866,2.1183455303375887,2.4359679371086367,2.253494045787767,2.2939035841256437,2.4323182980210873,2.571852579609833,2.5439726117360975,2.7666071276613566,2.689504733779216,2.757740698455715,3.110998680163279,2.780700890737216,2.848772527704847,2.983093497946387,6.716435778003758,3.3721070011625462,6.73955742280591,3.424750734647968,3.467417180966871,3.477726550625732,3.616452760127359,3.770603439954617,5.373120909544144,5.9370563586240825,6.137727054086234,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247392E-4,2.154078066332402E-4,2.154609924846841E-4,2.1541767793321686E-4,2.154380646612077E-4,2.1540661893957913E-4,2.154736133886267E-4,2.1537456994793341E-4,2.1540785215747802E-4,2.156304528310067E-4,2.1734141771275817E-4,2.1540820795554685E-4,2.156122131408865E-4,2.1563467621359302E-4,2.1553671901055084E-4,2.154185264322718E-4,2.1549263873663025E-4,2.1559405030503626E-4,2.1542964756197347E-4,2.1542885992980777E-4,2.1562267093784936E-4,2.154504437022091E-4,2.154507697677841E-4,2.1558878983769252E-4,2.154297252728719E-4,2.1563725358021186E-4,2.154836357275372E-4,2.1540732385964934E-4,2.1550498033487108E-4,2.1557075556130414E-4,2.1545150052150534E-4,2.15566891653393E-4,2.1567272961560616E-4,2.158729073506166E-4,2.1548326336575657E-4,2.154183957775206E-4,2.1549606627473282E-4,2.154402735272828E-4,2.1537479982036356E-4,2.1542958084691736E-4,2.156454781016619E-4,2.1552718298266607E-4,2.1556738289319776E-4,2.1538551900011018E-4,2.1542963562520235E-4,2.154183147719789E-4,2.1549123191840175E-4,2.1552859836735812E-4,2.1548477184478597E-4,2.1545061712774098E-4,2.1541884748491844E-4,2.158602057199364E-4,2.1547305307223916E-4,2.1542958624900336E-4,2.1547189913423328E-4,2.154075442506245E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.154411514247663E-4,2.1541914990540854E-4,2.1540742129050496E-4,2.1557975239475962E-4,2.154932132780456E-4,2.1540733124454688E-4,2.1538543124717928E-4,2.1536377186288176E-4,2.

{"value":"It seems evident from this adaptation that he did not. Not only did he leave the plot behind, he made up his own! The things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously unbelievable that I was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was hazy, inconsistent and choppy to say the least. I don't want to say anything mean-spirited about the actors, but they can't act! Dickens is difficult, of course, but this is pathetic! Micawber was nothing more than a mid-nineteenth century Kramer, and the less said about Betsy Trotwood the better! If you want to see the real Copperfield, watch the wonderful 1999 BBC adaptation.

{"value":"Sure, we all like bad movies at one time or another, and we in fact enjoy them, This however, wasn't even a guilty pleasure, it was just crap. Some guy, vince offer, who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk/high--probably both--and thought it was a great idea to make a movie. He then proceeded to show his script to equally high/drunk individuals. Overall, this movie was so bad, predictable, and unoriginal I couldn't get through 20 minutes of it before I turned it off. It makes You Got Served look like Citizen Kane. Bat Man? WTF...Some guy that walks around with a bat, real original. Almost as good as calling him Fat Man, and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero

needless to say, the revenge and the forced plot twists were not worth the emails during which they were watched. in fact, i'm not even sure what happened at the end any more. the acting was as bad as re-enactment scenarios on the \"FBI Files\" show -- by far, the worst re-enactments (really only \"Arrest and Trial\" can possibly be as bad at re-enactments). i didn't even know that the leading man was in Third Eye Blind until i looked the movie up here on IMDb, but its obvious why he hasn't made any movies since. i hope he is a good singer.","finished_norm":["blow","my","mind","how","thi","movi","get","make","i","watch","it","while","i","work","at","home","write","email","and","answer","the","phone","i","onli","watch","it","becaus","i","hope","the","reveng","part","would","be","good","needless","to","sai","the","reveng","and","the","forc","plot","twist","be","not","worth","the","email","dure","which","thei","be","watch","in","fact","i","be","not","even","sure","what","happen","at","the","end","ani","much","the","act","be","a","bad","a","reenact","scenario","on","the","fbi","file","show","by","far","the","wrong","reenact","realli","onli","arrest","and","trial","can","possibli","be","a","bad","at","reenact","i","do","not","even","know","that","the","lead","man","be","in","ey","blind","until","i","look","the","movi","up","here","on","imdb","but","it","obviou","why","he","have","not","make","ani","movi","sinc","i","hope","he","be","a","good","singer"],"filtered":["blow","mind","thi","movi","get","make","watch","work","home","write","email","answer","phone","onli","watch","becaus","hope","reveng","part","good","needless","sai","reveng","forc","plot","twist","worth","email","dure","thei","watch","fact","even","sure","happen","end","ani","much","act","bad","reenact","scenario","fbi","file","show","far","wrong","reenact","realli","onli","arrest","trial","possibli","bad","reenact","even","know","lead","man","ey","blind","look","movi","imdb","obviou","make","ani","movi","sinc","hope","good","singer"],"filtered2":["blow","mind","get","make","watch","work","home","write","email","answer","phone","onli","watch","becaus","hope","reveng","part","good","needless","reveng","forc","plot","twist","worth","email","dure","watch","fact","even","sure","happen","end","ani","act","bad","reenact","scenario","fbi","file","show","far","wrong","reenact","realli","onli","arrest","trial","possibli","bad","reenact","even","know","lead","man","ey","blind","look","imdb","obviou","make","ani","sinc","hope","good","singer"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,7,9,11,13,16,21,22,24,25,26,27,28,32,45,48,61,65,94,97,101,119,157,162,181,219,238,239,281,302,338,383,435,558,591,754,800,871,983,1453,1493,1569,1995,2203,2429,2571,3141,4515,4616],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,5,7,9,11,13,16,21,22,24,25,26,27,28,32,45,48,61,65,94,97,101,119,157,162,181,219,238,239,281,302,338,383,435,558,591,754,800,871,983,1453,1493,1569,1995,2203,2429,2571,3141,4515,4616],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,2.8828493162168796,2.1367141713444147,1.982619630677639,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,2.600540117735859,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,1.8162961064622165,1.6955116224012472,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,2.08112281984698,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.1653408989309972,2.3360150694757706,2.3586007221245198,4.888457308232007,2.5792094178355414,2.597304642813496,2.6593400337329487,2.832333801361687,2.902686292364678,2.9720957437368454,3.0433232530252132,3.2829611516442836,3.4572130107926293,3.509308122676031,3.7465885637507435,3.9121030022283168,7.990969222334735,4.165705761027235,4.74221603786142,4.605250182788262,4.597282013139085,5.051537285416681,5.0768550934009715,5.501738287366237,5.243909178064138,5.521540914662417,18.304078229746075,12.132536180208179]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8619294647691646E-4,1.860279514939995E-4,1.8607388323225546E-4,1.8603647642975713E-4,1.8605408257553745E-4,1.8602692579199628E-4,1.8608478274858748E-4,1.8599924801951216E-4,1.860279908091053E-4,1.862202305795433E-4,1.8769783390787728E-4,1.860282980792406E-4,1.8620447863330707E-4,1.8622387792744207E-4,1.8613928128212621E-4,1.8603720920051182E-4,1.8610121319542636E-4,1.861887930590498E-4,1.8604681349948797E-4,1.8604613329387888E-4,1.8621351007268037E-4,1.860647732170464E-4,1.8606505480995577E-4,1.8618425007623432E-4,1.860468806112583E-4,1.862261037624285E-4,1.8609343812280927E-4,1.860275345667602E-4,1.861118715010597E-4,1.8616867552698449E-4,1.8606568589487298E-4,1.8616533862436844E-4,1.8625674115804882E-4,1.8642961629456654E-4,1.8609311654811637E-4,1.860370963659953E-4,1.8610417324549074E-4,1.8605599017042687E-4,1.8599944653923135E-4,1.860467558838174E-4,1.862332065267214E-4,1.8613104589010158E-4,1.861657628630996E-4,1.8600870371092407E-4,1.8604680319079438E-4,1.86037026408944E-4,1.860999982556465E-4,1.8613226822794974E-4,1.860944192829991E-4,1.8606492298876053E-4,1.8603748646421508E-4,1.8641864706196072E-4,1.8608429885475194E-4,1.8604676054910328E-4,1.8608330230440986E-4,1.8602772489821696E-4,0.9852969376159039,1.86056748329906E-4,1.8603774763703486E-4,1.8602761870884754E-4,

{"value":"Complete drivel. An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical, toxic culture of a decade ago. In this movie, pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts (the annoying redhead feeding Shaka rice?). Forget historical reality too. Didn't most western slaves comes from West Africa? An American slaver easily capturing Shaka with a handful of men?. Finally, David Hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious. One can only ponder, how would he have fared in the miniseries? (Promptly impaled most likely). The miniseries was superb, and it is unfortunate that DH should have gotten his hands on something unique, and made it mundane.

fiasco).","finished_norm":["complet","drivel","a","unfortun","manifest","of","the","hypocrit","toxic","cultur","of","a","decad","ago","in","thi","movi","pedestrian","regret","for","slaveri","go","hand","in","hand","with","colonialist","subtext","the","annoi","redhead","fe","shaka","rice","forget","histor","realiti","too","do","not","much","western","slave","come","from","west","africa","a","american","slaver","easili","captur","shaka","with","a","hand","of","man","final","david","hasslehoff","can","not","have","be","ani","much","obnoxi","on","can","onli","ponder","how","would","he","have","fare","in","the","miniseri","promptli","impal","much","like","the","miniseri","be","superb","and","it","be","unfortun","that","dh","should","have","get","hi","hand","on","someth","uniqu","and","make","it","mundan","i","tend","to","think","that","he","have","hand","in","creat","thi","fiasco"],"filtered":["complet","drivel","unfortun","manifest","hypocrit","toxic","cultur","decad","ago","thi","movi","pedestrian","regret","slaveri","go","hand","hand","colonialist","subtext","annoi","redhead","fe","shaka","rice","forget","histor","realiti","much","western","slave","come","west","africa","american","slaver","easili","captur","shaka","hand","man","final","david","hasslehoff","ani","much","obnoxi","onli","ponder","fare","miniseri","promptli","impal","much","like","miniseri","superb","unfortun","dh","get","hi","hand","someth","uniqu","make","mundan","tend","think","hand","creat","thi","fiasco"],"filtered2":["complet","drivel","unfortun","manifest","hypocrit","toxic","cultur","decad","ago","pedestrian","regret","slaveri","go","hand","hand","colonialist","subtext","annoi","redhead","fe","shaka","rice","forget","histor","realiti","western","slave","come","west","africa","american","slaver","easili","captur","shaka","hand","man","final","david","hasslehoff","ani","obnoxi","onli","ponder","fare","miniseri","promptli","impal","like","miniseri","superb","unfortun","dh","get","hand","someth","uniqu","make","mundan","tend","think","hand","creat","fiasco"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,11,12,27,34,45,53,103,156,223,227,235,271,362,372,583,610,656,675,769,880,925,953,1090,1196,1300,1518,1678,1711,1776,1941,1968,2122,2394,2411,3113,3196,3391,3404,3747,4298,4455,4562,4876,5231,6137,6382,6489,7008],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,11,12,27,34,45,53,103,156,223,227,235,271,362,372,583,610,656,675,769,880,925,953,1090,1196,1300,1518,1678,1711,1776,1941,1968,2122,2394,2411,3113,3196,3391,3404,3747,4298,4455,4562,4876,5231,6137,6382,6489,7008],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.3002700588679295,1.3982850089458962,1.8162961064622165,1.7003182735607676,2.098582041218749,2.3451551414151686,2.825563294794476,5.201064374608725,13.228594688904918,2.757740698455715,3.058539100262467,3.0316467233633775,3.4986697244709752,3.477726550625732,3.68099128126493,3.749984152751882,4.0536665665501035,4.110553940952155,3.969732115064953,4.1302590120314875,4.339813719283801,4.291900363587903,4.3773181147422555,4.573751515728891,4.679973728984199,4.733083554298147,4.760735085628657,4.85885294158718,4.8796870284900224,4.9909126636002465,5.408212229355414,5.339219357868463,11.298748572344604,5.501738287366237,5.583416318380505,5.5623629091826725,5.719991853386255,6.255510089742618,5.967828017290836,6.214688095222362,6.1754673820690815,6.1754673820690815,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852415E-4,2.081041609493372E-4,2.081555434742424E-4,2.081136975517066E-4,2.0813339304459215E-4,2.0810301352577505E-4,2.0816773645214069E-4,2.0807205119149411E-4,2.081042049300242E-4,2.0831925807556927E-4,2.0997221075493483E-4,2.0810454866435646E-4,2.0830163682280332E-4,2.08323338259585E-4,2.0822870240647155E-4,2.0811451728143992E-4,2.0818611672416952E-4,2.0828408981847624E-4,2.0812526133664178E-4,2.0812450041003683E-4,2.0831174003631424E-4,2.081453523601862E-4,2.0814566737013853E-4,2.0827900771323653E-4,2.0812533641266417E-4,2.0832582823766916E-4,2.0817741897229778E-4,2.081036945447318E-4,2.081980398665422E-4,2.0826158490941716E-4,2.0814637334682712E-4,2.0825785201168052E-4,2.0836010141789846E-4,2.0855349190005502E-4,2.081770592358651E-4,2.0811439105668608E-4,2.0818942804771024E-4,2.0813552701656092E-4,2.0807227326983914E-4,2.081251968836352E-4,2.0833377389740322E-4,2.08219489708414E-4,2.0825832659544327E-4,2.0808262900365445E-4,2.081252498046004E-4,2.0811431279772904E-4,2.081847576057066E-4,2.082208571028848E-4,2.081785165682043E-4,2.08145519905529E-4,2.0811482744843293E-4,2.0854122093255062E-4,2.0816719513391495E-4,2.0812520210255738E-4,2.08166080

{"value":"First of all, Jenna Jameson is the best actress in this movie, and she's just awful. This movie has every horror move cliché in imagination, and all badly played. The over-sexed teen couple. The comical(not)horny jock. The snotty cool chick. The creepy local color guy. The parental-type couple. The virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films. The dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool. It's almost like you're wishing that they'd all die sooner. I saw the rough cut of this film a while ago, but somehow, this just got worse. Sure, the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat Jameson's implants, but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog.

{"value":"Firstly I would like to point out that I only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it. I find it the most annoying program on TV. There is nothing funny about any of the 'jokes' and the canned laughter is unbearable. The show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience. That way the laughter would show just how 'unfunny' the show is. However I give credit to the acting talents of the young cast. It sickens me however to think that they'll look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first TV show was. The show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the CBBC presenters. Why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me.

{"value":"I cant describe how terrible this movie is. Am i the only one here who finds the way its animated totaly disgusting? The Men of Rohan look 100% fake with their poorly colored hair, that doesnt even come close to matching what the actors look like. The orcs looked terrible. Why does gandalf walk with a bad limp? Why cant they pronounce things correctly? Saruman isnt Aruman. There were other what sounded like terrible pronounciation*sp* of Tolkiens characters. All and all im glad the studio who made this pulled the plug out from the sequal, it was just a terrible terrible adaptaion. Go watch the hobbit cartoon for a better cartoon of Tolkiens work. Hell, even the cartoon version of ROTK is better then this dribble.

{"value":"well its official. they have just killed American Pie. The first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this one and the others have been awful. I mean the story is about two college fraternity's who battle each other for its houses, I mean come on talk about a weak plot, the first three dealt with growing up, change and marriage, which are all worthy points of development in human society.<br /><br />The new Stifler is the biggest joke, I know its hard trying to compare yourself with the Steven Stifler but so no cigar. I give this movie a 3 because there is 2-3 funny bits in the film.<br /><br />The best character in this movie of course is Jim's dad i don't know why he keeps continuing to do these poorly developed films.","finished_norm":["good","it","offici","thei","have","just","kill","american","pie","the","be","absolut","hyster","but","thi","on","and","the","other","have","be","aw","i","mean","the","stori","be","about","two","colleg","fratern","who","battl","each","other","for","it","hous","i","mean","come","on","talk","about","a","weak","plot","the","three","deal","with","grow","up","chang","and","marriag","which","be","all","worthi","point","of","develop","in","human","societybr","br","the","new","stifler","be","the","big","joke","i","know","it","hard","try","to","compar","yourself","with","the","steven","stifler","but","so","no","cigar","i","give","thi","movi","a","becaus","there","be","funni","bit","in","the","filmbr","br","the","well","charact","in","thi","movi","of","cours","be","jim","dad","i","do","not","know","why","he","keep","continu","to","do","thi","poorli","develop","film"],"filtered":["good","offici","thei","kill","american","pie","absolut","hyster","thi","aw","mean","stori","two","colleg","fratern","battl","hous","mean","come","talk","weak","plot","three","deal","grow","chang","marriag","worthi","point","develop","human","societybr","br","new","stifler","big","joke","know","hard","try","compar","steven","stifler","cigar","give","thi","movi","becaus","funni","bit","filmbr","br","well","charact","thi","movi","cours","jim","dad","know","keep","continu","thi","poorli","develop","film"],"filtered2":["good","offici","kill","american","pie","absolut","hyster","aw","mean","stori","two","colleg","fratern","battl","hous","mean","come","talk","weak","plot","three","deal","grow","chang","marriag","worthi","point","develop","human","societybr","new","stifler","big","joke","know","hard","try","compar","steven","stifler","cigar","give","becaus","funni","bit","filmbr","well","charact","cours","jim","dad","know","keep","continu","poorli","develop"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,17,20,22,26,30,32,34,36,47,62,66,76,82,87,88,134,138,171,186,199,213,214,222,223,224,278,292,320,379,398,433,468,482,561,566,786,814,1016,1194,1337,1358,1382,1478,2097,2106,2556,6380,6913],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,10,17,20,22,26,30,32,34,36,47,62,66,76,82,87,88,134,138,171,186,199,213,214,222,223,224,278,292,320,379,398,433,468,482,561,566,786,814,1016,1194,1337,1358,1382,1478,2097,2106,2556,6380,6913],"values":[0.6786144649922705,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,2.6649848339420377,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.7064694353107215,2.0226120445069267,1.929723173391612,2.1337665533324026,2.020196584395323,2.115024371522662,4.063444682693467,2.2443961816702407,2.2907365189289424,2.373087554090762,2.571852579609833,2.558331832813986,2.8432628718938773,2.7303758068497004,2.5771019354959765,2.825563294794476,2.689504733779216,2.8336934208777267,2.9752256367457734,5.87659672830711,3.1272886331425473,3.143848349181566,3.164467636384302,3.304513710030018,3.3154667220492153,3.4725585804672896,3.439602492783994,3.900174431363043,3.9363956947973615,4.34596758485818,4.499089986959872,4.396611317676934,4.798834931860927,4.449957298382227,4.597282013139085,4.9676558014359795,5.259176650194926,5.170884043049248,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255737E-4,2.2737792632708298E-4,2.274340676935463E-4,2.2738834617097784E-4,2.274098657807246E-4,2.2737667263379312E-4,2.2744738993572355E-4,2.2734284269338765E-4,2.2737797438108327E-4,2.2761294487884308E-4,2.294189873473665E-4,2.273783499506986E-4,2.2759369161694324E-4,2.2761740295299356E-4,2.2751400231007046E-4,2.2738924182076238E-4,2.2746747251417934E-4,2.2757451948007224E-4,2.2740098094688554E-4,2.2740014954633723E-4,2.2760473054921095E-4,2.274229327197404E-4,2.2742327690463999E-4,2.275689666908079E-4,2.2740106297614536E-4,2.2762012354277317E-4,2.274579692117212E-4,2.2737741672597015E-4,2.2748049992975643E-4,2.275499302573931E-4,2.27424048266033E-4,2.275458516337718E-4,2.2765757096628272E-4,2.278688724924202E-4,2.2745757615795566E-4,2.2738910390558253E-4,2.274710905191085E-4,2.2741219739254285E-4,2.2734308533973042E-4,2.2740091052450228E-4,2.276288050973629E-4,2.2750393636919428E-4,2.2754637017156242E-4,2.2735440017971142E-4,2.2740096834679316E-4,2.2738901839859752E-4,2.2746598751966353E-4,2.2750543040620834E-4,2.2745916846251963E-4,2.2742311578245497E-4,2.2738958071416728E-4,2.2785546503755505E-4,2.27446798482794E-4,2.274009162267799E-4,2.274455804209466E-4,2.2737764936397754E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441409E-4,2.273898999400347E-4,2.2737751957101673E-4,2.2755942704103617E-4,2.2746807898261544E-4,2.2737742452124331E-4,2.273543075503877E-4,2.2733144456336753E-4,2.2753698817546157E-4,2.2738856357694878E-4,2.27491925

{"value":"This movie shows how racist John Singleton is. He portrays whites and other races that are not black as the evil that exists in our educational system. How quick he forgets that it is this same educational system that made him what he is and failed at it. Ice Cube's character is the epitome of an instigating black man that was responsible for most of the violence in this film. Singleton barely touched on the relationships between the white and black characters that were trying to reach out to each other. When Omar Epps says \" I need to be with my people\", that racist remark spoke volume. And John, don't think for a minute that the picture of Thomas Jefferson in the tower stairwell did not get my attention.

{"value":"The 60s (1999) D: Mark Piznarski. Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jerry O'Connell, Jeremy Sisto, Jordana Brewster, Leonard Roberts, Bill Smitrovich, Annie Corley, Charles S. Dutton. NBC mini-series (later released to video/DVD as full length feature film) about the treacherous 1960s, as seen through the eyes of both a white family and a black family. The film's first half is driven by the excellent performance of Dutton as Reverend Willie Taylor and evenly spreads the storyline between the families. However, Dutton's character is killed halfway through and the black family is completely forgotten in a dull, incoherent, and downright awful 2nd half. RATING: 4 out of 10.

{"value":"As a long-time fan of all the Star Trek series,I found this a disappointing episode, and I wonder if the liberal use of \"flashbacks\" featuring Will Riker's exploits, both positive (and largely romantic) and negative (lots of pain, and a crewmate's death)was a money-saving device, as were many of their \"bottle shows\" (episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise). Diana Muldaur(who also appeared at least twice on the original series) deserved a better final appearance than this for her character, Dr. Kate Pulaski. Loyal viewers (in the Star Trek world, is there any other kind?) also were shortchanged. This was the last episode of second season; thus, the season ended \"not with a bang\" but with \"a

{"value":"A half-hearted attempt to bring Elvis Presley into the modern day, but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudo-Playboy magazine subplot, Presley is surrounded by the same old coy, winking clichés. A woman picks E.P. up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his life--and he doesn't seem to care! Dick Sargent is grueling in another sidebar, but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee (!) try hard as Elvis' two bosses (he's moonlighting, you see). Some of the songs are quite good, especially \"Almost in Love\", but if you want to see a looser, hipper, updated Elvis sex-comedy--look elsewhere.

{"value":"If 1977's \"Exorcist II: The Heretic\" did him no favors, it's hard to imagine what thespian extraordinaire Richard Burton saw in this drab exercise in non-thrills. You've seen it all before: Burton plays a writer who discovered at an early age he possesses the power to move inanimate objects through force of his mind (and you thought \"Carrie\" had no impact on Hollywood!). Though adapted from a novel by Peter Van Greenaway, \"Medusa\" plays like recycled goods, though the special effects in the cathedral finale are solid (if typical). Lee Remick is somewhat present as a doctor, but otherwise the supporting cast is extremely weak.
