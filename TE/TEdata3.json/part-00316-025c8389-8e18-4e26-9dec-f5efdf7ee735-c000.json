{"value":"An art house maven's dream. Overrated, overpraised, overdone; a pretentious melange that not only did not deserve Best Picture of 1951 on its own merits, it was dwarfed by the competition from the start. Place in the Sun, Detective Story, Streetcar Named Desire, Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man; you name it, if it came out in '51, it's better than this arthouse crapola. The closing ballet is claptrap for the intellectual crowd, out of place and in the wrong movie. Few actors in their time were less capable (at acting) or less charismatic than Kelly and Caron. My #12 Worst of '51 (I saw 201 movies), and among the 5 worst Best Picture Oscar winners.","finished_norm":["a","art","hous","maven","dream","overr","overprais","overdo","a","pretenti","melang","that","not","onli","do","not","deserv","well","pictur","of","on","it","own","merit","it","be","dwarf","by","the","competit","from","the","start","place","in","the","sun","detect","stori","streetcar","name","desir","abbott","and","costello","meet","the","invis","man","you","name","it","if","it","come","out","in","it","well","than","thi","arthous","crapola","the","close","ballet","be","claptrap","for","the","intellectu","crowd","out","of","place","and","in","the","wrong","movi","few","actor","in","their","time","be","littl","capabl","at","act","or","littl","charismat","than","kelli","and","caron","my","wrong","of","i","see","movi","and","among","the","wrong","well","pictur","oscar","winner"],"filtered":["art","hous","maven","dream","overr","overprais","overdo","pretenti","melang","onli","deserv","well","pictur","merit","dwarf","competit","start","place","sun","detect","stori","streetcar","name","desir","abbott","costello","meet","invis","man","name","come","well","thi","arthous","crapola","close","ballet","claptrap","intellectu","crowd","place","wrong","movi","actor","time","littl","capabl","act","littl","charismat","kelli","caron","wrong","see","movi","among","wrong","well","pictur","oscar","winner"],"filtered2":["art","hous","maven","dream","overr","overprais","overdo","pretenti","melang","onli","deserv","well","pictur","merit","dwarf","competit","start","place","sun","detect","stori","streetcar","name","desir","abbott","costello","meet","invis","man","name","come","well","arthous","crapola","close","ballet","claptrap","intellectu","crowd","place","wrong","actor","time","littl","capabl","act","littl","charismat","kelli","caron","wrong","see","among","wrong","well","pictur","oscar","winner"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,11,14,17,20,21,25,34,41,45,71,143,164,213,295,311,350,382,423,607,826,979,1047,1062,1182,1536,1695,1704,1720,1782,1977,2112,2155,2254,2339,2668,3465,3851,4368,4521,6986,7983,8256],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,11,14,17,20,21,25,34,41,45,71,143,164,213,295,311,350,382,423,607,826,979,1047,1062,1182,1536,1695,1704,1720,1782,1977,2112,2155,2254,2339,2668,3465,3851,4368,4521,6986,7983,8256],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,2.2350163994518417,1.2770536940105968,3.4960351200691706,1.162015545335049,3.838916364248105,1.3982850089458962,1.5687599167621034,1.8162961064622165,1.9214926742550966,4.681980408231769,4.7860550597492155,2.8432628718938773,2.7910771187233068,5.8406676183565125,3.0135689919434205,3.235085203598255,3.164467636384302,3.68099128126493,3.8204358137024927,4.096025840389245,4.140259095366071,4.327618446189983,4.327618446189983,4.5432147918688095,4.715065048795469,4.869215728622727,4.724033718778229,5.3064295350454715,4.900964426937307,4.9909126636002465,5.426230734858092,5.274680836730892,5.170884043049248,5.274680836730892,5.649374286172302,5.850044981634453,6.0662680901040895,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651682E-4,2.3166917872259946E-4,2.3172637963242838E-4,2.316797952178615E-4,2.3170172096235656E-4,2.316679013686385E-4,2.3173995330228193E-4,2.3163343296338663E-4,2.3166922768351207E-4,2.3190863272655812E-4,2.33748760227849E-4,2.3166961034116817E-4,2.318890161021825E-4,2.3191317493693802E-4,2.3180782283696802E-4,2.316807077710427E-4,2.317604148947181E-4,2.3186948213389013E-4,2.316926684470494E-4,2.316918213556658E-4,2.3190026336973281E-4,2.3171503451076958E-4,2.3171538519139325E-4,2.3186382454808455E-4,2.3169275202442898E-4,2.3191594687179586E-4,2.317507322385729E-4,2.316686595038996E-4,2.3177368817377546E-4,2.3184442884434912E-4,2.3171617111051614E-4,2.3184027324578277E-4,2.3195410103209573E-4,2.3216939040434853E-4,2.3175033176679218E-4,2.316805672530207E-4,2.3176410118143945E-4,2.3170409657815954E-4,2.316336801891392E-4,2.3169259669560035E-4,2.3192479227141018E-4,2.3179756692385666E-4,2.3184080156982031E-4,2.316452085715469E-4,2.316926556091583E-4,2.3168048013228165E-4,2.3175890187423522E-4,2.3179908915749482E-4,2.3175195412256157E-4,2.3171522102838552E-4,2.3168105306030652E-4,2.321557299136072E-4,2.3173935068699443E-4,2.316926025054958E-4,2.3173810963694012E-4,2.316688965324317E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908902E-4,2.3168137831085182E-4,2.316687642899176E-4,2.318541048586511E-4,2.317610328088964E-4,2.316686674462912E-4,2.3164511419405083E-4,2.3162181971902562E-4,2.3183124250942E-4,2.3168001672688635E-4,2.3178532984537454E-4,2.318533529636741E-4,2.3174816560918483E-4,2.3169290937467257E-4,2.316454178653595E-4,2.3170467704319514E-4,2.3164529309826844E-4,2.3165744946862285E-4,2.3164542442150217E-4,2.31795794672

{"value":"Oh my god, what a horrible film. The film has all the right people involved, unfortunately it is not worth watching. I saw it for free at my local library. If I had paid to watch this I would be even more upset. This film is unwatchable. How could Tarintino be involved with such a slow paced, unexciting film. No wonder it didn't get much distribution, every one involved must have been ashamed. I can make a better film with a Dated Camcorder and my Big toe. Its beyond boring, I really hated it. Tarintino just lost some standing in my eyes. This must be some kind of sick joke. Don't Bother with this film.

{"value":"This has been put out on the DVD market by Alpha, and it's for die-hard Boris Karloff fans (like moi) only. It's not a horror flick, but a drama where Boris is a struggling scientist agreeing to kill a wealthy woman's husband in order to gain the fortune needed to continue with his work. But once the dying victim changes his will and leaves his spouse nothing, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />It's appeasing enough seeing Karloff as another selfish sinister type, and some of the acting is unintentionally hilarious (especially from the leading lady Mona Goya who is absolutely a laugh riot as the double-crossed wife).<br /><br />But proceed with much

{"value":"Dysfunctional family goes home for the holidays and murder and mayhem result. Violent sexy Milligan at his most home made. Little better than a home movie (as much of Milligans films are) this is a trip into depravity 1960's style. Notable for the copious nudity and sex this film is neither sexy nor gruesome, playing now more as quaint.(though decidedly r rated). The film suffers from its uneven cast and from the cheapness of the production.(No one was ever sure where the money went on his movies since he was always broke). Its a bad bad movie thats not worth seeing except as a Milligan completeist or because its got some good looking people fooling around.","finished_norm":["dysfunct","famili","go","home","for","the","holidai","and","murder","and","mayhem","result","violent","sexi","milligan","at","hi","much","home","make","littl","well","than","a","home","movi","a","much","of","milligan","film","be","thi","be","a","trip","into","deprav","styl","notabl","for","the","copiou","nuditi","and","sex","thi","film","be","neither","sexi","nor","gruesom","plai","now","much","a","quaintthough","decidedli","r","rate","the","film","suffer","from","it","uneven","cast","and","from","the","cheap","of","the","productionno","on","be","ever","sure","where","the","monei","go","on","hi","movi","sinc","he","be","alwai","break","it","a","bad","bad","movi","that","not","worth","see","except","a","a","milligan","completeist","or","becaus","it","get","some","good","look","peopl","fool","around"],"filtered":["dysfunct","famili","go","home","holidai","murder","mayhem","result","violent","sexi","milligan","hi","much","home","make","littl","well","home","movi","much","milligan","film","thi","trip","deprav","styl","notabl","copiou","nuditi","sex","thi","film","neither","sexi","gruesom","plai","much","quaintthough","decidedli","r","rate","film","suffer","uneven","cast","cheap","productionno","ever","sure","monei","go","hi","movi","sinc","alwai","break","bad","bad","movi","worth","see","except","milligan","completeist","becaus","get","good","look","peopl","fool","around"],"filtered2":["dysfunct","famili","go","home","holidai","murder","mayhem","result","violent","sexi","milligan","home","make","littl","well","home","milligan","trip","deprav","styl","notabl","copiou","nuditi","sex","neither","sexi","gruesom","plai","quaintthough","decidedli","r","rate","suffer","uneven","cast","cheap","productionno","ever","sure","monei","go","sinc","alwai","break","bad","bad","worth","see","except","milligan","completeist","becaus","get","good","look","peopl","fool","around"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,9,14,16,20,22,23,40,44,92,98,119,126,162,182,197,202,219,232,254,273,302,351,360,380,447,612,633,718,966,1042,1057,1087,1602,1722,2031,2103,2973,3554,4303,4694,4907,6662],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,6,9,14,16,20,22,23,40,44,92,98,119,126,162,182,197,202,219,232,254,273,302,351,360,380,447,612,633,718,966,1042,1057,1087,1602,1722,2031,2103,2973,3554,4303,4694,4907,6662],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,2.1367141713444147,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,2.0489535369135887,2.0881990796736947,2.1653408989309972,2.2391270689902285,2.3586007221245198,2.7365296724240786,2.558331832813986,2.597304642813496,2.5792094178355414,2.6102777977348763,2.889652074525771,2.9674191958529437,8.708058877094034,3.0135689919434205,3.028335462059722,3.102062070196872,3.2070272508030975,3.5929222627171646,3.550241531602284,3.634471265630037,4.026392148630444,4.115443926246347,4.181290492043933,8.352137096125563,4.724033718778229,4.724033718778229,5.156897801074508,4.9676558014359795,5.373120909544144,5.672363804397,5.9370563586240825,6.137727054086234,6.101359409915359,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651695E-4,2.316691787225996E-4,2.317263796324285E-4,2.316797952178616E-4,2.3170172096235667E-4,2.316679013686386E-4,2.3173995330228204E-4,2.3163343296338674E-4,2.316692276835122E-4,2.3190863272655826E-4,2.337487603444618E-4,2.316696103411683E-4,2.3188901610218262E-4,2.3191317493693816E-4,2.3180782283696816E-4,2.3168070777104281E-4,2.3176041489471824E-4,2.3186948213389024E-4,2.3169266844704953E-4,2.316918213556659E-4,2.3190026336973295E-4,2.3171503451076972E-4,2.317153851913934E-4,2.3186382454808466E-4,2.316927520244291E-4,2.3191594687179597E-4,2.3175073223857302E-4,2.316686595038997E-4,2.3177368817377557E-4,2.3184442884434926E-4,2.3171617111051625E-4,2.3184027324578288E-4,2.3195410103209587E-4,2.3216939040434864E-4,2.317503317667923E-4,2.3168056725302085E-4,2.3176410118143958E-4,2.3170409657815967E-4,2.316336801891393E-4,2.3169259669560049E-4,2.319247922714103E-4,2.3179756692385677E-4,2.3184080156982045E-4,2.3164520857154702E-4,2.3169265560915844E-4,2.3168048013228178E-4,2.3175890187423535E-4,2.3179908915749495E-4,2.3175195412256168E-4,2.3171522102838563E-4,2.3168105306030666E-4,2.3215572991360734E-4,2.3173935068699456E-4,2.316926025054959E-4,2.3173810963694026E-4,2.3166889653243185E-4,0.9816895990097366,2.3170504074908913E-4,2.3168137831085196E-4,2.316687642899177E-4,2.3185410485865123E-4,2.3176103280889653E-4,2.3166866744629133E-4,2.3164511419405094E-4,2.3162181971902575E-4,2.3183124250942012E-4,2.3168001672688648E-4,2.3178532984537465E-4,2.318533529636742E-4,2.317481656091

{"value":"I remember this movie when i was 13 (seems a lot of reviews are saying the same thing AGE 13!) with a group of school buddies. We all wanted to see Billy Crystal in his first movie, and fell for the typical commercial ads telling us this was a great comedy. We suffered through about 45 minutes of it, and all agreed to leave the theater. It was grotesque & tasteless, and a far cry from the ability Billy Crystal had to make us laugh, we were not laughing. I stumbled upon this review by accident, and decided to register just to tell the rest of the world what a rot-gut waste of film this was, now if you rent this, you deserve what you get, YOU'VE BEEN

{"value":"This movie was amusing at times, hell sometimes it was even downright funny.<br /><br />The underlying message I got from the film though, was that women are responsible for all of the troubles of man. Every time a woman is depicted in the film, she is being lazy, being slutty or lambasting some poor guy for no apparent reason. I don't think the message involved is good for women or gay men.<br /><br />But, it is a comedy, and a piece of art, so it is simply someones point of view.

{"value":"My boyfriend and I rented this because we thought it might be a good 'Halloween' take-off. A killer terrorizing young people, a white mask...you get my drift. We were dead wrong! No pun intended. We not only discovered one of the worst movies out there, but also that it is a cult classic! It is filled w/plot holes and makes no sense. The actress who plays Maddy is pretty, but that's about it. I do give credit for it being shot on a VERY low budget--I always support movies like that. Just not this particular one.<br /><br />This movie may be good to see if you're drunk or high; otherwise don't bother.

{"value":"I couldn't believe my eyes once I've watched this movie. There's no point in it either then blood and violence. Unlike other scary movies that had gore and a meaning to it this movie is just blood, gore, and killing one after another. This movie isn't interesting at all, has no meaningful plot or story line, nor does it have an intelligence in it. The blood looks very fake and this movie overall, is pointless. Don't even waste your time with it. It's just an hour or two of mindless violence. It has many bloody scenes that aren't scary but just plain revolting. This is probably the worst horror film I have ever watched out of all the horror films I ever saw.","finished_norm":["i","can","not","believ","my","ey","onc","i","have","watch","thi","movi","there","no","point","in","it","either","then","blood","and","violenc","unlik","other","scari","movi","that","have","gore","and","a","mean","to","it","thi","movi","be","just","blood","gore","and","kill","on","after","anoth","thi","movi","be","not","interest","at","all","have","no","meaning","plot","or","stori","line","nor","doe","it","have","a","intellig","in","it","the","blood","look","veri","fake","and","thi","movi","overal","be","pointless","do","not","even","wast","your","time","with","it","it","just","a","hour","or","two","of","mindless","violenc","it","have","mani","bloodi","scene","that","be","not","scari","but","just","plain","revolt","thi","be","probabl","the","wrong","horror","film","i","have","ever","watch","out","of","all","the","horror","film","i","ever","see"],"filtered":["believ","ey","onc","watch","thi","movi","point","either","blood","violenc","unlik","scari","movi","gore","mean","thi","movi","blood","gore","kill","anoth","thi","movi","interest","meaning","plot","stori","line","doe","intellig","blood","look","veri","fake","thi","movi","overal","pointless","even","wast","time","hour","two","mindless","violenc","mani","bloodi","scene","scari","plain","revolt","thi","probabl","wrong","horror","film","ever","watch","horror","film","ever","see"],"filtered2":["believ","ey","onc","watch","point","either","blood","violenc","unlik","scari","gore","mean","blood","gore","kill","anoth","interest","meaning","plot","stori","line","doe","intellig","blood","look","veri","fake","overal","pointless","even","wast","time","hour","two","mindless","violenc","mani","bloodi","scene","scari","plain","revolt","probabl","wrong","horror","ever","watch","horror","ever","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,8,15,16,17,18,19,25,32,44,47,50,60,66,73,76,83,88,89,91,107,148,174,207,236,281,354,358,396,412,453,531,586,603,615,639,1181,1819,2483,2523],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,8,15,16,17,18,19,25,32,44,47,50,60,66,73,76,83,88,89,91,107,148,174,207,236,281,354,358,396,412,453,531,586,603,615,639,1181,1819,2483,2523],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,3.209458785004948,1.7064694353107215,1.717994385570355,1.838176641236591,1.929723173391612,1.8950689206770979,2.1337665533324026,4.584637595480144,2.0317223413467334,1.9940046109572438,2.0105926690411424,2.1439533986393955,2.3018654096236517,2.456282578459816,2.5531798379045583,2.617923930016232,2.832333801361687,9.556563136746401,6.4061649450241624,6.583053029006414,3.107414446935464,6.83481352078442,3.4272107604888307,3.4572130107926293,3.530930586689197,3.5013187326425523,3.616452760127359,4.274508620876034,4.8085911068062925,5.322690055917252,5.2288713006995975]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.409702074900609E-4,2.4075667160687825E-4,2.4081611628889952E-4,2.4076770454651013E-4,2.4079049035382488E-4,2.4075534414722306E-4,2.4083022240173444E-4,2.407195236787007E-4,2.407567224883396E-4,2.4100551847254208E-4,2.4291782711448621E-4,2.4075712015618716E-4,2.4098513236326814E-4,2.4101023885640508E-4,2.4090075419782672E-4,2.4076865289565086E-4,2.4085148662392346E-4,2.4096483215235845E-4,2.4078108274307994E-4,2.4078020242355194E-4,2.409968208179647E-4,2.4080432614165332E-4,2.4080469057813218E-4,2.4095895264117189E-4,2.407811695988794E-4,2.4101311952363049E-4,2.408414241543335E-4,2.4075613202122122E-4,2.4086528056278396E-4,2.4093879611840715E-4,2.408055073258464E-4,2.409344775116555E-4,2.4105277032522785E-4,2.4127650467341226E-4,2.4084100797358156E-4,2.407685068656461E-4,2.408553175095273E-4,2.407929591559197E-4,2.4071978060217082E-4,2.4078100817709688E-4,2.4102231189432875E-4,2.408900959845996E-4,2.409350265598177E-4,2.407317611987819E-4,2.4078106940160764E-4,2.4076841632749476E-4,2.4084991425345304E-4,2.4089167792962202E-4,2.4084269396814224E-4,2.408045199756396E-4,2.4076901172928752E-4,2.4126230833403933E-4,2.4082959614816167E-4,2.4078101421489223E-4,2.4082830641647607E-4,2.407563783474731E-4,0.9809713522425287,2.4079394036305164E-4,2.4076934973816359E-4,2.407562409175926E-4,2.4094885168561987E-4,2.4085212877650381E-4,2.4075614027516237E-4,2.407316631192188E-4,2.4070745489132754E-4,2.4092509253415939E-4,2.4076793474448404E-4,2.4087737889248663E-4,2.409480702966882E-4,2.4083875684592358E-4,2.4078133312136925E-4,2.407319787023876E-4,2.4079356239037122E-4,2.4073184904116235E-4,2.4074448225927747E-4,2.4073198551570262E-4,2.4088825421425392E-4,2.4081655816085966E-4,2.407564616226397E-4,2.4077978339942247E-4]}}
{"value":"This film just goes around in circles, and the viewer does not know where they are. At first I thought..mmmmm, could be kinda cool movie this, but it just drags on and on, and eventually you don't know what's going on. The lead female is a good actress and played her role well, and the psycho fella, is creepy, but after a bit you don't really care what happens, because this film just drags on. Shame really, this could have turned out a lot better.<br /><br />Would say though that the lead female and psycho fella, will have a good career ahead of them , but will they remember this film, for making them known, or for being the film they regret they ever made.","finished_norm":["thi","film","just","go","around","in","circl","and","the","viewer","doe","not","know","where","thei","be","at","i","thoughtmmmmm","can","be","kinda","cool","movi","thi","but","it","just","drag","on","and","on","and","eventu","you","do","not","know","what","go","on","the","lead","femal","be","a","good","actress","and","plai","her","role","good","and","the","psycho","fella","be","creepi","but","after","a","bite","you","do","not","realli","care","what","happen","becaus","thi","film","just","drag","on","shame","realli","thi","can","have","turn","out","a","lot","betterbr","br","would","sai","though","that","the","lead","femal","and","psycho","fella","will","have","a","good","career","ahead","of","them","but","will","thei","rememb","thi","film","for","make","them","know","or","for","be","the","film","thei","regret","thei","ever","make"],"filtered":["thi","film","go","around","circl","viewer","doe","know","thei","thoughtmmmmm","kinda","cool","movi","thi","drag","eventu","know","go","lead","femal","good","actress","plai","role","good","psycho","fella","creepi","bite","realli","care","happen","becaus","thi","film","drag","shame","realli","thi","turn","lot","betterbr","br","sai","though","lead","femal","psycho","fella","good","career","ahead","thei","rememb","thi","film","make","know","film","thei","regret","thei","ever","make"],"filtered2":["go","around","circl","viewer","doe","know","thoughtmmmmm","kinda","cool","drag","eventu","know","go","lead","femal","good","actress","plai","role","good","psycho","fella","creepi","bite","realli","care","happen","becaus","drag","shame","realli","turn","lot","betterbr","though","lead","femal","psycho","fella","good","career","ahead","rememb","make","know","regret","ever","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,13,18,22,26,40,44,72,86,94,96,98,128,154,157,205,279,290,355,422,481,511,574,716,755,764,1322,1397,1678,1725,2169,2268,8059],"values":[2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,6,13,18,22,26,40,44,72,86,94,96,98,128,154,157,205,279,290,355,422,481,511,574,716,755,764,1322,1397,1678,1725,2169,2268,8059],"values":[1.2399534312410465,2.0358433949768115,1.9416538289407692,2.2635883139467947,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,3.9974772509130565,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,1.9209463754160525,2.031112399272319,2.08112281984698,2.0390708128715254,2.0881990796736947,2.3409902041158843,2.348499626138016,4.672030138951541,2.571852579609833,2.7910771187233068,2.8612813773965557,3.0316467233633775,6.418010981630407,3.353630724994973,3.3909310864081816,3.5039747767006686,3.6746621462132825,3.79165684915245,7.493177127501487,4.3521595551061,4.422928625994308,4.679973728984199,9.578346041898381,4.956227105612356,5.143104478942172,13.897314540605125]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.5603512040351983E-4,2.558082347393931E-4,2.558713957686224E-4,2.5581995743348244E-4,2.558441677579872E-4,2.5580682428995955E-4,2.5588638376375974E-4,2.557687644066796E-4,2.5580828880184843E-4,2.5607263894884255E-4,2.581045008063245E-4,2.5580871133099134E-4,2.560509783460781E-4,2.5607765444043924E-4,2.559613250483811E-4,2.558209650712687E-4,2.5590897737707473E-4,2.560294090118495E-4,2.5583417200467453E-4,2.5583323664955863E-4,2.5606339753655283E-4,2.558588685280096E-4,2.558592557482336E-4,2.56023161926908E-4,2.5583426429050233E-4,2.5608071520047084E-4,2.558982858246216E-4,2.5580766142006E-4,2.559236336818261E-4,2.5600174526388257E-4,2.5586012355716955E-4,2.559971566675945E-4,2.561228448805953E-4,2.5636056659471284E-4,2.558978436251894E-4,2.5582080991179803E-4,2.5591304776099083E-4,2.5584679090401096E-4,2.5576903739242454E-4,2.5583409277699467E-4,2.5609048225741553E-4,2.5595000050774463E-4,2.559977400410072E-4,2.5578176698886625E-4,2.558341578291235E-4,2.55820713713406E-4,2.559073067055552E-4,2.5595168135239554E-4,2.5589963502432053E-4,2.5585907448005867E-4,2.5582134633837355E-4,2.5634548273227814E-4,2.558857183582286E-4,2.5583409919225936E-4,2.558843479954321E-4,2.5580792314607254E-4,0.9797817241789059,2.558478334539958E-4,2.558217054788009E-4,2.558077771243864E-4,2.560124294824374E-4,2.559096596755835E-4,2.5580767019001886E-4,2.5578166277759047E-4,2.5575594110598864E-4,2.559871849625101E-4,2.5582020202291356E-4,2.559364883717663E-4,2.5601159924283526E-4,2.558954517621165E-4,2.5583443803604876E-4,2.5578199809030594E-4,2.5584743185131737E-4,2.557818603229539E-4,2.557952833413215E-4,2.5578200532957405E-4,2.559480435940783E-4,2.5587186526541906E-4,2.558080116274144E-4,2.558327914289874E-4]}}
{"value":"We had STARZ free weekend and I switched on the station to see what was on . It was this movie Howling II: The acting was terrible but the eye candy was great. Sybil Danning and Marsha Brown as the afore mentioned eye candy.

It was so bad that I actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table.<br /><br />Please people, stop watching this and all other reality shows, they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create.","finished_norm":["how","have","thi","piec","of","crap","stai","on","tv","thi","long","it","terribl","it","make","me","want","to","shoot","someon","it","so","fake","that","it","be","actual","wrong","than","a","scifi","movi","i","have","rather","have","a","stroke","than","watch","thi","nonsens","i","rememb","watch","it","when","it","come","out","i","think","hei","thi","can","be","interest","then","i","find","out","how","absolut","insan","ridicul","stupid","it","realli","be","it","be","so","bad","that","i","actual","take","out","my","pocket","knife","and","stick","my","hand","to","the","tablebr","br","pleas","peopl","stop","watch","thi","and","all","other","realiti","show","thei","re","the","trash","that","be","jam","the","network","and","cancel","qualiti","programm","that","requir","some","think","to","creat"],"filtered":["thi","piec","crap","stai","tv","thi","long","terribl","make","want","shoot","someon","fake","actual","wrong","scifi","movi","rather","stroke","watch","thi","nonsens","rememb","watch","come","think","hei","thi","interest","find","absolut","insan","ridicul","stupid","realli","bad","actual","take","pocket","knife","stick","hand","tablebr","br","pleas","peopl","stop","watch","thi","realiti","show","thei","re","trash","jam","network","cancel","qualiti","programm","requir","think","creat"],"filtered2":["piec","crap","stai","tv","long","terribl","make","want","shoot","someon","fake","actual","wrong","scifi","rather","stroke","watch","nonsens","rememb","watch","come","think","hei","interest","find","absolut","insan","ridicul","stupid","realli","bad","actual","take","pocket","knife","stick","hand","tablebr","pleas","peopl","stop","watch","realiti","show","re","trash","jam","network","cancel","qualiti","programm","requir","think","creat"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,9,12,13,23,25,28,31,34,37,38,52,60,68,99,117,136,139,160,166,172,218,222,235,274,290,313,315,319,346,362,366,416,639,656,671,781,905,974,989,1285,1706,1791,2374,2598,4115,4399,4574],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,7,9,12,13,23,25,28,31,34,37,38,52,60,68,99,117,136,139,160,166,172,218,222,235,274,290,313,315,319,346,362,366,416,639,656,671,781,905,974,989,1285,1706,1791,2374,2598,4115,4399,4574],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.8828493162168796,1.0683570856722073,2.133457220525776,1.1317941569733974,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,3.4244306149452273,1.838176641236591,2.0064197866819473,2.056430207256609,2.2797301185117202,2.346825985579986,2.2939035841256437,2.3722295531801256,2.4423870329693536,2.5001408943598484,2.5940874818617203,2.5771019354959765,2.6457189377809835,2.748952192422636,2.8612813773965557,2.907069060519773,2.854312708080462,2.9056060024680126,3.023389038124396,3.058539100262467,3.008694896185175,3.1401446412440817,3.616452760127359,3.68099128126493,3.6466665387238555,3.9363956947973615,3.9121030022283168,4.030886538218284,4.044492190274062,4.449957298382227,4.848596441419991,4.8184434032493035,5.259176650194926,5.1994574154933035,5.822646007446338,5.999576715605417,6.101359409915359]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255702E-4,2.2737792632708263E-4,2.2743406769354594E-4,2.2738834617097746E-4,2.2740986578072424E-4,2.2737667263379274E-4,2.274473899357232E-4,2.2734284269338727E-4,2.2737797438108291E-4,2.2761294487884273E-4,2.2941898734736614E-4,2.2737834995069825E-4,2.275936916169429E-4,2.2761740295299318E-4,2.2751400231007008E-4,2.2738924182076202E-4,2.2746747251417898E-4,2.275745194800719E-4,2.274009809468852E-4,2.2740014954633687E-4,2.276047305492106E-4,2.2742293271974006E-4,2.2742327690463963E-4,2.2756896669080755E-4,2.27401062976145E-4,2.2762012354277282E-4,2.2745796921172084E-4,2.2737741672596977E-4,2.2748049992975608E-4,2.2754993025739275E-4,2.2742404826603266E-4,2.2754585163377143E-4,2.2765757096628237E-4,2.2786887249241983E-4,2.274575761579553E-4,2.2738910390558218E-4,2.274710905191081E-4,2.274121973925425E-4,2.2734308533973007E-4,2.2740091052450193E-4,2.2762880509736254E-4,2.2750393636919393E-4,2.2754637017156207E-4,2.2735440017971104E-4,2.274009683467928E-4,2.2738901839859717E-4,2.2746598751966317E-4,2.2750543040620799E-4,2.2745916846251925E-4,2.274231157824546E-4,2.2738958071416693E-4,2.278554650375547E-4,2.2744679848279363E-4,2.2740091622677956E-4,2.2744558042094625E-4,2.2737764936397718E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.274131240744137E-4,2.2738989994003432E-4,2.2737751957101638E-4,2.2755942704103581E-4,2.2746807898261508E-4,2.2737742452124294E-4,2.2735430755038734E-4,2.2733144456336718E-4,2.2753698817546122E-4,2.2738856357694843E-4,2.2749192596045113E-4,2.275586890735529E-4,2.2745545012449857E-4,2.2740121741176002E-4,2.2735460559673441E-4,2.2741276710551352

{"value":"One of Scorsese's worst. An average thriller; the only thing to recommend it is De Niro playing the psycho. The finale is typically of this genre i.e. over-the-top, with yet another almost invincible, immune-to-pain villain. I didn't like the 60s original, and this version wasn't much of an improvement on it. I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time on a remake. Then again, considering how bad his recent movies have been (I'm referring to his dull Buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress, the blond girl Di Caprio) this isn't even that bad by comparison. And considering Spielberg wanted to do the remake... could have been far worse.","finished_norm":["on","of","scorses","wrong","a","averag","thriller","the","onli","thing","to","recommend","it","be","de","niro","plai","the","psycho","the","final","be","typic","of","thi","genr","ie","overthetop","with","yet","anoth","almost","invinc","immunetopain","villain","i","do","not","like","the","origin","and","thi","version","be","not","much","of","a","improv","on","it","i","have","no","idea","why","scorses","wast","hi","time","on","a","remak","then","again","consid","how","bad","hi","recent","movi","have","be","i","be","refer","to","hi","dull","buddhist","movi","and","all","the","on","with","hi","new","favourit","actress","the","blond","girl","di","caprio","thi","be","not","even","that","bad","by","comparison","and","consid","spielberg","want","to","do","the","remak","can","have","be","far","wrong"],"filtered":["scorses","wrong","averag","thriller","onli","thing","recommend","de","niro","plai","psycho","final","typic","thi","genr","ie","overthetop","yet","anoth","almost","invinc","immunetopain","villain","like","origin","thi","version","much","improv","idea","scorses","wast","hi","time","remak","consid","bad","hi","recent","movi","refer","hi","dull","buddhist","movi","hi","new","favourit","actress","blond","girl","di","caprio","thi","even","bad","comparison","consid","spielberg","want","remak","far","wrong"],"filtered2":["scorses","wrong","averag","thriller","onli","thing","recommend","de","niro","plai","psycho","final","typic","genr","ie","overthetop","yet","anoth","almost","invinc","immunetopain","villain","like","origin","version","improv","idea","scorses","wast","time","remak","consid","bad","recent","refer","dull","buddhist","new","favourit","actress","blond","girl","di","caprio","even","bad","comparison","consid","spielberg","want","remak","far","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,8,9,11,25,29,37,40,69,73,84,87,89,101,123,131,156,194,220,298,317,355,367,467,483,520,562,613,643,714,715,750,985,1117,1416,1526,1725,1921,2305,3016,3197,3846,5046,6223],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,8,9,11,25,29,37,40,69,73,84,87,89,101,123,131,156,194,220,298,317,355,367,467,483,520,562,613,643,714,715,750,985,1117,1416,1526,1725,1921,2305,3016,3197,3846,5046,6223],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,0.9913098153388195,2.559277576165403,1.3195384777338066,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,2.127032521151058,1.8950689206770979,2.2212694515902225,2.115024371522662,1.9940046109572438,2.098582041218749,2.2619070973220485,2.2512118082053005,2.3451551414151686,2.5378812223426954,2.8336934208777267,2.7819920465008363,5.705849565611229,3.0316467233633775,3.0791938792932125,3.342254038012865,7.226961979476402,3.5614461306151473,3.432149042129413,3.5364100524538222,3.5813614403160887,3.7297814454343623,3.68099128126493,4.030886538218284,4.170873731185678,4.181290492043933,4.484804029712395,4.535724120139652,4.789173020949191,4.869215728622727,5.064116067623542,5.7959777603641776,6.2980697041614135,13.086384324388797,6.255510089742618,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006077E-4,2.407566716068781E-4,2.408161162888994E-4,2.4076770454651E-4,2.4079049035382474E-4,2.4075534414722292E-4,2.408302224017343E-4,2.4071952367870055E-4,2.4075672248833946E-4,2.4100551847254195E-4,2.4291785041210677E-4,2.4075712015618703E-4,2.40985132363268E-4,2.4101023885640495E-4,2.409007541978266E-4,2.4076865289565072E-4,2.4085148662392333E-4,2.409648321523583E-4,2.407810827430798E-4,2.407802024235518E-4,2.4099682081796456E-4,2.408043261416532E-4,2.4080469057813204E-4,2.4095895264117175E-4,2.4078116959887926E-4,2.4101311952363035E-4,2.4084142415433337E-4,2.407561320212211E-4,2.4086528056278383E-4,2.4093879611840701E-4,2.4080550732584626E-4,2.4093447751165537E-4,2.4105277032522771E-4,2.4127650467341212E-4,2.4084100797358142E-4,2.4076850686564595E-4,2.4085531750952718E-4,2.407929591559196E-4,2.407197806021707E-4,2.4078100817709675E-4,2.410223118943286E-4,2.4089009598459945E-4,2.4093502655981756E-4,2.4073176119878176E-4,2.407810694016075E-4,2.4076841632749462E-4,2.4084991425345293E-4,2.408916779296219E-4,2.408426939681421E-4,2.4080451997563946E-4,2.4076901172928738E-4,2.412623083340392E-4,2.4082959614816154E-4,2.407810142148921E-4,2.4082830641647594E-4,2.4075637834747296E-4,0.980971352219231,2.407939403630515E-4,2.4076934973816348E-4,2.4075624091759247E-4,2.4094885168561973E-4,2.4085212877650368E-4,2.4075614027516224E-4,2.4073166311921866E-4,2.4070745489132743E-4,2.4092509253415925E-4,2.407679347444839E-4,2.408773788924865E-4,2.4094807029668806E-4,2.4083875684592344E-4,2.407813331213691E-4,2.407319787023875E-4,2.4079356239037109E-4,2.4073184904116222E-4,2.4074448225927734E-4,2.407319855157025E-4,2.408882542142538E-4,2.4081655816

{"value":"Strange... I like all this movie crew and dark humor movies; but didn't like this one at all! It's awful, horrible and surely not funny at all. Pity cannot do a whole movie plot, disgust either. And it was really boring. Long empty moments fills the movie; it could have been removed. It should have been in another shorter format, surely. Maybe i expected too much from the crew - like saving the movie lol -. It's also filled with overused clichés of characters and situations... I don't get it why people liked it... \"Poetry\", \"hope\"; nope 'mam, didn't see anything like that! ^^ All in all, it's empty and crude, pitiful and hopeless.

{"value":"OK - the helicopter shots are fantastic, and the director made good use of some of Barcelona's top sights. Otherwise...production value was blown in the first few minutes and the rest of the film felt like a movie of the week. Ellen Pompeo was charming and fun to watch, Abel Folk had the most depth and was very effective, and William Baldwin was...well, William Baldwin. He got to put his martial art training to good use and be a running-jumping-earnest action figure. The rest of the cast was wooden at best, but mostly paper. So - if you're nostalgic about Spain - it's a picture postcard with an action twist, and a healthy dose of El Greco. If not, skip it.","finished_norm":["okai","the","helicopt","shot","be","fantast","and","the","director","make","good","us","of","some","of","barcelona","top","sight","otherwiseproduct","valu","be","blow","in","the","few","minut","and","the","rest","of","the","film","feel","like","a","movi","of","the","week","ellen","pompeo","be","charm","and","fun","to","watch","abel","folk","have","the","much","depth","and","be","veri","effect","and","william","baldwin","waswel","william","baldwin","he","get","to","put","hi","martial","art","train","to","good","us","and","be","a","runningjumpingearnest","action","figur","the","rest","of","the","cast","be","wooden","at","well","but","mostli","paper","so","if","you","re","nostalg","about","spain","it","a","pictur","postcard","with","a","action","twist","and","a","healthi","dose","of","el","greco","if","not","skip","it"],"filtered":["okai","helicopt","shot","fantast","director","make","good","us","barcelona","top","sight","otherwiseproduct","valu","blow","minut","rest","film","feel","like","movi","week","ellen","pompeo","charm","fun","watch","abel","folk","much","depth","veri","effect","william","baldwin","waswel","william","baldwin","get","put","hi","martial","art","train","good","us","runningjumpingearnest","action","figur","rest","cast","wooden","well","mostli","paper","re","nostalg","spain","pictur","postcard","action","twist","healthi","dose","el","greco","skip"],"filtered2":["okai","helicopt","shot","fantast","director","make","good","us","barcelona","top","sight","otherwiseproduct","valu","blow","minut","rest","feel","like","week","ellen","pompeo","charm","fun","watch","abel","folk","depth","veri","effect","william","baldwin","waswel","william","baldwin","get","put","martial","art","train","good","us","runningjumpingearnest","action","figur","rest","cast","wooden","well","mostli","paper","re","nostalg","spain","pictur","postcard","action","twist","healthi","dose","el","greco","skip"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,15,20,43,56,58,59,68,92,106,129,159,191,226,259,311,364,382,415,435,441,451,510,713,720,754,797,857,891,914,931,1008,1280,1386,1392,1400,2372,2514,3008,3324,4278,4302,4349,4585],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,7,15,20,43,56,58,59,68,92,106,129,159,191,226,259,311,364,382,415,435,441,451,510,713,720,754,797,857,891,914,931,1008,1280,1386,1392,1400,2372,2514,3008,3324,4278,4302,4349,4585],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.6608112036218214,3.7221218701403576,1.865701314626681,1.8693254449200722,2.0064197866819473,2.0489535369135887,2.159084361316692,4.821391668015843,2.300267965194495,2.5460113484259455,5.188174963723441,2.7464553122240485,2.9203338091782562,2.9878441007049847,3.235085203598255,3.1588018988486244,3.2829611516442836,3.293679367864308,3.216957819005698,3.374440724508766,3.865219416329466,7.715229633888494,3.7465885637507435,3.7987743169213135,3.9612932464190886,3.8767358583910254,3.9612932464190886,3.9241755834625858,4.086456389373095,4.364659717870332,4.715065048795469,4.403125998698128,4.436351646326448,5.290429193699031,11.003476574732474,5.390512652256013,5.999576715605417,5.878215858601149,5.907203395474402,6.137727054086234,6.1754673820690815]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164652E-4,2.2324275812784207E-4,2.2329787848933356E-4,2.2325298847309996E-4,2.232741167202931E-4,2.2324152723462214E-4,2.2331095844892393E-4,2.2320831253640842E-4,2.2324280530791683E-4,2.2347350255652802E-4,2.2524669975505115E-4,2.2324317404730218E-4,2.2345459944064991E-4,2.2347787955470617E-4,2.2337635938917726E-4,2.2325386783430905E-4,2.2333067579913997E-4,2.234357759744348E-4,2.2326539346890375E-4,2.232645771884736E-4,2.2346543761534015E-4,2.2328694601974754E-4,2.2328728394518967E-4,2.234303241699844E-4,2.2326547400635305E-4,2.2348055066696385E-4,2.2332134532680102E-4,2.232422577944992E-4,2.2334346629394167E-4,2.234116339392787E-4,2.2328804127835598E-4,2.2340762949082016E-4,2.2351731705956887E-4,2.2372477578809863E-4,2.2332095942123787E-4,2.232537324272991E-4,2.2333422800586622E-4,2.2327640592866788E-4,2.2320855076990667E-4,2.2326532432724464E-4,2.2348907433600578E-4,2.2336647651074378E-4,2.234081385983155E-4,2.2321965983456362E-4,2.232653810979607E-4,2.2325364847537165E-4,2.233292178112127E-4,2.2336794337671955E-4,2.233225227676382E-4,2.2328712575322458E-4,2.2325420056448937E-4,2.2371161216552576E-4,2.2331037775234785E-4,2.232653299258188E-4,2.2330918184256551E-4,2.2324248620167686E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.2327731575760414E-4,2.2325451398481233E-4,2.2324235876917264E-4,2.2342095801135582E-4,2.2333127123814575E-4,2.23242265448005E-4,2.232195688898266E-4,2.231971216964518E-4,2.233989272262174E-4,2.232532019252

{"value":"SPOILER ALERT ! ! !

-these are just things in this film,only for keep you wait the end.Clark Johnson as the director of S.W.A.T. did a far better work like this time,and I still wondering how the producers (for example Michael Douglas)left this film to theaters.","finished_norm":["spoiler","alert","person","i","do","not","understand","why","pete","do","not","help","to","save","william","lifei","mean","that","would","be","great","to","know","why","william","be","motivatedor","forcedi","think","secret","servic","member","be","everi","dai","peopleand","there","be","a","rumor","the","writer","be","a","member","of","the","secret","servicenow","he","motiv","be","clearwel","knownbut","a","a","rental","thi","film","will","not","satisfi","youcaus","the","old","but","us","twiststh","averag","act","thi","be","just","thing","in","thi","filmonli","for","keep","you","wait","the","endclark","johnson","a","the","director","of","swat","do","a","far","well","work","like","thi","timeand","i","still","wonder","how","the","produc","for","exampl","michael","douglasleft","thi","film","to","theater"],"filtered":["spoiler","alert","person","understand","pete","help","save","william","lifei","mean","great","know","william","motivatedor","forcedi","think","secret","servic","member","everi","dai","peopleand","rumor","writer","member","secret","servicenow","motiv","clearwel","knownbut","rental","thi","film","satisfi","youcaus","old","us","twiststh","averag","act","thi","thing","thi","filmonli","keep","wait","endclark","johnson","director","swat","far","well","work","like","thi","timeand","still","wonder","produc","exampl","michael","douglasleft","thi","film","theater"],"filtered2":["spoiler","alert","person","understand","pete","help","save","william","lifei","mean","great","know","william","motivatedor","forcedi","think","secret","servic","member","everi","dai","peopleand","rumor","writer","member","secret","servicenow","motiv","clearwel","knownbut","rental","satisfi","youcaus","old","us","twiststh","averag","act","thing","filmonli","keep","wait","endclark","johnson","director","swat","far","well","work","like","timeand","still","wonder","produc","exampl","michael","douglasleft","theater"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,12,20,21,26,29,48,51,56,58,64,67,85,88,101,132,134,153,175,185,189,212,261,287,307,331,424,466,490,618,643,720,798,902,1505,1632,1685,2143,3157,4213,4348,5123],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,12,20,21,26,29,48,51,56,58,64,67,85,88,101,132,134,153,175,185,189,212,261,287,307,331,424,466,490,618,643,720,798,902,1505,1632,1685,2143,3157,4213,4348,5123],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,1.8610609350701788,1.865701314626681,1.883428577602134,1.9570915389266579,2.011190219103739,2.0317223413467334,2.098582041218749,2.253494045787767,2.2443961816702407,2.3409902041158843,2.3791142619576227,2.518833027372001,2.498193474075453,2.5983793339432615,2.7085302779237206,2.841890188081905,2.8767855639325206,2.932274249550174,3.212973749990824,3.4446025032006995,3.3490645070153917,7.128534013913577,3.5813614403160887,7.715229633888494,7.856464768316401,3.9201351739255808,4.535724120139652,4.6973654716960676,4.662879295624898,5.3064295350454715,5.583416318380505,6.2980697041614135,5.999576715605417,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6717037937823456E-4,2.669336261981838E-4,2.6699953417250584E-4,2.669458587255896E-4,2.6697112198467926E-4,2.669321544066981E-4,2.67015174012621E-4,2.668924392557493E-4,2.6693368261187687E-4,2.6720952964782177E-4,2.6932975949149347E-4,2.669341235172934E-4,2.671869270007747E-4,2.6721476326885995E-4,2.670933745790582E-4,2.669469101866907E-4,2.6703875024791E-4,2.6716441959163603E-4,2.6696069150467124E-4,2.669597154698961E-4,2.6719988631598694E-4,2.66986462107932E-4,2.6698686616880463E-4,2.671579008138558E-4,2.6696078780411475E-4,2.6721795714483115E-4,2.670275937076645E-4,2.669330279445399E-4,2.6705404397204657E-4,2.671355527157648E-4,2.6698777171973943E-4,2.671307645561984E-4,2.6726191909272405E-4,2.6750997959492046E-4,2.670271322764754E-4,2.6694674827915793E-4,2.6704299765745827E-4,2.6697385921431097E-4,2.6689272411395523E-4,2.6696060883128937E-4,2.6722814898220564E-4,2.670815575212524E-4,2.6713137330118525E-4,2.6690600733504346E-4,2.6696067671260935E-4,2.6694664789698834E-4,2.670370069169834E-4,2.6708331146775143E-4,2.6702900158559494E-4,2.6698667701707026E-4,2.6694730803553617E-4,2.6749423971813007E-4,2.6701447966784547E-4,2.669606155255612E-4,2.6701304970641035E-4,2.6693330105331483E-4,0.9789024083376444,2.669749471059819E-4,2.669476827953897E-4,2.669331486809793E-4,2.671467016031525E-4,2.6703946222035797E-4,2.669330370959143E-4,2.669058985915006E-4,2.6687905825510737E-4,2.6712035917030356E-4,2.6694611395249366E-4,2.670674577270919E-4,2.671458352554845E-4,2.670246363885535E-4,2.669609691060529E-4,2.6690624848734796E-4,2.669745280371457E-4,2.669061047283368E-4,2.6692011152906016E-4,2.6690625604146003

{"value":"True, the setting in Paris is great. The actors are fine. The story is a twisted morality play. Is it supposed to say that if you want someone badly enough, it's OK to hurt everyone else along the way? In a real romance, you sort of want less cliché than the man who has become bored with his wife and is willing to dump his family, and the woman who is OK with encouraging him to do this. So what if they are decent looking and if Karen Allen shows off her body? The characters are still self-absorbed and reprehensible. Maybe the moral of the story is \"you get what you deserve\". I give it a 4, only for the fast scan potential through the \"male interest\" bits.","finished_norm":["true","the","set","in","pari","be","great","the","actor","be","fine","the","stori","be","a","twist","moral","plai","be","it","suppos","to","sai","that","if","you","want","someon","badli","enough","it","okai","to","hurt","everyon","els","along","the","wai","in","a","real","romanc","you","sort","of","want","littl","cliché","than","the","man","who","have","becom","bore","with","hi","wife","and","be","will","to","dump","hi","famili","and","the","woman","who","be","okai","with","encourag","him","to","do","thi","so","what","if","thei","be","decent","look","and","if","karen","allen","show","off","her","bodi","the","charact","be","still","selfabsorb","and","reprehens","mayb","the","moral","of","the","stori","be","you","get","what","you","deserv","i","give","it","a","onli","for","the","fast","scan","potenti","through","the","male","interest","bit"],"filtered":["true","set","pari","great","actor","fine","stori","twist","moral","plai","suppos","sai","want","someon","badli","enough","okai","hurt","everyon","els","along","wai","real","romanc","sort","want","littl","cliché","man","becom","bore","hi","wife","dump","hi","famili","woman","okai","encourag","thi","thei","decent","look","karen","allen","show","bodi","charact","still","selfabsorb","reprehens","mayb","moral","stori","get","deserv","give","onli","fast","scan","potenti","male","interest","bit"],"filtered2":["true","set","pari","great","actor","fine","stori","twist","moral","plai","suppos","want","someon","badli","enough","okai","hurt","everyon","els","along","wai","real","romanc","sort","want","littl","cliché","man","becom","bore","wife","dump","famili","woman","okai","encourag","decent","look","karen","allen","show","bodi","charact","still","selfabsorb","reprehens","mayb","moral","stori","get","deserv","give","onli","fast","scan","potenti","male","interest","bit"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,10,11,14,16,17,28,30,33,37,40,41,45,51,60,64,70,80,93,108,109,115,139,149,163,182,191,196,246,263,269,304,309,324,376,423,435,448,464,523,542,547,649,863,878,892,1345,1382,1886,2165,2257,2869,6719,6959],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,10,11,14,16,17,28,30,33,37,40,41,45,51,60,64,70,80,93,108,109,115,139,149,163,182,191,196,246,263,269,304,309,324,376,423,435,448,464,523,542,547,649,863,878,892,1345,1382,1886,2165,2257,2869,6719,6959],"values":[0.7966340470719924,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,2.975308642954861,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.8162961064622165,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,1.883428577602134,2.094675786251684,1.9951803900462557,2.035389827120098,2.138507503627933,2.125691139326857,2.201553588425805,2.2939035841256437,2.3253197803590226,2.4000574358028657,2.7365296724240786,5.092022696851891,2.478925055209576,2.673149229007135,2.902686292364678,2.76533567167316,2.871119826396843,2.848772527704847,2.8753661172782943,3.1569204307489187,3.164467636384302,3.2829611516442836,3.2681460658591432,3.2872346624216657,3.4986697244709752,3.4471119148061256,3.432149042129413,3.6375061693251913,3.944626193933877,8.135175810137424,3.9825254665248626,4.760735085628657,4.449957298382227,5.1994574154933035,5.039114765418124,5.064116067623542,5.878215858601149,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852437E-4,2.081041609493374E-4,2.0815554347424262E-4,2.0811369755170683E-4,2.081333930445924E-4,2.081030135257753E-4,2.081677364521409E-4,2.0807205119149433E-4,2.0810420493002442E-4,2.0831925807556948E-4,2.0997221075493504E-4,2.0810454866435668E-4,2.0830163682280354E-4,2.0832333825958522E-4,2.0822870240647177E-4,2.0811451728144017E-4,2.0818611672416973E-4,2.0828408981847648E-4,2.08125261336642E-4,2.0812450041003707E-4,2.0831174003631446E-4,2.081453523601864E-4,2.0814566737013877E-4,2.0827900771323675E-4,2.081253364126644E-4,2.083258282376694E-4,2.08177418972298E-4,2.08103694544732E-4,2.0819803986654243E-4,2.0826158490941737E-4,2.0814637334682734E-4,2.0825785201168077E-4,2.083601014178987E-4,2.0855349190005524E-4,2.0817705923586533E-4,2.081143910566863E-4,2.0818942804771046E-4,2.0813552701656114E-4,2.0807227326983936E-4,2.0812519688363543E-4,2.0833377389740346E-4,2.0821948970841422E-4,2.082583265954435E-4,2.0808262900365467E-4,2.0812524980460065E-4,2.0811431279772925E-4,2.0818475760570683E-4,2.0822085710288504E-4,2.0817851656820455E-4,2.081455199055292E-4,2.0811482744843314E-4,2.0854122093255084E-4,2.081671951339152E-4,2.0812520210255762E-4,2.081660803214845E-4,2.0810390746310153E-4,0.9835521036690726,2.0813637514793603E-4,2.0811511961501397E-4,2.081037886720841E-4,2.0827027669504351E-4,2.081866717851076E-4,2.0810370167923

{"value":"I love Memoirs of a Geisha so I read the book twice; it is one of the best book I've read last year. I was looking forward to the movie and was afraid that reading the book would ruin the viewing pleasure of the movie. I wasn't expecting the movie to be that bad. Some of the best part of the book was omitted from the movie and the characters were weak with Hatsumomo (Li Gong)been the worst. If I haven't read the book, this movie would be a little confusing and inexplicable. The Plot Outline of the movie states \"Nitta Sayuri reveals how she transcended her fishing...\" Did anyone see how or when Sayuri became Nitta Sayuri?

{"value":"Minimal script, minimal character development, minimal steady camera. Maximum stretched scenes, maximum headache inducing jerky zooms, maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing. Up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm, you can fast forward and miss nothing, since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing. To be fair, the movie does have some string music that was interesting, so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this. Unfortunately that was not to be, and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief.

{"value":"Even if it were remotely funny, this mouldy waxwork of a film would still be soberingly disrespectful. Stopping just short of digging up the boys' corpses and re-enacting 'Weekend At Bernie's'  but only just  producer Larry Harmon and the director of the frickin' 'Ernest' films use holding the copyright as an excuse to crap all over Stan and Ollie's legacy. Gailard Sartain does a fair Ollie impersonation but Bronson Pinchot wouldn't reach tenth place in a Stan lookalike contest; even if they were both spot on the film would be no less detestable.

{"value":"Pretty standard B-movie stuff. Seriously, anyone who watches \"Dragon Fighter\" with Dean Cain and a bunch of people making their first movie should know better than to expect real quality or even moderate intelligence. B movies exist to re-work formulas that are popular. If you give them even token analysis, you'll wind up ruining the movie for yourself (and perhaps writing some self-important, slanderous review on IMDb).<br /><br />I liked the female lead, Kristine Byers. She had charisma and I thought she was notably attractive. It was a memorable B-movie appearance. Unfortunately, I don't see where she has made any movies since. I'll watch for her again.","finished_norm":["pretti","standard","bmovi","stuff","serious","anyon","who","watch","dragon","fighter","with","dean","cain","and","a","bunch","of","peopl","make","their","movi","should","know","well","than","to","expect","real","qualiti","or","even","moder","intellig","b","movi","exist","to","rework","formula","that","be","popular","if","you","give","them","even","token","analysi","you","will","wind","up","ruin","the","movi","for","yourself","and","perhap","write","some","selfimport","slander","review","on","imdbbr","br","i","like","the","femal","lead","kristin","byer","she","have","charisma","and","i","think","she","be","notabl","attract","it","be","a","memor","bmovi","appear","unfortun","i","do","not","see","where","she","have","make","ani","movi","sinc","i","will","watch","for","her","again"],"filtered":["pretti","standard","bmovi","stuff","serious","anyon","watch","dragon","fighter","dean","cain","bunch","peopl","make","movi","know","well","expect","real","qualiti","even","moder","intellig","b","movi","exist","rework","formula","popular","give","even","token","analysi","wind","ruin","movi","perhap","write","selfimport","slander","review","imdbbr","br","like","femal","lead","kristin","byer","charisma","think","notabl","attract","memor","bmovi","appear","unfortun","see","make","ani","movi","sinc","watch"],"filtered2":["pretti","standard","bmovi","stuff","serious","anyon","watch","dragon","fighter","dean","cain","bunch","peopl","make","know","well","expect","real","qualiti","even","moder","intellig","b","exist","rework","formula","popular","give","even","token","analysi","wind","ruin","perhap","write","selfimport","slander","review","imdbbr","like","femal","lead","kristin","byer","charisma","think","notabl","attract","memor","bmovi","appear","unfortun","see","make","ani","sinc","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,7,12,20,23,26,27,30,65,78,80,130,157,158,162,170,176,227,318,319,361,371,419,422,528,603,616,642,648,710,951,1009,1074,1176,1286,1477,1722,1847,1907,2355,2623,3339,3811,4236,5084,7805],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,7,12,20,23,26,27,30,65,78,80,130,157,158,162,170,176,227,318,319,361,371,419,422,528,603,616,642,648,710,951,1009,1074,1176,1286,1477,1722,1847,1907,2355,2623,3339,3811,4236,5084,7805],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.852034211452262,1.9218995441445863,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.9073850067444174,2.0064197866819473,1.9951803900462557,2.2642139034199635,2.3360150694757706,2.3106972614914807,2.3586007221245198,2.4214486257841834,2.5040471493269134,2.6005321873043625,2.902686292364678,2.9056060024680126,3.0399731661399314,3.0466846007279185,3.1758963322079246,3.2090054908152035,3.4198487640477615,3.530930586689197,3.5173618574831282,3.622422927113863,3.6105180246075443,3.6528204042982337,4.004218291136122,4.096025840389245,4.110553940952155,4.358390104856736,8.998179973919743,5.089758498236879,4.724033718778229,5.156897801074508,5.444579873526289,5.3064295350454715,5.214056214914456,5.626901430320244,5.7959777603641776,5.999576715605417,6.137727054086234,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255705E-4,2.2737792632708265E-4,2.2743406769354596E-4,2.2738834617097752E-4,2.2740986578072427E-4,2.2737667263379277E-4,2.2744738993572323E-4,2.2734284269338733E-4,2.2737797438108294E-4,2.2761294487884276E-4,2.2941898734736617E-4,2.2737834995069828E-4,2.2759369161694292E-4,2.276174029529932E-4,2.275140023100701E-4,2.2738924182076205E-4,2.27467472514179E-4,2.2757451948007191E-4,2.2740098094688521E-4,2.274001495463369E-4,2.2760473054921063E-4,2.2742293271974009E-4,2.2742327690463966E-4,2.2756896669080758E-4,2.2740106297614504E-4,2.2762012354277285E-4,2.2745796921172086E-4,2.2737741672596983E-4,2.274804999297561E-4,2.2754993025739278E-4,2.274240482660327E-4,2.2754585163377146E-4,2.276575709662824E-4,2.2786887249241986E-4,2.2745757615795533E-4,2.273891039055822E-4,2.2747109051910816E-4,2.2741219739254252E-4,2.273430853397301E-4,2.2740091052450196E-4,2.2762880509736257E-4,2.2750393636919395E-4,2.275463701715621E-4,2.2735440017971107E-4,2.2740096834679283E-4,2.273890183985972E-4,2.274659875196632E-4,2.27505430406208E-4,2.2745916846251928E-4,2.2742311578245462E-4,2.2738958071416695E-4,2.2785546503755472E-4,2.2744679848279366E-4,2.2740091622677958E-4,2.2744558042094628E-4,2.273776493639772E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441373E-4,2.2738989994003437E-4,2.273775195710164E-4,2.2755942704103584E-4,2.274680789826151E-4,2.27377424521243E-4,2.2735430755038737E-4,2.273314445633672E-4,2.2753698817546124E-4,2.2738856357694845E-4,2.2749192596045116E-4,2.2755868907355293E-4,2.274554501244986E-4,2.27401217

{"value":"This movie forever left an impression on me. I watched it as a Freshman in High School and was home alone that night. I think I lost all respect for Robert Reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the \"Brady Bunch\". I also thought the role of Chuck Connor was horrendous and evil. However, this movie made such an impact on me that I am now a volunteer in the women's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change womens lives, one at a time. What fascinates me is that so few people actually watched this movie. None of my friends watched it and my family is clueless to this day when I discuss this movie because they didn't see

more dull than number three,and i would have thought that impossible.this is a very slow 90 minutes.painful,in fact.i stuck it through,hoping it would get better.if you really want to see this movie,you should try to find a cheap rental of it.it is hard to find(for purchase,that is)and probably for good reason.like number three,this movie has nothing to do with the first two.it is the same in name only.anyway,the most i can give Best of the Best:Without Warning is

{"value":"I felt brain dead, I'll tell you. This is the worst film I have ever bought. (in my ignorance I thought this was the Peter Jackson film of the same name). The performances are so terrible they are laughable. The special effects have not stood the test of time and look dire. The script promotes that kind of TV movie, stare into the middle distance kind of acting. The cast look as if they have been taking lessons from Joey Tribbiani, they have one look each, and stick to it. Plus I have never been confused by a movie until I sat down to watch this. The is it a dream or no plot is so terrible that frustration sets in within a few minutes.

{"value":"I had the misfortune to watch this rubbish on Sky Cinema Max in a cold winter night. I am not a big fan of horror movies, because most of them are just trash. This one is even worse: it is one of the dumbest pieces of crap i've ever seen in my whole life. Horror movie? Yes, there are horrible things in this: the acting, the script and the special effects - Gosh, i laughed at this ludicrous attempt to make a flick for 90 minutes.
