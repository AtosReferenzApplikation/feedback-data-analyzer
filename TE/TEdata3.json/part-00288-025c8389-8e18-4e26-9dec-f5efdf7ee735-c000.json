{"value":"Quite possibly. How Francis Veber, one of the best comedy directors in the world (at least when sticking to his native France), managed to turn in a film so completely unwatchable is beyond the reason of mere mortal man to discern. It's not just that the characters are so unlikeable or that the film is so utterly devoid of even the lowest form of wit: it's genuinely physically painful to watch, such an endless parade of inept writing, acting and film-making that you cannot believe this is the work of experienced - and talented - filmmakers. For once the near-eternity spent in the cutting room and on the shelf before its blink-and-you'll-miss-it theatrical release tells the whole story.

{"value":"This show is painful to watch ...<br /><br />It is obvious that the creators had no clue what to do with this show, from the ever changing \"jobs\", boyfriends, and cast. It appears that they wanted to cast Amanda Bynes in something ... but had no idea what, and came up with this crappy show. They cast her as a teen, surrounded by twenty and thirty somethings, and put her in mostly adult situations at repeatedly failed attempts at comedy. Soon, they realize that she needs a \"clique\" and cast people in their late 20s to try to pass as teenagers.<br /><br />How this show survived 4 seasons is beyond me. Somehow, ABC has now decided that it is a \"family\" show, and thrown it into it's afternoon lineup on ABC

The film contains some blood (not enough to disturb) and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands. (Yes you read that correctly.)<br /><br />One saving grace was a song performed at the \"talent show\" (how's that for irony?) by a punk/new wave band that I think was called \"I'm A Heat Seeking Missile\". Other than that, this is not worth your time, not even on a \"so bad it's good\" level. Watch if you are into cheesy alien films, but anyone else should steer clear. <br /><br />Rating: 1 out of

{"value":"This movie is the worst movie i have ever seen... it is humorous how bad it is.. the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts dancing..(i've seen porno's with a better plot) When the raptor was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away. But as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it isn't going to do anything compared to if you watch it .. i don't recommend renting it but if it comes on TV watch it for about 30min just to see what i mean. I couldn't watch more than 30min but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good

{"value":"I own this movie. Not by choice, I do. I was really bored the other day and the box intrigued me. So i popped it in the old VCR and spent the next hour and a half of my life crying \"why God why?\". The story-line was not that bad, as an gamer I could appreciate bits of it. I think that maybe if you're into super geeky-cheese romantic scenes you'll enjoy this film. \"I always thought of myself as a Vulcan you know like Dr.Spock...unable to love\" There is very few good things to say about this film, truly it is awful. But if you're up to really badly made film this is the one for you!!! The real story's much more interesting though ;)<br /><br />If I had to sum up this film in one word it would be:<br /><br

{"value":"I watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it's about. Somebody got murdered or maybe they didn't and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didn't. This brought back memories of the good old days (bad old days?) when all CBC Canadian movies were stinkers. Lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism, mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time. I've never found Margaret Atwood's books easy to read. This movie continues that fine Canadian tradition. It isn't easy to watch. Maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi Toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it.

{"value":"Robert DeNiro plays the most unbelievably intelligent illiterate of all time. This movie is so wasteful of talent, it is truly disgusting. The script is unbelievable. The dialog is unbelievable. Jane Fonda's character is a caricature of herself, and not a funny one. The movie moves at a snail's pace, is photographed in an ill-advised manner, and is insufferably preachy. It also plugs in every cliche in the book. Swoozie Kurtz is excellent in a supporting role, but so what?<br /><br />Equally annoying is this new IMDB rule of requiring ten lines for every review. When a movie is this worthless, it doesn't require ten lines of text to let other readers know that it is a waste of time and tape. Avoid this

{"value":"I don't know where to begin. The cast is full of people who've never done anything before or since. Debralee Scott is listed on cover boxes, but does not appear in the movie at all. The writing is quite bad, even for college films. It's obviously very low budget, with one scene at the sorority house having extremely choppy editing.<br /><br />The characters are pretty typical for college films - timid guy, nerd, suave black guy, tough guys, guy with mustache, attractive girl, small town girl, etc. The featured teacher is about what's you'd expect... middle aged heavy set guy who gets sidetracked easily.<br /><br />If you wan't to see a college flick, stay clear from this one.

{"value":"Seriously, I absolutely love these old movies and their simplicity but I just watched this for the first time last night and it easily slotted itself into my bottom five of all time. Was this supposed to be about the love story or the zombies??? This movie was so bad that after it mercifully ended all I could do is laugh at how ridiculously bad it really was. Thankfully I'm too anal to turn a movie off without seeing the entire thing or I wouldn't be able to brag about watching this all the way through in one sitting! I like to think something positive can be said about anything in life so in keeping with that theory I will acknowledge this film's most positive asset, it was very short for a full length

{"value":"I cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie. <br /><br />The 1972 movie with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor and Baldwin is only an inadequate actor. He has no passion in his play.Also the action in the original \"Getaway\" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It is almost boring despite the fact that the film-making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. <br /><br />I don't understand the way that Baldwin imprisoned from Mexico. I think this is a mistake in the story.<br /><br />So i think that there was no need to remake it, or if they decided to remake a classic, they must choose an excellent actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt...","finished_norm":["i","cannot","see","why","filmmak","remak","thi","movi","br","br","the","movi","with","mcqueen","and","mcgraw","be","almost","a","classic","steve","mcqueen","be","a","outstand","actor","and","baldwin","be","onli","a","inadequ","actor","he","have","no","passion","in","hi","playalso","the","action","in","the","origin","getawai","be","fantast","but","the","remak","have","no","action","it","be","almost","bore","despit","the","fact","that","the","filmmak","in","be","much","difficult","than","in","br","br","i","do","not","understand","the","wai","that","baldwin","imprison","from","mexico","i","think","thi","be","a","mistak","in","the","storybr","br","so","i","think","that","there","be","no","ne","to","remak","it","or","if","thei","decid","to","remak","a","classic","thei","must","choos","a","excel","actor","for","the","role","like","johnni","depp","or","brad","pitt"],"filtered":["see","filmmak","remak","thi","movi","br","br","movi","mcqueen","mcgraw","almost","classic","steve","mcqueen","outstand","actor","baldwin","onli","inadequ","actor","passion","hi","playalso","action","origin","getawai","fantast","remak","action","almost","bore","despit","fact","filmmak","much","difficult","br","br","understand","wai","baldwin","imprison","mexico","think","thi","mistak","storybr","br","think","ne","remak","thei","decid","remak","classic","thei","must","choos","excel","actor","role","like","johnni","depp","brad","pitt"],"filtered2":["see","filmmak","remak","mcqueen","mcgraw","almost","classic","steve","mcqueen","outstand","actor","baldwin","onli","inadequ","actor","passion","playalso","action","origin","getawai","fantast","remak","action","almost","bore","despit","fact","filmmak","difficult","understand","wai","baldwin","imprison","mexico","think","mistak","storybr","think","ne","remak","decid","remak","classic","must","choos","excel","actor","role","like","johnni","depp","brad","pitt"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,11,12,33,41,69,97,108,110,128,129,131,141,212,249,323,332,391,483,580,584,592,803,1104,1392,1464,1674,1930,2422,2514,2768,3062,3587,5420,5708,6737,6940,7863],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,11,12,33,41,69,97,108,110,128,129,131,141,212,249,323,332,391,483,580,584,592,803,1104,1392,1464,1674,1930,2422,2514,2768,3062,3587,5420,5708,6737,6940,7863],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,1.4018535447685214,4.70627975028631,2.127032521151058,2.0545557924622586,2.138507503627933,2.1290479736304078,2.3409902041158843,4.821391668015843,4.502423616410601,2.2657547357741192,2.5983793339432615,2.6754694156628323,6.0866465060504265,5.941068926339787,3.109204957709252,14.453923958952805,3.5039747767006686,3.5146700658174166,3.5227672760500357,3.7636829971100436,4.613282354485526,4.403125998698128,4.589376833631972,4.9909126636002465,4.848596441419991,5.116075806554253,11.003476574732474,5.390512652256013,5.604922523601468,5.967828017290836,6.255510089742618,13.897314540605125,6.543192162194399,6.660975197850782,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.363349508791836E-4,2.3612552253122075E-4,2.3618382374676044E-4,2.3613634324334574E-4,2.3615869074724907E-4,2.361242206063244E-4,2.3619765851711923E-4,2.3608908917345194E-4,2.3612557243393606E-4,2.363695826263905E-4,2.3824510646673115E-4,2.3612596245232132E-4,2.3634958866039754E-4,2.363742122098565E-4,2.36266833577134E-4,2.3613727335022462E-4,2.36218513704816E-4,2.3632967894044436E-4,2.3614946409949685E-4,2.3614860071362613E-4,2.3636105227822538E-4,2.361722603925213E-4,2.3617261781877006E-4,2.363239125264053E-4,2.3614954928455483E-4,2.3637703746512065E-4,2.3620864479495762E-4,2.3612499332492973E-4,2.3623204230611893E-4,2.3630414373063954E-4,2.3617341885568218E-4,2.3629990819577762E-4,2.3641592555151707E-4,2.3663535618876846E-4,2.3620823661977866E-4,2.3613713012922497E-4,2.362222709002404E-4,2.361611120599412E-4,2.3608934115479157E-4,2.361493909678507E-4,2.3638605301314237E-4,2.362563803832486E-4,2.3630044668255485E-4,2.361010912949482E-4,2.3614945101465854E-4,2.361370413326481E-4,2.362169715801618E-4,2.3625793189828055E-4,2.3620989018287192E-4,2.3617245049795425E-4,2.3613762528140638E-4,2.3662143292745198E-4,2.3619704431003985E-4,2.3614939688950418E-4,2.3619577938738517E-4,2.3612523491289714E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276126E-4,2.3613795678840868E-4,2.3612510012659143E-4,2.3631400587089345E-4,2.3621914350507268E-4,2.3612500142009964E-4,2.3610099510202473E-4,2.360772525389538E-4,2.3629070374590536E-4,2.3613656901327567E-4,2.3624390791467605E-4,2.3631323951260914E-4,2.3620602879437978E-4,2.361497096615575E-4,2.3610130461469635E-4,2.361617036906907E-4,2.361011774476095E-4,2.361135676555683E-4,2.3610131129695174E-4,2.3625457404084343E-4,2.3618425711895646E-4,2.3612531658619864E-4,2.361

{"value":"Jennifer Cassi (Gina Philips from \"Dead and Breakfast\") returns back to the house she grew up in which she recently inherited from her deceased sister, unbeknownst to her grandmother (Fay Dunaway) who's still living in it. Jennifer decides to sell it as she's in dire need of the money much to Granny's chagrin. She also begins to have troublesome recurring nightmares of a mysterious raven. There was really no one to relate to in this film. Jennifer seemed cold, distant, unsentimental, and narcissistic, whereas the grandmother seemed spiteful, sad, and also narcissistic. The film is good and well-made, but with no one to empathize with I found it hard to care about what happened to them.<br /><br />My Grade:

My advise would be to take TWO not one but TWO hits of very strong acid and at least you'll get a visual thrill out of it!! Although at the end you may kill yourself for wasting your acid!!!! Being that this comment requires 10 lines of info, let me write something for those of you that will try to defend the movie. Unintelligble. Garbage. Schitzoid. Waste of talent. Movie is ice, with paper on destination with ringing clouds, on a sunny dive in the pudding.... Sounds like lion in a red light with seeing hair.

Please Mr. Stone, next time you want to criticize the fascism of tv shows using violence to get high rates, avoid doing the same with your movie ! Michael Haneke said quite cleverly about this film that it was denouncing media fascism with fascist cinematographic ways. How true...

And of course it was nice to see shots of the Castro district (although the castro to me really caters more to gay male than female). But other than that I can't really recommend this movie. The characters aren't really developed for me to care and when they finally started to get to the \"role playing\" I was already bored out of my mind. And the role playing scenes that I did see were a bit embarrassing to watch. The acting leaves something to be desired. Needless to say I didn't finish the movie. I'd skip this one.","finished_norm":["i","borrow","thi","movi","becaus","not","onli","becaus","it","gai","theme","but","the","think","of","role","plai","realli","intrigu","me","i","be","pleasantli","surpris","that","it","be","shoot","in","san","francisco","sinc","i","live","near","sf","and","of","cours","it","be","nice","to","see","shot","of","the","castro","district","although","the","castro","to","me","realli","cater","much","to","gai","male","than","femal","but","other","than","that","i","ca","not","realli","recommend","thi","movi","the","charact","be","not","realli","develop","for","me","to","care","and","when","thei","final","start","to","get","to","the","role","plai","i","be","alreadi","bore","out","of","my","mind","and","the","role","plai","scene","that","i","do","see","be","a","bite","embarrass","to","watch","the","act","leav","someth","to","be","desir","needless","to","sai","i","do","not","finish","the","movi","i","have","skip","thi","on"],"filtered":["borrow","thi","movi","becaus","onli","becaus","gai","theme","think","role","plai","realli","intrigu","pleasantli","surpris","shoot","san","francisco","sinc","live","near","sf","cours","nice","see","shot","castro","district","although","castro","realli","cater","much","gai","male","femal","ca","realli","recommend","thi","movi","charact","realli","develop","care","thei","final","start","get","role","plai","alreadi","bore","mind","role","plai","scene","see","bite","embarrass","watch","act","leav","someth","desir","needless","sai","finish","movi","skip","thi"],"filtered2":["borrow","becaus","onli","becaus","gai","theme","think","role","plai","realli","intrigu","pleasantli","surpris","shoot","san","francisco","sinc","live","near","sf","cours","nice","see","shot","castro","district","although","castro","realli","cater","gai","male","femal","ca","realli","recommend","charact","realli","develop","care","final","start","get","role","plai","alreadi","bore","mind","role","plai","scene","see","bite","embarrass","watch","act","leav","someth","desir","needless","finish","skip"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,10,11,12,13,19,21,22,40,53,71,74,81,108,116,117,128,154,156,162,199,205,237,238,262,298,320,326,330,422,441,534,555,556,573,640,649,931,1017,1182,1962,2203,2248,3407,4763,5467,5678,5993,6652],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,10,11,12,13,19,21,22,40,53,71,74,81,108,116,117,128,154,156,162,199,205,237,238,262,298,320,326,330,422,441,534,555,556,573,640,649,931,1017,1182,1962,2203,2248,3407,4763,5467,5678,5993,6652],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,4.527176627893589,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,2.5958480334723544,4.885490627496221,1.7003182735607676,1.9214926742550966,1.9486336368009016,1.949757232424728,2.138507503627933,2.2466628996789315,2.2797301185117202,7.0229706123476525,2.348499626138016,2.3451551414151686,2.3586007221245198,2.558331832813986,2.571852579609833,2.640097787510554,2.597304642813496,2.726701583487816,2.7819920465008363,2.938298364153555,2.942840385588056,2.9292757465539174,3.2090054908152035,3.293679367864308,3.4933926673701317,3.432149042129413,3.43462735814388,3.4623020803001006,7.9996838330726465,3.6375061693251913,3.9241755834625858,4.0536665665501035,4.327618446189983,4.8796870284900224,5.0768550934009715,5.243909178064138,5.907203395474402,6.137727054086234,6.342521466732247,6.2980697041614135,6.437831646536572,13.451027437976705]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.950611946162391E-4,1.9488834103030875E-4,1.9493646046718616E-4,1.9489727200317522E-4,1.9491571671815223E-4,1.9488726647479067E-4,1.949478791203451E-4,1.948582704281239E-4,1.948883822179673E-4,1.95089778242811E-4,1.966377588502799E-4,1.9488870412317797E-4,1.9507327604168846E-4,1.9509359931150228E-4,1.9500497338335586E-4,1.948980396753212E-4,1.949650921386098E-4,1.950568433737987E-4,1.949081014207696E-4,1.949073888174127E-4,1.9508273764260614E-4,1.9492691654791704E-4,1.9492721155291233E-4,1.95052084011686E-4,1.949081717290296E-4,1.9509593116155184E-4,1.9495694674437434E-4,1.9488790424509802E-4,1.9497625809236242E-4,1.9503576765685215E-4,1.9492787269599095E-4,1.950322718197492E-4,1.951280277962671E-4,1.9530913686235504E-4,1.9495660985328938E-4,1.9489792146657053E-4,1.949681931739208E-4,1.9491771517053734E-4,1.9485847840320733E-4,1.9490804106090238E-4,1.9510337222585782E-4,1.9499634574500081E-4,1.9503271626469338E-4,1.948681764879271E-4,1.949080906210797E-4,1.9489784817751068E-4,1.9496381933204365E-4,1.9499762630200042E-4,1.9495797463658164E-4,1.9492707345315985E-4,1.9489833014491313E-4,1.952976451723818E-4,1.9494737217896297E-4,1.9490804594839278E-4,1.9494632816358055E-4,1.9488810364191747E-4,0.9845966403807115,1.949185094406561E-4,1.94898

{"value":"I read Rice's novel with interest, and became quite enchanted with its characters and heartbreaking tale based on historical truths.<br /><br />However, I was simply APPALLED at this disastrous adaptation. The casting was based merely on physical appearance, and not acting talent (with the obvious exception of Peter Gallagher, who was neither blond-haired, or able to act his way out of a wet paper bag). The cast's embarrassingly clumsy and inconsistent attempts at affecting a French accent was hilarious, but not in an entertaining way.

{"value":"Yet another movie with an interesting premise and some wondrous special effects falling right into the trash can.<br /><br />Boring direction and performances (with the exception of the lovely Annabel Schofield who is much cuter as a brunette and probably deserves better material, and the ever earnest Charlton Heston) earn the rating of a real stinker.<br /><br />It's amazing to watch Heston perform up to his usual par and display how really bad this movie is. He even plays in a sub-plot that kept me interested just to see how it tied back into the main line of the movie. The way they ended up resolving it was that they didn't.

{"value":"Yet another British romantic comedy which audiences all over the world seem to have a ravenous appetite for. This feeble effort is an unintentional parody of the genre - all the classic clichéd scenes are here from ridiculously elaborate misunderstandings to running after departing trains to declare one's love. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures save for Love-Hewitt who manages to bring some cohesion to the film. Things threaten to spiral out of control in the plausibility department as the film progresses; our good-natured suspension of belief finally comes crashing down during the preposterous ending.

{"value":"As a Southern Baptist, it pains me that I must give a below average rating to an overtly Christian movie. There certainly aren't so many that I want to discourage film-makers from a genre that's woefully under-exploited. Still, I must honestly say that \"Love's Abiding Joy\" is a typically low budget, low key, self-consciously Christian film. The plot is predictable, the acting mediocre (I'm being kind), and the editing atrocious. As a TV movie it might have been slightly above average, but as a feature film it leaves much to be desired. Keep trying guys. You've got to have a movie about about real Christians inside you somewhere. Might I suggest you turn to G. K. Chesterton or C. S.

{"value":"The major flaw with the film is its uninspired script. It plods back and forth between vignettes of Bettie's story and re-creations of the Klaw short films. While the Klaw re-creations are well done, it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety. Page Richards, while not an amazing actress, does a decent job overall. And, at times, she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie. Also of note is some faithful attention to detail. Costumes and clothing well done, as is some of the set direction. The sets are generally sparse and feel stage-y, but do feel of the era.

{"value":"When I first watched Robotboy, I found it fresh and interesting, but then I noticed, that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself, what is good/bad. Episodes became predictable. And main characters are not interesting. Again we see a hyper-smart boy, beaten by his older brother, parents who don't understand their kid, and his friends: girl and fat boy. Also this show has no logic. A super-modern robot who works on two AA-size batteries, and can use a lot of weapons. But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super-activated modes. We see two different robots, and it declines main idea of the show: \"Robot must learn how to behave himself in human

{"value":"This movie is painfully slow and has no plot. It conveys the lives of a group of laid off boatworkers. One of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job. There may be some social commentary here, but, it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic light.<br /><br />I do not understand why it had a 7.8 when I decided to watch it. I watched the whole tedious thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payoff. No luck. The IMDb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes. Anything above 6.5 was worth watching.<br /><br />And my wife says Javier Barem does not even look good in this movie. He's not my type, so, my agreement does not mean much.<br /><br />Sigh.

{"value":"I went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because I liked Bruce Dern in Silent Running and Family Plot. To this day (sorry Jack Nicholson), it is still the dullest movie I've ever seen. It just went on and on with no discernible point and then - it just ended. The lights came up and I watched everyone looking around in confusion. Had the projectionist missed a reel? I've never had the urge to find out. All I remember about the movie is that it was a non-drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach. The most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the totally mystified audience afterwords. Fortunately, this was just an exception for Jack, Bruce, and Karen Black.","finished_norm":["i","go","to","see","thi","movi","at","our","colleg","theater","thirti","year","ago","becaus","i","like","bruce","dern","in","silent","run","and","famili","plot","to","thi","dai","sorri","jack","nicholson","it","be","still","the","dull","movi","i","have","ever","see","it","just","go","on","and","on","with","no","discern","point","and","then","it","just","end","the","light","come","up","and","i","watch","everyon","look","around","in","confus","have","the","projectionist","miss","a","reel","i","have","never","have","the","urg","to","find","out","all","i","rememb","about","the","movi","be","that","it","be","a","nondrama","about","some","annoi","colleg","basketbal","player","and","their","coach","the","much","enjoy","part","of","the","movi","be","watch","the","total","mystifi","audienc","afterword","fortun","thi","be","just","a","except","for","jack","bruce","and","karen","black"],"filtered":["go","see","thi","movi","colleg","theater","thirti","year","ago","becaus","like","bruce","dern","silent","run","famili","plot","thi","dai","sorri","jack","nicholson","still","dull","movi","ever","see","go","discern","point","end","light","come","watch","everyon","look","around","confus","projectionist","miss","reel","never","urg","find","rememb","movi","nondrama","annoi","colleg","basketbal","player","coach","much","enjoy","part","movi","watch","total","mystifi","audienc","afterword","fortun","thi","except","jack","bruce","karen","black"],"filtered2":["go","see","colleg","theater","thirti","year","ago","becaus","like","bruce","dern","silent","run","famili","plot","dai","sorri","jack","nicholson","still","dull","ever","see","go","discern","point","end","light","come","watch","everyon","look","around","confus","projectionist","miss","reel","never","urg","find","rememb","nondrama","annoi","colleg","basketbal","player","coach","enjoy","part","watch","total","mystifi","audienc","afterword","fortun","except","jack","bruce","karen","black"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,16,22,24,32,34,38,42,44,57,61,64,66,98,132,137,168,182,184,229,232,246,255,271,290,353,367,424,427,437,610,737,777,814,999,1225,1335,1465,2067,2605,2638,2869,2914,3086,3218,3741,7611,7802],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,16,22,24,32,34,38,42,44,57,61,64,66,98,132,137,168,182,184,229,232,246,255,271,290,353,367,424,427,437,610,737,777,814,999,1225,1335,1465,2067,2605,2638,2869,2914,3086,3218,3741,7611,7802],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.3114004109387893,1.9416538289407692,1.9218995441445863,1.1966138720291084,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.6219954307453837,1.604729392502474,1.834162586674748,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,1.929723173391612,2.0881990796736947,2.253494045787767,2.2939035841256437,2.4894767118610357,2.7365296724240786,2.496249838866882,2.8432628718938773,2.6102777977348763,2.673149229007135,2.6754694156628323,2.757740698455715,2.8612813773965557,3.0266839340212486,3.0791938792932125,3.212973749990824,3.233054746047873,3.1952392950510555,3.477726550625732,3.68099128126493,8.17291277874619,7.872791389594723,4.1302590120314875,4.470719289830655,9.867508499520596,4.506310234933358,4.956227105612356,5.185068678041204,5.339219357868463,5.878215858601149,5.695894301807195,5.7446844659766265,5.695894301807195,5.719991853386255,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612997E-4,2.1169300653874447E-4,2.117452751773489E-4,2.1170270760391557E-4,2.1172274275403071E-4,2.1169183932737045E-4,2.1175767842838516E-4,2.1166034303434351E-4,2.1169305127789731E-4,2.1191181310725417E-4,2.1359327166514604E-4,2.116934009400757E-4,2.1189388796841993E-4,2.119159636557948E-4,2.118196957667696E-4,2.1170354147024005E-4,2.1177637567609532E-4,2.1187603835847075E-4,2.11714470811286E-4,2.1171369676217512E-4,2.1190416541618488E-4,2.1173490831315602E-4,2.117352287555902E-4,2.1187086861014455E-4,2.1171454718202663E-4,2.119184965746199E-4,2.1176752792775885E-4,2.1169253209079146E-4,2.1178850443817656E-4,2.1185314534259413E-4,2.1173594690714984E-4,2.118493480694336E-4,2.1195336081055485E-4,2.1215008639459382E-4,2.1176716198751698E-4,2.1170341306868612E-4,2.1177974410483197E-4,2.1172491352726213E-4,2.1166056894252492E-4,2.1171440524675968E-4,2.1192657926066694E-4,2.118103241917793E-4,2.1184983083759706E-4,2.1167110326541532E-4,2.1171445908036964E-4,2.1170333346011978E-4,2.117749931190511E-4,2.1181171516755474E-4,2.1176864445217797E-4,2.1173507874789016E-4,2.11703856986196E-4,2.121376038089872E-4,2.117571277748943E-4,2.1171441055568442E-4,2.1175599373704466E-4,2.1169274868102964E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.117257762850267E-4,2.117041541913149E-4,2.1169262784141013E-4,2.1186198702179457E-4,2.117769

If this movie questions Japanese society and their values and roles, than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know. This is a totally sick movie!!!!!!!! I did not enjoy it because it made no sense. My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under. It was total disappointment.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","terribl","throughout","the","whole","movi","i","be","puzzl","and","do","not","see","ani","point","to","it","i","have","to","go","to","thi","site","and","read","the","review","to","final","understand","what","it","be","about","thi","movi","be","not","worth","watch","at","all","not","onli","be","it","sick","and","revolt","but","total","stupid","pleas","do","not","watch","unless","you","be","on","of","that","that","like","to","watch","bad","movi","if","thi","movi","question","japanes","societi","and","their","valu","and","role","than","thi","be","a","countri","that","i","would","not","like","to","visit","or","bother","to","know","thi","be","a","total","sick","movi","i","do","not","enjoi","it","becaus","it","make","no","sens","my","boyfriend","and","i","sit","there","wait","to","see","if","it","be","a","horror","becaus","that","be","what","it","be","list","under","it","be","total","disappoint"],"filtered":["thi","movi","terribl","throughout","whole","movi","puzzl","see","ani","point","go","thi","site","read","review","final","understand","thi","movi","worth","watch","onli","sick","revolt","total","stupid","pleas","watch","unless","like","watch","bad","movi","thi","movi","question","japanes","societi","valu","role","thi","countri","like","visit","bother","know","thi","total","sick","movi","enjoi","becaus","make","sens","boyfriend","sit","wait","see","horror","becaus","list","total","disappoint"],"filtered2":["terribl","throughout","whole","puzzl","see","ani","point","go","site","read","review","final","understand","worth","watch","onli","sick","revolt","total","stupid","pleas","watch","unless","like","watch","bad","question","japanes","societi","valu","role","countri","like","visit","bother","know","total","sick","enjoi","becaus","make","sens","boyfriend","sit","wait","see","horror","becaus","list","total","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,7,9,11,22,26,27,66,83,111,128,136,145,156,166,173,176,184,187,200,212,219,244,331,346,378,438,451,460,496,601,608,778,843,1049,1050,1167,1511,2483,2800],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,7,9,11,22,26,27,66,83,111,128,136,145,156,166,173,176,184,187,200,212,219,244,331,346,378,438,451,460,496,601,608,778,843,1049,1050,1167,1511,2483,2800],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.9708269144703846,2.8828493162168796,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,2.5958480334723544,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.929723173391612,2.292318797740072,2.1183455303375887,2.3409902041158843,2.346825985579986,2.34599021453259,2.3451551414151686,2.4423870329693536,2.4368824319140248,2.5040471493269134,7.488749516600645,2.4732161909892554,2.5308211829319704,2.5983793339432615,2.5792094178355414,2.634508058031767,2.932274249550174,3.023389038124396,3.130944944345658,3.1797351085150902,3.216957819005698,3.216957819005698,3.293679367864308,3.555828138310924,3.616452760127359,7.611885612799853,4.339813719283801,4.176068548062782,4.240607069200353,4.2574141875167335,4.581533656170946,5.322690055917252,5.322690055917252]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918362E-4,2.3612552253122077E-4,2.3618382374676047E-4,2.361363432433458E-4,2.361586907472491E-4,2.3612422060632443E-4,2.3619765851711928E-4,2.3608908917345197E-4,2.361255724339361E-4,2.3636958262639052E-4,2.3824510646674332E-4,2.3612596245232135E-4,2.3634958866039756E-4,2.3637421220985654E-4,2.3626683357713403E-4,2.3613727335022465E-4,2.3621851370481602E-4,2.363296789404444E-4,2.3614946409949688E-4,2.3614860071362616E-4,2.363610522782254E-4,2.3617226039252134E-4,2.361726178187701E-4,2.3632391252640533E-4,2.3614954928455486E-4,2.3637703746512068E-4,2.3620864479495765E-4,2.3612499332492976E-4,2.3623204230611896E-4,2.363041437306396E-4,2.361734188556822E-4,2.3629990819577765E-4,2.364159255515171E-4,2.366353561887685E-4,2.3620823661977871E-4,2.36137130129225E-4,2.3622227090024046E-4,2.3616111205994122E-4,2.360893411547916E-4,2.3614939096785076E-4,2.363860530131424E-4,2.3625638038324864E-4,2.3630044668255487E-4,2.3610109129494823E-4,2.3614945101465857E-4,2.3613704133264814E-4,2.3621697158016184E-4,2.3625793189828057E-4,2.3620989018287194E-4,2.3617245049795428E-4,2.361376252814064E-4,2.3662143292745204E-4,2.361970443100399E-4,2.3614939688950423E-4,2.361957793873852E-4,2.361252349128972E-4,0.9813373836545964,2.3616207439276129E-4,2.361379567884087E-4,2.3612510012659146E-4,2.3631400587089348E-4,2.3621914350507273E-4,2.3612500142009967E-4,2.3610099510202475E-4,2.3607725253895382E-4,2.3629070374590538E-4,2.361365690132757E-4,2.3624390791467608E-4,2.3631323951260917E-4,2.362060287943798E-4,2.3614970966155752E-4,2.3610130461469638E-4,2.3616170369069074E-4,2.3610117744760954E-4,2.3611356765556836E-4,2.3610131129695177E-4,2.362545

Looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen.<br /><br />I am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. All stories have got no link with each other, but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani trying to show some relation between them. I tried to find out a few lines I could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write. The movie is a poor copy of Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY.<br /><br />My suggestion.

{"value":"A scientist on an island is in deep sorrow about the loss of his son who died of kidney cancer. So he thinks: why not turn my dead son into a hammerhead shark. Well, who wouldn't? It's a little hard to cope with the fact that the hammerhead shark that's killing everybody is constantly being called \"Paul\". Also, William Forsythe's cast as a MacGyver-kick-ass-savingtheday- kinda hero lacks credibility. On the other hand there are a few hot chicks who make you actually look at the screen while shark Paul bites another one to death. As a matter of fact I find bad b-movies quite amusing. But for my taste it would have been a much better movie if it was made for say 1000000 bucks less.

{"value":"I watched this on the tube last night. The actor's involved first caught my attention. The first scenes were attention getters. Some funny some sad. Good character development. I felt that the latter third of the film diverged. If it was not for the early part of the movie I would have stopped watching. I kept watching wanting to how how it tied together.<br /><br />Unfortunately I feel that it never happened. I especially did not like the extend period that several of the character were talking yiddish (?). Was that the other shoe?<br /><br />Would I recommend? No, I think not. As other reviewers mention much of the slang is dated (60's jive) but it was not too distracting. The ending totally turned me off.","finished_norm":["i","watch","thi","on","the","tube","last","night","the","actor","involv","catch","my","attent","the","scene","be","attent","getter","some","funni","some","sad","good","charact","develop","i","feel","that","the","latter","of","the","film","diverg","if","it","be","not","for","the","earli","part","of","the","movi","i","would","have","stop","watch","i","keep","watch","want","to","how","how","it","tie","togetherbr","br","unfortun","i","feel","that","it","never","happen","i","especi","do","not","like","the","extend","period","that","sever","of","the","charact","be","talk","yiddish","be","that","the","other","shoebr","br","would","i","recommend","no","i","think","not","a","other","review","mention","much","of","the","slang","be","date","jive","but","it","be","not","too","distract","the","end","total","turn","me","off"],"filtered":["watch","thi","tube","last","night","actor","involv","catch","attent","scene","attent","getter","funni","sad","good","charact","develop","feel","latter","film","diverg","earli","part","movi","stop","watch","keep","watch","want","tie","togetherbr","br","unfortun","feel","never","happen","especi","like","extend","period","sever","charact","talk","yiddish","shoebr","br","recommend","think","review","mention","much","slang","date","jive","distract","end","total","turn"],"filtered2":["watch","tube","last","night","actor","involv","catch","attent","scene","attent","getter","funni","sad","good","charact","develop","feel","latter","diverg","earli","part","stop","watch","keep","watch","want","tie","togetherbr","unfortun","feel","never","happen","especi","like","extend","period","sever","charact","talk","yiddish","shoebr","recommend","think","review","mention","slang","date","jive","distract","end","total","turn"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,10,12,19,24,37,41,42,43,61,62,94,96,134,144,176,184,186,210,227,241,266,267,285,298,315,316,320,455,512,636,647,743,1175,1356,1460,2431,3431,4799],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,7,10,12,19,24,37,41,42,43,61,62,94,96,134,144,176,184,186,210,227,241,266,267,285,298,315,316,320,455,512,636,647,743,1175,1356,1460,2431,3431,4799],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,2.8828493162168796,2.247774048205673,1.066728610262888,1.312380678011735,1.3210361566119257,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.6219954307453837,3.321622407243643,1.8818517047392527,2.0226120445069267,2.08112281984698,2.0390708128715254,2.2443961816702407,2.2931108769894046,2.5040471493269134,2.496249838866882,2.571852579609833,2.687151791517189,2.6005321873043625,2.6627744961815836,2.747702973022204,2.7085302779237206,2.808171552082607,2.7819920465008363,2.854312708080462,2.878207028279898,2.938298364153555,3.2787058260741455,3.369778711402955,7.061861173378394,3.6746621462132825,3.7568101178222815,4.263079925052412,4.396611317676934,4.4919214974812585,5.129498826886393,5.649374286172302,6.0662680901040895]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.6148425534859354E-4,2.612525409305092E-4,2.613170462009934E-4,2.6126451311592587E-4,2.6128923870304415E-4,2.6125110046281385E-4,2.6133235318208836E-4,2.612122305600347E-4,2.61252596143563E-4,2.6152257239224757E-4,2.635976778853438E-4,2.612530276652938E-4,2.6150045079199473E-4,2.615276946273664E-4,2.614088894243554E-4,2.612655421990289E-4,2.6135542764993473E-4,2.614784224027244E-4,2.612790302124765E-4,2.612780749504188E-4,2.6151313429716464E-4,2.613042523460798E-4,2.613046478074204E-4,2.6147204236255076E-4,2.6127912446240176E-4,2.615308205288302E-4,2.6134450855169804E-4,2.612519554093562E-4,2.6137039588135566E-4,2.614501698937487E-4,2.6130553408572875E-4,2.614454836394505E-4,2.61573846844978E-4,2.618166279341436E-4,2.613440569410398E-4,2.6126538373733585E-4,2.6135958466286957E-4,2.612919176768646E-4,2.6121250935567074E-4,2.612789492986127E-4,2.6154079545573903E-4,2.613973238661975E-4,2.6144607942866165E-4,2.612255098731045E-4,2.612790157352306E-4,2.6126528549157623E-4,2.6135372142190814E-4,2.6139904048386777E-4,2.6134588646609526E-4,2.613044626813577E-4,2.612659315805514E-4,2.618012230454303E-4,2.6133167361488854E-4,2.612789558504119E-4,2.613302740869846E-4,2.612522227056217E-4,0.979351423393872,2.612929824151943E-4,2.6126629836447957E-4,2.6125207357619056E-4,2.614610815020015E-4,2.613561244696414E-4,2.612519643659641E-4,2.612254034439247E-4,2.6119913434406635E-4,2.61435299708924E-4,2.61264762910896E-4,2.613835241546232E-4,2.614602335926061E-4,2.613416141725106E-4,2.612793019057336E-4,2.6122574589302147E-4,2.6129257226530106E-4,2.612256051935994E-4,2.6123931389089393E-4,2.612257532863612E-4,2.613953253040002E-4,2.613175256899794E-4,2.61252313070091E-4,2.6127762025432335E-4]}}
