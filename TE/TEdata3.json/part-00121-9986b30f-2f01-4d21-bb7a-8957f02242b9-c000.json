{"value":"All of David Prior's movies are terrible on all counts: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother is usually cast as the male lead). But they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity. The plot of almost every David Prior \"film\" (as I like to refer to them) is basically the same. Manly all-American commandos team up to blow up Communist baddies. But unlike other Cold War-era garbage such as Red Dawn, Prior's movies are actually funny because of their over-the-top premises and acting. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or was is the other dude?) is being summoned by General Mitchell for a top-secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the movie is then delivered, something to the effect of \"this is my roommate, I trained him well\". WHAT. You trained your roommate? And apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding eviction.<br /><br />If you can find these gems on video used anywhere, BUY THEM. They are all funny and even funnier after a few beers. Watch them with a group of your friends for a true MST3K-style experience. So far my friends and I have managed to get a hold of Night Wars and Aerobicide aka \"Killer Workout\". But the one I recommend the most over them all is Final Sanction, with the freakish-looking Robert Z'dar.","finished_norm":["all","of","david","prior","movi","be","terribl","on","all","count","bad","write","bad","act","bad","cinematographi","no","budget","the","director","brother","be","usual","cast","a","the","male","lead","but","thei","all","have","incred","entertain","valu","becaus","of","their","unintent","hilar","the","plot","of","almost","everi","david","prior","film","a","i","like","to","refer","to","them","be","basic","the","same","manli","allamerican","commando","team","up","to","blow","up","communist","baddi","but","unlik","other","cold","warera","garbag","such","a","red","dawn","prior","movi","be","actual","funni","becaus","of","their","overthetop","premis","and","act","the","well","part","of","jungl","assault","be","the","scene","in","which","becker","or","be","be","the","other","dude","be","be","summon","by","gener","mitchel","for","a","topsecret","mission","in","south","america","the","funni","line","in","the","movi","be","then","deliv","someth","to","the","effect","of","thi","be","my","roommat","i","train","him","good","what","you","train","your","roommat","and","appar","thi","be","go","to","be","their","solut","to","avoid","evictionbr","br","if","you","can","find","thi","gem","on","video","us","anywher","bui","them","thei","be","all","funni","and","even","funni","after","a","few","beer","watch","them","with","a","group","of","your","friend","for","a","true","mstkstyl","experi","so","far","my","friend","and","i","have","manag","to","get","a","hold","of","night","war","and","aerobicid","aka","killer","workout","but","the","on","i","recommend","the","much","over","them","all","be","final","sanction","with","the","freakishlook","robert","z","dar"],"filtered":["david","prior","movi","terribl","count","bad","write","bad","act","bad","cinematographi","budget","director","brother","usual","cast","male","lead","thei","incred","entertain","valu","becaus","unintent","hilar","plot","almost","everi","david","prior","film","like","refer","basic","manli","allamerican","commando","team","blow","communist","baddi","unlik","cold","warera","garbag","red","dawn","prior","movi","actual","funni","becaus","overthetop","premis","act","well","part","jungl","assault","scene","becker","dude","summon","gener","mitchel","topsecret","mission","south","america","funni","line","movi","deliv","someth","effect","thi","roommat","train","good","train","roommat","appar","thi","go","solut","avoid","evictionbr","br","find","thi","gem","video","us","anywher","bui","thei","funni","even","funni","beer","watch","group","friend","true","mstkstyl","experi","far","friend","manag","get","hold","night","war","aerobicid","aka","killer","workout","recommend","much","final","sanction","freakishlook","robert","z","dar"],"filtered2":["david","prior","terribl","count","bad","write","bad","act","bad","cinematographi","budget","director","brother","usual","cast","male","lead","incred","entertain","valu","becaus","unintent","hilar","plot","almost","everi","david","prior","like","refer","basic","manli","allamerican","commando","team","blow","communist","baddi","unlik","cold","warera","garbag","red","dawn","prior","actual","funni","becaus","overthetop","premis","act","well","part","jungl","assault","scene","becker","dude","summon","gener","mitchel","topsecret","mission","south","america","funni","line","deliv","someth","effect","roommat","train","good","train","roommat","appar","go","solut","avoid","evictionbr","find","gem","video","us","anywher","bui","funni","even","funni","beer","watch","group","friend","true","mstkstyl","experi","far","friend","manag","get","hold","night","war","aerobicid","aka","killer","workout","recommend","final","sanction","freakishlook","robert","z","dar"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,7,9,19,20,21,22,32,38,52,53,56,58,61,62,65,85,92,101,106,107,131,156,157,161,166,195,210,225,240,252,256,265,286,298,304,308,314,333,335,345,347,381,410,414,451,484,517,539,615,629,649,675,702,713,715,723,754,779,809,884,1107,1292,1299,1418,1427,1633,1715,1921,1936,2030,2036,2074,2127,2438,2539,3264,3448,3465,3536,3645,4102,4326,4353,7011,7490,8186],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,5,6,7,9,19,20,21,22,32,38,52,53,56,58,61,62,65,85,92,101,106,107,131,156,157,161,166,195,210,225,240,252,256,265,286,298,304,308,314,333,335,345,347,381,410,414,451,484,517,539,615,629,649,675,702,713,715,723,754,779,809,884,1107,1292,1299,1418,1427,1633,1715,1921,1936,2030,2036,2074,2127,2438,2539,3264,3448,3465,3536,3645,4102,4326,4353,7011,7490,8186],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144

{"value":"This film was so amateurish I could hardly believe what I was seeing. It is shot on VIDEO! NOT film! I have not seen the likes of this since the early 70's, when late night networks showed movie of the week 'horror flicks' shot in......video. It looks like a bad soap opera, and that is paying it a compliment. Some of the actors give it their best shot. Michael Des Barres does okay with what he is given to do, which is to act like a sex addict out of control. I can't say that it is pleasant to watch.<br /><br />Nastassja Kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film, with very little variation in camera angles. I can't fault her for someone else's poor blocking, but she is totally unbelievable in her role. Her little girl voice works against her here. And I consider myself a Nastassja Kinski fan. She is certainly ageless and exotic, but she's outside her range with this.<br /><br />Alexandra Paul is pathetically overwrought. Every line she delivers is with three exclamation points. Someone must have directed her to scream at all costs.

{"value":"This film was so amateurish I could hardly believe what I was seeing. It is shot on VIDEO! NOT film! I have not seen the likes of this since the early 70's, when late night networks showed movie of the week 'horror flicks' shot in......video. It looks like a bad soap opera, and that is paying it a compliment. Some of the actors give it their best shot. Michael Des Barres does okay with what he is given to do, which is to act like a sex addict out of control. I can't say that it is pleasant to watch.<br /><br />Nastassja Kinski as the therapist sits in a chair for practically the entire film, with very little variation in camera angles. I can't fault her for someone else's poor blocking, but she is totally unbelievable in her role. Her little girl voice works against her here. And I consider myself a Nastassja Kinski fan. She is certainly ageless and exotic, but she's outside her range with this.<br /><br />Alexandra Paul is pathetically overwrought. Every line she delivers is with three exclamation points. Someone must have directed her to scream at all costs. Why would Michael Des Barres want to have sex with such a raging shrew?<br /><br />Finally, Rosanna Arquette as the sweet, maligned wife comes off okay, and probably the most believable of the bunch. But that is not saying much.<br /><br />This has to be the worst film I have seen in years.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","so","amateurish","i","can","hardli","believ","what","i","be","see","it","be","shoot","on","video","not","film","i","have","not","see","the","like","of","thi","sinc","the","earli","when","late","night","network","show","movi","of","the","week","horror","flick","shoot","invideo","it","look","like","a","bad","soap","opu","and","that","be","pai","it","a","complim","some","of","the","actor","give","it","their","well","shoot","michael","de","barr","doe","okai","with","what","he","be","give","to","do","which","be","to","act","like","a","sex","addict","out","of","control","i","ca","not","sai","that","it","be","pleasant","to","watchbr","br","nastassja","kinski","a","the","therapist","sit","in","a","chair","for","practic","the","entir","film","with","veri","littl","variat","in","camera","angl","i","ca","not","fault","her","for","someon","els","poor","block","but","she","be","total","unbeliev","in","her","role","her","littl","girl","voic","work","against","her","here","and","i","consid","myself","a","nastassja","kinski","fan","she","be","certainli","ageless","and","exot","but","she","outsid","her","rang","with","thisbr","br","alexandra","paul","be","pathet","overwrought","everi","line","she","deliv","be","with","three","exclam","point","someon","must","have","direct","her","to","scream","at","all","cost","why","would","michael","de","barr","want","to","have","sex","with","such","a","rage","shrewbr","br","final","rosanna","arquett","a","the","sweet","malign","wife","come","off","okai","and","probabl","the","much","believ","of","the","bunch","but","that","be","not","sai","muchbr","br","thi","have","to","be","the","wrong","film","i","have","see","in","year"],"filtered":["thi","film","amateurish","hardli","believ","see","shoot","video","film","see","like","thi","sinc","earli","late","night","network","show","movi","week","horror","flick","shoot","invideo","look","like","bad","soap","opu","pai","complim","actor","give","well","shoot","michael","de","barr","doe","okai","give","act","like","sex","addict","control","ca","sai","pleasant","watchbr","br","nastassja","kinski","therapist","sit","chair","practic","entir","film","veri","littl","variat","camera","angl","ca","fault","someon","els","poor","block","total","unbeliev","role","littl","girl","voic","work","consid","nastassja","kinski","fan","certainli","ageless","exot","outsid","rang","thisbr","br","alexandra","paul","pathet","overwrought","everi","line","deliv","three","exclam","point","someon","must","direct","scream","cost","michael","de","barr","want","sex","rage","shrewbr","br","final","rosanna","arquett","sweet","malign","wife","come","okai","probabl","much","believ","bunch","sai","muchbr","br","thi","wrong","film","see","year"],"filtered2":["amateurish","hardli","believ","see","shoot","video","see","like","sinc","earli","late","night","network","show","week","horror","flick","shoot","invideo","look","like","bad","soap","opu","pai","complim","actor","give","well","shoot","michael","de","barr","doe","okai","give","act","like","sex","addict","control","ca","pleasant","watchbr","nastassja","kinski","therapist","sit","chair","practic","entir","veri","littl","variat","camera","angl","ca","fault","someon","els","poor","block","total","unbeliev","role","littl","girl","voic","work","consid","nastassja","kinski","fan","certainli","ageless","exot","outsid","rang","thisbr","alexandra","paul","pathet","overwrought","everi","line","deliv","three","exclam","point","someon","must","direct","scream","cost","michael","de","barr","want","sex","rage","shrewbr","final","rosanna","arquett","sweet","malign","wife","come","okai","probabl","believ","bunch","muchbr","wrong","see","year"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,14,15,16,18,20,21,25,28,30,34,37,41,48,57,66,81,83,84,85,91,102,107,117,128,139,140,141,146,148,150,156,162,184,191,196,198,210,224,231,240,244,254,257,263,266,317,322,389,419,428,466,517,526,571,601,665,750,791,823,837,840,857,917,1188,1200,1269,1293,1298,1343,1388,1553,1792,2033,2206,2210,2312,2487,3030,3096,3184,3194,3795,3796,4362,4895,4995,6407,6429,6553,6777],"values":[3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,9,14,15,16,18,20,21,25,28,30,34,37,41,48,57,66,81,83,84,85,91,102,107,117,128,139,140,141,146,148,150,156,162,184,191,196,198,210,224,231,240,244,254,257,263,266,317,322,389,419,428,466,517,526,571,601,665,750,791,823,837,840,857,917,1188,1200,1269,1293,1298,1343,1388,1553,1792,2033,2206,2210,2312,2487,3030,3096,3184,3194,3795,3796,4362,4895,4995,6407,6429,6553,6777],"values":[1.9381148836729736,1.967100616408184,1.06835708567220

{"value":"No, not the administration of GWB, the Decider/Strutter/Smirker--but the mini-series \"Monarch Cove.\" Lifetime must have realized what a dog this was because the series was burned off two episodes at a time, most of them broadcast between 11 p.m. Friday nights and 1 a.m. Saturday mornings. As to why I watched the whole thing, I can only plead to weekly sudden convulsive attacks of masochism.<br /><br />Most of the cast are unknowns who are likely to remain unknown. The only two recognizable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who turn in the only decent performances (Jones doesn't make it through the entire series--lucky woman). Ward, by the way, is aging quite well since her \"Thorn Birds\" days.<br /><br />The one main thread to the plot--who murdered the father of the heroine who is wrongly convicted of Dad's murder but is freed after six years in the slammer--is stretched out for so long and concluded so hastily that you won't especially care who dun it. There is a great deal of \"steamy\" sex, several murders, and all sorts of rude behavior--virtually none of which is either interesting or credible.

{"value":"i saw this movie at the toronto film festival with fairly solid expectations. the movie has a great cast and was closing at the festival so it must be good, right? how wrong i was. <br /><br />i knew we were in trouble when before the film the director was talking about how when he was directing an episode of wiseguy he met an unknown actor named kevin spacey (a director/writer of wiseguy making his feature debut = blah)... well the director/writer of Edison must have some incriminating pictures of kevin spacey killing a homeless man, because i cannot see how he (along with the other actors in the film) would ever agree to be in this disaster. <br /><br />this movie is absolutely appalling! it's a mixture of every cop hard boiled cliché ever. there is nothing new with Edison. the acting was bad and the direction was even worse. it looked like that aforementioned episode of wiseguy. this was the best casted direct to video movie i've ever seen. <br /><br />some examples of just

{"value":"I rented this film yesterday mostly due to the good-looking art and the summary given on the back of the jacket. After popping it into my DVD player I re-examined the jacket cover and even though I took the cover out of from the plastic viewer, I STILL could not read any of the production detail information about the film. This film is entitled Evil on the Jacket and had to locate it by going to Faith Films website to find out any linkage to it here on IMDb.<br /><br />The filming and special affects done in the film looked quite good ... THEN, a line-reading actor spoke. Oh dear ... this actor's reading sounded like some pimple-faced high school jock whose voice just managed to change pitch, and no attempt given to go beyond reading the lines from the script. At first I thought I got a bad disc out of audio sync, then had to surmise it was a foreign film since I couldn't read the jacket... English dialog dubbed. If they'd casted the right person for dubbing the dialog, this film MIGHT have been decent. I gave it a chance of about 20 minutes before ejecting it when I discovered the bad line reader wasn't going to get killed off, but stay as the constant main fixture. Yes, it is THAT bad! The jacket cover art and the art done in the film are great, so gave the one star, but minus 1,999,999 stars for the rotten dialog.

{"value":"Millie is a sap. She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child. She then catches him cheating on her and divorces him...but lets him keep the kid she claims to love. Back then in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy...with no support...what a sap! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he turns out to ALSO be a cheat! Wow, does she have a hard time picking men.<br /><br />As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she's a wild party girl--doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and oddly fashions haven't changed one bit. An old friend of Millie's (yes, it's another evil man!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has lecherous designs on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she'll kill him. Take a wild guess what happens next! <br /><br />Overall, the film is a confusing and often bizarre mess--a bit like \"Madam X\" but much, much less focused. So often Millie's motivations and actions seem to make little sense. And, the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it--so long as it substantiates the notion that all men are pigs.

{"value":"Here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea. That is the problem isn't? The concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance. It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. This movie doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are not believable in the way they act and interact. Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop over chewing is gum, frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here. I mean what is that?, he looks like he's on the toilet or something. I loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. But not for this, he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner, it's not natural, I'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during filming. The movie is basically on life support, it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come.","finished_norm":["here","go","the","perfect","exampl","of","what","not","to","do","when","you","have","a","great","idea","that","be","the","problem","be","not","the","concept","be","fresh","and","full","of","potenti","but","the","script","and","the","execut","of","it","lack","ani","real","substanc","it","should","grab","you","from","the","start","and","then","pull","a","littl","on","your","emot","get","you","interest","and","invest","in","the","charact","thi","movi","doe","not","have","what","it","take","to","take","off","and","sustain","flight","and","here","be","why","you","do","not","realli","care","about","the","charact","becaus","thei","be","not","present","in","a","wai","that","peopl","can","relat","to","i","mean","thi","be","not","superman","or","mission","imposs","here","it","suppos","to","be","about","normal","peopl","put","in","a","stress","situat","thei","be","not","believ","in","the","wai","thei","act","and","interact","exampl","jeffrei","comb","a","a","cop","over","chew","be","gum","frown","and","look","intens","all","the","time","be","not","the","wai","to","go","here","i","mean","what","be","that","he","look","like","he","on","the","toilet","or","someth","i","love","him","in","reanim","and","the","wai","he","be","plai","the","intenseneurot","unappreci","medic","geniu","be","right","on","the","monei","but","not","for","thi","he","try","too","hard","to","over","compens","by","look","so","intens","and","on","edg","but","in","a","still","mild","neurot","manner","it","not","natur","i","be","surpris","he","do","not","disloc","hi","jaw","dure","film","the","movi","be","basic","on","life","support","it","bare","have","a","puls","and","it","keep","me","wait","for","someth","that","would","never","come"],"filtered":["go","perfect","exampl","great","idea","problem","concept","fresh","full","potenti","script","execut","lack","ani","real","substanc","grab","start","pull","littl","emot","get","interest","invest","charact","thi","movi","doe","take","take","sustain","flight","realli","care","charact","becaus","thei","present","wai","peopl","relat","mean","thi","superman","mission","imposs","suppos","normal","peopl","put","stress","situat","thei","believ","wai","thei","act","interact","exampl","jeffrei","comb","cop","chew","gum","frown","look","intens","time","wai","go","mean","look","like","toilet","someth","love","reanim","wai","plai","intenseneurot","unappreci","medic","geniu","right","monei","thi","try","hard","compens","look","intens","edg","still","mild","neurot","manner","natur","surpris","disloc","hi","jaw","dure","film","movi","basic","life","support","bare","puls","keep","wait","someth","never","come"],"filtered2":["go","perfect","exampl","great","idea","problem","concept","fresh","full","potenti","script","execut","lack","ani","real","substanc","grab","start","pull","littl","emot","get","interest","invest","charact","doe","take","take","sustain","flight","realli","care","charact","becaus","present","wai","peopl","relat","mean","superman","mission","imposs","suppos","normal","peopl","put","stress","situat","believ","wai","act","interact","exampl","jeffrei","comb","cop","chew","gum","frown","look","intens","time","wai","go","mean","look","like","toilet","someth","love","reanim","wai","plai","intenseneurot","unappreci","medic","geniu","right","monei","try","hard","compens","look","intens","edg","still","mild","neurot","manner","natur","surpris","disloc","jaw","dure","basic","life","support","bare","puls","keep","wait","someth","never","come"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,8,10,13,14,16,18,21,22,23,27,31,33,34,36,40,42,51,53,54,60,64,71,75,77,80,88,91,121,123,126,134,149,159,167,171,183,205,239,286,307,326,331,336,411,456,458,473,476,506,544,547,589,662,677,700,726,901,903,1046,1168,1341,1350,1439,1550,1552,1633,1658,1819,1891,1917,2091,2131,2155,2407,2500,2823,3170,3270,3914,3930,4086,4790,6692,6960],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,6,8,10,13,14,16,18,21,22,23,27,31,33,34,36,40,42,51,53,54,60,64,71,75,77,80,88,91,121,123,126,134,149,159,167,171,183,205,239,286,307,326,331,336,411,456,458,473,476,506,544,547,589,662,677,700,726,901,903,1046,1168,1341,1350,1439,1550,1552,1633,1658,1819,1891,1917,2091,2131,2155,2407,2500,2823,3170,3270,3914,3930,4086,4790,6692,6960],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,0.9418936859054116,2.247774048205673,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,3.589841616087325,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,2.729695454751562,1.3002700588679295,2.814133962290301,5.607414179074086,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.6284968758320737,1.

{"value":"Mmm, doesn't a big stack of pancakes sound good? Maple syrup and fruit preserves on top. Take a bite. Mmmmmmm. Take another bite. Another. Another. EAT. EAT it, you!!! Keep shoveling it down your throat until your face turns green with nausea. You have just had the Ally McBeal experience.<br /><br />I stumbled on this show in the winter of '98 and was instantly hooked. Like that stack of pancakes, I gorged myself on it. But the enjoyment soon wore off, because the Ally McBeal character (whom we see to be cute & endearing at first sight) soon becomes the most annoying, insecure, whining complainer you've ever met. (Call me a feminist, but I prefer my female leads to have a spine.) The gags & gimmicks of the show also become hackneyed, the music of Vonda Shepherd (which is really shoved in your face) becomes grating, and the incessant character changes & rewrites make the show into a damn soap opera.<br /><br />My advice to you is to take this show in small doses, and quit as soon as it becomes bothersome (and it will). I made it through 2.5 seasons before my enjoyment had totally soured. It was good while it lasted, but like a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend it just turned ugly after it had overstayed its welcome.<br /><br />And next time you go to IHOP, skip the pancakes. Order something healthy like the fruit cup.

{"value":"Ever wanted to eat worms? Here's a 'documentary' to show you how! Yeah...The kid eats live worms! And that's about the most interesting part of the movie.<br /><br />This movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring. I'm totally in agreement here. The movie just doesn't go anywhere....unless you're fond of worm eating! This is one movie it's almost impossible to write a spoiler for....because nothing much happens.<br /><br />Now on the technical side: They should have given that kid a haircut. Who's he trying to look like anyway...Bozo the Clown. It was almost comical...I almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something.<br /><br />And on top of that; the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry! Should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming.<br /><br />All in all, this movie nearly put me to sleep. And my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting.<br /><br />I will admit that the scenery was very impressive. And had there been a decent story to go with it, it might have made a hit.<br /><br />It did seem safe enough for kids to watch: The bear scenes and the 'oddball' eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids, and the brief 'skinny-dipping' scene didn't show anything.<br /><br />I gave this one a very generous

{"value":"I admit that the majority of this film was uninspired,but i was still entertained. It has a wonderful sense of frenetic energy,above average music,and the women in the film fiercely defend themselves,there's no prissies here. I can think of dozens of other films that were way worse,at least this one had an intriguing plotline along with some social commentary.They allude to how the military deals with viral epidemics,destroy everything in sight,even if it means the people you're supposed to be saving.Also, how dangerous martial law can be since at that point democracy ceases to exist. Fulci seemed to attempt to combine his earlier work(zombie,beyond,gates of hell)in an effort to somehow improve on them.He failed,but definitely not miserably,like a number of people would have you think.I have a soft spot for zombie films, so i admit that i'm somewhat biased when it comes to reviewing them.All i'm saying is that this movie is good for one time around,if there wasn't so much descension in the making of this film(fulci quit and bruno(i can hack with the best of them)mattei took over)it could have been much better and more focused.It's going to stay in my collection as

{"value":"Don't get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the shots are stunning, and the material is dramatic. However, it was a big disappointment and I actually left very angry at what Disney had done.<br /><br />BBC's Planet Earth was all of the above and more. It was subtle. It had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death. There was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. It was balanced.<br /><br />Disney's edit of Earth is none of this. They tried to make it a movie us Americans would talk about. They made it DRAMATIC. They put an over the top musical score there to frighten us. They made predators evil. They made WALRUSES evil. They showed every encounter as negative. It tried to be suspenseful and succeeded, but at the expense of the lesson of balance. The movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive.<br /><br />I am all for preventing global warning, but this was over the top political and environmental junk.<br /><br />That's another thing, I went to see it on the big screen, but was disappointed in the picture quality. It looked better on my TV at home.<br /><br />If you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, rent, or borrow the BBC's Planet Earth series.

{"value":"Let's start by the simple lines. From the viewer's side, there a couple of good \"director details\", some points of view at the movie scenes that are nice. The special effects are good enough, a good acting/good scenery also. But the story is way too simple. It shows how a elite Army bomb squad unit lives, acts and sometimes dies. It shows the drama of living in war. In my movie experience as a serious action movie \"addicted\" guy, I missed that click that gets my eyes and mind stuck on the screen. One of the things that need to be present in a movie in order to I consider it a good one is the ability of immerse the viewer in the movie reality and time. It didn't happened to me. I stayed \"conscious\", for the entire movie.<br /><br />Honestly speaking, I think that this movie gained its place in fame based on the \"subconscious\" appeal of American patriotism, a healthy and genuine feeling, but not the adequate use as a movie fame generator. More than a movie about war, it grows its popularity based on that.<br /><br />A simple thought: if this was a world war II or I movie, only changing time, with everything remained the same, would it be this awarded? Sure not. Why?

{"value":"I must admit I burst out laughing when I saw one reviewer compare this to LOTR. Well yes, if you exclude the dwarfs, the cast of thousands, the great special effects, the big battles, the strong characterization, the decent plot, the good acting, the classy direction and everything else. Which leaves you with the walking. And boy, does this film do walking! If Mr Piano had his way, this would probably be an uninterrupted three hours of hardcore walking through the Wisconsin countryside, but every 40 minutes or so these pesky Martians pop up for a few seconds to interrupt him before he goes for another bit of a ramble. You've never seen so much walking in a movie. If this really had a $20m budget, most of it must have gone on Mr Piano's shoes, because he had to get through plenty of pairs with all the walking he does. Which explains why there's no money left for decent effects, a decent video camera or proper actors. Honestly, it's like watching some bizarre fetish video for people with a thing about going for long walks in period costumes. Even on fast-forward, this is a looonnnggg walk.<br /><br />As for the sci-fi stuff, I think it was a mistake to put Martians in the film: they only get in the way of the walking, which is clearly much more interesting to the director than the story.<br /><br />I wonder how much Mr Piano charges to walk

{"value":"On a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk. He releases a few fellow inmates and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship. They dock onto a ludicrously enormous spacecraft that is orbiting a supernova star. This massive craft is populated by only three people, presumably because the budget of the film did not extend to hiring many actors. Anyway, to cut a long story short, the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse with the baddies.<br /><br />The psychopath in this movie is curious in that he is annoying. 'Annoying' is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic - unhinged, frightening, dangerous maybe but not 'annoying' but he is. The three people manning the giant ship are seriously unconvincing as warranting such important roles - this ship is practically the size of a city! Considering that the film is set approximately 50 years in the future, it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge man-made craft could exist, never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane task. Despite the vast size of the spaceship, the crew all have appallingly kitted out, tiny rooms and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs. But there are a lot of corridors.<br /><br />The film is fairly well acted and it works as an averagey sci-fi thriller.

{"value":"You like beautiful girls? Yeah me too. What is there bad to say about beautiful girls/women? Nothing imo, so why would I give this movie only 2 stars out of 5, although it got the \"talents\" of Chiaki Kuriyama and Aya Ueto? <br /><br />If I really wanted to watch beautiful people, I'd watch MTV or something that's why. This is a movie, a so called action movie nevertheless. So by definition it does not even really need a plot right? I'm not agreeing 100%, but let's say yes to that. So what does it need? 20 minutes footage from part 1 (I might be exaggerating a little bit, but it felt like more than 20 minutes ...)?! That would be \"No\". But then again you never know, the people who watched part one might not know what they ate this morning for breakfast, so hey let's remind them ... hey maybe remind them even twice? Just to be sure they won't forget ... at least until the credits roll, of course!!!! <br /><br />So forget about the story, about character development, about real emotions, about the \"acting\" (and no, I don't think women in skirts walking and/or fighting is accountable for acting!) ... what does that leave? Yes the action scenes. The action scenes are not bad and that's the reason I gave the movie 2 stars instead of 1! I was giving this movie a chance, but it was a waste of time ...

{"value":"OK, aside from the psychedelic background imagery, the info presented here was good. The music I could have done without (not that it was bad music, just that it didn't fit this film at all).<br /><br />As for the content of the film, the director brings up the often-lacking Pagan perspective on Christ's existence and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of Christ's life vs. the lives of mythological figures/deities such as Mithra and Dionyses. Then he brings up the chronology of Christianity's origins and presents an 'ok' case, but not one that blew me away.<br /><br />If the director had stuck with the facts and continued on with them, this film would have been good. However, at this point in the film, it disintegrates into a group of personally-gratifying attacks on Mel Gibson's \"Passion of the Christ\" and a Christian private school which the director attended in his youth. During an interview with his old principal, (which during the course of, it comes to light that the director set up under false pretenses) I felt that the director was acting sort of childish. He was asking good questions but, like the film itself, the interview crumbled into an attack on this particular private school's rules, not Christianity.<br /><br />All in all, if you're just

{"value":"I watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here. It was fairly easy to watch (at 3am). It had good casting - Kevin Dillon's role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable - he was both charasmatic and chilling. The rest of the main characters weren't so bad either.<br /><br />This is your typical stalker/suspense movie. A married couple cannot conceive so they go to a fertility clinic for help. A sociopathic \"genetic material\" donor fixates on the recipients and, in typical stalker form, intrudes into their lives.<br /><br />As I said, most of the movie was fairly good.. we see \"Conan\" grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother. Of course things don't work out for him the way he planned. Not a bad plot line.<br /><br />But, the last 15 minutes were just horrible. I am pretty tolerant with movies (especially at 3am!).. but, I was just amazed at how bad the ending was written. I actually scoffed outloud!<br /><br />All in all, not the worst movie I've seen, but I wouldn't be able to sit through it again (unless I skipped the ending). The only redeaming quality here was Kevin Dillon's role - - one of the best serial killers ever.<br /><br />Try looking around at the other channels before watching this..

{"value":"While \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is usually cited as one of the worse films ever made, this Mexican-made film from 1959 is so bad it makes \"SCCM\" look like \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" You have to wonder what the people who made this film were thinking; perhaps they meant it as a third-world allegory about capitalist greed and conspicuous consumption. Nah . . . They just weren't very good. The same production company made an even more disturbing version of \"Little Red Riding Hood\" in which the wolf's obsession with our heroine has unmistakable hints of pedophilia. (Perhaps this was the inspiration for \"Freeway.\") Back to \"Santa Claus\": instead of the North Pole, Jolly Old Saint Nicholas resides in a satellite in geosynchronous earth orbit (shades of \"MST3K\"); instead of elves his toys are made by children chosen from around the world; and he had sophisticated spy equipment to check just which kids are naughty and nice. The result is like an Orwellian outer space sweat shop. It's enough to turn you off Christmas forever. This and other low-rent Mexican children's' films were dubbed in English and widely distributed in the U.S. in the early 1960s; no wonder the sixties became such a turbulent period in American history.

{"value":"THE IMMORTALIZER was, uh, interesting. It certainly didn't kill me during its hour and a half duration, but it didn't impress me much either. A group of kids are abducted in an alley by musclehead mutants (in a scene featuring cinema's least convincing head crushing sound effect) and taken to a fancy house in the suburbs. Here Dr. Divine and his team are performing brain transplants for his rich old patients so they can have young bodies again. Hey, this was quietly remade with a big budget a few years later as FREEJACK! Who knew that when you transplant an old person's brain into a different body that their new voice will sound exactly like their old voice? With all this talk of pineal glands and the use of a glowing green serum, you can almost see visions of FROM BEYOND and RE-ANIMATOR dancing in the producers' heads. But the production literally doesn't have the guts to pull it off. I've never understood why, when someone is making a low budget horror film, that they don't pack it to the edge of the frame with gore. The acting is uniformly terrible, with the only good performance coming from Clarke Lindsley as the assistant Dr. Price. He has a nice evil laugh. The only other thing of note about THE IMMORTALIZER is that it features lots of old people doing their own stunts. Seriously, most of the cast takes some serious bumps for old

{"value":"After a series of power-outages on a remote island zoo, genetically engineered sabertooth tigers are on the loose and mauling residents of the island. Man, the sci-fi channel has made some bad \"original\" movies, but I think this might possibly be their worst so far! This badly written and directed \"Jurassic Park\" rip-off offers all the usual clichés (mad scientists who thinks people killed by the monsters are \"expendable losses\", characters walking down long dark hallways alone, brain-dead teen characters who's only function in the film is to die a horrible death, etc.), and, unsurprisingly, no suspense whatsoever. The special effects are atrociousthe puppet heads in close-ups of the title beasties are bad enough, looking like stiff plush dolls, but the CGIwhich makes the computer-generated dinosaurs in \"Walking with Dinosaurs\" look life-like by comparisonare just downright awful. There's some gore, but most of it looks pretty unconvincing. Oh, and the death scene of the scientist at the end is truly one of the worst things I've seen in years. I couldn't even laugh it was so bad!<br /><br />Don't waste your time, this one is just downright bad.<br /><br />2/10. <br /><br />Oh, and here's some interesting trivia for youthis film borrowed music cues from the 2003 sci-fi film \"Alien Hunter\", which was far superior to this piece of

{"value":"This is a case of a bunch of people thinking they are so clever they have a story that fits the time. Remember the all-around political conspiracies caught on camera in the years leading to the Watergate and a little later? Most movies trying to cash in on made-for-TV 'o so powerful, o so mind numbing' conspiracies were in fact caught in their own navel-gazing attitude.<br /><br />I was never a fan of The Conversation which I find as much dated as others conspiracy stints of the time but Coppola was true to his main character and Hackman was a pretty engaging actor to observe. I mean these conspiracy movies are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir heroes. Lots of questions unanswered, lots of dis-communication... Well this takes at least Bergman to build a movie about such un-visual bases.<br /><br />The Next Man is a perfect example of its time: one political soup served with an idealistic character and an horrendous conspiracy tightening its web around him. Neither part is interesting in itself and the whole doesn't get any better. In fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequences piling up 'watcha that' murders without ever advancing any storyline. Pedestrian directing at its worst as most of the movie is one pompous accumulation of scenes revolving around violence naively brought under the viewer's eyes.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","case","of","a","bunch","of","peopl","think","thei","be","so","clever","thei","have","a","stori","that","fit","the","time","rememb","the","allaround","polit","conspiraci","catch","on","camera","in","the","year","lead","to","the","waterg","and","a","littl","late","much","movi","try","to","cash","in","on","madefortv","o","so","power","o","so","mind","numb","conspiraci","be","in","fact","catch","in","their","own","navelgaz","attitudebr","br","i","be","never","a","fan","of","the","convers","which","i","find","a","much","date","a","other","conspiraci","stint","of","the","time","but","coppola","be","true","to","hi","main","charact","and","hackman","be","a","pretti","engag","actor","to","observ","i","mean","thi","conspiraci","movi","be","mostli","drown","in","the","charact","pool","of","noir","hero","lot","of","question","unansw","lot","of","discommun","good","thi","take","at","littl","bergman","to","build","a","movi","about","such","unvisu","basesbr","br","the","next","man","be","a","perfect","exampl","of","it","time","on","polit","soup","serv","with","a","idealist","charact","and","a","horrend","conspiraci","tighten","it","web","around","him","neither","part","be","interest","in","itself","and","the","whole","doe","not","get","ani","well","in","fact","you","can","tell","how","much","it","will","be","bad","from","the","veri","sequenc","pile","up","watcha","that","murder","without","ever","advanc","ani","storylin","pedestrian","direct","at","it","wrong","a","much","of","the","movi","be","on","pompou","accumul","of","scene","revolv","around","violenc","naiv","bring","under","the","viewer","ey"],"filtered":["thi","case","bunch","peopl","think","thei","clever","thei","stori","fit","time","rememb","allaround","polit","conspiraci","catch","camera","year","lead","waterg","littl","late","much","movi","try","cash","madefortv","o","power","o","mind","numb","conspiraci","fact","catch","navelgaz","attitudebr","br","never","fan","convers","find","much","date","conspiraci","stint","time","coppola","true","hi","main","charact","hackman","pretti","engag","actor","observ","mean","thi","conspiraci","movi","mostli","drown","charact","pool","noir","hero","lot","question","unansw","lot","discommun","good","thi","take","littl","bergman","build","movi","unvisu","basesbr","br","next","man","perfect","exampl","time","polit","soup","serv","idealist","charact","horrend","conspiraci","tighten","web","around","neither","part","interest","whole","doe","get","ani","well","fact","tell","much","bad","veri","sequenc","pile","watcha","murder","without","ever","advanc","ani","storylin","pedestrian","direct","wrong","much","movi","pompou","accumul","scene","revolv","around","violenc","naiv","bring","viewer","ey"],"filtered2":["case","bunch","peopl","think","clever","stori","fit","time","rememb","allaround","polit","conspiraci","catch","camera","year","lead","waterg","littl","late","try","cash","madefortv","o","power","o","mind","numb","conspiraci","fact","catch","navelgaz","attitudebr","never","fan","convers","find","date","conspiraci","stint","time","coppola","true","main","charact","hackman","pretti","engag","actor","observ","mean","conspiraci","mostli","drown","charact","pool","noir","hero","lot","question","unansw","lot","discommun","good","take","littl","bergman","build","unvisu","basesbr","next","man","perfect","exampl","time","polit","soup","serv","idealist","charact","horrend","conspiraci","tighten","web","around","neither","part","interest","whole","doe","get","ani","well","fact","tell","bad","veri","sequenc","pile","watcha","murder","without","ever","advanc","ani","storylin","pedestrian","direct","wrong","pompou","accumul","scene","revolv","around","violenc","naiv","bring","viewer","ey"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,9,10,12,14,15,17,18,19,20,23,25,27,31,36,38,41,42,44,45,57,60,61,72,78,88,90,97,98,102,111,125,140,150,157,179,231,238,250,273,279,281,288,290,297,304,307,349,366,375,378,419,452,477,510,512,515,516,575,647,676,677,718,815,943,955,994,1131,1305,1453,1506,1686,1763,1855,2013,2130,2357,2362,2534,2642,2774,3213,3657,3744,4227,4584,5409,5458,6723],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,8,9,10,12,14,15,17,18,19,20,23,25,27,31,36,38,41,42,44,45,57,60,61,72,78,88,90,97,98,102,111,125,140,150,157,179,231,238,250,273,279,281,288,290,297,304,307,349,366,375,378,419,452,477,510,512,515,516,575,647,676,677,718,815,943,955,994,1131,1305,1453,1506,1686,1763,1855,2013,2130,2357,2362,2534,2642,2774,3213,3657,3744,4227,4584,5409,5458,6723],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,2.825681057716235,

{"value":"...was so that I could, in good conscience, tell everyone how horrible this movie is. I barely made it through twenty minutes before I started thinking to myself,\"Wow, this is pretty bad.\". And, to be honest, I would've given this movie 1 star if it wasn't for Esai Morales (though he had very little screen time). He's the movie's only well-acted role, which is a shame because I really like Gil Bellows...or at least I thought I did.<br /><br />While watching this I started thinking back to his part in \"Shawshank Redemption\" and realized it wasn't as good as I thought it was. Problem: his jail-house/tough guy act seems like it's just that, an act; his dialogue sounded like he was doing a very poor impression. Has he ever met someone who speaks like his character was SUPPOSED to? I doubt it, but maybe he should have.<br /><br />And, to make matters worse, they've managed to inject a little jail-house philosophy and make it seem nothing short of contrived, especially when you consider that the rhetoric was being spouted by a \"rasta\" who's accent was so strong that it seemed unnatural.<br /><br />I wouldn't normally slam a movie like this, but when I saw the movie it had a fairly favorable review. I felt like I was cheated and lied to, and I thought I should try to save someone the misery of having to watch this movie.<br /><br />I say

{"value":"It seems that several of the people who have reviewed this movie only watched it in the first place because it was filmed near where they live. How's that for a ringing endorsement? If this movie was filmed near where I lived I wouldn't be mentioning it in my review. It is horrid! Several reviews state that this film is a spoof or tongue-in-cheek horror movie, it is neither. It is sad to see this film reviewed as a comedy as that makes it not only a bad attempt at a horror film but as a comedy as well. I did laugh though, at how unbelievably bad the film was.<br /><br />This movie has 2 good things going for it, the mask and the weapon of choice, unfortunately it would have been more interesting watching an hour and a half of the mask and weapon laying on a table then watching this garbage. The social commentary behind the film is also laughable, juvenile and stupid. Don't bother with this movie, you've already wasted time reading this review don't waste anymore on this movie. Arrggghhh! It's infuriating that movies like this even get made. I was expecting the entire cast a crew to be credited to Alan Smithee, a name used when a person, usually a director, doesn't want to be credited with a movie because it's so bad.<br /><br />There is nothing redeeming in this movie, I spent $1.19 on the rental and feel I was ripped off.

{"value":"I don't think I've ever felt this let down by a film before. After loving Guy Ritchie's two previous films (I don't count Swept Away - he was pussy blind), I was so looking forward to seeing this. <br /><br />The reviews were poor, then again, I don't trust the press anyway. More worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker, so it was with some trepidation I handed over my £4.80 yesterday afternoon.<br /><br />I'm not even going to try to explain this film, mainly because I haven't got a clue what was going on and at one point I was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who didn't get it! <br /><br />Unfortunately I think Ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking himself far too seriously.It seems it wasn't good enough for him to make films with good plots, laughs, snappy dialogue and good characters. It's almost as if he had a checklist of films he wanted to rip off, here are some of the ones I noticed:<br /><br />The Matrix, Fight Club, Kill Bill, The Usual Suspects, Vanilla Sky...<br /><br />I think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors, Jason Statham and Ray Liotta, were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing /

{"value":"This is a classic stinker with a big named cast, mostly seniors who were well past their prime and bedtime in this one.<br /><br />This is quite a depressing film when you think about it. Remain on earth, and you will face illness and eventually your demise.<br /><br />Gwen Verndon showed that she could still dance. Too bad the movie didn't concentrate more on that. Maureen Stapleton, looking haggard, still displayed those steps from \"Queen of the Star Dust Ballroom,\" so much more down to earth from 10 years earlier.<br /><br />I only hope that this film doesn't encourage seniors to commit mass suicide on the level of Jim Jones. How can anyone be idiotic enough to like this and say it gets you to think?<br /><br />Why did Don Ameche win an Oscar for this nonsense?<br /><br />If the seniors were doing such a wonderful thing at the end, why was the youngster encouraged to get off the boat? Why did Steve Guttenberg jump ship as well? After all, he had found his lady-love. <br /><br />This would have been a nice film if the seniors had just managed to find their fountain of youth on earth and stay there.<br /><br />Sadly, with the exception of Wilford Brimley, at this writing, Vernon, Gilford, Stapleton, Ameche, Tandy, Cronyn and lord knows who else are all gone. The writers should have taken the screenplay and placed it with this group as well.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","classic","stinker","with","a","big","name","cast","mostli","senior","who","be","good","past","their","prime","and","bedtim","in","thi","onebr","br","thi","be","quit","a","depress","film","when","you","think","about","it","remain","on","earth","and","you","will","face","ill","and","eventu","your","demisebr","br","gwen","verndon","show","that","she","can","still","danc","too","bad","the","movi","do","not","concentr","much","on","that","maureen","stapleton","look","haggard","still","displai","that","step","from","queen","of","the","star","dust","ballroom","so","much","much","down","to","earth","from","year","earlierbr","br","i","onli","hope","that","thi","film","doe","not","encourag","senior","to","commit","mass","suicid","on","the","level","of","jim","jone","how","can","anyon","be","idiot","enough","to","like","thi","and","sai","it","get","you","to","thinkbr","br","why","do","don","amech","win","a","oscar","for","thi","nonsensebr","br","if","the","senior","be","do","such","a","wonder","thing","at","the","end","why","be","the","youngster","encourag","to","get","off","the","boat","why","do","steve","guttenberg","jump","ship","a","good","after","all","he","have","find","hi","ladylov","br","br","thi","would","have","be","a","nice","film","if","the","senior","have","just","manag","to","find","their","fountain","of","youth","on","earth","and","stai","therebr","br","sadli","with","the","except","of","wilford","brimlei","at","thi","write","vernon","gilford","stapleton","amech","tandi","cronyn","and","lord","know","who","els","be","all","go","the","writer","should","have","take","the","screenplai","and","place","it","with","thi","group","a","good"],"filtered":["thi","classic","stinker","big","name","cast","mostli","senior","good","past","prime","bedtim","thi","onebr","br","thi","quit","depress","film","think","remain","earth","face","ill","eventu","demisebr","br","gwen","verndon","show","still","danc","bad","movi","concentr","much","maureen","stapleton","look","haggard","still","displai","step","queen","star","dust","ballroom","much","much","earth","year","earlierbr","br","onli","hope","thi","film","doe","encourag","senior","commit","mass","suicid","level","jim","jone","anyon","idiot","enough","like","thi","sai","get","thinkbr","br","amech","win","oscar","thi","nonsensebr","br","senior","wonder","thing","end","youngster","encourag","get","boat","steve","guttenberg","jump","ship","good","find","hi","ladylov","br","br","thi","nice","film","senior","manag","find","fountain","youth","earth","stai","therebr","br","sadli","except","wilford","brimlei","thi","write","vernon","gilford","stapleton","amech","tandi","cronyn","lord","know","els","go","writer","take","screenplai","place","thi","group","good"],"filtered2":["classic","stinker","big","name","cast","mostli","senior","good","past","prime","bedtim","onebr","quit","depress","think","remain","earth","face","ill","eventu","demisebr","gwen","verndon","show","still","danc","bad","concentr","maureen","stapleton","look","haggard","still","displai","step","queen","star","dust","ballroom","earth","year","earlierbr","onli","hope","doe","encourag","senior","commit","mass","suicid","level","jim","jone","anyon","idiot","enough","like","get","thinkbr","amech","win","oscar","nonsensebr","senior","wonder","thing","end","youngster","encourag","get","boat","steve","guttenberg","jump","ship","good","find","ladylov","nice","senior","manag","find","fountain","youth","earth","stai","therebr","sadli","except","wilford","brimlei","write","vernon","gilford","stapleton","amech","tandi","cronyn","lord","know","els","go","writer","take","screenplai","place","group","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,9,11,12,16,18,24,26,28,29,31,38,57,64,65,82,92,93,100,120,143,158,164,175,181,196,233,251,262,287,332,345,365,410,440,445,489,492,510,522,674,682,703,705,706,716,969,979,986,1060,1062,1075,1105,1195,1358,1372,1446,1450,1469,1489,1587,1640,1829,1929,2191,2256,2271,2506,2818,4331,5286,6563,7134,7370,8177,8347],"values":[1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,9,11,12,16,18,24,26,28,29,31,38,57,64,65,82,92,93,100,120,143,158,164,175,181,196,233,251,262,287,332,345,365,410,440,445,489,492,510,522,674,682,703,705,706,716,969,979,986,1060,1062,1075,1105,1195,1358,1372,1446,1450,1469,1489,1587,1640,1829,1929,2191,2256,2271,2506,2818,4331,5286,6563,7134,7370,8177,8347],"values":[0.6460382945576578,2.0358433949768115,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.2153159934048174,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,

{"value":"Heather Graham couldn't play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it. Who do the producers of the movie think they are? the ABSOLUTE WORST, most UNREALISTIC movie i've seen in as long as i can remember. This movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign-up on IMDb and make sure the rating of this \"film\" drops.<br /><br />omg i'm Heather Graham, i just kissed a drunk chick, so while she's passed out i'm REALLY going to pace around my room for HOURS asking myself frantically \"WHAT HAVE I DONE?!\".. Jesus heather, get over it and grow up... and i'd like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers... and while i'm at it, instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story, perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who's mentally unstable... like your so-called \"lesbian\" character... after all, i know the first time i had gay sex, when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street... honestly b*tch, get a grip... <br /><br />WHAT A JOKE! and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick, but i'm so sick of even thinking about it anymore. bottom line, if you're a smart person you'll hate this movie, and if you're not a

{"value":"A woman (Sylvia Kristel) seduces a 15 year old boy (Eric Brown). They have sex...but it's all tied into some stupid plot or something.<br /><br />Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever. Does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation? I suppose it's OK cause it's a teenage boy--if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would (rightfully) be outrage. Sorry, but having it done to a boy doesn't excuse it. It's still sick. I realize Brown was of age (he was actually 18 when this was made) but he LOOKS 15. I just find it disturbing that some people find this OK.<br /><br />Plot aside the acting sucks (Kristel is beautiful--but can't act; Brown is easily one of the worst child actors I've ever seen) and the constant nudity gets boring and isn't even remotely erotic.<br /><br />I saw this drivel at a theatre back in 1981. I was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin (who could easily pass for 18). HE wanted to see it--I didn't but I decideD what the heck? We got in and I actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage. My cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through! Let me make this clear--three TEENAGE BOYS left a movie with tons of female nudity! That should give you an idea of how bad this is. I'm surprised this was ever released.

{"value":"I watched Peter Jackson version of Lord of the Rings when I was half way through reading the Two Towers and I thought it was absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />At this time the animated version of the Lord of the Rings was released on DvD but I told myself that I will finish reading the Two Towers and Return of Kings before watching it (as I thought it showed the whole of the trilogy).<br /><br />So when I did finish the trilogy I went and brought the DvD, which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish.<br /><br />I was acturly bored 20 minutes in to it which was really strange because I love the book and I am shooked that the maker of this film could of even thought of fitting at least 1 and a half of the books in to a 2 hour 8 minute film.<br /><br />None of the characters had any emotions when they were talking and they seemed to be reading it of a page, even my favourite character who is Gandalf did not seem interesting at all. <br /><br />The animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the orks (they looked awful) and Aragorn and Sam face.<br /><br />I don't know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending, but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film couldn't of got any better. <br /><br />I just hope that nobody judges the books by this film.<br /><br

{"value":"As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the worst movies I've ever seen, and warn my friends and co-workers of it. Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what is the worst movie, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the worst movie ever, then he'd watch it. I lost. I believe that even I made better videos than this in high school, and those were hardly great feats of a young genius. This film not only lacked in what seemed to be production value (it looks like it was shot on a bad camcorder, although it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (wooden, hollow, and pathetic don't scratch the surface), as well as just generally bad movie feeling. I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash, suddenly, I was reminded of some bad high school plays (I know that I reference high school too often here, but this film did seem very juvenile) both in terms of the set, which seemed far too fake, but also as if the people were reading their lines from the script, not entirely sure what was actually going on. My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't describe how utterly horrid the time I spent watching this was. It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing a pathetic excuse for a

{"value":"This movie should not be viewed unless you are trying to kill yourself. I think this movie could actually cause severe brain damage. The main characters are the whiny non-hero Kevin, Amy, his bratty, ungodly conservative girlfriend, Kyle, a dork in red shorts who enjoys phone sex, Daphne, a scrawny, horny girl who is supposed to be \"cool\" and has no sense of how to dress, and her oversexed boyfriend Nick, an army recruit who can make an innuendo out of anything. No, I'm not a pervert, that's REALLY how the movie goes. The movie itself is an over-sexed rip-off of 1986's Gremlins, only you'll never find a trace of Gizmo anywhere. No, these Hobgoblins, unleashed by Wimpy Man (I'm sorry, Kevin), make someone's wildest dreams come true, and then kill the victims. Yes, you guessed it-Eventually, they wind up in a strip club, where the nerdy Amy's greatest dream is revealed-She wants to be a stripper! Look, I watched this flick via MST3K, and even with Mike Nelson, Tom Servo, and Crow T. Robot making a laughing-stock out of this cinematic trainwreck and it still made me bleed from both eyes. Not really, but I wish I had. I'm not giving you anymore plot, because reliving it gives me this great urge to drive a pitchfork through my brain.

{"value":"\"A Christmas Story\" is one of many people's all-time most beloved films. ACS was able to take the viewer to a time and a place in such a way that very few films ever have. It had a sweetness and goodwill to it that is rare.<br /><br />So I awaited (and awaited) its sequel, \"It Runs In The Family\" . The film was almost released a couple of times, only to be pulled at the last minute. When it finally came out, IRITF was (and is, I guess) a total failure.<br /><br />The sets and cinematography were just fine, but the directing totally, completely missed the mark. The film was nothing more than a cash-flow formula of lazy casting, lazy writing, and disconnected acting.<br /><br />The narrator, Jean Shepard, who was one of America's great humorists and story-tellers, forced upon us a false reprise of the warm wit he used in ACS. He over-emoted, and why he did that I'll never know. He somehow managed to become an annoying, overwrought parody of himself.<br /><br />The writing and acting in IRITF is inauthentic and forced. The actors may have seen ACS, but whatever wit and nuance that was in ACS mustn't have registered at all on any of them. The acting was embarrassingly slapstick and bereft of any of Shepard's dry humor.<br /><br />ACS will always be a real treasure, but to call IRITF a sequel is to insult all of the fans of Jean Shepard and
