{"value":"This whirling movie looks more like a combination of music-clips at MTV than as a real movie. There is no real story and as the movie goes on you ask yourself: \"What is going to happen?\"; but nothing happens. The story around Eric Cloeck, the frustrated writer, is the only good thing. The other persons seem to have nothing in common: then why bring them together in a movie. With music you can make watchable the worst movie. When I open the tap and there comes water out with the music of Bach then most people will like to look at it but this is not a movie. The director should learn how to write a script for a movie of 100 minutes or more before starting to direct a movie.","finished_norm":["thi","whirl","movi","look","much","like","a","combin","of","musicclip","at","mtv","than","a","a","real","movi","there","be","no","real","stori","and","a","the","movi","go","on","you","ask","yourself","what","be","go","to","happen","but","noth","happen","the","stori","around","eric","cloeck","the","frustrat","writer","be","the","onli","good","thing","the","other","person","seem","to","have","noth","in","common","then","why","bring","them","togeth","in","a","movi","with","music","you","can","make","watchabl","the","wrong","movi","when","i","open","the","tap","and","there","come","water","out","with","the","music","of","bach","then","much","peopl","will","like","to","look","at","it","but","thi","be","not","a","movi","the","director","should","learn","how","to","write","a","script","for","a","movi","of","minut","or","much","befor","start","to","direct","a","movi"],"filtered":["thi","whirl","movi","look","much","like","combin","musicclip","mtv","real","movi","real","stori","movi","go","ask","go","happen","noth","happen","stori","around","eric","cloeck","frustrat","writer","onli","good","thing","person","seem","noth","common","bring","togeth","movi","music","make","watchabl","wrong","movi","open","tap","come","water","music","bach","much","peopl","like","look","thi","movi","director","learn","write","script","movi","minut","much","befor","start","direct","movi"],"filtered2":["whirl","look","like","combin","musicclip","mtv","real","real","stori","go","ask","go","happen","noth","happen","stori","around","eric","cloeck","frustrat","writer","onli","good","thing","person","seem","noth","common","bring","togeth","music","make","watchabl","wrong","open","tap","come","water","music","bach","peopl","like","look","director","learn","write","script","minut","befor","start","direct"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,11,16,17,23,25,29,34,35,49,58,59,65,71,77,79,80,94,98,102,118,153,242,250,270,287,306,431,830,939,968,1178,1366,1991,3070,3213,5979],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,11,16,17,23,25,29,34,35,49,58,59,65,71,77,79,80,94,98,102,118,153,242,250,270,287,306,431,830,939,968,1178,1366,1991,3070,3213,5979],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,0.9913098153388195,2.393227744058217,2.5541073880211935,1.364847727375781,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,3.3840606616174704,1.865701314626681,1.8693254449200722,1.9073850067444174,1.9214926742550966,1.9463902258768238,1.9469506069506084,3.9903607800925114,4.16224563969396,2.0881990796736947,2.087553710177271,4.70875905096179,2.3409902041158843,2.689504733779216,2.6812935439488212,2.731603554088023,2.841890188081905,2.8739486825973213,3.2189558216683714,3.9571003681590526,3.969732115064953,3.9911462095687695,4.229557233013768,4.422928625994308,5.089758498236879,5.583416318380505,5.5623629091826725,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.508084609727827E-4,2.50586206915813E-4,2.506480785860334E-4,2.5059769030472606E-4,2.5062140640359223E-4,2.505848252590655E-4,2.506627606186684E-4,2.505475423240712E-4,2.505862598746461E-4,2.5084521362060496E-4,2.5283559737960333E-4,2.505866737783476E-4,2.50823995193873E-4,2.508501267267695E-4,2.507361720640575E-4,2.5059867737275797E-4,2.506848930096248E-4,2.508028661725358E-4,2.5061161470196677E-4,2.506106984410386E-4,2.5083616086100724E-4,2.506358070744791E-4,2.506361863900523E-4,2.507967466145733E-4,2.5061170510388666E-4,2.5085312500494215E-4,2.5067441971278974E-4,2.5058564530012773E-4,2.506992501229476E-4,2.5077576714783404E-4,2.506370364836773E-4,2.507712722224065E-4,2.5089439465660805E-4,2.5112726355820117E-4,2.5067398654034505E-4,2.505985253806875E-4,2.506888803013837E-4,2.5062397600113836E-4,2.5054780973712945E-4,2.5061153709162793E-4,2.508626926787701E-4,2.5072507870075726E-4,2.50771843686929E-4,2.505602794736535E-4,2.506116008157932E-4,2.505984311460739E-4,2.5068325644292275E-4,2.5072672523291804E-4,2.5067574137014486E-4,2.506360088222565E-4,2.5059905085673793E-4,2.511124876152883E-4,2.506621087966179E-4,2.5061154337593244E-4,2.506607664081853E-4,2.5058590168330793E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867684E-4,2.5059940266573084E-4,2.505857586424849E-4,2.507862332604838E-4,2.5068556137980246E-4,2.505856538910581E-4,2.5056017738972984E-4,2.5053498079616115E-4,2.507615040780928E-4,2.505979299011482E-4,2.507118423993318E-4,2.5078541996925827E-4,2.506716435043771E-4,2.506118753026197E-4,2.505605058574259E-4,2.506246038642504E-4,2.505603709024342E-4,2.505735199054815E-4,2.5056051294891277E-4,2.507231617352092E-4,2.5064853849859865E-4,2.50585988358406E-4,2.5061026230912783E-4]}}
{"value":"This is a bad B movie masquerading as a mockumentary. The porn documentary filmmaker in the movie has almost as much screen time and dialog as any other character.

The film is not funny. The film is not sexy. The film doesn't have anything insightful to say about the porn business. It's not even particularly salacious.

{"value":"This is the most messed up entry on IMDb that I've yet to stumble across. All the previous reviewers act like this is the movie. This is NOT the movie. Rather it's merely a featurette that's an extra on the DVD of the movie \"The One\" It also nowhere near being the 90 minutes that it's listed here as. In actuality it's barely over 13 minutes of how cool Jet Li can do martial arts. and his reflections on the movie. So yeah this IMDb entry is quite a bit fubar.

{"value":"To be honest, this film is another in a series of huge disappointments...most of these so-called \"masters of horror\" films are only horrifying in terms of their sub-par effects and laughable story lines...aside from Ron Perlman, everyone else in this film cannot act to save their life...the gunshots sounded like someone was playing Bop-it under the boom mike or something, and looked completely unrealistic...overall, this film is about as scary as Home Alone...the only good masters are Cigarette Burns, Jennifer, and maybe Pelts...I don't know how these directors can sleep

{"value":"Henry Sala's \"Nightmare Weekend\" is a rotten piece of sludge from Troma.This is a juvenile,sloppy and stupid low-budget horror film about some teenage girls spending the weekend at a mansion.The professor's evil assistant lures the girls into a bizarre scheme to perform hideous experiments.Using a brain implant she transforms her victims and their dates into zombies.\"Nightmare Weekend\" is a completely braindead piece of garbage that features lots of nudity and some cheesy gore,not to mention a laughable musical score.The acting is horrendous and the script is utterly incoherent.Why such piece of crap is widely distributed is beyond me.Avoid it like the plague.1 out of 10.","finished_norm":["henri","sala","nightmar","weekend","be","a","rotten","piec","of","sludg","from","tromathi","be","a","juvenilesloppi","and","stupid","lowbudget","horror","film","about","some","teenag","girl","spend","the","weekend","at","a","mansionth","professor","evil","assist","lure","the","girl","into","a","bizarr","scheme","to","perform","hideou","experimentsus","a","brain","implant","she","transform","her","victim","and","their","date","into","zombiesnightmar","weekend","be","a","complet","braindead","piec","of","garbag","that","featur","lot","of","nuditi","and","some","cheesi","gorenot","to","mention","a","laughabl","music","scoreth","act","be","horrend","and","the","script","be","utterli","incoherentwhi","such","piec","of","crap","be","wide","distribut","be","beyond","meavoid","it","like","the","plagu","out","of"],"filtered":["henri","sala","nightmar","weekend","rotten","piec","sludg","tromathi","juvenilesloppi","stupid","lowbudget","horror","film","teenag","girl","spend","weekend","mansionth","professor","evil","assist","lure","girl","bizarr","scheme","perform","hideou","experimentsus","brain","implant","transform","victim","date","zombiesnightmar","weekend","complet","braindead","piec","garbag","featur","lot","nuditi","cheesi","gorenot","mention","laughabl","music","scoreth","act","horrend","script","utterli","incoherentwhi","piec","crap","wide","distribut","beyond","meavoid","like","plagu"],"filtered2":["henri","sala","nightmar","weekend","rotten","piec","sludg","tromathi","juvenilesloppi","stupid","lowbudget","horror","teenag","girl","spend","weekend","mansionth","professor","evil","assist","lure","girl","bizarr","scheme","perform","hideou","experimentsus","brain","implant","transform","victim","date","zombiesnightmar","weekend","complet","braindead","piec","garbag","featur","lot","nuditi","cheesi","gorenot","mention","laughabl","music","scoreth","act","horrend","script","utterli","incoherentwhi","piec","crap","wide","distribut","beyond","meavoid","like","plagu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,21,72,77,83,84,103,105,118,136,218,283,285,305,313,321,502,535,543,552,612,647,673,693,702,816,823,1054,1222,1529,1565,1582,1612,1621,1681,1751,1923,2300,2435,2470,2581,2919,5026,7759],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,21,72,77,83,84,103,105,118,136,218,283,285,305,313,321,502,535,543,552,612,647,673,693,702,816,823,1054,1222,1529,1565,1582,1612,1621,1681,1751,1923,2300,2435,2470,2581,2919,5026,7759],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.162015545335049,1.9209463754160525,1.9463902258768238,2.292318797740072,4.442538903180445,2.098582041218749,2.1765612129984904,2.354379525480895,2.346825985579986,7.782262445585161,2.7678802023081546,2.808171552082607,2.8612813773965557,2.907069060519773,3.09496984188738,3.3132665011396125,3.4986697244709752,3.477726550625732,3.424750734647968,3.5929222627171646,3.6746621462132825,3.7297814454343623,3.753391311073496,3.6466665387238555,3.7881170224473255,3.850067611308864,4.3095999406873045,4.3336974922663645,4.671389985292807,14.01416995587842,4.621379564718146,5.02684467282631,4.724033718778229,4.662879295624898,5.0768550934009715,4.8184434032493035,5.064116067623542,5.143104478942172,5.1994574154933035,5.2288713006995975,5.408212229355414,6.255510089742618,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815696E-4,2.4557311712357496E-4,2.4563375102320043E-4,2.455843707821272E-4,2.456076124297671E-4,2.455717631074922E-4,2.456481393351681E-4,2.4553522603438366E-4,2.455731690229428E-4,2.458269422827268E-4,2.477775075192787E-4,2.4557357464631454E-4,2.458061483401665E-4,2.4583175709999247E-4,2.45720082151569E-4,2.4558533810341906E-4,2.4566982895768744E-4,2.4578544201440576E-4,2.4559801661553737E-4,2.455971186848212E-4,2.458180706276571E-4,2.45621725008755E-4,2.456220967359495E-4,2.4577944488095305E-4,2.455981052089262E-4,2.458346953962615E-4,2.4565956518386684E-4,2.4557256674326413E-4,2.4568389885049985E-4,2.457588851178833E-4,2.4562292982306915E-4,2.457544801154609E-4,2.4587513942998123E-4,2.46103349684445E-4,2.4565914067723176E-4,2.4558518915201836E-4,2.4567373648188103E-4,2.4561013062135846E-4,2.4553548809772344E-4,2.455979405578283E-4,2.4584407166447064E-4,2.457092107159918E-4,2.457550401475786E-4,2.45547708371559E-4,2.455980030071629E-4,2.4558509680261057E-4,2.4566822513123846E-4,2.4571082430853604E-4,2.4566086040087205E-4,2.456219227204773E-4,2.4558570411568404E-4,2.4608886934091685E-4,2.456475005531109E-4,2.455979467164124E-4,2.456461850197627E-4,2.455728179973835E-4,0.9805906755843552,2.456111314579804E-4,2.4558604888657974E-4,2.455726778181564E-4,2.4576914185124143E-4,2.4567048395681903E-4,2.4557257516232906E-4,2.4554760832987013E-4,2.4552291580549017E-4,2.457449073872683E-4,2.455846055853151E-4,2.456962392127305E-4,2.457683448302

{"value":"I had high hopes for this film. I thought the premise interesting. I stuck through it, even though I found the acting, save Helena Bonham Carter, unremarkable. I kept hoping my time spent would pay off, but in the end I was left me wondering why they even bothered to make this thing. Maybe in George Orwell's version there is a message worth conveying. If this film accomplished anything, it has inspired me to read Orwell's classic. I find it hard to believe his tale could be as disappointing as this adaption. If the film maker's message is \"the mundane life is worth living\", well then, they've succeeded. I would recommend this film to no one; 101 minutes of my life wasted.","finished_norm":["i","have","high","hope","for","thi","film","i","think","the","premis","interest","i","stick","through","it","even","though","i","find","the","act","save","helena","bonham","carter","unremark","i","keep","hope","my","time","spend","would","pai","off","but","in","the","end","i","be","leav","me","wonder","why","thei","even","bother","to","make","thi","thing","mayb","in","georg","orwel","version","there","be","a","messag","worth","convei","if","thi","film","accomplish","anyth","it","have","inspir","me","to","read","orwel","classic","i","find","it","hard","to","believ","hi","tale","can","be","a","disappoint","a","thi","adapt","if","the","film","maker","messag","be","the","mundan","life","be","worth","live","good","then","thei","have","succ","i","would","recommend","thi","film","to","no","on","minut","of","my","life","wast"],"filtered":["high","hope","thi","film","think","premis","interest","stick","even","though","find","act","save","helena","bonham","carter","unremark","keep","hope","time","spend","pai","end","leav","wonder","thei","even","bother","make","thi","thing","mayb","georg","orwel","version","messag","worth","convei","thi","film","accomplish","anyth","inspir","read","orwel","classic","find","hard","believ","hi","tale","disappoint","thi","adapt","film","maker","messag","mundan","life","worth","live","good","thei","succ","recommend","thi","film","minut","life","wast"],"filtered2":["high","hope","think","premis","interest","stick","even","though","find","act","save","helena","bonham","carter","unremark","keep","hope","time","spend","pai","end","leav","wonder","even","bother","make","thing","mayb","georg","orwel","version","messag","worth","convei","accomplish","anyth","inspir","read","orwel","classic","find","hard","believ","tale","disappoint","adapt","maker","messag","mundan","life","worth","live","good","succ","recommend","minut","life","wast"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,8,12,21,24,29,38,59,60,74,75,86,89,91,104,116,134,145,163,171,175,181,187,189,211,219,220,283,298,322,332,416,484,496,569,680,701,763,820,909,1139,1613,2000,3196,3418,5178,5917,7165,7501],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,8,12,21,24,29,38,59,60,74,75,86,89,91,104,116,134,145,163,171,175,181,187,189,211,219,220,283,298,322,332,416,484,496,569,680,701,763,820,909,1139,1613,2000,3196,3418,5178,5917,7165,7501],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,3.038623282696244,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,1.9486336368009016,3.948450049740535,2.031112399272319,1.9940046109572438,2.0105926690411424,2.0728240170322856,2.2466628996789315,2.2443961816702407,2.34599021453259,2.4000574358028657,2.373087554090762,2.3791142619576227,4.888457308232007,2.4732161909892554,2.498193474075453,2.5687161421197025,5.158418835671083,2.8336934208777267,2.7678802023081546,2.7819920465008363,2.885344817328191,2.9705344631698933,3.1401446412440817,3.291526514503207,3.293679367864308,7.2872074983866195,3.8095464139032247,3.8240921249056035,3.749984152751882,3.900174431363043,3.9612932464190886,4.186539847930077,4.6295428753573065,4.8796870284900224,5.501738287366237,5.7446844659766265,6.1754673820690815,13.589013180950609,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.082887361285244E-4,2.0810416094933743E-4,2.0815554347424265E-4,2.0811369755170683E-4,2.0813339304459242E-4,2.081030135257753E-4,2.0816773645214093E-4,2.0807205119149436E-4,2.0810420493002445E-4,2.083192580755695E-4,2.0997221075493507E-4,2.081045486643567E-4,2.0830163682280357E-4,2.0832333825958525E-4,2.082287024064718E-4,2.081145172814402E-4,2.0818611672416976E-4,2.082840898184765E-4,2.0812526133664203E-4,2.081245004100371E-4,2.083117400363145E-4,2.0814535236018643E-4,2.081456673701388E-4,2.0827900771323678E-4,2.0812533641266444E-4,2.0832582823766943E-4,2.0817741897229803E-4,2.0810369454473204E-4,2.0819803986654246E-4,2.082615849094174E-4,2.0814637334682737E-4,2.082578520116808E-4,2.083601014178987E-4,2.0855349190005527E-4,2.0817705923586535E-4,2.0811439105668632E-4,2.0818942804771049E-4,2.0813552701656117E-4,2.0807227326983938E-4,2.0812519688363546E-4,2.083337738974035E-4,2.0821948970841425E-4,2.0825832659544352E-4,2.080826290036547E-4,2.0812524980460067E-4,2.0811431279772928E-4,2.0818475760570686E-4,2.0822085710288504E-4,2.0817851656820455E-4,2.0814551990552924E-4,2.0811482744843317E-4,2.0854122093255087E-4,2.0816719513391523E-4,2.0812520210255765E-4,2.0816608032148452E-4,2.0810390746310155E-4,0.9835521036690726,2.0813637514793606E-4,2.08115119615014E-4,2.0810378867208414E-4,2.0827027669504354E-4,2.081866717851076E-4,2.081037016792363E-4,2.0808254422608632E-4,2.080616192

The result of this is just a little underwhelming, and the actors here don't really get me in a mood to care one way or another finding out. Why snake venom as a weapon? Who knows? Who cares?

{"value":"First off, the lead, Brad Dourif is a KOOK. If you're trying to take this movie seriously, then, I guarantee he's going to ruin it for you. If you don't take him too seriously, then he's actually kind of fun to watch. As with another reviewer, I loved the scene where Lisa (Cynthia Bain) and Dourif are declaring their love for each other - in between dodging the jets of flame shooting out of his arm in the car. Another great campy scene was watching John Landis as a snotty radio show producer getting toasted and flailing around the room. In fact, I found the last 15 minutes of the movie to be a non-stop laugh-riot - I'm just not sure if Tobe Hooper meant it to be that way.","finished_norm":["off","the","lead","brad","dourif","be","a","kook","if","you","re","try","to","take","thi","movi","serious","then","i","guarante","he","go","to","ruin","it","for","you","if","you","do","not","take","him","too","serious","then","he","actual","kind","of","fun","to","watch","a","with","anoth","review","i","love","the","scene","where","lisa","cynthia","bain","and","dourif","be","declar","their","love","for","each","other","in","between","dodg","the","jet","of","flame","shoot","out","of","hi","arm","in","the","car","anoth","great","campi","scene","be","watch","john","landi","a","a","snotti","radio","show","produc","get","toast","and","flail","around","the","room","in","fact","i","find","the","last","minut","of","the","movi","to","be","a","nonstop","laughriot","i","be","just","not","sure","if","tobe","hooper","mean","it","to","be","that","wai"],"filtered":["lead","brad","dourif","kook","re","try","take","thi","movi","serious","guarante","go","ruin","take","serious","actual","kind","fun","watch","anoth","review","love","scene","lisa","cynthia","bain","dourif","declar","love","dodg","jet","flame","shoot","hi","arm","car","anoth","great","campi","scene","watch","john","landi","snotti","radio","show","produc","get","toast","flail","around","room","fact","find","last","minut","movi","nonstop","laughriot","sure","tobe","hooper","mean","wai"],"filtered2":["lead","brad","dourif","kook","re","try","take","serious","guarante","go","ruin","take","serious","actual","kind","fun","watch","anoth","review","love","scene","lisa","cynthia","bain","dourif","declar","love","dodg","jet","flame","shoot","arm","car","anoth","great","campi","scene","watch","john","landi","snotti","radio","show","produc","get","toast","flail","around","room","fact","find","last","minut","nonstop","laughriot","sure","tobe","hooper","mean","wai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,19,28,31,33,36,38,51,52,54,59,68,73,88,97,98,117,119,122,144,157,176,259,261,284,291,371,513,710,992,1734,1765,2119,2467,2503,2583,2942,3062,3337,3938,4850,5225,6650,7005,7367,7536,8046,8213],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,19,28,31,33,36,38,51,52,54,59,68,73,88,97,98,117,119,122,144,157,176,259,261,284,291,371,513,710,992,1734,1765,2119,2467,2503,2583,2942,3062,3337,3938,4850,5225,6650,7005,7367,7536,8046,8213],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,2.62476135602347,1.5452294193519092,2.814133962290301,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,3.6227786505458823,1.8693254449200722,2.0064197866819473,3.7901378413541957,2.0317223413467334,2.0545557924622586,2.0881990796736947,2.2797301185117202,2.1653408989309972,2.2489347673732487,2.2931108769894046,2.3360150694757706,2.5040471493269134,2.7464553122240485,2.7085302779237206,3.110998680163279,3.016831637578237,6.093369201455837,3.454678155189441,3.6528204042982337,4.091229668125752,4.798834931860927,4.789173020949191,5.541743621979936,5.185068678041204,5.626901430320244,5.290429193699031,5.521540914662417,5.604922523601468,5.967828017290836,5.7959777603641776,6.1754673820690815,6.255510089742618,13.897314540605125,6.794506590475304,6.725513718988353,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.118807647961299E-4,2.1169300653874442E-4,2.1174527517734882E-4,2.117027076039155E-4,2.1172274275403066E-4,2.116918393273704E-4,2.1175767842838508E-4,2.1166034303434343E-4,2.1169305127789723E-4,2.119118131072541E-4,2.1359327166514596E-4,2.1169340094007562E-4,2.1189388796841985E-4,2.1191596365579472E-4,0.10647361206043189,2.1170354147023997E-4,2.1177637567609524E-4,2.1187603835847067E-4,2.1171447081128593E-4,2.1171369676217504E-4,2.119041654161848E-4,2.1173490831315593E-4,2.1173522875559013E-4,2.1187086861014447E-4,2.1171454718202658E-4,2.1191849657461982E-4,2.1176752792775877E-4,2.1169253209079138E-4,2.1178850443817648E-4,2.1185314534259407E-4,2.1173594690714975E-4,2.1184934806943353E-4,2.1195336081055477E-4,2.1215008639459374E-4,2.117671619875169E-4,2.1170341306868607E-4,2.117797441048319E-4,2.1172491352726208E-4,2.1166056894252484E-4,2.117144052467596E-4,2.1192657926066686E-4,2.118103241917792E-4,2.1184983083759697E-4,2.1167110326541523E-4,2.1171445908036956E-4,2.1170333346011972E-4,2.1177499311905102E-4,2.1181171516755466E-4,2.1176864445217788E-4,2.1173507874789008E-4,2.1170385698619592E-4,2.1213760380898712E-4,2.117571277748942E-4,2.1171441055568434E-4,2.1175599373704458E-4,2.1169274868102956E-4,0.8770066602715161,2.117257762850266E-4,2.1170415419131483E-4,2.1169262784141005E-4,2.118619870217945E-4,2.1177694030929725E-4,2.116925393483332E-4,2.1167101702582132E-4,2.1164973116690383E-4,2.11841096027697E-4,2.1170291001284926E-4,2.117991422816545

{"value":"I saw this director's \"Woman On The Beach\" and could not understand the good to great reviews. This film is much like that one, two people who are caught in a relationship with very little dynamic and even less interest to anyone else. Like his other films, you have to want to listen to vacuous dialog, wade through very little and become enchanted with underwritten, pretty uninteresting characters. If you feel you can like this film, don't let my review stop you. I do like minimalism in films, but I feel Tsai Ming-Liang's films are far superior. He has a fairly terrific actor in Lee Kang-Sheng in his films. There is nothing here. I wish IU liked it, but I don't. Oh, well.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","director","woman","on","the","beach","and","can","not","understand","the","good","to","great","review","thi","film","be","much","like","that","on","two","peopl","who","be","catch","in","a","relationship","with","veri","littl","dynam","and","even","littl","interest","to","anyon","els","like","hi","other","film","you","have","to","want","to","listen","to","vacuou","dialog","wade","through","veri","littl","and","becom","enchant","with","underwrit","pretti","uninterest","charact","if","you","feel","you","can","like","thi","film","do","not","let","my","review","stop","you","i","do","like","minim","in","film","but","i","feel","tsai","mingliang","film","be","far","superior","he","have","a","fairli","terrif","actor","in","lee","kangsheng","in","hi","film","there","be","noth","here","i","wish","iu","like","it","but","i","do","not","oh","good"],"filtered":["see","thi","director","woman","beach","understand","good","great","review","thi","film","much","like","two","peopl","catch","relationship","veri","littl","dynam","even","littl","interest","anyon","els","like","hi","film","want","listen","vacuou","dialog","wade","veri","littl","becom","enchant","underwrit","pretti","uninterest","charact","feel","like","thi","film","let","review","stop","like","minim","film","feel","tsai","mingliang","film","far","superior","fairli","terrif","actor","lee","kangsheng","hi","film","noth","wish","iu","like","oh","good"],"filtered2":["see","director","woman","beach","understand","good","great","review","like","two","peopl","catch","relationship","veri","littl","dynam","even","littl","interest","anyon","els","like","want","listen","vacuou","dialog","wade","veri","littl","becom","enchant","underwrit","pretti","uninterest","charact","feel","like","let","review","stop","like","minim","feel","tsai","mingliang","far","superior","fairli","terrif","actor","lee","kangsheng","noth","wish","iu","like","oh","good"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,10,14,15,23,37,41,43,47,49,51,58,60,70,78,101,115,124,158,176,196,212,234,315,399,432,512,570,577,819,845,1247,1641,1872,2066,2359,2960,4939,6935,7243,7436],"values":[5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,10,14,15,23,37,41,43,47,49,51,58,60,70,78,101,115,124,158,176,196,212,234,315,399,432,512,570,577,819,845,1247,1641,1872,2066,2359,2960,4939,6935,7243,7436],"values":[3.230191472788289,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.1238870241028365,3.3525245991777624,2.4001215597131385,1.364847727375781,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,3.321622407243643,1.7064694353107215,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,2.094675786251684,2.0064197866819473,2.098582041218749,2.201553588425805,2.2323930368088845,2.3106972614914807,5.008094298653827,2.478925055209576,2.5983793339432615,2.673149229007135,2.854312708080462,3.129115117668582,3.235085203598255,3.369778711402955,3.944626193933877,3.604618302480356,3.835141961092188,3.831445099210862,4.327618446189983,4.6295428753573065,4.911775343041523,4.933754249760298,5.129498826886393,5.521540914662417,6.101359409915359,6.868614562629026,6.725513718988353,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164687E-4,2.2324275812784242E-4,2.2329787848933392E-4,2.232529884731003E-4,2.2327411672029345E-4,2.232415272346225E-4,2.2331095844892426E-4,2.2320831253640875E-4,2.2324280530791718E-4,2.2347350255652837E-4,2.252466997550515E-4,2.2324317404730253E-4,2.2345459944065027E-4,2.2347787955470652E-4,2.233763593891776E-4,2.232538678343094E-4,2.2333067579914033E-4,2.2343577597443514E-4,2.232653934689041E-4,2.2326457718847392E-4,2.2346543761534048E-4,2.232869460197479E-4,2.2328728394519002E-4,2.2343032416998474E-4,2.2326547400635337E-4,2.234805506669642E-4,2.2332134532680137E-4,2.2324225779449955E-4,2.2334346629394202E-4,2.2341163393927905E-4,2.2328804127835634E-4,2.2340762949082048E-4,2.235173170595692E-4,2.2372477578809898E-4,2.2332095942123823E-4,2.2325373242729945E-4,2.2333422800586657E-4,2.2327640592866824E-4,2.23208550769907E-4,2.23265324327245E-4,2.234890743360061E-4,2.2336647651074413E-4,2.2340813859831585E-4,2.2321965983456395E-4,2.2326538109796105E-4,2.23253648475372E-4,2.2332921781121305E-4,2.2336794337671987E-4,2.2332252276763853E-4,2.2328712575322494E-4,2.232542005644897E-4,2.2371161216552612E-4,2.2331037775234818E-4,2.2326532992581917E-4,2.2330918184256584E-4,2.2324248620167721E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.232773157576045E-4,2.2325451398481268E-4,2.23242358769173E-4,2.2342095801135614E-4,2.233312712381461E-4,2.2324226544800536E-4,2.2321956888982693E-4,2.2319712169645216E-4,2.2339892722621774E-4,2.2325320192525625E-4,2.233546845271629E-4,2.2342023346478757E-4,2.2331887205251065E-4,2.2326562563335258E-4,2.2321986151580719E-4,2.2327696528065568E-4,2.23

{"value":"It had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance. The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it. The production was good; however, the script and acting were B-movie quality. The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors. The good actors didn't hold their own nor did they lift up the others. <br /><br />This movie is not worthy of more words, but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. play caricatures of themselves in other movies. <br /><br />If you are looking for mindless entertainment, I still wouldn't recommend this movie.","finished_norm":["it","have","all","the","cliché","of","movi","of","thi","typ","and","no","substanc","the","plot","go","nowher","and","at","the","end","of","the","movi","i","feel","like","a","sucker","for","watch","it","the","product","be","good","howev","the","script","and","act","be","bmovi","qualiti","the","cast","be","poor","becaus","there","be","good","actor","mix","in","with","crumbi","actor","the","good","actor","do","not","hold","their","own","nor","do","thei","lift","up","the","other","br","br","thi","movi","be","not","worthi","of","much","word","but","i","will","sai","much","to","meet","the","minimum","requir","of","ten","line","jame","wood","and","cuba","good","jr","plai","caricatur","of","themselv","in","other","movi","br","br","if","you","be","look","for","mindless","entertain","i","still","would","not","recommend","thi","movi"],"filtered":["cliché","movi","thi","typ","substanc","plot","go","nowher","end","movi","feel","like","sucker","watch","product","good","howev","script","act","bmovi","qualiti","cast","poor","becaus","good","actor","mix","crumbi","actor","good","actor","hold","thei","lift","br","br","thi","movi","worthi","much","word","sai","much","meet","minimum","requir","ten","line","jame","wood","cuba","good","jr","plai","caricatur","themselv","movi","br","br","look","mindless","entertain","still","recommend","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["cliché","typ","substanc","plot","go","nowher","end","feel","like","sucker","watch","product","good","howev","script","act","bmovi","qualiti","cast","poor","becaus","good","actor","mix","crumbi","actor","good","actor","hold","lift","worthi","word","meet","minimum","requir","ten","line","jame","wood","cuba","good","jr","plai","caricatur","themselv","look","mindless","entertain","still","recommend"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,7,16,21,22,24,32,40,41,43,64,77,92,107,113,146,190,195,258,298,319,350,384,414,436,523,545,620,655,782,799,989,1286,1337,1434,1819,1844,1874,2137,3019,3171,3713],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,6,7,16,21,22,24,32,40,41,43,64,77,92,107,113,146,190,195,258,298,319,350,384,414,436,523,545,620,655,782,799,989,1286,1337,1434,1819,1844,1874,2137,3019,3171,3713],"values":[0.6460382945576578,2.714457859969082,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,1.6284968758320737,4.70627975028631,1.6608112036218214,1.883428577602134,1.9463902258768238,2.0489535369135887,2.1439533986393955,2.1521782565202803,2.326138445979858,2.558331832813986,2.51289241584188,2.7061321952397077,2.7819920465008363,2.9056060024680126,3.0135689919434205,3.109204957709252,3.1254654785810323,3.2070272508030975,3.4986697244709752,3.442099372982581,3.7568101178222815,3.7297814454343623,3.7568101178222815,3.7636829971100436,4.044492190274062,4.499089986959872,4.396611317676934,4.477736862489302,4.8085911068062925,4.9227044135737135,4.8184434032493035,5.014723312293965,5.408212229355414,5.501738287366237,6.101359409915359]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.457909248881568E-4,2.455731171235748E-4,2.456337510232003E-4,2.4558437078212703E-4,2.45607612429767E-4,2.4557176310749206E-4,2.456481393351679E-4,2.4553522603438355E-4,2.455731690229427E-4,2.458269422827267E-4,2.477775075192785E-4,2.455735746463144E-4,2.458061483401663E-4,2.458317570999923E-4,2.4572008215156886E-4,2.4558533810341895E-4,2.456698289576873E-4,2.457854420144056E-4,2.455980166155372E-4,2.4559711868482105E-4,2.4581807062765696E-4,2.456217250087548E-4,2.4562209673594936E-4,2.4577944488095294E-4,2.45598105208926E-4,2.4583469539626136E-4,2.456595651838667E-4,2.4557256674326397E-4,2.456838988504997E-4,2.457588851178831E-4,2.45622929823069E-4,2.457544801154608E-4,2.4587513942998107E-4,2.461033496844448E-4,2.456591406772316E-4,2.4558518915201825E-4,2.456737364818809E-4,2.4561013062135835E-4,2.455354880977233E-4,2.4559794055782814E-4,2.4584407166447053E-4,2.457092107159916E-4,2.457550401475784E-4,2.455477083715589E-4,2.455980030071628E-4,2.4558509680261046E-4,2.456682251312383E-4,2.457108243085359E-4,2.456608604008719E-4,2.456219227204772E-4,2.455857041156839E-4,2.4608886934091674E-4,2.456475005531107E-4,2.455979467164123E-4,2.456461850197626E-4,2.455728179973833E-4,0.9805906755843552,2.456111314579803E-4,2.4558604888657963E-4,2.4557267781815626E-4,2.457691418512413E-4,2.4567048395681887E-4,2.4557257516232895E-4,2.4554760832986997E-4,2.4552291580549E-4,2.4574490738726813E-4,2.45584605585315E-4,2.4569623921273035E-4,2.4576834483027257E-4,2.456568445147522E-4,2.455982720027569E-4,2.455479302264221E-4,2.456107459237864E-4,2.4554779797126566E-4,2.4556068392259204E-4,2.455479371760405E-4,2.4570733210020173E-4,2.4563420173500777E-4,2.455729029385071E-4,2.455966912779254E-4]}}
{"value":"This movie starts out with a certain amount of promise; but, in my view, begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down. That this well-meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough, but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories.<br /><br />I found this movie average at best. Art direction could have been much better, as could have been cinematography. The acting was good, and so was Eva van der Gucht's singing.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","start","out","with","a","certain","amount","of","promis","but","in","my","view","begin","to","lose","it","when","the","protagonist","kidnap","the","good","samaritan","who","come","to","hi","aid","when","hi","car","break","down","that","thi","wellmean","strang","begin","to","fix","hi","car","while","he","be","awai","make","a","phone","call","be","implaus","enough","but","that","she","be","on","of","the","few","peopl","in","the","countri","who","can","help","him","put","hi","famili","life","back","on","track","be","the","typ","of","coincid","begin","writer","be","warn","against","us","in","their","storiesbr","br","i","find","thi","movi","averag","at","well","art","direct","can","have","be","much","well","a","can","have","be","cinematographi","the","act","be","good","and","so","be","eva","van","der","gucht","sing"],"filtered":["thi","movi","start","certain","amount","promis","view","begin","lose","protagonist","kidnap","good","samaritan","come","hi","aid","hi","car","break","thi","wellmean","strang","begin","fix","hi","car","awai","make","phone","call","implaus","enough","peopl","countri","help","put","hi","famili","life","back","track","typ","coincid","begin","writer","warn","us","storiesbr","br","find","thi","movi","averag","well","art","direct","much","well","cinematographi","act","good","eva","van","der","gucht","sing"],"filtered2":["start","certain","amount","promis","view","begin","lose","protagonist","kidnap","good","samaritan","come","aid","car","break","wellmean","strang","begin","fix","car","awai","make","phone","call","implaus","enough","peopl","countri","help","put","famili","life","back","track","typ","coincid","begin","writer","warn","us","storiesbr","find","averag","well","art","direct","well","cinematographi","act","good","eva","van","der","gucht","sing"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,20,21,23,34,38,56,63,71,75,93,102,142,147,155,159,182,185,221,284,287,312,360,382,384,417,527,608,629,643,660,683,771,774,818,867,983,1281,1370,1951,2058,2182,2810,2936,5691],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,20,21,23,34,38,56,63,71,75,93,102,142,147,155,159,182,185,221,284,287,312,360,382,384,417,527,608,629,643,660,683,771,774,818,867,983,1281,1370,1951,2058,2182,2810,2936,5691],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.364847727375781,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.8610609350701788,1.8729627573220065,1.9214926742550966,1.9742250248702675,2.035389827120098,2.087553710177271,2.2844323215331563,6.853296964599469,2.3074766467914385,2.300267965194495,2.7365296724240786,2.518833027372001,2.6423424573643777,6.221997360326558,2.841890188081905,2.8824835850471584,3.028335462059722,3.235085203598255,3.109204957709252,3.1932880749197934,3.439602492783994,3.616452760127359,3.488143311483988,3.5813614403160887,3.8023521382691974,3.6105180246075443,3.7398317812878634,3.753391311073496,4.202455303235976,3.8844878351953436,4.165705761027235,4.34596758485818,4.520909034354511,4.900964426937307,4.9676558014359795,5.02684467282631,5.3064295350454715,5.770002273960917,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918335E-4,2.3612552253122047E-4,2.3618382374676017E-4,2.361363432433455E-4,2.3615869074724883E-4,2.3612422060632413E-4,2.3619765851711898E-4,2.3608908917345167E-4,2.361255724339358E-4,2.3636958262639022E-4,2.3824510646673088E-4,2.3612596245232105E-4,2.3634958866039727E-4,2.3637421220985624E-4,2.3626683357713373E-4,2.3613727335022435E-4,2.3621851370481573E-4,2.3632967894044411E-4,2.3614946409949658E-4,2.3614860071362589E-4,2.3636105227822513E-4,2.3617226039252104E-4,2.3617261781876982E-4,2.3632391252640503E-4,2.3614954928455456E-4,2.3637703746512038E-4,2.3620864479495738E-4,2.3612499332492946E-4,2.362320423061187E-4,2.363041437306393E-4,2.361734188556819E-4,2.3629990819577735E-4,2.364159255515168E-4,2.366353561887682E-4,2.3620823661977842E-4,2.361371301292247E-4,2.3622227090024016E-4,2.3616111205994095E-4,2.360893411547913E-4,2.3614939096785047E-4,2.3638605301314213E-4,2.3625638038324835E-4,2.363004466825546E-4,2.3610109129494796E-4,2.361494510146583E-4,2.3613704133264784E-4,2.3621697158016157E-4,2.362579318982803E-4,2.3620989018287164E-4,2.3617245049795398E-4,2.361376252814061E-4,2.3662143292745174E-4,2.361970443100396E-4,2.3614939688950393E-4,2.361957793873849E-4,2.361252349128969E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.36162074392761E-4,2.361379567884084E-4,2.361251001265912E-4,2.363140058708932E-4,2.3621914350507243E-4,2.361250014200994E-4,2.3610099510202448E-4,2.3607725253895354E-4,2.362907037459051E-4,2.361365690132754E-4,2.362439079146758E-4,2.363132395126089E-4,2.3620602879437951E-4,2.3614970966155723E-4,2.3610130461469608E-4,2.3616170369069044E-4,2.3610117744760924E-4,2.3611356765556807E

{"value":"If you loved \"Pulp Fiction\" and like hand held cameras you should love this film. I liked the quirky story (even though I feel that \"Pulp Fiction\" was the most over-rated movie since \"The English Patient\") and found the characters unrealistic but interesting. It's not \"On the Waterfront\" or \"Citizen Kane\" and is burdened by European pretentiousness. But the worst part by far is the hand held camera. It is so distracting and annoying I found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end. I don't know why new directors think this method of filming is so great. If you are prone to motion sickness, stay away, the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about 10 minutes.","finished_norm":["if","you","love","pulp","fiction","and","like","hand","hold","camera","you","should","love","thi","film","i","like","the","quirki","stori","even","though","i","feel","that","pulp","fiction","be","the","much","overr","movi","sinc","the","english","patient","and","find","the","charact","unrealist","but","interest","it","not","on","the","waterfront","or","citizen","kane","and","be","burden","by","european","pretenti","but","the","wrong","part","by","far","be","the","hand","hold","camera","it","be","so","distract","and","annoi","i","find","myself","wait","desper","for","the","movi","to","end","i","do","not","know","why","new","director","think","thi","method","of","film","be","so","great","if","you","be","prone","to","motion","sick","stai","awai","the","hand","hold","camera","will","have","you","nauseou","in","about","minut"],"filtered":["love","pulp","fiction","like","hand","hold","camera","love","thi","film","like","quirki","stori","even","though","feel","pulp","fiction","much","overr","movi","sinc","english","patient","find","charact","unrealist","interest","waterfront","citizen","kane","burden","european","pretenti","wrong","part","far","hand","hold","camera","distract","annoi","find","wait","desper","movi","end","know","new","director","think","thi","method","film","great","prone","motion","sick","stai","awai","hand","hold","camera","nauseou","minut"],"filtered2":["love","pulp","fiction","like","hand","hold","camera","love","like","quirki","stori","even","though","feel","pulp","fiction","overr","sinc","english","patient","find","charact","unrealist","interest","waterfront","citizen","kane","burden","european","pretenti","wrong","part","far","hand","hold","camera","distract","annoi","find","wait","desper","end","know","new","director","think","method","great","prone","motion","sick","stai","awai","hand","hold","camera","nauseou","minut"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,10,12,17,24,25,26,38,43,51,54,58,59,60,61,86,87,101,155,162,231,235,271,331,366,414,588,778,788,916,1021,1047,1264,1356,1406,1914,2112,2342,2371,2722,2833,3099,6672,6877,7703],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,10,12,17,24,25,26,38,43,51,54,58,59,60,61,86,87,101,155,162,231,235,271,331,366,414,588,778,788,916,1021,1047,1264,1356,1406,1914,2112,2342,2371,2722,2833,3099,6672,6877,7703],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.926017105726131,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,3.038623282696244,1.6608112036218214,1.7139899308309823,3.6227786505458823,1.865701314626681,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.031112399272319,2.115024371522662,2.098582041218749,2.3074766467914385,2.3586007221245198,8.114805921017584,7.93715681334295,2.757740698455715,2.932274249550174,3.008694896185175,9.376396435743096,3.6375061693251913,3.8059428063999263,3.753391311073496,8.201690253650389,4.076977645418551,4.140259095366071,4.327618446189983,4.396611317676934,4.662879295624898,5.039114765418124,4.9909126636002465,5.129498826886393,5.089758498236879,5.274680836730892,5.373120909544144,11.253802860640487,6.660975197850782,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612976E-4,2.1169300653874429E-4,2.1174527517734868E-4,2.1170270760391538E-4,2.1172274275403053E-4,2.1169183932737026E-4,2.1175767842838498E-4,2.116603430343433E-4,2.116930512778971E-4,2.1191181310725398E-4,2.1359327166514582E-4,2.1169340094007549E-4,2.118938879684197E-4,2.1191596365579459E-4,2.1181969576676942E-4,2.1170354147023986E-4,2.1177637567609513E-4,2.1187603835847054E-4,2.1171447081128582E-4,2.117136967621749E-4,2.119041654161847E-4,2.117349083131558E-4,2.1173522875559E-4,2.1187086861014433E-4,2.1171454718202644E-4,2.1191849657461968E-4,2.1176752792775863E-4,2.1169253209079125E-4,2.1178850443817634E-4,2.1185314534259394E-4,2.1173594690714965E-4,2.1184934806943342E-4,2.1195336081055463E-4,2.121500863945936E-4,2.1176716198751676E-4,2.1170341306868593E-4,2.1177974410483178E-4,2.1172491352726194E-4,2.1166056894252473E-4,2.1171440524675946E-4,2.1192657926066673E-4,2.1181032419177907E-4,2.1184983083759687E-4,2.1167110326541513E-4,2.1171445908036942E-4,2.1170333346011959E-4,2.1177499311905089E-4,2.1181171516755453E-4,2.1176864445217775E-4,2.1173507874788997E-4,2.1170385698619578E-4,2.12137603808987E-4,2.1175712777489407E-4,2.117144105556842E-4,2.1175599373704447E-4,2.1169274868102942E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502648E-4,2.1170415419131472E-4,2.1169262784140994E-4,2.1186198702179438E-4,2.1177694030929711E-4,2.116925393483331E-4,2.116710170258212E-4,2.116497311669037E-4,2.1184109602769686E-4,2.1170291001284912E-4,2.1179914228165443E-4,2.118612999605756E-4,2.1176518261149848E-4,2.1171469096440757E-4,2.116712945124195

{"value":"A one is the highest rating I could have given this movie, considering zero and negative numbers are not allowed. Pee yew, pointless mess of a movie with a lot of wasted b-list actors who have done better work, written and directed by some guy with the mentality of a twelve year old who smirks and giggles at stupid puns, and poop and fart jokes. For example, Gene Stapelton's (Ding-Bat from All in the Family) character telling Marilu Henner's character that she \"swings both ways\" sexually, was a cheap attempt at humor indicative of the general lameness of the movie...

{"value":"This kind of film has become old hat by now, hasn't it? The whole thing is syrupy nostalgia turned in upon itself in some kind of feedback loop.<br /><br />It sure sounds like a good idea: a great ensemble cast, some good gags, and some human drama about what could have/might have been. Unfortunately, there is no central event that binds them all together, like there was in \"The Big Chill\", one of those seminal movies that spawned copycat films like this one. You end up wanting to see more of one or two particular people instead of getting short takes on everyone. The superficiality this creates is not just annoying, it's maddening. The below-average script doesn't help.","finished_norm":["thi","kind","of","film","have","becom","old","hat","by","now","have","not","it","the","whole","thing","be","syrupi","nostalgia","turn","in","upon","itself","in","some","kind","of","feedback","loopbr","br","it","sure","sound","like","a","good","idea","a","great","ensembl","cast","some","good","gag","and","some","human","drama","about","what","can","havemight","have","be","unfortun","there","be","no","central","event","that","bind","them","all","togeth","like","there","be","in","the","big","chill","on","of","that","semin","movi","that","spawn","copycat","film","like","thi","on","you","end","up","want","to","see","much","of","on","or","two","particular","peopl","instead","of","get","short","take","on","everyon","the","superfici","thi","creat","be","not","just","annoi","it","madden","the","belowaverag","script","doe","not","help"],"filtered":["thi","kind","film","becom","old","hat","whole","thing","syrupi","nostalgia","turn","upon","kind","feedback","loopbr","br","sure","sound","like","good","idea","great","ensembl","cast","good","gag","human","drama","havemight","unfortun","central","event","bind","togeth","like","big","chill","semin","movi","spawn","copycat","film","like","thi","end","want","see","much","two","particular","peopl","instead","get","short","take","everyon","superfici","thi","creat","annoi","madden","belowaverag","script","doe","help"],"filtered2":["kind","becom","old","hat","whole","thing","syrupi","nostalgia","turn","upon","kind","feedback","loopbr","sure","sound","like","good","idea","great","ensembl","cast","good","gag","human","drama","havemight","unfortun","central","event","bind","togeth","like","big","chill","semin","spawn","copycat","like","end","want","see","two","particular","peopl","instead","get","short","take","everyon","superfici","creat","annoi","madden","belowaverag","script","doe","help"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,18,23,24,29,31,37,47,51,67,77,82,92,96,111,115,119,122,123,152,178,185,227,246,270,271,272,292,362,463,470,630,832,998,1263,1732,2245,2454,2970,4206,4268,4481,8140,8413],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,18,23,24,29,31,37,47,51,67,77,82,92,96,111,115,119,122,123,152,178,185,227,246,270,271,272,292,362,463,470,630,832,998,1263,1732,2245,2454,2970,4206,4268,4481,8140,8413],"values":[1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,1.2153159934048174,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,1.7064694353107215,1.7139899308309823,1.9570915389266579,1.9463902258768238,2.020196584395323,2.0489535369135887,2.0390708128715254,2.1183455303375887,2.201553588425805,2.1653408989309972,4.497869534746497,2.2619070973220485,2.3131195476980753,2.532833256045391,2.518833027372001,2.6005321873043625,2.673149229007135,2.731603554088023,2.757740698455715,2.8028805344481915,2.9752256367457734,3.058539100262467,3.3467891931782563,3.3814747511661465,3.558633189238533,3.7987743169213135,4.135246553542527,4.390138803171316,4.760735085628657,5.0768550934009715,5.116075806554253,5.444579873526289,5.9370563586240825,5.907203395474402,6.0662680901040895,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918373E-4,2.3612552253122088E-4,2.3618382374676058E-4,2.3613634324334587E-4,2.361586907472492E-4,2.361242206063245E-4,2.3619765851711936E-4,2.3608908917345205E-4,2.361255724339362E-4,2.363695826263906E-4,2.3824510646673126E-4,2.3612596245232146E-4,2.3634958866039767E-4,2.3637421220985662E-4,2.3626683357713413E-4,2.3613727335022473E-4,2.362185137048161E-4,2.363296789404445E-4,2.3614946409949698E-4,2.3614860071362627E-4,2.363610522782255E-4,2.3617226039252144E-4,2.361726178187702E-4,2.363239125264054E-4,2.3614954928455497E-4,2.3637703746512079E-4,2.3620864479495776E-4,2.3612499332492984E-4,2.3623204230611907E-4,2.3630414373063967E-4,2.3617341885568232E-4,2.3629990819577776E-4,2.3641592555151717E-4,2.3663535618876857E-4,2.362082366197788E-4,2.361371301292251E-4,2.3622227090024054E-4,2.3616111205994133E-4,2.360893411547917E-4,2.3614939096785085E-4,2.363860530131425E-4,2.3625638038324873E-4,2.3630044668255498E-4,2.3610109129494833E-4,2.3614945101465868E-4,2.3613704133264825E-4,2.3621697158016195E-4,2.3625793189828068E-4,2.3620989018287205E-4,2.3617245049795439E-4,2.3613762528140652E-4,2.3662143292745212E-4,2.3619704431004E-4,2.361493968895043E-4,2.361957793873853E-4,2.3612523491289727E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.361620743927614E-4,2.3613795678840882E-4,2.3612510012659157E-4,2.363140058708936E-4,2.362191435050728E-4,2.3612500142009978E-4,2.3610099510202486E-4,2.3607725253895392E-4,2.362907037459055E-4,2.361365690132758E-4,2.362439079146762E-4,2.3631323951260928E-4,2.3620602879437992E-4,2.3614970966155763E-4,2.3610130461469649

{"value":"I don't even know where to begin on this one. \"It's all about the family.\" That has to be the worst line of dialogue ever heard in a \"horror\" movie, although this couldn't be a horror movie even if it tried!!! Ugh!!! And I know that Owen Wilson is a better actor. He needs to stop playing the token guy who dies in every action movie (Anaconda, Armageddon). After all, the man did co-write \"Bottle Rocket\" and \"Rushmore.\" He does have some talent. Also, Lily Taylor should stick to indie films. She has no place here. Finally, Catherine Zeta-Jones should become a porn star. There's no room in legitimate acting for her. I'm serious.

{"value":"Wow...what can I say...First off IMDb says this is in the late 60s...which means Carlito would be very close to going to prison, He got out in 75 and said he was in for 5 years. They used a bunch of nobody actors, and a story that didn't even make sense. They bring back only one actor, Guzman, and hes playing a totally different guy. Why did it end with him and this Puerto Rican chick? Wheres Gale? He said he was in love with her before. Wheres Kleinfeld? He said he knew him forever...You'd think he'd have been in this one. And if this made sense, where are Rocco and the black dude in the first one? It was all just stupid...This is an insult to Pacino and the first film.","finished_norm":["wowwhat","can","i","sayfirst","off","imdb","sai","thi","be","in","the","late","swhich","mean","carlito","would","be","veri","close","to","go","to","prison","he","get","out","in","and","sai","he","be","in","for","year","thei","us","a","bunch","of","nobodi","actor","and","a","stori","that","do","not","even","make","sens","thei","bring","back","onli","on","actor","guzman","and","he","plai","a","total","differ","gui","why","do","it","end","with","him","and","thi","puerto","rican","chick","where","gale","he","sai","he","be","in","love","with","her","befor","where","kleinfeld","he","sai","he","know","him","foreveryoud","think","he","have","have","be","in","thi","on","and","if","thi","make","sens","where","be","rocco","and","the","black","dude","in","the","on","it","be","all","just","stupidthi","be","a","insult","to","pacino","and","the","film"],"filtered":["wowwhat","sayfirst","imdb","sai","thi","late","swhich","mean","carlito","veri","close","go","prison","get","sai","year","thei","us","bunch","nobodi","actor","stori","even","make","sens","thei","bring","back","onli","actor","guzman","plai","total","differ","gui","end","thi","puerto","rican","chick","gale","sai","love","befor","kleinfeld","sai","know","foreveryoud","think","thi","thi","make","sens","rocco","black","dude","stupidthi","insult","pacino","film"],"filtered2":["wowwhat","sayfirst","imdb","late","swhich","mean","carlito","veri","close","go","prison","get","year","us","bunch","nobodi","actor","stori","even","make","sens","bring","back","onli","actor","guzman","plai","total","differ","gui","end","puerto","rican","chick","gale","love","befor","kleinfeld","know","foreveryoud","think","make","sens","rocco","black","dude","stupidthi","insult","pacino"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,6,11,12,15,17,24,26,40,41,54,55,56,57,63,79,88,150,173,184,204,229,250,295,419,591,709,852,866,1041,1427,2298,2719,3457,4910,6479],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,6,11,12,15,17,24,26,40,41,54,55,56,57,63,79,88,150,173,184,204,229,250,295,419,591,709,852,866,1041,1427,2298,2719,3457,4910,6479],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,1.8113893252729412,1.9536997889255368,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,1.8729627573220065,1.9469506069506084,2.0317223413467334,2.332712011146513,4.8737648638280495,2.496249838866882,2.624524614047584,2.8432628718938773,2.6812935439488212,2.7910771187233068,3.1758963322079246,3.509308122676031,3.6497387377608255,4.2078172463773615,3.8962296530720266,4.176068548062782,4.605250182788262,5.521540914662417,6.2980697041614135,6.725513718988353,6.948657270302562,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.9262343200910746E-4,2.923641235923333E-4,2.9243631055290796E-4,2.9237752150028986E-4,2.9240519156459777E-4,2.923625115847569E-4,2.924534403848198E-4,2.9231901281142567E-4,2.92364185380502E-4,2.926663120853994E-4,2.949885340882548E-4,2.92364668290533E-4,2.926415561069605E-4,2.9267204430823634E-4,2.9253909104036456E-4,2.923786731330298E-4,2.9247926270427067E-4,2.9261690443964947E-4,2.923937673832773E-4,2.9239269836265345E-4,2.9265575004306494E-4,2.924219931259239E-4,2.924224356812684E-4,2.926097646244837E-4,2.923938728570717E-4,2.926755424615506E-4,2.9246704329168613E-4,2.92363468343668E-4,2.924960134460836E-4,2.925852874456232E-4,2.9242342750312767E-4,2.9258004312292317E-4,2.927236926198884E-4,2.929953855959869E-4,2.924665379004129E-4,2.9237849580072967E-4,2.924839147602435E-4,2.9240818956733624E-4,2.923193248077856E-4,2.9239367683368573E-4,2.926867052649944E-4,2.925261481833778E-4,2.9258070986243106E-4,2.923338735079522E-4,2.9239375118199064E-4,2.923783858552519E-4,2.9247735328796466E-4,2.9252806922659116E-4,2.924685852967273E-4,2.9242222850923906E-4,2.923791088845336E-4,2.9297814619700665E-4,2.9245267989051765E-4,2.923936841657141E-4,2.924511136980985E-4,2.9236376747124055E-4,0.9768924620546159,2.924093811013497E-4,2.923795193473804E-4,2.923636005825463E-4,2.925974984762698E-4,2.924800425056158E-4,2.9236347836688464E-4,2.923337544045217E-4,2.9230435701634586E-4,2.9256864642640686E-4,2.9237780104240366E-4,2.9251070511604585E-4,2.9259654959253305E-4,2.924638042317655E-4,2.923940714314627E-4,2.9233413763459355E-4,2.92408922108248E-4,2.923339801798064E-4,2.923493213943103E-4,2.923341459083783E-4,2.92523911619924E-4,2.924368471424342E-4,2.9236386859687473E-4,2.9239218951850987E-4]}}
{"value":"I was required to watch the movie for my work, so I didn't pay for it (on the contrary, i got paid), but I still found the movie to suck far more than average. The jokes were lame, the two lead actresses... well, to use the \"First wives club\" division of women's ages in Hollywood, they are no longer in their \"hot chick\" age but more in their \"district attorney\" age. What angered me most about the movie was the main plot line, which pretty much completely plagiarized \"Beavis & Butthead Do America\" (in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to \"do his wife\", not realizing they're expected to assassinate her). All in all, a bland piece of crap.","finished_norm":["i","be","requir","to","watch","the","movi","for","my","work","so","i","do","not","pai","for","it","on","the","contrari","i","get","pai","but","i","still","find","the","movi","to","suck","far","much","than","averag","the","joke","be","lame","the","two","lead","actress","good","to","us","the","wife","club","divis","of","woman","ag","in","hollywood","thei","be","no","long","in","their","hot","chick","ag","but","much","in","their","district","attornei","ag","what","anger","me","much","about","the","movi","be","the","main","plot","line","which","pretti","much","complet","plagiar","beavi","butthead","do","america","in","which","the","boi","be","all","jazz","up","about","some","dude","offer","them","monei","to","do","hi","wife","not","realiz","thei","re","expect","to","assassin","her","all","in","all","a","bland","piec","of","crap"],"filtered":["requir","watch","movi","work","pai","contrari","get","pai","still","find","movi","suck","far","much","averag","joke","lame","two","lead","actress","good","us","wife","club","divis","woman","ag","hollywood","thei","long","hot","chick","ag","much","district","attornei","ag","anger","much","movi","main","plot","line","pretti","much","complet","plagiar","beavi","butthead","america","boi","jazz","dude","offer","monei","hi","wife","realiz","thei","re","expect","assassin","bland","piec","crap"],"filtered2":["requir","watch","work","pai","contrari","get","pai","still","find","suck","far","averag","joke","lame","two","lead","actress","good","us","wife","club","divis","woman","ag","hollywood","long","hot","chick","ag","district","attornei","ag","anger","main","plot","line","pretti","complet","plagiar","beavi","butthead","america","boi","jazz","dude","offer","monei","wife","realiz","re","expect","assassin","bland","piec","crap"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,32,38,47,48,56,64,68,70,78,99,101,103,107,126,130,157,179,214,218,263,282,300,313,322,355,373,405,421,442,507,643,666,808,989,1028,1035,1041,1427,1809,2453,3255,3812,4019,5993,6285,6694],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,32,38,47,48,56,64,68,70,78,99,101,103,107,126,130,157,179,214,218,263,282,300,313,322,355,373,405,421,442,507,643,666,808,989,1028,1035,1041,1427,1809,2453,3255,3812,4019,5993,6285,6694],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.3711311285073675,1.519311641348122,1.7064694353107215,1.6955116224012472,1.8610609350701788,1.883428577602134,2.0064197866819473,2.094675786251684,2.0064197866819473,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.098582041218749,2.1439533986393955,2.2391270689902285,2.2642139034199635,2.3360150694757706,2.507968722980095,2.7303758068497004,2.5940874818617203,5.805372584729356,2.918851229218033,2.932274249550174,2.907069060519773,5.770689634656382,3.0316467233633775,3.070535816550098,3.109204957709252,3.2597778161886266,9.773089949954407,3.365138331846453,3.5813614403160887,3.6621227969605474,3.90413483257914,4.044492190274062,4.086456389373095,4.2860694432771105,4.176068548062782,4.605250182788262,5.014723312293965,5.156897801074508,5.521540914662417,5.967828017290836,5.9370563586240825,6.437831646536572,6.543192162194399,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125572E-4,2.273779263270828E-4,2.274340676935461E-4,2.2738834617097765E-4,2.2740986578072443E-4,2.2737667263379293E-4,2.2744738993572337E-4,2.2734284269338746E-4,2.2737797438108308E-4,2.276129448788429E-4,2.2941898753711746E-4,2.2737834995069841E-4,2.2759369161694305E-4,2.2761740295299337E-4,2.2751400231007027E-4,2.273892418207622E-4,2.2746747251417917E-4,2.2757451948007208E-4,2.2740098094688535E-4,2.2740014954633704E-4,2.276047305492108E-4,2.2742293271974025E-4,2.2742327690463982E-4,2.275689666908077E-4,2.2740106297614517E-4,2.2762012354277298E-4,2.2745796921172103E-4,2.2737741672596996E-4,2.2748049992975627E-4,2.2754993025739294E-4,2.2742404826603285E-4,2.2754585163377162E-4,2.2765757096628256E-4,2.2786887249242002E-4,2.274575761579555E-4,2.2738910390558234E-4,2.274710905191083E-4,2.2741219739254268E-4,2.2734308533973026E-4,2.274009105245021E-4,2.2762880509736273E-4,2.275039363691941E-4,2.2754637017156223E-4,2.2735440017971123E-4,2.2740096834679297E-4,2.2738901839859736E-4,2.2746598751966334E-4,2.2750543040620818E-4,2.2745916846251944E-4,2.2742311578245478E-4,2.2738958071416712E-4,2.2785546503755488E-4,2.2744679848279382E-4,2.2740091622677975E-4,2.2744558042094644E-4,2.2737764936397737E-4,0.9820287660604775,2.274131240744139E-4,2.273898999400345E-4,2.2737751957101657E-4,2.2755942704103598E-4,2.2746807898261525E-4,2.2737742452124313E-4,2.273543075503875E-4,2.2733144456336734E-4,2.275369881754614E-4,2.273885635769486E-4,2.274919259604513E-4,2.275586890735531E-4,2.2745545012449876E-4,2.274012174117602E-4,2.27354605596

{"value":"What a complete waste of time. The movie starts as a clone of the Saw series, but with even worse acting. Melissa Joan Hart is absolutely horrible. The ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists, not plot surprises and just a plain bad ending. I liked some of the characters and I was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end. It just doesn't happen. It's a total \"Wrestler\" ending with none of the good acting. I can't believe I spent the time watching this. It's not \"fun\" as some people put it. A guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out. The connection is a stretch and he should have shot the main actress first.","finished_norm":["what","a","complet","wast","of","time","the","movi","start","a","a","clone","of","the","see","seri","but","with","even","wrong","act","melissa","joan","hart","be","absolut","horribl","the","end","be","ridicul","and","the","stori","contain","no","twist","not","plot","surpris","and","just","a","plain","bad","end","i","like","some","of","the","charact","and","i","be","hope","for","everyth","to","be","tie","togeth","at","the","end","it","just","doe","not","happen","it","a","total","wrestler","end","with","none","of","the","good","act","i","ca","not","believ","i","spend","the","time","watch","thi","it","not","fun","a","some","peopl","put","it","a","gui","in","a","mask","kidnap","peopl","who","be","connect","and","forc","them","to","figur","it","out","the","connect","be","a","stretch","and","he","should","have","shoot","the","main","actress"],"filtered":["complet","wast","time","movi","start","clone","see","seri","even","wrong","act","melissa","joan","hart","absolut","horribl","end","ridicul","stori","contain","twist","plot","surpris","plain","bad","end","like","charact","hope","everyth","tie","togeth","end","doe","happen","total","wrestler","end","none","good","act","ca","believ","spend","time","watch","thi","fun","peopl","put","gui","mask","kidnap","peopl","connect","forc","figur","connect","stretch","shoot","main","actress"],"filtered2":["complet","wast","time","start","clone","see","even","wrong","act","melissa","joan","hart","absolut","horribl","end","ridicul","stori","contain","twist","plot","surpris","plain","bad","end","like","charact","hope","everyth","tie","togeth","end","doe","happen","total","wrestler","end","none","good","act","ca","believ","spend","time","watch","fun","peopl","put","gui","mask","kidnap","peopl","connect","forc","figur","connect","stretch","shoot","main","actress"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,8,9,10,17,18,21,23,24,25,32,55,71,81,89,91,94,103,117,159,179,181,184,193,222,230,259,270,274,283,326,338,355,370,415,435,586,711,767,1175,1220,1340,1370,1935,2807,3432,4274,4352],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,7,8,9,10,17,18,21,23,24,25,32,55,71,81,89,91,94,103,117,159,179,181,184,193,222,230,259,270,274,283,326,338,355,370,415,435,586,711,767,1175,1220,1340,1370,1935,2807,3432,4274,4352],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,2.324031090670098,2.729695454751562,5.284144626447703,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.9536997889255368,1.9214926742550966,1.949757232424728,1.9940046109572438,2.0105926690411424,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,2.2797301185117202,2.300267965194495,2.507968722980095,2.4442286541160034,2.496249838866882,2.517840471459249,2.5771019354959765,2.7121382192999195,2.7464553122240485,2.731603554088023,2.748952192422636,2.7678802023081546,2.942840385588056,2.9720957437368454,3.0316467233633775,2.9958122703541616,3.1588018988486244,3.2829611516442836,3.4572130107926293,3.6375061693251913,7.5833136983049,4.263079925052412,4.30366520516749,4.5432147918688095,4.520909034354511,5.408212229355414,5.408212229355414,5.999576715605417,6.1754673820690815,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0481646893745142E-4,2.0463497070976404E-4,2.0468549666480024E-4,2.0464434833266997E-4,2.046637154928044E-4,2.046338424142703E-4,2.0469748638025668E-4,2.0460339623606905E-4,2.0463501395727316E-4,2.0484648206987074E-4,2.0647187928241826E-4,2.0463535196139907E-4,2.0482915457133743E-4,2.0485049423537836E-4,2.0475743600462687E-4,2.0464515439713886E-4,2.0471556024485936E-4,2.04811900083488E-4,2.0465571934409382E-4,2.0465497110247865E-4,2.048390893597215E-4,2.046754754412126E-4,2.0467578519980695E-4,2.0480690269923516E-4,2.0465579316856505E-4,2.048529427044046E-4,2.047070074884349E-4,2.0463451208033382E-4,2.0472728462307016E-4,2.0478977034141496E-4,2.0467647940754566E-4,2.0478609967276753E-4,2.0488664453525873E-4,2.0507681111083857E-4,2.0470665374897087E-4,2.046450302766086E-4,2.0471881636714291E-4,2.046658138904978E-4,2.0460361461226788E-4,2.0465565596554795E-4,2.048607559064066E-4,2.0474837688640182E-4,2.0478656634500484E-4,2.04613797711329E-4,2.0465570800429678E-4,2.046449533222637E-4,2.0471422378351433E-4,2.0474972148578998E-4,2.0470808678692257E-4,2.0467564019349896E-4,2.0464545939350817E-4,2.0506474470589797E-4,2.0469695408604997E-4,2.0465566109746834E-4,2.046958578580454E-4,2.0463472144925806E-4,0.9838262975206153,2.046666478831401E-4,2.046457466895403E-4,2.046346046385405E-4,2.0479831723105383E-4,2.0471610605268098E-4,2.0463451909590266E-4,2.046137143470409E-4,2.04593138177864E-4,2.0477812276154753E-4,2.0464454399310726E-4

{"value":"Well, I was excited at first to download an animated open source movie, only to be ruined by a demo reel. The animation is excellent, the lip syncing is awful, and you keep watching the movie hoping to understand what's going on, only to realize nothing is going on. You feel no emotion for the characters, only pity for the creators for wasting their time. I have seen short films with twice the emotion in half the time! This could of been an excellent short film, if they had just taken the time to hire a real director. I'm sure everyone over at Blender is excited to showcase their software and its rendering capabilities, but sorry guys-story telling is what makes a movie.","finished_norm":["good","i","be","excit","at","to","download","a","anim","open","sourc","movi","onli","to","be","ruin","by","a","demo","reel","the","anim","be","excel","the","lip","sync","be","aw","and","you","keep","watch","the","movi","hope","to","understand","what","go","on","onli","to","realiz","noth","be","go","on","you","feel","no","emot","for","the","charact","onli","piti","for","the","creator","for","wast","their","time","i","have","see","short","film","with","twice","the","emot","in","half","the","time","thi","can","of","be","a","excel","short","film","if","thei","have","just","take","the","time","to","hire","a","real","director","i","be","sure","everyon","over","at","blender","be","excit","to","showcas","their","softwar","and","it","render","capabl","but","sorri","guysstori","tell","be","what","make","a","movi"],"filtered":["good","excit","download","anim","open","sourc","movi","onli","ruin","demo","reel","anim","excel","lip","sync","aw","keep","watch","movi","hope","understand","go","onli","realiz","noth","go","feel","emot","charact","onli","piti","creator","wast","time","see","short","film","twice","emot","half","time","thi","excel","short","film","thei","take","time","hire","real","director","sure","everyon","blender","excit","showcas","softwar","render","capabl","sorri","guysstori","tell","make","movi"],"filtered2":["good","excit","download","anim","open","sourc","onli","ruin","demo","reel","anim","excel","lip","sync","aw","keep","watch","hope","understand","go","onli","realiz","noth","go","feel","emot","charact","onli","piti","creator","wast","time","see","short","twice","emot","half","time","excel","short","take","time","hire","real","director","sure","everyon","blender","excit","showcas","softwar","render","capabl","sorri","guysstori","tell","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,8,10,11,31,43,49,58,80,89,90,119,134,138,181,206,212,242,246,272,277,405,437,506,524,580,710,1014,1255,1266,1536,1588,2088,2423,2443,2638,2901,4283,5825,5959],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,7,8,10,11,31,43,49,58,80,89,90,119,134,138,181,206,212,242,246,272,277,405,437,506,524,580,710,1014,1255,1266,1536,1588,2088,2423,2443,2638,2901,4283,5825,5959],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,2.825681057716235,1.1238870241028365,2.9739294460164585,1.4070669811451506,1.6608112036218214,1.6920303308087352,1.865701314626681,1.9951803900462557,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,2.1653408989309972,2.2443961816702407,2.2907365189289424,2.4442286541160034,2.597304642813496,2.5983793339432615,2.689504733779216,2.673149229007135,5.605761068896383,6.232798466686559,3.109204957709252,3.1952392950510555,6.899255278806746,6.8057573196586,7.007949553401337,3.6528204042982337,4.1302590120314875,4.291900363587903,4.327618446189983,4.5432147918688095,4.654440426979034,5.00274712124725,5.185068678041204,5.185068678041204,5.339219357868463,5.3560264761848435,6.032366538428407,6.389041482367141,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.234407602816466E-4,2.2324275812784212E-4,2.2329787848933362E-4,2.232529884731E-4,2.2327411672029316E-4,2.232415272346222E-4,2.23310958448924E-4,2.2320831253640848E-4,2.2324280530791688E-4,2.2347350255652807E-4,2.252466997550512E-4,2.2324317404730224E-4,2.2345459944065E-4,2.2347787955470622E-4,2.233763593891773E-4,2.232538678343091E-4,2.2333067579914003E-4,2.2343577597443485E-4,2.232653934689038E-4,2.2326457718847365E-4,2.234654376153402E-4,2.232869460197476E-4,2.2328728394518973E-4,2.2343032416998444E-4,2.232654740063531E-4,2.234805506669639E-4,2.233213453268011E-4,2.2324225779449925E-4,2.2334346629394172E-4,2.2341163393927875E-4,2.2328804127835604E-4,2.234076294908202E-4,2.2351731705956893E-4,2.2372477578809868E-4,2.2332095942123793E-4,2.2325373242729915E-4,2.2333422800586628E-4,2.2327640592866794E-4,2.2320855076990673E-4,2.232653243272447E-4,2.2348907433600583E-4,2.2336647651074383E-4,2.2340813859831555E-4,2.2321965983456367E-4,2.2326538109796075E-4,2.232536484753717E-4,2.2332921781121275E-4,2.233679433767196E-4,2.2332252276763826E-4,2.2328712575322467E-4,2.2325420056448943E-4,2.2371161216552582E-4,2.233103777523479E-4,2.2326532992581887E-4,2.2330918184256557E-4,2.2324248620167692E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.232773157576042E-4,2.2325451398481238E-4,2.232423587691727E-4,2.2342095801135587E-4,2.2333127123814583E-4,2.2324226544800506E-4,2.2321956888982666E-4,2.2319712169645186E-4,2.2339892722621744E-4,2.2325320192525595E-4,2.2335468452716262E-4,2.2342023346478727E-4,2.2331887205251035E-4,2.232656256333523E-4,2.232198615158069E-4,2.2327696528065538E-4,2.2321974128682484E-4,2.2323145549784637E-4,2.2321986783348534E-4,2.2336476872051287E-4,2.2329828821719062E-4,2.2324256341896753E-4,2.232641

{"value":"I just saw this at the 2006 Vancouver international film festival. The synopsis in the festival guide sounded pretty good so we decided to check this one out. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Besides being poorly written, it was boring. I won't take away from the actors as there is not much they could do with this bad script.<br /><br />First bite was cliché without being ironic, over the top seriousness without being funny. The movie would have been better had Hunt Hoe went with a campy horror feel. Instead he took himself to seriously and this resulted with a boring film. I can't recommend this film. It felt too long and all in all just plain weak.","finished_norm":["i","just","see","thi","at","the","vancouv","intern","film","festiv","the","synopsi","in","the","festiv","guid","sound","pretti","good","so","we","decid","to","check","thi","on","out","i","be","sorri","to","sai","i","be","veri","disappointedbr","br","besid","be","poorli","write","it","be","bore","i","wo","not","take","awai","from","the","actor","a","there","be","not","much","thei","can","do","with","thi","bad","scriptbr","br","bite","be","cliché","without","be","iron","over","the","top","serious","without","be","funni","the","movi","would","have","be","well","have","hunt","hoe","go","with","a","campi","horror","feel","instead","he","take","himself","to","serious","and","thi","result","with","a","bore","film","i","ca","not","recommend","thi","film","it","feel","too","long","and","all","in","all","just","plain","weak"],"filtered":["see","thi","vancouv","intern","film","festiv","synopsi","festiv","guid","sound","pretti","good","decid","check","thi","sorri","sai","veri","disappointedbr","br","besid","poorli","write","bore","wo","take","awai","actor","much","thei","thi","bad","scriptbr","br","bite","cliché","without","iron","top","serious","without","funni","movi","well","hunt","hoe","go","campi","horror","feel","instead","take","serious","thi","result","bore","film","ca","recommend","thi","film","feel","long","plain","weak"],"filtered2":["see","vancouv","intern","festiv","synopsi","festiv","guid","sound","pretti","good","decid","check","sorri","veri","disappointedbr","besid","poorli","write","bore","wo","take","awai","actor","bad","scriptbr","bite","cliché","without","iron","top","serious","without","funni","well","hunt","hoe","go","campi","horror","feel","instead","take","serious","result","bore","ca","recommend","feel","long","plain","weak"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,9,15,20,31,41,43,62,65,78,81,83,99,108,125,152,154,155,178,249,298,364,371,379,398,406,437,447,505,523,586,972,1217,1246,1249,1381,1734,2460,2557,3567,3661,7227],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,6,9,15,20,31,41,43,62,65,78,81,83,99,108,125,152,154,155,178,249,298,364,371,379,398,406,437,447,505,523,586,972,1217,1246,1249,1381,1734,2460,2557,3567,3661,7227],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,2.814133962290301,1.5687599167621034,3.321622407243643,2.0226120445069267,1.9073850067444174,2.0064197866819473,1.949757232424728,2.292318797740072,2.056430207256609,4.277015007255866,4.448447326975307,2.3131195476980753,2.348499626138016,2.3074766467914385,2.532833256045391,2.6754694156628323,2.7819920465008363,2.9878441007049847,6.093369201455837,3.1272886331425473,3.143848349181566,3.121829110937649,3.1952392950510555,3.2070272508030975,3.41740676039221,3.4986697244709752,3.4572130107926293,3.9911462095687695,8.955473724978605,4.315570107673808,4.390138803171316,4.449957298382227,4.798834931860927,5.156897801074508,5.2288713006995975,5.649374286172302,5.672363804397,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.409702074900609E-4,2.4075667160687825E-4,2.4081611628889952E-4,2.4076770454651013E-4,2.4079049035382488E-4,2.4075534414722306E-4,2.4083022240173444E-4,2.407195236787007E-4,2.407567224883396E-4,2.4100551847254208E-4,2.429178271144851E-4,2.4075712015618716E-4,2.4098513236326814E-4,2.4101023885640508E-4,2.4090075419782672E-4,2.4076865289565086E-4,2.4085148662392346E-4,2.4096483215235845E-4,2.4078108274307994E-4,2.4078020242355194E-4,2.409968208179647E-4,2.4080432614165332E-4,2.4080469057813218E-4,2.4095895264117189E-4,2.407811695988794E-4,2.4101311952363049E-4,2.408414241543335E-4,2.4075613202122122E-4,2.4086528056278396E-4,2.4093879611840715E-4,2.408055073258464E-4,2.409344775116555E-4,2.4105277032522785E-4,2.4127650467341226E-4,2.4084100797358156E-4,2.407685068656461E-4,2.408553175095273E-4,2.407929591559197E-4,2.4071978060217082E-4,2.4078100817709688E-4,2.4102231189432875E-4,2.408900959845996E-4,2.409350265598177E-4,2.407317611987819E-4,2.4078106940160764E-4,2.4076841632749476E-4,2.4084991425345304E-4,2.4089167792962202E-4,2.4084269396814224E-4,2.408045199756396E-4,2.4076901172928752E-4,2.4126230833403933E-4,2.4082959614816167E-4,2.4078101421489223E-4,2.4082830641647607E-4,2.407563783474731E-4,0.9809713522425287,2.4079394036305164E-4,2.4076934973816359E-4,2.407562409175926E-4,2.4094885168561987E-4,2.4085212877650381E-4,2.4075614027516237E-4,2.407316631192188E-4,2.4070745489132754E-4,2.4092509253415939E-4,2.4076793474448404E-4,2.4087737889248663E-4,2.409480702966882E-4,2.4083875684592358E-4,2.4078133312136925E-4,2.407319787023876E-4,2.4079356239037122E-4,2.4073184904116235E-4,2.4074448225927747E-4,2.4073198551570262E-4,2.4088825421425392E-4,2.4081655816085966E-4,2.407564616226397E-4,2.407797833994224

{"value":"I was so disappointed by this show.

As for any hint of the vaunted \"look into teenagers' lives\", I could only see a paltry attempt that had as much reality to it as a reality show.<br /><br />Some are wondering why there are so many negative comments about this show. The reason is that it's really not all that good and beating the drums over quality on this show only serves to attract attention to how poorly made it is.","finished_norm":["i","be","so","disappoint","by","thi","show","after","hear","and","read","all","the","hoopla","about","it","how","it","be","a","grind","break","show","and","all","sort","of","wild","promis","if","qualiti","i","try","to","watch","itbr","br","what","a","letdown","the","act","be","wai","forc","and","exagger","the","stori","make","veri","littl","sens","a","for","ani","hint","of","the","vaunt","look","into","teenag","live","i","can","onli","see","a","paltri","attempt","that","have","a","much","realiti","to","it","a","a","realiti","showbr","br","some","be","wonder","why","there","be","so","mani","neg","comment","about","thi","show","the","reason","be","that","it","realli","not","all","that","good","and","beat","the","drum","over","qualiti","on","thi","show","onli","serv","to","attract","attent","to","how","poorli","make","it","be"],"filtered":["disappoint","thi","show","hear","read","hoopla","grind","break","show","sort","wild","promis","qualiti","try","watch","itbr","br","letdown","act","wai","forc","exagger","stori","make","veri","littl","sens","ani","hint","vaunt","look","teenag","live","onli","see","paltri","attempt","much","realiti","realiti","showbr","br","wonder","mani","neg","comment","thi","show","reason","realli","good","beat","drum","qualiti","thi","show","onli","serv","attract","attent","poorli","make"],"filtered2":["disappoint","show","hear","read","hoopla","grind","break","show","sort","wild","promis","qualiti","try","watch","itbr","letdown","act","wai","forc","exagger","stori","make","veri","littl","sens","ani","hint","vaunt","look","teenag","live","onli","see","paltri","attempt","realiti","realiti","showbr","wonder","mani","neg","comment","show","reason","realli","good","beat","drum","qualiti","show","onli","serv","attract","attent","poorli","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,11,13,14,15,16,17,21,27,28,33,36,50,95,116,145,173,175,177,187,216,269,280,319,338,360,398,430,636,648,656,678,683,693,815,1064,1107,1147,1303,2046,3251,3673,4376,7799],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,7,11,13,14,15,16,17,21,27,28,33,36,50,95,116,145,173,175,177,187,216,269,280,319,338,360,398,430,636,648,656,678,683,693,815,1064,1107,1147,1303,2046,3251,3673,4376,7799],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.982619630677639,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3002700588679295,6.180917677407637,1.4018535447685214,1.4680183469605717,1.717994385570355,2.0323326556775485,2.2466628996789315,2.34599021453259,2.4368824319140248,2.3791142619576227,2.458149992634611,2.4732161909892554,2.6070186965339692,2.76533567167316,2.8028805344481915,5.811212004936025,2.9720957437368454,3.028335462059722,3.143848349181566,3.1419947805322432,3.530930586689197,3.6105180246075443,7.36198256252986,3.6715125373103863,3.6105180246075443,3.753391311073496,3.7881170224473255,4.105687751300982,4.268777946167049,4.246178114249808,4.370968887063596,4.900964426937307,5.501738287366237,5.695894301807195,6.032366538428407,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2344076028164663E-4,2.2324275812784215E-4,2.2329787848933365E-4,2.2325298847310004E-4,2.2327411672029318E-4,2.2324152723462223E-4,2.2331095844892402E-4,2.232083125364085E-4,2.232428053079169E-4,2.234735025565281E-4,2.2524669976317925E-4,2.2324317404730226E-4,2.2345459944065002E-4,2.2347787955470625E-4,2.2337635938917736E-4,2.2325386783430913E-4,2.2333067579914006E-4,2.2343577597443487E-4,2.2326539346890383E-4,2.2326457718847367E-4,2.2346543761534024E-4,2.2328694601974762E-4,2.2328728394518975E-4,2.2343032416998447E-4,2.2326547400635313E-4,2.2348055066696393E-4,2.2332134532680113E-4,2.2324225779449928E-4,2.2334346629394175E-4,2.2341163393927878E-4,2.2328804127835607E-4,2.2340762949082024E-4,2.2351731705956896E-4,2.237247757880987E-4,2.2332095942123795E-4,2.2325373242729917E-4,2.233342280058663E-4,2.2327640592866797E-4,2.2320855076990675E-4,2.2326532432724472E-4,2.2348907433600586E-4,2.2336647651074386E-4,2.2340813859831558E-4,2.232196598345637E-4,2.232653810979608E-4,2.2325364847537173E-4,2.2332921781121278E-4,2.2336794337671963E-4,2.233225227676383E-4,2.232871257532247E-4,2.2325420056448946E-4,2.2371161216552584E-4,2.2331037775234793E-4,2.232653299258189E-4,2.233091818425656E-4,2.2324248620167694E-4,0.9823555967090315,2.2327731575760422E-4,2.232545139848124E-4,2.2324235876917275E-4,2.234209580113559E-4,2.2333127123814586E-4,2.232422654480051E-4,2.232195688898267E-4,2.231971216964519E-4,2.2339892722621747E-4,2.2325320192525597E-4,2.2335468452716264E-4,2.234202334647873E-4,2.2331887205251038E-4,2.2326562563335233E-4,2.2321986151580691E-4,2.232769652806554E-4,2.2321974128682487E-4,2.23231455497846

{"value":"The first half of this version was the best I've seen (and I think I've seen every version of Jane Eyre ever made). The development of Jane's childhood and character were exceptional. Then, it was as though someone said \"Uh oh, this is running too long,\" and hacked the rest of the story to shreds. The major scenes, when included at all, are glossed over, combined, and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline. There was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow. The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope, and then the end dashed it.","finished_norm":["the","half","of","thi","version","be","the","well","i","have","see","and","i","think","i","have","see","everi","version","of","jane","eyr","ever","make","the","develop","of","jane","childhood","and","charact","be","except","then","it","be","a","though","someon","sai","uh","oh","thi","be","run","too","long","and","hack","the","rest","of","the","stori","to","shred","the","major","scene","when","includ","at","all","be","gloss","over","combin","and","put","out","of","order","in","such","a","wai","that","thei","complet","chang","the","storylin","there","be","so","littl","transit","or","even","scene","develop","that","it","would","be","difficult","for","anyon","not","familiar","with","the","stori","even","to","follow","the","big","disappoint","be","that","the","begin","open","so","much","hope","and","then","the","end","dash","it"],"filtered":["half","thi","version","well","see","think","see","everi","version","jane","eyr","ever","make","develop","jane","childhood","charact","except","though","someon","sai","uh","oh","thi","run","long","hack","rest","stori","shred","major","scene","includ","gloss","combin","put","order","wai","thei","complet","chang","storylin","littl","transit","even","scene","develop","difficult","anyon","familiar","stori","even","follow","big","disappoint","begin","open","much","hope","end","dash"],"filtered2":["half","version","well","see","think","see","everi","version","jane","eyr","ever","make","develop","jane","childhood","charact","except","though","someon","uh","oh","run","long","hack","rest","stori","shred","major","scene","includ","gloss","combin","put","order","wai","complet","chang","storylin","littl","transit","even","scene","develop","difficult","anyon","familiar","stori","even","follow","big","disappoint","begin","open","hope","end","dash"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,10,12,14,17,19,20,24,33,44,82,85,86,99,103,137,139,147,158,159,181,187,206,220,226,232,234,242,260,278,301,320,404,439,515,803,968,1067,1095,1885,1902,2976,3022,3225,3711,4238,6444],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,10,12,14,17,19,20,24,33,44,82,85,86,99,103,137,139,147,158,159,181,187,206,220,226,232,234,242,260,278,301,320,404,439,515,803,968,1067,1095,1885,1902,2976,3022,3225,3711,4238,6444],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,1.852034211452262,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,2.5541073880211935,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,1.3210361566119257,1.4018535447685214,1.604729392502474,2.020196584395323,2.011190219103739,2.031112399272319,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.2939035841256437,2.2939035841256437,2.2844323215331563,2.3106972614914807,2.300267965194495,2.4442286541160034,2.4732161909892554,2.597304642813496,5.667386841755453,2.5940874818617203,2.6102777977348763,2.673149229007135,2.689504733779216,2.6754694156628323,2.8336934208777267,2.8309760279012264,5.87659672830711,3.1419947805322432,3.2872346624216657,3.3956930001684253,3.7636829971100436,3.9911462095687695,9.48443207572284,4.1554492608600455,4.85885294158718,4.85885294158718,5.408212229355414,5.444579873526289,5.541743621979936,5.7959777603641776,6.489124940924123,6.489124940924123]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247373E-4,2.1540780663324E-4,2.154609924846839E-4,2.1541767793321667E-4,2.1543806466120755E-4,2.1540661893957894E-4,2.154736133886265E-4,2.1537456994793322E-4,2.1540785215747783E-4,2.1563045283100655E-4,2.1734141772263374E-4,2.1540820795554666E-4,2.1561221314088632E-4,2.1563467621359283E-4,2.1553671901055065E-4,2.154185264322716E-4,2.1549263873663006E-4,2.1559405030503607E-4,2.1542964756197328E-4,2.1542885992980758E-4,2.1562267093784917E-4,2.154504437022089E-4,2.1545076976778392E-4,2.1558878983769233E-4,2.154297252728717E-4,2.1563725358021167E-4,2.15483635727537E-4,2.1540732385964915E-4,2.155049803348709E-4,2.1557075556130395E-4,2.1545150052150515E-4,2.1556689165339282E-4,2.1567272961560597E-4,2.1587290735061642E-4,2.1548326336575638E-4,2.1541839577752042E-4,2.1549606627473263E-4,2.1544027352728262E-4,2.153747998203634E-4,2.1542958084691717E-4,2.156454781016617E-4,2.1552718298266588E-4,2.1556738289319757E-4,2.1538551900011E-4,2.1542963562520216E-4,2.154183147719787E-4,2.1549123191840156E-4,2.1552859836735793E-4,2.1548477184478578E-4,2.154506171277408E-4,2.1541884748491825E-4,2.158602057199362E-4,2.1547305307223897E-4,2.1542958624900317E-4,2.154718991342331E-4,2.154075442506243E-4,0.9829748465565732,2.1544115142476614E-4,2.1541914990540835E-4,2.1540742129050477E-4,2.1557975239475943E-4,2.154932132780454E-4,2.154073312445467E-4,2.153854312471791E-4,2.1536377186288157E-4,2.1555849480439068E-4,2.1541788389403313E-4,2.1551580485178992E-4,2.15579053276954E-4,2.1548124925554286E-4,2.1542987157835368E-4,2.153857136031269

{"value":"How do I begin? This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen .It has no redeemable qualities .I just sat through this movie and it was a struggle.It failed to get even a single smile on my face.I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film. I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor. The only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack, I'm pretty sure thats the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place.I will wrap this up as I am going to try and forget the time I just wasted with this piece of crap.

{"value":"Bad plot (though good for a B-movie), good fast-paced fight scenes, at most a 5 out of 10. But something has always bothered me about this film: how come Mariska Hargitay never speaks? In the TV version, she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman, even a kiss in a garden. Yet in the regular (video) version, most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all. This bothers me because it not only takes out a female (though cliched) point-of-view to the film, it also makes the final shot seem creepy. This film would have been better had they kept her scenes in, because in those scenes at least she has a personality, one that undercuts whatever Speakman says.","finished_norm":["bad","plot","though","good","for","a","bmovi","good","fastpac","fight","scene","at","much","a","out","of","but","someth","have","alwai","bother","me","about","thi","film","how","come","mariska","hargitai","never","speak","in","the","tv","version","she","share","sever","intim","moment","with","jeff","speakman","even","a","kiss","in","a","garden","yet","in","the","regular","video","version","much","of","her","scene","be","cut","and","she","never","speak","at","all","thi","bother","me","becaus","it","not","onli","take","out","a","femal","though","clich","pointofview","to","the","film","it","conjur","make","the","final","shoot","seem","creepi","thi","film","would","have","be","well","have","thei","keep","her","scene","in","becaus","in","that","scene","at","littl","she","have","a","person","on","that","undercut","whatev","speakman","sai"],"filtered":["bad","plot","though","good","bmovi","good","fastpac","fight","scene","much","someth","alwai","bother","thi","film","come","mariska","hargitai","never","speak","tv","version","share","sever","intim","moment","jeff","speakman","even","kiss","garden","yet","regular","video","version","much","scene","cut","never","speak","thi","bother","becaus","onli","take","femal","though","clich","pointofview","film","conjur","make","final","shoot","seem","creepi","thi","film","well","thei","keep","scene","becaus","scene","littl","person","undercut","whatev","speakman","sai"],"filtered2":["bad","plot","though","good","bmovi","good","fastpac","fight","scene","someth","alwai","bother","come","mariska","hargitai","never","speak","tv","version","share","sever","intim","moment","jeff","speakman","even","kiss","garden","yet","regular","video","version","scene","cut","never","speak","bother","becaus","onli","take","femal","though","clich","pointofview","conjur","make","final","shoot","seem","creepi","well","keep","scene","becaus","scene","littl","person","undercut","whatev","speakman"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,9,11,14,19,20,22,31,32,34,35,39,42,53,86,117,134,153,156,172,188,194,197,220,233,240,303,316,344,422,496,557,755,1124,1286,1461,1581,1759,1869,2337,4913,6213,7147],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,9,11,14,19,20,22,31,32,34,35,39,42,53,86,117,134,153,156,172,188,194,197,220,233,240,303,316,344,422,496,557,755,1124,1286,1461,1581,1759,1869,2337,4913,6213,7147],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,5.24952271204694,1.165345040023057,2.5958480334723544,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,3.2439908614907673,1.7003182735607676,4.062224798544638,2.2797301185117202,2.2443961816702407,2.3409902041158843,2.3451551414151686,2.5001408943598484,2.5378812223426954,2.5378812223426954,2.558331832813986,5.667386841755453,2.8377834061292515,2.7666071276613566,2.868298950055202,2.878207028279898,5.966186995892774,3.2090054908152035,6.587358735728616,3.4471119148061256,3.79165684915245,4.181290492043933,4.499089986959872,4.6295428753573065,4.671389985292807,4.751432692966343,4.979216623837056,5.214056214914456,6.101359409915359,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805344E-4,2.1925531043720585E-4,2.1930944626706022E-4,2.1926535805328178E-4,2.1928610891855588E-4,2.1925410152956955E-4,2.193222925991184E-4,2.1922148009526638E-4,2.192553567745743E-4,2.1948193342720773E-4,2.2122345868647698E-4,2.1925571892772582E-4,2.1946336794909395E-4,2.1948623224568847E-4,2.1938652538130754E-4,2.192662217077918E-4,2.1934165776813384E-4,2.194448806979817E-4,2.192775414774105E-4,2.1927673977696285E-4,2.194740125378645E-4,2.1929870906764096E-4,2.192990409572321E-4,2.1943952627086726E-4,2.1927762057634114E-4,2.1948885564790848E-4,2.1933249395190814E-4,2.1925481904056063E-4,2.19354219805675E-4,2.1942116987548008E-4,2.1929978476330165E-4,2.1941723695242685E-4,2.1952496533805864E-4,2.197287185451421E-4,2.193321149391923E-4,2.1926608871935242E-4,2.1934514652716475E-4,2.1928835723826433E-4,2.1922171407356001E-4,2.1927747357072423E-4,2.1949722707154397E-4,2.1937681902578176E-4,2.1941773696650515E-4,2.192326247137996E-4,2.1927752932743088E-4,2.1926600626693128E-4,2.1934022582203942E-4,2.193782596913495E-4,2.1933365036190075E-4,2.192988855908108E-4,2.1926654849491623E-4,2.1971579004444674E-4,2.1932172227464683E-4,2.1927747906929957E-4,2.1932054772559189E-4,2.1925504336804642E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.192892508163026E-4,2.1926685631708606E-4,2.1925491821167626E-4,2.1943032740576215E-4,2.1934224257171337E-4,2.1925482655736346E-4,2.1923253539347085E-4,2.1921048914035562E-4,2.1940869012321285E-4,2.1926556769286476E-4,2.1936523766456558E-4,2.194296158006729E-4,2.1933006485397476E-4,2.192777694

{"value":"I am watching this movie right now on WTN because that was the channel that the TV was turned to when I turned it on. It is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a minister's wife (Alexandra Paul) falling in lust with a young stud/drifter (with washboard abs) played by Corey Sevier. There may or may not be a plot. Corey whips his shirt off a lot and Alexandra swoons. I'm getting the feeling he's supposed to be up to no good, and that's why he's messing with skinny Alexandra Paul. It's not really important because as I said he takes his shirt off a lot and I just caught a glimpse of butt cleavage. There's a lot of sax on the soundtrack, which is just painful.","finished_norm":["i","be","watch","thi","movi","right","now","on","wtn","becaus","that","be","the","channel","that","the","tv","be","turn","to","when","i","turn","it","on","it","be","a","not","veri","credibl","and","fairli","bore","stori","about","a","minist","wife","alexandra","paul","fall","in","lust","with","a","young","studdrift","with","washboard","ab","plai","by","corei","sevier","there","mai","or","mai","not","be","a","plot","corei","whip","hi","shirt","off","a","lot","and","alexandra","swoon","i","be","get","the","feel","he","suppos","to","be","up","to","no","good","and","that","why","he","mess","with","skinni","alexandra","paul","it","not","realli","import","becaus","a","i","sai","he","take","hi","shirt","off","a","lot","and","i","just","catch","a","glimps","of","butt","cleavag","there","a","lot","of","sax","on","the","soundtrack","which","be","just","pain"],"filtered":["watch","thi","movi","right","wtn","becaus","channel","tv","turn","turn","veri","credibl","fairli","bore","stori","minist","wife","alexandra","paul","fall","lust","young","studdrift","washboard","ab","plai","corei","sevier","mai","mai","plot","corei","whip","hi","shirt","lot","alexandra","swoon","get","feel","suppos","good","mess","skinni","alexandra","paul","realli","import","becaus","sai","take","hi","shirt","lot","catch","glimps","butt","cleavag","lot","sax","soundtrack","pain"],"filtered2":["watch","right","wtn","becaus","channel","tv","turn","turn","veri","credibl","fairli","bore","stori","minist","wife","alexandra","paul","fall","lust","young","studdrift","washboard","ab","plai","corei","sevier","mai","mai","plot","corei","whip","shirt","lot","alexandra","swoon","get","feel","suppos","good","mess","skinni","alexandra","paul","realli","import","becaus","take","shirt","lot","catch","glimps","butt","cleavag","lot","sax","soundtrack","pain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,13,15,17,22,31,32,40,43,46,72,96,108,121,135,149,169,172,263,407,458,512,600,728,796,819,840,1207,2403,2436,2665,3092,3188,4305,4323,4794,6438,6543,6751],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,4,7,13,15,17,22,31,32,40,43,46,72,96,108,121,135,149,169,172,263,407,458,512,600,728,796,819,840,1207,2403,2436,2665,3092,3188,4305,4323,4794,6438,6543,6751],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,2.5958480334723544,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.6284968758320737,1.6608112036218214,3.311542587503466,5.762839126248157,4.078141625743051,2.138507503627933,2.2190595059394194,2.366244071437088,2.3253197803590226,2.4071371113909277,2.5001408943598484,2.902686292364678,3.120015873813468,3.2829611516442836,3.369778711402955,3.558633189238533,3.7740817043309423,3.850067611308864,3.835141961092188,8.098137714602949,4.297765483040301,5.0768550934009715,5.116075806554253,10.926544013076883,5.482320201509136,5.604922523601468,5.9370563586240825,12.875663293073144,6.1754673820690815,19.982925593552345,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918335E-4,2.3612552253122047E-4,2.3618382374676017E-4,2.361363432433455E-4,2.3615869074724883E-4,2.3612422060632413E-4,2.3619765851711898E-4,2.3608908917345167E-4,2.361255724339358E-4,2.3636958262639022E-4,2.3824510646673088E-4,2.3612596245232105E-4,2.3634958866039727E-4,2.3637421220985624E-4,2.3626683357713373E-4,2.3613727335022435E-4,2.3621851370481573E-4,2.3632967894044411E-4,2.3614946409949658E-4,2.3614860071362589E-4,2.3636105227822513E-4,2.3617226039252104E-4,2.3617261781876982E-4,2.3632391252640503E-4,2.3614954928455456E-4,2.3637703746512038E-4,2.3620864479495738E-4,2.3612499332492946E-4,2.362320423061187E-4,2.363041437306393E-4,2.361734188556819E-4,2.3629990819577735E-4,2.364159255515168E-4,2.366353561887682E-4,2.3620823661977842E-4,2.361371301292247E-4,2.3622227090024016E-4,2.3616111205994095E-4,2.360893411547913E-4,2.3614939096785047E-4,2.3638605301314213E-4,2.3625638038324835E-4,2.363004466825546E-4,2.3610109129494796E-4,2.361494510146583E-4,2.3613704133264784E-4,2.3621697158016157E-4,2.362579318982803E-4,2.3620989018287164E-4,2.3617245049795398E-4,2.361376252814061E-4,2.3662143292745174E-4,2.361970443100396E-4,2.3614939688950393E-4,2.361957793873849E-4,2.361252349128969E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.36162074392761E-4,2.361379567884084E-4,2.361251001265912E-4,2.363140058708932E-4,2.3621914350507243E-4,2.361250014200994E-4,2.3610099510202448E-4,2.3607725253895354E-4,2.362907037459051E-4,2.361365690132754E-4,2.362439079146758E-4,2.363132395126089E-4,2.3620602879437951E-4,2.3614970966155723E-4,2.3610130461469608E-4,2.3616170369069044E-4,2.3610117744760924E-4,2.3611356765556807E-4,2.361013112969515E-4,2.3625457404084316E-4,2.3618425711895619E-4,2.361253165861984E-4,2.3614818974976407E-4]}}
{"value":"This movie wasn't awful but it wasn't very good. I am a big fan Toni Collette I think she is a very beautiful and talented actress. The movie starts off about Robin Williams who is a writer and gets a book from a 14 year old kid. The book is great and he cant't believe a kid wrote it. Toni Collette plays the kids guardian who you don't know if this kid really exists or if she's making it all up. I am not gonna ruin the movie but I will say this the movie is not scary.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good and Toni Collette's performance was awesome as well as Robin Williams. <br /><br />The movie was a huge disappointment in my opinion I would wait for it to come to DVD.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","not","aw","but","it","be","not","veri","good","i","be","a","big","fan","toni","collett","i","think","she","be","a","veri","beauti","and","talent","actress","the","movi","start","off","about","robin","william","who","be","a","writer","and","get","a","book","from","a","year","old","kid","the","book","be","great","and","he","cant","t","believ","a","kid","write","it","toni","collett","plai","the","kid","guardian","who","you","do","not","know","if","thi","kid","realli","exist","or","if","she","make","it","all","up","i","be","not","gonna","ruin","the","movi","but","i","will","sai","thi","the","movi","be","not","scarybr","br","the","act","be","pretti","good","and","toni","collett","perform","be","awesom","a","good","a","robin","william","br","br","the","movi","be","a","huge","disappoint","in","my","opinion","i","would","wait","for","it","to","come","to","dvd"],"filtered":["thi","movi","aw","veri","good","big","fan","toni","collett","think","veri","beauti","talent","actress","movi","start","robin","william","writer","get","book","year","old","kid","book","great","cant","believ","kid","write","toni","collett","plai","kid","guardian","know","thi","kid","realli","exist","make","gonna","ruin","movi","sai","thi","movi","scarybr","br","act","pretti","good","toni","collett","perform","awesom","good","robin","william","br","br","movi","huge","disappoint","opinion","wait","come","dvd"],"filtered2":["aw","veri","good","big","fan","toni","collett","think","veri","beauti","talent","actress","start","robin","william","writer","get","book","year","old","kid","book","great","cant","believ","kid","write","toni","collett","plai","kid","guardian","know","kid","realli","exist","make","gonna","ruin","scarybr","act","pretti","good","toni","collett","perform","awesom","good","robin","william","huge","disappoint","opinion","wait","come","dvd"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,12,13,15,21,26,34,40,51,57,65,67,71,78,82,91,105,114,138,140,151,187,247,276,287,325,331,355,444,528,538,710,720,1351,1455,1456,1627,1679,5778,5955,7252],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,12,13,15,21,26,34,40,51,57,65,67,71,78,82,91,105,114,138,140,151,187,247,276,287,325,331,355,444,528,538,710,720,1351,1455,1456,1627,1679,5778,5955,7252],"values":[0.6199767156205233,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.4001215597131385,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,1.7139899308309823,1.834162586674748,1.9073850067444174,1.9570915389266579,1.9214926742550966,2.0064197866819473,2.020196584395323,2.0105926690411424,2.1765612129984904,9.77322967838673,2.2907365189289424,2.317169775997098,5.6004909736203725,2.4732161909892554,2.7303758068497004,2.7884729505849193,2.841890188081905,2.973659465713028,2.932274249550174,3.0316467233633775,3.2535472664379905,3.4198487640477615,3.43462735814388,3.6528204042982337,7.715229633888494,4.436351646326448,4.637773374493822,14.425773320418877,9.889855100716847,4.706176101378222,6.342521466732247,6.389041482367141,21.10700594187658]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247373E-4,2.1540780663324E-4,2.154609924846839E-4,2.1541767793321667E-4,2.1543806466120755E-4,2.1540661893957894E-4,2.154736133886265E-4,2.1537456994793322E-4,2.1540785215747783E-4,2.1563045283100655E-4,2.1734141771275798E-4,2.1540820795554666E-4,2.1561221314088632E-4,2.1563467621359283E-4,2.1553671901055065E-4,2.154185264322716E-4,2.1549263873663006E-4,2.1559405030503607E-4,2.1542964756197328E-4,2.1542885992980758E-4,2.1562267093784917E-4,2.154504437022089E-4,2.1545076976778392E-4,2.1558878983769233E-4,2.154297252728717E-4,2.1563725358021167E-4,0.10210828492376472,2.1540732385964915E-4,2.155049803348709E-4,2.1557075556130395E-4,2.1545150052150515E-4,2.1556689165339282E-4,2.1567272961560597E-4,2.1587290735061642E-4,2.1548326336575638E-4,2.1541839577752042E-4,2.1549606627473263E-4,2.1544027352728262E-4,2.153747998203634E-4,2.1542958084691717E-4,2.156454781016617E-4,2.1552718298266588E-4,2.1556738289319757E-4,2.1538551900011E-4,2.1542963562520216E-4,2.154183147719787E-4,2.1549123191840156E-4,2.1552859836735793E-4,2.1548477184478578E-4,2.154506171277408E-4,2.1541884748491825E-4,2.158602057199362E-4,2.1547305307223897E-4,2.1542958624900317E-4,2.154718991342331E-4,2.154075442506243E-4,0.8810820452685459,2.1544115142476614E-4,2.1541914990540835E-4,2.1540742129050477E-4,2.1557975239475943E-4,2.154932132780454E-4,2.154073312445467E-4,2.153854312471791E-4,2.1536377186288157E-4,2.1555849480439068E-4,2.1541788389403313E-4,2.1551580485178992E-4,2.15579053276954E-4,2.1548124925554286E-4,2.1542987157835368E-4,2.1538571360312693E-4,2.1544081324819343E-4,2.1538559759371397E-4,2.1539690068154424E-4,2.1538571969907945E-4,2.1552553512922185E-4,2.15

{"value":"For the love of god please don't see this movie! Its a waste of time, the plot is predictable, as are the romantic scenes. Trying to build too much with very little, this film and its evil predictable villain is just lame. The characters aren't developed, and most of the film is padded out with shots of Rome, which is much more interesting than the actual film. To top all of that, the acting is a disgrace. I know everyone tries to find their niche, but this is truly a disaster. I can't believe that someone actually paid however many millions of pounds to put this film on screen. Don't waste money or time on this film, go see your grandma or something worthwhile
