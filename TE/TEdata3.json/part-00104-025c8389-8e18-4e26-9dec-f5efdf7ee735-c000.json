{"value":"R Balki tries to tell you a story that had been earlier told by Ram Gopal Verma in Nishabd in a sensuous way. This time it is mixed with mature humors.<br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan is a Chef and owns an Indian Cuisine in London. He is very dominating and arrogant and respects his job just like any other job. According to him, Cooking is an art. Still cannot make Hyderabadi Biryani properly.<br /><br />Enter Tabu who sends her the proper Hyderabadi Biryani made by her and they soon starts meeting up and finally falls in love with each other Amitabh is 65 and Tabu is 35. No probs! But one Hitch! Tabu's father Paresh Rawal!! The couples decide to meet the father for the approval of their marriage. But Amitabh realizes that Tabu's father is much younger to him. And the complications begin Performance wise all three actors are brilliant. The script of the film is very tight and interesting. The dialogues of the film are catchy. But somewhere you feel that your stomach is not properly filled. The comedy is sometimes not properly understood. The film also tries to go lengthy at some parts.<br /><br />Musically nothing much to sing about except the Title Track. The camera-work is good. Director R Balki could have given much better from this script. But in the second half he himself looks confused. The \"Satyagrah\" scene of the father looked irritating. But the lines spoken by Amitabh Bachchan during that scene are clap worthy.<br /><br />On the whole, Cheeni Kum needed to have more sugar!","finished_norm":["r","balki","try","to","tell","you","a","stori","that","have","be","earli","tell","by","ram","gopal","verma","in","nishabd","in","a","sensuou","wai","thi","time","it","be","mix","with","matur","humorsbr","br","amitabh","bachchan","be","a","chef","and","own","a","indian","cuisin","in","london","he","be","veri","domin","and","arrog","and","respect","hi","job","just","like","ani","other","job","accord","to","him","cook","be","a","art","still","cannot","make","hyderabadi","biryani","properlybr","br","enter","tabu","who","send","her","the","proper","hyderabadi","biryani","make","by","her","and","thei","soon","start","meet","up","and","final","fall","in","love","with","each","other","amitabh","be","and","tabu","be","no","prob","but","on","hitch","tabu","father","paresh","rawal","the","coupl","decid","to","meet","the","father","for","the","approv","of","their","marriag","but","amitabh","realiz","that","tabu","father","be","much","young","to","him","and","the","complic","begin","perform","wise","all","three","actor","be","brilliant","the","script","of","the","film","be","veri","tight","and","interest","the","dialogu","of","the","film","be","catchi","but","somewher","you","feel","that","your","stomach","be","not","properli","fill","the","comedi","be","sometim","not","properli","understand","the","film","conjur","try","to","go","lengthi","at","some","partsbr","br","music","noth","much","to","sing","about","except","the","titl","track","the","camerawork","be","good","director","r","balki","can","have","give","much","well","from","thi","script","but","in","the","half","he","himself","look","confus","the","satyagrah","scene","of","the","father","look","irrit","but","the","line","speak","by","amitabh","bachchan","dure","that","scene","be","clap","worthybr","br","on","the","whole","cheeni","kum","ne","to","have","much","sugar"],"filtered":["r","balki","try","tell","stori","earli","tell","ram","gopal","verma","nishabd","sensuou","wai","thi","time","mix","matur","humorsbr","br","amitabh","bachchan","chef","indian","cuisin","london","veri","domin","arrog","respect","hi","job","like","ani","job","accord","cook","art","still","make","hyderabadi","biryani","properlybr","br","enter","tabu","send","proper","hyderabadi","biryani","make","thei","soon","start","meet","final","fall","love","amitabh","tabu","prob","hitch","tabu","father","paresh","rawal","coupl","decid","meet","father","approv","marriag","amitabh","realiz","tabu","father","much","young","complic","begin","perform","wise","three","actor","brilliant","script","film","veri","tight","interest","dialogu","film","catchi","somewher","feel","stomach","properli","fill","comedi","sometim","properli","understand","film","conjur","try","go","lengthi","partsbr","br","music","noth","much","sing","except","titl","track","camerawork","good","director","r","balki","give","much","well","thi","script","half","look","confus","satyagrah","scene","father","look","irrit","line","speak","amitabh","bachchan","dure","scene","clap","worthybr","br","whole","cheeni","kum","ne","much","sugar"],"filtered2":["r","balki","try","tell","stori","earli","tell","ram","gopal","verma","nishabd","sensuou","wai","time","mix","matur","humorsbr","amitabh","bachchan","chef","indian","cuisin","london","veri","domin","arrog","respect","job","like","ani","job","accord","cook","art","still","make","hyderabadi","biryani","properlybr","enter","tabu","send","proper","hyderabadi","biryani","make","soon","start","meet","final","fall","love","amitabh","tabu","prob","hitch","tabu","father","paresh","rawal","coupl","decid","meet","father","approv","marriag","amitabh","realiz","tabu","father","young","complic","begin","perform","wise","three","actor","brilliant","script","veri","tight","interest","dialogu","catchi","somewher","feel","stomach","properli","fill","comedi","sometim","properli","understand","conjur","try","go","lengthi","partsbr","music","noth","sing","except","titl","track","camerawork","good","director","r","balki","give","well","script","half","look","confus","satyagrah","scene","father","look","irrit","line","speak","amitabh","bachchan","dure","scene","clap","worthybr","whole","cheeni","kum","ne","sugar"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,6,8,15,16,17,19,20,27,30,33,36,39,41,43,49,54,58,60,64,71,77,90,105,107,110,111,118,127,135,147,156,169,206,212,224,232,239,248,249,253,264,266,289,343,344,350,382,405,427,449,500,553,660,694,721,782,804,867,912,958,1025,1092,1170,1379,1478,1602,1618,1635,1825,2079,2101,2265,2293,2363,2386,2592,2937,3087,3449,3787,3896,3937,4185,4252,5122,5870,6295,6422,7567,8364],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

{"value":"Okay I had heard little about this film, so when it came on the movie channels on TV, I wanted to watch it, being a horror aficionado. I think I can do a collective \"huh?\" for everyone who watched it.<br /><br />I decided to move on with my life, but at a party with my closest friends, we saw it was coming on and some of us having seen it already decided we could laugh our way through it, both of us proclaiming \"this is the dumbest thing I've ever seen\". It wasn't scary; Ill give it to Roth (who I think is a young hack); characters do change throughout the film, ala \"Cube\".<br /><br />HOWEVER despite your typical \"rats in a cage\" scenario- who will turn on who, etc., it was pretty average horror.<br /><br />A few points: 1.) What was with that kid? I'm not even talking about him being weird and biting people. I'm talking about the whole \"slow motion karate kicking\", what was that? 2.) Okay I know Rider's character liked Jordan Ladd's, but as a young woman, I was appalled that he just went ahead and molested her in her sleep. Uh, thats illegal.<br /><br />3.) Roth was in the movie just so Roth could be in the movie. Talk about pointlessly writing yourself in! 4.) What was with the deputy? 5.) So she was just instantly pulled apart by the dog? And there was little to no blood left? Just a scrap of her jeans? Anyway we were LAUGHING our asses off, and I love laughing during horror movies (Return of the Living Dead 2, Evil Dead), but I don't know if we were supposed to be laughing

{"value":"A retired diplomat, played nicely by Michael York, goes to Russia to get revenge on the Russian gangster that murdered the diplomat's policeman son. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice.<br /><br />I remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the Russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous U.S. government. It's interesting to see this time the Russian guy as a hero.<br /><br />Not a great flick, it's really typically a \"B\" action flick. Michael York lends some class to this mediocre movie. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop is kind of \"blah\" but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is such a good actor that he'd have chemistry with anyone he's doing a scene with. Disappointingly, the handsome Adrian Paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie. Now, if Adrian Paul was in this movie longer, it would've been an above average \"B\" action flick. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical bad guy. He's very blonde and very villainous in this movie.<br /><br />Rent this flick if there is nothing else on TV to watch. It's okay. It doesn't suck too bad. The action scenes are decent. The acting could be better, the plot could've moved much faster, but hey, you get to see what Russia looks like

{"value":"This movie was pretty bad. Sci-fi is usually my favorite channel so I watch all the original movies that play on it. I really don't know if this movie can be called original. Starting a zoo/theme park on a remote island sounds pretty familiar. What was it, oh yeah, Jurassic Park. But this has Sabertooth tigers instead.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a few stereotypical college kids on an island doing some kind of treasure hunt. One of them ends up dieing a rather gruesome death with some of the worst special effects I've seen. The blood looked a lot like ketchup. Also at the beginning there is a scientist who wants to make as many saber tooth tigers as possible for people to enjoy. 3 of them have already escaped and are going around eating the tourists, or the people invited to the island to see the tigers first hand. Again, sound like Jurassic Park. Probably the coolest thing was the 1000lb saber tooth who crawled around on his front legs killing the mad scientist with a tooth statue of sorts that somehow shrinks and goes through the guys neck. Funniest death I've seen on TV.<br /><br />The acting is extremely cheesy, the special effects are horrible. The CG tigers could almost pass for clay models, and even some of the sounds were off. For instance, when one of the college students is trying to escape, he uses an ax to break down a door, the ax goes into the door and about 2 seconds later you hear the sound. This movie was pretty bad.

{"value":"WOW! Pretty terrible stuff. The Richard Burton/Elizabeth Taylor roadshow lands in Sardinia and hooks up with arty director Joseph Losey for this remarkably ill-conceived Tennessee Williams fiasco. Taylor plays a rich, dying widow holding fort over her minions on an island where she dictates, very loudly, her memoirs to an incredibly patient secretary. When scoundrel Burton shows up claiming to be a poet and old friend, Taylor realizes her time is up. Ludicrious in the extreme --- it's difficult to determine if Taylor and Burton are acting badly OR if it was Williams' intention to make their characters so unappealing. If that's the case, then the acting is brilliant! Burton mumbles his lines, including the word BOOM several times, while Taylor screeches her's. She's really awful. So is Noel Coward as Taylor's catty confidante, the \"Witch of Capri.\" <br /><br />Presumably BOOM is about how fleeting time is and how fast life moves along --- two standard Williams themes, but it's so misdirected by Losey, that had Taylor and Burton not spelled it out for the audience during their mostly inane monologues, any substance the film has would have been completely diluted. <br /><br />BOOM does have stunning photography---the camera would have to have been out of focus to screw up the beauty of Sardinia! The supporting cast features Joanna Shimkus, the great Romolo Valli as Taylor's resourceful doctor and Michael Dunn as her nasty dwarf security guard...both he and his dogs do a number on

{"value":"Townies is the laziest movie I have ever seen, and I saw the Blair Witch movies (parts one and two). It seems confused in what it wants to be. It's not funny enough for comedy, it's not tragic enough for drama, it's not bloody enough for horror, and it's not good enough for watching. It has scenes of a man doing \"slapstick/bloody\" karate so I think, oh this movie will be in the vein of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash. Then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl, a retarded (mentally handicap) woman and a trusting mother. Then it slaps itself into the ONLY good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks. The part I'm speaking of is a lonely TOWNIE who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse. That was the ONLY part of the movie that gave me ANY feeling. The rest was a waist of my life. Then, just to show how CRUEL Wayne is there is a kind of DOCUMENTARY at the end of the film of Wayne (the Director) making fun of Toby (the star) in public. It made me sick. Even though Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd (two other movies by Wayne) aren't the best, they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits.

{"value":"Three Stooges - Have Rocket, Will Travel - 1959 This was the first feature length film to star the Stooges and it is pretty bad. It makes THE THREE STOOGES GO AROUND THE WORLD IN A DAZE (from 1963) look like a masterpiece.<br /><br />The Stooges are janitors at a rocket place. They climb into a rocket and it goes to Venus. They meet some stuff there including a talking unicorn they call \"Uni\" which they bring back to Earth with them. \"Uni\" speaks like an average, pleasant person - 'Oh, hello. How are you? Lovely planet here. Hope you like it.' Hilarious.<br /><br />Very few gags and so many of the scenes just go on and on and on.<br /><br />The Stooges arrive back from space and the film is over as far as the story goes, but no one told that to the film makers for the picture continues for another 10 minutes or so at a party where nothing much happens. The Stooges leave the party and then the film is almost over.<br /><br />High point of the film - the end where the Stooges sing a dapper little song about their journey. The Larry and Curly Joe hit Moe in the face with two pies. Brutal.<br /><br />Another writer mentioned the fine musical score. Huh? The only music I even noticed were two classic tunes - I'LL TAKE ROMANCE and THERE GOES THAT SONG AGAIN, both of which are played at the party. And *that* really is the high point of the picture - music from old Columbia films.<br /><br />The tall sexy blonde was nice.<br /><br />Awful - a brand new VHS video from the 99 Cents Only

{"value":"Without reiterating what was said above about this movie, I would like to add that I was looking forward to watching this film...the cast/location and the work of the excellent director Michael Winterbottom etc...It had a vague shadow of 'Don't look Now' about the storyline from the beginning. A stay in different surroundings (Italy again) to dim the heartbreak of loss...or perhaps that's how I saw it? So consequently I sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign European country....and I sat there and sat there....and guess what? nothing actually happens! and I mean nothing!! You are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuous..You are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it's head...The eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys, had great scope to take the movie in another direction, the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise, the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age. It felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect. When the credits started to roll (unexpectedly) you can't help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish.","finished_norm":["without","reiter","what","be","sai","abov","about","thi","movi","i","would","like","to","add","that","i","be","look","forward","to","watch","thi","filmth","castloc","and","the","work","of","the","excel","director","michael","winterbottom","etcit","have","a","vagu","shadow","of","do","not","look","now","about","the","storylin","from","the","begin","a","stai","in","differ","surround","itali","again","to","dim","the","heartbreak","of","lossor","perhap","that","how","i","see","it","so","consequ","i","sit","there","wait","for","the","stori","to","unfold","and","put","a","spin","on","what","we","expect","to","happen","to","thi","famili","in","a","foreign","european","countryand","i","sit","there","and","sit","thereand","guess","what","noth","actual","happen","and","i","mean","noth","you","be","not","even","give","the","chanc","to","get","into","the","charact","a","thei","be","so","dimension","and","vacuousy","be","lead","to","believ","from","the","pace","of","the","movi","that","someth","be","go","to","happen","to","turn","the","whole","film","on","it","headth","eldest","daughter","flirtat","with","the","local","vespa","boi","have","great","scope","to","take","the","movi","in","anoth","direct","the","young","daughter","vision","of","her","dead","mother","end","up","be","a","fruitless","and","pointless","exercis","the","father","attempt","at","be","seduc","by","on","of","hi","femal","student","feel","ridicul","give","hi","ag","it","feel","a","if","the","script","have","a","last","recal","make","where","thei","decid","at","the","last","minut","to","erad","ani","gut","to","the","stori","and","go","for","pare","it","down","to","a","bare","minimum","to","no","effect","when","the","credit","start","to","roll","unexpectedli","you","ca","not","help","but","feel","rob","of","your","time","spend","sit","watch","thi","pile","of","rubbish"],"filtered":["without","reiter","sai","abov","thi","movi","like","add","look","forward","watch","thi","filmth","castloc","work","excel","director","michael","winterbottom","etcit","vagu","shadow","look","storylin","begin","stai","differ","surround","itali","dim","heartbreak","lossor","perhap","see","consequ","sit","wait","stori","unfold","put","spin","expect","happen","thi","famili","foreign","european","countryand","sit","sit","thereand","guess","noth","actual","happen","mean","noth","even","give","chanc","get","charact","thei","dimension","vacuousy","lead","believ","pace","movi","someth","go","happen","turn","whole","film","headth","eldest","daughter","flirtat","local","vespa","boi","great","scope","take","movi","anoth","direct","young","daughter","vision","dead","mother","end","fruitless","pointless","exercis","father","attempt","seduc","hi","femal","student","feel","ridicul","give","hi","ag","feel","script","last","recal","make","thei","decid","last","minut","erad","ani","gut","stori","go","pare","bare","minimum","effect","credit","start","roll","unexpectedli","ca","help","feel","rob","time","spend","sit","watch","thi","pile","rubbish"],"filtered2":["without","reiter","abov","like","add","look","forward","watch","filmth","castloc","work","excel","director","michael","winterbottom","etcit","vagu","shadow","look","storylin","begin","stai","differ","surround","itali","dim","heartbreak","lossor","perhap","see","consequ","sit","wait","stori","unfold","put","spin","expect","happen","famili","foreign","european","countryand","sit","sit","thereand","guess","noth","actual","happen","mean","noth","even","give","chanc","get","charact","dimension","vacuousy","lead","believ","pace","someth","go","happen","turn","whole","headth","eldest","daughter","flirtat","local","vespa","boi","great","scope","take","anoth","direct","young","daughter","vision","dead","mother","end","fruitless","pointless","exercis","father","attempt","seduc","femal","student","feel","ridicul","give","ag","feel","script","last","recal","make","decid","last","minut","erad","ani","gut","stori","go","pare","bare","minimum","effect","credit","start","roll","unexpectedli","ca","help","feel","rob","time","spend","sit","watch","pile","rubbish"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,7,8,10,16,17,24,27,30,31,43,48,49,51,52,53,58,59,71,73,77,81,88,91,94,96,102,106,111,125,130,135,144,147,157,159,177,182,185,204,228,243,244,249,274,282,283,299,318,331,343,356,366,397,422,426,442,466,475,486,515,531,546,580,594,626,699,704,795,1098,1133,1275,1406,1508,1510,1553,1703,1768,1770,1808,1846,2082,2306,2603,2661,2709,3171,3819,3922,5109,5227,6514,8516],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5

{"value":"Wow, I knew this film was going to be bad but not this bad. Spoilerific comments ensue.<br /><br />Roddy Roddy Piper is sickly sweet retired cop (cliche!), helping out everyone - smiling like a post-op lobotomy patient through-out and lamenting over his dead son. His adopted son returns from Armed Forces \"Special Ops\" and because he's \"seen things\" - portrayed by clenching his teeth if anyone mentions anything about the past. Time to clean up the streets from another guy who once knew Piper and his dead son (who the bad lad killed) and his adopted son.<br /><br />Oh, the love interest is a pretty young lady who decides for no reason that she wants to jump the bones of the ex-Army bloke. This happens in about 2 minutes of 1 scene.<br /><br />The action could have saved this film, but it's even worse than the storyline and acting. It's all been done before, it's all been done much much better (Ong-Bak is a prime example). This is the worst film I've ever seen - and I've seen Waterworld, twice.<br /><br />Erm, the film is called HONOR (Spelt Wrong for the Americans) and the tag line has \"from the makers of Bloodsport and Kickboxer\" - check out Director David Worths other films and you'll soon realise why they put these 2 films on there, even though they are over 10 years old.

{"value":"What's written on the poster is: \"At birth he was given 6 years to live... At 34 he takes the journey of a lifetime.\" Ami is an American-born Israeli who was diagnosed with Muscular Dystrophy disease at the age of one. At age of 34, after the love toward his 22 years old care-giver didn't go well, he decided to come to the US to face the doctor who said that he would have only 6 years to live. He wanted to show the doctor that he is still alive, and weights 39 pounds. Why? Your guess is as good as mine, even I have seen this film.<br /><br />Obviously it's courageous to live when all he can move is his left index finger, but why does he have so much anger toward the doctor who diagnosed his disease 34 years ago? His doctor just told his mom that based on the medical history, people with his disease won't live long. What's the point of him showing up at old doctor's door for? Why is tracking down this old doctor in the US is a journey of his lifetime? There are so many things we might be interested in Ami's life: how can he make those animations with the movement of only one finger? How can he go through daily lives while totally depending on others? How did he out lived his doctor's prediction? How does he deal emotionally when other people look at him like looking at a strange creature? The movie told us none of that. Instead, the filmmaker got a van and set up a trip to let Ami to show up at his old doctor's door in order to show him that he is still alive.

{"value":"Another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story. Within 15 minutes, the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines, so there is absolutely no mystery, which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense. The only half-way competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film, so we're left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things. Low budget films can't afford expensive special effects, so the CGI portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive, but were at least a valid attempt. The creature suit is terrible, as seen when it falls to the sidewalk, and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes, which aren't even the red color shown in mirror shots. The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired, with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator. The last action sequence takes place in a police station, also a rip-off from Terminator, with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the Darkwolf doesn't smash into. In the end, the girl calls the hero \"a good Protector\", but he gets both his partners, the original Protector, and at least three other civilians, not to mention a dozen cops, all killed without getting a decent shot off, in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun. But here's the real clincher for bad writing: They could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes.

{"value":"He pulled the guys guts out his butt! That's a spoof right?! No one really writes that it just happens like improv gone horribly wrong. I think any way. This movie must be a spoof because who would say they wrote that script otherwise. Can anyone imagine the entire cast sitting around as the director and writers go over the storyboard.<br /><br />Director says, \"next our inbreed villain uses his 24 inch machete to disembowel our token creepy neighbor. Get this, he is going to pull the guts out his bunghole\"<br /><br />\"Brilliant!\" the entire cast proclaims.<br /><br />No way can that happen, nobody writes that stupid! Gotta be a spoof.<br /><br />I loved the part where the skinny introspective gal beats the inbreed freak to death with the cast iron skillet she finds on the floor of the cave. I wasn't sure the inbreed cannibal types bothered to cook much. Maybe that explains why the skillet was lying on the floor in the dark at just the right time to kill the malformed hulk. Seems ironic that after the freaky guy had bested martial arts expert porn queens and a couple out doors type jocks he falls so easily to the frying pan of a skinny defenseless girl next door. <br /><br />What the heck is that Richard Greco guy doing in this? Did he fire his agent or something? <br /><br />Can anyone explain the ending to me please because I didn't get it either? I can't quite figure why the nice hero girl wanted to kill the funny lady who was making her some tea.

{"value":"Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of Dr. Seuss' classic tale, and well... it's not very good. First off, following a classic act like Chuck Jones' animated TV special is going to be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy-handed and padded as to be positively numbing. I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab, at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically over the top here, but that is completely at odds with the character of the Grinch. As characterised by Boris Karloff, he was a slow burn; methodical and sly. There is no method to Carrey's madness, and that is only the most obvious error made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are utterly wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I mean , I understand that Tony Hopkins will take just about any role offered (much like his countryman Michael Caine), but this one needs to be filed under \"Films that should never have been made.\" This does not bode well for the Cat in the Hat, an even thinner tome that Universal is prepping for this Christmas. I get the feeling that I will be making the same recommendation for that one as I am with this one: skip it, and either read the book or watch the TV special.

{"value":"'The Vampire Bat' is definitely of interest, being one of the early genre-setting horror films of the 1930's, but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise.<br /><br />The film is set in a European village sometime in the 19th Century, where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals. There is a very similar feel to James Whale's 'Frankenstein' and this is compounded by the introduction of Lionel Atwill's Dr Niemann character, complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement.<br /><br />The vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red-herring by having suspicion fall on bat-loving village simpleton Herman (Dwight Frye), thus providing the excuse for a torch-wielding mob to go on the rampage - as if they needed one.<br /><br />This is one of a trio of early horror films in which Lional Atwill and Fay Wray co-starred (also 'Doctor X' and 'The Mystery of the Wax Museum') and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill-advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements. Taken in context though, 'The Vampire Bat' is still weak and derivative.<br /><br />All we are left with is a poor-quality Frankenstein imitation, with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink Dracula fans. But for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director Frank Strayer was doing the 'Blondie' films a few years later.","finished_norm":["the","vampir","bat","be","definit","of","interest","be","on","of","the","earli","genreset","horror","film","of","the","but","take","in","isol","everyth","be","a","bite","too","creaki","for","ani","genuin","praisebr","br","the","film","be","set","in","a","european","villag","sometim","in","the","th","centuri","where","a","seri","of","murder","be","be","attribut","to","vampir","by","the","suspici","local","there","be","a","veri","similar","feel","to","jame","whale","frankenstein","and","thi","be","compound","by","the","introduct","of","lionel","atwil","dr","niemann","charact","complet","with","hi","misguid","idea","for","scientif","advancementbr","br","the","vampir","theme","be","arbitrari","and","onli","us","a","a","redher","by","have","suspicion","fall","on","batlov","villag","simpleton","herman","dwight","frye","thu","provid","the","excus","for","a","torchwield","mob","to","go","on","the","rampag","a","if","thei","ne","onebr","br","thi","be","on","of","a","trio","of","earli","horror","film","in","which","lional","atwil","and","fai","wrai","costar","conjur","doctor","x","and","the","mysteri","of","the","wax","museum","and","like","their","other","collabor","the","film","suffer","from","illadvis","comic","relief","and","a","tendenc","to","strai","from","horror","to","mainstream","thriller","elem","take","in","context","though","the","vampir","bat","be","still","weak","and","derivativebr","br","all","we","be","leav","with","be","a","poorqual","frankenstein","imit","with","the","vampir","elem","pure","a","devic","to","hoodwink","dracula","fan","but","for","the","titl","the","film","would","struggl","to","even","be","consid","a","a","horror","and","it","be","worth","note","that","director","frank","strayer","be","do","the","blondi","film","a","few","year","late"],"filtered":["vampir","bat","definit","interest","earli","genreset","horror","film","take","isol","everyth","bite","creaki","ani","genuin","praisebr","br","film","set","european","villag","sometim","th","centuri","seri","murder","attribut","vampir","suspici","local","veri","similar","feel","jame","whale","frankenstein","thi","compound","introduct","lionel","atwil","dr","niemann","charact","complet","hi","misguid","idea","scientif","advancementbr","br","vampir","theme","arbitrari","onli","us","redher","suspicion","fall","batlov","villag","simpleton","herman","dwight","frye","thu","provid","excus","torchwield","mob","go","rampag","thei","ne","onebr","br","thi","trio","earli","horror","film","lional","atwil","fai","wrai","costar","conjur","doctor","x","mysteri","wax","museum","like","collabor","film","suffer","illadvis","comic","relief","tendenc","strai","horror","mainstream","thriller","elem","take","context","though","vampir","bat","still","weak","derivativebr","br","leav","poorqual","frankenstein","imit","vampir","elem","pure","devic","hoodwink","dracula","fan","titl","film","struggl","even","consid","horror","worth","note","director","frank","strayer","blondi","film","year","late"],"filtered2":["vampir","bat","definit","interest","earli","genreset","horror","take","isol","everyth","bite","creaki","ani","genuin","praisebr","set","european","villag","sometim","th","centuri","murder","attribut","vampir","suspici","local","veri","similar","feel","jame","whale","frankenstein","compound","introduct","lionel","atwil","dr","niemann","charact","complet","misguid","idea","scientif","advancementbr","vampir","theme","arbitrari","onli","us","redher","suspicion","fall","batlov","villag","simpleton","herman","dwight","frye","thu","provid","excus","torchwield","mob","go","rampag","ne","onebr","trio","earli","horror","lional","atwil","fai","wrai","costar","conjur","doctor","x","mysteri","wax","museum","like","collabor","suffer","illadvis","comic","relief","tendenc","strai","horror","mainstream","thriller","elem","take","context","though","vampir","bat","still","weak","derivativebr","leav","poorqual","frankenstein","imit","vampir","elem","pure","devic","hoodwink","dracula","fan","titl","struggl","even","consid","horror","worth","note","director","frank","strayer","blondi","year","late"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,6,10,11,15,27,31,39,43,56,57,58,60,64,74,83,86,103,109,110,123,140,150,154,169,193,219,264,266,273,317,379,392,403,475,479,480,485,500,534,560,589,617,620,633,692,695,714,726,739,842,853,1163,1166,1192,1406,1435,1470,1474,1555,1585,1684,1688,1754,1994,2001,2145,2288,2462,2531,2589,2798,2799,2963,3175,3230,3330,3480,3817,4041,4105,4284,4388,4482,4580,4629,5066,5275,5910,6666],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,6,10,11,15,27,31,39,4

{"value":"What a poor excuse for New Zealnd Movie making. I'm ashamed to call myself a New Zealander when this movie exists and is currently playing on New Zealand satellite TV (Aug 2006). The cast is made up of a large number of local soap stars. The ship, in real life, is one of the inter-island ferries that travel daily between the two main islands and even has the company's logo (a dolphin) still all over the set including on the ship's funnel. The ship is supposed to be a cruise ship/ferry between the USA and Mexico. It has obvious signs of rust and old age all over the place yet is supposed to be a luxury ship on it's maiden voyage. One of the scenes shows the snow capped peaks of New Zealand's South island in the background for God's sake! Must have been a very cold time on the USA/Mexico area! The story is weak, the acting is weaker and the new Zealand/American accents just don't work. I expect the New Zealand tax payer contributed to the production cost of this movie and that was a waste of money better spent on a real production. I know high school kids in New Zealand who could make better movies with their cell phones. Goof: There is a truck in the hold with tagging on it and they stuck a Taco Company sign on the door of the truck, presumably to make it look like it was American. But some of the sign is over the top of the tagging - you'd think they would have noticed that in the props department before attaching it. I'd love to go on but it just isn't worth the trouble in any

{"value":"In 17th Century Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. Whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives. Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved Japan. Shogun Mayeda is a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents.<br /><br />Starring cinema legends Sho Kosugi (Tenchu: Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings Trilogy), John Rhys Davies (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a film masterpiece.<br /><br />The Osaka winning stunt team bought to the screen by Bob Ivy bring exciting battle/action sequences such as the opening battle against the Eastern army, the attack on Mayeda's ship carrying priceless jewels and the final confrontation between Sho Kosugi and David Essex. A fine musical score by famed composer John Scott is also present. Director Sho Kusugi was not even nominated for an Oscar for this film which deals with the emotional strife such as the death of Mayedas family, the search for love and acceptance after grieving, all of which is dealt with extremely well. Highly recommended cinematic masterpiece.<br /><br />Please note: All of the above is opposite for the film in question.","finished_norm":["in","th","centuri","japan","there","live","a","samurai","who","would","set","the","standard","for","the","ag","hi","name","be","mayeda","he","be","send","on","a","epic","journei","across","the","world","to","acquir","muscat","from","the","king","of","spain","whilst","at","sea","a","violent","storm","swallow","their","preciou","gold","intend","to","bui","the","weapon","and","almost","take","their","live","mayeda","must","battl","all","odd","to","surviv","and","the","secur","the","fate","of","hi","belov","japan","shogun","mayeda","be","a","multi","million","dollar","action","adventur","epic","set","across","three","continentsbr","br","star","cinema","legend","sho","kosugi","tenchu","stealth","assassin","christoph","lee","star","war","lord","of","the","ring","trilogi","john","rhy","davi","lord","of","the","ring","trilogi","indiana","jone","trilogi","and","toshiro","milfun","the","seven","samurai","throne","of","blood","shogun","mayeda","kabuto","be","a","film","masterpiecebr","br","the","osaka","win","stunt","team","bui","to","the","screen","by","bob","ivi","bring","excit","battleact","sequenc","such","a","the","open","battl","against","the","eastern","armi","the","attack","on","mayeda","ship","carri","priceless","jewel","and","the","final","confront","between","sho","kosugi","and","david","essex","a","fine","music","score","by","fame","compos","john","scott","be","conjur","present","director","sho","kusugi","be","not","even","nomin","for","a","oscar","for","thi","film","which","deal","with","the","emot","strife","such","a","the","death","of","mayeda","famili","the","search","for","love","and","accept","after","griev","all","of","which","be","deal","with","extrem","good","highli","recommend","cinemat","masterpiecebr","br","pleas","note","all","of","the","abov","be","opposit","for","the","film","in","question"],"filtered":["th","centuri","japan","live","samurai","set","standard","ag","hi","name","mayeda","send","epic","journei","across","world","acquir","muscat","king","spain","whilst","sea","violent","storm","swallow","preciou","gold","intend","bui","weapon","almost","take","live","mayeda","must","battl","odd","surviv","secur","fate","hi","belov","japan","shogun","mayeda","multi","million","dollar","action","adventur","epic","set","across","three","continentsbr","br","star","cinema","legend","sho","kosugi","tenchu","stealth","assassin","christoph","lee","star","war","lord","ring","trilogi","john","rhy","davi","lord","ring","trilogi","indiana","jone","trilogi","toshiro","milfun","seven","samurai","throne","blood","shogun","mayeda","kabuto","film","masterpiecebr","br","osaka","win","stunt","team","bui","screen","bob","ivi","bring","excit","battleact","sequenc","open","battl","eastern","armi","attack","mayeda","ship","carri","priceless","jewel","final","confront","sho","kosugi","david","essex","fine","music","score","fame","compos","john","scott","conjur","present","director","sho","kusugi","even","nomin","oscar","thi","film","deal","emot","strife","death","mayeda","famili","search","love","accept","griev","deal","extrem","good","highli","recommend","cinemat","masterpiecebr","br","pleas","note","abov","opposit","film","question"],"filtered2":["th","centuri","japan","live","samurai","set","standard","ag","name","mayeda","send","epic","journei","across","world","acquir","muscat","king","spain","whilst","sea","violent","storm","swallow","preciou","gold","intend","bui","weapon","almost","take","live","mayeda","must","battl","odd","surviv","secur","fate","belov","japan","shogun","mayeda","multi","million","dollar","action","adventur","epic","set","across","three","continentsbr","star","cinema","legend","sho","kosugi","tenchu","stealth","assassin","christoph","lee","star","war","lord","ring","trilogi","john","rhy","davi","lord","ring","trilogi","indiana","jone","trilogi","toshiro","milfun","seven","samurai","throne","blood","shogun","mayeda","kabuto","masterpiecebr","osaka","win","stunt","team","bui","screen","bob","ivi","bring","excit","battleact","sequenc","open","battl","eastern","armi","attack","mayeda","ship","carri","priceless","jewel","final","confront","sho","kosugi","david","essex","fine","music","score","fame","compos","john","scott","conjur","present","director","sho","kusugi","even","nomin","oscar","deal","emot","strife","death","mayeda","famili","search","love","accept","griev","deal","extrem","good","highli","recommend","cinemat","masterpiecebr","pleas","note","abov","opposit","question"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,5,31,39,54,58,100,109,116,118,129,131,141,143,156,165,182,192,224,242,245,250,291,298,314,329,346,347,349,354,378,409,411,442,464,468,489,495,503,506,518,524,541,560,570,616,621,675,704,721,723,741,772,786,807,853,886,896,926,930,966,979,982,987,1038,1076,1084,1089,1093,1162,1163,1195,1279,1310,1377,1446,1509,1532,1544,1567,1598,1652,1687,1697,1771,1800,1807,1809,1834,1841,1944,1954,1972,2402,2489,2530,2575,2935,2953,3280,4170,4349,4828,5114,5421,

{"value":"I quote Oedpius Rex because it is a tragedy that this film was even made!!!<br /><br />This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen! I am in no way an Uwe Boll hater like most of the humourless people on IMDb! <br /><br />Uwe Boll movies like Postal and Tunnel Rats are hilariously bad and therefore entertaining. But honestly, this movie was just horrible. I hated it so much that I'd give it a zero star rating if I could. The story is just crap! It spends four fifths of the film building the plot and then they have the middle which is just scenes of grizzly horrible tastelessly done murder! The finally end it with a \"villan wins ending\" which is totally acceptable but surely it could have been more tasteful than this! <br /><br />I am not against Uwe Boll (like I said earlier) nor am I against violent movies! I f**king love violent movies! I loved the Saw movies, the Hostel movies, Tokyo Gore Police, The New York Ripper, the 28 movies, Dog Soldiers, My Bloody Valentine, Last House on the Left, Watchmen, Wolf Creek, every Tarantino movie, every Sam Peckinpah, even Cannibal f**king Holocaust! But this! OMFG!!! <br /><br />This was just cruel, sadistic and perverted! And look at the movies I just listed! If I liked Cannibal Holocaust and not this then it must be bad!

{"value":"I just got back from this free screening, and this \"Osama Witch Project\" is the hands-down worst film I've seen this year, worse than even \"Catwoman\" - which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction.<br /><br />In \"September Tapes,\" a \"film crew\" of \"documentary journalists\" heads to Afghanistan - despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip, the conditions and, oh yeah, the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife's death on Sept. 11 - to track down Osama bin Laden.<br /><br />They \"made\" eight tapes on their journey, which now \"document\" their travels and, of course, their attempts to kill the terrorist leader. (The eight tapes, thankfully, all end at points significant in the narrative, which is convenient for a \"documentary.\")<br /><br />The psychotic, idiotic protagonist - who is given to long, significant speeches that he probably learned watching \"MacGyver\" - cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps. I don't know why he didn't just wear a sign on his back that said \"Shoot me.\"<br /><br />The crew's translator, supposedly their sensible voice-of-reason, does little more than whine and gets

{"value":"Average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a film should probably give this one a pass. It generates the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual images that seem to have some relationship one to another, but never coalesce into a totality.<br /><br />While this isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage may appeal to a few students or critics steeped in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking, it is flatly irritating and condescending to us commoners who just fell off the haywagon. An overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but to me it comes across as Andy Warhol warmed over. The only redeeming characteristic I find is in the production values, and them there just ain't going to cut it all by themselfs.<br /><br />This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes. Sorry. The calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir. I get the same big yawn and let-down reading what I guess are very knowledgeable and thorough comments about this film that never lead to anything truly comprehensible.

{"value":"The film is bad. There is no other way to say it. The story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. I don't think most people know what a \"walker\" is or will really care. I felt as if I was watching a movie from the 70's. The subject was just not believable for the year 2007, even being set in DC. I think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end. Most didn't stay for the Q&A either.<br /><br />I don't think Schrader really thought the film out ahead of time. Many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn't know how to finish them. He jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on. I really didn't get Woody's (Carter) private life or boyfriend either. What were all the \"artistic\" male bondage and torture pictures (from Iraq prisons) about? What was he thinking? I think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for Woody's character (Car). It didn't work. It didn't even seem to make sense really.<br /><br />The only good thing about this film was Woody Harrelson. He played his character (Car) flawlessly. You really did get a great sense of what a \"walker\" may have been like (say twenty years ago).

{"value":"Now, I've seen a lot of bad movies. I like bad movies. Especially bad action movies. I've seen (and enjoyed) all of Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies, including the one where he's his own clone, both of the ones where he plays twins, and all three where he's a cyborg. I actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians. (Hey, if nothing else, he's got a great ass and you almost always get to see it. With DVD, you can even pause and zoom in!) That's why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad, it makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane.<br /><br />Everything about Snake Eater is bad. The plot is bad. The script is bad. The sets are bad. The fights are bad. The stunts are bad. The FX are bad. The acting is spectacularly, earth-time-bendingly bad, very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so-called actor in the cast, including Lorenzo Lamas, and that's really saying something. And I'd be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed, to boot. ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas. <br /><br />It does manage to be unintentionally funny, so it's not a total loss. However, I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very, very stoned. I was able to sit through it myself because I needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry.<br /><br />It didn't help much, but it was better than nothing.

{"value":"I will never forget the wit and great comedy of the ORIGINAL Vacation movie! The lines, pacing, and timing of events in that film are outstanding! However, this European Vacation sequel is a major let down.<br /><br />In this sequel, the Griswalds win a European Vacation on a game show. The problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild, \"ha-ha\" laughs. For example, a Flight Attendant on an airplane asks Clark, \"Do you want your Coke in the Can?\" Clark answers back, \"No, I'll have it right here.\" That's really about the only line that is funny in this film.<br /><br />European Vacation's humor is strained. As if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie, tried to re-hash a script that had been done before, and relied on a ridiculous slap-stick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time.<br /><br />Worse, the natural comic standouts like Randy Quaid as Cousin Eddie and the original kids who played Rusty and Audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found. Their replacements are not funny, can't act, and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time. There are also a few crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny, they are in bad taste.<br /><br />The Griswald's should have stayed in Wally World. The place that made them legends! Don't join them on this European dreadful adventure. Viewers should re-watch the original Vacation movie in place of this!

{"value":"`In the tradition of 'Carrie' and 'Heathers'? Try `a shameless ripoff of not only those two films, but 'The Evil Dead' and 'The Shining' as well.' That said, they really don't make bad horror movies like this anymore, and that's a shame, 'cause it's a gas.<br /><br />Rainbow Harvest is the Winona substitute here, and although she barely does more than mumble her lines (and occasionally scream, `YOU'RE UGLY!!!' into her haunted mirror), she's Goth way before it's fashionable, so you have to respect her. (And she's quite creative about it too, accessorizing with black leather scarves and a kind of black-spray-painted Hawaiian-Punch-guy hat. Eat your heart out, Cher.)<br /><br />Karen Black overacts a bit, but she's not totally without dignity, and you can't help but sympathize with her. (Unless you're a certain friend of mine, who asked, `Who is that, Horse Lips from 'M.A.S.H'?' the first time she came onscreen.)<br /><br />There are decent supporting performances by Kristin Dattilo (as the square chick who befriends Rainbow), Ricky Paull Goldin (in his trademarked wisecracking hunk role), and William `Larry, Darryl and Darryl' Sanderson (as some kind of pet undertaker, or something). But it's sad to see the once smokin' Yvonne DeCarlo reduced to playing what can only be thought of as the Charlotte Rae part.<br /><br />The eighties were the heyday for hilarious, mindbogglingly dumb horror movies like this, and `Mirror, Mirror' was one of the last of its kind. Definitely worth a look.","finished_norm":["in","the","tradit","of","carri","and","heather","try","a","shameless","ripoff","of","not","onli","that","two","film","but","the","evil","dead","and","the","shine","a","good","that","sai","thei","realli","do","not","make","bad","horror","movi","like","thi","anymor","and","that","a","shame","caus","it","a","gasbr","br","rainbow","harvest","be","the","winona","substitut","here","and","although","she","bare","doe","much","than","mumbl","her","line","and","occasion","scream","you","re","ugli","into","her","haunt","mirror","she","goth","wai","befor","it","fashion","so","you","have","to","respect","her","and","she","quit","creativ","about","it","too","accessor","with","black","leather","scarf","and","a","kind","of","blackspraypaint","hawaiianpunchgui","hat","eat","your","heart","out","cherbr","br","karen","black","overact","a","bite","but","she","not","total","without","digniti","and","you","ca","not","help","but","sympath","with","her","unless","you","re","a","certain","friend","of","mine","who","ask","who","be","that","hors","lip","from","mash","the","time","she","come","onscreenbr","br","there","be","decent","support","perform","by","kristin","dattilo","a","the","squar","chick","who","befriend","rainbow","ricki","paull","goldin","in","hi","trademark","wisecrack","hunk","role","and","william","larri","darryl","and","darryl","sanderson","a","some","kind","of","pet","undertak","or","someth","but","it","sad","to","see","the","onc","smokin","yvonn","decarlo","reduc","to","plai","what","can","onli","be","think","of","a","the","charlott","rae","partbr","br","the","eighti","be","the","heydai","for","hilari","mindbogglingli","dumb","horror","movi","like","thi","and","mirror","mirror","be","on","of","the","last","of","it","kind","definit","worth","a","look"],"filtered":["tradit","carri","heather","try","shameless","ripoff","onli","two","film","evil","dead","shine","good","sai","thei","realli","make","bad","horror","movi","like","thi","anymor","shame","caus","gasbr","br","rainbow","harvest","winona","substitut","although","bare","doe","much","mumbl","line","occasion","scream","re","ugli","haunt","mirror","goth","wai","befor","fashion","respect","quit","creativ","accessor","black","leather","scarf","kind","blackspraypaint","hawaiianpunchgui","hat","eat","heart","cherbr","br","karen","black","overact","bite","total","without","digniti","ca","help","sympath","unless","re","certain","friend","mine","ask","hors","lip","mash","time","come","onscreenbr","br","decent","support","perform","kristin","dattilo","squar","chick","befriend","rainbow","ricki","paull","goldin","hi","trademark","wisecrack","hunk","role","william","larri","darryl","darryl","sanderson","kind","pet","undertak","someth","sad","see","onc","smokin","yvonn","decarlo","reduc","plai","onli","think","charlott","rae","partbr","br","eighti","heydai","hilari","mindbogglingli","dumb","horror","movi","like","thi","mirror","mirror","last","kind","definit","worth","look"],"filtered2":["tradit","carri","heather","try","shameless","ripoff","onli","two","evil","dead","shine","good","realli","make","bad","horror","like","anymor","shame","caus","gasbr","rainbow","harvest","winona","substitut","although","bare","doe","mumbl","line","occasion","scream","re","ugli","haunt","mirror","goth","wai","befor","fashion","respect","quit","creativ","accessor","black","leather","scarf","kind","blackspraypaint","hawaiianpunchgui","hat","eat","heart","cherbr","karen","black","overact","bite","total","without","digniti","ca","help","sympath","unless","re","certain","friend","mine","ask","hors","lip","mash","time","come","onscreenbr","decent","support","perform","kristin","dattilo","squar","chick","befriend","rainbow","ricki","paull","goldin","trademark","wisecrack","hunk","role","william","larri","darryl","darryl","sanderson","kind","pet","undertak","someth","sad","see","onc","smokin","yvonn","decarlo","reduc","plai","onli","think","charlott","rae","partbr","eighti","heydai","hilari","mindbogglingli","dumb","horror","like","mirror","mirror","last","kind","definit","worth","look"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,8,9,11,12,13,16,18,33,34,36,40,47,53,68,79,81,83,105,107,120,122,125,128,144,154,161,184,185,219,228,229,236,237,306,309,321,392,420,452,455,459,460,526,574,594,599,614,621,632,694,720,774,895,1037,1041,1099,1125,1127,1262,1352,1414,1415,1450,1580,1709,1732,1854,2013,2236,2423,2471,2534,2869,3108,3222,3348,3413,3424,3771,3932,3974,4059,4086,4227,4884,5191,5509,5751,6211,6367,6432,7104,7301,7343,7463],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indice

{"value":"I am very tolerant of really bad sci/fi and horror movies - I've been watching them since I was 4 or 5, so I've seen some really bad stuff, but I deal with it. I've even watched a lot of SciFi Channel movies so I know not to expect much - a usually promising movie that has no ending to speak of. Hope springs eternal, I guess - or the triumph of hope over experience, as they say. Unfortunately, this is a dog right from the beginning and I knew it, but like a moth to the flame, I kept thinking something, anything, interesting would happen. It doesn't. All of the actors give a decent performance - given the script, I don't know how they all kept straight faces. It has something to do with collagen-starved worm parasite creatures who are slowly taking over the human race, one body at a time. There's an evil plastic surgeon who collaborates with the enemy by giving them the outward appearance of humans...don't worry, he gets what's coming to him. The slug people themselves don't really know where they came from, they think they might have thumbed a ride on a meteor that landed on earth, but...somehow they know about the members of slug royalty among them - the slug princess has managed to breed with a human being who knows that she's the worm queen and loves her for her self...oh, must I go on? Please, I implore you, do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this...anything would be better...think of the worst, least enjoyable way you can spend two hours...it would be better than

{"value":"I went into this film with expectations, from the hype, that it would be insightful and uplifting. Certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band \"Wilco.\"<br /><br />Instead we get a lot of moping and whining about \"the process,\" a dishonorable and no doubt one-sided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singer/songwriter, a gut-wrenching confession by the fallen member's friend -- for like 18 years -- saying the \"friendship had run its course,\" and this whiny, uncompelling story about how one record label \"hurt their feelings\" by dumping them, only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other labels (oh, the tension...not!) They tried their best to make it look like it was a strain, but I suspect it was all smoke and mirrors to generate a tragedy that didn't exist. This doesn't even take into account the long stretches where we get many of their newest songs shoved at us in full without any storyline, insight or even a decent job at cinematography. The strained attempts at emotional sincerity or reasonable perspective on life made me sick to watch.<br /><br />From the film, this band sounds like a bunch of vile little babies who poke around to find a voice they don't have and think they're some kind of guardians for the art of music, which they most definitely are not. And I thought the music sucked, and I couldn't even understand the lyrics due to the mumbling style of the lead singer.<br /><br />I give it a

{"value":"Ain't it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him, turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way? That formula never gets old, does it? It's such a sure fire way to make a classic film! Just look at major hits like Liar Liar and Big!... This must have been Rob Schneider's line of thinking when he made semi-successful Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo and followed it with The Animal. Since I've already traced the plot through sarcasm, allow me to color it in more: Schneider plays a loser cop who's suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery... by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts, causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times, run like a cheetah, etc. This movie is slightly more likable than other Schneider-starring flicks (such as another lame same-plot follow-up The Hot Chick), but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality TV star as the romantic lead (Colleen Haskell from \"Survivor\") and inserting a cameo by Norm MacDonald. My favorite scene... just does not exist. Sorry - nothing memorably good except the production value. I just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay, but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way (\"You can DO it!\"), there's a word for that - \"milking.\" Actually, here's another word -

{"value":"This movie is just plain terrible. Poor John Savage had to stoop this low in order to be in another movie. He stars as a rare type of vampire that is to help a lady that looks like a washed out and thrown in the streets hooker that is a dancer at a local strip club. She acidently tastes a drop of blood from another dancer who happens to be one of those rare vampires as they get carried away making out on the floor of the dressing room. Savage is then assigned by a short leader of this rare vampire breed that looks like a cross between 80's punk rock and one of the Olsen twins with purple hair. This movie just gets all to crazy with Savage rapping and dancing with a midget with a tattooed spider on his head, also one of the rare. He quotes the Elephant Man and Jimmy Durante and I just had to laugh. This just gets rediculas. And then the most gross special effects that they could come up with is Corri throwing up her organs and pulling them out of her mouth. And you can tell that that is all to fake. Her son doesn't know what to do with his moms new identity and becomes more of a pest than an object of serenity. I enjoy a good vampire film, believe me I do but I just HATED this one. Even the photography stinks, in and out blurs with the camera switching this way and that trying to make it look like the vampires move to fast for the camera to keep up and then the camera turns all to bright in the scene of Savage chasing the son of Corri around till he blinds himself.

{"value":"Oh dear, oh dear...<br /><br />For JM fans, this was the nail in the coffin as far as her A-list Hollywood career was concerned. After solid turns in Girl Can't Help It, Wayward Bus, The Burglar and Rock Hunter it seemed Jayne was well on the way to becoming one of Tinsel Town's hottest stars. However, an obsession with racy publicity and an appearance in this clunker relegated Mansfield to the sidelines, namely cheap Euro loan-outs until Fox could drop her contract at the earliest opportunity.<br /><br />This movie really is a diabolical waste of everyone's time with the exception of Suzy Parker who is the only thing in this movie bad enough for the material. Many people blame poor Jayne and her grating performance for this film's poor returns at the box office and while she is a pain in this film, she can only do her best with the material. After all, Cary hardly sets the screen on fire does he? After a handful of very good dramatic and comedy turns Jayne takes 10 steps back in her pursuit as a serious actress by agreeing (simply for the sake of appearing with Grant) to portray this squealing, idiotic menace. Her character of Alice is a complete cartoon bimbo and although she looks good enough to eat in a boiler suit, her every appearance in the film jangles your nerves. We all know Jayne could do so much better than this dross and yet here she is parading around like a prize pudding. A real shame.<br /><br />Steer clear of this so-called comedy. It's more depressing than

{"value":"Many people like to point to this TV movie when arguing with the vast legions of Hanks-philes out there that Tom did in fact make crappy films (I think \"Bachelor Party\" was great, but that's another story). The movie focuses on a \"Dungeons and Dragons-style game\" that eventually drives our young Gump to hallucinatory madness. The story is charmingly early 1980s, focusing as it does on the imminent threat to our youth posed by those evil role-playing games.<br /><br />I, however, prefer to view \"Mazes and Monsters\" as the turning point in the \"Whatever Happened to Chris Makepeace?\" story. we all remember him as 'Rudy the Rabbit' in \"Meatballs\" and as the hapless Clifford in \"My Bodyguard\", where he gave us all a vicarious thrill by beating the crap out of Matt Dillon. Few could argue (especially those of us who read \"Dynamite!\" on a regular basis) that great things were in store for him.<br /><br />And then came Rona Jaffe. The line between bad acting and bad writing is razor thin, so I leave it to you to decide whose fault Makepeace's performance in this is. All I know is that the last major release I saw him in was \"Vamp\", and that was 1986. He had a small role as Sean Penn's brother in \"Falcon and the Snowman\", but by that time the Brat Pack torch had been passed to others with straighter hair and flashier resumes.<br /><br />I can't in good conscience recommend this movie. Watch it if only to see a younger, more idealistic Chris Makepeace, before Rona Jaffe feasted on his soul.","finished_norm":["mani","peopl","like","to","point","to","thi","tv","movi","when","argu","with","the","vast","legion","of","hanksphil","out","there","that","tom","do","in","fact","make","crappi","film","i","think","bachelor","parti","be","great","but","that","anoth","stori","the","movi","focu","on","a","dungeon","and","dragonsstyl","game","that","eventu","drive","our","young","gump","to","hallucinatori","mad","the","stori","be","charmingli","earli","focu","a","it","doe","on","the","immin","threat","to","our","youth","pose","by","that","evil","roleplai","gamesbr","br","i","howev","prefer","to","view","maze","and","monster","a","the","turn","point","in","the","whatev","happen","to","chri","makepeac","stori","we","all","rememb","him","a","rudi","the","rabbit","in","meatbal","and","a","the","hapless","clifford","in","my","bodyguard","where","he","give","u","all","a","vicari","thrill","by","beat","the","crap","out","of","matt","dillon","few","can","argu","especi","that","of","u","who","read","dynamit","on","a","regular","basi","that","great","thing","be","in","store","for","himbr","br","and","then","come","rona","jaff","the","line","between","bad","act","and","bad","write","be","razor","thin","so","i","leav","it","to","you","to","decid","whose","fault","makepeac","perform","in","thi","be","all","i","know","be","that","the","last","major","releas","i","see","him","in","be","vamp","and","that","be","he","have","a","small","role","a","sean","penn","brother","in","falcon","and","the","snowman","but","by","that","time","the","brat","pack","torch","have","be","pass","to","other","with","straight","hair","and","flashi","resumesbr","br","i","ca","not","in","good","conscienc","recommend","thi","movi","watch","it","if","onli","to","see","a","young","much","idealist","chri","makepeac","befor","rona","jaff","feast","on","hi","soul"],"filtered":["mani","peopl","like","point","thi","tv","movi","argu","vast","legion","hanksphil","tom","fact","make","crappi","film","think","bachelor","parti","great","anoth","stori","movi","focu","dungeon","dragonsstyl","game","eventu","drive","young","gump","hallucinatori","mad","stori","charmingli","earli","focu","doe","immin","threat","youth","pose","evil","roleplai","gamesbr","br","howev","prefer","view","maze","monster","turn","point","whatev","happen","chri","makepeac","stori","rememb","rudi","rabbit","meatbal","hapless","clifford","bodyguard","give","u","vicari","thrill","beat","crap","matt","dillon","argu","especi","u","read","dynamit","regular","basi","great","thing","store","himbr","br","come","rona","jaff","line","bad","act","bad","write","razor","thin","leav","decid","whose","fault","makepeac","perform","thi","know","last","major","releas","see","vamp","small","role","sean","penn","brother","falcon","snowman","time","brat","pack","torch","pass","straight","hair","flashi","resumesbr","br","ca","good","conscienc","recommend","thi","movi","watch","onli","see","young","much","idealist","chri","makepeac","befor","rona","jaff","feast","hi","soul"],"filtered2":["mani","peopl","like","point","tv","argu","vast","legion","hanksphil","tom","fact","make","crappi","think","bachelor","parti","great","anoth","stori","focu","dungeon","dragonsstyl","game","eventu","drive","young","gump","hallucinatori","mad","stori","charmingli","earli","focu","doe","immin","threat","youth","pose","evil","roleplai","gamesbr","howev","prefer","view","maze","monster","turn","point","whatev","happen","chri","makepeac","stori","rememb","rudi","rabbit","meatbal","hapless","clifford","bodyguard","give","u","vicari","thrill","beat","crap","matt","dillon","argu","especi","u","read","dynamit","regular","basi","great","thing","store","himbr","come","rona","jaff","line","bad","act","bad","write","razor","thin","leav","decid","whose","fault","makepeac","perform","know","last","major","releas","see","vamp","small","role","sean","penn","brother","falcon","snowman","time","brat","pack","torch","pass","straight","hair","flashi","resumesbr","ca","good","conscienc","recommend","watch","onli","see","young","idealist","chri","makepeac","befor","rona","jaff","feast","soul"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,7,8,9,11,12,17,18,21,23,26,29,30,34,50,51,65,66,73,74,79,81,94,96,97,105,107,112,113,128,135,144,145,172,249,266,267,290,298,312,313,321,327,363,374,381,404,408,413,461,487,548,557,598,619,678,716,759,793,813,831,850,980,1006,1077,1140,1218,1268,1298,1459,1507,1640,1759,1811,1906,1939,2032,2850,3510,3592,3685,3732,3757,3789,4025,4141,4447,4510,4721,4819,5095,5288,5373,5381,5460,5551,5685,7685,7752,8207],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it. The fat guy is the best character, as he seems to be a nice guy. The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. Phat Beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. Most low-budget movies have that \"local babe\" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys. Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the \"youngsters\" went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage skank. There were some cuties too. That is the charm of these low-budget crappy movies. You will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit. Too bad. It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a \"Where are they now\" book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. What happened?? There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder \"what ever happened to X?\" Anyhow, this movie mostly blows, but it has some funny moments.","finished_norm":["i","watch","phat","beach","on","cabl","for","a","while","and","i","sort","of","enjoi","it","the","fat","gui","be","the","well","charact","a","he","seem","to","be","a","nice","gui","the","rest","of","the","charact","be","just","variou","stereotyp","of","young","man","and","young","black","man","i","like","to","watch","thi","low","budget","movi","that","captur","a","period","of","time","becaus","thei","be","almost","like","a","documentari","of","the","year","attitud","and","fad","phat","beach","be","conjur","funni","becaus","the","lowbudget","babe","in","thi","movi","be","strictli","homegirl","much","lowbudget","movi","have","that","local","babe","qualiti","and","you","can","tell","the","babe","in","thi","movi","be","the","local","stripper","and","underwear","model","for","jc","pennei","some","of","them","have","so","much","cellulit","hang","from","their","bikini","that","it","be","funni","to","watch","how","the","youngster","go","wild","over","what","be","essenti","some","realli","overus","highmileag","skank","there","be","some","cuti","too","that","be","the","charm","of","thi","lowbudget","crappi","movi","you","will","see","a","lot","of","doggi","and","some","real","cuti","i","check","up","on","some","of","them","at","imdb","and","seven","year","late","phat","beach","be","their","onli","credit","too","bad","it","would","be","interest","if","someon","ever","manag","to","do","a","where","be","thei","now","book","on","all","of","the","cuti","that","have","appear","in","the","histori","of","movi","and","then","be","never","again","to","return","what","happen","there","be","probabl","on","or","two","young","peopl","in","almost","everi","movi","who","seem","to","have","a","lot","go","for","them","and","yet","year","late","when","you","see","the","movi","again","on","tv","you","wonder","what","ever","happen","to","x","anyhow","thi","movi","mostli","blow","but","it","have","some","funni","moment"],"filtered":["watch","phat","beach","cabl","sort","enjoi","fat","gui","well","charact","seem","nice","gui","rest","charact","variou","stereotyp","young","man","young","black","man","like","watch","thi","low","budget","movi","captur","period","time","becaus","thei","almost","like","documentari","year","attitud","fad","phat","beach","conjur","funni","becaus","lowbudget","babe","thi","movi","strictli","homegirl","much","lowbudget","movi","local","babe","qualiti","tell","babe","thi","movi","local","stripper","underwear","model","jc","pennei","much","cellulit","hang","bikini","funni","watch","youngster","go","wild","essenti","realli","overus","highmileag","skank","cuti","charm","thi","lowbudget","crappi","movi","see","lot","doggi","real","cuti","check","imdb","seven","year","late","phat","beach","onli","credit","bad","interest","someon","ever","manag","thei","book","cuti","appear","histori","movi","never","return","happen","probabl","two","young","peopl","almost","everi","movi","seem","lot","go","yet","year","late","see","movi","tv","wonder","ever","happen","x","anyhow","thi","movi","mostli","blow","funni","moment"],"filtered2":["watch","phat","beach","cabl","sort","enjoi","fat","gui","well","charact","seem","nice","gui","rest","charact","variou","stereotyp","young","man","young","black","man","like","watch","low","budget","captur","period","time","becaus","almost","like","documentari","year","attitud","fad","phat","beach","conjur","funni","becaus","lowbudget","babe","strictli","homegirl","lowbudget","local","babe","qualiti","tell","babe","local","stripper","underwear","model","jc","pennei","cellulit","hang","bikini","funni","watch","youngster","go","wild","essenti","realli","overus","highmileag","skank","cuti","charm","lowbudget","crappi","see","lot","doggi","real","cuti","check","imdb","seven","year","late","phat","beach","onli","credit","bad","interest","someon","ever","manag","book","cuti","appear","histori","never","return","happen","probabl","two","young","peopl","almost","everi","seem","lot","go","yet","year","late","see","tv","wonder","ever","happen","x","anyhow","mostli","blow","funni","moment"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,20,22,23,35,39,42,44,45,47,55,57,60,62,72,80,85,90,94,131,135,139,148,150,151,170,172,175,188,194,200,217,226,229,256,262,269,319,345,356,475,488,499,505,510,591,604,624,743,754,797,848,925,942,1077,1105,1107,1151,1197,1222,1509,1533,1822,1872,2001,2335,2608,3528,3748,3837,4295,4749,5285],"values":[2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,20,22,23,35,39,42,44,45,47,55,57,60,62,72,80,85,90,94,131,135,139,148,150,151,170,172,175,188,194,200,217,226,229,256,262,269,319,345,356,475,488,499,505,

{"value":"As a big fan of gorilla movies in general, I anticipated that this one would be great - and as for the gorilla effects, They were quite good, however - that is the only thing I can write about this flop. The film claims to be based on a true story but in effect, it does not even come close to what actually happened to \"Buddy\" - who in real life, was the famous Gargantua, sold to Ringling Bros. by our supposed \"heroic\" Gertrude Lintz, known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had her animals' welfare in the best interest. As far as Buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive, this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla, in real life, resort to such behavior. buddy did, in fact, escape his wooden crate (not a plush cage room as depicted in movie) during a storm, to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which frightened Gertrude Lintz into selling him. No, Buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was abandoned in a wooden crate, deep in the back of a garage for some time with only a single light bulb for comfort and then sold to the circus - where he actually lived a better life having peanuts thrown at him until he died (historically the oldest living gorilla on record, by the way) before a show in Miami. Notice also, in the film, how Buddy grows older but the chimpanzees never age.

{"value":"Ben a out-of-town cop is convinced his sister was brutally killed and wants to bring her killer to justice, but he's approached by Stefan who believes his sister was a victim of a werewolf cult. So Ben, his sister's best friend and Stefan travel to Transylvania to put a end to this evil.<br /><br />This is incredibly awful B-grade stuff and I wondered how it even got released. It makes the original 'Howling' look like a masterpiece. What was Christopher Lee thinking, as this has to be his worst performance I've seen.<br /><br />There was a lot wrong with this real cheap-ass film, ranging from the really hammy and wooden performances from Annie McEnroe, Reb Brown, Marsha A. Hunt and Sybil Danning (not to forgot Lee), cheesy fashion (those sunnies), cheap and lame special effects, bad use of lighting, the humour... if there was any, trashy 80s music (with some of the film just focusing on some unknown band playing), werewolf's having orgies which is a sight to see and a tiresome story with flat and annoying dialogue. I thought if it was that bad it would be awfully funny, but I was wrong. <br /><br />The positives were the location and settings of the film looked great, but that's about it... actually I'll add Sybil Danning short stripping scene too.<br /><br />During the end credits the band plays their crap-house song during a weird montage of scenes from the film, which I beckon the question why?<br
