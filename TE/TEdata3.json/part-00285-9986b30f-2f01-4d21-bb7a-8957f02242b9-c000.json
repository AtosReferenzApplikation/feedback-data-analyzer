{"value":"102 Dalmatians (2000, Dir. Kevin Lima) <br /><br />Believed to be cured, Cruella de Vil (Close) is released from prison and sets out to make a new start in life. Things are going well for Cruella who is busy helping homeless dogs off the street. When the clock strikes on Big Ben, things turn bad. The hypnotic cure is reversed and Cruella is back, and this time she is determined to make that spotted coat she always wanted.<br /><br />Glenn Close reprises her role as Cruella de Vil and once again is the highlight of the film. Every scene with her in is worth watching in this dull sequel, which feels more of a repeat of the previous film, rather than a new story.<br /><br />She's Changed.

{"value":"This is a bad movie. Not one of the funny bad ones either. This is a lousy bad one. It was actually painful to watch. The direction was awful,with lots of jumping around and the green and yellow hues used throughout the movie makes the characters look sickly. Keira Knightly was not convincing as a tough chick at all,and I cannot believe Lucy Liu and Mickey Rourke signed on for this criminal waste of celluloid. The script was terrible and the acting was like fingernails across a chalkboard. If you haven't seen it,don't. You are not missing anything and will only waste two hours of your life watching this drivel .I have seen bad movies before and even enjoyed them due to their faults. This one is just a waste of

{"value":"It seems that the intention of the film was to show the aggressive (maffia-like) character of Russians, or at least of those Russians able to travel outside their big country; that it is too easy to rob a bank in England; and that British police is so inefficient that it cannot find the person who robbed the bank even when these subjects are leaving the country by air. In addition, Nicole Kidman and the supposed Russian colleagues spoke a language not yet identified anywhere, probably spoken by Aliens in the Ural mountains, but far to be the Russian one. So Nicole, if you really want to talk Russian, kindly go to Moscow or St. Petersburg and keep yourself busy learning Russian language grammar and its pronunciation.","finished_norm":["it","seem","that","the","intent","of","the","film","be","to","show","the","aggress","maffialik","charact","of","russian","or","at","littl","of","that","russian","abl","to","travel","outsid","their","big","countri","that","it","be","too","easi","to","rob","a","bank","in","england","and","that","british","polic","be","so","ineffici","that","it","cannot","find","the","person","who","rob","the","bank","even","when","thi","subject","be","leav","the","countri","by","air","in","addit","nicol","kidman","and","the","suppos","russian","colleagu","speak","a","languag","not","yet","identifi","anywher","probabl","speak","by","alien","in","the","ural","mountain","but","far","to","be","the","russian","on","so","nicol","if","you","realli","want","to","talk","russian","kindli","go","to","moscow","or","st","petersburg","and","keep","yourself","busi","learn","russian","languag","grammar","and","it","pronunci"],"filtered":["seem","intent","film","show","aggress","maffialik","charact","russian","littl","russian","abl","travel","outsid","big","countri","easi","rob","bank","england","british","polic","ineffici","find","person","rob","bank","even","thi","subject","leav","countri","air","addit","nicol","kidman","suppos","russian","colleagu","speak","languag","yet","identifi","anywher","probabl","speak","alien","ural","mountain","far","russian","nicol","realli","want","talk","russian","kindli","go","moscow","st","petersburg","keep","busi","learn","russian","languag","grammar","pronunci"],"filtered2":["seem","intent","show","aggress","maffialik","charact","russian","littl","russian","abl","travel","outsid","big","countri","easi","rob","bank","england","british","polic","ineffici","find","person","rob","bank","even","subject","leav","countri","air","addit","nicol","kidman","suppos","russian","colleagu","speak","languag","yet","identifi","anywher","probabl","speak","alien","ural","mountain","far","russian","nicol","realli","want","talk","russian","kindli","go","moscow","st","petersburg","keep","busi","learn","russian","languag","grammar","pronunci"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,10,13,14,28,35,37,38,74,82,101,134,148,149,153,186,194,344,430,454,471,550,565,608,679,696,744,790,791,811,1032,1094,1127,1185,1234,1265,1292,1559,1667,1999,2451,3341,3399,5166,6011,7485],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,10,13,14,28,35,37,38,74,82,101,134,148,149,153,186,194,344,430,454,471,550,565,608,679,696,744,790,791,811,1032,1094,1127,1185,1234,1265,1292,1559,1667,1999,2451,3341,3399,5166,6011,7485],"values":[0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.5452294193519092,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.9486336368009016,2.020196584395323,2.098582041218749,2.2443961816702407,2.3018654096236517,2.3253197803590226,2.3409902041158843,2.571852579609833,2.5378812223426954,5.966186995892774,3.2189558216683714,3.2556198060399626,3.496027715008137,3.4751392270607813,3.9081109809587793,7.232905520254718,3.6715125373103863,3.8095464139032247,3.700222643192818,3.749984152751882,3.8240921249056035,3.8425769395797067,4.140259095366071,8.437256324963155,4.315570107673808,4.235066888824737,28.45329622716852,9.521470171257315,4.3336974922663645,9.259085750714613,4.8796870284900224,4.9909126636002465,5.143104478942172,5.626901430320244,5.626901430320244,12.685042933464494,6.437831646536572,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.8660108459984914E-5,5.826454963502537E-5,5.8717500950326184E-5,5.8378230604296715E-5,5.8379187065878614E-5,5.829758462875121E-5,5.8470969813684635E-5,5.8272939349460846E-5,5.840395816012437E-5,0.12219681389353053,0.25654798930050815,5.8178873977586826E-5,5.926475380964511E-5,6.011017854534133E-5,5.8221297405575106E-5,5.806039885967063E-5,5.9508642881625315E-5,5.847644810219879E-5,5.8295025149759916E-5,5.834334136093008E-5,5.890784740765479E-5,5.853438346494818E-5,5.8601033740565257E-5,5.866416978178072E-5,5.9114387146320776E-5,5.880523554351913E-5,6.127729593224087E-5,5.819617002338038E-5,5.8197726907216804E-5,5.8345170519227175E-5,5.9585283459861106E-5,5.8473059891377035E-5,6.276587643985598E-5,5.863753598018137E-5,5.8259513937300336E-5,5.8528419999187975E-5,5.8201136448440546E-5,5.8235529037951156E-5,5.806010715953238E-5,5.807517062997913E-5,5.820589078101736E-5,5.88198395940363E-5,5.8520951271101735E-5,5.828957578866561E-5,5.899785525485073E-5,5.83119476463752E-5,6.024936410082852E-5,0.06328144645527034,5.808960548473091E-5,5.821798706527534E-5,5.819779487398851E-5,5.983569958970937E-5,5.8218853237935225E-5,5.8070014881908536E-5,0.1040965610760723,5.823384886902595E-5,0.3579348245366383,5.8185856610799105E-5,5.808893371176842E-5,5.83662913211404E-5,5.894523587770306E-5,0.091603813794686

{"value":"This has to be one of the worst films of the 1990s. When my friends & I were watching this film (being the target audience it was aimed at) we just sat & watched the first half an hour with our jaws touching the floor at how bad it really was. The rest of the time, everyone else in the theatre just started talking to each other, leaving or generally crying into their popcorn that they actually paid money they had earnt working to watch this feeble excuse for a film. It must have looked like a great idea on paper, but on film it looks like no-one in the film has a clue what is going on. Crap acting, crap costumes.

{"value":"this could be one of the worse movies i've ever seen. i don't see how could this ever be described as a horror movie, or even a thriller? its more like a lumbering drama. the scary music is EXCELLENT but since there weren't any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs. the movie had so much potential. they had beautiful cinematography (sp?) and interesting characters, but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them. they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant. this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different.","finished_norm":["thi","can","be","on","of","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","i","do","not","see","how","can","thi","ever","be","describ","a","a","horror","movi","or","even","a","thriller","it","much","like","a","lumber","drama","the","scari","music","be","excel","but","sinc","there","be","not","ani","scari","situat","the","director","think","it","would","be","a","good","idea","to","us","it","for","everydai","activ","like","take","a","dump","or","walk","down","stair","the","movi","have","so","much","potenti","thei","have","beauti","cinematographi","sp","and","interest","charact","but","it","seem","a","if","the","writer","assum","you","alreadi","know","them","thei","would","undergo","peculiar","activ","without","explan","or","even","a","clue","at","what","thei","mean","thi","be","simpli","on","of","that","movi","that","sai","it","about","on","thing","and","it","someth","total","differ"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","movi","ever","see","see","thi","ever","describ","horror","movi","even","thriller","much","like","lumber","drama","scari","music","excel","sinc","ani","scari","situat","director","think","good","idea","us","everydai","activ","like","take","dump","walk","stair","movi","much","potenti","thei","beauti","cinematographi","sp","interest","charact","seem","writer","assum","alreadi","know","thei","undergo","peculiar","activ","without","explan","even","clue","thei","mean","thi","simpli","movi","sai","thing","someth","total","differ"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","see","see","ever","describ","horror","even","thriller","like","lumber","drama","scari","music","excel","sinc","ani","scari","situat","director","think","good","idea","us","everydai","activ","like","take","dump","walk","stair","potenti","beauti","cinematographi","sp","interest","charact","seem","writer","assum","alreadi","know","undergo","peculiar","activ","without","explan","even","clue","mean","simpli","thing","someth","total","differ"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,10,12,25,26,27,29,31,35,44,53,56,58,60,83,88,118,123,125,162,184,201,204,287,294,325,330,396,463,473,547,580,629,668,714,920,1000,1038,1699,2166,3685,3784,4887,5650,5995,8358],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,5,10,12,25,26,27,29,31,35,44,53,56,58,60,83,88,118,123,125,162,184,201,204,287,294,325,330,396,463,473,547,580,629,668,714,920,1000,1038,1699,2166,3685,3784,4887,5650,5995,8358],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.463169012899134,3.209458785004948,1.7003182735607676,1.8610609350701788,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,2.292318797740072,2.0317223413467334,2.354379525480895,2.2619070973220485,2.2242236634876535,2.3586007221245198,2.496249838866882,2.561435818751577,2.624524614047584,2.841890188081905,2.886778509330039,2.973659465713028,2.9292757465539174,6.583053029006414,3.3467891931782563,3.335489637924323,3.432149042129413,3.5039747767006686,3.488143311483988,3.5813614403160887,3.7297814454343623,3.952924996748572,4.062925891962901,4.165705761027235,9.466167108596293,5.039114765418124,5.770002273960917,5.770002273960917,6.101359409915359,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.09664437388613463,7.935738115307073E-5,7.997430912037288E-5,7.951221671028052E-5,7.951351942843056E-5,7.940237541810689E-5,7.96385292079027E-5,7.936880809742012E-5,7.954725811138534E-5,8.825337292532481E-5,0.8217710829851957,7.924068934226158E-5,8.071967751360892E-5,8.187116145036191E-5,7.929847082629904E-5,7.907932406700375E-5,8.105185888573724E-5,7.964599073695266E-5,7.939888936095657E-5,7.946469692335466E-5,8.023356447306993E-5,7.972489975955294E-5,7.981567865270895E-5,7.990167109440148E-5,8.051487537081553E-5,0.07542149359421883,8.346079665569241E-5,7.926424687264804E-5,7.926636737687904E-5,7.94671882703758E-5,8.115624475359252E-5,7.964137593190752E-5,8.548827050488236E-5,7.986539536999763E-5,7.935052244076212E-5,7.971677741022919E-5,7.927101123432142E-5,7.931785456962104E-5,7.90789267660858E-5,7.909944348805857E-5,7.927748672215732E-5,8.011369622293293E-5,7.970660486611478E-5,7.939146723158098E-5,8.035615680548197E-5,7.942193811053711E-5,8.206073471999135E-5,8.085400769660184E-5,7.911910402396937E-5,7.929396208232762E-5,7.926645994886392E-5,8.149731609779287E-5,7.92951418253162E-5,7.909242126498587E-5,7.996057377834425E-5,7.931556614884658E-5,8.529517438689193E-5,7.925019981627623E-5,7.911818905692052E-5,7.949595518847927E-5,8.028448825239948E-5,7.949069607886307E-5,7.910355201506645E-5,7.928773252064646E-5,7.907988323970329E-5,8.090962782968189E-5,7.976111931208723E-5,7.959121644989694E-5,7.95216

{"value":"TV pilots, don't you love them? Quinn Martin tried this one out after being successful in a bunch of other TV detective movies, but this one goes nowhere except in the realm of MST where it belongs. Roy Thinnes is Diamond Head who takes orders from Aunt Mary to find super spy Lovejoy, I mean Tree. Zulu and Tso-Tsing are there for ethnic comic relief and not much else. Tree sucks as a bad guy despite all his disguises that makes him look exactly the same as he normally does. There's more unnatural clothing fiber here than you can ever imagine (required in the 1970's)and the show itself is so anti-climatic. Why did it not go to series?

{"value":"This is possibly the worst fencing, sword-fighting, movie ever made. That is not just because the so called sports fencing is poor but because the plot, characters are so weak that they've got to throw in a semi nude sex scene and, later, supposed group dancing around a fencing scene in the fencing club trying, I suppose to maintain audience interest. What a waste of F. Murray Abraham's talents. You're better served with overblown swashbuckling movies like Zorro, Scaramouche, anything that has Basil Rathbone as the villain. As a fencer myself I recognize the near impossibility of capturing fencing as a sport on film, but if it ever happens it's got to have fresher, better drawn characters and a plot with more depth.","finished_norm":["thi","be","possibli","the","wrong","fenc","swordfight","movi","ever","make","that","be","not","just","becaus","the","so","call","sport","fenc","be","poor","but","becaus","the","plot","charact","be","so","weak","that","thei","have","get","to","throw","in","a","semi","nude","sex","scene","and","late","suppos","group","danc","around","a","fenc","scene","in","the","fenc","club","try","i","suppos","to","maintain","audienc","interest","what","a","wast","of","f","murrai","abraham","talent","you","re","well","serv","with","overblown","swashbuckl","movi","like","zorro","scaramouch","anyth","that","have","basil","rathbon","a","the","villain","a","a","fencer","myself","i","recogn","the","near","imposs","of","captur","fenc","a","a","sport","on","film","but","if","it","ever","happen","it","get","to","have","fresh","well","draw","charact","and","a","plot","with","much","depth"],"filtered":["thi","possibli","wrong","fenc","swordfight","movi","ever","make","becaus","call","sport","fenc","poor","becaus","plot","charact","weak","thei","get","throw","semi","nude","sex","scene","late","suppos","group","danc","around","fenc","scene","fenc","club","try","suppos","maintain","audienc","interest","wast","f","murrai","abraham","talent","re","well","serv","overblown","swashbuckl","movi","like","zorro","scaramouch","anyth","basil","rathbon","villain","fencer","recogn","near","imposs","captur","fenc","sport","film","ever","happen","get","fresh","well","draw","charact","plot","much","depth"],"filtered2":["possibli","wrong","fenc","swordfight","ever","make","becaus","call","sport","fenc","poor","becaus","plot","charact","weak","get","throw","semi","nude","sex","scene","late","suppos","group","danc","around","fenc","scene","fenc","club","try","suppos","maintain","audienc","interest","wast","f","murrai","abraham","talent","re","well","serv","overblown","swashbuckl","like","zorro","scaramouch","anyth","basil","rathbon","villain","fencer","recogn","near","imposs","captur","fenc","sport","ever","happen","get","fresh","well","draw","charact","plot","depth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,10,19,20,22,25,32,36,44,60,68,89,94,98,104,142,146,149,150,168,254,276,310,379,410,492,520,555,558,576,815,901,914,924,1035,1096,1568,1658,1676,1867,2700,3126,3523,4559,4567,4736],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,10,19,20,22,25,32,36,44,60,68,89,94,98,104,142,146,149,150,168,254,276,310,379,410,492,520,555,558,576,815,901,914,924,1035,1096,1568,1658,1676,1867,2700,3126,3523,4559,4567,4736],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.5932680941439847,2.247774048205673,2.62476135602347,2.330690080046114,2.5958480334723544,1.2796387880827016,2.742262257014735,1.4680183469605717,3.209458785004948,1.838176641236591,2.0064197866819473,1.9940046109572438,2.08112281984698,2.0881990796736947,2.0728240170322856,2.2844323215331563,2.326138445979858,4.650639560718045,2.332712011146513,2.4894767118610357,2.889652074525771,2.7884729505849193,2.854312708080462,3.1272886331425473,3.2070272508030975,3.6016814428070463,3.5614461306151473,3.432149042129413,3.4572130107926293,3.587125145032839,3.7881170224473255,3.8962296530720266,3.9612932464190886,3.969732115064953,4.2860694432771105,4.429617614145104,4.597282013139085,4.637773374493822,9.540249651956993,4.8184434032493035,5.259176650194926,5.850044981634453,30.506797049576797,6.101359409915359,6.032366538428407,6.032366538428407]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.548918221301393E-5,6.50475733472306E-5,6.555325620394735E-5,6.517448879123871E-5,6.517555660185927E-5,6.508445419829471E-5,6.527802448425639E-5,6.505693977275902E-5,6.52032114894356E-5,7.233940384445705E-5,0.5726348306237742,6.495192352849493E-5,6.616421897168545E-5,6.710806609397926E-5,6.499928579355995E-5,6.481965581217772E-5,6.643650104367599E-5,6.528414054241137E-5,6.508159675069647E-5,6.513553782309193E-5,6.576576235429138E-5,6.534882060569936E-5,6.54232301517951E-5,6.549371634447216E-5,6.599634697022253E-5,6.565120465496184E-5,6.841105657969886E-5,6.497123313981812E-5,6.497297127245927E-5,6.513757992775488E-5,6.652206394024681E-5,6.528035788394538E-5,7.007293417694958E-5,6.546398189747304E-5,6.504195140525772E-5,6.53421628870888E-5,6.497677774456318E-5,6.50151742395641E-5,6.481933015298604E-5,6.483614727771945E-5,6.498208556550994E-5,6.566750887516319E-5,6.533382466700398E-5,6.507551298762445E-5,6.586624870626662E-5,6.510048932511258E-5,6.726345530896746E-5,6.627432659247658E-5,6.485226260477688E-5,6.499559007112149E-5,6.497304715176488E-5,6.680163293504159E-5,6.499655708159318E-5,6.483039130941827E-5,6.554199763347697E-5,6.501329846927011E-5,6.991465735738292E-5,6.495971906366816E-5,6.485151262556443E-5,6.51611595644329E-5,6.580750350329261E-5,6.51568487830849E-5,6.483951495074507E-

{"value":"This really was a waste of time...the movie has a weak plot, the story is fragmented and ends very abruptly with many loopholes....though the animation is top notch. <br /><br />Once the movie started, I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might get interesting in the later stage, but it was never unique. This same plot has been played over and over again, but what made it worse was that the major plot hole was the whole story on how to kill the baddies...The writer could have done so much more with the entire concept, but seemed that he or she did not have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started.<br /><br />Overall, too much hype but not able to deliver.","finished_norm":["thi","realli","be","a","wast","of","timeth","movi","have","a","weak","plot","the","stori","be","fragment","and","end","veri","abruptli","with","mani","loopholesthough","the","anim","be","top","notch","br","br","onc","the","movi","start","i","try","to","give","it","the","benefit","of","the","doubt","by","tell","myself","that","it","mai","get","interest","in","the","late","stage","but","it","be","never","uniqu","thi","same","plot","have","be","plai","over","and","over","again","but","what","make","it","wrong","be","that","the","major","plot","hole","be","the","whole","stori","on","how","to","kill","the","baddiesth","writer","can","have","do","so","much","much","with","the","entir","concept","but","seem","that","he","or","she","do","not","have","their","heart","in","it","and","want","to","close","the","movi","a","soon","a","it","startedbr","br","overal","too","much","hyp","but","not","abl","to","deliv"],"filtered":["thi","realli","wast","timeth","movi","weak","plot","stori","fragment","end","veri","abruptli","mani","loopholesthough","anim","top","notch","br","br","onc","movi","start","try","give","benefit","doubt","tell","mai","get","interest","late","stage","never","uniqu","thi","plot","plai","make","wrong","major","plot","hole","whole","stori","kill","baddiesth","writer","much","much","entir","concept","seem","heart","want","close","movi","soon","startedbr","br","overal","much","hyp","abl","deliv"],"filtered2":["realli","wast","timeth","weak","plot","stori","fragment","end","veri","abruptli","mani","loopholesthough","anim","top","notch","onc","start","try","give","benefit","doubt","tell","mai","get","interest","late","stage","never","uniqu","plot","plai","make","wrong","major","plot","hole","whole","stori","kill","baddiesth","writer","entir","concept","seem","heart","want","close","soon","startedbr","overal","hyp","abl","deliv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,13,15,17,24,25,30,32,35,36,37,40,42,46,50,60,71,76,89,90,111,150,198,236,277,287,295,364,379,404,412,449,454,517,567,614,669,726,810,1301,1600,2452,3849,4050,5442],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,13,15,17,24,25,30,32,35,36,37,40,42,46,50,60,71,76,89,90,111,150,198,236,277,287,295,364,379,404,412,449,454,517,567,614,669,726,810,1301,1600,2452,3849,4050,5442],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,2.5541073880211935,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,4.1133933855221025,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,1.6284968758320737,1.6219954307453837,1.655771293751733,1.717994385570355,1.838176641236591,1.9214926742550966,2.1337665533324026,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,2.1183455303375887,2.332712011146513,2.5439726117360975,2.617923930016232,3.1163992333432793,2.841890188081905,2.7910771187233068,2.9878441007049847,3.1272886331425473,3.1419947805322432,3.107414446935464,3.2597778161886266,3.2556198060399626,3.4198487640477615,3.454678155189441,3.553030933689863,3.7099788181381825,3.7034641371169887,3.8425769395797067,4.3773181147422555,4.662879295624898,5.116075806554253,5.7446844659766265,5.7959777603641776,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.716482158260232E-5,9.650961647538988E-5,9.725988671682373E-5,9.669791805522964E-5,9.669950234174728E-5,9.65643357617264E-5,9.685153162619731E-5,9.652351322954961E-5,9.67405332742836E-5,0.17945431930589514,0.8129633133430312,9.636770299811313E-5,9.816635838611096E-5,9.956672305917456E-5,9.643797332184113E-5,9.617146037264717E-5,9.857033715101671E-5,9.686060588364468E-5,9.656009623121645E-5,9.664012738289935E-5,9.757517729590322E-5,9.695657023373973E-5,9.706696999788579E-5,9.717154877111321E-5,9.791729048634997E-5,9.740521062293327E-5,1.0149994063481891E-4,9.639635223262248E-5,9.639893106079315E-5,9.66431572074982E-5,9.869728488953561E-5,9.68549936386519E-5,1.0396563091789137E-4,9.71274324431962E-5,9.65012753269699E-5,9.694669232689952E-5,9.640457863754303E-5,9.646154665058108E-5,9.617097719945448E-5,9.61959283878651E-5,9.641245373168619E-5,9.742940082646575E-5,9.693432109795023E-5,9.655106988925479E-5,9.772426662838873E-5,9.658812671747915E-5,9.979727053037491E-5,9.832972257799009E-5,9.62198383349032E-5,9.643249006187029E-5,9.639904364120631E-5,9.911207509734286E-5,9.643392479348204E-5,9.618738838760674E-5,9.724318262991864E-5,9.645876361253134E-5,1.0373079917295013E-4,9.637926905770727E-5,9.621872560767242E-5,9.667814178225363E-5,9.76371076965939E-5,9.667174597326036E-5,9.620092492832608E-5,9.642491404814702E-5,9.617214040444752E-5,9.839736439824511E-5,9.700061824884814E-5,9.679399272983778E-5,9.670934200854486E-5,9.706186293298853E-5,9.616863189224147E-5,9.671136947459705E-5,9.827996368615422E-5,9.634097142236681E-5,9.872536026824014E-5,9.65956871

Gina Phillips is actually good, but it's hard playing across from a mystified Dunaway playing Lady Macbeth lost in the Marx's Brother's Duck Soup. Ah, the Raven...now there's an actor. And there is the relative who just lies and bed and looks ghostly. Or Dr. Dread who's filled with lots of gloom and no working remedies.

{"value":"This foolish, implausible tale is redeemed only by the opening scene in which a hard-boiled police detective delivers some nearly-audible lines confirming our greatest fears: He is dead. Perhaps the film would have been saved had the director forgone the dazzling star power of A. Martinez in favor of this sadly-anonymous actor who filled the screen for a brief moment. That a no-name hack-tor off the street could salvage such a dishwater film is no less likely than a villain committing murder by dropping stones into a quarry for an unsuspecting diver.

{"value":"It makes sense to me that this film is getting raves from Hollywood because oftentimes in Hollywood it's all just a popularity contest. It also makes sense when you think that people who are liking the film may just be reacting to the countless songs being spit out at you rather than story content. Yet, this film is overrated and overblown. Eddie Murphy looks just ridiculous. No way do Jeniffer Hudson and Beyonce Knowles give the Oscar rated performance so many have raved over BEFORE the film was even out. I can't even believe that Condon is being set up to be nominated for a Directing Oscar when all he did was put together an album. Glitz does not replace a nothing storyline. A bunch of songs does not a movie make.","finished_norm":["it","make","sens","to","me","that","thi","film","be","get","rave","from","hollywood","becaus","oftentim","in","hollywood","it","all","just","a","popular","contest","it","conjur","make","sens","when","you","think","that","peopl","who","be","like","the","film","mai","just","be","react","to","the","countless","song","be","spit","out","at","you","rather","than","stori","content","yet","thi","film","be","overr","and","overblown","eddi","murphi","look","just","ridicul","no","wai","do","jeniff","hudson","and","beyonc","knowl","give","the","oscar","rate","perform","so","mani","have","rave","over","befor","the","film","be","even","out","i","ca","not","even","believ","that","condon","be","be","set","up","to","be","nomin","for","a","direct","oscar","when","all","he","do","be","put","togeth","a","album","glitz","doe","not","replac","a","noth","storylin","a","bunch","of","song","doe","not","a","movi","make"],"filtered":["make","sens","thi","film","get","rave","hollywood","becaus","oftentim","hollywood","popular","contest","conjur","make","sens","think","peopl","like","film","mai","react","countless","song","spit","rather","stori","content","yet","thi","film","overr","overblown","eddi","murphi","look","ridicul","wai","jeniff","hudson","beyonc","knowl","give","oscar","rate","perform","mani","rave","befor","film","even","ca","even","believ","condon","set","nomin","direct","oscar","put","togeth","album","glitz","doe","replac","noth","storylin","bunch","song","doe","movi","make"],"filtered2":["make","sens","get","rave","hollywood","becaus","oftentim","hollywood","popular","contest","conjur","make","sens","think","peopl","like","mai","react","countless","song","spit","rather","stori","content","yet","overr","overblown","eddi","murphi","look","ridicul","wai","jeniff","hudson","beyonc","knowl","give","oscar","rate","perform","mani","rave","befor","even","ca","even","believ","condon","set","nomin","direct","oscar","put","togeth","album","glitz","doe","replac","noth","storylin","bunch","song","doe","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,12,16,17,18,22,23,30,33,39,46,49,50,79,81,91,102,105,109,159,160,173,194,202,270,274,300,328,419,515,951,979,1142,1202,1618,1795,1910,2111,2153,2215,2251,2476,2516,3642,4643,4736,7629],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,12,16,17,18,22,23,30,33,39,46,49,50,79,81,91,102,105,109,159,160,173,194,202,270,274,300,328,419,515,951,979,1142,1202,1618,1795,1910,2111,2153,2215,2251,2476,2516,3642,4643,4736,7629],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,1.852034211452262,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,2.430631986809635,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3364419891718522,1.4018535447685214,1.5538940054862738,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,1.717994385570355,1.9469506069506084,1.949757232424728,2.0105926690411424,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.125691139326857,2.300267965194495,2.3722295531801256,4.8737648638280495,2.5378812223426954,2.597304642813496,2.731603554088023,2.748952192422636,5.864548499100348,6.310084991849437,3.1758963322079246,3.3956930001684253,4.004218291136122,8.19205168077849,4.263079925052412,4.315570107673808,5.089758498236879,4.8796870284900224,5.390512652256013,4.9909126636002465,10.370137356082408,5.00274712124725,5.463272006538442,5.185068678041204,5.143104478942172,6.101359409915359,6.214688095222362,6.032366538428407,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.143521829640162E-5,7.095351391923824E-5,0.07911427042344651,7.109195254591731E-5,7.109311730751916E-5,7.099374333664266E-5,0.05678872224082673,7.096373076161847E-5,7.11232830977187E-5,7.890740012987134E-5,0.5847445419228726,7.084917965439478E-5,7.217154445874318E-5,7.32010873991357E-5,7.090084213710723E-5,7.070490280027324E-5,0.17834566220591658,7.121156003706176E-5,7.099062644945531E-5,0.03938653361949706,7.173691030263769E-5,7.128211267315019E-5,7.136327817238325E-5,7.144016410057198E-5,7.198843065788135E-5,7.161195143183485E-5,7.462238182731712E-5,7.087024246589247E-5,7.087213841084787E-5,7.10516925727287E-5,7.256187966498079E-5,7.120743393525186E-5,7.643514822521412E-5,7.140772993907345E-5,7.09473815376981E-5,7.127485047249001E-5,7.087629048843523E-5,7.091817316141297E-5,7.070454757312484E-5,7.072289159477627E-5,7.088208022859074E-5,7.162973598021183E-5,7.126575519061544E-5,7.098399031615164E-5,7.184652022975225E-5,7.10112343595252E-5,7.337058504925879E-5,7.229164920981072E-5,7.074047009961271E-5,7.08968108646095E-5,7.087222117955221E-5,7.286683189521496E-5,7.08978656739964E-5,7.07166130180983E-5,7.1492829049242E-5,7.091612708210802E-5,7.626250079284538E-5,7.085768297873049E-5,7.073965202665852E-5,7.107741310299834E-5,7.17824413047068E-5,7.107271092782656E-5,7.07265650

{"value":"Falsely accused, skirt-chasing chums John Wayne (as John Scott) and Eddy Chandler (as Kansas Charlie) change identities to become \"Alias Smith and Jones\". Mr. Wayne becomes \"John Jones\". Mr. Chandler's is supposed to be \"Rev. Smith\", but Wayne calls him \"Dr. Smith\". At no time are either of them as entertaining as Roger Davis, Pete Duel, Jonathan Harris, or Ben Murphy; although, Wayne can be considered infinitely more successful than any of them, career wise. Pretty blonde Mary Kornman (as Anne), grown-up from her days in \"Our Gang\", is a lovely interest for Wayne. She and Chandler have a couple of cute scenes with Wayne. If you're not a fan of low budget John Wayne films of the 1930s, this movie won't make you one.","finished_norm":["fals","accus","skirtchas","chum","john","wayn","a","john","scott","and","eddi","chandler","a","kansa","charli","chang","ident","to","becom","alia","smith","and","jone","mr","wayn","becom","john","jone","mr","chandler","be","suppos","to","be","rev","smith","but","wayn","call","him","dr","smith","at","no","time","be","either","of","them","a","entertain","a","roger","davi","pete","duel","jonathan","harri","or","ben","murphi","although","wayn","can","be","consid","infinit","much","success","than","ani","of","them","career","wise","pretti","blond","mari","kornman","a","ann","grownup","from","her","dai","in","our","gang","be","a","love","interest","for","wayn","she","and","chandler","have","a","coupl","of","cute","scene","with","wayn","if","you","re","not","a","fan","of","low","budget","john","wayn","film","of","the","thi","movi","wo","not","make","you","on"],"filtered":["fals","accus","skirtchas","chum","john","wayn","john","scott","eddi","chandler","kansa","charli","chang","ident","becom","alia","smith","jone","mr","wayn","becom","john","jone","mr","chandler","suppos","rev","smith","wayn","call","dr","smith","time","either","entertain","roger","davi","pete","duel","jonathan","harri","ben","murphi","although","wayn","consid","infinit","much","success","ani","career","wise","pretti","blond","mari","kornman","ann","grownup","dai","gang","love","interest","wayn","chandler","coupl","cute","scene","wayn","re","fan","low","budget","john","wayn","film","thi","movi","wo","make"],"filtered2":["fals","accus","skirtchas","chum","john","wayn","john","scott","eddi","chandler","kansa","charli","chang","ident","becom","alia","smith","jone","mr","wayn","becom","john","jone","mr","chandler","suppos","rev","smith","wayn","call","dr","smith","time","either","entertain","roger","davi","pete","duel","jonathan","harri","ben","murphi","although","wayn","consid","infinit","success","ani","career","wise","pretti","blond","mari","kornman","ann","grownup","dai","gang","love","interest","wayn","chandler","coupl","cute","scene","wayn","re","fan","low","budget","john","wayn","wo","make"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,8,19,27,54,60,68,78,115,132,140,142,149,195,207,217,237,253,256,278,291,317,357,406,511,532,739,854,855,923,930,985,997,1010,1195,1286,1479,1490,1528,1608,1618,1635,1771,1804,2011,2053,2251,4265,4318,4836,5039,6293,6306,6637,7155],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,8,19,27,54,60,68,78,115,132,140,142,149,195,207,217,237,253,256,278,291,317,357,406,511,532,739,854,855,923,930,985,997,1010,1195,1286,1479,1490,1528,1608,1618,1635,1771,1804,2011,2053,2251,4265,4318,4836,5039,6293,6306,6637,7155],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9418936859054116,1.312380678011735,1.3002700588679295,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,2.0064197866819473,2.0064197866819473,4.40310717685161,2.253494045787767,2.317169775997098,2.2844323215331563,2.3253197803590226,2.51289241584188,2.5531798379045583,2.6113665294700725,2.640097787510554,2.7073305177318163,2.748952192422636,2.8336934208777267,12.067326550312949,2.8529247828056143,6.565922303288567,3.121829110937649,3.3909310864081816,3.4446025032006995,4.004218291136122,4.291900363587903,3.9201351739255808,4.3521595551061,4.3095999406873045,4.170873731185678,4.263079925052412,4.34596758485818,8.845857251988615,4.733083554298147,4.715065048795469,5.02684467282631,14.545789324259973,4.605250182788262,5.089758498236879,4.654440426979034,5.102830579804232,4.8085911068062925,38.11205911468402,5.02684467282631,5.463272006538442,6.2980697041614135,6.0662680901040895,6.0662680901040895,20.383519771425913,6.489124940924123,6.600350576034347,6.600350576034347,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[4.321307796980033E-5,4.2921682082657036E-5,0.9545052893407292,4.300542731800988E-5,4.300613191351778E-5,4.2946017935369964E-5,4.307374541000373E-5,4.2927862524418266E-5,4.302438000843512E-5,4.773320101099384E-5,0.028319310061516632,4.28585674897556E-5,4.365850139851368E-5,4.4281299514309186E-5,4.2889819510072855E-5,4.27712905541617E-5,4.383816689454071E-5,4.307778109481437E-5,4.2944132446779565E-5,4.297972549724121E-5,4.339557954954285E-5,4.3120460275153874E-5,4.316955946082814E-5,4.321606981928766E-5,4.354773095302898E-5,4.331998857976915E-5,4.5141078603780244E-5,4.2871308948901655E-5,4.2872455856815395E-5,4.2981072981284225E-5,4.3894625625523335E-5,4.307528510525243E-5,4.623766957895338E-5,4.319644952578053E-5,4.2917972440719145E-5,4.311606717535179E-5,4.2874967559821254E-5,4.2900303511136775E-5,4.277107566773975E-5,4.278217245804581E-5,4.2878469928802995E-5,4.3330746929697936E-5,4.3110565195597585E-5,4.294011807189966E-5,0.01384220295686921,4.295659872386084E-5,4.4383833185307096E-5,4.373115598117192E-5,4.27928061667150

{"value":"Interesting to read comments by viewers regarding Omega Code... many of the overwhelmingly positive comments were lifted almost word for word from TBN broadcasts... the movie looks as if it were made to go directly to video, to be stocked besides the three-part rapture series that was done by some other religious group in the 70s.. dont remember it? You wont remember this one either in a year or two. This is the first movie I have ever seen where it was implied that it was your religious duty to go to it and buy as many tickets as possible to save souls... very shameful... this just goes to show that if you are a televangelist's son, you too can play high-roller Hollywood producer with lil ole ladies tithe

{"value":"Scary, but mostly in the sense that will it be over before I turn 70. I saw this as a late night re-run in about 1976 and thought it would never end. Like crackers, it's better than nothing (but just).<br /><br />Ray Milland is a little scary because he looks as if he's been stuffed by a taxidermist. Yvette Mimeux looks as if she's smoked up all the Beautiful Downtown Burbank Brown. <br /><br />It's a sort of Roy Rogers version of Rosemary's Baby. This is one turkey that should never have been made. If you have insomnia and it's 1:30 on Saturday morning and there's nothing on but replays of the 1972 Roller Derby Chamionship, then I guess it beats that.

{"value":"It was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience, to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most. However, this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan ( who became annoying as hell in her own right ). Her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles. This film might have been more, as there was suitable budget for settings, actors and a decent story line. My wife and I both agreed that this was 'Muck' at the end, as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high! Better luck next time, hope Miss Graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like From Hell.","finished_norm":["it","be","obviou","that","thi","movi","be","design","to","appeal","to","the","chick","flick","audienc","to","which","i","have","sit","through","quit","a","few","and","enjoi","much","howev","thi","be","a","veri","irrit","attempt","by","heather","graham","to","becom","the","next","meg","ryan","who","becom","annoi","a","hell","in","her","own","right","her","act","be","overdo","and","it","appear","that","she","be","overanxi","compar","to","her","colleagu","who","be","relax","in","their","role","thi","film","mai","have","be","much","a","there","be","suitabl","budget","for","set","actor","and","a","decent","stori","line","my","wife","and","i","both","agre","that","thi","be","muck","at","the","end","a","the","film","end","on","a","pain","embarrass","high","well","luck","next","time","hope","miss","graham","stick","to","the","typ","of","film","that","she","belong","in","like","from","hell"],"filtered":["obviou","thi","movi","design","appeal","chick","flick","audienc","sit","quit","enjoi","much","howev","thi","veri","irrit","attempt","heather","graham","becom","next","meg","ryan","becom","annoi","hell","right","act","overdo","appear","overanxi","compar","colleagu","relax","role","thi","film","mai","much","suitabl","budget","set","actor","decent","stori","line","wife","agre","thi","muck","end","film","end","pain","embarrass","high","well","luck","next","time","hope","miss","graham","stick","typ","film","belong","like","hell"],"filtered2":["obviou","design","appeal","chick","flick","audienc","sit","quit","enjoi","howev","veri","irrit","attempt","heather","graham","becom","next","meg","ryan","becom","annoi","hell","right","act","overdo","appear","overanxi","compar","colleagu","relax","role","mai","suitabl","budget","set","actor","decent","stori","line","wife","agre","muck","end","end","pain","embarrass","high","well","luck","next","time","hope","miss","graham","stick","typ","belong","like","hell"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,8,15,17,20,21,24,41,46,107,109,113,115,120,121,128,168,169,177,181,200,211,244,255,256,257,263,271,297,309,383,384,394,416,459,482,557,622,681,689,959,1042,1540,1794,1977,2232,2767,3176,3399,3654,3974,4498],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,8,15,17,20,21,24,41,46,107,109,113,115,120,121,128,168,169,177,181,200,211,244,255,256,257,263,271,297,309,383,384,394,416,459,482,557,622,681,689,959,1042,1540,1794,1977,2232,2767,3176,3399,3654,3974,4498],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.9418936859054116,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,1.5687599167621034,1.655771293751733,2.1439533986393955,2.125691139326857,2.1521782565202803,4.40310717685161,2.2044500422972613,2.2190595059394194,2.3409902041158843,2.4894767118610357,2.4214486257841834,2.458149992634611,2.4442286541160034,2.5308211829319704,2.5687161421197025,2.634508058031767,2.6754694156628323,2.748952192422636,2.7602659523229094,2.902686292364678,2.757740698455715,5.626981427120414,2.848772527704847,3.0433232530252132,3.109204957709252,6.193476377888245,3.1401446412440817,3.2829611516442836,3.3154667220492153,3.43462735814388,3.4933926673701317,3.706716172503366,3.634471265630037,3.969732115064953,4.176068548062782,4.528289141652134,4.74221603786142,4.900964426937307,5.116075806554253,5.290429193699031,11.591955520728355,5.626901430320244,5.672363804397,6.137727054086234,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.058048681192563E-5,7.010454608898198E-5,7.06495420866938E-5,7.024132827986211E-5,7.024247910494308E-5,7.014429415628379E-5,7.035291311522972E-5,7.011464068554197E-5,7.027228395762115E-5,0.1468985947433446,0.6530772285452238,7.000146019690476E-5,0.037538572329473816,7.232522706595504E-5,7.005250453143212E-5,6.9858909633717E-5,0.157120685282738,7.035950465214255E-5,7.014121456304857E-5,7.019934915902574E-5,7.087856903488541E-5,7.0429213116955E-5,7.050940746065301E-5,7.058537343891922E-5,7.112707991704645E-5,7.075510531288574E-5,7.372951552529576E-5,7.002227098918045E-5,7.002414424891299E-5,7.020155002237998E-5,7.169366753374493E-5,7.035542791966627E-5,7.55205919423789E-5,7.055332735629363E-5,7.009848708216795E-5,7.042203780945061E-5,7.002824664636323E-5,7.006962818782487E-5,6.985855865690669E-5,6.987668319000287E-5,7.003396711154045E-5,7.077267706687645E-5,7.041305135378198E-5,7.013465783192502E-5,7.098686746526278E-5,7.016157589684998E-5,7.24926966551082E-5,7.14266704203859E-5,6.989405136579025E-5,7.004852149362323E-5,7.002422602727924E-5,7.199497097170747E-5,7.004956368208149E-5,6.987047973729445E-5,7.063740824477132E-5,7.006760659011938E-5,7.535001025852579E-5,7.000986177788186E-5,6.989324308118314E-5,7.022696280322934E-5,7.092355525271621E-5,7.022231689018233E-5,6.988031267495808E-5,7.0043018280

{"value":"I thought \"Intensive Care\" was quite bad and very unintentionally funny. But at least not as bad as I thought it might be. Sometimes it's somewhat suspenseful, but never a good shocker.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD<br /><br />The fun lies in ridiculous moments. But the all-time classic moment is this: Peter (Koen Wauters) is stabbed and beaten by the killer. He lies moaning in the corner of the hallway. Amy (Nada van Nie) kneels beside him and asks \"Poor Peter, shall I get you a band-aid?\".<br /><br />This movie was shot in Dutch and English.

{"value":"I found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that. The basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions (deliberate and otherwise) effect the lives of the others. The film's premise holds great promise but I feel it fails to deliver on its promise. Too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it. As a result, I never got a true feel for any of the characters and never made a good connection with them emotionally. By the end of the movie, I had a \"so what\" attitude about all of them. A stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great, but as it stands it is merely

{"value":"Underneath the dense green glop of computer graphics there gleamed the astounding art and skill of Ichikawa Somegoro. Alas: it got lost in all the goo. The scenes of Old Edo -- with the courtesan, drifting on the Sumida, rehearsing and acting in the Nakamura-za -- were all exciting and engaging, taking you back to an interesting and rich era. The action on the Kabuki stage, in which Somegoro excels and excites, was more enriching than any of the absurd high jinks that followed. The skill, the energy in the audience, the colors of the sets, were far more satisfying than all the nonsense that took over plot and performance. What a wasted opportunity! One of the best kabuki actors alive, and he gets lost in the

{"value":"I am terribly sorry, I know that FaÃŸbinder still is called one of the greatest directors in post-war Germany and that most of his films are considered \"master-pieces\", but when I see \"Lili Marleen\" today, in 2004, I wonder what everyone is up and away about this movie! The acting is simply terrible - Hanna Schygulla is all the smiling like an idiot! -, the changings between Nazi-glamour and battlefields are ridiculous, the whole film looks as if it was made within two days in an attic. Probably it was exactly that way and many people seem to take this for \"real art\", but for me this movie is simply bad & cheap. Compare this to Viscontis \"La Caduta degli Dei\" and tell me again that \"Lili Marleen\" is a good

{"value":"I really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but, wow, did it turn corny, or should I say, \"just plain stupid.\" This is just another example of outdated humor. It might have been funny in 1940, but not now....not even close.<br /><br />Dick Powell is always interesting to watch. I especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the Busby Berkeley musicals to where he's mature and sounds it, too.<br /><br />He was fine as \"Jimmy MacDonald,\" but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters, the worst being the boss (Raymond Walburn) of the Maxford House Coffee Company, who did nothing but shout all the time. He was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie.","finished_norm":["i","realli","enjoi","the","half","hour","of","thi","movi","but","wow","do","it","turn","corni","or","should","i","sai","just","plain","stupid","thi","be","just","anoth","exampl","of","outdat","humor","it","mai","have","be","funni","in","but","not","nownot","even","closebr","br","dick","powel","be","alwai","interest","to","watch","i","especi","like","him","onc","he","start","switch","from","hi","boyish","look","and","high","voic","of","the","busbi","berkelei","music","to","where","he","matur","and","sound","it","toobr","br","he","be","fine","a","jimmi","macdonald","but","the","rest","of","the","cast","just","plai","stupid","charact","the","wrong","be","the","boss","raymond","walburn","of","the","maxford","hous","coffe","compani","who","do","noth","but","shout","all","the","time","he","be","brutal","to","hear","and","be","a","big","detrim","to","the","movi"],"filtered":["realli","enjoi","half","hour","thi","movi","wow","turn","corni","sai","plain","stupid","thi","anoth","exampl","outdat","humor","mai","funni","nownot","even","closebr","br","dick","powel","alwai","interest","watch","especi","like","onc","start","switch","hi","boyish","look","high","voic","busbi","berkelei","music","matur","sound","toobr","br","fine","jimmi","macdonald","rest","cast","plai","stupid","charact","wrong","boss","raymond","walburn","maxford","hous","coffe","compani","noth","shout","time","brutal","hear","big","detrim","movi"],"filtered2":["realli","enjoi","half","hour","wow","turn","corni","plain","stupid","anoth","exampl","outdat","humor","mai","funni","nownot","even","closebr","dick","powel","alwai","interest","watch","especi","like","onc","start","switch","boyish","look","high","voic","busbi","berkelei","music","matur","sound","toobr","fine","jimmi","macdonald","rest","cast","plai","stupid","charact","wrong","boss","raymond","walburn","maxford","hous","coffe","compani","noth","shout","time","brutal","hear","big","detrim"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,8,10,13,16,25,40,46,49,60,62,71,73,82,92,96,118,136,174,178,197,200,206,211,213,216,226,236,267,307,369,428,464,586,882,1003,1191,1249,1486,1579,1865,1969,2466,2718,2933,2944,4118,5222,5652,5780,7578,7909,8502],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,8,10,13,16,25,40,46,49,60,62,71,73,82,92,96,118,136,174,178,197,200,206,211,213,216,226,236,267,307,369,428,464,586,882,1003,1191,1249,1486,1579,1865,1969,2466,2718,2933,2944,4118,5222,5652,5780,7578,7909,8502],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.2796387880827016,1.6284968758320737,1.655771293751733,1.6920303308087352,1.838176641236591,2.0226120445069267,1.9214926742550966,1.8950689206770979,2.020196584395323,2.0489535369135887,2.0390708128715254,2.354379525480895,4.693651971159972,2.456282578459816,2.532833256045391,2.558331832813986,2.5308211829319704,2.597304642813496,2.5687161421197025,2.8432628718938773,2.6070186965339692,2.5940874818617203,2.617923930016232,2.7085302779237206,2.8767855639325206,3.121829110937649,3.3721070011625462,3.2872346624216657,3.4572130107926293,3.9612932464190886,4.035401218572811,4.3215761317340196,4.499089986959872,4.566029469634981,4.605250182788262,5.00274712124725,4.85885294158718,5.3560264761848435,5.274680836730892,5.463272006538442,5.463272006538442,5.878215858601149,6.725513718988353,6.600350576034347,6.389041482367141,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.731598958112133E-5,6.686206212618214E-5,6.738185090295102E-5,6.699251785059087E-5,6.69936154475707E-5,6.68999717610574E-5,6.709894165062828E-5,6.687168982623852E-5,6.702204176259017E-5,0.07553482698703659,0.34311577018622186,6.676374417527991E-5,6.800985635236613E-5,6.898003189744837E-5,6.681242760105984E-5,6.66277868780187E-5,6.828973367716799E-5,6.71052283149769E-5,6.689703460554177E-5,6.695248035313954E-5,6.760028486897542E-5,6.717171261542576E-5,6.724819780061901E-5,6.732065019125092E-5,6.783730159569373E-5,6.748253160601022E-5,7.031936903675946E-5,6.678359242426886E-5,6.678537904176521E-5,6.695457942189516E-5,0.30259376339983335,0.1039828933996254,7.202760437031044E-5,6.729008630792312E-5,6.685628336128566E-5,6.716486918111374E-5,6.678929169463135E-5,6.682875925202162E-5,6.662745213463035E-5,6.664473836962496E-5,6.679474757615983E-5,6.749929062910555E-5,6.715629836808192E-5,6.689078113714086E-5,6.770357426722455E-5,6.691645418446427E-5,6.91397556628657E-5,6.812303540276056E-5,6.66613032304407E-5,6.680862878719844E-5,6.678545703770855E-5,6.866505084810097E-5,6.680962277222981E-5,6.663882183976311E-5,6.737027827695581E-5,6.682683115749821E-5,0.08517245282832675,6.677175716531532E-5,6.6660532

Darkman ranks up there with the best, like Indiana Jones, Aliens, Star Wars, Die hard, you get the point. There isn't too many good horror, thriller, sets out there. Many thanks to the whole crew, and set for giving us the Darkman trilogy. By the way if your wondering how I came across this one on DVD. I purchased it through the internet, it is however region 4, as you know most US DVD players are region 1. If you own a Sony Playstation 2, you have the best DVD player since it is an all region player. Just go to set up then choose witch region setting you want ( 1-9 ).","finished_norm":["i","wont","take","too","much","time","here","just","want","to","state","that","darkman","be","awesom","i","have","all","on","dvd","add","thi","to","my","collect","of","dvd","movi","set","darkman","rank","up","there","with","the","well","like","indiana","jone","alien","star","war","die","hard","you","get","the","point","there","be","not","too","mani","good","horror","thriller","set","out","there","mani","thank","to","the","whole","crow","and","set","for","give","u","the","darkman","trilogi","by","the","wai","if","your","wonder","how","i","come","across","thi","on","on","dvd","i","purchas","it","through","the","internet","it","be","howev","region","a","you","know","much","u","dvd","player","be","region","if","you","own","a","soni","playstat","you","have","the","well","dvd","player","sinc","it","be","a","all","region","player","just","go","to","set","up","then","choos","witch","region","set","you","want"],"filtered":["wont","take","much","time","want","state","darkman","awesom","dvd","add","thi","collect","dvd","movi","set","darkman","rank","well","like","indiana","jone","alien","star","war","die","hard","get","point","mani","good","horror","thriller","set","mani","thank","whole","crow","set","give","u","darkman","trilogi","wai","wonder","come","across","thi","dvd","purchas","internet","howev","region","know","much","u","dvd","player","region","soni","playstat","well","dvd","player","sinc","region","player","go","set","choos","witch","region","set","want"],"filtered2":["wont","take","time","want","state","darkman","awesom","dvd","add","collect","dvd","set","darkman","rank","well","like","indiana","jone","alien","star","war","die","hard","get","point","mani","good","horror","thriller","set","mani","thank","whole","crow","set","give","u","darkman","trilogi","wai","wonder","come","across","dvd","purchas","internet","howev","region","know","u","dvd","player","region","soni","playstat","well","dvd","player","sinc","region","player","go","set","choos","witch","region","set","want"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,8,20,26,30,31,33,34,37,50,66,83,100,109,111,112,113,162,171,175,247,293,299,314,498,503,565,584,651,714,769,999,1026,1135,1195,1654,1679,2363,2555,2650,3127,3871,4833,7940],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,8,20,26,30,31,33,34,37,50,66,83,100,109,111,112,113,162,171,175,247,293,299,314,498,503,565,584,651,714,769,999,1026,1135,1195,1654,1679,2363,2555,2650,3127,3871,4833,7940],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,2.330690080046114,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.4070669811451506,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,2.975308642954861,3.43598877114071,1.929723173391612,2.292318797740072,2.1405462403177813,10.628455696634285,2.1183455303375887,4.493325799357863,2.1521782565202803,2.3586007221245198,2.373087554090762,2.3791142619576227,13.651879034248502,2.9012296278682137,2.7949961309240425,3.189397019426827,3.386191741044285,3.3490645070153917,3.9081109809587793,3.5146700658174166,3.5474598886404074,3.7297814454343623,3.857614816944247,12.390777036094462,4.062925891962901,4.4919214974812585,4.422928625994308,4.637773374493822,4.706176101378222,5.156897801074508,5.339219357868463,5.290429193699031,5.482320201509136,23.512863434404597,6.137727054086234,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.370665557244101E-5,6.327706670051577E-5,6.37689855563194E-5,6.340052767842125E-5,6.340156642468623E-5,6.331294370487838E-5,6.350124527042104E-5,6.32861781846559E-5,6.342846858376327E-5,7.037042347001157E-5,0.780697018257377,6.318402034000481E-5,6.436331874688019E-5,6.528147563174448E-5,6.323009346850738E-5,6.305535277137698E-5,6.46281896704845E-5,6.350719485777538E-5,6.331016403312488E-5,6.336263690275285E-5,6.397570757772071E-5,6.357011441754158E-5,6.364249863680094E-5,6.371106629099587E-5,6.420001599341673E-5,0.02707288073247577,6.654900048520663E-5,6.320280436991991E-5,6.320449519295003E-5,6.336462342409895E-5,6.471142366115928E-5,6.350351515813801E-5,0.04449981968803483,6.36821411752806E-5,6.327159778017181E-5,6.356363791299398E-5,6.320819805805041E-5,6.324554945257931E-5,6.305503597618641E-5,6.307139536161325E-5,6.321336140731619E-5,6.388012842491875E-5,6.355552664794103E-5,6.330424586182518E-5,6.407345882760188E-5,6.33285423773114E-5,6.543263536323611E-5,6.44704293877006E-5,6.308707205134417E-5,6.322649833861688E-5,0.036459250257792335,0.10648945718824096,6.32274390283762E-5,6.30657960629557E-5,6.375803342885412E-5,6.324372473820642E-5,6.801167529080739E-5,6.31916036912928E-5,6.30863424855478E-5,6.338756125507513E-5,6.401631258930827E-5,6.338336780734369E-5,6.307467137115062E-5,6.322153108309148E-5,6.305579863800832E-5,6.451477912328486E-5,6.359899474358402E-5,6

{"value":"Gritty, dusty western from director Richard Brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichÃ©s intact. Early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave gambler (James Coburn), a cocky kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, though one which breaks no new ground (it instead resembles something from Gary Cooper's era).

{"value":"I was so eager to see this one of my favorite TV shows.I saw Universal trademark followed with a newly acquainted title and theme song which still impress me.Computer animation on some scenery like a solid title name\"The Jetsons\" or a dimension view of a spaceship approaching an amusement park and more made this version splendid and fantastic.Shortly after that till the end...I couldn't believe my eyes!!!!How lucky I was that I could forget all I had seen.Just songs by Tiffany and its theme song in new arrangement were in my head.Anyway,I wish to see this space-aged family

{"value":"In the future of 1985, a governmental committee headed by Howard Hesseman, is holding hearings on TV's first uncensored network. They sample it's programming, that play as a series of skits. I can name the good 'skit' movies on one hand, not using my thumb. \"Amazon Women on the Moon\", \"Kentucky Fried Movie\", \"The Meaning of Life\", and \"Mr. Mike's Mondo Video\". Notice how I didn't mention \"Tunnel Vision\"? The reason for that is that this 'movie' is death in cinematic form. None of the skits are even remotely funny, or even the least bit clever. It takes some sort of great ineptitude on the film makers' part to not even get one laugh out of me.<br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />Eye Candy: Dody Dorn goes full

If you are an anti-Semite (or merely an anti-Zionist---nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country, right?) or uncritically in support of Palestinian goals (e.g., mass murder, the destruction of Israel), this is the documentary for you. Should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the UK and US. However, any informed and intellectually honest person would be outraged at the sheer number of lies presented in this video. I just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation aren't corrupted by this anti-Semitic filth.","finished_norm":["a","propaganda","film","for","the","palestinian","caus","if","you","be","expect","a","unbias","documentari","on","the","israelipalestinian","conflict","you","will","ne","to","look","elsewher","if","you","be","a","antisemit","or","mere","a","antizionistnoth","wrong","with","advoc","the","destruct","of","a","countri","right","or","uncrit","in","support","of","palestinian","goal","eg","mass","murder","the","destruct","of","israel","thi","be","the","documentari","for","you","should","make","for","a","entertain","even","on","colleg","campu","around","the","uk","and","u","howev","ani","inform","and","intellectu","honest","person","would","be","outrag","at","the","sheer","numb","of","lie","present","in","thi","video","i","just","hope","that","who","truli","be","unawar","of","the","situat","be","not","corrupt","by","thi","antisemit","filth"],"filtered":["propaganda","film","palestinian","caus","expect","unbias","documentari","israelipalestinian","conflict","ne","look","elsewher","antisemit","mere","antizionistnoth","wrong","advoc","destruct","countri","right","uncrit","support","palestinian","goal","eg","mass","murder","destruct","israel","thi","documentari","make","entertain","even","colleg","campu","around","uk","u","howev","ani","inform","intellectu","honest","person","outrag","sheer","numb","lie","present","thi","video","hope","truli","unawar","situat","corrupt","thi","antisemit","filth"],"filtered2":["propaganda","palestinian","caus","expect","unbias","documentari","israelipalestinian","conflict","ne","look","elsewher","antisemit","mere","antizionistnoth","wrong","advoc","destruct","countri","right","uncrit","support","palestinian","goal","eg","mass","murder","destruct","israel","documentari","make","entertain","even","colleg","campu","around","uk","u","howev","ani","inform","intellectu","honest","person","outrag","sheer","numb","lie","present","video","hope","truli","unawar","situat","corrupt","antisemit","filth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,16,25,27,98,110,112,113,121,130,153,181,195,240,273,343,411,453,458,473,516,608,624,650,814,836,1044,1103,1331,1626,1656,1702,1738,1780,1829,1838,2236,2240,2352,2583,2961,4008,4683,4991,5717,7561,8399],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,16,25,27,98,110,112,113,121,130,153,181,195,240,273,343,411,453,458,473,516,608,624,650,814,836,1044,1103,1331,1626,1656,1702,1738,1780,1829,1838,2236,2240,2352,2583,2961,4008,4683,4991,5717,7561,8399],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.926017105726131,1.1966138720291084,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,2.0881990796736947,2.1290479736304078,2.2466628996789315,2.1521782565202803,2.2190595059394194,2.2642139034199635,2.3409902041158843,2.4442286541160034,2.51289241584188,2.7666071276613566,2.9674191958529437,2.9705344631698933,3.229006157521873,3.2872346624216657,3.2850956241729166,3.335489637924323,3.442099372982581,3.616452760127359,7.8483511669251715,3.6621227969605474,3.9363956947973615,3.8463152616903136,4.125296222689358,4.160564361526816,4.513582994262438,4.613282354485526,4.798834931860927,4.869215728622727,4.751432692966343,4.869215728622727,4.8796870284900224,4.911775343041523,5.051537285416681,5.089758498236879,5.0768550934009715,10.549361673461783,5.695894301807195,5.850044981634453,6.342521466732247,6.437831646536572,14.071337294584385,6.794506590475304,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.198600437892836E-5,6.156801826025639E-5,6.204665089409869E-5,6.168814468422749E-5,6.168915537502503E-5,6.16029262636595E-5,6.178614199773636E-5,6.157688365258839E-5,0.06904444380025318,6.846979076462678E-5,0.4320150016206284,6.147748498616987E-5,6.26249317569318E-5,0.359646887131771,6.152231372689482E-5,6.135229259613266E-5,6.288264878952219E-5,6.17919308928602E-5,6.160022166797894E-5,6.165127729940877E-5,6.22477895664817E-5,6.185315106008045E-5,6.192358025608297E-5,6.199029596851502E-5,6.246603964275126E-5,6.213935984095567E-5,6.475158048123645E-5,6.149576167877143E-5,6.149740683441187E-5,6.165321016685805E-5,6.296363471578191E-5,6.178835057812251E-5,6.632456014809745E-5,6.19621520904025E-5,6.156269704982174E-5,6.18468494792544E-5,6.150100968893727E-5,6.153735226074587E-5,6.135198435725412E-5,6.136790189251935E-5,6.150603358145403E-5,6.215479190821693E-5,6.183895729112156E-5,6.159446334039445E-5,6.234290065571931E-5,6.161810363200587E-5,0.07086321793925648,6.272914944959304E-5,6.138315517099672E-5,6.151881569776219E-5,6.149747865474632E-5,0.0637769586104053,6.151973098045937E-5,6.136245382515516E-5,6.203599457232318E-5,6.153557683003002E-5,6.617474994587457E-5,6.148486351894513E-5,6.138244531002155E-5,6.167552847062956E-5,6.228729787850117E-5,6.1671448283605E-5,6.137108942041112E-5,6.151398260269572E-5,6.135272642036522E-5,6.277230134446852E-5,6.188125135

{"value":"A truly frightening film. Feels as if it were made in the early '90s by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good, normal, mainstream-aspiring people. Retrograde to the point of being offensive, LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad, lonely, sex-crazed gays. Wow! Who knew? The supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (the effeminate buffoon, the bitter, lonely queen, the fag hag, etc.) and the main characters are milquetoast, middle-class, middlebrow clones, of little interest.<br /><br />As far as the romantic & ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned, there's not much to say: we've seen it all before, and done much better.","finished_norm":["a","truli","frighten","film","feel","a","if","it","be","make","in","the","earli","by","a","straight","person","who","want","to","show","that","gai","be","good","normal","mainstreamaspir","peopl","retrograd","to","the","point","of","be","offens","ltr","suggest","that","monogami","and","marriag","be","the","prefer","path","to","salvat","for","sad","lone","sexcraz","gai","wow","who","know","the","support","charact","be","caricatur","of","gai","stereotyp","the","effemin","buffoon","the","bitter","lone","queen","the","fag","hag","etc","and","the","main","charact","be","milquetoast","middleclass","middlebrow","clone","of","littl","interestbr","br","a","far","a","the","romant","ideolog","struggl","of","the","main","coupl","be","concern","there","not","much","to","sai","we","have","see","it","all","befor","and","do","much","well"],"filtered":["truli","frighten","film","feel","make","earli","straight","person","want","show","gai","good","normal","mainstreamaspir","peopl","retrograd","point","offens","ltr","suggest","monogami","marriag","prefer","path","salvat","sad","lone","sexcraz","gai","wow","know","support","charact","caricatur","gai","stereotyp","effemin","buffoon","bitter","lone","queen","fag","hag","etc","main","charact","milquetoast","middleclass","middlebrow","clone","littl","interestbr","br","far","romant","ideolog","struggl","main","coupl","concern","much","sai","see","befor","much","well"],"filtered2":["truli","frighten","feel","make","earli","straight","person","want","show","gai","good","normal","mainstreamaspir","peopl","retrograd","point","offens","ltr","suggest","monogami","marriag","prefer","path","salvat","sad","lone","sexcraz","gai","wow","know","support","charact","caricatur","gai","stereotyp","effemin","buffoon","bitter","lone","queen","fag","hag","etc","main","charact","milquetoast","middleclass","middlebrow","clone","littl","interestbr","far","romant","ideolog","struggl","main","coupl","concern","see","befor","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,10,14,20,23,26,28,37,43,66,79,101,153,179,253,266,343,429,455,458,548,604,640,646,700,842,864,874,1003,1145,1268,1469,1478,1691,1708,2097,2133,2812,2886,5564,5666,5714,7412,7743,7866,8267],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,10,14,20,23,26,28,37,43,66,79,101,153,179,253,266,343,429,455,458,548,604,640,646,700,842,864,874,1003,1145,1268,1469,1478,1691,1708,2097,2133,2812,2886,5564,5666,5714,7412,7743,7866,8267],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,2.247774048205673,1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.4876543214774305,1.6608112036218214,1.929723173391612,1.9469506069506084,2.098582041218749,2.3409902041158843,5.01593744596019,2.7073305177318163,2.747702973022204,2.9705344631698933,3.2872346624216657,3.2787058260741455,3.2850956241729166,3.459754308221302,3.5727776966246974,11.99952574960897,3.5900195030592035,3.616452760127359,3.8883864756110005,3.9782428047328615,3.872882289075035,4.035401218572811,4.2574141875167335,4.30366520516749,4.654440426979034,4.597282013139085,9.521470171257315,4.688631791727313,5.00274712124725,5.014723312293965,5.408212229355414,5.390512652256013,6.2980697041614135,6.489124940924123,6.389041482367141,6.725513718988353,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.568518109876537E-5,6.524225056667462E-5,6.574944685313826E-5,6.53695458487685E-5,6.537061685517934E-5,6.527924179636113E-5,6.547339140793172E-5,6.525164502445059E-5,6.539835450951145E-5,7.255590437279346E-5,0.6008134966816465,6.514631448298249E-5,6.636223813694063E-5,0.04278349815272321,6.519381849590366E-5,6.501365091006511E-5,6.663533510661223E-5,6.547952577049276E-5,6.527637579686887E-5,6.533047830646248E-5,6.596258900117344E-5,6.554439941110003E-5,6.561903165333628E-5,6.568972880017033E-5,6.619386372081738E-5,0.051365059391384194,6.861580017871171E-5,6.516568188495409E-5,6.516742521955456E-5,6.533252652282548E-5,6.672115407955815E-5,6.547573179112125E-5,7.028265151584296E-5,0.14891025955336415,6.523661179910818E-5,6.553772176697834E-5,6.517124308383448E-5,6.520975449354318E-5,6.501332427622636E-5,6.503019173198542E-5,6.517656679025968E-5,6.586404146474022E-5,6.552935859190414E-5,6.527027382604493E-5,6.606337609309312E-5,6.529532491380711E-5,0.13480416349235982,6.647267529262986E-5,6.504635528969777E-5,6.519011171274563E-5,6.516750132595505E-5,0.01645843184581914,6.519108161732849E-5,6.502441853697083E-5,6.573815458752628E-5,6.520787310936191E-5,7.012390099849557E-5,6.515413334897397E-5,6.504560306591475E-5,6.535617672967036E-5,6.600445507490907E-5,6.53518530468276E-5,6.503356948393002E-5,6.518499019010694E-5,6.501411062389191E-5,6.651840238954553E-5,6.5574176

{"value":"How can a major German TV station broadcast a mess like this? It's amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent - Even the well-known Gottfried John is acting very poor - especially in the double murder scene - how amateurish.......! The screen plan is very , very extended - perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie. Be careful not to fall asleep while watching! The set is obviously very often a blue screen, f.g. the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background...! In the German version the sound and the dubbing is very poor - probably reason: different languages of actors - but: other international productions do handle this much more professional.

{"value":"I can't believe that those praising this movie herein aren't thinking of some other film. I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful, but the script (or lack thereof) makes for a film that's also pointless.

Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie he's been in. Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina. Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target. Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter B's amazingly awful book, Killing of the Unicorn.","finished_norm":["i","ca","not","believ","that","that","prais","thi","movi","herein","be","not","think","of","some","other","film","i","be","prepar","for","the","possibl","that","thi","would","be","aw","but","the","script","or","lack","thereof","make","for","a","film","that","conjur","pointless","on","the","plu","side","the","gener","level","of","craft","on","the","part","of","the","actor","and","technic","crow","be","quit","compet","but","when","you","have","get","a","sow","ear","to","work","with","you","ca","not","make","a","silk","purs","ben","g","fan","should","stick","with","just","about","ani","other","movi","he","be","in","dorothi","fan","should","stick","to","galaxina","peter","b","fan","should","stick","to","last","pictur","show","and","target","fan","of","cheap","laugh","at","the","expens","of","that","who","seem","to","be","ask","for","it","should","stick","to","peter","b","amazingli","aw","book","kill","of","the","unicorn"],"filtered":["ca","believ","prais","thi","movi","herein","think","film","prepar","possibl","thi","aw","script","lack","thereof","make","film","conjur","pointless","plu","side","gener","level","craft","part","actor","technic","crow","quit","compet","get","sow","ear","work","ca","make","silk","purs","ben","g","fan","stick","ani","movi","dorothi","fan","stick","galaxina","peter","b","fan","stick","last","pictur","show","target","fan","cheap","laugh","expens","seem","ask","stick","peter","b","amazingli","aw","book","kill","unicorn"],"filtered2":["ca","believ","prais","herein","think","prepar","possibl","aw","script","lack","thereof","make","conjur","pointless","plu","side","gener","level","craft","part","actor","technic","crow","quit","compet","get","sow","ear","work","ca","make","silk","purs","ben","g","fan","stick","ani","dorothi","fan","stick","galaxina","peter","b","fan","stick","last","pictur","show","target","fan","cheap","laugh","expens","seem","ask","stick","peter","b","amazingli","aw","book","kill","unicorn"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,12,27,28,35,39,41,48,61,76,77,81,91,120,133,138,140,144,151,183,225,306,311,351,402,416,425,445,534,642,749,760,769,854,944,1271,1295,1360,1645,1743,1789,2223,2235,2970,3162,5599,6570,6969,7657],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,12,27,28,35,39,41,48,61,76,77,81,91,120,133,138,140,144,151,183,225,306,311,351,402,416,425,445,534,642,749,760,769,854,944,1271,1295,1360,1645,1743,1789,2223,2235,2970,3162,5599,6570,6969,7657],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.7966340470719924,1.066728610262888,1.3002700588679295,1.5452294193519092,1.463169012899134,1.5538940054862738,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.8818517047392527,2.1337665533324026,1.9463902258768238,3.899514464849456,2.0105926690411424,2.2044500422972613,2.3212364753796515,4.581473037857885,9.268679103988392,2.2931108769894046,2.8002454868101863,2.4885128563647294,2.641219492619754,2.8739486825973213,2.9203338091782562,3.0135689919434205,3.084424928710765,12.560578564976327,3.226987993365636,3.241201430615691,3.4272107604888307,7.244845854227726,3.7165362186843414,7.700135222617728,3.857614816944247,4.291900363587903,3.969732115064953,4.3773181147422555,4.358390104856736,4.396611317676934,4.662879295624898,4.724033718778229,4.798834931860927,5.051537285416681,5.039114765418124,5.672363804397,5.541743621979936,6.2980697041614135,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.37314179252428E-5,6.330166207498365E-5,6.379377213637088E-5,6.342517104134912E-5,6.342621019136785E-5,6.333755302449895E-5,6.352592778160625E-5,6.3310777100697E-5,6.345312280713499E-5,0.384148943476238,0.49278335634287884,6.320857954797195E-5,6.43883363402852E-5,6.530685010661668E-5,6.325467058479277E-5,6.307986196711698E-5,6.465331021745374E-5,6.353187968152558E-5,6.333477227230555E-5,6.338726553778853E-5,6.400057450924535E-5,6.359482369770568E-5,6.366723605222906E-5,6.373583035821459E-5,6.42249701121289E-5,6.388909159915529E-5,6.6574867638549E-5,6.322737087911439E-5,6.322906235935616E-5,6.338925283128225E-5,6.473657656062646E-5,6.352819855161346E-5,6.819213956212383E-5,6.370689399949946E-5,6.329619102890676E-5,6.35883446757839E-5,6.323276666373556E-5,6.327013257650278E-5,6.307954504879024E-5,6.309591079300124E-5,6.32379320199608E-5,6.390495820546314E-5,6.358023025793622E-5,6.332885180065208E-5,6.409836375438643E-5,6.335315776003208E-5,6.545806859288938E-5,6.449548861429846E-5,6.311159357615708E-5,6.325107405749922E-5,6.322913620202107E-5,6.500864177573714E-5,6.32520151128984E-5,6.30903093179336E-5,6.378281575188657E-5,6.326830715287558E-5,6.80381109761068E-5,6.321616584685808E-5,6.311086372678334E-5,6.341219957804059E-5,0.06989350516775426,6.340800450034393E-5,6.309918807590171E-5,6.324610487123469E-5,6.30803080

{"value":"Of all movies (and I'm a film graduate, if that's worth anything to you), this is THE WORST movie I have ever seen. I know there are probably some worse ones out there that I just haven't seen yet, but I have seen this, and this is the worst. A friend and I rented it one night because Denise Richards was on the cover. Talk about being young and retarded. She's uncredited! Her role was unbelievably small! How did she make it on the cover!? IMDb doesn't even list it in her filmography. This movie was so bad, we wrote a little note to the video store when we returned it, and slipped it inside the case. It read something like \"please save your further customers from having to view this complete and totally bad

{"value":"Just saw the movie this past weekend, I am upset, and disappointed with it. Basically, the movie tells you that immigrants, the ones from former Soviet Union especially, come to this country, bring everyone they can with them from the old country, and invade and take over what Americans have been working for. Which is a very wrong way of looking at immigration, and a much worse way of telling people about it. That's the main thing. Another thing, the overall writing, directing and filming is on the level of village amateurs. The actors did pretty well, but it wasn't up to them save this bunch of crap. A few jokes were funny, but most were bad and cheesy. Couldn't wait to get out of the theater, want my money
