{"value":"Jeremy Northam struggles against a \"Total Recall\" clone script and disposable romantic by-play to bring life to a confused character. Lucy Liu graduates her acting from a wooden start to a workman-like finish. You can't fail to laugh when viewing her interviews on the DVD when she uses the term \"Femme fatal\" and \"Romance\". French film-noir actress she is not and they lack chemistry together.<br /><br />This movie fails, not in the plot or the action sequences but in the lack of attention to detail in the films photography and ham-fisted portrayal of the world of technology surrounding the main protagonists. Little attempt is made to dress the scenery to represent any contiguous filmic landscape or period. Automobiles are very 1990's and the architecture barely modern with open plans that hint at a restricted budget rather than conscious set dressing techniques.<br /><br />The technology is positively hilarious. Massive \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" mainframes fed by man-portable CD-ROM's with data collected for some unexplained reason, in spite of the proliferating communications network that even the most un-savvy technologist today would obviously be aware. There is an obvious lack of research done here and given the open-source nature of the cyber-community, research would have cost little more than a bulletin board and personal time.<br /><br />DVD interviews also reveal the original movie name was \"Company Man\" but this likely ditched in order to cash in on Matrix hype. The \"Cypher\" title has only the slightest link with the movie. Terry Gilliam would have done wonders with this concept; and completely re-written the Decalogue.<br /><br />This is Tele-movie quality and extremely disappointing for a movie length production. It might have made a good sub-plot for \"Alias\".","finished_norm":["jeremi","northam","struggl","against","a","total","recal","clone","script","and","dispos","romant","byplai","to","bring","life","to","a","confus","charact","luci","liu","graduat","her","act","from","a","wooden","start","to","a","workmanlik","finish","you","ca","not","fail","to","laugh","when","view","her","interview","on","the","dvd","when","she","us","the","term","femm","fatal","and","romanc","french","filmnoir","actress","she","be","not","and","thei","lack","chemistri","togetherbr","br","thi","movi","fail","not","in","the","plot","or","the","action","sequenc","but","in","the","lack","of","attent","to","detail","in","the","film","photographi","and","hamfist","portray","of","the","world","of","technologi","surround","the","main","protagonist","littl","attempt","be","make","to","dress","the","sceneri","to","repres","ani","contigu","filmic","landscap","or","period","automobil","be","veri","and","the","architectur","bare","modern","with","open","plan","that","hint","at","a","restrict","budget","rather","than","consciou","set","dress","techniquesbr","br","the","technologi","be","posit","hilari","massiv","a","space","odyssei","mainfram","fe","by","manport","cdrom","with","datum","collect","for","some","unexplain","reason","in","spite","of","the","prolifer","commun","network","that","even","the","much","unsavvi","technologist","todai","would","obvious","be","awar","there","be","a","obviou","lack","of","research","do","here","and","give","the","opensourc","natur","of","the","cybercommun","research","would","have","cost","littl","much","than","a","bulletin","board","and","person","timebr","br","dvd","interview","conjur","reveal","the","origin","movi","name","be","compani","man","but","thi","like","ditch","in","order","to","cash","in","on","matrix","hyp","the","cypher","titl","have","onli","the","slight","link","with","the","movi","terri","gilliam","would","have","do","wonder","with","thi","concept","and","complet","rewrit","the","decaloguebr","br","thi","be","telemovi","qualiti","and","extrem","disappoint","for","a","movi","length","product","it","mai","have","make","a","good","subplot","for","alia"],"filtered":["jeremi","northam","struggl","total","recal","clone","script","dispos","romant","byplai","bring","life","confus","charact","luci","liu","graduat","act","wooden","start","workmanlik","finish","ca","fail","laugh","view","interview","dvd","us","term","femm","fatal","romanc","french","filmnoir","actress","thei","lack","chemistri","togetherbr","br","thi","movi","fail","plot","action","sequenc","lack","attent","detail","film","photographi","hamfist","portray","world","technologi","surround","main","protagonist","littl","attempt","make","dress","sceneri","repres","ani","contigu","filmic","landscap","period","automobil","veri","architectur","bare","modern","open","plan","hint","restrict","budget","rather","consciou","set","dress","techniquesbr","br","technologi","posit","hilari","massiv","space","odyssei","mainfram","fe","manport","cdrom","datum","collect","unexplain","reason","spite","prolifer","commun","network","even","much","unsavvi","technologist","todai","obvious","awar","obviou","lack","research","give","opensourc","natur","cybercommun","research","cost","littl","much","bulletin","board","person","timebr","br","dvd","interview","conjur","reveal","origin","movi","name","compani","man","thi","like","ditch","order","cash","matrix","hyp","cypher","titl","onli","slight","link","movi","terri","gilliam","wonder","thi","concept","complet","rewrit","decaloguebr","br","thi","telemovi","qualiti","extrem","disappoint","movi","length","product","mai","make","good","subplot","alia"],"filtered2":["jeremi","northam","struggl","total","recal","clone","script","dispos","romant","byplai","bring","life","confus","charact","luci","liu","graduat","act","wooden","start","workmanlik","finish","ca","fail","laugh","view","interview","dvd","us","term","femm","fatal","romanc","french","filmnoir","actress","lack","chemistri","togetherbr","fail","plot","action","sequenc","lack","attent","detail","photographi","hamfist","portray","world","technologi","surround","main","protagonist","littl","attempt","make","dress","sceneri","repres","ani","contigu","filmic","landscap","period","automobil","veri","architectur","bare","modern","open","plan","hint","restrict","budget","rather","consciou","set","dress","techniquesbr","technologi","posit","hilari","massiv","space","odyssei","mainfram","fe","manport","cdrom","datum","collect","unexplain","reason","spite","prolifer","commun","network","even","unsavvi","technologist","todai","obvious","awar","obviou","lack","research","give","opensourc","natur","cybercommun","research","cost","littl","bulletin","board","person","timebr","dvd","interview","conjur","reveal","origin","name","compani","man","like","ditch","order","cash","matrix","hyp","cypher","titl","onli","slight","link","terri","gilliam","wonder","concept","complet","rewrit","decaloguebr","telemovi","qualiti","extrem"

{"value":"Paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt. It does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood, and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.<br /><br />Unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife, a conflict over a road construction project, the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the intricacies of local church politics, and on and on and on. And all of that doesn't even include the actual central plot, which is only about the hopes, dreams, and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. I was actually shocked when I realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer (and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours!) <br /><br />Ultimately the movie is melodramatic, every plot point is predictable, major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later...and some of those events are extremely distasteful. Most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable \"twist\") and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on. Similarly, a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another \"twist.\" It's all totally mechanical, right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose

{"value":"Myron Breckinridge (Rex Reed!!!) gets a sex change from a doctor (John Carradine--dead drunk) and comes out as Myra (Raquel Welch). She then decides to destroy male masculinity (or something like that) and proceeds to teach film history at an acting college run by lecherous John Huston (don't ask) and break up a young happy couple (young, handsome, hunky Roger Herren and Farrah Fawcett--yes THE Farrah Fawcett). <br /><br />They took a great novel by Gore Vidal that was unfilmable and, naturally, tried to film it. They also hired an English guy with a decidedly Anti-American attitude and hired a bunch of actors with questionable \"talent\" (Welch, Reed) and embarassed old professionals (Huston, Carradine, Andy Devine, Jim Backus, Mae West), threw it all together and....SURPRISE!!! An absolute disaster. <br /><br />The film got an X rating at its release (it's been lowered to an R), mostly because of a truly tasteless scene in which Welch sodomizes Rusty (Roger Herren) and a scene in which Welch attempts to have sex with Fawcett.<br /><br />The movie is very scattershot...scenes jump all over the place and people say and do things that make no sense. It's not good at all but I was never bored. <br /><br />Acting varies wildly...Reed is horrible...really sad. Huston chews the scenery again and again and AGAIN to a nauseating extreme. Welch is actually not bad as Myra but her lines make no sense so you never know what to make of her. West is hardly in the movie (a blessing) and it's really kind of sick to hear a woman almost 80 years old cracking sex jokes. Roger Herren (whatever happened to...) was very young, handsome and not bad as Rusty. Fawcett is OK.<br /><br />It's hard to find things to say about this...you just watch it in disbelief.

{"value":"Note to Horror fans: The only horror here is when you realized you just wasted 95 minutes of your life on a movie that's so worthless it's insulting.<br /><br />I watched this because:<br /><br />The premise sounded slightly promising: It's not. It's just an excuse to use the same lame set pieces from other low-budget slasher films that weren't good either. <br /><br />The promise of naked forest nymphs sounded nice even if the movie turned out to be awful: It's not. It's SO not. The amateur cinematography makes sure the \"fallen angels\" are about as sexy as the average homeless person.<br /><br />The name Tom Savini has a long history in the horror genre: He's the king of low-budget special effects and lower-budget acting. Come to think of it, Savini should have been a reason not to watch this movie. It's not that he's bad, but he's almost always in bad movies. His only good role was in From Dusk Till Dawn, and he's been milking that at horror conventions ever since.<br /><br />But let's focus on the positive: Forest of the Damned is a great example of how NOT to make a movie. <br /><br />Everything else is a negative. Obviously the writer is allergic to originality. The script is terrible. That's all a given after the first 10 minutes. But the clueless pacing; the way the director treats \"plot\" and \"characterization\" as a nuisance he thinks no one cares about anyway; and the excruciatingly long and boring driving, walking, and nature sequences (no doubt added to increase the running time to make the film qualify for distribution) show a complete lack of aptitude for film and storytelling in general.<br /><br />This is another good example of the number-one way you can tell if a movie is going to be bad: If it's written and directed by the same person, expect garbage.","finished_norm":["note","to","horror","fan","the","onli","horror","here","be","when","you","realiz","you","just","wast","minut","of","your","life","on","a","movi","that","so","worthless","it","insultingbr","br","i","watch","thi","becausebr","br","the","premis","sound","slightli","promis","it","not","it","just","a","excus","to","us","the","same","lame","set","piec","from","other","lowbudget","slasher","film","that","be","not","good","either","br","br","the","promis","of","nake","forest","nymph","sound","nice","even","if","the","movi","turn","out","to","be","aw","it","not","it","so","not","the","amateur","cinematographi","make","sure","the","fall","angel","be","about","a","sexi","a","the","averag","homeless","personbr","br","the","name","tom","savini","have","a","long","histori","in","the","horror","genr","he","the","king","of","lowbudget","special","effect","and","lowerbudget","act","come","to","think","of","it","savini","should","have","be","a","reason","not","to","watch","thi","movi","it","not","that","he","bad","but","he","almost","alwai","in","bad","movi","hi","onli","good","role","be","in","from","dusk","till","dawn","and","he","be","milk","that","at","horror","convent","ever","sincebr","br","but","let","focu","on","the","posit","forest","of","the","damn","be","a","great","exampl","of","how","not","to","make","a","movi","br","br","everyth","els","be","a","neg","obvious","the","writer","be","allerg","to","origin","the","script","be","terribl","that","all","a","give","after","the","minut","but","the","clueless","pace","the","wai","the","director","treat","plot","and","character","a","a","nuisanc","he","think","no","on","care","about","anywai","and","the","excruciatingli","long","and","bore","drive","walk","and","natur","sequenc","no","doubt","add","to","increas","the","run","time","to","make","the","film","qualifi","for","distribut","show","a","complet","lack","of","aptitud","for","film","and","storytel","in","generalbr","br","thi","be","anoth","good","exampl","of","the","numberon","wai","you","can","tell","if","a","movi","be","go","to","be","bad","if","it","write","and","direct","by","the","same","person","expect","garbag"],"filtered":["note","horror","fan","onli","horror","realiz","wast","minut","life","movi","worthless","insultingbr","br","watch","thi","becausebr","br","premis","sound","slightli","promis","excus","us","lame","set","piec","lowbudget","slasher","film","good","either","br","br","promis","nake","forest","nymph","sound","nice","even","movi","turn","aw","amateur","cinematographi","make","sure","fall","angel","sexi","averag","homeless","personbr","br","name","tom","savini","long","histori","horror","genr","king","lowbudget","special","effect","lowerbudget","act","come","think","savini","reason","watch","thi","movi","bad","almost","alwai","bad","movi","hi","onli","good","role","dusk","till","dawn","milk","horror","convent","ever","sincebr","br","let","focu","posit","forest","damn","great","exampl","make","movi","br","br","everyth","els","neg","obvious","writer","allerg","origin","script","terribl","give","minut","clueless","pace","wai","director","treat","plot","character","nuisanc","think","care","anywai","excruciatingli","long","bore","drive","walk","natur","sequenc","doubt","add","increas","run","time","make","film","qualifi","distribut","show","complet","lack","aptitud","film","storytel","generalbr","br","thi","anoth","good","exampl","numberon","wai","tell","movi","go","bad","write","direct","person","expect","garbag"],"filtered2":["note","horror","fan","onli","horror","realiz","wast","minut","life","worthless","insultingbr","watch","becausebr","premis","sound","slightli","promis","excus","us","lame","set","piec","lowbudget","slasher","good","either","promis","nake","forest","nymph","sound","nice","even","turn","aw","amateur","cinematographi","make","sure","fall","angel","sexi","averag","homeless","personbr","name","tom","savini","long","histori","horror","genr","king","lowbudget","special","effect","lowerbudget","act","come","think","savini","reason","watch","bad","almost","alwai","bad","onli","good","role","dusk","till","dawn","milk","horror","convent","ever","sincebr","let","focu","posit","forest","damn","great","exampl","make","everyth","els","neg","obvious","writer","allerg","origin","script","terribl","give","minut","clueless","pace","wai","director","treat","plot","character","nuisanc","think","care","anywai","excruciatingli","long","bore","drive","walk","natur","sequenc","doubt","add","increas","run","time","make","qualifi","distribut","show","complet","lack","aptitud","storytel","generalbr","anoth","good","exampl","numberon","wai","tell","go","bad","write","direct","person","expect","garbag"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,21,28,30,32,33,34,44,51,56,58,59,65,69,73,75,77,83,89,90,95,96,99,102,103,106,108,109,119,124,128,130,131,137,138,140,143,153,166,169,178,183,193,196,197,203,205,207,218,262,287,294,299,307,341,349,373,386,405,456,461,4

{"value":"I was really, really disappointed with this movie. it started really well, and built up some great atmosphere and suspense, but when it finally got round to revealing the \"monster\"...it turned out to be just some psycho with skin problems......again. Whoop-de-do. Yet another nutjob movie...like we don't already have enough of them.<br /><br />To be fair, the \"creep\" is genuinely unsettling to look at, and the way he moves and the strange sounds he makes are pretty creepy, but I'm sick of renting film like this only to discover that the monster is human, albeit a twisted, demented, freakish one. When I saw all the tell-tale rats early on I was hoping for some kind of freaky rat-monster hybrid thing...it was such a let down when the Creep was revealed.<br /><br />On top of this, some of the stuff in this movie makes no sense. (Spoiler) <br /><br />Why the hell does the Creep kill the security Guard? Whats the point, apart from sticking a great honking sign up that says \"HI I'm A PSYCHO AND I LIVE DOWN HERE!\"? Its stupid, and only seems to happen to prevent Franka Potente's character from getting help.<br /><br />what the hells he been eating down there? I got the impression he was effectively walled in, and only the unexpected opening into that tunnel section let him loose...so has he been munching rats all that time, and if so why do they hang around him so much? Why is he so damn hard to kill? He's thin, malnourished and not exactly at peak performance...but seems to keep going despite injuries that are equivalent to those that .cripple the non-psycho characters in the film.<br /><br />The DVD commentary says we are intended to empathise with Creep, but I just find him loathsome. Its an effective enough movie, but it wasted so many opportunities that it makes me

{"value":"\"Witchery\" might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but, luckily enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. Honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense, but who cares when Linda Blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut lips, upside down crucifixions, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts. The young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. They're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. Anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of \"The Evil Dead\". The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. There's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.","finished_norm":["witcheri","mai","just","be","the","much","incoher","and","lament","script","horror","movi","of","the","but","luckili","enough","it","have","a","few","compens","qualiti","like","fantast","gore","effect","a","exhilar","music","score","and","some","terrif","cast","choic","honestli","the","screenplai","doe","not","make","on","iota","of","sens","but","who","care","when","linda","blair","with","a","explod","hairstyl","portrai","yet","anoth","girl","possess","by","evil","power","and","david","hasselhof","depict","a","hunki","photograph","who","ca","not","seem","to","get","lai","in","a","movi","that","constantli","featur","bloodi","voodoo","sewnshut","lip","upsid","down","crucifixion","viciou","burn","and","a","overus","but","genuin","creepi","tune","eight","random","peopl","be","gather","togeth","on","a","abandon","vacat","resort","island","off","the","coast","of","massachusett","the","young","coupl","be","there","to","investig","the","place","dark","histori","the","dysfunct","famili","with","a","pregnant","linda","blair","even","though","nobodi","seem","to","bother","about","who","the","father","be","and","what","hi","whereabout","be","consid","reopen","the","hotel","and","the","yummi","femal","architect","simpli","tag","along","for","casual","sex","thei","re","forc","to","stai","the","night","in","the","ramshackl","hotel","and","then","suddenli","the","previou","landladi","a","ag","actress","or","someth","who","alwai","dress","in","black","start","take","them","out","in","variou","engross","wai","everyth","be","somehow","relat","to","the","intro","sequenc","show","a","woman","accus","of","witcheri","jump","out","of","a","window","anywai","the","plot","be","definit","of","minor","import","in","a","italian","horror","franchis","that","start","a","a","unoffici","spinoff","of","the","evil","dead","the","atmospher","be","occasion","unsettl","and","the","makeup","effect","be","undoubtedli","the","much","superior","elem","of","the","entir","film","there","someth","suprem","morbid","and","unsettl","about","stare","at","a","defenseless","woman","hang","upsid","down","a","chimnei","and","wait","to","get","fry"],"filtered":["witcheri","mai","much","incoher","lament","script","horror","movi","luckili","enough","compens","qualiti","like","fantast","gore","effect","exhilar","music","score","terrif","cast","choic","honestli","screenplai","doe","make","iota","sens","care","linda","blair","explod","hairstyl","portrai","yet","anoth","girl","possess","evil","power","david","hasselhof","depict","hunki","photograph","ca","seem","get","lai","movi","constantli","featur","bloodi","voodoo","sewnshut","lip","upsid","crucifixion","viciou","burn","overus","genuin","creepi","tune","eight","random","peopl","gather","togeth","abandon","vacat","resort","island","coast","massachusett","young","coupl","investig","place","dark","histori","dysfunct","famili","pregnant","linda","blair","even","though","nobodi","seem","bother","father","hi","whereabout","consid","reopen","hotel","yummi","femal","architect","simpli","tag","along","casual","sex","thei","re","forc","stai","night","ramshackl","hotel","suddenli","previou","landladi","ag","actress","someth","alwai","dress","black","start","take","variou","engross","wai","everyth","somehow","relat","intro","sequenc","show","woman","accus","witcheri","jump","window","anywai","plot","definit","minor","import","italian","horror","franchis","start","unoffici","spinoff","evil","dead","atmospher","occasion","unsettl","makeup","effect","undoubtedli","much","superior","elem","entir","film","someth","suprem","morbid","unsettl","stare","defenseless","woman","hang","upsid","chimnei","wait","get","fry"],"filtered2":["witcheri","mai","incoher","lament","script","horror","luckili","enough","compens","qualiti","like","fantast","gore","effect","exhilar","music","score","terrif","cast","choic","honestli","screenplai","doe","make","iota","sens","care","linda","blair","explod","hairstyl","portrai","yet","anoth","girl","possess","evil","power","david","hasselhof","depict","hunki","photograph","ca","seem","get","lai","constantli","featur","bloodi","voodoo","sewnshut","lip","upsid","crucifixion","viciou","burn","overus","genuin","creepi","tune","eight","random","peopl","gather","togeth","abandon","vacat","resort","island","coast","massachusett","young","coupl","investig","place","dark","histori","dysfunct","famili","pregnant","linda","blair","even","though","nobodi","seem","bother","father","whereabout","consid","reopen","hotel","yummi","femal","architect","simpli","tag","along","casual","sex","re","forc","stai","night","ramshackl","hotel","suddenli","previou","landladi","ag","actress","someth","alwai","dress","black","start","take","variou","engross","wai","everyth","somehow","relat","intro","sequenc","show","woman","accus","witcheri","jump","window","anywai","plot","definit","minor","import","italian","horror","franchis","start","unoffici","spinoff","evil","dead","atmospher","occasion","unsettl","mak

{"value":"(Spoilers galore) This is an absolutely awful film. First of all it has that guy from medium. I guess he's made a career out of playing super doting dads. It was OK the first time he tried to scare his son by pretending to be a monster...but then 10 minutes later they cloyingly did it again! And so it goes, this film moves in excruciating real time. At one point, I started imaging it was days later, until I was reminded that the story line was only at the next day...in the early afternoon still! I'm not really sure who this couple is supposed to be in real life. First of all they are presented as sort of a Manhattan yuppie couple who grew up and had a kid. But they drive an old blue Volvo. Those types stopped driving Volvos decades ago. Today they drive Priuses. But in 2002, I'm sure they still weren't driving Volvos.<br /><br />OK, then there's Wendigo. A \"mysterious Indian man\" gives the boy a little magic Wendigo statue and tells him of its powerful magic. C'mon...are we still doing ancient Indian mysteries. Just to drive it home, they pan across every Indian statue in their tourist trap upstate New York town. American Indians are portrayed in a manner not seen for decades in this film! Oh, and about Wendigo. He is not actually the cause of the horror. He doesn't kill the kid's dad which is the most horrible thing in the film...he's just killed by an ordinary hick with a grudge and a high powered rifle. The Wendigo only comes out late in the film to avenge the guy who killed the dad...oh, but wait, it seemed earlier that Wendigo was kind of mad at the dad, maybe because he killed a deer...so then Wendigo must have been happy that the dad was killed...but...<br /><br />And so it goes...insulting, boring and nonsensical. There is no reason to watch this film at all.","finished_norm":["spoiler","galor","thi","be","a","absolut","aw","film","of","all","it","have","that","gui","from","medium","i","guess","he","make","a","career","out","of","plai","super","dote","dad","it","be","okai","the","time","he","try","to","scare","hi","son","by","pretend","to","be","a","monsterbut","then","minut","late","thei","cloyingli","do","it","again","and","so","it","go","thi","film","move","in","excruci","real","time","at","on","point","i","start","imag","it","be","dai","late","until","i","be","remind","that","the","stori","line","be","onli","at","the","next","dayin","the","earli","afternoon","still","i","be","not","realli","sure","who","thi","coupl","be","suppos","to","be","in","real","life","of","all","thei","be","present","a","sort","of","a","manhattan","yuppi","coupl","who","grow","up","and","have","a","kid","but","thei","drive","a","old","blue","volvo","that","typ","stop","drive","volvo","decad","ago","todai","thei","drive","prius","but","in","i","be","sure","thei","still","be","not","drive","volvosbr","br","okai","then","there","wendigo","a","mysteri","indian","man","give","the","boi","a","littl","magic","wendigo","statu","and","tell","him","of","it","power","magic","cmonar","we","still","do","ancient","indian","mysteri","just","to","drive","it","home","thei","pan","across","everi","indian","statu","in","their","tourist","trap","upstat","new","york","town","american","indian","be","portrai","in","a","manner","not","see","for","decad","in","thi","film","oh","and","about","wendigo","he","be","not","actual","the","caus","of","the","horror","he","doe","not","kill","the","kid","dad","which","be","the","much","horribl","thing","in","the","filmh","just","kill","by","a","ordinari","hick","with","a","grudg","and","a","high","power","rifl","the","wendigo","onli","come","out","late","in","the","film","to","aveng","the","gui","who","kill","the","dadoh","but","wait","it","seem","earli","that","wendigo","be","kind","of","mad","at","the","dad","mayb","becaus","he","kill","a","deerso","then","wendigo","must","have","be","happi","that","the","dad","be","killedbutbr","br","and","so","it","goesinsult","bore","and","nonsens","there","be","no","reason","to","watch","thi","film","at","all"],"filtered":["spoiler","galor","thi","absolut","aw","film","gui","medium","guess","make","career","plai","super","dote","dad","okai","time","try","scare","hi","son","pretend","monsterbut","minut","late","thei","cloyingli","go","thi","film","move","excruci","real","time","point","start","imag","dai","late","remind","stori","line","onli","next","dayin","earli","afternoon","still","realli","sure","thi","coupl","suppos","real","life","thei","present","sort","manhattan","yuppi","coupl","grow","kid","thei","drive","old","blue","volvo","typ","stop","drive","volvo","decad","ago","todai","thei","drive","prius","sure","thei","still","drive","volvosbr","br","okai","wendigo","mysteri","indian","man","give","boi","littl","magic","wendigo","statu","tell","power","magic","cmonar","still","ancient","indian","mysteri","drive","home","thei","pan","across","everi","indian","statu","tourist","trap","upstat","new","york","town","american","indian","portrai","manner","see","decad","thi","film","oh","wendigo","actual","caus","horror","doe","kill","kid","dad","much","horribl","thing","filmh","kill","ordinari","hick","grudg","high","power","rifl","wendigo","onli","come","late","film","aveng","gui","kill","dadoh","wait","seem","earli","wendigo","kind","mad","dad","mayb","becaus","kill","deerso","wendigo","must","happi","dad","killedbutbr","br","goesinsult","bore","nonsens","reason","watch","thi","film"],"filtered2":["spoiler","galor","absolut","aw","gui","medium","guess","make","career","plai","super","dote","dad","okai","time","try","scare","son","pretend","monsterbut","minut","late","cloyingli","go","move","excruci","real","time","point","start","imag","dai","late","remind","stori","line","onli","next","dayin","earli","afternoon","still","realli","sure","coupl","suppos","real","life","present","sort","manhattan","yuppi","coupl","grow","kid","drive","old","blue","volvo","typ","stop","drive","volvo","decad","ago","todai","drive","prius","sure","still","drive","volvosbr","okai","wendigo","mysteri","indian","man","give","boi","littl","magic","wendigo","statu","tell","power","magic","cmonar","still","ancient","indian","mysteri","drive","home","pan","across","everi","indian","statu","tourist","trap","upstat","new","york","town","american","indian","portrai","manner","see","decad","oh","wendigo","actual","caus","horror","doe","kill","kid","dad","horribl","thing","filmh","kill","ordinari","hick","grudg","high","power","rifl","wendigo","onli","come","late","aveng","gui","kill","dadoh","wait","seem","earli","wendigo","kind","mad","dad","mayb","becaus","kill","deerso","wendigo","must","happi","dad","killedbutbr","goesinsult","bore","nonsens","reason","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,6,7,8,11,13,14,17,18,22,29,30,34,35,36,40,45,5

{"value":"This movie is written by Charlie Higson, who has before this done the \"legendary\" Fast Show and his own show based on one of Fast Show's characters (Tony the car sales man). He's also written James Bond books for kids.<br /><br />Actually I've seen before this only Gordon's movies that are based on Lovecraft's stories, and every one of those is marvelous. Here Gordon tries to do something different. The style is totally \"contemporary\", which means shaky camera, fast and strange cutting, cool chillout music in the background. It works quite well here, I guess, but it's still pointless and cheap. It makes me often think of the cameraman who's shaking his dv-camera in front of the actors/actresses and try to make stylish moves in the pictures (hoping that something tolerable would come out of it). The casting is good, and there is a whole atmosphere, which is the result of good directing. I think the main character, the \"zero\" young guy, is quite interesting in his \"zeroness\". The fat guy is also good. And the guy who looks like Alec Baldwin, but is not him. But pretty soon after the beginning the movie turns out to be something not-so-interesting: In this case I mean an endless line of scenes of sadism and sickness. There is not much humanity in this film/story: It's totally pessimistic, and every person in this movie is disgusting and hopeless, or soon dead. Needless to say that there is no humor either. It's a 1'40 long vomit without no relief in any moment. Anyway, Gordon remains to me one of the most interesting movie makers that are active today, and I think of this movie as an experiment, and as a failure in that. Everyone has to experience getting lost sometimes, just to learn and to find their way again. This might be Gordon's most uninteresting and empty

{"value":"As a huge fan of only the first 2 seasons of BSG and the stand alone feature BSG Razor I was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days. Usually I have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects. If the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little CGI money spent. This prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it. The virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous & unbelievable. This scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to Restricted. Not that teens don't love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex & violence & heavy dance music. Its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth & reason or political & religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that perplexes me. These kids are definitely not from this planet. The movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting. The scene with Eric Stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining. But this old concept was far better portrayed & much more believable in the brilliant, classic original \"Frankenstein\" with Boris Karloff. Caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old Hollywood horror film. No surprise there! Overall this movie was bland & unoriginal & cheap looking, using recycled CGI of Caprica from BSG. I doubt I'll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the Sci-Fi channel. Unless of course I happen to be suffering from a bad bout of insomnia at which time this show would definitely be the cure.

{"value":"i read the book \"7 years in Tibet\" from Heinrich Harrer and was fascinated of it. then i immediately grabbed the DVD and started to watch the movie. i remember the first time i saw it back in 98, i kinda liked it. well, now i watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based on. and soon i realized how WRONG it all was told:<br /><br />when they enter Lhasa the people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths and Thewlis and Pitt have the impression that its the way to say hello in Tibet, so they greet back... in the book Harrer explains, that sticking the tongue out is a sign of absolute humbleness and loyalty in Tibet and they may do it in front of the Dalai Lama but certainly not for these two europeans! not only the mother but even the Dalai Lama himself was wearing glasses in the public. in the book Harrer mentions, that no one in Tibet wore glasses to that time(sorry forgot the reason, but its explained in the book too).the young Dalai Lama did, but only when he was alone and nobody could see him! and what about that Mao tse tung lookalike, destroying the mandala in front of the young \"living buddha\"?? childish... and the tailor made Harrer and Aufschnaiter tibetan clothes not European designer suits! why are so many events that really happened eliminated from the story, just to fill the time with a fictional love interest (the female tailor...)that is completely unimportant? just like the whole story about harrers son, rolf. not one word is mentioned about him or even any family member of harrer in the book. but that was OK for me because \"7 years in Tibet\" is not a book about harrers person. its about tibet. I'm very disappointed by this \"adaption\" of the famous book. and i bet heinrich harrer was, too... 3 stars, just for the cinematography.","finished_norm":["i","read","the","book","year","in","tibet","from","heinrich","harrer","and","be","fascin","of","it","then","i","immedi","grab","the","dvd","and","start","to","watch","the","movi","i","rememb","the","time","i","see","it","back","in","i","kinda","like","it","good","now","i","watch","it","again","in","full","knowledg","of","the","book","it","be","base","on","and","soon","i","realiz","how","wrong","it","all","be","toldbr","br","when","thei","enter","lhasa","the","peopl","start","to","stick","their","tongu","out","of","their","mouth","and","thewli","and","pitt","have","the","impress","that","it","the","wai","to","sai","hello","in","tibet","so","thei","greet","back","in","the","book","harrer","explain","that","stick","the","tongu","out","be","a","sign","of","absolut","humbl","and","loyalti","in","tibet","and","thei","mai","do","it","in","front","of","the","dalai","lama","but","certainli","not","for","thi","two","european","not","onli","the","mother","but","even","the","dalai","lama","himself","be","wear","glass","in","the","public","in","the","book","harrer","mention","that","no","on","in","tibet","wear","glass","to","that","timesorri","forget","the","reason","but","it","explain","in","the","book","tooth","young","dalai","lama","do","but","onli","when","he","be","alon","and","nobodi","can","see","him","and","what","about","that","mao","tse","tung","lookalik","destroi","the","mandala","in","front","of","the","young","live","buddha","childish","and","the","tailor","make","harrer","and","aufschnait","tibetan","cloth","not","european","design","suit","why","be","so","mani","event","that","realli","happen","elimin","from","the","stori","just","to","fill","the","time","with","a","fiction","love","interest","the","femal","tailorthat","be","complet","unimport","just","like","the","whole","stori","about","harrer","son","rolf","not","on","word","be","mention","about","him","or","even","ani","famili","member","of","harrer","in","the","book","but","that","be","okai","for","me","becaus","year","in","tibet","be","not","a","book","about","harrer","person","it","about","tibet","i","be","veri","disappoint","by","thi","adapt","of","the","famou","book","and","i","bet","heinrich","harrer","be","too","star","just","for","the","cinematographi"],"filtered":["read","book","year","tibet","heinrich","harrer","fascin","immedi","grab","dvd","start","watch","movi","rememb","time","see","back","kinda","like","good","watch","full","knowledg","book","base","soon","realiz","wrong","toldbr","br","thei","enter","lhasa","peopl","start","stick","tongu","mouth","thewli","pitt","impress","wai","sai","hello","tibet","thei","greet","back","book","harrer","explain","stick","tongu","sign","absolut","humbl","loyalti","tibet","thei","mai","front","dalai","lama","certainli","thi","two","european","onli","mother","even","dalai","lama","wear","glass","public","book","harrer","mention","tibet","wear","glass","timesorri","forget","reason","explain","book","tooth","young","dalai","lama","onli","alon","nobodi","see","mao","tse","tung","lookalik","destroi","mandala","front","young","live","buddha","childish","tailor","make","harrer","aufschnait","tibetan","cloth","european","design","suit","mani","event","realli","happen","elimin","stori","fill","time","fiction","love","interest","femal","tailorthat","complet","unimport","like","whole","stori","harrer","son","rolf","word","mention","even","ani","famili","member","harrer","book","okai","becaus","year","tibet","book","harrer","person","tibet","veri","disappoint","thi","adapt","famou","book","bet","heinrich","harrer","star","cinematographi"],"filtered2":["read","book","year","tibet","heinrich","harrer","fascin","immedi","grab","dvd","start","watch","rememb","time","see","back","kinda","like","good","watch","full","knowledg","book","base","soon","realiz","wrong","toldbr","enter","lhasa","peopl","start","stick","tongu","mouth","thewli","pitt","impress","wai","hello","tibet","greet","back","book","harrer","explain","stick","tongu","sign","absolut","humbl","loyalti","tibet","mai","front","dalai","lama","certainli","two","european","onli","mother","even","dalai","lama","wear","glass","public","book","harrer","mention","tibet","wear","glass","timesorri","forget","reason","explain","book","tooth","young","dalai","lama","onli","alon","nobodi","see","mao","tse","tung","lookalik","destroi","mandala","front","young","live","buddha","childish","tailor","make","harrer","aufschnait","tibetan","cloth","european","design","suit","mani","event","realli","happen","elimin","stori","fill","time","fiction","love","interest","femal","tailorthat","complet","unimport","like","whole","stori","harrer","son","rolf","word","mention","even","ani","famili","member","harrer","book","okai","becaus","year","tibet","book","harrer","person","tibet","veri","disappoint","adapt","famou","book","bet","heinrich","harrer","star","cinematographi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,8,11,13,15,17,22,23,25

{"value":"I thought that this movies was a letdown I expected it to be so much better than it was. I am so glad I didn't pay to see this movie and that I didn't sit in a movie theater for this one. Where to begin on this movie, the acting in this movie was average, the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasn't special. I thought that this movie was suppose to be great, but it wasn't more than a cheesy waste of time. I think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just wasn't there. I think that if maybe we had a different actor play Kirk than Jay Baruchel it might have been better but the entire time I watched this movie he looked high and I didn't get the feeling that he wasn't acting in this movie. Now, Alice Eve did a great job as an actress but, there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie. The humor in this movie was not funny at all, there were a few one liners in this movie that were OK but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand. I think that Jim Field Smith had a hard time with this because he couldn't decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. I honestly think he needs to stick with the Burger King commercials. I think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director. The storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just OK guy love storyboring I think that it would have been better if it had more originality, but what a letdown nothing. I honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie. I think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie.

{"value":"A sad, sad sight indeed is The Munster's Revenge. The Munsters are brought back one last time(Fred Gywnne received a huge paycheck to come back to the role of Herman Munster)in this made-for-TV movie about a pair of wax replicas of Grandpa and Herman that are robots \"terrorizing\" the city as preparation for a robbery of a mummy's stash at an exhibit. With the police on their heels, the two elderly television icons try to find out who is actually behind the crimes in order to clear their names. We get to see them dress in drag as waitresses(a minor highpoint in the film), grandpa turns into a bat with attached wire a couple times(one time even flying to Transylvania with Herman somehow invoking his frequent flyer miles I guess), and a most annoying relative \"the Phantom\" constantly sings and breaks glass ad nausium! What is most sad is hard to pinpoint: is it that Gywnne(especially) and Al Lewis look so haggard in every scene and so indifferent to the material. Is it the hokey costumes of the robots that have that school production values look about them. Maybe it is the ridiculous script. Sid Caesar's crazy, mostly unfunny antics. Or perhaps it is seeing something which brought me joy and fond memories as a child being treated to a super K-Mart fashion makeover. At any even, the result is decidedly disappointing and silly even for Munster standards. As for the rest of the cast, Yvonne De Carlo is adequate in a most vacuous role(though showing more cleavage than usual for a woman of her years and experience). K. C. Martell makes an ever-so-not affable Eddie Munster. Jo McDonell is an attractive Marilyn. Bob Hastings as the aforementioned Phantom looks and acts and speaks in the most absurd manner.

{"value":"Despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in New Zealand, any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved. Apart from a clichés-only plot, the movie is let down by some weak acting, accents, and overall lack of tension.<br /><br />Whilst having the overall look of a big budget (for NZ), the feel is decidedly small-town Kiwi...<br /><br />Has anyone not seen The Brothers ?? ( http://imdb.com/title/tt0250274/ ) Those who have will pick the similarities straightaway....I've heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clichéd \"boys talking crap\", but it comes across as forced...<br /><br />I believe Oscar Keightley sees himself as deeply ironic, but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious.<br /><br />Those who have any doubts left at all that Samoans-living-in-NZ culture has been deeply , hopefully not permanently ,affected by American speech , culture, and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie.<br /><br />Robbie magasiva always looks good on screen , but is let down by the script..<br /><br />It always rubs me up the wrong way when a \"comedy\" has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way, you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clichéd punchline - see the wanna be white boy...<br /><br />I know someone who found this movie hilarious -however, that person has the brains of a tadpole, and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars....<br /><br />That kinda sums up the mentality of this flick , OK but not great , fun but not funny.....Wake up NZ - this is NOT a 5 star movie despite all the glowing (middle class white guilt ?? :-) ) reviews....<br /><br />My advice ? if you watch it, get

{"value":"I just finished watching this movie. It wasn't ridiculously bad, but I'm really disappointed with it. I'm not really sure why someone would make a movie like this. It was marginally entertaining, but I feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making. Monday, the writer was in charge; Tuesday, the director; Wednesday, the guy who gets the coffee; etc. It almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies, but only had the time and money to make one.<br /><br />Someone else commented that the acting was really good, but I'd have to disagree. Then again, if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming, perhaps they're better actors than I give them credit for.<br /><br />The back of the DVD gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery... something along the lines of a historical Law and Order or National Treasure. It starts off like that, but then, out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the Twilight Zone, or... what was that other show that wasn't as good... A bad episode of The Outer Limits.<br /><br />My main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out. There's the evil guy with spiked white hair. There's the love interest, who, when she first appears, the wind actually blows through her hair. Seriously. Once you realize it's a Christian movie, the end is also pretty easy to spot.<br /><br />The cinematography was poorly done, especially in the opening scenes - way to put your best foot forward. It wasn't atrocious for most of the movie, but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady, praying, arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking - the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the

{"value":"This movie probably had some potential for something; my bewilderment is how these utterly prosaic unfunny themes keep making it to theaters, it's as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are. Truly the decerebrate oafs behind most films are like dogs, they return to ingest their own vomit. Well, they're 19 bucks richer now because of me. This was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer (and nothing amusing was in the trailer), performances were strained (especially Molly's, totally unconvincing). What was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney films; none of his analogies hit home, his little moral speeches were flat, I was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful, only to find out he was done. The so-called \"hard 10\" is the most insipid plastic creature there is (apart from having a horse-like face with a weird smile); I honestly found her friend Patty (referred to as the Hamburglar) to be much better looking than her. But then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes ;) Well, anyway, the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facades; the way they showed this, with a dude shaving another's scrotum and the million-times-mutilated-and-beaten-to-death-horse premature ejaculation routine (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the latter in the disgusting scene denouement involving the family dog). I feel as if the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes into an unformed wretched ball of raw sewage. Goes to show marketing can push anything out there, shine whatever fetid mass and call it gold, people will come (worked for me).

{"value":"This can't be Mandy Schaffer's last film. Somebody, do something! :-(<br /><br />Argh.<br /><br />What little life this one might have had, the directing finished off. Don't blame the cast; they did OK. Even the winemaker's younger brother was pretty well done, and he didn't even get into the movie until halfway through. And please, please put Mandy in some more movies! She's too beautiful to bury her career at such a young age. Ya' breakin' my haht, heah....<br /><br />Two specific criticisms, in case anyone cares (apparently nobody liked this movie very much). First, the way Traci kept popping up at just the right melodramatic moment, in order to see whatever she was supposed to see, and never got seen in return, was very annoying. Hollywood: please stop giving villains perfect timing luck which runs out exactly when the climax arrives. It's dumb. Write better scripts so you won't have to use that lame plot device any more. If your script isn't good enough to stand up without that, then don't produce it.<br /><br />Second, Carmen wouldn't have fallen for that fake injury trick that Traci pulled. She already had Traci fingered. More bad writing/directing there.<br /><br />I could trash this movie further but mercy forbids it. Actually I didn't hate it as much as the others seem to have. It just didn't have much of a reason for being made, unless it was purely a vehicle to show off the lovely Mandy. Oh, and to whoever didn't think she was sexy... the character wasn't very well written, but how can you say she wasn't sexy?!? One or the other of us needs glasses, and I don't think it's me.<br /><br />MORE MANDY. (Not to be confused with \"Moore, Mandy\" -- although I'd like to see her again too. ;-)<br /><br />P.S.

{"value":"Extremely disappointing film based on the James Michener novel.<br /><br />What was even worse was Marlon Brando's performance. His southern drawl was ridiculous. I found myself laughing when he spoke as he sounded like an elderly southern lady coming home to roost. Brando, so great in previous films, was reduced here to a laughing stock. Tyrone Power, in \"Witness for the Prosecution,\" should have been nominated for best actor instead of Brando here.<br /><br />The film, dealing with racism, dealt with the U.S. government's attempt to avoid marriages between U.S. soldiers and Japanese women.<br /><br />Brando was stone-faced throughout the movie. His moving from anti-these relationships to a pro one occurs when he finds love with an Asian woman. His emotions and talk made it difficult to see how he could espouse such new views.<br /><br />Only the lord knows why Red Buttons and Miyoshi Umeki received supporting Oscars for their performances. Nothing about either performance was equally impressive. Umeki's appearance on the screen was short and without much of anything being depicted on her part. A better performance in this film was done by Miiko Taka, who did nicely as Brando's love interest. She showed great emotion as the anti-American who found love with the Brando character. Her face was etched with the unhappiness she had for losing her father and brother in World War 11. She realized that her dancing was not her way out of this existence that she was living.<br /><br />Martha Scott went from the Hebrew mother Yochobel in \"The Ten Commandments\" to the bigoted mother of Brando's love interest at first. Her performance together with the one of Ricardo Montalban was wasted. Patricia Owens, as Brando's first love, showed depth and conviction in her

{"value":"Well...overall, this movie was pretty much worthless, and it's basically a horror movie that ended up being more of a comedy. I just rented this movie last night when me and my friends went to blockbuster looking for a scary movie. This definitely wasn't what we were looking for, but it satisfied us for humor. The actors in this movie (especially Brandon) are so fake that it's funny. And especially that Tracy girl whenever she's in the boarded up room telling the clown to go away. They show almost no emotion and it's just so obvious that they're acting. And also when the clown is looking through that black box paper thing and grabs Mark, he doesn't even look like he's scared even though the clown like grabbed him and started attacking him. And seriously, would you just be JOGGING if you were being chased down? I'd be sprinting for my life! (Even though anyone could probably outrun that clown because he's like 300 lbs.) Not to mention that the effects aren't that great, like whenever the clown chops off Susan's head in the forest, then whenever he throws her head into the boarded up room with Denise and Tracy whenever Denise throws the head back over. Also like in the previous guy's comment, the beginning makes absolutely NO sense and I don't even see why it was even included in the movie. So what, was this movie made in 2003? The music made it sound like it was made in like the 1980's, and the camera-ing(?) doesn't even really look professional. Half of the time, it seems like the camera can't even stay steady when it's suppose to be. Overall, I'd have to say I enjoyed the movie. I wouldn't recommend it though if you're trying to find something to scare you, but if you're looking for something to maybe make fun of or get a laugh out of, I'd recommend it for sure.","finished_norm":["welloveral","thi","movi","be","pretti","much","worthless","and","it","basic","a","horror","movi","that","end","up","be","much","of","a","comedi","i","just","rent","thi","movi","last","night","when","me","and","my","friend","go","to","blockbust","look","for","a","scari","movi","thi","definit","be","not","what","we","be","look","for","but","it","satisfi","u","for","humor","the","actor","in","thi","movi","especi","brandon","be","so","fake","that","it","funni","and","especi","that","traci","girl","whenev","she","in","the","board","up","room","tell","the","clown","to","go","awai","thei","show","almost","no","emot","and","it","just","so","obviou","that","thei","re","act","and","conjur","when","the","clown","be","look","through","that","black","box","paper","thing","and","grab","mark","he","doe","not","even","look","like","he","scare","even","though","the","clown","like","grab","him","and","start","attack","him","and","serious","would","you","just","be","jog","if","you","be","be","chase","down","i","have","be","sprint","for","my","life","even","though","anyon","can","probabl","outrun","that","clown","becaus","he","like","lb","not","to","mention","that","the","effect","be","not","that","great","like","whenev","the","clown","chop","off","susan","head","in","the","forest","then","whenev","he","throw","her","head","into","the","board","up","room","with","denis","and","traci","whenev","denis","throw","the","head","back","over","conjur","like","in","the","previou","gui","comment","the","begin","make","absolut","no","sens","and","i","do","not","even","see","why","it","be","even","includ","in","the","movi","so","what","be","thi","movi","make","in","the","music","make","it","sound","like","it","be","make","in","like","the","and","the","camera","doe","not","even","realli","look","profession","half","of","the","time","it","seem","like","the","camera","ca","not","even","stai","steadi","when","it","suppos","to","be","overal","i","have","have","to","sai","i","enjoi","the","movi","i","would","not","recommend","it","though","if","you","re","try","to","find","someth","to","scare","you","but","if","you","re","look","for","someth","to","mayb","make","fun","of","or","get","a","laugh","out","of","i","have","recommend","it","for","sure"],"filtered":["welloveral","thi","movi","pretti","much","worthless","basic","horror","movi","end","much","comedi","rent","thi","movi","last","night","friend","go","blockbust","look","scari","movi","thi","definit","look","satisfi","u","humor","actor","thi","movi","especi","brandon","fake","funni","especi","traci","girl","whenev","board","room","tell","clown","go","awai","thei","show","almost","emot","obviou","thei","re","act","conjur","clown","look","black","box","paper","thing","grab","mark","doe","even","look","like","scare","even","though","clown","like","grab","start","attack","serious","jog","chase","sprint","life","even","though","anyon","probabl","outrun","clown","becaus","like","lb","mention","effect","great","like","whenev","clown","chop","susan","head","forest","whenev","throw","head","board","room","denis","traci","whenev","denis","throw","head","back","conjur","like","previou","gui","comment","begin","make","absolut","sens","even","see","even","includ","movi","thi","movi","make","music","make","sound","like","make","like","camera","doe","even","realli","look","profession","half","time","seem","like","camera","ca","even","stai","steadi","suppos","overal","sai","enjoi","movi","recommend","though","re","try","find","someth","scare","re","look","someth","mayb","make","fun","get","laugh","recommend","sure"],"filtered2":["welloveral","pretti","worthless","basic","horror","end","comedi","rent","last","night","friend","go","blockbust","look","scari","definit","look","satisfi","u","humor","actor","especi","brandon","fake","funni","especi","traci","girl","whenev","board","room","tell","clown","go","awai","show","almost","emot","obviou","re","act","conjur","clown","look","black","box","paper","thing","grab","mark","doe","even","look","like","scare","even","though","clown","like","grab","start","attack","serious","jog","chase","sprint","life","even","though","anyon","probabl","outrun","clown","becaus","like","lb","mention","effect","great","like","whenev","clown","chop","susan","head","forest","whenev","throw","head","board","room","denis","traci","whenev","denis","throw","head","back","conjur","like","previou","gui","comment","begin","make","absolut","sens","even","see","even","includ","make","music","make","sound","like","make","like","camera","doe","even","realli","look","profession","half","time","seem","like","camera","ca","even","stai","steadi","suppos","overal","enjoi","recommend","though","re","try","find","someth","scare","re","look","someth","mayb","make","fun","get","laugh","recommend","sure"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,4,5,6,8,13,16,18,21,22,24,28,29,35,36,38,39,41,51,53,55,62,63,68,71,75,78,81,83,84,86,90,106,112,118,119,127,131,133,144,147,148,

{"value":"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />The American military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other. A renegade pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and plots to hold the US government to ransom with it. So they are forced to send in their best man John Sands (Seagal, who else?) to stop him, in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he's learned over the years.<br /><br />I skipped Attack Force because I could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what I thought. But I decided to give FOF a go because Shadow Man (by the same director) wasn't bad and, what the hell, Seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe, just maybe, he could make a great film again. Oh what a fool I was.<br /><br />Dubbing, horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets, awful camera work, cheap production values, risible, unconvincing fight scenes that have become Seagal's trademark and a boring, sleep inducing plot that doesn't go anywhere.<br /><br />Thankfully his next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I'll be skipping), apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony, meaning no more of these awful European lensed action films and his next film Prince of Pistols might mark a return to theatres.

{"value":"Oh, for crying out loud, this has got to be the LAMEST movie I've seen all year, and I'm sorry the normally awesome John Cusack was even involved in this brainless, twitty piece of Stupidity. Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message, albeit on a more subtle, somewhat more mature level, Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer, and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so (and that's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back again, thank you very much!!). It's bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen-year-olds (actually I've known better fourteen-year-olds...), except maybe for Jeremy Piven, who was enjoyable enough. Just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where Kate Beckinsale's character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind (literally) had my best friend and I irritated beyond belief. I told my husband Rockstar had more intelligence, and at least, the characters in Rockstar weren't half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this \"Serendipitous\" mess. It's annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives, and feel they're nothing more than puppets to destiny and the whims of fate. How utterly tiresome. I'm sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who'd rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences. After all, here's a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other people's lives (namely their respective fiancées), not to mention other

{"value":"Contrary to its title, this film offers no spice and thus audience is subjected to a tasteless dish. All Humor appears forced, theatrical, mechanical, staged, reminiscent of those Pakistani plays available on video, including even the mannerisms. Everybody is screaming, shouting and doing odd things for no reason. The premise looks interesting as it is a straight lift from Hollywood's 'Boeing Boeing\". John Abraham who is so natural in almost all his films is a complete misfit here. If we keep morality factor aside, even then the bizarre events looks trite. Akshay Kumar and Paresh Rawal, two experienced stalwarts try hard to lift the film by being natural but in vain. At least, the characters of three girls should be made contrasting in order to bring some interesting elements but sadly here too all of them appears those brainless, buxomed bimbettes (3Bs) who talk, behave and even scream in quite similar fashion. The major hole in the plot is what made the protagonist keep the three girls at his same home pretending that they will never get to know about each other? Just to do some Sex, what else? The same could be done in hundreds of other ways. Therefore so much dramabaazi for no reason is not something audience will digest easily. But surely, great flesh show and tempting promos always gives such films a great initial. Now for those who call it a situational comedy, I call it a pathetic taste. Sense of humor of such cinema going audience is surely gone corrupted and demented to the extent that they are connecting to a sadistic, weird and maddening type of humor, where it is not the characters that they laugh at but rather at themselves and at their own frustrations that look how senseless we have become that in order to laugh we have to bear with such

{"value":"... or an audience. A quick recap....<br /><br />So you've got this doctor who's been experimenting with stolen body parts for some vague reason. He wants to perfect transplants, but feels he needs to do this in his basement. WTF??? And then suddenly, unfortunately, and conveniently, his fiancé gets her head cut off in a traffic accident that HE'S responsible for. Agonized with grief, he preserves her head in a lasagna pan (or is it strudel?) and pumps it full of \"adreno-serum\" (sic) to keep it alive. And then she awakes, talking her head off (so to speak) even though her neck was obviously severed at the vocal cords, and she has no lungs so she couldn't speak even if she had 'em. Seems the ungrateful b*tch doesn't appreciate all that her fiancé has done for her. Just like a woman.....<br /><br />Then his grief turns to horniness as he sees the possibility of grafting his beloved's head onto the body of the first sleazy bimbo he can pick up off the street. Meanwhile, the doctor's assistant, a sort of dime-store Igor, gets into philosophical arguments with the head, who has struck up a telekinetic friendship with the \"monster in the closet\" (every mad scientist has one). Eventually the screenwriter realizes that he can't keep inflicting his misogyny and fear of intimacy issues on the audience ad infinitum, so he kills everybody, then presumably goes to the bank to cash the check before the movie's financial backers have a chance to stop payment on it. <br /><br />Have I mentioned that I think this is a bad movie?<br /><br />Someone should tell Turner Classic Movies to stop showing that edited version without the gory stuff. The sight of the assistant with his arm ripped off, pirouetting around the house without leaving much blood anywhere is just too precious.","finished_norm":["or","a","audienc","a","quick","recapbr","br","so","you","have","get","thi","doctor","who","be","experi","with","steal","bodi","part","for","some","vagu","reason","he","want","to","perfect","transplant","but","feel","he","ne","to","do","thi","in","hi","basem","wtf","and","then","suddenli","unfortun","and","conveni","hi","fiancé","get","her","head","cut","off","in","a","traffic","accid","that","he","respons","for","agon","with","grief","he","preserv","her","head","in","a","lasagna","pan","or","be","it","strudel","and","pump","it","full","of","adrenoserum","sic","to","keep","it","aliv","and","then","she","awak","talk","her","head","off","so","to","speak","even","though","her","neck","be","obvious","sever","at","the","vocal","cord","and","she","have","no","lung","so","she","can","not","speak","even","if","she","have","em","seem","the","ungrat","btch","doe","not","appreci","all","that","her","fiancé","have","do","for","her","just","like","a","womanbr","br","then","hi","grief","turn","to","horni","a","he","see","the","possibl","of","graft","hi","belov","head","onto","the","bodi","of","the","sleazi","bimbo","he","can","pick","up","off","the","street","meanwhil","the","doctor","assist","a","sort","of","dimestor","igor","get","into","philosoph","argum","with","the","head","who","have","strike","up","a","telekinet","friendship","with","the","monster","in","the","closet","everi","mad","scientist","have","on","eventu","the","screenwrit","realiz","that","he","ca","not","keep","inflict","hi","misogyni","and","fear","of","intimaci","issu","on","the","audienc","ad","infinitum","so","he","kill","everybodi","then","presum","go","to","the","bank","to","cash","the","check","befor","the","movi","financi","backer","have","a","chanc","to","stop","payment","on","it","br","br","have","i","mention","that","i","think","thi","be","a","bad","moviebr","br","someon","should","tell","turner","classic","movi","to","stop","show","that","edit","version","without","the","gori","stuff","the","sight","of","the","assist","with","hi","arm","rip","off","pirouett","around","the","hous","without","leav","much","blood","anywher","be","just","too","preciou"],"filtered":["audienc","quick","recapbr","br","get","thi","doctor","experi","steal","bodi","part","vagu","reason","want","perfect","transplant","feel","ne","thi","hi","basem","wtf","suddenli","unfortun","conveni","hi","fiancé","get","head","cut","traffic","accid","respons","agon","grief","preserv","head","lasagna","pan","strudel","pump","full","adrenoserum","sic","keep","aliv","awak","talk","head","speak","even","though","neck","obvious","sever","vocal","cord","lung","speak","even","em","seem","ungrat","btch","doe","appreci","fiancé","like","womanbr","br","hi","grief","turn","horni","see","possibl","graft","hi","belov","head","onto","bodi","sleazi","bimbo","pick","street","meanwhil","doctor","assist","sort","dimestor","igor","get","philosoph","argum","head","strike","telekinet","friendship","monster","closet","everi","mad","scientist","eventu","screenwrit","realiz","ca","keep","inflict","hi","misogyni","fear","intimaci","issu","audienc","ad","infinitum","kill","everybodi","presum","go","bank","cash","check","befor","movi","financi","backer","chanc","stop","payment","br","br","mention","think","thi","bad","moviebr","br","someon","tell","turner","classic","movi","stop","show","edit","version","without","gori","stuff","sight","assist","hi","arm","rip","pirouett","around","hous","without","leav","much","blood","anywher","preciou"],"filtered2":["audienc","quick","recapbr","get","doctor","experi","steal","bodi","part","vagu","reason","want","perfect","transplant","feel","ne","basem","wtf","suddenli","unfortun","conveni","fiancé","get","head","cut","traffic","accid","respons","agon","grief","preserv","head","lasagna","pan","strudel","pump","full","adrenoserum","sic","keep","aliv","awak","talk","head","speak","even","though","neck","obvious","sever","vocal","cord","lung","speak","even","em","seem","ungrat","btch","doe","appreci","fiancé","like","womanbr","grief","turn","horni","see","possibl","graft","belov","head","onto","bodi","sleazi","bimbo","pick","street","meanwhil","doctor","assist","sort","dimestor","igor","get","philosoph","argum","head","strike","telekinet","friendship","monster","closet","everi","mad","scientist","eventu","screenwrit","realiz","ca","keep","inflict","misogyni","fear","intimaci","issu","audienc","ad","infinitum","kill","everybodi","presum","go","bank","cash","check","befor","financi","backer","chanc","stop","payment","mention","think","bad","moviebr","someon","tell","turner","classic","stop","show","edit","version","without","gori","stuff","sight","assist","arm","rip","pirouett","around","hous","without","leav","blood","anywher","preciou"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,6,9,12,18,28,35,37,43,61,74,76,79,81,85,86,90,95,96,98,110,125,134,139,168,186,208,213,220,227,269,285,303,315,316,332,333,336,341,344,348,354,361,376,402,405,413,4

{"value":"The Sentinel represents everything about the soul-lessness of Hollywood and the saddening lack of imagination present in so many movies these days. I cannot possibly think of one good thing about it, it's all so generic, so factory-made and so lazy assembled that it really only exists as an infomercial on how to make money from the unsuspecting, undeserving public.<br /><br />A plot about a Secret Service Agent planning to assassinate the Prez could well be entertaining. If handled by a good director or caring cast that is. Douglas is the one who is framed. Basinger is the First Lady, with whom he is having an affair (an undeveloped, unresolved plot contrivance). Sutherland is the best pal who believes his guilty because there would be no movie if he didn't. And Longoria is nothing. A woman with a fortune of Maybelline and...that's it. I guess there are less requirements for women when entering the Secret Service. As usual in a film like this the role of the Prez himself is nothing more than a tool, a token and is very badly written.<br /><br />Clark Johnson's, he who gave us the equally as pathetic SWAT back in 2003, mechanical direction lacks any kind of signature and has all the visual sophistication of a cheap TV-movie. Douglas, Basinger and Sutherland look incredibly bored and phone-in their performances from afar. Eva Longoria, the most over-exposed woman of the 21st Century, is basically only in this to attract to the Desperate Housewives audience. Her role is 100% pointless and she does absolutely nothing to further the plot or add to character development. She barely has 2 lines to rub together.

{"value":"-=contains spoiler from both original and movie versions=-<br /><br />i am a huge fan of Notre dame De Paris musical,i also read book this summer and i watched movie today,in the beginning i was hopeful to watch a good film especially when i saw 6.3 IMDb point.first scenes were good but i actually waited for,theaters scene directly from book,but it was normal but when Esmeralda kisses gringoire i felt something is wrong..they don't even kiss in book,even in musical..<br /><br />and there were huge gap why Esmeralda being judged by sorcerer,in the book she teaches her goat how to respond numbers of clock or write word \"phoebus\".. wait there were a phoebus weren't there? in this movie he is some soldier junk nothing more,the creators made Quasimodo's love to show around and they even canceled Frollo's love..but Notre dame was frollo. his thoughts his struggles between love of god and love of human in movie we cant find anything like that all we have is,some villain who is really bad and kills people whose clashes with his thoughts..and not mentioning phoebus,not mentioning love of frollo,not mentioning jehan (brother of frollo) not mentioning mother of Esmeralda (maybe it is OK,the storyline would have chopped much)they even not mentioned the real story.. (another PS:frollo wasn't a opus dei or some cult member he actually in interest with alchemy he tries to make gold..he was stuck in science and religion)<br /><br />finally don't watch this movie,it

{"value":"Drew Barrymore plays young Holly Gooding, who moves in with aspiring hack screenwriter Patrick Highsmith (George Newbern) and completely disrupts his life by claiming that her \"doppelganger\", or evil twin, is out to kill her and her family.<br /><br />This silly horror film is kind of hard to take seriously, even if the film-makers and actors themselves seem to be dead serious. \"Doppelganger\" is muddled, with some unpleasantly dumb dialog.<br /><br />Some viewers will note that Drew's character's name is drawn from Audrey Hepburn's role in \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", and that Newbern's character's name is a play on the name of famed author Patricia Highsmith (he is actually trying to re-write \"Breakfast\" as a horror film, believe it or not!).<br /><br />I suppose that it deserves some credit for not being quite your typical horror film - I mean, writer/director Avi Nesher seems to genuinely care for his characters, and gives his film more plot than standard slasher fare.<br /><br />After a silly villain-explains-everything-to-the-audience confrontation, the film goes on to submit a hideous, out-there climax that has to be seen to be believed. This film certainly does not skimp on the gore.<br /><br />But hey! Drew kills her mother in this one. No, I'm not joking. Jaid Barrymore shows up near the beginning only to get violently slaughtered.<br /><br />Drew is always very watchable, and very sexy in this one. Newbern comes off as a likable-enough, \"nice\" sort of guy. But the highpoint of the film has to be the scene with Sally Kellerman, an attractive veteran who's very professional in her one scene as a former nun who's started a phone sex business(!!!!!!).<br

{"value":"A good cast is appallingly wasted in this slower than molasses and haphazardly connived comedy. Peter Ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a dour bore that misses all the right beats that might have made it watchable. Regardless of the favorable comments here, this film is awful. Badly directed. Badly edited. Badly acted. Badly written. You need to sit through a hundred movies to come across one this bad.<br /><br />The muddled and excruciatingly laggard plot concerns Ustinov conning his way into an American insurance company in order to hack their computer and embezzle millions of pounds. How he does it is beyond lameness and credibility (he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets, and hoodwinks computer expert Robert Morley into going to South America and stealing his identity).<br /><br />As a side plot, Ustinov romances fellow loner Maggie Smith, who just happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets a flat in her building. She ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with Bob Newhart that go nowhere, while Ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he Marries Smith and they fly off to Brazil, which has become the staple finale of almost every British caper comedy since (Nuns on the Run? A Fish Called Wanda?)<br /><br />The surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before. By the end I was thinking I must be truly off my rocker to stick out drivel like this. Even a cameo by Cesar Romero didn't help it. One of the most unfunny, poorly paced 'comedies' I've ever seen, and certainly the worst caper. Don't waste your time. If you love this you need to see better

{"value":"...through the similarly minded antics of Eric Stanze. A not-particularly talented director has helmed a not-particularly good movie, yet I still found myself sitting through it to the closing credits, if for nothing more than to see what happens next.<br /><br />A rapist escapes from prison and calls up his old flame. After capturing her (even though she came willingly) and threatening her into having sex (another event she was also willing to do) he reveals that he has kidnapped three guys who wronged her in the past. He then decides to kill her (huh?) but is foiled and dies instead. The girl's mind snaps (or something like that) and she takes out her rage on the unlucky chaps in the basement.<br /><br />Alright, the writing sucks: it's long winded, loaded with ten-cent words and there is WAY too much of it.<br /><br />The acting sucks: what a minute, what acting? <br /><br />The filming sucks: home video is bad enough, but 20 minutes of graveyard footage is just a damn insult.<br /><br />And the budget is a joke: get it...'budget', that was the punchline.<br /><br />And yet there was a charm to the thing. Back in the 70's these kind of movies came out in theatres with actual budgets and talent attached to them, not in this day and age though. If you want to watch this kind of violent, sexually exploitive trash (don't lie, some of us do) then this is all your gonna get nowadays.<br /><br />Some brief hardcore shots in a sex scene, torture with fecal material, fun with axes, anal rape by broom stick and a lengthy shot of the crazy chick masturbating with the same broom stick are some of the better items on the menu.<br /><br />It's not good and it won't be remembered, but not since the heyday of Joe D'amato have people made movies like this.<br /><br

{"value":"Okay, so, someone, somewhere, a few years ago, thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies stowing away aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon. So they did. Someone, somewhere, was an idiot.<br /><br />I want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware. As far as I can tell, the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on. The graphics in general were pretty good - the rocket launch gave me chills, like a good rocket launch always does (my Popular Mechanics flying-car gearhead blood still runs strong) and the 3D was pretty effective. The CG wasn't Pixar-quality, but it was generally good. The flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics, with some half-assed late-60s characters thrown in for colour (hippie flies, African-American flies with giant afros and black shades, etc.) and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads (although they made suitably gross squelching noises).<br /><br />The scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework, relying on offensive and outdated clichés (60s gender politics including mostly-useless female characters, racial stereotypes, evil Russians, a fat fly who only wants to eat, grade-two level gross-out humour). In a movie aimed for IMAX, they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel - they didn't get their physics right (zero-g in the Lunar Module during landing burn? PLEASE.) They couldn't even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts, all of which is in the public domain; instead they wrote their own dialogue, which sounds like crap.<br /><br />But we liked the maggots.<br /><br />So they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots.

{"value":"lets start off by saying that \"JAWANI DIWANI\" is just a pathetic movie. I agree with the last person who said \"I missed the joyride\". lol. <br /><br />The jokes were just terrible. Performances were average. Something went terribly wrong with the film. Emraan totally deserved something better. All CELINA JAITLEY did was expose. Hrishitta bhatt was OK. Emraan hashmi was OK too.<br /><br />MANN (EMRAAN HASHMI)is a desperate guy who wants to become famous. therefore, he uses RADHA and pretends he loves her, only because her father is a music director and could help him become famous (since, the father obeys everything his daughter says). One day, MANN and his friends go to GOA to have some fun. There he meets ROMA (CELINA JAITLEY) and totally falls for her looks and tries to flirt with her BLA BLA BLA. <br /><br />Then, that night ROMA cannot open the door to her room, and MANN decides to help her. Seeing that he cannot as well, ROMA goes to ask for help. While she is gone, MANN is able to open the door and decides to come inside and sits on her bed BLA BLA BLA. ROMA comes in and they have a one night stand. However, in that one night- stand ROMA falls in love with him. That morning, they spot the underworld don (MAHESH)who sees it all. The don loves ROMA and couldn't stand what he saw. He orders them to get married, and being frightened, MANN obeys the order and Merry's ROMA. Then, their marriage news ends up in the newspaper. MANN is later finds out that he loves ROMA after they do a music video together. He is now trapped between love and fame. BLA BLA BLA.<br /><br />the movie is horrible.

{"value":"Highly implausible, unbelievable, and incoherent Spanish production about...well, let me see just how close I can get to it. The film opens with a woman having one of her cat's killed by a young girl. She then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation. He calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this. What relevance this plays out to is anybody's guess at the film's end, because the guy, a swarthy photographer, spies a beautiful Patty Shepard, queen of Spanish horror films it seems, taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture, ask her out to lunch, and then to his assignment to Witches Mountain - for reasons again we are never privy to. Before they go, Patty must stop by the house and loud, \"eerie\" chanting echoes in our hero's ears. Again, this is never explained. The film goes on with these two stopping at an inn, going on to the mountain, and finally realizing why the mountain is called Witches Mountain. You know, there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film. It has some atmosphere, some of the character actors are really quite good(especially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman), the leads are at least adequate, and the climax - though it makes absolutely no sense at all - is well-choreographed(literally) with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair. It just doesn't make any sense though, and that is a huge detractor to me. I could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than I did after the first viewing. That is a major problem. The Witches Mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap, atmospheric European horror films that blanketed that decade. If you can get more out of it than me, better power to you.","finished_norm":["highli","implaus","unbeliev","and","incoher","spanish","product","aboutwel","let","me","see","just","how","close","i","can","get","to","it","the","film","open","with","a","woman","have","on","of","her","cat","kill","by","a","young","girl","she","then","beg","her","lover","to","take","her","somewher","on","hi","vacat","he","call","work","and","demand","that","he","lose","hi","vacat","time","and","she","sai","he","will","pai","for","thi","what","relev","thi","plai","out","to","be","anybodi","guess","at","the","film","end","becaus","the","gui","a","swarthi","photograph","spy","a","beauti","patti","shepard","queen","of","spanish","horror","film","it","seem","take","her","bikini","top","off","momentarili","so","he","can","snap","a","pictur","ask","her","out","to","lunch","and","then","to","hi","assign","to","witch","mountain","for","reason","again","we","be","never","privi","to","befor","thei","go","patti","must","stop","by","the","hous","and","loud","eeri","chant","echo","in","our","hero","ear","again","thi","be","never","explain","the","film","go","on","with","thi","two","stop","at","a","inn","go","on","to","the","mountain","and","final","realiz","why","the","mountain","be","call","witch","mountain","you","know","there","be","sever","aspect","to","thi","film","which","make","it","well","than","a","bad","film","it","have","some","atmospher","some","of","the","charact","actor","be","realli","quit","goodespeci","the","deaf","innkeep","and","the","old","woman","the","lead","be","at","littl","adequ","and","the","climax","though","it","make","absolut","no","sens","at","all","be","wellchoreographedliter","with","the","witch","in","white","brassier","and","long","black","hair","it","just","doe","not","make","ani","sens","though","and","that","be","a","huge","detractor","to","me","i","can","watch","the","film","anoth","ten","time","and","still","not","know","much","now","than","i","do","after","the","view","that","be","a","major","problem","the","witch","mountain","be","a","curiou","film","from","the","long","line","of","cheap","atmospher","european","horror","film","that","blanket","that","decad","if","you","can","get","much","out","of","it","than","me","well","power","to","you"],"filtered":["highli","implaus","unbeliev","incoher","spanish","product","aboutwel","let","see","close","get","film","open","woman","cat","kill","young","girl","beg","lover","take","somewher","hi","vacat","call","work","demand","lose","hi","vacat","time","sai","pai","thi","relev","thi","plai","anybodi","guess","film","end","becaus","gui","swarthi","photograph","spy","beauti","patti","shepard","queen","spanish","horror","film","seem","take","bikini","top","momentarili","snap","pictur","ask","lunch","hi","assign","witch","mountain","reason","never","privi","befor","thei","go","patti","must","stop","hous","loud","eeri","chant","echo","hero","ear","thi","never","explain","film","go","thi","two","stop","inn","go","mountain","final","realiz","mountain","call","witch","mountain","know","sever","aspect","thi","film","make","well","bad","film","atmospher","charact","actor","realli","quit","goodespeci","deaf","innkeep","old","woman","lead","littl","adequ","climax","though","make","absolut","sens","wellchoreographedliter","witch","white","brassier","long","black","hair","doe","make","ani","sens","though","huge","detractor","watch","film","anoth","ten","time","still","know","much","view","major","problem","witch","mountain","curiou","film","long","line","cheap","atmospher","european","horror","film","blanket","decad","get","much","well","power"],"filtered2":["highli","implaus","unbeliev","incoher","spanish","product","aboutwel","let","see","close","get","open","woman","cat","kill","young","girl","beg","lover","take","somewher","vacat","call","work","demand","lose","vacat","time","pai","relev","plai","anybodi","guess","end","becaus","gui","swarthi","photograph","spy","beauti","patti","shepard","queen","spanish","horror","seem","take","bikini","top","momentarili","snap","pictur","ask","lunch","assign","witch","mountain","reason","never","privi","befor","go","patti","must","stop","hous","loud","eeri","chant","echo","hero","ear","never","explain","go","two","stop","inn","go","mountain","final","realiz","mountain","call","witch","mountain","know","sever","aspect","make","well","bad","atmospher","charact","actor","realli","quit","goodespeci","deaf","innkeep","old","woman","lead","littl","adequ","climax","though","make","absolut","sens","wellchoreographedliter","witch","white","brassier","long","black","hair","doe","make","ani","sens","though","huge","detractor","watch","anoth","ten","time","still","know","view","major","problem","witch","mountain","curiou","long","line","cheap","atmospher","european","horror","blanket","decad","get","well","power"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,6,7,8,9,10,13,14,18,20,22,24,26,27,31,35,40,41,42,47,48,55,64,67,70,73,76,79,83,84,86,95,99,107,120,124,135,141,142,156,157,167,173,190,213,22

{"value":"\"ASTONISHING\" Screams the LA Times from the front of the DVD box. They must have been referring to the fact that such a sorry piece of crap was ever released. The film revolves around a bunch of girls who have a disease which forces them to become cannibals, and murder innocent people just to stay alive. Their skin peels off throughout the film, we also see severed legs, heads etc that are about as convincing as a Halloween Fuzzy Felt set. There is an awful lot of talking b*ll**ks, a bit of human cuisine and some weird zombie hunter chap who imprisons the sufferers of said skin illness in his closet strapped to a chair, before stabbing them in the head, chopping them into bits...<br /><br />You get the picture. Considering there is no acting talent on display at all, and the gore is laughably unrealistic, what is the point of this whole farrago? Again looking at the video box, the guy responsible for it is an \"underground cult director\". Would that be like those weird religious cults where they brainwash you into thinking one way when clearly the opposite is true? Because that's the only possible reason I can think of for anyone to derive pleasure by watching this tax write-off. Then, on the same paragraph he compares himself to Mike Leigh, Ken Loach and George Romero. HAHAHAHAHA oh stop it. Now you're just being silly.<br /><br />Do you enjoy this film? Are you offended by the above opinion? If so, you must be a member of said cult. Do they pocket your wages? Do they let you see other family members? Do they force you to watch Andrew Parkinson films till you think he's the best director since A.Hitchcock? Do tell... this sounds like a Panorama special brewing to me.

{"value":"As an impressionable 10 year old, I liked the \"love conquers all\" philosophy of the 70s sitcom \"Bridget Loves Bernie.\" I did understand the controversy, which was about the romantic complications between a Jewish cab driver (David Birney) and an Irish Catholic school teacher (Meredith Baxter) and both sets of parents (Harold J. Stone and Bibi Osterwald as Bernie's parents; Audra Lindley and David Doyle as Bridget's parents) who have issues with the young couple's interfaith marriage.<br /><br />Looking at the show now with years of personal life experiences, I am amazed that the show was even a success for one, albeit, highly-rated season. Created by veteran TV writer Bernard Slade, who a few years after the show's cancellation would write the successful play \"Same Time, Next Year\", \"Bridget Loves Bernie\" was a very light, superficial comedy that collapsed under its own airy weight.<br /><br />There was no denying the real-life chemistry between Birney and Baxter. But, in later years, both actors have shown that they are better actors in other projects (Birney in his short-lived role in \"St. Elsewhere\" and Baxter in \"Family\" and \"Family Ties\"). Here, they were trying to breathe life in a show that needed a much gritter comic edge, which might have given the complications more depth to a very controversial subject.<br /><br />The show aired Saturday nights between two CBS powerhouses: \"All in the Family\" and \"Mary Tyler Moore\". Both of those shows were smart, funny and had enough of an edge (more so on the former that the latter) that kept my interest in the situation and the characters. \"Bridget Loves Bernie\" was not very smart and only had some occasional chuckles.<br /><br />This was another example of a show that really was not as good as I
