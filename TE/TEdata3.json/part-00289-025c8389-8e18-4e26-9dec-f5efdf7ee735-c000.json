{"value":"Cast to die for in a movie that is considerably less. Vanessa Redgrave is dying but before she goes she begins to tell her daughters the story of her life and of her secret love...<br /><br />This is one of those movies which has the look and expectations of being a great film simply because they have so many great actors and actresses in it so it seems to be about something other than the potboiler that it really is. Not bad as such but with Redgrave, Toni Collette, Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Clare Danes,Natasha Richardson,Eileen Atkins, Patrick Wilson,Hugh Darcy and others (all giving fine performances) you expect more than a weepy story thats a bit more than a harlequin romance.<br /><br />Wait for Cable.","finished_norm":["cast","to","die","for","in","a","movi","that","be","consider","littl","vanessa","redgrav","be","dye","but","befor","she","go","she","begin","to","tell","her","daughter","the","stori","of","her","life","and","of","her","secret","lovebr","br","thi","be","on","of","that","movi","which","have","the","look","and","expect","of","be","a","great","film","simpli","becaus","thei","have","so","mani","great","actor","and","actress","in","it","so","it","seem","to","be","about","someth","other","than","the","potboil","that","it","realli","be","not","bad","a","such","but","with","redgrav","toni","collett","glenn","close","meryl","streep","clare","danesnatasha","richardsoneileen","atkin","patrick","wilsonhugh","darci","and","other","all","give","fine","perform","you","expect","much","than","a","weepi","stori","that","a","bite","much","than","a","harlequin","romancebr","br","wait","for","cabl"],"filtered":["cast","die","movi","consider","littl","vanessa","redgrav","dye","befor","go","begin","tell","daughter","stori","life","secret","lovebr","br","thi","movi","look","expect","great","film","simpli","becaus","thei","mani","great","actor","actress","seem","someth","potboil","realli","bad","redgrav","toni","collett","glenn","close","meryl","streep","clare","danesnatasha","richardsoneileen","atkin","patrick","wilsonhugh","darci","give","fine","perform","expect","much","weepi","stori","bite","much","harlequin","romancebr","br","wait","cabl"],"filtered2":["cast","die","consider","littl","vanessa","redgrav","dye","befor","go","begin","tell","daughter","stori","life","secret","lovebr","look","expect","great","simpli","becaus","mani","great","actor","actress","seem","someth","potboil","realli","bad","redgrav","toni","collett","glenn","close","meryl","streep","clare","danesnatasha","richardsoneileen","atkin","patrick","wilsonhugh","darci","give","fine","perform","expect","weepi","stori","bite","harlequin","romancebr","wait","cabl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,9,13,14,16,17,22,30,35,41,50,51,53,75,79,90,92,105,130,147,154,201,293,295,331,355,426,464,798,1230,1456,1533,1981,2506,3376,3877,3988,4164,6746,7220,7252,7297],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,9,13,14,16,17,22,30,35,41,50,51,53,75,79,90,92,105,130,147,154,201,293,295,331,355,426,464,798,1230,1456,1533,1981,2506,3376,3877,3988,4164,6746,7220,7252,7297],"values":[0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,1.2979240167361772,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.5687599167621034,1.717994385570355,3.4279798616619646,1.7003182735607676,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,2.0477128419653545,2.0489535369135887,2.1765612129984904,4.528427806839927,2.2844323215331563,2.348499626138016,2.561435818751577,2.9012296278682137,2.7910771187233068,2.932274249550174,3.0316467233633775,3.3909310864081816,3.2872346624216657,3.9282323841582003,4.390138803171316,4.8085911068062925,4.558366596889411,4.838444069955973,5.339219357868463,5.850044981634453,6.137727054086234,6.0662680901040895,6.0662680901040895,13.589013180950609,6.725513718988353,7.0356686472921925,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.614842553485936E-4,2.612525409305093E-4,2.613170462009934E-4,2.6126451311592587E-4,2.612892387030442E-4,2.6125110046281385E-4,2.6133235318208836E-4,2.6121223056003475E-4,2.612525961435631E-4,2.615225723922476E-4,2.635976778853438E-4,2.612530276652938E-4,2.615004507919948E-4,2.615276946273664E-4,2.6140888942435543E-4,2.6126554219902895E-4,2.613554276499348E-4,2.6147842240272444E-4,2.612790302124765E-4,2.6127807495041885E-4,2.615131342971647E-4,2.6130425234607987E-4,2.613046478074204E-4,2.614720423625508E-4,2.6127912446240176E-4,2.6153082052883026E-4,2.613445085516981E-4,2.612519554093563E-4,2.613703958813557E-4,2.6145016989374874E-4,2.613055340857288E-4,2.614454836394505E-4,2.61573846844978E-4,2.6181662793414365E-4,2.613440569410399E-4,2.612653837373359E-4,2.613595846628696E-4,2.6129191767686465E-4,2.612125093556708E-4,2.6127894929861274E-4,2.615407954557391E-4,2.613973238661975E-4,2.614460794286617E-4,2.612255098731045E-4,2.612790157352306E-4,2.612652854915763E-4,2.613537214219082E-4,2.613990404838678E-4,2.613458864660953E-4,2.6130446268135776E-4,2.6126593158055147E-4,2.6180122304543036E-4,2.613316736148886E-4,2.6127895585041194E-4,2.6133027408698466E-4,2.6125222270562175E-4,0.979351423393872,2.612929824151943E-4,2.612662983644796E-4,2.612520735761906E-4,2.6146108150200154E-4,2.6135612446964143E-4,2.6125196436596414E-4,2.612254034439248E-4,2.611991343440664E-4,2.61435299708924E-4,2.6126476291089606E-4,2.6138352415462326E-4,2.614602335926062E-4,2.6134161417251065E-4,2.6127930190573365E-4,2.612257458930215E-4,2.612925722653011E-4,2.612256051935994E-4,2.61239313890894E-4,2.6122

{"value":"Where to start, this movie started badly and ended badly! It consists of extremely poor acting and unrealistic effects that had me cringing in my seat, seriously, my cat could have acted better than this lot.<br /><br />Some of it was actually laughable because it was so unbelievable, i would of rated this lower but they haven't got anything else! So, heed my warning and unless your so bored your close to suicide and would like a good reason to continue with your suicide mission, don't bother with this one. I'm still in shock that this could actually be released to the public, this should be a crime and all involved should be arrested.

{"value":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen with Robert De Niro, The Fan is a pointless cliché of an exercise in slasher flicks. It tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing. (spoiler) We're to believe that a knife-wielding idiot has access to and murders a baseball player in a lavish hotel with no witness, security, or cameras? The movie is nonsense trying to tug at our heart-strings through the hoopla of baseball ending up mockingly unsophisticated and gimmicky.

{"value":"Some of the worst, least natural acting performances I've ever seen. Which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky, lame dialog given to the one note characters. Add to that the cheap production values and you've got a movie that doesn't look like it even belongs on television. One doesn't expect much from a Lifetime movie, especially one this old, but this is nearly unwatchably bad.<br /><br />Plot-wise, it's a dreadful, clichéd romance of a type even Harlequin would consider beneath them. It's possible to guess how the remainder of the movie will go by simply watching the opening couple of scenes.

{"value":"Okay, first off, Seagal's voice is dubbed over for like 50% of the film... Why? Because apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions. From the very beginning, you just scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting, but they make no sense.<br /><br />That said, the story still sucked and doesn't make any sense at all. When I got the the end, I was just scratching my head cause the movie was so pointless and the ending didn't even make sense.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague. This movie made me stop watching Seagal straight to video movies cause they just get worse and worse.","finished_norm":["okai","off","seagal","voic","be","dub","over","for","like","of","the","film","why","becaus","appar","there","be","rewrit","the","script","and","stori","a","thei","be","shoot","and","thei","ne","to","chang","hi","dialogu","for","stori","continu","a","thei","have","multipl","version","from","the","veri","begin","you","just","scratch","your","head","becaus","the","overdub","be","not","onli","distract","but","thei","make","no","sensebr","br","that","sai","the","stori","still","suck","and","doe","not","make","ani","sens","at","all","when","i","get","the","the","end","i","be","just","scratch","my","head","caus","the","movi","be","so","pointless","and","the","end","do","not","even","make","sensebr","br","avoid","like","the","plagu","thi","movi","make","me","stop","watch","seagal","straight","to","video","movi","caus","thei","just","get","wrong","and","wrong"],"filtered":["okai","seagal","voic","dub","like","film","becaus","appar","rewrit","script","stori","thei","shoot","thei","ne","chang","hi","dialogu","stori","continu","thei","multipl","version","veri","begin","scratch","head","becaus","overdub","onli","distract","thei","make","sensebr","br","sai","stori","still","suck","doe","make","ani","sens","get","end","scratch","head","caus","movi","pointless","end","even","make","sensebr","br","avoid","like","plagu","thi","movi","make","stop","watch","seagal","straight","video","movi","caus","thei","get","wrong","wrong"],"filtered2":["okai","seagal","voic","dub","like","becaus","appar","rewrit","script","stori","shoot","ne","chang","dialogu","stori","continu","multipl","version","veri","begin","scratch","head","becaus","overdub","onli","distract","make","sensebr","stori","still","suck","doe","make","ani","sens","get","end","scratch","head","caus","pointless","end","even","make","sensebr","avoid","like","plagu","make","stop","watch","seagal","straight","video","caus","get","wrong","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,7,11,15,17,18,22,24,25,27,64,77,110,117,147,173,191,208,220,240,248,278,308,315,335,421,428,433,452,531,548,949,1356,1402,1923,2127,2449,2494,3844],"values":[4.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,7,11,15,17,18,22,24,25,27,64,77,110,117,147,173,191,208,220,240,248,278,308,315,335,421,428,433,452,531,548,949,1356,1402,1923,2127,2449,2494,3844],"values":[2.479906862482093,1.2920765891153156,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,3.83116108203179,1.2153159934048174,2.5958480334723544,2.6420723132238515,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.883428577602134,1.9463902258768238,2.1290479736304078,2.2797301185117202,2.2844323215331563,2.4368824319140248,2.5460113484259455,5.257898800055879,2.8336934208777267,2.7666071276613566,2.689504733779216,2.8336934208777267,2.8753661172782943,2.854312708080462,2.908534262247101,3.2597778161886266,3.3721070011625462,3.164467636384302,6.5744693248433315,3.4272107604888307,3.459754308221302,4.086456389373095,4.396611317676934,11.16683263676101,4.8184434032493035,5.00274712124725,5.1994574154933035,10.313795602149016,11.591955520728355]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612978E-4,2.116930065387443E-4,2.117452751773487E-4,2.117027076039154E-4,2.1172274275403055E-4,2.116918393273703E-4,2.11757678428385E-4,2.1166034303434332E-4,2.1169305127789712E-4,2.11911813107254E-4,2.1359327166514585E-4,2.116934009400755E-4,2.1189388796841974E-4,2.119159636557946E-4,2.1181969576676945E-4,2.117035414702399E-4,2.1177637567609513E-4,2.1187603835847056E-4,2.1171447081128584E-4,2.1171369676217493E-4,2.1190416541618472E-4,2.1173490831315583E-4,2.1173522875559002E-4,2.1187086861014436E-4,2.1171454718202647E-4,2.119184965746197E-4,2.1176752792775866E-4,2.1169253209079127E-4,2.1178850443817637E-4,2.1185314534259396E-4,2.1173594690714967E-4,2.1184934806943345E-4,2.1195336081055466E-4,2.1215008639459363E-4,2.117671619875168E-4,2.1170341306868596E-4,2.117797441048318E-4,2.1172491352726197E-4,2.1166056894252475E-4,2.117144052467595E-4,2.1192657926066675E-4,2.118103241917791E-4,2.118498308375969E-4,2.1167110326541515E-4,2.1171445908036945E-4,2.117033334601196E-4,2.117749931190509E-4,2.1181171516755455E-4,2.1176864445217778E-4,2.1173507874789E-4,2.117038569861958E-4,2.1213760380898701E-4,2.117571277748941E-4,2.1171441055568423E-4,2.1175599373704447E-4,2.1169274868102945E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.117257762850265E-4,2.1170415419131475E-4,2.1169262784140997E-4,2.118619870217944E-4,2.1177694030929714E-4,2.1169253934833312E-4,2.1167101702582124E-4,2.1164973116690372E-4,2.1184109602769688E-4,2.1170291001284915E-4,2.1179914228165446E-4,2.1186129996057562E-4,2.117651826114985E-4,2.117146909644076E-4,2.1167129451241952E-4,2.11725443940454E-4,2.1167118050363867E-4,2.116822886648672E-4,2.1167130050324474E-4,2.1180870475

{"value":"Where to begin? the special effects should be named special defects, When the director shouted \"action\" I guess he also indicated to the actors to carry out the worst performance they could think of. Maybe he was annoyed with the producers and wanted to make sure that they would not recover a single cent out of their investment and that the work would be a case study of how not to make movie.

Everything from the tacky, and I DO mean tacky score to the really bad acting, I dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds.<br /><br />I mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of Damion, but without him around in this one it's just not the same. Sure by the end of part 3 I was getting a little tired of the continued story line's, but it was a good closure at the end of the third one. Again there was no reason for a part 4. Even if there was they could have done a MUCH better job than this sh*t I had to sit through, lol. There goes an hour and a half of my life i'll never see again.","finished_norm":["good","sinc","see","part","through","i","can","honestli","sai","that","thei","should","have","never","make","part","everyth","from","the","tacki","and","i","do","mean","tacki","score","to","the","realli","bad","act","i","dare","anyon","to","watch","thi","and","not","be","bore","out","of","their","mindsbr","br","i","mean","part","to","keep","the","vibe","strong","on","the","plot","of","damion","but","without","him","around","in","thi","on","it","just","not","the","same","sure","by","the","end","of","part","i","be","get","a","littl","tire","of","the","continu","stori","line","but","it","be","a","good","closur","at","the","end","of","the","on","again","there","be","no","reason","for","a","part","even","if","there","be","thei","can","have","do","a","much","well","job","than","thi","sht","i","have","to","sit","through","lol","there","go","a","hour","and","a","half","of","my","life","i","will","never","see","again"],"filtered":["good","sinc","see","part","honestli","sai","thei","never","make","part","everyth","tacki","mean","tacki","score","realli","bad","act","dare","anyon","watch","thi","bore","mindsbr","br","mean","part","keep","vibe","strong","plot","damion","without","around","thi","sure","end","part","get","littl","tire","continu","stori","line","good","closur","end","reason","part","even","thei","much","well","job","thi","sht","sit","lol","go","hour","half","life","never","see"],"filtered2":["good","sinc","see","part","honestli","never","make","part","everyth","tacki","mean","tacki","score","realli","bad","act","dare","anyon","watch","bore","mindsbr","mean","part","keep","vibe","strong","plot","damion","without","around","sure","end","part","get","littl","tire","continu","stori","line","good","closur","end","reason","part","even","well","job","sht","sit","lol","go","hour","half","life","never","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,13,14,17,20,21,24,32,42,61,75,88,95,98,107,108,119,125,134,158,162,174,193,206,244,289,433,518,631,757,900,1741,3034,3094,4011,6121,6998],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,13,14,17,20,21,24,32,42,61,75,88,95,98,107,108,119,125,134,158,162,174,193,206,244,289,433,518,631,757,900,1741,3034,3094,4011,6121,6998],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.3114004109387893,1.357228929984541,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,2.6420723132238515,1.3711311285073675,3.2439908614907673,9.409258523696263,1.9742250248702675,4.063444682693467,2.0323326556775485,2.0881990796736947,2.1439533986393955,2.138507503627933,2.1653408989309972,2.2242236634876535,2.2443961816702407,2.3106972614914807,2.3586007221245198,2.456282578459816,2.517840471459249,2.597304642813496,2.634508058031767,2.8282659991423613,3.164467636384302,3.4101163271295305,3.607563812710113,3.7165362186843414,3.9201351739255808,4.751432692966343,10.926544013076883,5.501738287366237,5.822646007446338,6.437831646536572,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.234407602816466E-4,2.2324275812784212E-4,2.2329787848933362E-4,2.232529884731E-4,2.2327411672029316E-4,2.232415272346222E-4,2.23310958448924E-4,2.2320831253640848E-4,2.2324280530791688E-4,2.2347350255652807E-4,2.252466997550512E-4,2.2324317404730224E-4,2.2345459944065E-4,2.2347787955470622E-4,2.233763593891773E-4,2.232538678343091E-4,2.2333067579914003E-4,2.2343577597443485E-4,2.232653934689038E-4,2.2326457718847365E-4,2.234654376153402E-4,2.232869460197476E-4,2.2328728394518973E-4,2.2343032416998444E-4,2.232654740063531E-4,2.234805506669639E-4,2.233213453268011E-4,2.2324225779449925E-4,2.2334346629394172E-4,2.2341163393927875E-4,2.2328804127835604E-4,2.234076294908202E-4,2.2351731705956893E-4,2.2372477578809868E-4,2.2332095942123793E-4,2.2325373242729915E-4,2.2333422800586628E-4,2.2327640592866794E-4,2.2320855076990673E-4,2.232653243272447E-4,2.2348907433600583E-4,2.2336647651074383E-4,2.2340813859831555E-4,2.2321965983456367E-4,2.2326538109796075E-4,2.232536484753717E-4,2.2332921781121275E-4,2.233679433767196E-4,2.2332252276763826E-4,2.2328712575322467E-4,2.2325420056448943E-4,2.2371161216552582E-4,2.233103777523479E-4,2.2326532992581887E-4,2.2330918184256557E-4,2.2324248620167692E-4,0.9823555967090396,2.232773157576042E-4,2.2325451398481238E-4,2.232423587691727E-4,2.2342095801135587E-4,2.2333127123814583E-4,2.2324226544800506E-4,2.2321956888982666E-4,2.2319712169645186E-4,2.2339892722621744E-4,2.2325320192525595E-4,2.2335468452716262E-4,2.2342023346478727E-4,2.2331887205251035E-4,2.232656256333523E-4,2.232198615158069E-4,2.2327696528065538E-4,2.2321974128682484E-4,2.2323145549784637E-4,2.2321986783348534E-4,2.2336476872051287E-4,2.2329828821719062E-4,

{"value":"I don't know how this movie received so many positive reviews on this site! I'm a big vonnegut fan and am very familiar with the story this Showtime original film bastardized beyond belief, but even if I wasn't, the poor acting, VERY poor casting (Sean Astin as the brilliant, athletic, and all around individual, Harrison?? The guy's completely generic!) and sub-standard writing rendered this tripe barely watchable. Someone pointed out how cute that Maculay Culkin line was. If you read that and thought that was pure comic brilliance (sadly, it probably was the most INTENTIONALLY funny part of the movie), maybe you'll like this movie.

{"value":"The plot of 'Edison' was decent, but one actor in particular ruined the entire film. Justin Timberlake ruined the film with every line he uttered during the movie. He is by far one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and should face the same fate as the entire F.R.A.T. squad. <br /><br />Whether it was an emotional scene, an action scene, or even a silent scene, Justin Timberlake managed to ruin it. <br /><br />Do not waste your time watching this film. Don't even bother downloading it, midget porn would be a much better choice.<br /><br />And Justin, if you're reading this, stick to music. Even though you're no good at that, you've done a wonderful job tricking people into thinking you can actually

{"value":"This movie was absolutly awful. I can't think of one thing good about it. The plot holes were so huge you could drive a Hummer through them. The acting was soo stuningly bad that even Jean Claude should be ashamed, and that is saying alot!!! And dialogue, What dialogue???To think that I was a fan of the first one (I use that comment loosely, its more like a guilty pleasure, than anything else). This movie had Goldberg in it for crying out loud!!!! Nothing good can come of this movie. What makes this film even worse is that it is soo bad you can't even watch it with a bunch of friends to make fun of!!! This has got to be in my top five worst movies of all time. 2/10 because it is soo hard for me to give a

{"value":"I actually have a fondness for Christopher Lee, but this just wasn't up to his other performances... and he was one of the better actors.<br /><br />The film does not live up to its premise. It's not that scary, it's overly melodramatic, and it draaaaaags. Every time I thought, \"Oh, HERE comes the good part\" the good part never quite arrived.<br /><br />The Evil Ones aren't at all convincing. Most of the other characters were also lacking in depth.<br /><br />Perhaps if I'd been in the proper frame of mind, I might have enjoyed some MSTie-fication at this film's expense, but....

{"value":"This film is a good example of how through media manipulation you can sell a film that is no more than a very unfunny TV sitcom. In Puerto Rico the daily newspaper with the widest circulation has continuously written about the marvels of this film, almost silencing all others. Coincidentally the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners. The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the film's form and content, and pointed out all its flaws, clichés, and bad writing.<br /><br />Just because a film makes a portion of the audience laugh with easy and obvious jokes, and because one can recognize actors and scenery, does not make it an acceptable film.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","a","good","exampl","of","how","through","medium","manipul","you","can","sell","a","film","that","be","no","much","than","a","veri","unfunni","tv","sitcom","in","puerto","rico","the","daili","newspap","with","the","wide","circul","have","continu","write","about","the","marvel","of","thi","film","almost","silenc","all","other","coincident","the","newspap","with","the","larg","circul","belong","to","the","same","owner","the","weekli","claridad","be","the","onli","newspap","on","the","island","that","have","analyz","the","film","form","and","content","and","point","out","all","it","flaw","cliché","and","bad","writingbr","br","just","becaus","a","film","make","a","portion","of","the","audienc","laugh","with","easi","and","obviou","joke","and","becaus","on","can","recogn","actor","and","sceneri","doe","not","make","it","a","accept","film"],"filtered":["thi","film","good","exampl","medium","manipul","sell","film","much","veri","unfunni","tv","sitcom","puerto","rico","daili","newspap","wide","circul","continu","write","marvel","thi","film","almost","silenc","coincident","newspap","larg","circul","belong","owner","weekli","claridad","onli","newspap","island","analyz","film","form","content","point","flaw","cliché","bad","writingbr","br","becaus","film","make","portion","audienc","laugh","easi","obviou","joke","becaus","recogn","actor","sceneri","doe","make","accept","film"],"filtered2":["good","exampl","medium","manipul","sell","veri","unfunni","tv","sitcom","puerto","rico","daili","newspap","wide","circul","continu","write","marvel","almost","silenc","coincident","newspap","larg","circul","belong","owner","weekli","claridad","onli","newspap","island","analyz","form","content","point","flaw","cliché","bad","writingbr","becaus","make","portion","audienc","laugh","easi","obviou","joke","becaus","recogn","actor","sceneri","doe","make","accept"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,9,11,15,18,22,41,65,66,131,133,168,172,214,307,383,433,523,564,689,719,741,744,861,923,948,1138,1142,1245,1540,1568,1582,1774,1797,1882,2415,2751,2796,2824,2854,3457,5544,5567,5795,6399,8484],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,9,11,15,18,22,41,65,66,131,133,168,172,214,307,383,433,523,564,689,719,741,744,861,923,948,1138,1142,1245,1540,1568,1582,1774,1797,1882,2415,2751,2796,2824,2854,3457,5544,5567,5795,6399,8484],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6786144649922705,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,2.5958480334723544,1.5687599167621034,1.9073850067444174,1.929723173391612,2.2512118082053005,2.3212364753796515,2.4894767118610357,2.5001408943598484,2.7303758068497004,2.8767855639325206,3.0433232530252132,3.164467636384302,3.4986697244709752,3.469984576472117,3.607563812710113,4.072271754381138,3.7165362186843414,3.700222643192818,3.892300374932137,3.9911462095687695,4.049068857301474,4.224077767249142,4.263079925052412,4.409683399244287,4.528289141652134,4.597282013139085,4.621379564718146,4.828393734102471,4.8085911068062925,5.00274712124725,5.170884043049248,5.3560264761848435,5.390512652256013,16.171537956768038,5.373120909544144,6.725513718988353,6.2980697041614135,7.0356686472921925,6.342521466732247,6.489124940924123,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918362E-4,2.3612552253122077E-4,2.3618382374676047E-4,2.361363432433458E-4,2.361586907472491E-4,2.3612422060632443E-4,2.3619765851711928E-4,2.3608908917345197E-4,2.361255724339361E-4,2.3636958262639052E-4,2.3824510646673118E-4,2.3612596245232135E-4,2.3634958866039756E-4,2.3637421220985654E-4,2.3626683357713403E-4,2.3613727335022465E-4,2.3621851370481602E-4,2.363296789404444E-4,2.3614946409949688E-4,2.3614860071362616E-4,2.363610522782254E-4,2.3617226039252134E-4,2.361726178187701E-4,2.3632391252640533E-4,2.3614954928455486E-4,2.3637703746512068E-4,2.3620864479495765E-4,2.3612499332492976E-4,2.3623204230611896E-4,2.363041437306396E-4,2.361734188556822E-4,2.3629990819577765E-4,2.364159255515171E-4,2.366353561887685E-4,2.3620823661977871E-4,2.36137130129225E-4,2.3622227090024046E-4,2.3616111205994122E-4,2.360893411547916E-4,2.3614939096785076E-4,2.363860530131424E-4,2.3625638038324864E-4,2.3630044668255487E-4,2.3610109129494823E-4,2.3614945101465857E-4,2.3613704133264814E-4,2.3621697158016184E-4,2.3625793189828057E-4,2.3620989018287194E-4,2.3617245049795428E-4,2.361376252814064E-4,2.3662143292745204E-4,2.361970443100399E-4,2.3614939688950423E-4,2.361957793873852E-4,2.361252349128972E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.3616207439276129E-4,2.361379567884087E-4,2.3612510012659146E-4,2.3631400587089348E-4,2.3621914350507273E-4,2.3612500142009967E-4,2.3610099510202475E-4,2.3607725253895382E-4,2.3629070374590538E-4,2.361365690132757E-4,2.3624390791467608E-4,2.363132395126

{"value":"The problem I find with this title is that I am not sure if the director is trying to produce a documentary or movie. A blend of the two genres just doesn't work and that leaves the whole thing hung in the middle of nowhere. This is more so as the director has picked the most extremes of what is supposed to be happening around our everyday life making it an unconvincing documentary. If it is meant to be a thriller/drama this is too dull and monotonous. In either case, what is the moral or the message which the director is trying to convey to the audience?

{"value":"The story by Norman Maclean is a masterwork; Redford's film is a mediocrity. He adds banal scenes of the Maclean brothers going over a falls and of them double-dating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story. The cipher, Brad Pitt, trying to play the charismatic Paul Maclean, a genius outdoors, proves either risible or depressing, depending on what the original story meant to you. Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful. Also, Tom Skerritt as the father and Craig Sheffer as Norman are strong and masculine, as men were once expected to be. None of the women make an impression in the film, which is regrettable, because Maclean loved the women in his story and made this clear, even poetic.","finished_norm":["the","stori","by","norman","maclean","be","a","masterwork","redford","film","be","a","mediocr","he","add","banal","scene","of","the","maclean","brother","go","over","a","fall","and","of","them","doubled","in","a","seedi","bar","that","be","not","even","hint","at","in","the","stori","the","cipher","brad","pitt","try","to","plai","the","charismat","paul","maclean","a","geniu","outdoor","prove","either","risibl","or","depress","depend","on","what","the","origin","stori","mean","to","you","some","of","the","fly","cast","scene","be","beauti","conjur","tom","skerritt","a","the","father","and","craig","sheffer","a","norman","be","strong","and","masculin","a","man","be","onc","expect","to","be","none","of","the","woman","make","a","impress","in","the","film","which","be","regrett","becaus","maclean","love","the","woman","in","hi","stori","and","make","thi","clear","even","poetic"],"filtered":["stori","norman","maclean","masterwork","redford","film","mediocr","add","banal","scene","maclean","brother","go","fall","doubled","seedi","bar","even","hint","stori","cipher","brad","pitt","try","plai","charismat","paul","maclean","geniu","outdoor","prove","either","risibl","depress","depend","origin","stori","mean","fly","cast","scene","beauti","conjur","tom","skerritt","father","craig","sheffer","norman","strong","masculin","man","onc","expect","none","woman","make","impress","film","regrett","becaus","maclean","love","woman","hi","stori","make","thi","clear","even","poetic"],"filtered2":["stori","norman","maclean","masterwork","redford","mediocr","add","banal","scene","maclean","brother","go","fall","doubled","seedi","bar","even","hint","stori","cipher","brad","pitt","try","plai","charismat","paul","maclean","geniu","outdoor","prove","either","risibl","depress","depend","origin","stori","mean","fly","cast","scene","beauti","conjur","tom","skerritt","father","craig","sheffer","norman","strong","masculin","man","onc","expect","none","woman","make","impress","regrett","becaus","maclean","love","woman","stori","make","clear","even","poetic"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,17,19,22,36,39,40,45,54,69,70,88,92,130,169,207,236,299,325,343,370,381,418,540,590,631,652,759,787,840,1070,1075,1303,1341,1969,2675,3062,3465,3587,4135,4159,4473,4627,5869,6532,7334,8178],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,6,17,19,22,36,39,40,45,54,69,70,88,92,130,169,207,236,299,325,343,370,381,418,540,590,631,652,759,787,840,1070,1075,1303,1341,1969,2675,3062,3465,3587,4135,4159,4473,4627,5869,6532,7334,8178],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.852034211452262,0.9708269144703846,5.108214776042387,2.62476135602347,1.2979240167361772,1.4680183469605717,1.5538940054862738,1.6284968758320737,1.8162961064622165,1.8113893252729412,2.127032521151058,4.189351572503368,2.0317223413467334,2.0489535369135887,2.2642139034199635,2.4071371113909277,2.5531798379045583,2.617923930016232,2.7949961309240425,2.973659465713028,3.112795625839981,2.9958122703541616,3.24941502915308,3.164467636384302,3.432149042129413,3.4986697244709752,3.607563812710113,3.7810747398219124,3.969732115064953,3.760240652919071,4.049068857301474,4.176068548062782,4.202455303235976,4.370968887063596,4.449957298382227,4.869215728622727,5.243909178064138,5.604922523601468,5.649374286172302,5.967828017290836,6.0662680901040895,12.350934764138163,6.101359409915359,5.999576715605417,6.389041482367141,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479613E-4,2.116930065387445E-4,2.1174527517734892E-4,2.117027076039156E-4,2.1172274275403074E-4,2.1169183932737048E-4,2.117576784283852E-4,2.1166034303434354E-4,2.1169305127789734E-4,2.119118131072542E-4,2.1359327166514607E-4,2.1169340094007573E-4,2.1189388796841996E-4,2.1191596365579483E-4,2.1181969576676964E-4,2.1170354147024008E-4,2.1177637567609535E-4,2.1187603835847078E-4,2.1171447081128603E-4,2.1171369676217515E-4,2.119041654161849E-4,2.1173490831315604E-4,2.1173522875559024E-4,2.1187086861014457E-4,2.1171454718202666E-4,2.1191849657461992E-4,2.1176752792775888E-4,2.116925320907915E-4,2.1178850443817659E-4,2.1185314534259415E-4,2.1173594690714986E-4,2.1184934806943364E-4,2.1195336081055488E-4,2.1215008639459385E-4,2.11767161987517E-4,2.1170341306868615E-4,2.11779744104832E-4,2.1172491352726216E-4,2.1166056894252494E-4,2.117144052467597E-4,2.1192657926066697E-4,2.1181032419177932E-4,2.1184983083759708E-4,2.1167110326541534E-4,2.1171445908036967E-4,2.117033334601198E-4,2.117749931190511E-4,2.1181171516755474E-4,2.11768644452178E-4,2.1173507874789019E-4,2.1170385698619603E-4,2.1213760380898723E-4,2.1175712777489432E-4,2.1171441055568442E-4,2.117559937370447E-4,2.1169274868102967E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502672E-4,2.1170415419131494E

{"value":"There are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of, let's say, little monsters or scary looking dolls. Which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie, really.<br /><br />Dr. Feinstone (Corbin Bernsen) has been a successful dentist for several years now, but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps, and he brings his anger and frustration to his work. Well, give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth, and you can probably guess what happens next...<br /><br />As I said, brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should.

{"value":"Director Fred Schepisi(Roxanne) directs this well intentioned, but inferior comedy about Albert Einstein(Matthau) trying to hook his scientific niece(Ryan) up with ordinary guy Tim Robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950's. To get Ryan to like Robbins, Einstein tries to make Robbins look like a brilliant scientist. The idea is cute, but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue. Tim Robbins, Meg Ryan, and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat, but are unable to rescue the film. Its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie. I would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of Meg Ryan.","finished_norm":["director","fred","schepisiroxann","direct","thi","good","intent","but","inferior","comedi","about","albert","einsteinmatthau","try","to","hook","hi","scientif","nieceryan","up","with","ordinari","gui","tim","robbin","in","order","to","get","her","to","relax","and","enjoi","life","in","the","to","get","ryan","to","like","robbin","einstein","try","to","make","robbin","look","like","a","brilliant","scientist","the","idea","be","cute","but","the","film","fall","flat","with","corni","situat","and","silli","dialogu","tim","robbin","meg","ryan","and","the","terrif","support","cast","do","their","well","to","keep","thi","silli","comedi","afloat","but","be","unabl","to","rescu","the","film","it","unfortun","that","so","much","talent","go","into","produc","such","a","lacklust","movi","i","would","not","recommend","to","anybodi","unless","thei","be","huge","fan","of","meg","ryan"],"filtered":["director","fred","schepisiroxann","direct","thi","good","intent","inferior","comedi","albert","einsteinmatthau","try","hook","hi","scientif","nieceryan","ordinari","gui","tim","robbin","order","get","relax","enjoi","life","get","ryan","like","robbin","einstein","try","make","robbin","look","like","brilliant","scientist","idea","cute","film","fall","flat","corni","situat","silli","dialogu","tim","robbin","meg","ryan","terrif","support","cast","well","keep","thi","silli","comedi","afloat","unabl","rescu","film","unfortun","much","talent","go","produc","lacklust","movi","recommend","anybodi","unless","thei","huge","fan","meg","ryan"],"filtered2":["director","fred","schepisiroxann","direct","good","intent","inferior","comedi","albert","einsteinmatthau","try","hook","scientif","nieceryan","ordinari","gui","tim","robbin","order","get","relax","enjoi","life","get","ryan","like","robbin","einstein","try","make","robbin","look","like","brilliant","scientist","idea","cute","fall","flat","corni","situat","silli","dialogu","tim","robbin","meg","ryan","terrif","support","cast","well","keep","silli","comedi","afloat","unabl","rescu","unfortun","talent","go","produc","lacklust","recommend","anybodi","unless","huge","fan","meg","ryan"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,16,20,36,55,58,75,92,102,123,127,134,140,169,200,227,248,261,276,298,385,439,444,459,460,473,593,805,811,855,912,1190,1209,1444,1485,1496,1502,1957,1971,2229,2359,2366,2741,2963,3127,3401,3684,4535,7382],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,6,16,20,36,55,58,75,92,102,123,127,134,140,169,200,227,248,261,276,298,385,439,444,459,460,473,593,805,811,855,912,1190,1209,1444,1485,1496,1502,1957,1971,2229,2359,2366,2741,2963,3127,3401,3684,4535,7382],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,2.9360366939211433,1.9536997889255368,1.865701314626681,1.9742250248702675,2.0489535369135887,2.087553710177271,2.2619070973220485,4.871935874217273,2.2443961816702407,2.317169775997098,2.4071371113909277,2.5308211829319704,2.6005321873043625,2.689504733779216,2.7085302779237206,2.7884729505849193,2.7819920465008363,6.18993968377476,3.2872346624216657,3.2535472664379905,3.2850956241729166,3.216957819005698,3.335489637924323,3.490764544963862,4.096025840389245,3.8425769395797067,3.9201351739255808,3.9405024767500145,4.383707912841026,4.3095999406873045,9.597669863721855,4.566029469634981,4.9676558014359795,4.520909034354511,4.911775343041523,4.9227044135737135,15.34822741966276,5.129498826886393,5.5623629091826725,5.259176650194926,5.482320201509136,5.463272006538442,24.265072360416358,5.672363804397,12.596139408322827,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8619294647691638E-4,1.860279514939994E-4,1.8607388323225538E-4,1.8603647642975705E-4,1.8605408257553737E-4,1.860269257919962E-4,1.860847827485874E-4,1.8599924801951208E-4,1.860279908091052E-4,1.8622023057954321E-4,1.876978339078772E-4,1.8602829807924052E-4,1.8620447863330701E-4,1.86223877927442E-4,1.8613928128212613E-4,1.8603720920051174E-4,1.8610121319542628E-4,1.8618879305904972E-4,1.860468134994879E-4,1.860461332938788E-4,1.862135100726803E-4,1.8606477321704633E-4,1.860650548099557E-4,1.8618425007623423E-4,1.8604688061125822E-4,1.8622610376242842E-4,1.8609343812280919E-4,1.8602753456676012E-4,1.861118715010596E-4,1.861686755269844E-4,1.860656858948729E-4,1.8616533862436836E-4,1.8625674115804874E-4,1.8642961629456646E-4,1.860931165481163E-4,1.8603709636599522E-4,1.8610417324549066E-4,1.860559901704268E-4,1.8599944653923127E-4,1.8604675588381733E-4,1.8623320652672132E-4,1.861310458901015E-4,1.8616576286309953E-4,1.86008703710924E-4,1.860468031907943E-4,1.8603702640894391E-4,1.8609999825564642E-4,1.8613226822794966E-4,1.86094419282999E-4,1.860649

But this is my 2 cents worth, I suggest borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself. Cause i sure wouldn't waste the money on it myself again. Now i leave you with this comment. I hope your not made at the rental place when they wont refund you your money ..

I have no idea why they even made another movie it was stupid and pointless sorry to say that i have all of them. I have sat through them number of times and it still drives me to turn it off 5 minutes into the movie. I like Terence Hill movies and i like Bud Spencer but this movie just drove me up the wall. If it had a different story line or at least more of a plot and more comedy it might have been funner and worth the 5 dollars i spent buying all the movies.

{"value":"I guess that \"Gunslinger\" wasn't quite as god-awful as most of the movies that \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" shows, but westerns just aren't Roger Corman's forte. Portraying Rose Hood (Beverly Garland) becoming sheriff in an Old West town after her sheriff husband gets murdered and having to fight off baddies, the movie is pretty predictable. John Ireland is Rose's new hubby, secretly working for unctuous Allison Hayes (yes, the 50-foot woman). Also appearing briefly is frequent Corman co-star Dick Miller as a mailman (Miller nowadays stars in Joe Dante's movies).<br /><br />I do wish to assert that you'll probably want to watch the \"MST3K\" version to really enjoy this movie.

{"value":"When I noticed that \"Hamish Macbeth\" was being broadcast in the United States, I was thrilled. I then had the misfortune to watch the darn thing. I adore M. C. Beaton's books about the wonderful Scottish Constable. The characters in the book are entertaining and very well-written. The powers that be who are responsible for this mish-mash apparently have never have read one of Beaton's books. Only the name \"Hamish Macbeth\" has anything to do with the series. Besides the lack of familiar characters, I find the whole show offensively loud. It seems that the actors feel they must shout their lines and scream at each other. If you love M. C.

{"value":"This is a mildly interesting late 80's gore fest featuring some nasty slugs with a taste for human blood. If you can get past the ridiculousness of the whole thing you might actually get some minor enjoyment out of this. The acting is awful and the plot is simply there to hold the movie together between gory slug attacks, but the movie isn't a complete waste of time. The special effects are actually quite good, and the gore is well done. It reminded me of the remake of the Blob, probably because of the sliminess of it all. All in all, you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time, but I wouldn't suggest seeing this movie unless you've got a strong stomach and are into this sort of thing.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","mildli","interest","late","gore","fest","featur","some","nasti","slug","with","a","tast","for","human","blood","if","you","can","get","past","the","ridicul","of","the","whole","thing","you","mai","actual","get","some","minor","enjoy","out","of","thi","the","act","be","aw","and","the","plot","be","simpli","there","to","hold","the","movi","togeth","between","gori","slug","attack","but","the","movi","be","not","a","complet","wast","of","time","the","special","effect","be","actual","quit","good","and","the","gore","be","good","do","it","remind","me","of","the","remak","of","the","blob","probabl","becaus","of","the","slimi","of","it","all","all","in","all","you","can","certainli","do","wrong","with","a","hour","and","a","half","of","your","time","but","i","would","not","suggest","see","thi","movi","unless","you","have","get","a","strong","stomach","and","be","into","thi","sort","of","thing"],"filtered":["thi","mildli","interest","late","gore","fest","featur","nasti","slug","tast","human","blood","get","past","ridicul","whole","thing","mai","actual","get","minor","enjoy","thi","act","aw","plot","simpli","hold","movi","togeth","gori","slug","attack","movi","complet","wast","time","special","effect","actual","quit","good","gore","good","remind","remak","blob","probabl","becaus","slimi","certainli","wrong","hour","half","time","suggest","see","thi","movi","unless","get","strong","stomach","thi","sort","thing"],"filtered2":["mildli","interest","late","gore","fest","featur","nasti","slug","tast","human","blood","get","past","ridicul","whole","thing","mai","actual","get","minor","enjoy","act","aw","plot","simpli","hold","togeth","gori","slug","attack","complet","wast","time","special","effect","actual","quit","good","gore","good","remind","remak","blob","probabl","becaus","slimi","certainli","wrong","hour","half","time","suggest","see","unless","get","strong","stomach","sort","thing"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,8,21,22,25,29,32,46,52,60,89,103,106,111,120,138,148,150,174,201,203,206,269,270,274,292,305,354,358,389,414,440,460,483,495,631,644,646,737,872,1052,1097,1487,1560,1825,2327,2832,3847,4997],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,8,21,22,25,29,32,46,52,60,89,103,106,111,120,138,148,150,174,201,203,206,269,270,274,292,305,354,358,389,414,440,460,483,495,631,644,646,737,872,1052,1097,1487,1560,1825,2327,2832,3847,4997],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,2.389902141215977,1.8837873718108231,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,2.6390769554676132,1.3711311285073675,1.655771293751733,3.4244306149452273,1.838176641236591,1.9940046109572438,2.098582041218749,2.159084361316692,2.1183455303375887,2.2044500422972613,2.2907365189289424,2.3018654096236517,2.332712011146513,2.456282578459816,2.561435818751577,2.569760528637609,2.597304642813496,2.76533567167316,2.731603554088023,2.748952192422636,2.9752256367457734,2.8612813773965557,3.185521045582134,6.4061649450241624,3.0914425013694116,3.1254654785810323,3.212973749990824,3.216957819005698,3.613480989738201,3.5173618574831282,3.607563812710113,3.5670958631572662,3.5900195030592035,3.68099128126493,3.857614816944247,4.1302590120314875,4.186539847930077,4.581533656170946,4.573751515728891,4.798834931860927,11.814406790948803,5.3560264761848435,6.660975197850782,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.048164689374515E-4,2.0463497070976412E-4,2.0468549666480032E-4,2.0464434833267003E-4,2.046637154928045E-4,2.0463384241427038E-4,2.0469748638025673E-4,2.0460339623606914E-4,2.0463501395727324E-4,2.0484648206987082E-4,2.0647187928241834E-4,2.0463535196139912E-4,2.048291545713375E-4,2.0485049423537842E-4,2.0475743600462695E-4,2.0464515439713894E-4,2.0471556024485944E-4,2.0481190008348808E-4,2.046557193440939E-4,2.046549711024787E-4,2.048390893597216E-4,2.046754754412127E-4,2.0467578519980703E-4,2.0480690269923524E-4,2.0465579316856513E-4,2.048529427044047E-4,2.04707007488435E-4,2.046345120803339E-4,2.047272846230702E-4,2.0478977034141504E-4,2.0467647940754574E-4,2.047860996727676E-4,2.048866445352588E-4,2.0507681111083865E-4,2.0470665374897095E-4,2.0464503027660868E-4,2.04718816367143E-4,2.046658138904979E-4,2.0460361461226796E-4,2.04655655965548E-4,2.0486075590640666E-4,2.047483768864019E-4,2.0478656634500492E-4,2.0461379771132904E-4,2.0465570800429686E-4,2.0464495332226374E-4,2.0471422378351442E-4,2.0474972148579003E-4,2.0470808678692265E-4,2.0467564019349904E-4,2.0464545939350825E-4,2.0506474470589802E-4,2.0469695408605003E-4,2.046556610974684E-4,2.0469585785804547E-4,2.0463472144925814E-4,0.9838262975206153,2.0466664788314017E-4,2.0464574668954037E-4,2.0463460463854058E-4,2.047983172310539E-4,2.0471610605268106E-4,2.0463451909590274E-4,

{"value":"This film is probably pro-Muslimization. <br /><br />Why do I write that? The main character has a Muslim father and a Christian mother. He lives his first 20 years in a Christian village. In the end of the film he seemingly is a Muslim because of his head-wear, that he has kept his amulet, and his general clothing. He has a six year old child, who wears the same head-wear and therefore is probably a Muslim, although the mother is a Christian. The main character thus chooses to, it seems, to be a Muslim and his child becomes a Muslim. No one of the other male main characters, which are Christians, seems to breed a child. There are more Muslims in the world of this movie at the end of it, it therefore seems.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","probabl","promuslim","br","br","why","do","i","write","that","the","main","charact","have","a","muslim","father","and","a","christian","mother","he","live","hi","year","in","a","christian","villag","in","the","end","of","the","film","he","seemingli","be","a","muslim","becaus","of","hi","headwear","that","he","have","keep","hi","amulet","and","hi","gener","cloth","he","have","a","six","year","old","child","who","wear","the","same","headwear","and","therefor","be","probabl","a","muslim","although","the","mother","be","a","christian","the","main","charact","thu","choos","to","it","seem","to","be","a","muslim","and","hi","child","becom","a","muslim","no","on","of","the","other","male","main","charact","which","be","christian","seem","to","bre","a","child","there","be","much","muslim","in","the","world","of","thi","movi","at","the","end","of","it","it","therefor","seem"],"filtered":["thi","film","probabl","promuslim","br","br","write","main","charact","muslim","father","christian","mother","live","hi","year","christian","villag","end","film","seemingli","muslim","becaus","hi","headwear","keep","hi","amulet","hi","gener","cloth","six","year","old","child","wear","headwear","therefor","probabl","muslim","although","mother","christian","main","charact","thu","choos","seem","muslim","hi","child","becom","muslim","male","main","charact","christian","seem","bre","child","much","muslim","world","thi","movi","end","therefor","seem"],"filtered2":["probabl","promuslim","write","main","charact","muslim","father","christian","mother","live","year","christian","villag","end","seemingli","muslim","becaus","headwear","keep","amulet","gener","cloth","six","year","old","child","wear","headwear","therefor","probabl","muslim","although","mother","christian","main","charact","thu","choos","seem","muslim","child","becom","muslim","male","main","charact","christian","seem","bre","child","muslim","world","end","therefor","seem"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,22,24,35,57,65,67,115,116,134,148,165,179,180,225,237,343,397,514,584,649,684,879,1192,1205,1229,1348,1688,2612,3287],"values":[3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[10,22,24,35,57,65,67,115,116,134,148,165,179,180,225,237,343,397,514,584,649,684,879,1192,1205,1229,1348,1688,2612,3287],"values":[3.3716610723085094,1.2979240167361772,2.6420723132238515,4.389507038697402,3.668325173349496,1.9073850067444174,1.9570915389266579,2.201553588425805,2.2466628996789315,2.2443961816702407,4.603730819247303,2.448847599972298,7.523906168940284,8.129194437808064,2.641219492619754,2.640097787510554,3.112795625839981,6.635343589215059,3.405285399859865,3.5146700658174166,3.6375061693251913,16.52103604812595,3.8962296530720266,4.268777946167049,4.280272325592784,8.619199881374609,4.470719289830655,4.838444069955973,35.10026988980672,5.604922523601468]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3633495087918343E-4,2.3612552253122058E-4,2.3618382374676028E-4,2.361363432433456E-4,2.361586907472489E-4,2.3612422060632424E-4,2.3619765851711906E-4,2.3608908917345178E-4,2.361255724339359E-4,2.3636958262639033E-4,2.38245106466731E-4,2.3612596245232116E-4,2.3634958866039737E-4,2.3637421220985635E-4,2.3626683357713384E-4,2.3613727335022446E-4,2.3621851370481583E-4,2.3632967894044422E-4,2.3614946409949669E-4,2.3614860071362597E-4,2.3636105227822522E-4,2.3617226039252115E-4,2.361726178187699E-4,2.3632391252640514E-4,2.3614954928455467E-4,2.363770374651205E-4,2.3620864479495746E-4,2.3612499332492957E-4,2.3623204230611877E-4,2.3630414373063938E-4,2.3617341885568202E-4,2.3629990819577746E-4,2.364159255515169E-4,2.366353561887683E-4,2.3620823661977853E-4,2.361371301292248E-4,2.3622227090024024E-4,2.3616111205994103E-4,2.360893411547914E-4,2.3614939096785055E-4,2.363860530131422E-4,2.3625638038324843E-4,2.3630044668255468E-4,2.3610109129494804E-4,2.3614945101465838E-4,2.3613704133264795E-4,2.3621697158016165E-4,2.3625793189828038E-4,2.3620989018287175E-4,2.361724504979541E-4,2.3613762528140622E-4,2.3662143292745185E-4,2.361970443100397E-4,2.3614939688950401E-4,2.36195779387385E-4,2.3612523491289698E-4,0.9813373836545966,2.361620743927611E-4,2.3613795678840852E-4,2.3612510012659127E-4,2.363140058708933E-4,2.362191435050725E-4,2.3612500142009948E-4,2.3610099510202456E-4,2.3607725253895363E-4,2.362907037459052E-4,2.361365690132755E-4,2.362439079146759E-4,2.3631323951260898E-4,2.3620602879437962E-4,2.3614970966155733E-4,2.361013046146962E-4,2.3616170369069055E-4,2.3610117744760935E-4,2.3611356765556815E-4,2.3610131129695158E-4,2.3625457404084327E-4,2.361842571189563E-4,2.3612531658619848E-4,2.3614818974976415E-4]}}
{"value":"\"Houseboat Horror\" is often regarded as the worst Australian film ever made and described as a typical slasher film,which carried the promotion 'See the movie that can't get an Academy Award'.An underground disco band members begins to die slashed to death by burned maniac as they are attempting to shoot a music video on a remote lake in the Australian outback.Badly acted and written slasher flick with zero suspense and annoying characters.It certainly delivers the gore:heads are split in half with a machete,throats are cut and a woman is killed with a horseshoe.If you like cheesy slasher movies you can give this one a try,but you have been warned.At least it's better than Swedish \"The Bleeder\".4 out of

{"value":"This is the kind of movie you regret you put in your VCR. It is some weird bad rip off version of Stephen kings movie \"Misery (1990)\". I cannot understand how this movie got a 5.2 score, because it has no story what so ever, and when the movie finally ended, I was relieved.<br /><br />This movie should have been released as a short-movie instead.. to much time is spent on the same thing. And as in every bad movie, everything happens just at the end of the movie in a 10-15 minutes time span...<br /><br />So, before you decide to watch this movie, be sure to put some new batteries in your remote control, because you are going to do whole lot of fast-forwarding... don't worry, you wont miss anything important.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","kind","of","movi","you","regret","you","put","in","your","vcr","it","be","some","weird","bad","rip","off","version","of","stephen","king","movi","miseri","i","cannot","understand","how","thi","movi","get","a","score","becaus","it","have","no","stori","what","so","ever","and","when","the","movi","final","end","i","be","relievedbr","br","thi","movi","should","have","be","releas","a","a","shortmovi","instead","to","much","time","be","spend","on","the","same","thing","and","a","in","everi","bad","movi","everyth","happen","just","at","the","end","of","the","movi","in","a","minut","time","spanbr","br","so","befor","you","decid","to","watch","thi","movi","be","sure","to","put","some","new","batteri","in","your","remot","control","becaus","you","be","go","to","do","whole","lot","of","fastforward","do","not","worri","you","wont","miss","anyth","import"],"filtered":["thi","kind","movi","regret","put","vcr","weird","bad","rip","version","stephen","king","movi","miseri","understand","thi","movi","get","score","becaus","stori","ever","movi","final","end","relievedbr","br","thi","movi","releas","shortmovi","instead","much","time","spend","thing","everi","bad","movi","everyth","happen","end","movi","minut","time","spanbr","br","befor","decid","watch","thi","movi","sure","put","new","batteri","remot","control","becaus","go","whole","lot","fastforward","worri","wont","miss","anyth","import"],"filtered2":["kind","regret","put","vcr","weird","bad","rip","version","stephen","king","miseri","understand","get","score","becaus","stori","ever","final","end","relievedbr","releas","shortmovi","instead","time","spend","thing","everi","bad","everyth","happen","end","minut","time","spanbr","befor","decid","watch","sure","put","new","batteri","remot","control","becaus","go","whole","lot","fastforward","worri","wont","miss","anyth","import"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,8,9,17,22,24,29,44,59,72,79,85,87,94,104,111,119,122,152,156,159,193,212,220,249,255,283,327,518,541,600,625,824,825,883,1347,1404,1678,3129,3186,3252,4784,7023],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,8,9,17,22,24,29,44,59,72,79,85,87,94,104,111,119,122,152,156,159,193,212,220,249,255,283,327,518,541,600,625,824,825,883,1347,1404,1678,3129,3186,3252,4784,7023],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,2.1367141713444147,1.2770536940105968,2.5958480334723544,2.6420723132238515,1.3195384777338066,1.604729392502474,1.8693254449200722,1.9209463754160525,1.9469506069506084,2.011190219103739,2.115024371522662,2.08112281984698,2.0728240170322856,2.1183455303375887,2.1653408989309972,2.2489347673732487,2.3131195476980753,2.3451551414151686,4.60053593038899,2.517840471459249,2.5983793339432615,2.8336934208777267,2.6754694156628323,2.6754694156628323,2.7678802023081546,2.9674191958529437,3.4101163271295305,3.8023521382691974,3.558633189238533,3.6194333882654965,3.9081109809587793,3.8767358583910254,3.8614098879127985,4.566029469634981,4.436351646326448,4.679973728984199,5.482320201509136,5.501738287366237,5.501738287366237,6.0662680901040895,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.409702074900609E-4,2.4075667160687825E-4,2.4081611628889952E-4,2.4076770454651013E-4,2.4079049035382488E-4,2.4075534414722306E-4,2.4083022240173444E-4,2.407195236787007E-4,2.407567224883396E-4,2.4100551847254208E-4,2.429178271144851E-4,2.4075712015618716E-4,2.4098513236326814E-4,2.4101023885640508E-4,2.4090075419782672E-4,2.4076865289565086E-4,2.4085148662392346E-4,2.4096483215235845E-4,2.4078108274307994E-4,2.4078020242355194E-4,2.409968208179647E-4,2.4080432614165332E-4,2.4080469057813218E-4,2.4095895264117189E-4,2.407811695988794E-4,2.4101311952363049E-4,2.408414241543335E-4,2.4075613202122122E-4,2.4086528056278396E-4,2.4093879611840715E-4,2.408055073258464E-4,2.409344775116555E-4,2.4105277032522785E-4,2.4127650467341226E-4,2.4084100797358156E-4,2.407685068656461E-4,2.408553175095273E-4,2.407929591559197E-4,2.4071978060217082E-4,2.4078100817709688E-4,2.4102231189432875E-4,2.408900959845996E-4,2.409350265598177E-4,2.407317611987819E-4,2.4078106940160764E-4,2.4076841632749476E-4,2.4084991425345304E-4,2.4089167792962202E-4,2.4084269396814224E-4,2.408045199756396E-4,2.4076901172928752E-4,2.4126230833403933E-4,2.4082959614816167E-4,2.4078101421489223E-4,2.4082830641647607E-4,2.407563783474731E-4,0.9809713522425287,2.4079394036305164E-4,2.4076934973816359E-4,2.407562409175926E-4,2.4094885168561987E-4,2.4085212877650381E-4,2.4075614027516237E-4,2.407316631192188E-4,2.4070745489132754E-4,2.4092509253415939E-4,2.4076793474448404E-4,2.4087737889248663E-4,2.409480702966882E-4,2.4083875684592358E-4,2.4078133312136925E-4,2.407319787023876E-4,2.4079356239037122E-4,2.4073184904116235

{"value":"I expected alot from this movie. Kinda like Lee as a Naustradamous like caracter but instead all I got was a waste of time and a boring movie. I can't even explain this movie. It had wooden acting, terrible script from pieces from the Bible like hurricanes, tidal waves and earthquakes. But that was at the end! The rest of it I had to wait and hope that something meaningfull would happen but it didn't. This movie is about a couple that tries to find out the changes going on in the world like places in China where there was an earthquake and end up at a convent run by eight nuns and a priest. The convent end up being the key to the misshappenings. The whole movie is missleading and boring. One of Lees worst.","finished_norm":["i","expect","alot","from","thi","movi","kinda","like","lee","a","a","naustradam","like","caract","but","instead","all","i","get","be","a","wast","of","time","and","a","bore","movi","i","ca","not","even","explain","thi","movi","it","have","wooden","act","terribl","script","from","piec","from","the","bibl","like","hurrican","tidal","wave","and","earthquak","but","that","be","at","the","end","the","rest","of","it","i","have","to","wait","and","hope","that","someth","meaningful","would","happen","but","it","do","not","thi","movi","be","about","a","coupl","that","try","to","find","out","the","chang","go","on","in","the","world","like","place","in","china","where","there","be","a","earthquak","and","end","up","at","a","convent","run","by","eight","nun","and","a","priest","the","convent","end","up","be","the","kei","to","the","misshappen","the","whole","movi","be","misslead","and","bore","on","of","lee","wrong"],"filtered":["expect","alot","thi","movi","kinda","like","lee","naustradam","like","caract","instead","get","wast","time","bore","movi","ca","even","explain","thi","movi","wooden","act","terribl","script","piec","bibl","like","hurrican","tidal","wave","earthquak","end","rest","wait","hope","someth","meaningful","happen","thi","movi","coupl","try","find","chang","go","world","like","place","china","earthquak","end","convent","run","eight","nun","priest","convent","end","kei","misshappen","whole","movi","misslead","bore","lee","wrong"],"filtered2":["expect","alot","kinda","like","lee","naustradam","like","caract","instead","get","wast","time","bore","ca","even","explain","wooden","act","terribl","script","piec","bibl","like","hurrican","tidal","wave","earthquak","end","rest","wait","hope","someth","meaningful","happen","coupl","try","find","chang","go","world","like","place","china","earthquak","end","convent","run","eight","nun","priest","convent","end","kei","misshappen","whole","misslead","bore","lee","wrong"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,6,8,21,24,25,36,38,53,77,81,89,94,108,111,130,137,152,164,165,166,181,218,226,253,278,331,395,570,891,1236,1252,1397,1804,1870,2175,2207,2882,3588,5280,5776],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,5,6,8,21,24,25,36,38,53,77,81,89,94,108,111,130,137,152,164,165,166,181,218,226,253,278,331,395,570,891,1236,1252,1397,1804,1870,2175,2207,2882,3588,5280,5776],"values":[2.5841531782306313,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.162015545335049,3.9631084698357775,1.2796387880827016,1.4680183469605717,1.519311641348122,1.7003182735607676,1.9463902258768238,1.949757232424728,1.9940046109572438,2.08112281984698,4.277015007255866,2.1183455303375887,2.2642139034199635,2.2939035841256437,2.3131195476980753,2.3930275298746078,2.448847599972298,2.4423870329693536,2.4442286541160034,2.5940874818617203,2.5940874818617203,2.7073305177318163,2.8336934208777267,2.932274249550174,3.153168081130368,7.889252387867754,3.8767358583910254,4.396611317676934,4.662879295624898,4.422928625994308,4.869215728622727,9.935311602871959,5.274680836730892,5.039114765418124,5.501738287366237,5.878215858601149,12.978249881848246,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.3187465457651704E-4,2.3166917872259967E-4,2.317263796324286E-4,2.316797952178617E-4,2.3170172096235677E-4,2.316679013686387E-4,2.3173995330228215E-4,2.3163343296338685E-4,2.3166922768351228E-4,2.3190863272655834E-4,2.3374876022784922E-4,2.3166961034116841E-4,2.3188901610218273E-4,2.3191317493693824E-4,2.3180782283696824E-4,2.3168070777104292E-4,2.3176041489471832E-4,2.3186948213389035E-4,2.3169266844704961E-4,2.31691821355666E-4,2.3190026336973303E-4,2.317150345107698E-4,2.3171538519139347E-4,2.3186382454808477E-4,2.316927520244292E-4,2.3191594687179608E-4,2.3175073223857313E-4,2.3166865950389982E-4,2.3177368817377567E-4,2.3184442884434934E-4,2.3171617111051636E-4,2.31840273245783E-4,2.3195410103209595E-4,2.3216939040434875E-4,2.317503317667924E-4,2.3168056725302093E-4,2.3176410118143966E-4,2.3170409657815975E-4,2.316336801891394E-4,2.3169259669560057E-4,2.319247922714104E-4,2.3179756692385688E-4,2.3184080156982053E-4,2.3164520857154713E-4,2.3169265560915852E-4,2.3168048013228186E-4,2.3175890187423543E-4,2.3179908915749503E-4,2.3175195412256179E-4,2.3171522102838574E-4,2.3168105306030674E-4,2.3215572991360742E-4,2.3173935068699465E-4,2.3169260250549602E-4,2.3173810963694034E-4,2.3166889653243193E-4,0.9816895990098533,2.3170504074908923E-4,2.3168137831085204E-4,2.3166876428991782E-4,2.318541048586513E-4,2.317610328088966E-4,2.316686674462914E-4,2.3164511419405105E-4,2.3162181971902584E-4,2.3183124250942023E-4,2.3168001672688656E-4,2.3178532984537476E-4,2.318533529636743E-4,2.3174816560918505E-4,2.316929093746728E-4,2.3164541786535971E-4,2.317046770431

{"value":"Annie's wig does not look good. she is not cute and pretty enough to play Annie. Annie sticks out in the movie, as her outfits look like Halloween costumes. terrible acting and terrible plots. This movie is such a change from the 1982 version. I think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role. Ashley Johnson portrays a very boyish Annie. Not appealing at all. At least the casting director got it right with Daddy Warbucks. Ms. Hannigan was also miscast. Camilla Belle played Molly alright. \"Warning\" this movie might insult your IQ so you might just want to only show it to very young children. 8 and younger. Some of the plots are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world.","finished_norm":["anni","wig","doe","not","look","good","she","be","not","cute","and","pretti","enough","to","plai","anni","anni","stick","out","in","the","movi","a","her","outfit","look","like","halloween","costum","terribl","act","and","terribl","plot","thi","movi","be","such","a","chang","from","the","version","i","think","that","a","young","and","small","girl","should","have","have","the","lead","role","ashlei","johnson","portrai","a","veri","boyish","anni","not","appeal","at","all","at","littl","the","cast","director","get","it","right","with","daddi","warbuck","m","hannigan","be","conjur","miscast","camilla","bell","plai","molli","alright","warn","thi","movi","mai","insult","your","iq","so","you","mai","just","want","to","onli","show","it","to","veri","young","child","and","young","some","of","the","plot","be","too","fiction","and","can","hardli","take","place","in","the","real","world"],"filtered":["anni","wig","doe","look","good","cute","pretti","enough","plai","anni","anni","stick","movi","outfit","look","like","halloween","costum","terribl","act","terribl","plot","thi","movi","chang","version","think","young","small","girl","lead","role","ashlei","johnson","portrai","veri","boyish","anni","appeal","littl","cast","director","get","right","daddi","warbuck","m","hannigan","conjur","miscast","camilla","bell","plai","molli","alright","warn","thi","movi","mai","insult","iq","mai","want","onli","show","veri","young","child","young","plot","fiction","hardli","take","place","real","world"],"filtered2":["anni","wig","doe","look","good","cute","pretti","enough","plai","anni","anni","stick","outfit","look","like","halloween","costum","terribl","act","terribl","plot","chang","version","think","young","small","girl","lead","role","ashlei","johnson","portrai","veri","boyish","anni","appeal","littl","cast","director","get","right","daddi","warbuck","m","hannigan","conjur","miscast","camilla","bell","plai","molli","alright","warn","mai","insult","iq","mai","want","onli","show","veri","young","child","young","plot","fiction","hardli","take","place","real","world"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,11,12,14,15,16,18,21,28,31,32,37,39,40,46,58,78,80,84,92,93,121,128,135,157,164,165,166,180,220,278,363,416,469,527,665,690,709,776,855,916,1221,1541,1551,1943,1947,2012,2143,2482,2710,3036,3093,3334,3823,8507],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,11,12,14,15,16,18,21,28,31,32,37,39,40,46,58,78,80,84,92,93,121,128,135,157,164,165,166,180,220,278,363,416,469,527,665,690,709,776,855,916,1221,1541,1551,1943,1947,2012,2143,2482,2710,3036,3093,3334,3823,8507],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,2.4001215597131385,2.393227744058217,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,2.742262257014735,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,3.2569937516641474,3.311542587503466,1.865701314626681,2.0064197866819473,1.9951803900462557,2.2212694515902225,2.0489535369135887,2.035389827120098,2.2190595059394194,2.3409902041158843,7.098732214311264,2.3360150694757706,2.3930275298746078,2.448847599972298,4.884774065938707,2.7097314792693545,2.8336934208777267,2.8336934208777267,3.0349689855553557,3.1401446412440817,3.328770687675578,3.439602492783994,3.5929222627171646,3.634471265630037,3.6497387377608255,3.770603439954617,3.9201351739255808,4.100845126825194,4.470719289830655,4.605250182788262,4.573751515728891,4.85885294158718,5.089758498236879,5.014723312293965,5.3064295350454715,22.006953149464948,5.463272006538442,5.482320201509136,5.719991853386255,5.649374286172302,6.032366538428407,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.7809600260830527E-4,1.7793818273669385E-4,1.7798211704855166E-4,1.779463369498886E-4,1.7796317745993016E-4,1.7793720163923504E-4,1.7799254257930256E-4,1.7791072748576256E-4,1.7793822034210973E-4,1.7812210021138066E-4,1.7953544742939435E-4,1.7793851425003618E-4,1.7810703326759438E-4,1.7812558894762543E-4,1.7804467114354152E-4,1.7794703785475478E-4,1.7800825851784071E-4,1.7809202980947902E-4,1.779562244930667E-4,1.779555738674537E-4,1.7811567195816035E-4,1.7797340319916513E-4,1.779736725464872E-4,1.7808768438665467E-4,1.7795628868635783E-4,1.7812771798807002E-4,1.780008215586041E-4,1.7793778394030492E-4,1.780184533273853E-4,1.7807278712541946E-4,1.779742761875122E-4,1.7806959533417144E-4,1.781570230600051E-4,1.783223804021963E-4,1.7800051396818015E-4,1.7794692992705542E-4,1.7801108984466572E-4,1.7796500209953564E-4,1.779109173724854E-4,1.7795616938291986E-4,1.7813451187555059E-4,1.7803679388273626E-4,1.7807000112409852E-4,1.7791977197898436E-4,1.7795621463266565E-4,1.779468630122156E-4,1.7800709641195916E-4,1.7

{"value":"Return to Cabin by the Lake just.... was lacking. It must have had a very low budget because a fair amount of the movie must have been filmed with a regular video camera. So, within the same scene - you'll have some movie-quality camera shots AND simple video camera shots. It makes for a very odd blend! I think they should have found SOME way to not do the \"home video\" type effect! <br /><br />I think it's worthwhile to see it IF you have seen the original CBTL because then you can compare and see the differences. But if you haven't seen the original CBTL.... you'll never want to see it if you see this one first! It will probably seem way too cheesy and turn you off from even caring about the original one.","finished_norm":["return","to","cabin","by","the","lake","just","be","lack","it","must","have","have","a","veri","low","budget","becaus","a","fair","amount","of","the","movi","must","have","be","film","with","a","regular","video","camera","so","within","the","same","scene","you","will","have","some","moviequ","camera","shot","and","simpl","video","camera","shot","it","make","for","a","veri","odd","blend","i","think","thei","should","have","find","some","wai","to","not","do","the","home","video","typ","effect","br","br","i","think","it","worthwhil","to","see","it","if","you","have","see","the","origin","cbtl","becaus","then","you","can","compar","and","see","the","differ","but","if","you","have","not","see","the","origin","cbtl","you","will","never","want","to","see","it","if","you","see","thi","on","it","will","probabl","seem","wai","too","cheesi","and","turn","you","off","from","even","care","about","the","origin","on"],"filtered":["return","cabin","lake","lack","must","veri","low","budget","becaus","fair","amount","movi","must","film","regular","video","camera","within","scene","moviequ","camera","shot","simpl","video","camera","shot","make","veri","odd","blend","think","thei","find","wai","home","video","typ","effect","br","br","think","worthwhil","see","see","origin","cbtl","becaus","compar","see","differ","see","origin","cbtl","never","want","see","see","thi","probabl","seem","wai","cheesi","turn","even","care","origin"],"filtered2":["return","cabin","lake","lack","must","veri","low","budget","becaus","fair","amount","must","regular","video","camera","within","scene","moviequ","camera","shot","simpl","video","camera","shot","make","veri","odd","blend","think","find","wai","home","video","typ","effect","think","worthwhil","see","see","origin","cbtl","becaus","compar","see","differ","see","origin","cbtl","never","want","see","see","probabl","seem","wai","cheesi","turn","even","care","origin"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,12,15,19,22,33,35,37,38,42,69,96,106,141,148,183,204,205,217,231,240,256,302,384,441,482,488,543,672,736,771,772,877,1438,1610,1759,2022,3317],"values":[1.0,6.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,5,12,15,19,22,33,35,37,38,42,69,96,106,141,148,183,204,205,217,231,240,256,302,384,441,482,488,543,672,736,771,772,877,1438,1610,1759,2022,3317],"values":[0.6199767156205233,3.934201232816368,0.926017105726131,2.133457220525776,2.4001215597131385,1.312380678011735,2.5958480334723544,2.803707089537043,1.463169012899134,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.6219954307453837,6.381097563453174,2.0390708128715254,2.159084361316692,4.5315094715482385,2.3018654096236517,2.4885128563647294,2.624524614047584,2.571852579609833,2.6113665294700725,8.114805921017584,8.29982138298407,2.748952192422636,2.902686292364678,3.109204957709252,6.587358735728616,3.3154667220492153,3.3933092088131493,3.477726550625732,3.616452760127359,3.6841709341823097,3.7398317812878634,3.8059428063999263,3.865219416329466,4.828393734102471,5.051537285416681,4.751432692966343,4.900964426937307,5.541743621979936]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612973E-4,2.1169300653874426E-4,2.1174527517734865E-4,2.1170270760391535E-4,2.117227427540305E-4,2.1169183932737024E-4,2.1175767842838495E-4,2.1166034303434327E-4,2.116930512778971E-4,2.1191181310725396E-4,2.135932716651458E-4,2.1169340094007546E-4,2.118938879684197E-4,2.1191596365579456E-4,2.118196957667694E-4,2.1170354147023984E-4,2.117763756760951E-4,2.118760383584705E-4,2.117144708112858E-4,2.1171369676217488E-4,2.1190416541618467E-4,2.1173490831315577E-4,2.1173522875558997E-4,2.118708686101443E-4,2.1171454718202641E-4,2.1191849657461965E-4,2.117675279277586E-4,2.1169253209079122E-4,2.1178850443817631E-4,2.118531453425939E-4,2.1173594690714962E-4,2.118493480694334E-4,2.1195336081055463E-4,2.1215008639459358E-4,2.1176716198751674E-4,2.117034130686859E-4,2.1177974410483175E-4,2.1172491352726191E-4,2.116605689425247E-4,2.1171440524675943E-4,2.119265792606667E-4,2.1181032419177905E-4,2.1184983083759684E-4,2.116711032654151E-4,2.117144590803694E-4,2.1170333346011956E-4,2.1177499311905086E-4,2.118117151675545E-4,2.1176864445217772E-4,2.1173507874788994E-4,2.1170385698619575E-4,2.1213760380898696E-4,2.1175712777489404E-4,2.1171441055568418E-4,2.1175599373704444E-4,2.116927486810294E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502645E-4,2.117041541913147E-4,2.1169262784140992E-4,2.1186198702179436E-4,2.117769403092971E-4,2.1169253934833306E-4,2.1167101702582118E-4,2.1164973116690367E-4,2.1184109602769683E-4,2.117029100128491E-4,2.117991422816544E-4,2.1186129996057557E-4,2.1176518261149845E-4,2.1171469096440754E-4,2.1167129451241947E-4,2.1172544394045393E-4,2.1167118050363862E-4,2.1168228866486714E-4,2.1167130050324468E-4,2.1180870475627503E-4,2.1174566370740734E-4,2.1169282190338403E-4,2.1171

{"value":"Poor Whoopi Goldberg. Imagine her at a friend's dinner party, and she adds a comment to the in-depth political discussion going on.

It reminded me of a particularly bad episode of 'Sigmund And The Sea Monsters'. Actually, come to think of it, 'Sigmund' was vastly superior to this.<br /><br />And however did it get made?

{"value":"As usual, i went to watch this movie for A.R.Rahman. Otherwise, the film is no good. Rajni wanted to end his movie career with this film is it would be successful. But fortunately or unfortunately the film was a failure. After this he delivered a hit with Chandramukhi. I Am eagerly waiting for his forth coming Shivaji.<br /><br />I have read the other user's comment on Rajni. I found it interesting as the user is from TN too. Rajni is one actor who acts, i think, from his heart not from his mind. He is not a method actor like Kamal Hasan. I think we need to appreciate Rajni for his strong going at his age.<br /><br />Any ways, i need to fill 10 lines for this comment... so wish u good luck
