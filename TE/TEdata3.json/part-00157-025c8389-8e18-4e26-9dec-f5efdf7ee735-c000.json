{"value":"At the name of Pinter, every knee shall bow - especially after his Nobel Literature Prize acceptance speech which did little more than regurgitate canned, by-the-numbers, sixth-form anti-Americanism. But this is even worse; not only is it a tour-de-force of talentlessness, a superb example of how to get away with coasting on your decades-old reputation, but it also represents the butchery of a superb piece. The original Sleuth was a masterpiece of its kind. Yes, it was a theatrical confection, and it is easy to see how it's central plot device would work better on the stage than the screen, but it still worked terrifically well. This is a Michael Caine vanity piece, but let's face it, Caine is no Olivier. Not only can he not fill Larry's shoes, he couldn't even fill his bathroom slippers. The appropriately-named Caine is, after all, a distinctly average actor, whose only real recommendation, like so many British actors, is their longevity in the business. He was a good Harry Palmer, excellent in Get Carter, but that's yer lot, mate! Give this a very wide berth and stick to the superb original. This is more of a half-pinter.","finished_norm":["at","the","name","of","pinter","everi","knee","shall","bow","especi","after","hi","nobel","literatur","prize","accept","speech","which","do","littl","much","than","regurgit","can","bythenumb","sixthform","antiamerican","but","thi","be","even","wrong","not","onli","be","it","a","tourdeforc","of","talentless","a","superb","exampl","of","how","to","get","awai","with","coast","on","your","decadesold","reput","but","it","conjur","repres","the","butcheri","of","a","superb","piec","the","origin","sleuth","be","a","masterpiec","of","it","kind","ye","it","be","a","theatric","confect","and","it","be","easi","to","see","how","it","central","plot","devic","would","work","well","on","the","stage","than","the","screen","but","it","still","work","terrif","good","thi","be","a","michael","cain","vaniti","piec","but","let","face","it","cain","be","no","olivi","not","onli","can","he","not","fill","larri","shoe","he","can","not","even","fill","hi","bathroom","slipper","the","appropriatelynam","cain","be","after","all","a","distinctli","averag","actor","whose","onli","real","recommend","like","so","mani","british","actor","be","their","longev","in","the","busi","he","be","a","good","harri","palmer","excel","in","get","carter","but","that","yer","lot","mate","give","thi","a","veri","wide","berth","and","stick","to","the","superb","origin","thi","be","much","of","a","halfpint"],"filtered":["name","pinter","everi","knee","shall","bow","especi","hi","nobel","literatur","prize","accept","speech","littl","much","regurgit","bythenumb","sixthform","antiamerican","thi","even","wrong","onli","tourdeforc","talentless","superb","exampl","get","awai","coast","decadesold","reput","conjur","repres","butcheri","superb","piec","origin","sleuth","masterpiec","kind","ye","theatric","confect","easi","see","central","plot","devic","work","well","stage","screen","still","work","terrif","good","thi","michael","cain","vaniti","piec","let","face","cain","olivi","onli","fill","larri","shoe","even","fill","hi","bathroom","slipper","appropriatelynam","cain","distinctli","averag","actor","whose","onli","real","recommend","like","mani","british","actor","longev","busi","good","harri","palmer","excel","get","carter","yer","lot","mate","give","thi","veri","wide","berth","stick","superb","origin","thi","much","halfpint"],"filtered2":["name","pinter","everi","knee","shall","bow","especi","nobel","literatur","prize","accept","speech","littl","regurgit","bythenumb","sixthform","antiamerican","even","wrong","onli","tourdeforc","talentless","superb","exampl","get","awai","coast","decadesold","reput","conjur","repres","butcheri","superb","piec","origin","sleuth","masterpiec","kind","ye","theatric","confect","easi","see","central","plot","devic","work","well","stage","screen","still","work","terrif","good","michael","cain","vaniti","piec","let","face","cain","olivi","onli","fill","larri","shoe","even","fill","bathroom","slipper","appropriatelynam","cain","distinctli","averag","actor","whose","onli","real","recommend","like","mani","british","actor","longev","busi","good","harri","palmer","excel","get","carter","yer","lot","mate","give","veri","wide","berth","stick","superb","origin","halfpint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,11,14,15,20,25,30,32,39,41,48,50,64,69,72,80,85,122,124,143,155,192,209,218,251,267,298,307,416,466,553,580,598,643,669,696,741,744,790,1010,1174,1263,1349,1555,1582,1603,1831,1907,1910,1968,2068,2236,2359,2647,3026,3124,3190,3418,3489,3965,3973,4380,4668,4871,5274,5785,7236,7294,7328,8153],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,5,11,14,15,20,25,30,32,39,41,48,50,64,69,72,80,85,122,124,143,155,192,209,218,251,267,298,307,416,466,553,580,598,643,669,696,741,744,790,1010,1174,1263,1349,1555,1582,1603,1831,1907,1910,1968,2068,2236,2359,2647,3026,3124,3190,3418,3489,3965,3973,4380,4668,4871,5274,5785,7236,7294,7328,8153],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,1.852034211452262,2.9739294460164585,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,3.1375198335242067,3.3910232448024944,1.717994385570355,1.883428577602134,4.254065042302116,1.9209463754160525,1.9951803900462557,2.011190219103739,2.2489347673732487,2.2323930368088845,2.3409902041158843,2.3074766467914385,2.5318267134339894,2.6026896854443837,5.188174963723441,2.6942272927333892,2.7085302779237206,2.7819920465008363,2.8767855639325206,3.1401446412440817,3.4446025032006995,6.909356310378882,3.5039747767006686,3.5642670069567886,3.5813614403160887,3.7099788181381825,3.8095464139032247,3.716536218

{"value":"turned out to be another failed attempt by the laughable sci-fi channel. i am not sure who wrote the script, and interpreted the poem, but i am sure it was by some 17 year old teen who thought it would be awesome to a have a scoped crossbow in the movie. AAAAAAAH! when i saw that part, I lost all hope. Then...they set off for heorot in a what looks to be the ship that Christopher Columbus sailed in! when they reach Heorot, (which is supposed to be a Norse mead hall) the sci-fi group of idiots decided to make heorot look like a big stone castle. when i saw that part.. i wanted to scream. i really wanted this movie to be good, but sci-fi has yet to produce a good movie, so i don't know why i got my hopes up. Oh..and Grendel and his mother, are stupid also. (this comment is off topic about \"Grendel\")If anyone from the sci-fi channel is reading this..here is some good advice. NOT EVERY MOVIE YOU MAKE HAS TO BE ABOUT A BIG MONSTER THAT CAN RIP PEOPLE IN HALF, THATS NOT WHAT SCIENCE FICTION IS ABOUT!

{"value":"This is far worse than those awful Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60s. They were terrible, but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then Stan and Ollie resurgence. New audiences had rediscovered the pair's comedic genius and the cartoons were mind-numbing garbage geared to cash in on children's interest. It was to be expected. But, how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of... I can't even think of a word. I'm sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival, but you can't inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing. The impressionists (I hesitate to call them actors) do a Vegas act and that's where it belongs. The plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days, trying to stretch out two-reel ideas for a feature. If this film was someone's first exposure to the REAL Laurel and Hardy, I'm sure that viewer would dismiss the original duo's reputation as senility gone amok. The only movie I hate worse than this is I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE.

{"value":"This is one of those films that I remember being in the can for years before anything happening w/it. I don't think it's terrible, but it's not really good either. Alec Baldwin was pretty good, but the plot is it kind of flimsy at best. The cast is pretty good in what they're given, but again you are only as good as the script. Baldwin directing this although I could have sworn he didn't direct all of it, I thought I read somewhere or lots of re-shoots wasn't bad but he definitely has some potential in there. Although his work on \"30 Rock\" is nothing short of genius & should keep him busy for a little while longer. I just hope the show bows out gracefully a la Seinfeld, but maybe not even that long. 9 years it went. So if you want to see a film that you won't get much from, but won't really hate either well this is for you. I can't remember the last time a film had been wrapped so long before finally being released & only on DVD at that. It was nice to see Alec Baldwin & Anthony Hopkins again together since their excellent yet not much people have seen \"The Edge.\" Now pick up that excellent film for some real entertainment.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","that","film","that","i","rememb","be","in","the","can","for","year","befor","anyth","happen","wit","i","do","not","think","it","terribl","but","it","not","realli","good","either","alec","baldwin","be","pretti","good","but","the","plot","be","it","kind","of","flimsi","at","well","the","cast","be","pretti","good","in","what","thei","re","give","but","again","you","be","onli","a","good","a","the","script","baldwin","direct","thi","although","i","can","have","swear","he","do","not","direct","all","of","it","i","think","i","read","somewher","or","lot","of","reshoot","be","not","bad","but","he","definit","have","some","potenti","in","there","although","hi","work","on","rock","be","noth","short","of","geniu","should","keep","him","busi","for","a","littl","while","long","i","just","hope","the","show","bow","out","gracefulli","a","la","seinfeld","but","mayb","not","even","that","long","year","it","go","so","if","you","want","to","see","a","film","that","you","wo","not","get","much","from","but","wo","not","realli","hate","either","good","thi","be","for","you","i","ca","not","rememb","the","last","time","a","film","have","be","wrap","so","long","befor","final","be","releas","onli","on","dvd","at","that","it","be","nice","to","see","alec","baldwin","anthoni","hopkin","again","togeth","sinc","their","excel","yet","not","much","peopl","have","see","the","edg","now","pick","up","that","excel","film","for","some","real","entertain"],"filtered":["thi","film","rememb","year","befor","anyth","happen","wit","think","terribl","realli","good","either","alec","baldwin","pretti","good","plot","kind","flimsi","well","cast","pretti","good","thei","re","give","onli","good","script","baldwin","direct","thi","although","swear","direct","think","read","somewher","lot","reshoot","bad","definit","potenti","although","hi","work","rock","noth","short","geniu","keep","busi","littl","long","hope","show","bow","gracefulli","la","seinfeld","mayb","even","long","year","go","want","see","film","wo","get","much","wo","realli","hate","either","good","thi","ca","rememb","last","time","film","wrap","long","befor","final","releas","onli","dvd","nice","see","alec","baldwin","anthoni","hopkin","togeth","sinc","excel","yet","much","peopl","see","edg","pick","excel","film","real","entertain"],"filtered2":["rememb","year","befor","anyth","happen","wit","think","terribl","realli","good","either","alec","baldwin","pretti","good","plot","kind","flimsi","well","cast","pretti","good","re","give","onli","good","script","baldwin","direct","although","swear","direct","think","read","somewher","lot","reshoot","bad","definit","potenti","although","work","rock","noth","short","geniu","keep","busi","littl","long","hope","show","bow","gracefulli","la","seinfeld","mayb","even","long","year","go","want","see","wo","get","wo","realli","hate","either","good","ca","rememb","last","time","wrap","long","befor","final","releas","onli","dvd","nice","see","alec","baldwin","anthoni","hopkin","togeth","sinc","excel","yet","peopl","see","edg","pick","excel","real","entertain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,6,8,9,11,12,13,14,20,23,28,30,32,37,48,49,57,68,72,77,78,79,80,81,92,94,99,102,104,122,134,144,145,156,162,163,166,181,194,195,207,237,247,262,270,272,290,327,339,392,406,446,547,580,582,766,790,804,851,1341,1552,1597,1712,1989,2514,2885,3168,3973,4064,6442,8305,8571],"values":[3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,5,6,8,9,11,12,13,14,20,23,28,30,32,37,48,49,57,68,72,77,78,79,80,81,92,94,99,102,104,122,134,144,145,156,162,163,166,181,194,195,207,237,247,262,270,272,290,327,339,392,406,446,547,580,582,766,790,804,851,1341,1552,1597,1712,1989,2514,2885,3168,3973,4064,6442,8305,8571],"values":[1.967100616408184,3.3930723249613526,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,1.982619630677639,2.133457220525776,2.2635883139467947,1.1175081997259209,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.4876543214774305,1.6955116224012472,1.6920303308087352,3.668325173349496,2.0064197866819473,1.9209463754160525,1.9463902258768238,4.012839573363895,3.893901213901217,1.9951803900462557,1.949757232424728,2.0489535369135887,2.08112281984698,6.169290621769827,4.175107420354542,2.0728240170322856,2.2489347673732487,2.2443961816702407,2.2931108769894046,2.34599021453259,2.3451551414151686,2.3586007221245198,2.4000574358028657,2.4423870329693536,2.4442286541160034,2.5378812223426954,2.51289241584188,5.1063596758091165,5.280195575021108,2.7303758068497004,2.726701583487816,2.731603554088023,2.8028805344481915,5.7225627

{"value":"Thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles over family honor. David Morse is the responsible, straight-laced cop and 'good' brother; Viggo Mortensen, the 'bad' boy, is a former soldier and ex-convict. As an actor (particularly in his earliest years), Sean Penn seems to have modulated his performances under the Method. Turning first-time writer and director for this arty, obtuse drama, he works his script and characters out through the same methodical process, slowing the pacing down to a crawl (ostensibly so we can catch every nuance and inflection). This approach might be fascinating if there were three-dimensional characters to care about, but photogenic Morse and Mortensen aren't really convincing as siblings. Worse, we expect more from prominently-billed veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis, who hardly get a chance to come through with anything interesting. The picture is balky with turgid sequences, a wobbly narrative and confusing editing (always slanted to point up the artistic excesses).

{"value":"This film is just plain horrible. John Ritter doing pratt falls, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, poor editing, horrible sound mixing (dialogue is tough to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes nowhere. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I started to wonder if she wasn't dead inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are awful (the oldest one is definitely reading her lines from a cue card). This movie is seriously horrible. There's a reason Bogdanovich couldn't get another project until 4 years later. Please don't watch it. If you see it in your television listings, cancel your cable. If a friend suggests it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you're better off finding another soulmate.

{"value":"Now, I like sci-fi cartoons. However, when \"Robotboy\" appeared in Canada in late 2006, I watched the premiere and was inevitably appalled. The characters are generic and stereotypical (Do they REALLY need to make an African-American man wear tiger-stripe print clothing and speak in a Jamacian accent? WHY are all the Asian characters vibrant yellow and squinting? Does the mother HAVE to have big thighs and chest and constantly complain?) to the point where things become unrealistic, predictable, gross and sometimes disturbing. There are heavy similarities to, even stabs, at Astro Boy. Allow me to explain (dub names for the young): Robotboy/Astro, Kamikaze/Tenma, Constantine/Shadow, Gus/Abercrombie, Tommy/Alejo, Lola/Zoran+Kennedy, Moshimo/O'Shay, and it so on. Brief resemblances to \"My Life As A Teenage Robot\", \"Star Wars\", \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\", \"Kamen Riders\", \"Sailor Moon\" and co. are afoot. Not to mention the abundant racial/gender stereotyping. Don't even get me started on the innuendos. I'll just say they're hidden and quite dirty. But seriously. Don't even try watching this.

{"value":"Bangville Police supposedly marked the debut of the Keystone Kops, named after the studio they worked for. In this one, however, they don't dress in the silly cop costumes or drive the fast-paced car that's their trademark. Anyway, Mabel Normand is a farm girl here who's begged her dad for a calf. She later sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police. One answers and the chase is on. Next, Mabel slams her door just as someone is coming in. Turns out it's her mother who jumps to the conclusion robbers are in there! So while Mabel blocks her door with furniture, the mother and father try to fight their way in! This was perhaps the most amusing part of the short along with some explosions of the cop car. This was a short 7 minutes that went by so fast it's over before it's begun. The only real characterization that's developed is Mabel's who exudes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so optimistically cheery here except, of course, when she's frightened. It's easy to see why she became a star.

{"value":"In the glory days of the 90s (god rest its soul) you could turn on the great Comedy Central at any hour of the day and see the greatest sketch comedy show of all time Saturday Night Live. Whpat a glorious show that was, whether it was the original Not-Ready-for-Primetime Players or the second golden age of SNL featuring the greats- Chris Farley, Adam Sandler, David Spade... and then, it all went to hell. I was first exposed to MadTV about a year and a half ago, and I think I must've passed out from shock. How could a show so terrible prevail for so long? There are so many horrible flaws. I suppose I'll start with the writing. The writing, for most part, is terrible. It is nothing more than kindergarten bathroom humor. The cast, for the most part, is talentless. There are a few sketches I have enjoyed, such as some of Ms. Swan and Stuart, and there are a few talents on the show such as the magnificent Alex Borstein. Phil LaMarr is a talented actor, just not as a comedian. Although there a few sparse ha ha moments, they are not enough to redeem this endless line of horrible drivel populated by babbling idiots.

{"value":"This is one of the most hateful and cruel movies I've seen in a long time. Sadly I was duped into sticking with it, since Donald Sutherland's presence misleadingly gave it some credibility. [That's the last time that'll happen.]<br /><br />Lesley Ann Warren's character was annoyingly whiny and as stupid as they come. There were smarter characters than hers who were killed in the film. Thats just one of many things in this movie that made me ask, \"Where is the justice?\"<br /><br />Why is late-night cable so filled with sadistic garbage filled with pathological mayhem? Most of these films seem to have a particular problem with women, and seem to focus on them being terrorized and murdered. This film could have been every bit as suspenseful without being sick and twisted in the process. All it ends up doing is turning the viewer's stomach with its sickness, and insulting the viewer's intelligence.<br /><br />The cast is misleadingly good. My guess is that they BAGGED Sutherland first, and used him to lure the others like lemmings into this.<br /><br />I'm kicking myself for wasting time, giving this piece of garbage a

{"value":"The movie lacks credence with the helicopters which didn't exist until the 1950s. But no woman would do what was done here, even a woman before the women's movement of the 60s and 70s. About the only portion of the movie that you could believe in was that Germany would want to know where the landing would be. Ignore for the moment that the British had captured all the spies but even if they had not, they wouldn't have let one roam around like this just to reassure the Germans that the landing would be at Calais. It isn't one major thing that makes the movie not work. It is the culmination of all the things wrong that makes the movie fail. Bad directing, bad scripts, no attempt at authenticity (at all) all combine to just make the movie fall flat. Generally speaking spies should fade into the woodwork. The suspense comes in with the spy wondering if the information they have is valid or not and worrying about being detected. On this one that game was over from the start. This spy was doing anything but spying.

{"value":"Nice attempt and good ideas (redemption of the prostitute, human beings helping each other out,...) but a poor result... The director obviously tried to emulate his French colleague Tran Anh Hung by recreating an ambiance which is suppose to portray Viet Nam... The only problem is that this Viet Nam is long gone and when \"The scent of the green papaya\" had a historical background... trying to project this kind of ambiance (muffled sounds and the slow pace of life...) on modern days leaves a feeling of fake. Besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome becomes too obvious.<br /><br />I can only suppose the action takes place in Saigon or Da Nang because that is where Harvey Keitel, ex-marine in the movie, was probably stationed during the war... But in Southern Viet Nam nobody or very few people speak with the clip Northern accent displayed by the actors... Seriously odd even for a bad Vietnamese speaker.<br /><br />An old poet with leprosy...very doubtful (not a disease for people of his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate

{"value":"Just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. Take Mike Myers, for example. He's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his SNL days, over ten years ago. He's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. His Cat is painfully unfunny. He tries way to hard. He's some weird Type A comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (Cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street.) Alec Balwin tries to do a funny Great Santini impression, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. There's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity Paris Hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a Dr. Seuss story. Avoid this movie at all costs, folks. It's not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they'll make Horton Hears a Who with Robin Williams.

{"value":"First off, I must admit that both films I've seen by this director I saw without titles and so may have missed the points. My Czech isn't bad but, having sat through two of his films, I wish I hadn't even tried to learn. Samotari is too cool. Way too cool. It's about ten different story lines that weave in and out together. That's not so deeply unusual in a town the size of Prague (tiny, really.) The main characters are between 20 and 30. They've got jobs and only one studies. The best character is the young Balkan girl. Her sentiments are echoed by immigrants here every damn day. That's about it. The only great character. Everyone else is making their own lives hell quite on their own. How can I sympathise with such obvious incompetence? Perhaps there are interesting bits with Japanese tourists but do I need another stereotype in film? If you like alright music, see this film. If you want to laugh at others' stupidity, see this film. If you like irony and dry humor, see an original Jarmusch not an imitation. And under NO circumstances see Ondricek's film, Septej (Whisper.) That is unless you enjoy homophobic

{"value":"Three tales are told in this film, that seemed to have been shot without knowledge of this being a combined vignette film. The makers relate the three vignettes by having them all connected to shrink Martin Kove, although you never see some of the leads with Kove.<br /><br />The first vignette has sexy Vivian Schilling, a woman afraid of everything under the sun(she makes Adrian Monk look brave), having a paranoia laced evening at home alone. You will literally scream at Vivian for doing some ridiculous things. She spends the majority of her time in a nighty which shows off her amazing features. But her film is the worst if not the most nail-biting.<br /><br />The second vignette is owned by Bill Paxton as he portrays the roommate from Hell. His geeky roommate allows him to take complete advantage of him, and Bill does so whenever he can.<br /><br />The last vignette was funny as a man fears that death will take him at any moment, much like his pal who choked to death on an olive.<br /><br />Not very interesting, as the movie as a whole seems chopped together with very little thought involved.

{"value":"It's a pretty good cast, but the film has nowhere near the grace of the original Italian comedy \"Big Deal on Madonna Street\" Anyone looking for an entertaining caper film should visit the original. William Macy may be one of our greatest living actors, but here he's put to little use. And his role in the original was played by Marcello Mastroianni, so I sort of feel sorry for him trying to fill those shoes. Might as well try to imitate Bogart or a young De Niro. The art direction is rich and textured but brings nothing to the story, the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things they take away are missed. Even starting the way they do seems bizarrely gratuitous and takes away from the surprise of the original. Sam Rockwell has his odd and genial charm and Luis Guzman has that odd charisma, but the love story part of the movie just seems clunky and flat. It's too bad nobody has figured out how to make this movie as well as it was first made, but then again it's too bad we live in a culture where we feel like we need to remake amazing things instead of

{"value":"This \"Debuted\" today on the SciFi channel and all I can say is \"I am speechless\" I taped it today so I could watch it tonight after work. I had high hopes, Now I am tearing apart the closets looking for a length of rope so I can hang myself. Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I wish I could say something nice like \"It was fun to make fun of this movie\" but this movie is giving me nothing to work with. I know you are not supposed to post spoilers here with out prior warning but I am going to anyway \"This movie sucks\" There I said it! They should show this flick to film students to show them what NOT to do! My nine year old niece could make a better film. The only decent thing about this film is the sound and/or sound track. OH! I just found a rusty C-clamp in my old tool box. I am going to put it on the thumb of my left hand and tighten it until the pain erases the memory of what my eyes have seen. I could just tape over this VHS but I think I will burn it in the fire pit instead. I could wash with soap but I fear I will never be clean again. Christmas is coming. Buy this movie and give it to people you hate.

{"value":"Really a terrible movie. It's to be expected, though. Clearly a low budget: nothing all that innovative, an actress (if you can call what she does \"acting\") who always has roles with nudity in a shower scene, a man in a reptile suit almost modeled after predator, a cabin in the woods, etc. But there are some redeeming points. Although the story is not new, for the most part, there's a few parts that aren't so regurgitated. For one, the black guy doesn't die when he's attacked (the first time) and he isn't even one of the first couple to die. But that's minor. More importantly, there's a very interesting twist regarding Kat's experiments and Wes & Steve that I didn't see coming. When Steve told Kat he knew what she did, I believed what he said and what Kat replied with. But when the creature revealed who he really was, I was pleasantly surprised at the novelty of the revelation. It could be because of my lack of experience with the genre, or that it's a genuinely clever twist.<br /><br />Either way, the movie's pretty bad and don't watch it if there's anything better on... Unless you're in the mood for a cheap scifi flick.","finished_norm":["realli","a","terribl","movi","it","to","be","expect","though","clearli","a","low","budget","noth","all","that","innov","a","actress","if","you","can","call","what","she","doe","act","who","alwai","have","role","with","nuditi","in","a","shower","scene","a","man","in","a","reptil","suit","almost","model","after","predat","a","cabin","in","the","wood","etc","but","there","be","some","redeem","point","although","the","stori","be","not","new","for","the","much","part","there","a","few","part","that","be","not","so","regurgit","for","on","the","black","gui","doe","not","die","when","he","attack","the","time","and","he","be","not","even","on","of","the","coupl","to","die","but","that","minor","much","importantli","there","a","veri","interest","twist","regard","kat","experi","and","we","steve","that","i","do","not","see","come","when","steve","tell","kat","he","know","what","she","do","i","believ","what","he","sai","and","what","kat","repli","with","but","when","the","creatur","reveal","who","he","realli","be","i","be","pleasantli","surpris","at","the","novelti","of","the","revel","it","can","be","becaus","of","my","lack","of","experi","with","the","genr","or","that","it","a","genuin","clever","twistbr","br","either","wai","the","movi","pretti","bad","and","do","not","watch","it","if","there","anyth","well","on","unless","you","re","in","the","mood","for","a","cheap","scifi","flick"],"filtered":["realli","terribl","movi","expect","though","clearli","low","budget","noth","innov","actress","call","doe","act","alwai","role","nuditi","shower","scene","man","reptil","suit","almost","model","predat","cabin","wood","etc","redeem","point","although","stori","new","much","part","part","regurgit","black","gui","doe","die","attack","time","even","coupl","die","minor","much","importantli","veri","interest","twist","regard","kat","experi","steve","see","come","steve","tell","kat","know","believ","sai","kat","repli","creatur","reveal","realli","pleasantli","surpris","novelti","revel","becaus","lack","experi","genr","genuin","clever","twistbr","br","either","wai","movi","pretti","bad","watch","anyth","well","unless","re","mood","cheap","scifi","flick"],"filtered2":["realli","terribl","expect","though","clearli","low","budget","noth","innov","actress","call","doe","act","alwai","role","nuditi","shower","scene","man","reptil","suit","almost","model","predat","cabin","wood","etc","redeem","point","although","stori","new","part","part","regurgit","black","gui","doe","die","attack","time","even","coupl","die","minor","importantli","veri","interest","twist","regard","kat","experi","steve","see","come","steve","tell","kat","know","believ","kat","repli","creatur","reveal","realli","pleasantli","surpris","novelti","revel","becaus","lack","experi","genr","genuin","clever","twistbr","either","wai","pretti","bad","watch","anyth","well","unless","re","mood","cheap","scifi","flick"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,8,9,13,15,17,18,19,20,21,22,26,33,34,45,49,55,60,61,66,68,78,86,87,90,91,104,128,130,131,142,166,183,197,207,217,229,237,253,256,257,293,326,333,351,355,429,435,460,467,494,495,612,634,655,761,781,833,884,955,1019,1097,1104,1105,1129,1166,1610,1821,2117,2747,2892,3378,4177,4434,5678,6762,7328],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,8,9,13,15,17,18,19,20,21,22,26,33,34,45,49,55,60,61,66,68,78,86,87,90,91,104,128,130,131,142,166,183,197,207,217,229,237,253,256,257,293,326,333,351,355,429,435,460,467,494,495,612,634,655,761,781,833,884,955,1019,1097,1104,1105,1129,1166,1610,1821,2117,2747,2892,3378,4177,4434,5678,6762,7328],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,2.2635883139467947,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,2.430631986809635,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,1.3982850089458962,1.8162961064622165,1.6920303308087352,1.9536997889255368,1.838176641236591,3.7637034094785053,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,2.0064197866819473,2.031112399272319,2.115024371522662,2.0477128419653545,2.0105926690411424,2.0728240170322856,2.3409902041158843,2.2642139034199635,2.2512118082053005,2.2844323215331563,2.4423870329693536,2.4885128563647294,2.558331832813986,2.5531798379045583,2.6113665294700725,2.8432628718938773,2.640097787510554,2.7073305177318163,2.748952192422636,2.7602659523229094,5.802459255736427,2.942840385588056,5.897857368910622,3.0135689919434205,3.0316467233633775,3.2872346624216657,3.2829611516442836,3.216957819005698,3.342254038012865,3.3243163373261977,3.5173618574831282,3.5929222627171646,3.51198550044674

{"value":"I wanted to see this movie ever since it was first advertised on TV. I went to Tinsel Town to see it Last Night at 7:40. I regret the day that wasted my ticket on this trash when I could of saw something better. The beginning was all a bunch sex trash and cliches. They exaggerated the way love works in reality. All of the girls were stereo types. The boyfriend was too stupid for his own age. The passing gases that the pregnant girl kept having barely got any laughs. The bank robbery was completely boring with gags that have been used in other movies. Their getaway car was an old beat up Chevy van that they claimed that had no breaks. Hey why didn't they get nice girlish vehicle for the robbery instead? It might have boosted the audience opinion about the movie. This movie was very low low low low low budgeted since nothing in there was damaged or destroyed. This movie had a lot of stuff in it that would drive Christian people nuts. Hey I even expected a car chase scene because all bank robbing movies have car chases but I but there was never any.

{"value":"Whatever rating I give BOOM is only because of the superb location photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (her downward phase), and RICHARD BURTON (his miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore\" and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play--but apparently, he was the only one. Taylor reportedly hated it and Burton needed the money.<br /><br />Whatever, it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner, exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears.<br /><br />It's so campy that among Taylor fans it's probably considered a \"must see\" kind of thing. But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. Sadly, this is the film that signified the end of Taylor being taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a BOMB.

{"value":"Priyadarshan's HERA PHERI was a nice situational comedy This film however actually lacks a story but is quite funny but illogical<br /><br />In fact they is no proper story yet it somehow manages a nice flow though it isn't anything great<br /><br />The first half has 2 funny scenes like the one where Akshay and John invite Neha for a lunch and another when Paresh enters<br /><br />The first half gets boring slowly but the second half is funnier though they is no script <br /><br />The jokes are funny though one does wonder how they never hear each person's voices from inside the rooms?<br /><br />The climax confusion is treated like a stage play but it's quite funny But the film ends abruptly<br /><br />Direction is okay Music is good<br /><br />Akshay Kumar excels in his

{"value":"\"When a small Bavarian village is beset with a string of mysterious deaths, the local (magistrate) demands answers into (sic) the attacks. While the police detective refuses to believe the nonsense about vampires returning to the village, the local doctor treating the victims begins to suspect the truth about the crimes,\" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />An inappropriately titled, dramatically unsatisfying, vampire mystery.<br /><br />Curiously, the film's second tier easily out-perform the film's lackluster stars: stoic Lionel Atwill (as Otto von Niemann), skeptical Melvyn Douglas (as Karl Brettschneider), and pretty Fay Wray (as Ruth Bertin). The much more enjoyable supporting cast includes bat-crazy Dwight Frye (as Herman), hypochondriac Maude Eburne (as Aunt Gussie Schnappmann), and suspicious George E. Stone (as Kringen). Mr. Frye, Ms. Eburne, and Mr. Stone outperform admirably. Is there another movie ending with a mad rush to the bathroom? <br /><br />Magnesium sulfate Epsom salts it's a laxative! <br /><br />**** The Vampire Bat (1933) Frank Strayer ~ Dwight Frye, Melvyn

{"value":"This is the biggest piece of crap ever. It looks like they spent more time, effort, and money making the DVD cover than they did on the actual movie. I really thought the DVD had been switched out with someone's homemade porno until I recognized one of the actors from the cover. This movie looks like someone made it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and they spent half of that on rats. The picture is really clear, but that, along with the very unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you can call it that, production, acting, if that is actually what they are doing, and script, if they had one, makes this movie look worse than an old porno. At least the old porno has a point. This just looks like some PETA members got together and decided to make a really disturbing, pointless PSA about animals rights and feelings. This is so not worth the money or the time. It has nothing in common with the actual BTK serial killer other than the name of the killer and that of some of the victims.

{"value":"This is the first film of the Horrorfest I have watched and after Im almost thinking I don't need to see any of the others. I was told its a \"thinking mans horror movie\" and have to say that if this was supposed to make me think I shutter to think what the splatter/gore films in the collection will be like. Don't get me wrong not even the gore in this film is worth sitting through.<br /><br />The plot is very washed out with way too much art for arts sake. The camera effects and music are out of place most of the time and the characters are banal to say the least. Several characters and scenes seem worthless in the end when they start to reveal some of the hooks of \"The Hamiltons\". I figured out who Lenny was about half hour in when I figured out the movie. I was so visually under whelmed and confused by the Lenny reveal that I completely felt ripped off. I expected what I got but they could have gone so much further, in fact all the gore falls completely flat.

{"value":"When I first saw this film in cinema 11 years ago, I loved it. I still think the directing and cinematography are excellent, as is the music. But it's really the script that has over the time started to bother me more and more. I find Emma Thompson's writing self-absorbed and unfaithful to the original book; she has reduced Marianne to a side-character, a second fiddle to her much too old, much too severe Elinor - she in the movie is given many sort of 'focus moments', and often they appear to be there just to show off Thompson herself.<br /><br />I do understand her cutting off several characters from the book, but leaving out the one scene where Willoughby in the book is redeemed? For someone who red and cherished the book long before the movie, those are the things always difficult to digest.<br /><br />As for the actors, I love Kate Winslet as Marianne. She is not given the best script in the world to work with but she still pulls it up gracefully, without too much sentimentality. Alan Rickman is great, a bit old perhaps, but he plays the role beautifully.

{"value":"This is one of those films that's more interesting to watch from an academic perspective than from an entertainment perspective. I do my ratings based on how much I enjoyed or was entertained by the movie, so I'm giving it a 4. If I were to rate it as an academic film, though, it would get a 10.<br /><br />It is shot in a very interesting manner, like a pseudo-silent film with elements of sound effect and reality. It's meant to convey disjointed memory and fragmentation of the mind, and it is interesting in these respects.<br /><br />However, the film has a lot of disgusting elements to it that I didn't find all that entertaining. They're mainly just disturbing. It has some very interesting imagery too, and some interesting concepts, but some of the character relationships (especially between the mother and son) are pretty disturbing.<br /><br />In all, this film will either appeal to you or it won't. For me, it was interesting from an academic perspective, but it wasn't a good watch, and I'll probably not go back to it a second time.<br /><br />4/10 if you're looking for entertainment. 10/10 from

{"value":"Cage (1989) was another one of those low budget \"buddy\" action flicks that were produced during the 80's thanks in large part due to the films such as 48hrs. and Lethal Weapon. This one stars Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as to former Vietnam Vets who happen to run a local dive bar. Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in 'Nam. But Lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft. Although he's huge, Lou has the brain of a child. One day some ruffians throw their wait around in the bar and Lou and Rebb beat the tar out of them. But payback's a mother. They crash the bar leaving Lou and Reb with nothing. That is until these two thugs come into the picture (one of them's a real nice guy) who have a plan in mind.<br /><br />The film's a waste of time. Maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation perhaps it could have worked. Alas, it doesn't and the audience is left holding the bag. Oh well. It's too bad because you have all the elements for a great B-movie.

{"value":"I didn't feel as if I'd been raped like I did with THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS,but BELLE'S MAGICAL WORLD is still the antithesis of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Like CHRISTMAS,BMW hates its audience,although not to such an extreme degree. It's ugly,uncanonical,idiotic,and the writing is horrifically bad.None of the stories work. These are not the characters we loved from BATB at all,they're a bunch of pod people. I wanted to dissect it,but after a few minutes,I gave up,because no one in their right mind would take this claptrap seriously. What we have here are three stories. \"The Perfect Word\" is an overbearing,ponderous study of forgiveness. \"Fifi's Folly\" only works if you can accept that Babette's name is actually Fifi and that she's a closet James Bond villainess and that Lumiere is an idiot concerning women. \"Broken Wing\" (or \"Broken Wind\" as I like to call it) is probably the most heinous of the bunch. Beast hates birds? Since WHEN? Don't watch this crap- every copy of this video deserves to be cremated. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is still a cinematic classic,a transcendent celebration of love,art, intelligence and the human

{"value":"After a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside, you're pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy. Then the movie takes a turn for the worse. <br /><br />The warm feeling might still be there, but as others has said: The plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it's almost unbearable to watch. <br /><br />The movie gets sped up, and you get the impression that you're either fast forwarding through it, or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut a lot of scenes out.<br /><br />Realism isn't a goal onto itself, but as a viewer, I'm pretty convinced that this comedy isn't intentionally unrealistic, it just happens to be.<br /><br />On the plus side, this movie has a couple of nice interiors, and despite the bad script, I think that the actors performances are mainly good. If I could rate the first 25 minutes only, I'd probably give it an eight. As it is now, it gets a four. ...And that's being nice! <br /><br />If you're a sucker for romantic comedies you'll probably have a great time anyways.

{"value":"I wandered into this movie after watching the 82-minute \"Borat\" tonight, and left quite disappointed. I was a huge fan of Wallace and Gromit, and routinely go to see animated films. That being said, I found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out, but stayed waiting for this film to get better. Never happened.<br /><br />The visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch, especially in my opinion, that of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen (I had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was Gandalf and Magneto). The problem with this movie for me is it's one of those animated features for the ADD-set. It registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another, weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an \"Important Message.\" It looks a lot like busted Oscar bait for the animated category, and considering the way it's scoring with critics, I wouldn't be surprised if the Academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware.

{"value":"What is most striking about this semi-musical set in 1920s Berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing. It's top of the line from First National in these departments. The story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of Miller's other two films (SUNNY, SALLY) where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval, complications and final clinch. All the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy. Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and reprises BECAUSE OF YOU. There are also DON'T EVER BE BLUE and THOUGH YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST ONE.<br /><br />Miller here is very engaging and delightful, quite reminiscent of Irene Dunne in manner and delivery. Sad she does not dance as that is her forte. SALLY remains her finest film, with this trailing as second and the rather poor SUNNY a vastly inferior runner up. Her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable.

{"value":"Kevin Spacey is very talented, but unfortunately directing is not his forte. I had high expectations about the film before I rented it and maybe that is why I disliked it so much. I admire Spacey's attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting, but it's not the attempt that counts. I found the film dull, boring, and stretched out. The acting was nothing spectacular. Gary Sinise has done much better, especially since he is conscious in most of his other films. Skeet Ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films (I did get a kick out of how young and chubby this Scream star looked). The only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above. The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck. However, that shot was very \"Usual Suspects\"ish and my guess is Spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his (which is very good mind you). If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting, watch Hitchcock's Lifeboat. Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming
