{"value":"Like most people I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this film, especially the \"film makers were then attacked\" aspect that the case seems to emphasize, what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob.<br /><br />Then, to watch the film and discover, oh, what they mean by \"the film makers were attacked\" was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said \"Someone should beat those two kids up.\" The picture on the cover, \"the chase\" as it were? Total fabrication. Which I guess ties in with the theme of the film, lying and manipulation to satisfy vain, stupid children with more money and time then sense.<br /><br />I have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film. It's like Michael Moore's \"Roger & Me\", but if \"Roger & Me\" was Moore mocking the people of Flint. It's completely misdirected and totally inane. Wow! Can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of Communism would be really excited to have markets full of food? What jerks! And it's not so much, \"Look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah\", since it wasn't just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors, it was that, as many people in the film say, the prices were absurdly low, someone mentions that they should've known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck. That's not proving anything except that people who are poor, will go to a store that has low prices, bravo fellas, way to stick it to the people on the bottom.<br /><br />Way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people. You should be very proud. How about for your next movie you make a documentary about Iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then, say, \"HAHA! NO SUCH HOUSE EXISTS! YOUR SO STUPID AND LOVED TO BE LIED TO BY THE MEDIA!\".<br /><br />Morgan \"Please Like Me\" Spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it's no surprise since Spurlock as One Hit Wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him.<br /><br />Avoid like the

{"value":"Whatever happened to Keaton is what I want to know.<br /><br />Actually I don't, I crawled away, heaving, thinking she must owe half the bookies in Vegas, or maybe not, maybe she was just brainwashed, blackmailed and bored to death. Rich enough to adopt a third-world country, she somehow had to star in yet another cookie-cut, cliché-ridden drool'athon, based on the same character-franchise she's been rehashing since 'Father of the Bride'('91). You'd think she's going head to head with Mr.Bean.<br /><br />(Spoilers) <br /><br />So hubby (Dax) get's fired by obnoxious son of boss, his mom (Keaton)leaves his dad after classic row, and crashes over with her own dog-show in tow, oh those little rascals. Hubby's got cold-feet for diaper-duty, wifey's clock a-ticking and hey, let's toss in a space-cadet as second house-guest for good measure, all in one day because that's so funny and original. Wife gets fed up and walks away, mom leaves dad for space-cadet and the couple makes up in time for closing credits, 86 very long minutes later.<br /><br />Now if you have to have a space-cadet, he can't be devious as well, he can't scheme some excuse for his stayover, and if mom leaves dad, she can't hop into a cab dressed as a pumpkin just because some scriptwriter agonized over how to cheer thing up. <br /><br />Plus that gag whereby they invite her in only to then discover she's got her canine entourage in the cab has got to be outlawed by now. And you only get one obnoxious 2-dimensional boss to denigrate. Another movie-killer would be the movie-script the space cadet is toiling away at, supposedly more lame than the actual one, again, dejas-ad-nausea.<br /><br />Liv Tyler doesn't seem happy here, her voice was weird at times, it had me wondering if they later had her redub some of it, and she's a smart one, she's handled great roles and we'll forgive her for Jersey Girl, it was disaster-prone, could happen to anyone. Dax Shepard was watchable and that's being generous considering the material.<br /><br />Personally, it's the director, the screenwriters and especially the producers that I would love to see tar'n'feathered before shipped to Guantanamo as playthings for the prisoners, and that's me keeping this 'lite'.","finished_norm":["whatev","happen","to","keaton","be","what","i","want","to","knowbr","br","actual","i","do","not","i","crawl","awai","heav","think","she","must","ow","half","the","booki","in","vega","or","mayb","not","mayb","she","be","just","brainwash","blackmail","and","bore","to","death","rich","enough","to","adopt","a","thirdworld","countri","she","somehow","have","to","star","in","yet","anoth","cookiecut","clichéridden","drool","athon","base","on","the","same","characterfranchis","she","be","rehash","sinc","father","of","the","bride","you","have","think","she","go","head","to","head","with","mrbeanbr","br","spoiler","br","br","so","hubbi","dax","get","fire","by","obnoxi","son","of","boss","hi","mom","keatonleav","hi","dad","after","classic","row","and","crash","over","with","her","own","dogshow","in","tow","oh","that","littl","rascal","hubbi","get","coldfeet","for","diaperduti","wifei","clock","atick","and","hei","let","toss","in","a","spacecadet","a","houseguest","for","good","measur","all","in","on","dai","becaus","that","so","funni","and","origin","wife","get","fe","up","and","walk","awai","mom","leav","dad","for","spacecadet","and","the","coupl","make","up","in","time","for","close","credit","veri","long","minut","laterbr","br","now","if","you","have","to","have","a","spacecadet","he","ca","not","be","deviou","a","good","he","ca","not","scheme","some","excus","for","hi","stayov","and","if","mom","leav","dad","she","ca","not","hop","into","a","cab","dress","a","a","pumpkin","just","becaus","some","scriptwrit","agon","over","how","to","cheer","thing","up","br","br","plu","that","gag","wherebi","thei","invit","her","in","onli","to","then","discov","she","get","her","canin","entourag","in","the","cab","have","get","to","be","outlaw","by","now","and","you","onli","get","on","obnoxi","dimension","boss","to","denigr","anoth","moviekil","would","be","the","moviescript","the","space","cadet","be","toil","awai","at","supposedli","much","lame","than","the","actual","on","again","dejasadnauseabr","br","liv","tyler","doe","not","seem","happi","here","her","voic","be","weird","at","time","it","have","me","wonder","if","thei","late","have","her","redub","some","of","it","and","she","a","smart","on","she","handl","great","role","and","we","will","forgiv","her","for","jersei","girl","it","be","disasterpron","can","happen","to","anyon","dax","shepard","be","watchabl","and","that","be","gener","consid","the","materialbr","br","person","it","the","director","the","screenwrit","and","especi","the","produc","that","i","would","love","to","see","tarnfeath","befor","ship","to","guantanamo","a","playth","for","the","prison","and","that","me","keep","thi","lite"],"filtered":["whatev","happen","keaton","want","knowbr","br","actual","crawl","awai","heav","think","must","ow","half","booki","vega","mayb","mayb","brainwash","blackmail","bore","death","rich","enough","adopt","thirdworld","countri","somehow","star","yet","anoth","cookiecut","clichéridden","drool","athon","base","characterfranchis","rehash","sinc","father","bride","think","go","head","head","mrbeanbr","br","spoiler","br","br","hubbi","dax","get","fire","obnoxi","son","boss","hi","mom","keatonleav","hi","dad","classic","row","crash","dogshow","tow","oh","littl","rascal","hubbi","get","coldfeet","diaperduti","wifei","clock","atick","hei","let","toss","spacecadet","houseguest","good","measur","dai","becaus","funni","origin","wife","get","fe","walk","awai","mom","leav","dad","spacecadet","coupl","make","time","close","credit","veri","long","minut","laterbr","br","spacecadet","ca","deviou","good","ca","scheme","excus","hi","stayov","mom","leav","dad","ca","hop","cab","dress","pumpkin","becaus","scriptwrit","agon","cheer","thing","br","br","plu","gag","wherebi","thei","invit","onli","discov","get","canin","entourag","cab","get","outlaw","onli","get","obnoxi","dimension","boss","denigr","anoth","moviekil","moviescript","space","cadet","toil","awai","supposedli","much","lame","actual","dejasadnauseabr","br","liv","tyler","doe","seem","happi","voic","weird","time","wonder","thei","late","redub","smart","handl","great","role","forgiv","jersei","girl","disasterpron","happen","anyon","dax","shepard","watchabl","gener","consid","materialbr","br","person","director","screenwrit","especi","produc","love","see","tarnfeath","befor","ship","guantanamo","playth","prison","keep","thi","lite"],"filtered2":["whatev","happen","keaton","want","knowbr","actual","crawl","awai","heav","think","must","ow","half","booki","vega","mayb","mayb","brainwash","blackmail","bore","death","rich","enough","adopt","thirdworld","countri","somehow","star","yet","anoth","cookiecut","clichéridden","drool","athon","base","characterfranchis","rehash","sinc","father","bride","think","go","head","head","mrbeanbr","spoiler","hubbi","dax","get","fire","obnoxi","son","boss","mom","keatonleav","dad","classic","row","crash","dogshow","tow","oh","littl","rascal","hubbi","get","coldfeet","diaperduti","wifei",

{"value":"When Ben (Red Foxx) discovers his wife Beatrice (Pearl Bailey) has run off with his own brother, he rushes to his son Norman (Michael Warren) to unload his tale of woe--only to discover that Norman has a secret lover: the effeminate Garson (Dennis Dugan.) Needless to say, Ben does not take it well, and numerous complications follow--including Ben's attempt to get Norman over being homosexual by fixing him up with a hooker (Tammy Dobson.) Unfortunately, this description of the movie sounds a great deal more entertaining than the movie itself.<br /><br />Originally written for the theatre by Ron Clark and Sam Bobrick, NORMAN... IS THAT YOU? was an absolute disaster on the New York stage. To give the play its due, I actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theatre production--and while no one would accuse it of being anything other than a shallow farce, the cast played so broadly and in such drop-dead manner that it proved quite amusing. It is a pity the cast of this film didn't do the same.<br /><br />This is an atrociously performed motion picture. Red Foxx, one of the most hilarious comics of the 20th century, is about as funny here as yesterday's wash, Michael Warren (who later appeared on the television series HILL STREET BLUES to much better effect) competes with Foxx to see who can give the worst performance, and Pearl Bailey is not far behind; truth be told, only Dennis Duggan, Tammy Dobson, and a cameo by Wayland Flowers have any spark--and sadly, that is only in comparison with the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Not only is the film badly performed, it looks bad. According to film lore, this was the first big screen effort to be filmed in videotape, which was then transfered to celluloid for project purposes--and believe me, it shows. The film has the look of a bad 1970s sitcom right down to the painted skyline seen through the windows of Norman and Garson's apartment.<br /><br />Some films are so bad that they become funny, but NORMAN... IS THAT YOU? isn't one of them. I can sum up my reaction to this film in two words: miss it. Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't touch it with a ten foot pole. Just back away slowly and then run like hell.<br /><br />Gary F.

{"value":"Now I'll be the first to admit it when I say something that may be blasphemous or unfair, so I would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much I disliked this movie.<br /><br />That about sums it up too. I disliked this movie. To be more specific, I disliked the concept of this movie. The cinematography was good. The mood was nice. And the acting was satisfactory.<br /><br /> However, the story is fatuous, unacurate and misleading. It is also offensive.<br /><br />I am a quarter Cree Indian, and for some reason I feel insulted, on a personal level, by the nature of Whitaker's character. First of all, he's a black guy. And this isn't a racist remark, I swear. The thought of a White, Hispanic or even Native American swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents. The katana represents the soul of a Samurai, imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the Samurai. For Ghost Dog to use his guns instead of the Katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside, and where the heck did he get a Katana anyway? It must be one of those replicas, which insults the Samurai caste even more.<br /><br />Also, Ghost Dog showed no honor. Near the end of the movie, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain. Not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy, it's more like a ninjas way; silent assassins; a group that samurais deny exists, but hates none-the-less.<br /><br />Then he tries to kill his boss, when he finds out his boss is a baddie. You know what a true Samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable? He kills himself, to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master.<br /><br />Everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all Samurai adhere to: Bushido.<br /><br />So, we have great cinematography, good ambiance and so-so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise, (which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it) , making it an unsatisfactory overall film, and an insult to everything a honorable bushi(samurai) holds dear.<br /><br /> 2.5/10

{"value":"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Ray (Ray Winstone) has a criminal past, has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife Valerie (Kathy Burke) who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat. Meanwhile, her mother Janet (Laila Morse) is aware of Ray's son, Billy (Charlie Creed-Miles) and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails. The film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives.<br /><br />It is said that the British seem to enjoy being miserable, and that would include watching films that entertain them this way. Films like Nil by Mouth highlight this. It's a tale of a broken family, torn apart by crime, poverty, booze and drugs, the kind Jeremy Kyle would lap up like a three course meal. It is also essentially a tale of self destructive men, three generations apart and each copying the other, tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together, despite not being strong enough. If you pick up a little of what it's about from the off-set, you can see it doesn't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn't disappoint in this.<br /><br />It's true what everyone said about the performances, and the lead stars, Winstone and Burke, do deliver some great acting. We see Winstone lose it with his wife, beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia, breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid. Likewise, in a private moment, we see Burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase, the full impact of the night before kicking in.<br /><br />This is another of those films where there's no 'plot' to follow, as such, just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next. It's been acclaimed by many (including the Baftas!) but it really was just too grim and bleak for me. I have no right to criticize it for this, knowing what I knew about it from the off-set, but sadly this is how I found it.

{"value":"It must be assumed that those who praised this film (\"the greatest filmed opera ever,\" didn't I read somewhere?) either don't care for opera, don't care for Wagner, or don't care about anything except their desire to appear Cultured. Either as a representation of Wagner's swan-song, or as a movie, this strikes me as an unmitigated disaster, with a leaden reading of the score matched to a tricksy, lugubrious realisation of the text.<br /><br />It's questionable that people with ideas as to what an opera (or, for that matter, a play, especially one by Shakespeare) is \"about\" should be allowed anywhere near a theatre or film studio; Syberberg, very fashionably, but without the smallest justification from Wagner's text, decided that Parsifal is \"about\" bisexual integration, so that the title character, in the latter stages, transmutes into a kind of beatnik babe, though one who continues to sing high tenor -- few if any of the actors in the film are the singers, and we get a double dose of Armin Jordan, the conductor, who is seen as the face (but not heard as the voice) of Amfortas, and also appears monstrously in double exposure as a kind of Batonzilla or Conductor Who Ate Monsalvat during the playing of the Good Friday music -- in which, by the way, the transcendant loveliness of nature is represented by a scattering of shopworn and flaccid crocuses stuck in ill-laid turf, an expedient which baffles me. In the theatre we sometimes have to piece out such imperfections with our thoughts, but I can't think why Syberberg couldn't splice in, for Parsifal and Gurnemanz, mountain pasture as lush as was provided for Julie Andrews in Sound of Music...<br /><br />The sound is hard to endure, the high voices and the trumpets in particular possessing an aural glare that adds another sort of fatigue to our impatience with the uninspired conducting and paralytic unfolding of the ritual. Someone in another review mentioned the 1951 Bayreuth recording, and Knappertsbusch, though his tempi are often very slow, had what Jordan altogether lacks, a sense of pulse, a feeling for the ebb and flow of the music -- and, after half a century, the orchestral sound in that set, in modern pressings, is still superior to this film.","finished_norm":["it","must","be","assum","that","that","who","prais","thi","film","the","great","film","opu","ever","do","not","i","read","somewher","either","do","not","care","for","opu","do","not","care","for","wagner","or","do","not","care","about","anyth","except","their","desir","to","appear","cultur","either","a","a","represent","of","wagner","swansong","or","a","a","movi","thi","strike","me","a","a","unmitig","disast","with","a","leaden","read","of","the","score","match","to","a","tricksi","lugubri","realis","of","the","textbr","br","it","question","that","peopl","with","idea","a","to","what","a","opu","or","for","that","matt","a","plai","especi","on","by","shakespear","be","about","should","be","allow","anywher","near","a","theatr","or","film","studio","syberberg","veri","fashion","but","without","the","small","justif","from","wagner","text","decid","that","parsif","be","about","bisexu","integr","so","that","the","titl","charact","in","the","latter","stage","transmut","into","a","kind","of","beatnik","babe","though","on","who","continu","to","sing","high","tenor","few","if","ani","of","the","actor","in","the","film","be","the","singer","and","we","get","a","doubl","dose","of","armin","jordan","the","conductor","who","be","see","a","the","face","but","not","hear","a","the","voic","of","amforta","and","conjur","appear","monstrous","in","doubl","exposur","a","a","kind","of","batonzilla","or","conductor","who","eat","monsalvat","dure","the","plai","of","the","good","fridai","music","in","which","by","the","wai","the","transcend","loveli","of","natur","be","repres","by","a","scatter","of","shopworn","and","flaccid","crocu","stick","in","illlaid","turf","a","expedi","which","baffl","me","in","the","theatr","we","sometim","have","to","piec","out","such","imperfect","with","our","thought","but","i","ca","not","think","why","syberberg","can","not","splice","in","for","parsif","and","gurnemanz","mountain","pastur","a","lush","a","be","provid","for","juli","andrew","in","sound","of","musicbr","br","the","sound","be","hard","to","endur","the","high","voic","and","the","trumpet","in","particular","possess","a","aural","glare","that","add","anoth","sort","of","fatigu","to","our","impati","with","the","uninspir","conduct","and","paralyt","unfold","of","the","ritual","someon","in","anoth","review","mention","the","bayreuth","record","and","knappertsbusch","though","hi","tempu","be","often","veri","slow","have","what","jordan","altogeth","lack","a","sens","of","puls","a","feel","for","the","ebb","and","flow","of","the","music","and","after","half","a","centuri","the","orchestr","sound","in","that","set","in","modern","press","be","still","superior","to","thi","film"],"filtered":["must","assum","prais","thi","film","great","film","opu","ever","read","somewher","either","care","opu","care","wagner","care","anyth","except","desir","appear","cultur","either","represent","wagner","swansong","movi","thi","strike","unmitig","disast","leaden","read","score","match","tricksi","lugubri","realis","textbr","br","question","peopl","idea","opu","matt","plai","especi","shakespear","allow","anywher","near","theatr","film","studio","syberberg","veri","fashion","without","small","justif","wagner","text","decid","parsif","bisexu","integr","titl","charact","latter","stage","transmut","kind","beatnik","babe","though","continu","sing","high","tenor","ani","actor","film","singer","get","doubl","dose","armin","jordan","conductor","see","face","hear","voic","amforta","conjur","appear","monstrous","doubl","exposur","kind","batonzilla","conductor","eat","monsalvat","dure","plai","good","fridai","music","wai","transcend","loveli","natur","repres","scatter","shopworn","flaccid","crocu","stick","illlaid","turf","expedi","baffl","theatr","sometim","piec","imperfect","thought","ca","think","syberberg","splice","parsif","gurnemanz","mountain","pastur","lush","provid","juli","andrew","sound","musicbr","br","sound","hard","endur","high","voic","trumpet","particular","possess","aural","glare","add","anoth","sort","fatigu","impati","uninspir","conduct","paralyt","unfold","ritual","someon","anoth","review","mention","bayreuth","record","knappertsbusch","though","hi","tempu","often","veri","slow","jordan","altogeth","lack","sens","puls","feel","ebb","flow","music","half","centuri","orchestr","sound","set","modern","press","still","superior","thi","film"],"filtered2":["must","assum","prais","great","opu","ever","read","somewher","either","care","opu","care","wagner","care","anyth","except","desir","appear","cultur","either","represent","wagner","swansong","strike","unmitig","disast","leaden","read","score","match","tricksi","lugubri","realis","textbr","question","peopl","idea","opu","matt","plai","especi","shakespear","allow","anywher","near","theatr","studio","syberberg","veri","fashion","without","small","justif","wagner","text","decid","parsif","bisexu","integr","titl","charact","latter","stage","transmut","kind","beatnik","babe","though","cont

{"value":"The London Underground has something inherently creepy about it, with its long winding tunnels, the escalators taking you deeper and deeper underground, and of course the rats roaming the tracks.It a source of wonder that it is not used in horror films more often. It was used in the seventies horror Deathline aka Raw Meat, featuring a cannibalistic tribe living in a disused tunnel, and the celebrated chase sequence in American Werewolf in London. So I was pleased to see that someone else had tried to capitalise on the atmosphere of the tube at night with the recent UK production Creep.<br /><br />I thought the film started off well, with a highly effective credit sequence that was genuinely unnerving, followed by a scene in the sewers that sets up the premise of there being something evil lurking below the streets of London. However, Creep went downhill from here, and I found myself wishing that I'd switched it off after this opening scene, leaving me with a favourable impression of the film. All the characters become unsympathetic and unlikable, even Potente herself, and the director felt the need to hit us over the head with social commentary about homelessness. he also made the mistake of showing the \"monster\" in full lighting, where he ceases to become remotely scary, and reveals his name to be Craig. How can you have a monster called Craig? It turns into an X Files-type thing, and reminds one of the episode Tombs. In fact, I was wishing Mulder and Scully would turn up and sort them all out for me.<br /><br />As for the infamous sexualised violence, it is very graphic, disturbing and totally unnecessary. It seems to be there merely to shock the audience rather than for any intrinsic plot value. The trouble is it is so over the top and horrific that it actually numbs you to the rest of the horror, which is a mistake as it's only halfway through the film.<br /><br />So there you go. The only redeeming feature of the film for me was a rare appearance from Ken Campbell, one of my favourite occasional actors. You don't see him very often, but when he's on screen he acts everyone else into a corner. Casting him as a sewer inspector was a stroke of genius, unfortunately the only one evident in the

{"value":"Final Score: 1.8 (out of 10)<br /><br />After seeing 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' I must have been on a big Eliza Dushku kick when I rented this movie. 'Soul Survivors' is a junk \"psychological thriller\" dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick - even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up-and-comers like Dushku, Wes Bentley (American Beauty), Casey Affleck (Drowning Mona) and likable star Melissa Sagemiller. Luke Wilson is also in there, ridiculously miscast as a priest. The movie, the brainchild of writer/director Stephen Carpenter, seems like a mutant offspring of 'Open Your Eyes' or 'Vanilla Sky' and movies where a character (and the audience) is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accident/death. The movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved. I don't think these movies are that entertaining- by their very nature- to begin with, but 'SS' is rock-bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it. The visuals, the script, the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this. Plus, it's PG-13 so it doesn't even deliver the gore or T&A to sustain it as a guilty pleasure (even the unrated version is tame). I had heard that the movie contained some \"hot\" shower scene between Dushku & Sagemiller. As the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost I found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene - at least I would get something out of this. Then it comes: the two girls get paint on their shirts, they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off. That's it. People thought this was hot? 'Soul Survivors' is one of those drop-dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have ANY feelings at all toward it. It puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about. In the end it leaves us empty. Carpenter's finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and that's probably the most lively part. It will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on USA or the Sci-Fi Channel, due to it's low cost and PG-13 rating - and that's probably best for

{"value":"As others have mentioned, this movie is similar to THE FLY (both versions) and the lesser known sci-fi flick ALTERED STATES. The big difference is that those two movies were well made by people who knew what they were doing and were good at it. METAMORPHOSIS did not have these advantages. METAMORPHOSIS is a potentially interesting science fantasy story that had the wrong people in charge of it and the wrong actors playing the roles.<br /><br />The story follows scientist Dr. Peter Houseman (Gene LeBrock), an obsessed man working on a genetic cure to aging and death. When the university he works for threatens to cut funding, he decides to inject the anti-aging serum into himself. As a result, Dr. Houseman spends the rest of the movie slowly turning into a lizard. And oh yes, watching the good doctor go through the process of becoming that lizard is a great joy. It really is so bad that it's good. Some of the lines are classic: \"What WAS it?\" \"A nightmare...from the past!\"<br /><br />Many of the reviews that I've read for this point up how stupid and ridiculous the last five minutes of this movie are. I'm just going to go ahead and spoil it: the good doctor goes from being a shuffling half-man, half-lizard thing to being what appears to be a man in a rejected Godzilla costume, when the police finally gun him down. In the final scene, some obnoxious kid is seen with a little pet lizard which he claims will never die, and the movie's heroine, Sally Donnelly (Catherine Baranov) evidently decides that the little lizard is the final incarnation of Dr. Houseman. The camera then gives us a close-up of the lizard's face; this is, I assume, the director's way of showing us that the lizard is EVIL. Yes, it is goofy, but I fell over laughing so I can't complain.<br /><br />I watched this movie because it was a part of the Chilling Classics 50 Movie Megapack that I purchased. I'm sure many of those who are reading this did exactly the same thing, as the 50 pack is the only way to see this movie on DVD. If you have recently bought the boxed set and haven't watched this movie yet, it really is worth your time, even if I did just ruin the ending for you. It might also be possible to find this movie online for

{"value":"I'm studying Catalan, and was delighted to find El Mar, a movie with mostly Catalan dialogue, at my art-house video store.<br /><br />Hmmm... not so delighted to have seen it.<br /><br />Yes, as other reviewers have said, it's well-made, and beautifully photographed. Although the opening sequence of the children is shockingly violent, it's well-acted and convincing. (For the most part, that is... Would the Mallorquins strip a corpse in preparation for burial right in the middle of the town square, in full view of the dead man's 10-year-old boy?) Oh, well... minor detail. Up to this point, it had something of the feel of a non-magical Pan's Labyrinth, also set in the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />Fast-forward, and the three children who survived the opening incident have come of age. Francisca is a nun working at a tuberculosis sanatorium and the two boys, Manuel and Ramallo, both are patients. I know, but hey, coincidences happen.<br /><br />The problem, as with so many Spanish movies (apologies to Almodovar fans), is that with one exception (Francisca) the characters are just so dang *weird*. Their motivations, personalities, and dialogue are often simply incoherent.<br /><br />What's more, it descends into some horrific wretched excess. Be prepared for LOTS of pain and LOTS of blood. The reviewer who called it a \"potboiler\" is quite on track. If it had been made 40 years ago, the poster would've said: SEE FORBIDDEN LOVE!! RAPE!! MURDER!! MUTILATION!! FANATICISM!! ANIMAL CRUELTY!! BETRAYAL!! <br /><br />The opening sequence is not nearly enough to make the personalities and relationships of the characters believable. To work, this should have had multiple flashbacks to flesh out the characters. As it is, it seems a bizarre and depressing cross between \"Brother Sun, Sister Moon\" and \"Pulp Fiction.\" If that sounds like something you've got to see, by all means, enjoy. I think I go with something that doesn't make me feel I need to take a shower to wash off the gore and gloom.<br /><br />As for the Catalan, it's the Mallorqui dialect, fairly different than the Barcelona dialect, though I was surprised by the comment that said that even Barcelonans apparently needed Catalan subtitles to understand it.","finished_norm":["i","be","studi","catalan","and","be","delight","to","find","el","mar","a","movi","with","mostli","catalan","dialogu","at","my","arthous","video","storebr","br","hmmm","not","so","delight","to","have","see","itbr","br","ye","a","other","review","have","sai","it","wellmad","and","beautifulli","photograph","although","the","open","sequenc","of","the","child","be","shockingli","violent","it","wellact","and","convinc","for","the","much","part","that","be","would","the","mallorquin","strip","a","corps","in","prepar","for","burial","right","in","the","middl","of","the","town","squar","in","full","view","of","the","dead","man","yearold","boi","oh","good","minor","detail","up","to","thi","point","it","have","someth","of","the","feel","of","a","nonmag","pan","labyrinth","conjur","set","in","the","spanish","civil","warbr","br","fastforward","and","the","three","child","who","surviv","the","open","incid","have","come","of","ag","francisca","be","a","nun","work","at","a","tuberculosi","sanatorium","and","the","two","boi","manuel","and","ramallo","both","be","patient","i","know","but","hei","coincid","happenbr","br","the","problem","a","with","so","mani","spanish","movi","apologi","to","almodovar","fan","be","that","with","on","except","francisca","the","charact","be","just","so","dang","weird","their","motiv","person","and","dialogu","be","often","simpli","incoherentbr","br","what","much","it","descend","into","some","horrif","wretch","excess","be","prepar","for","lot","of","pain","and","lot","of","blood","the","review","who","call","it","a","potboil","be","quit","on","track","if","it","have","be","make","year","ago","the","poster","would","have","sai","see","forbid","love","rape","murder","mutil","fanatic","anim","cruelti","betray","br","br","the","open","sequenc","be","not","nearli","enough","to","make","the","person","and","relationship","of","the","charact","believ","to","work","thi","should","have","have","multipl","flashback","to","flesh","out","the","charact","a","it","be","it","seem","a","bizarr","and","depress","cross","between","brother","sun","sister","moon","and","pulp","fiction","if","that","sound","like","someth","you","have","get","to","see","by","all","mean","enjoi","i","think","i","go","with","someth","that","doe","not","make","me","feel","i","ne","to","take","a","shower","to","wash","off","the","gore","and","gloombr","br","a","for","the","catalan","it","the","mallorqui","dialect","fairli","differ","than","the","barcelona","dialect","though","i","be","surpris","by","the","comment","that","sai","that","even","barcelonan","appar","ne","catalan","subtitl","to","understand","it"],"filtered":["studi","catalan","delight","find","el","mar","movi","mostli","catalan","dialogu","arthous","video","storebr","br","hmmm","delight","see","itbr","br","ye","review","sai","wellmad","beautifulli","photograph","although","open","sequenc","child","shockingli","violent","wellact","convinc","much","part","mallorquin","strip","corps","prepar","burial","right","middl","town","squar","full","view","dead","man","yearold","boi","oh","good","minor","detail","thi","point","someth","feel","nonmag","pan","labyrinth","conjur","set","spanish","civil","warbr","br","fastforward","three","child","surviv","open","incid","come","ag","francisca","nun","work","tuberculosi","sanatorium","two","boi","manuel","ramallo","patient","know","hei","coincid","happenbr","br","problem","mani","spanish","movi","apologi","almodovar","fan","except","francisca","charact","dang","weird","motiv","person","dialogu","often","simpli","incoherentbr","br","much","descend","horrif","wretch","excess","prepar","lot","pain","lot","blood","review","call","potboil","quit","track","make","year","ago","poster","sai","see","forbid","love","rape","murder","mutil","fanatic","anim","cruelti","betray","br","br","open","sequenc","nearli","enough","make","person","relationship","charact","believ","work","thi","multipl","flashback","flesh","charact","seem","bizarr","depress","cross","brother","sun","sister","moon","pulp","fiction","sound","like","someth","get","see","mean","enjoi","think","go","someth","doe","make","feel","ne","take","shower","wash","gore","gloombr","br","catalan","mallorqui","dialect","fairli","differ","barcelona","dialect","though","surpris","comment","sai","even","barcelonan","appar","ne","catalan","subtitl","understand"],"filtered2":["studi","catalan","delight","find","el","mar","mostli","catalan","dialogu","arthous","video","storebr","hmmm","delight","see","itbr","ye","review","wellmad","beautifulli","photograph","although","open","sequenc","child","shockingli","violent","wellact","convinc","part","mallorquin","strip","corps","prepar","burial","right","middl","town","squar","full","view","dead","man","yearold","boi","oh","good","minor","detail","point","someth","feel","nonmag","pan","labyrinth","conjur","set","spanish","civil","warbr","fastforward","three","child","surviv","open","incid","come","ag","francisca","nun","work","tuberculosi"

{"value":"Watching Floored by Love one thought comes almost immediately to mind, \"My god this looks like a really bad sitcom.\" Sure enough, it turns out that FBL is a pilot for a series that may start this fall in Canada, poor poor Canada.<br /><br />Cara (Shirley Ng) and Janet (Natalie Sky) are a lesbian couple living in Vancouver. Janet has come out to her mother already but Cara's parents are still in the dark about their daughter's homosexuality. The pressure is on to out herself though when the parents come from Malaysia for her younger brother's wedding. That same week British Columbia legalizes gay marriage. With Janet wanting to wed, Cara has to decide whether or not to tell her conservative Chinese parents that's she's gay. Will she? Would she? Could she? Cara's situation is contrasted with that of Jesse (Trent Millar). Jesse has just declared his homosexuality to the world at the age of fourteen. His biological father Daniel (Andrew McIlroy) is coming for a visit soon. His stepfather Norman (Michael Robinson) fears that his chances of finally being fully accepted by Jesse are harmed by the fact that Daniel is gay and he is not. Will dialing 1-800-Makeover help?<br /><br />The dialogue and delivery come straight out of a lesser 1950's program along with the overdone physical emoting. The Full House-style melodrama is enough to make you wince from time to time and the attempts at comedy largely fail. McIlroy, Millar & Sky are the only performers that approach competency in this miscalculation but given the material they have to work with, it's no surprise that none impress. It's possible that the campiness was purposeful. It often seems like there is no way the performers are really that bad, that they must be trying to mimic the inferior sitcoms of days yore. If this is indeed the case than this review should probably be rewritten. The rewrite would focus on Floored by Love being a poor and ineffective send-up of old sitcoms.<br /><br />Writer/director Desiree Lim has put together a by-the-numbers bland-fest that's entirely forgettable. There was a time when merely having an openly homosexual protagonist was enough to make a mark on the screen. That time is gone. In this day we need quality as

{"value":"I suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early Sofia Loren film. She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953.<br /><br />I viewed this film because I wanted to see some of Sofia Loren's early work. I was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Surely, today, this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making. It actually became annoying watching Ms. Loren in skin color paint throughout the film.<br /><br />Yes, this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie. Then, the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent. I discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weight.<br /><br />As beautiful as Ms. Loren was at age 19 and still is today, the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage. After all, we don't see beautiful young people on stage with \"old opera singers\" back stage singing from behind the curtain! Do not discount the success of using heavy-weight opera singers. One only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the J. G. Wentworth Company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the company's product. This is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials produced to date.<br /><br />The quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality. The color ink has faded much and that can not be helped.<br /><br />To improve this film on DVD the production company should add English language subtitles so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the lyrics are saying. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenes.<br /><br />Watch this film not because of the story of Aida nor the fact that this is an opera. Aside from Ms. Sofia Loren none of her co-actors are known nor remembered by this writer. Instead, watch this movie if you are a fan of Ms. Loren and wish to see her at age 19 -- no matter what the production is.<br /><br />Larry from

{"value":"I feel like I've been had, the con is on, don't fall for it. After reading glowing reviews (the Director was a film reviewer with Sky for years so must have a lot of mates in the press ready to do him a favour by writing favorable reviews) I expected solid acting, atmosphere, suspense, strong characterization, an intriguing plot development and poetic moments. Sadly, 'Sixteen years of Alcohol', doesn't deliver on the critics promises, for the most part, sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects (what was that clichéd cobweb scene in there for?), unrealistic fight choreography and mindless mind numbing narration, cliché edits and camera angles.<br /><br />'Sixteen years of Alcohol' starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in Scotland, but it's straight downhill from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time building atmosphere, creating characters we might care about, or building suspense - the director opts to begin driving you crazy with self indulgent heavy handed twaddle voice-over's. The lead characters are so unsympathetic and are so badly acted - the audience doesn't care what happens to them, desperate Actors do desperate things...like this movie!. To make matters worse, the 'homage's' (typical of a director trying to pay his dues to past masters) are either utterly cliché or unconvincing. The soundtrack is the only thing that lifted me and kept me in the cinema but even that failed to support the dramatic narrative other connecting a period of time to the action.<br /><br />For some reason the movie got increasingly flawed and to be quite honest annoying. I still watched the whole damn thing!<br /><br />I guess I liked the attempt at gritty realism in the film but even that was destroyed when they were often inter-cut with weird and abstract, sometimes pointless scenes. You don't need a huge budget to make truly moving film, so much has been said about how little money they had to make this film, half a million is not a little bit of money...SO NO EXCUSES! Sometimes I wonder what the actors...Or their agents were thinking!<br /><br />Pass on this turkey unless you're masochistic or mindless anyway....NOT MY THING<br /><br

{"value":"I just rented and watched this movie just to see what's all the fuss about. So here's what my reactions to it are. It's easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors. The main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists. This concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film. However, the movie doesn't shock or disturb me at all. It just bored me. This movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes. All lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time, like those scenery scenes and some scenes I described below.<br /><br />************Contains spoiler************ I find the rape scenes quite tame. I don't know if I have watched the cut or uncut version, if there is actually such a version. I also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot. Here's a list on top of my mind.<br /><br />Why don't the rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are. That would be an excellent time.<br /><br />Why don't they just gang rape her, instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening Jennifer's ordeal by such a long time. It would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way.<br /><br />I found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house. Maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles.<br /><br />These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right, they shouldn't send a coward imbecile to do the job.<br /><br />Why didn't Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left?

{"value":"Walerian Borowczyks La Bete (1975) was obviously received in different ways: Some were appalled, some were shocked others applauded the courage. I however am completely untouched, bored and cannot stop asking myself why the display of incoherent, inconsistent images which vaguely orbit around a central theme are considered an intellectual journey.<br /><br />What was this movie actually about? Growing sexuality in a woman? I've seen great films on this subject, but this is not one of them. How can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream (in the nude) of beasts. Where there are no characters, there is no character study. The woman persecuted by the beast was not adolescent, the girl having sex with the black butler (is he also characterized as a beast?) has a very grown up attitude to sexuality, so where is the consistency? Is it a movie about religion? If yes we would need a bit more thematic material than a priest without function, character and charisma, but with a strong desire towards two young boys.<br /><br />Is it about bestiality? The metaphoric feel of the movie forbids any realistic examination of bestiality, especially as realistic examination requires realistic characters. So no real bestiality here. Some mythic beast and two priests talking to each other about the sin of bestiality. Enough for a college essay on the topic? I don't think so.<br /><br />Is it about sex? Is it about anything? I don't know. I only know that showing a fired gun doesn't make a film a war movie. Dealing with a topic must mean more than displaying its own associations with the theme.<br /><br />So look across the controversy. Don't be scared by the bestiality, nudity, ejaculations, masturbation and stuff. I am not. Look at it as you look at any other story and you might discover that this is a poorly made, poorly edited, poorly acted, really poorly written (okay, some pictures are quite nice, and the main character is a really good looking girl) cerebral masturbation of a director who thinks beating around the bush in a hypnotic slow manner will make a story intelligent.

{"value":"In what would be his first screenplay, based on his own short story \"Turn About,\" William Faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty, sacrifice, and really strange relationships. The story originally was about only the Tone, Young, and Cooper characters, but MGM needed to put Joan Crawford in another picture to fulfill her contract, and Faulkner obliged by creating a female role. Crawford insisted that her lines be written in the same clipped style as her co-stars' Young and Tone, leading to much unintentional hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph-like shorthand that sounds like a Monty Python sketch (\"Wuthering Heights\" performed in semaphore). Seriously, the almost entirely pronoun-less sentences make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James.<br /><br />The film also reflects some familiar Faulkner themes, with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister (as may be found in his \"Sanctuary,\" and elsewhere). When Young proposes to Crawford, in Tone's presence, in lieu of an engagement ring ALL THREE exchange their childhood engraved rings with one another. The closeness of Tone and Young is also noticeable, especially as they go off to their Thelma & Louise fate. Frankly, it's creepy.<br /><br />Not as creepy to this New Yorker, however, as the recurring theme of the massive cockroach, Wellington, which Crawford cheerfully catches (and which is shown gamboling over her hands--I had to turn away!) and Young turns into a gladiator. Blech.<br /><br />That being said, there are some nice performances. Young is particularly engaging in a scene where he's taken up in Cooper's fighter plane, and Roscoe Karns is delightful as Cooper's flying buddy. Tone, despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue, has a nice moment, dashing away his own furtive tears over his buddy Young's fate. Crawford, stripped of meaningful dialogue as well, mostly comes across as either wooden or melodramatic, which is quite a balancing act for one role.<br /><br />The battle scenes--not surprisingly, for a Howard Hawks film--are the most exciting part of the entire picture.

{"value":"I've read reviews that apparently you have to have been a student in a very strict, British school in the 1960's to understand this. Maybe that's true, if so, then this movie is outdated.<br /><br />*************SPOILER ALERT**************************************** The ending makes about as much sense as all the kids who're anti-government and anti-corporation without having any better solution that doesn't torch society to a Mad Max type cinder.<br /><br />Yeah, the main characters could leave, but they don't. The reasons they go about this don't make sense. There isn't enough character development to explain why. What shooting up a bunch of innocent people is supposed to mean is never explained or even hinted at. It is mentioned that war is the final creative expression, quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have, and it makes no sense.<br /><br />The characters who go on a murder spree aren't fighting the institution, they're just killing people. I thought they might've used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end, that would've made greater symbolic sense, but they didn't.<br /><br />tl;dr - This movie is an adolescent's daydream of fighting against authority that plagues them, though in reality they need. It has no moral, symbolic truth, or meaning to it; this movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in \"power\" that annoy you.<br /><br />If you think a murder rampage/ school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you don't like, then I guess you'll love this movie. If you're like me and you're working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly (very blindly in this movie) rebelling against \"the man\", this movie is juvenile and boring.<br /><br />You can also tell in parts that funding was lacking, and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorder.<br /><br />All in all, this seems like a very rough draft of what could've been an okay movie, but no effort is put into the dialogue, character development, or moral so it's just... poorly done.<br /><br />If... only I could get my two hours back.","finished_norm":["i","have","read","review","that","appar","you","have","to","have","be","a","student","in","a","veri","strict","british","school","in","the","to","understand","thi","mayb","that","true","if","so","then","thi","movi","be","outdatedbr","br","spoiler","alert","the","end","make","about","a","much","sens","a","all","the","kid","who","re","antigovern","and","anticorpor","without","have","ani","well","solut","that","doe","not","torch","societi","to","a","mad","max","typ","cinderbr","br","ye","the","main","charact","can","leav","but","thei","do","not","the","reason","thei","go","about","thi","do","not","make","sens","there","be","not","enough","charact","develop","to","explain","why","what","shoot","up","a","bunch","of","innoc","peopl","be","suppos","to","mean","be","never","explain","or","even","hint","at","it","be","mention","that","war","be","the","final","creativ","express","quit","possibli","the","onli","revel","that","ani","charact","of","thi","movi","have","and","it","make","no","sensebr","br","the","charact","who","go","on","a","murder","spree","be","not","fight","the","institut","thei","re","just","kill","peopl","i","think","thei","mai","have","us","all","the","explos","to","blow","up","the","place","or","at","littl","the","sanctuari","at","the","end","that","would","have","make","great","symbol","sens","but","thei","didntbr","br","tldr","thi","movi","be","a","adolesc","daydream","of","fight","against","author","that","plagu","them","though","in","realiti","thei","ne","it","have","no","moral","symbol","truth","or","mean","to","it","thi","movi","simpli","plai","out","the","fantasi","of","kill","teacher","and","peopl","in","power","that","annoi","youbr","br","if","you","think","a","murder","rampag","school","shoot","similar","to","columbin","or","virginia","tech","be","a","ration","and","sensibl","wai","to","deal","with","teacher","and","institut","you","do","not","like","then","i","guess","you","will","love","thi","movi","if","you","re","like","me","and","you","re","work","toward","make","a","life","for","yourself","instead","of","just","blindli","veri","blindli","in","thi","movi","rebel","against","the","man","thi","movi","be","juvenil","and","boringbr","br","you","can","conjur","tell","in","part","that","fund","be","lack","and","the","stori","seem","to","have","a","touch","of","attent","deficit","disorderbr","br","all","in","all","thi","seem","like","a","veri","rough","draft","of","what","can","have","be","a","okai","movi","but","no","effort","be","put","into","the","dialogu","charact","develop","or","moral","so","it","just","poorli","donebr","br","if","onli","i","can","get","my","two","hour","back"],"filtered":["read","review","appar","student","veri","strict","british","school","understand","thi","mayb","true","thi","movi","outdatedbr","br","spoiler","alert","end","make","much","sens","kid","re","antigovern","anticorpor","without","ani","well","solut","doe","torch","societi","mad","max","typ","cinderbr","br","ye","main","charact","leav","thei","reason","thei","go","thi","make","sens","enough","charact","develop","explain","shoot","bunch","innoc","peopl","suppos","mean","never","explain","even","hint","mention","war","final","creativ","express","quit","possibli","onli","revel","ani","charact","thi","movi","make","sensebr","br","charact","go","murder","spree","fight","institut","thei","re","kill","peopl","think","thei","mai","us","explos","blow","place","littl","sanctuari","end","make","great","symbol","sens","thei","didntbr","br","tldr","thi","movi","adolesc","daydream","fight","author","plagu","though","realiti","thei","ne","moral","symbol","truth","mean","thi","movi","simpli","plai","fantasi","kill","teacher","peopl","power","annoi","youbr","br","think","murder","rampag","school","shoot","similar","columbin","virginia","tech","ration","sensibl","wai","deal","teacher","institut","like","guess","love","thi","movi","re","like","re","work","toward","make","life","instead","blindli","veri","blindli","thi","movi","rebel","man","thi","movi","juvenil","boringbr","br","conjur","tell","part","fund","lack","stori","seem","touch","attent","deficit","disorderbr","br","thi","seem","like","veri","rough","draft","okai","movi","effort","put","dialogu","charact","develop","moral","poorli","donebr","br","onli","get","two","hour","back"],"filtered2":["read","review","appar","student","veri","strict","british","school","understand","mayb","true","outdatedbr","spoiler","alert","end","make","sens","kid","re","antigovern","anticorpor","without","ani","well","solut","doe","torch","societi","mad","max","typ","cinderbr","ye","main","charact","leav","reason","go","make","sens","enough","charact","develop","explain","shoot","bunch","innoc","peopl","suppos","mean","never","explain","even","hint","mention","war","final","creativ","express","quit","possibli","onli","revel","ani","charact","make","sensebr","charact","go","murder","spree","fight","institut","re","kill","peopl","think","mai","us","explos","blow",

{"value":"Years have gone by since Don Wilson used his martial arts expertise to take down a robot who was programmed to destroy him, he's also married to the blonde reporter (Stacie Foster) who led the rebellion in the first film, now a new conspiracy is in the works, one that involves look-alike droids who frame our two heroes, and a corporation looking to rule the world (There is no plot to back any of this up) and Cyber Tracker 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie. I admit that I have bought DVDs from the bargain bin that were made by PM, PM was a company that specialized in cheap-jack action flicks (like this) which had tons of explosions, little story and overall nothing but mean edged action. Some of these titles have been (mildly) enjoyable (Last Man Standing and The Sweeper) however Cyber Tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma-less Don Wilson. When comparing the protagonists of similar PM efforts both Jeff Wincott and C. Thomas Howell are Oscar nominees when compared to Don Wilson. Another telling sign is that this was directed by Richard Pepin who has none of the flair Joseph Merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets. Then again though both C. Thomas and Wincott are probably more expensive to obtain. Cyber Tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol R, there are so many steals from better movies (Robocop, Terminator, Universal Soldier to even Halloween III!) that it's almost as if Richard Pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action, Cyber Tracker 2 falls flat. There is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact. The only exception comes from Tony Burton who is miles better than the material. Also Stacie Foster looks like she could be better with far better material. However Cyber Tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy, bland and lackluster as its leading man, however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on, all there is, is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here.<br /><br />*1/2 out of

{"value":"I disagree with much that has been written and said about this supposed \"masterpiece\" of the German New Wave: <br /><br />1) There are major flaws in simple exposition, in the basic communication of critical plot points, as relating to Maria's abortion and the secret contract between Oswald and her husband. How many viewers understood that the husband agreed, in exchange for substantial financial remuneration, not to return to and reclaim his wife until Oswald was dead?<br /><br />2) The ending is highly unsatisfying because arbitrary and accidental. The original screenplay called for Maria to commit suicide after the reading of Oswald's will, on finding out that her husband had in effect sold their marriage to Oswald. In the final version, however, Maria only runs water from a faucet across her wrist in a gesture of suicide. Maria is then summarily blown up, rather than having to confront and live with the consequences of her self-delusion and moral compromise.<br /><br />3) Fassbinder seeks to forcibly superimpose the public on the private, the political on the personal. Contrary to what the critics and \"experts\" assert, I don't think it works. Merely intruding historic radio news or the sound of the jackhammers of German reconstruction in the soundtrack on the dramatic events of the movie does not make those historical events integral to the drama. <br /><br />The selfish ambition of Maria's rise from poverty to prosperity is meant to parallel the so-called economic miracle of postwar Germany. Maria is thus intended to be a woman specific to and reflective of her time and place, but is in reality unoriginal and nonspecific. Women have been asserting their independence by using sex for self-advancement for ages. <br /><br />4) Lastly, there are several instances of inexcusable sloppiness and amateurishness -- Fassbinder's drug addiction and consequent impatience and inattention have had their effect. Unknown people talk off screen without ever being seen; music is clumsily intrusive in places; and melodramatic posturing sporadically substitutes for acting.<br /><br />Strangely, for a movie condemning a country for willful collective amnesia of the holocaust, it itself never mentions it

{"value":"This film offers absolutely no imagination in it's premise nor in it's execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so-called comedy that has no energy to speak of. Story is about nit-picky over analytical insurance risk manager Reuben Feffer (Ben Stiller) who finds his new wife Lisa (Debra Messing) cheating on him with a scuba instructor (Hank Azaria) after only one day on their honeymoon. Upon returning home Reuben and his best friend Sandy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) go to a party and run into Polly Prince (Jennifer Aniston) whom they went to school with years earlier.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT***** Polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who Reuben is as a person but they start to date and Reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods. But one day Lisa comes back and wants to remain married to Reuben but he really doesn't want to but Polly decides to leave as she doesn't believe in marriage to begin with.<br /><br />This film is the second directing effort by John Hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in \"Zoolander\" and \"Meet the Parents\" but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel. It's very easy to say something is not funny but I think with this film it's even easier to figure out why. This film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if it's only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script. Hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as \"There's Something About Mary\" but instead the events seem incredibly forced. Did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny? If you do, your easy! A few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious. Stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film doesn't work as a comedy or as a

{"value":"For me an unsatisfactory, unconvincing heist movie. With an A-List cast, particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like Spike Lee I was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie sub-genre. For a start I didn't like the pacing of the film, starting off with mastermind Clive Owen's raison d'etre piece to camera, unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion, then finding the narrative peppered with confusing, not to say unreal-seeming witness interviews, then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier. Of course the camera work is fluid throughout, constantly on the move and incorporating hand-camera shots a-plenty, but director Lee fails to deliver thrills or suspense, falling down fundamentally by not making anything of the key protagonists in the film. Denzel Washington is weighed down with the clothes and bad-ass jive talk of a \"Shaft\" movie thirty - five years earlier (he even has that \"no-one understands him but his woman\" thing going on, replete with his \"hot\" girlfriend, baiting her with some downright crude and inappropriate \"dirty-talk\") and his mild \"In The Heat Of The Night\" riff with Willem Defoe (in almost a bit-part) raises barely a ripple. Clive Owens plays his character with a resolutely English accent even as we're given to believe the gang is Arab-based, also hindered by having to play 90% of the film with a mask over his face. Jodie Foster delivers another of her patented tight-lipped, ice maiden, sub-Clarice Starling turns as a well connected financial bounty-hunter, if you will, to little effect. Overall it's a real mish-mash of a film, with a light but obvious twist at the end, in fact the title gives it away from the start, spoiler fans. Worst scene (of many) is undoubtedly Washington's witness-interview, unbelievably, with an 8 year old street-kid, although Owen's dialogue with the same child minutes earlier runs it close in the embarrassment stakes. During the film in-joke references are made by characters to classic heist films like \"Serpico\" and \"Dog Day Afternoon\" - but there's no honour in self-praise. More like \"The Hot Rock\" instead...and even that was good for a few

{"value":"***LIGHT SPOILER ALERT*** The story sounds good and if you've read the novel, then you're probably expecting a deep and intense movie that could offer some insight for some interesting and insufficiently explored human relationships.<br /><br />True enough, the script tries to do that, the director tries to do that, but the main cast fails miserably. Maria's acting is so dry that lacks any feeling whatsoever, her most intense moments seem almost comical. Sometimes she seems to be nervous due to the camera. Her only really feeling scene is near the end where she gets dumped by her girlfriend.<br /><br />Ioana seems even more tense than Maria and even worse, she doesn't seem natural at all. Maria had the attitude, even if it was artificially pushed towards being obvious, but she had it and her character received some credibility. And to make matters worse, we don't have an insight on her: where does she come from, how come she got involved in the lesbian relationship, how did the relationship evolve? We only get some bits from her parents and their relationship just seems to 'be' there: it has a content and and end, but no beginning. Just like her partner Maria, she has only once scene that is truly touching, the scene where she dumps Maria's character Kiki.<br /><br />Tudor is the only person in this movie (aside from the landlady, great acting there) who manages to prove some acting talent. He has his character's attitude and it fits him. Only once or twice he seems to falter (the scene at his parents' meal, he tries to be obvious when it wasn't necessary at all).<br /><br />I love the story, Tudor Chirila is OK there, the landlady actually acts and Puya delivers his couple of lines with style, but this doesn't save the movie. Too bad, the entire setting had huge potential and the Romanian cinematography could've used a movie on this theme.<br /><br />Oddly enough, the incestuous relationship between brother and sister seems to have more credibility than the no-background no-feeling (well, Maria's spoken interludes are a nice try in this direction) lesbian relationship of Maria and Ioana. I'm quite sorry for spending money on a ticket, I'd rather had watched it from the comfort of my room.","finished_norm":["light","spoiler","alert","the","stori","sound","good","and","if","you","have","read","the","novel","then","you","re","probabl","expect","a","deep","and","intens","movi","that","can","offer","some","insight","for","some","interest","and","insuffici","explor","human","relationshipsbr","br","true","enough","the","script","try","to","do","that","the","director","try","to","do","that","but","the","main","cast","fail","miser","mare","act","be","so","spindri","that","lack","ani","feel","whatsoev","her","much","intens","moment","seem","almost","comic","sometim","she","seem","to","be","nervou","due","to","the","camera","her","onli","realli","feel","scene","be","near","the","end","where","she","get","dump","by","her","girlfriendbr","br","ioana","seem","even","much","tens","than","mare","and","even","wrong","she","doe","not","seem","natur","at","all","mare","have","the","attitud","even","if","it","be","artifici","push","toward","be","obviou","but","she","have","it","and","her","charact","receiv","some","credibl","and","to","make","matter","wrong","we","do","not","have","a","insight","on","her","where","doe","she","come","from","how","come","she","get","involv","in","the","lesbian","relationship","how","do","the","relationship","evolv","we","onli","get","some","bit","from","her","parent","and","their","relationship","just","seem","to","be","there","it","have","a","content","and","and","end","but","no","begin","just","like","her","partner","mare","she","have","onli","onc","scene","that","be","truli","touch","the","scene","where","she","dump","mare","charact","kikibr","br","tudor","be","the","onli","person","in","thi","movi","asid","from","the","landladi","great","act","there","who","manag","to","prove","some","act","talent","he","have","hi","charact","attitud","and","it","fit","him","onli","onc","or","twice","he","seem","to","falter","the","scene","at","hi","parent","meal","he","try","to","be","obviou","when","it","be","not","necessari","at","allbr","br","i","love","the","stori","tudor","chirila","be","okai","there","the","landladi","actual","act","and","puya","deliv","hi","coupl","of","line","with","styl","but","thi","doe","not","save","the","movi","too","bad","the","entir","set","have","huge","potenti","and","the","romanian","cinematographi","can","have","us","a","movi","on","thi","themebr","br","oddli","enough","the","incestu","relationship","between","brother","and","sister","seem","to","have","much","credibl","than","the","nobackground","nofeel","good","mare","speak","interlud","be","a","nice","try","in","thi","direct","lesbian","relationship","of","mare","and","ioana","i","be","quit","sorri","for","spend","monei","on","a","ticket","i","have","rather","have","watch","it","from","the","comfort","of","my","room"],"filtered":["light","spoiler","alert","stori","sound","good","read","novel","re","probabl","expect","deep","intens","movi","offer","insight","interest","insuffici","explor","human","relationshipsbr","br","true","enough","script","try","director","try","main","cast","fail","miser","mare","act","spindri","lack","ani","feel","whatsoev","much","intens","moment","seem","almost","comic","sometim","seem","nervou","due","camera","onli","realli","feel","scene","near","end","get","dump","girlfriendbr","br","ioana","seem","even","much","tens","mare","even","wrong","doe","seem","natur","mare","attitud","even","artifici","push","toward","obviou","charact","receiv","credibl","make","matter","wrong","insight","doe","come","come","get","involv","lesbian","relationship","relationship","evolv","onli","get","bit","parent","relationship","seem","content","end","begin","like","partner","mare","onli","onc","scene","truli","touch","scene","dump","mare","charact","kikibr","br","tudor","onli","person","thi","movi","asid","landladi","great","act","manag","prove","act","talent","hi","charact","attitud","fit","onli","onc","twice","seem","falter","scene","hi","parent","meal","try","obviou","necessari","allbr","br","love","stori","tudor","chirila","okai","landladi","actual","act","puya","deliv","hi","coupl","line","styl","thi","doe","save","movi","bad","entir","set","huge","potenti","romanian","cinematographi","us","movi","thi","themebr","br","oddli","enough","incestu","relationship","brother","sister","seem","much","credibl","nobackground","nofeel","good","mare","speak","interlud","nice","try","thi","direct","lesbian","relationship","mare","ioana","quit","sorri","spend","monei","ticket","rather","watch","comfort","room"],"filtered2":["light","spoiler","alert","stori","sound","good","read","novel","re","probabl","expect","deep","intens","offer","insight","interest","insuffici","explor","human","relationshipsbr","true","enough","script","try","director","try","main","cast","fail","miser","mare","act","spindri","lack","ani","feel","whatsoev","intens","moment","seem","almost","comic","sometim","seem","nervou","due","camera","onli","realli","feel","scene","near","end","get","dump","girlfriendbr","ioana","seem","even"

{"value":"\"Why?\"<br /><br />That simple question had to be on the lips of every single New Yorker during the 12 months of terror that David Berkowitz created in 1976-77. That same one word will surely become the same perplexing question 22 summers later as people exit theaters exhibiting the trite and exploitative \"Summer of Sam\".<br /><br />Director Spike Lee attempts to weave the story of a pack of misguided thugs searching for the celebrated psychopath -- who paralyzed New York City for over a year -- with a stark and graphical depiction of the killings, the demons inside Berkowitz's head and the frustration of a futile NYPD manhunt. He presents an ensemble of despicable losers who hear their own \"barking dogs\" as they live lives devoid of love, honor and humanity -- no different than Berkowitz. Lee browbeats the audience in nearly every frame with \"not one of us are what we seem to be\". Often a critic of the white establishment, Lee perpetuates the stereotype by including a scene where Mira Sorvino, playing a newlywed with a cheating husband (John Leguizamo), hopes to have oral sex with a black man \"in the back of a big black Cadillac\". An Italian Mafioso tells a black detective that the famous Willie Mays' over-the-back center field catch was \"lucky\". Lee even makes sure to deliver the racist musings of one middle aged black woman who declares \"I'm happy it's a white man killing all these white people because if it were a black man killing all these white people - there would be the biggest race riot in NYC history.\"<br /><br />Other than an outstanding opening pan shot of an arrival at a disco (reminiscent of shots from Martin Scorcese's \"Goodfellas\" or Orson Welles' \"The Third Man\"), this film has no soul, purpose or passion. He parades characters on the screen bereft of human decency. Although we learn nothing about the true victims of this horrible spree, Spike Lee seems to be saying New York City got what it deserved during that frightening, boiling summer over two decades ago.<br /><br />\"How could anyone wreak such havoc on his beloved city?\" \"How could someone show such hatred toward his fellow man?\"<br /><br />Are these appropriate questions for Berkowitz or Lee?<br /><br />You

{"value":"I've given up trying to figure out what version of this I'm watching. The copyright at the end indicates 1983. And though this is not the important bit of my objection to this film, I will say that watching a film obviously made in the Aquarian Age (including long haired hippie chicks and odious station wagons) but with a 1980s synth soundtrack is unsettling. Extremely unsettling.<br /><br />My main objection here is HOW DARE THE FILMMAKERS BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE. HOW DARE THEY.<br /><br />Seriously she's all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies I've seen her in - this crapfest and the otherwise excellent Legend of Hell House - they kill her off.<br /><br />I would like to put the film industry on notice. Pamela Franklin has apparently retired from the business but if she ever decides to do another film and some blasted cur of a director attempts to kill her off I SHALL ASK HIM TO STEP OUTSIDE.<br /><br />NO ONE BEATS UP ON PAMELA FRANKLIN AND GETS AWAY WITH IT. I AM QUITE CROSS. THE FURY HAS BEEN UNLEASHED.<br /><br />For B-movie fans seeking out a crapfest, you could do much worse than this. On the plus side, this is not a film which involves Satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way - this movie is a hardcore satanic film.<br /><br />Wall-to-wall satanic ceremonies, baphomets, hallucinations, a ludicrous rat attack - what else could you ask for.<br /><br />This excellent stuff is quite nearly ruined by the baffling grafted-on 1980s synth soundtrack, which is about as mismatched to a film as it is possible to be. The soundtrack reminded me of something you'd hear on The Equalizer. It's really bad.<br /><br />Also, they made Pamela Franklin squash her charming English accent, which was also quite rude, if not a cruel atrocity (against the viewer) such as you might find covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

{"value":"I think \"The Best of Times\" was a lost cause from the get go. The initial premise (guy drops the winning touchdown pass against a rival high school team, can never seem to get over it and then tries to reunite the two teams to play again) is one of the dumbest I have ever heard. Since Ron Shelton went on to write much better sports films I wonder if there was more to it then that. I hope this film wasn't green lit with Shelton pitching the story as I wrote above.<br /><br />So we have the premise. Going from there you would think, or hope, that there might be a few twists along the way to keep things lively. No such luck. This script follows every predictable cliché you can think of. There isn't a moment in this film you won't see coming a mile away before the film reveals it and the ending.... well if you can't figure out the ending by the end of the first reel then you haven't paid attention or seen any other sports movie in your life.<br /><br />Robin Williams and Kurt Russell star (and bore) in the leads. Williams is the poor schmo who dropped the big pass and Russell is the quarterback who threw the fateful pass. Gee, do you think Russell will suit up just once more to see if he and Williams can right a wrong that the town has never forgotten? This is such a lame duck comedy with a lame duck script that one can only shake their heads wondering what might have been. Sure there are a few chuckles and, to be honest, there is one truly funny scene. Williams and Russell have marital problems and the wives invite them over for dinner to resolve things. Neither guy realizes that they have been invited over on a Monday and, yes, Monday Night Football is on. Keeping in mind that the two teams playing have a combined one victory, the men (Williams especially) try to resist the temptation to find out how the game is going. The scene dissolves into some hilarious bits as Williams goes to check the score by using a bathroom visit as a ruse. When he returns he coughs the score to Russell. Later as Russell is starting to make the moves on his wife Williams wheels the television into their view from another room.<br /><br />It's an inspired and funny scene in a mostly uninspired and

{"value":"I live in Ottawa where this film was made and I really wish it hadn't been. This is one God-awful flick. I really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is: Indie Films Blow. Well, this film does nothing to shed this curse. The actor, writer, director Brett Kelly does little to contribute to the genre, rather he re-hashes tired clichés from movies past. I am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting, it's way too overdone. <br /><br />I can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights. Now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension, but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie. As well for a movie that dares to call itself horror, a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore, other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring. <br /><br />The biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development, the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this Bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back. Not that this concept bugs me, but, I didn't really find it believable that when the two main characters, both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other. This is done in such a short time span that it's inconceivable, my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her. <br /><br />The last point that I have is.... and I won't hold this against Kelly, but the movie is shot entirely on boring, emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film. Although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat. My only hope is that something happens to prevent Brett Kelly from making a sequel, which has been reported on his website, a sequel that was half written in one sitting. <br /><br />Lord help us

My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie, \"Hollywood Shuffle\". True, he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable, but his movies are still fun.<br /><br />Meteor Man provides a hero with an Urban Contemporary feel. I always felt that, if there were superheroes, they wouldn't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics. Meteor Man is realistic hero with real problems: Car broken into, bad neighborhood, local drug-dealing gangs using children for distribution, etc. The scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community.<br /><br />What I found to be truly entertaining, outside of James Earl Jones' \"young forever\" performance, was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers. It wasn't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him, without his input, of course. It was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived.<br /><br />Yes, the plot was weak, the movie was predictable, there was bad acting and continuity was rotten, but it ranks #1 with my kids. Robert Townsend works to bring movies \"home\" so to speak. I doubt he'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor/producer/director he truly is, but there are and will always be, those that love him for his efforts.<br /><br />One point to ponder about the film, which I find amusing: Throughout the entire battle with Simon, no one bothered to call the police???? Also, what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window? My mother would have been right there, scrapping by my side, toe-to-toe. Dad would be loading his pistol. lol<br /><br />Rent it and check it out. It's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of Sinbad, Luther Vandross, Bill Cosby, Big Daddy Kane, etc. Great job with the cameos

Bondarchuk of course had already been an established acting star for a decade but thespian skills mean little behind the camera, and as a director he was woefully unprepared to undertake a production of such scale. And it shows through muddled shot compositions especially apparent in group scenes, often unfortunate camera positions, performances of wildly varying quality for the director was apparently so overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the task actors were apparently left to their own devices, awkward voiceovers that sound like radio broadcast announcements.<br /><br />Vidor's \"War and Peace\" was probably the main reason that prompted the Soviet government to spare no expense on this production. The USSR release of the Vidor's picture made quite a splash. Certainly, Bondarchuk wanted to emulate the greatest strength of the Hollywood film and find his own Audrey. His final choice, Lyudmila Savelyeva, a big-eyed sprightly dark-haired thing indeed somewhat resembles Hepburn. Unfortunately she was a Kirov ballet dancer without neither acting experience nor talent, so unsurprisingly the most kind word that I can find to describe her performance is \"awful\".<br /><br />Though it might be expected that Soviet actors, speaking the same language as Tolstoy's characters, would have better understanding of them than foreigners but this War and Peace often proves that not to be the case. The revolutionary upheaval swept away the thin upper layer of Russian cultural soil, that the world of War and Peace grown out of, so a good share of these big name Soviet actors involved in this production often look as clueless as Americans performing Shakespeare ( I don't mean of course that American actors can't possibly play Shakespeare credibly, but you'll know what I mean if you witnessed American members of the cast in Branagh's adaptations). Of the three main characters only Bondarchuk's Pierre is commendable, but even he was too old for the part and feels out of place in the early

Though my age probably plays a major role in how I judge this show, after reading other's reviews, I have come to see that after the third season, this show went down the tubes. I agree. This show is obnoxious, repetitive and usually focuses on the same plot.<br /><br />The show revolves around Timmy Turner, who was granted two Fairy Godparents because basically his life was horrible - his parents were never around, and he had a nasty baby-sitter. The plot of the entire show is that this kid (Timmy) and his Godparents always wish up some destruction that cannot be prevented by making another wish, because something in \"Da Rules\" says they can't. The show has a lot of lines that keep being repeated, like \"magic cannot break true love, super toilet\" or even just some scummy jokes lines that Nickelodeon probably thought was funny and decided to put in the episode various times.<br /><br />The show is aimed at kids younger than 10, because it involves gross situations and \"kid humor\" that most kids of my age wouldn't care for. The character voice selection could've been better too. Timmy has an extremely loud, shrill, feminine voice as does Cosmo. Wanda sounds like an old lady. Timmy's dad sounds like some announcer or game show host, Timmy's mom's voice is too exaggerated to sound feminine. Attitudes in this show are: in some episodes, Timmy talks back and acts spoiled and snobbish. Wanda apparently is smart and wise. Cosmo is stupid, dumb and incapable of thinking as is Timmy's dad. Timmy's mom seems to end up doing whatever Timmy's dad does.<br /><br />The show is too far flung from reality to get my likings anymore. Maybe as a younger kid, I could see more of the humor in this show, but as I grow up, it really grows old. And not to sound conceded or \"trashing\" but the show does have that mentality that makes you want to commit homicidal activity towards the characters. A show like this just has to be your attitude, if you know what I mean. If not, it basically disgusts

{"value":"Based on the average short story by horror writer Stephen King about so called 'Sleepwalkers' ancient and immortal cat-like creatures that suck the life out of virgins in order that this energy may sustain them They have supernatural abilities- they can make themselves 'dim' which means they become invisible and can create subliminal mirages to fool people.They have been fleeing humans for century's we are told and have one by one been picked off till there are only two left.The film starts when a beautiful mother and her son arrive in a sleepy town, they are the last of the sleepwalkers and they are on the prowl for virgins to feed on. The mother sends her son out to enrol at the local high school so he can find a virgin, he does (Madchen Amick) and proceeds to try to get her alone so he can suck her dry. It is not made clear why the mother cannot seek out virgins herself- it would make things easier one would imagine as teenage boys are much more apt to follow a older beautiful woman to a secluded area than a teen girl follow a teen boy. However his plans are thwarted as the girl fights back, jabbing a pencil in to his ear. The police are called and the hunt is on!. The son is sick from his injuries and so the mother goes on the rampage killing cops left and right in her hunt for the girl who hurt her son and spouting some painfully unfunny one liners amidst the gore. Finally the girl kills the mother- end of movie. This movie is rubbish!. The acting is variable, from the average Brian Krause to the excellent Alice Krige. The special effects are average,and showcase some early computer effects which is mildly interesting as it shows how far such things have progressed in such a short time. The direction is muddled and the film falls in to camp in places. The director seems unsure whether we are supposed to fear the sleepwalkers or sympathise with them and when in doubt allows the film to become hysterical. Stephen King makes a mildly amusing cameo as an annoying gardener as does Mark Hamill, as a puzzled cop. Alice Krige seems to shoulder the film, her character is given depth and she gives an indication of what the film could have been with a better screenplay and better direction.","finished_norm":["base","on","the","averag","short","stori","by","horror","writer","stephen","king","about","so","call","sleepwalk","ancient","and","immort","catlik","creatur","that","suck","the","life","out","of","virgin","in","order","that","thi","energi","mai","sustain","them","thei","have","supernatur","abil","thei","can","make","themselv","dim","which","mean","thei","becom","invis","and","can","creat","sublimin","mirag","to","fool","peoplethei","have","be","flee","human","for","centuri","we","be","tell","and","have","on","by","on","be","pick","off","till","there","be","onli","two","leftth","film","start","when","a","beauti","mother","and","her","son","arriv","in","a","sleepi","town","thei","be","the","last","of","the","sleepwalk","and","thei","be","on","the","prowl","for","virgin","to","fee","on","the","mother","send","her","son","out","to","enrol","at","the","local","high","school","so","he","can","find","a","virgin","he","doe","madchen","amick","and","proce","to","try","to","get","her","alon","so","he","can","suck","her","spindri","it","be","not","make","clear","why","the","mother","cannot","seek","out","virgin","herself","it","would","make","thing","easi","on","would","imagin","a","teenag","boi","be","much","much","apt","to","follow","a","old","beauti","woman","to","a","seclud","area","than","a","teen","girl","follow","a","teen","boi","howev","hi","plan","be","thwart","a","the","girl","fight","back","jab","a","pencil","in","to","hi","ear","the","polic","be","call","and","the","hunt","be","on","the","son","be","sick","from","hi","injuri","and","so","the","mother","go","on","the","rampag","kill","cop","leav","and","right","in","her","hunt","for","the","girl","who","hurt","her","son","and","spout","some","painfulli","unfunni","on","liner","amidst","the","gore","final","the","girl","kill","the","mother","end","of","movi","thi","movi","be","rubbish","the","act","be","variabl","from","the","averag","brian","kraus","to","the","excel","alic","krige","the","special","effect","be","averageand","showcas","some","earli","comput","effect","which","be","mildli","interest","a","it","show","how","far","such","thing","have","progress","in","such","a","short","time","the","direct","be","muddl","and","the","film","fall","in","to","camp","in","place","the","director","seem","unsur","whether","we","be","suppos","to","fear","the","sleepwalk","or","sympathis","with","them","and","when","in","doubt","allow","the","film","to","becom","hyster","stephen","king","make","a","mildli","amus","cameo","a","a","annoi","garden","a","doe","mark","hamil","a","a","puzzl","cop","alic","krige","seem","to","shoulder","the","film","her","charact","be","give","depth","and","she","give","a","indic","of","what","the","film","can","have","be","with","a","well","screenplai","and","well","direct"],"filtered":["base","averag","short","stori","horror","writer","stephen","king","call","sleepwalk","ancient","immort","catlik","creatur","suck","life","virgin","order","thi","energi","mai","sustain","thei","supernatur","abil","thei","make","themselv","dim","mean","thei","becom","invis","creat","sublimin","mirag","fool","peoplethei","flee","human","centuri","tell","pick","till","onli","two","leftth","film","start","beauti","mother","son","arriv","sleepi","town","thei","last","sleepwalk","thei","prowl","virgin","fee","mother","send","son","enrol","local","high","school","find","virgin","doe","madchen","amick","proce","try","get","alon","suck","spindri","make","clear","mother","seek","virgin","make","thing","easi","imagin","teenag","boi","much","much","apt","follow","old","beauti","woman","seclud","area","teen","girl","follow","teen","boi","howev","hi","plan","thwart","girl","fight","back","jab","pencil","hi","ear","polic","call","hunt","son","sick","hi","injuri","mother","go","rampag","kill","cop","leav","right","hunt","girl","hurt","son","spout","painfulli","unfunni","liner","amidst","gore","final","girl","kill","mother","end","movi","thi","movi","rubbish","act","variabl","averag","brian","kraus","excel","alic","krige","special","effect","averageand","showcas","earli","comput","effect","mildli","interest","show","far","thing","progress","short","time","direct","muddl","film","fall","camp","place","director","seem","unsur","whether","suppos","fear","sleepwalk","sympathis","doubt","allow","film","becom","hyster","stephen","king","make","mildli","amus","cameo","annoi","garden","doe","mark","hamil","puzzl","cop","alic","krige","seem","shoulder","film","charact","give","depth","give","indic","film","well","screenplai","well","direct"],"filtered2":["base","averag","short","stori","horror","writer","stephen","king","call","sleepwalk","ancient","immort","catlik","creatur","suck","life","virgin","order","energi","mai","sustain","supernatur","abil","make","themselv","dim","mean","becom","invis","creat","sublimin","mirag","fool","peoplethei","flee","human","centuri","tell","pick","till","onli","two","leftth","start","beauti","mother","son","arriv","sleep

{"value":"Yet ANOTHER movie about a group of less-than-intelligent individuals on a road trip who wander off their original travel route for either a short-cut or, in this case, to visit a run-down side show attraction. The results, as expected, are not at all good, as this particular side show is home to a bunch of lunatic, in-bred residents who were escaped prison inmates from years before. The father, who is apparently a professionally photographer, just HAS to stop and take pictures of the place, only to find that it still inhabited. The various members of the family wander off to view the various attractions, only to be scared away. Thinking they made it safely on their way, the van tire explodes (surprise!), leaving them to seek refuge and accommodations in the small town, which we find out is inhabited solely by the freaks (surprise!).<br /><br />This film plays out as expected, with the family being stalked and killed by the freaks. There is some fighting back on the families part, but these are probably among the worst scenes in the film, as they are badly executed. There is nothing remotely original here, unless you count the totally inappropriate soundtrack that is played during particular scenes that completely ruins the atmosphere and mood of the film. The acting is about as bad as I have seen in quite some time by everyone involved (it is pretty bad when your cast is out-acted by the cast of \"Camp Blood). The special effects are lousy and the ending made me want to punch my television.<br /><br />Still, though, despite all the negatives, I somewhat enjoyed this film. It definitely has a \"so bad it's good\" vibe to it. I made it through the entire movie and was even pleasantly entertained once I got past the ridiculously clichéd plot, terrible acting, and cheesy special effects. Though the ending left me feeling cheated and angry, particularly because the film is not that great to begin with and the ending makes the entire film pointless.<br /><br />Bottom line, I can list countless films that if you have seen them, you have seen this. The difference is most of those film are better. Though not a complete waste, this film is pretty bad and not remotely scary.<br /><br />My Grade:

{"value":"That's right! Under 9 on average, but maybe under 12s for some others! I was 11 when I originally saw this on video and at such youth I wasn't able to notice the shoddy cartoon-quality or the fact that those classic characters we have all grown to love are Not the same or as good to see. Just about everything is so 2D here! Belle is, I'll agree, not even beautiful but just a plain-looking woman with tinted skin, she wears the same bright blue dress all the way through with not one glamorous dress on, Wardrobe is to say the Least, annoying - my ears may bleed if I had to listen to her everyday! Lumiere, in both the original and the Christmas edition was suave and elegant, but here he is a womanizing, unfunny twit! Cogsworth, despite being the no-nonsense housekeeper he is famous for, is a complete sh-t and the most insufferable character I'd say! He always seems to find shutting that unbearably grating pie-hole of his very difficult in this one and whose clock face should really have been used for turning back in time to the unforgettable two film in this series! Poor, poor Mrs Potts was not brought to life by Angela Lansbury (one of my favourite classic actresses) but by Anne Rogers who captured none of Mrs Potts' character, no offence to her! Not if she did her best! When the beast roars it sounds so horrifically fake with clearly no additional roars, snarls or growls by a microphone. I am aware that this is only a third feature following two other films so of course it wouldn't be as good but I'm sure that more of a contribution wouldn't have hurt the Disney artists who, indeed, have achieved such remarkable styles of animation over the years. It's alright, I guess, and I do watch it sometimes though only when it suits me. It's quite difficult to make a recommendation for you reading this because it depends on how old you are but remember this will not at all be what you may expect following the earlier spectacular movies! And to think that on my video of it the text on the back cover said \"boasting brilliant animation\"! It's a nice little flick but for one thing it's also highly poor and, for another, those 3 words ought to have been saved for the next re-release of the original!","finished_norm":["that","right","under","on","averag","but","mayb","under","for","some","other","i","be","when","i","origin","see","thi","on","video","and","at","such","youth","i","be","not","abl","to","notic","the","shoddi","cartoonqu","or","the","fact","that","that","classic","charact","we","have","all","grow","to","love","be","not","the","same","or","a","good","to","see","just","about","everyth","be","so","have","here","bell","be","i","will","agre","not","even","beauti","but","just","a","plainlook","woman","with","tint","skin","she","wear","the","same","bright","blue","dress","all","the","wai","through","with","not","on","glamor","dress","on","wardrob","be","to","sai","the","littl","annoi","my","ear","mai","ble","if","i","have","to","listen","to","her","everydai","lumier","in","both","the","origin","and","the","christma","edit","be","suav","and","eleg","but","here","he","be","a","woman","unfunni","twit","cogsworth","despit","be","the","nononsens","housekeep","he","be","famou","for","be","a","complet","sht","and","the","much","insuffer","charact","i","have","sai","he","alwai","seem","to","find","shut","that","unbear","grate","piehol","of","hi","veri","difficult","in","thi","on","and","whose","clock","face","should","realli","have","be","us","for","turn","back","in","time","to","the","unforgett","two","film","in","thi","seri","poor","poor","mr","pott","be","not","bring","to","life","by","angela","lansburi","on","of","my","favourit","classic","actress","but","by","ann","roger","who","captur","none","of","mr","pott","charact","no","offenc","to","her","not","if","she","do","her","well","when","the","beast","roar","it","sound","so","horrif","fake","with","clearli","no","addit","roar","snarl","or","growl","by","a","microphon","i","be","awar","that","thi","be","onli","a","featur","follow","two","other","film","so","of","cours","it","would","not","be","a","good","but","i","be","sure","that","much","of","a","contribut","would","not","have","hurt","the","disnei","artist","who","ind","have","achiev","such","remark","styl","of","anim","over","the","year","it","alright","i","guess","and","i","do","watch","it","sometim","though","onli","when","it","suit","me","it","quit","difficult","to","make","a","recommend","for","you","read","thi","becaus","it","depend","on","how","old","you","be","but","rememb","thi","will","not","at","all","be","what","you","mai","expect","follow","the","earli","spectacular","movi","and","to","think","that","on","my","video","of","it","the","text","on","the","back","cover","sai","boast","brilliant","anim","it","a","nice","littl","flick","but","for","on","thing","it","conjur","highli","poor","and","for","anoth","that","word","ought","to","have","be","save","for","the","next","rereleas","of","the","origin"],"filtered":["right","averag","mayb","origin","see","thi","video","youth","abl","notic","shoddi","cartoonqu","fact","classic","charact","grow","love","good","see","everyth","bell","agre","even","beauti","plainlook","woman","tint","skin","wear","bright","blue","dress","wai","glamor","dress","wardrob","sai","littl","annoi","ear","mai","ble","listen","everydai","lumier","origin","christma","edit","suav","eleg","woman","unfunni","twit","cogsworth","despit","nononsens","housekeep","famou","complet","sht","much","insuffer","charact","sai","alwai","seem","find","shut","unbear","grate","piehol","hi","veri","difficult","thi","whose","clock","face","realli","us","turn","back","time","unforgett","two","film","thi","seri","poor","poor","mr","pott","bring","life","angela","lansburi","favourit","classic","actress","ann","roger","captur","none","mr","pott","charact","offenc","well","beast","roar","sound","horrif","fake","clearli","addit","roar","snarl","growl","microphon","awar","thi","onli","featur","follow","two","film","cours","good","sure","much","contribut","hurt","disnei","artist","ind","achiev","remark","styl","anim","year","alright","guess","watch","sometim","though","onli","suit","quit","difficult","make","recommend","read","thi","becaus","depend","old","rememb","thi","mai","expect","follow","earli","spectacular","movi","think","video","text","back","cover","sai","boast","brilliant","anim","nice","littl","flick","thing","conjur","highli","poor","anoth","word","save","next","rereleas","origin"],"filtered2":["right","averag","mayb","origin","see","video","youth","abl","notic","shoddi","cartoonqu","fact","classic","charact","grow","love","good","see","everyth","bell","agre","even","beauti","plainlook","woman","tint","skin","wear","bright","blue","dress","wai","glamor","dress","wardrob","littl","annoi","ear","mai","ble","listen","everydai","lumier","origin","christma","edit","suav","eleg","woman","unfunni","twit","cogsworth","despit","nononsens","housekeep","famou","complet","sht","insuffer","charact","alwai","seem","find","shut","unbear","grate","piehol","veri","difficult","whose","clock","face","realli","us","turn","back","time","unforgett","two","poor","poor","mr","pott","bring","life","angel
