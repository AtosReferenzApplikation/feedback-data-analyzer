{"value":"I've now seen this film twice, and I must say I enjoyed it both times. It's fast paced and fun, but ultimately daft. Having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original. It is clear for those who have seen the awful 'Zombie Creeping Flesh' that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to Bruno Mattei, and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to Fulci. This is not idle Fulci sycophancy, the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout, and you can tell who directed what, particularly in Mattei's case.<br /><br />The film is centered around the outbreak of a virus (oddly referred to as 'top secret' by a scientist, it's secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind) somewhere in south east Asia. The virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected, and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of land. Our protagonists unwittingly wander into the danger zone, and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected Asians.<br /><br />The film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick, and an out and out action adventure, and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves. They do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all. Some are of the regular soulless shuffling variety, so well rendered in the original, and probably Fulci's creation here. The other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves, but incurred a savage aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu: Indecisively leaping around unsure of whether to continue honing their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brethren in what looks like a mass tickle fest on their hapless victims. Martial arts skills aren't their only talents either, they are well versed in guerilla tactics, hiding on rafters and under bales of hay, and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves. This is all definitely the work of Mattei.<br /><br />There is a third, more chatty, variety of zombie. This type apparently retain a sense of irony as well 'I'm really thirsty...FOR YOUR BLOOD'. The ridiculous twist at the end in which the DJ turns zombie but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of mankind, only serves to enhance the WTF factor and obliterate any hope of a serious resolution.<br /><br />Then there's the infamous zombie head which slowly propels itself through the air, a jokerish skeletal grin wrought across its face, as if to say 'yeah we know how bad this looks'.<br /><br />The characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect. But its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously. Having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace. Indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie agro, and one of the only effective scenes in the film.<br /><br />The guy who played the chief scientist has heart, but no talent, utilising pauses in his lines entirely at random, so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic. The scientists' on screen attempts at finding an antidote are totally unconvincing 'now lets put these two molecules together!' <br /><br />There are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however. In an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage. Upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor, all shot in an atmospheric diffused light. The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a speedy machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his wake in his alarming desperation to have her. His sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film. The before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak, and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance. There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead, and this is quite tense. Things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs. But this is sloppily handled and not nearly as effective as it could have been.<br /><br />All in all I would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest, rather than simply a through and through bad film. If nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that I've come to expect from just about anything Italian and gory from the eighties.","finished_norm":["i","have","now","see","thi","film","twice","and","i","must","sai","i","enjoi","it","both","time","it","fast","pace","and","fun","but","ultim","daft","have","sai","that","it","deserv","to","be","trash","becaus","of","screw","up","what","can","have","be","a","good","follow","up","to","the","semin","origin","it","be","clear","for","that","who","have","see","the","aw","zombi","creep","flesh","that","the","film","massiv","shortcom","can","be","ow","to","bruno","mattei","and","that","the","littl","that","be","commend","about","it","can","be","ow","to","fulci","thi","be","not","idl","fulci","sycoph","the","director","styl","be","starkli","contrast","throughout","and","you","can","tell","who","direct","what","particularli","in","mattei","casebr","br","the","film","be","center","around","the","outbreak","of","a","viru","oddli","refer","to","a","top","secret","by","a","scientist","it","secreci","appar","be","much","noteworthi","than","it","potenti","apocalypt","effect","on","mankind","somewher","in","south","east","asia","the","viru","caus","zombi","like","behaviour","in","that","affect","and","the","viru","quickli","spread","across","a","seemingli","arbitrari","area","of","land","our","protagonist","unwittingli","wander","into","the","danger","zone","and","have","to","fight","for","their","live","against","hord","of","infect","asiansbr","br","the","film","seem","to","be","stick","half","wai","between","be","a","zombi","gore","flick","and","a","out","and","out","action","adventur","and","thi","confus","be","captur","much","clearli","by","the","zombi","themselv","thei","do","not","appear","to","have","a","set","of","characterist","common","to","all","some","be","of","the","regular","soulless","shuffl","varieti","so","good","render","in","the","origin","and","probabl","fulci","creation","here","the","other","main","group","consist","of","that","who","in","be","infect","with","the","viru","lose","all","sens","of","themselv","but","incur","a","savag","aggress","and","a","desir","to","earn","a","black","belt","in","ninjitsu","indecis","leap","around","unsur","of","whether","to","continu","hone","their","upper","roundhous","techniqu","or","engag","with","their","brother","in","what","look","like","a","mass","tickl","fest","on","their","hapless","victim","martial","art","skill","be","not","their","onli","talent","either","thei","be","good","vers","in","guerilla","tactic","hide","on","rafter","and","under","bale","of","hai","and","sometim","inexplic","fall","from","nowher","but","the","heaven","themselv","thi","be","all","definit","the","work","of","matteibr","br","there","be","a","much","chatti","varieti","of","zombi","thi","typ","appar","retain","a","sens","of","ironi","a","good","i","be","realli","thirstyfor","your","blood","the","ridicul","twist","at","the","end","in","which","the","dj","turn","zombi","but","continu","to","preach","ad","lib","gibberish","about","the","fate","of","mankind","onli","serv","to","enhanc","the","wtf","factor","and","obliter","ani","hope","of","a","seriou","resolutionbr","br","then","there","the","infam","zombi","head","which","slowli","propel","itself","through","the","air","a","jokerish","skelet","grin","work","across","it","face","a","if","to","sai","ye","we","know","how","bad","thi","looksbr","br","the","charact","be","all","utterli","on","dimension","a","you","would","expect","but","it","the","pseudo","comic","dialogu","and","dub","that","realli","prevent","u","from","take","their","plight","serious","have","sai","that","the","soldier","to","die","doe","put","up","a","impress","valiant","displai","against","a","unstopp","zombi","menac","ind","thi","be","the","and","perhap","onli","time","we","hit","real","zombi","agro","and","on","of","the","onli","effect","scene","in","the","filmbr","br","the","gui","who","plai","the","chief","scientist","have","heart","but","no","talent","utilis","paus","in","hi","line","entir","at","random","so","he","end","up","sound","like","a","confus","asthmat","the","scientist","on","screen","attempt","at","find","a","antidot","be","total","unconvinc","now","let","put","thi","two","molecul","togeth","br","br","there","be","a","few","moment","that","stick","out","a","genuin","effect","howev","in","a","earli","scene","a","femal","protagonist","explor","a","abandon","garag","upon","enter","a","room","we","be","confront","with","a","hazi","view","of","a","shift","figur","in","the","corner","and","a","squirm","mass","on","the","floor","all","shoot","in","a","atmospher","diffus","light","the","silenc","be","interrupt","by","the","appear","of","a","speedi","machet","wield","zombi","who","trash","everyth","in","hi","wake","in","hi","alarm","desper","to","have","her","hi","sheer","aggress","be","on","of","the","few","moment","of","real","horror","in","the","film","the","befor","and","after","theme","convei","through","the","hotel","that","plai","host","to","the","happen","of","the","earli","stage","of","the","outbreak","and","late","a","a","refu

{"value":"I guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first Superman film,as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original.<br /><br />After an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals, the credits pay homage to the even-crummy-looking-for-their-time futuristic sweeping credits of the original Superman film.<br /><br />Then there is some more murky stuff. Ma Kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm, and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield. Then Superman sneaks up on her and faints.<br /><br />Next we catch up with Lex Luthor in a scene about many murky close-ups of an old lady as she dies. We don't see Luthor's face until the end of the scene, an early instance of the film's drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned. Lex Luthor is a guy who doesn't like Superman because he is not human. Also, he probably doesn't like humans either, as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about Lex Luthor planning to kill most of Earth's population.<br /><br />After a while, Clark Kent shows up back at his old job (I forgot to mention, he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened). Then he finds out Lois Lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating Cyclops. It upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame.<br /><br />At this point we see that Miss Lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle. It is some kind of important event on account of it is on television. Then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event. There are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit. The film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer.<br /><br />As the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build, I excused myself to get a soda. I accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about Al Gore showing slides in its entirety. I tried to find my way back to Superman Returns, but I somehow wandered into Prairie Home Companion, which I watched twice in a row. Then it was time to stop messing around.<br /><br />I walked back into the first theater, found my seat, and looked up to see that the impending Lois Lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us. Still, it seemed to be taking forever, so I wandered around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son and sent him off to college. While attending my son's medical school graduation, I remembered that I should probably check in on Superman Returns, so I excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry. It still took about another half hour before things went wrong for Space Shuttle Lane. When they did, Superman saved everybody, which was pretty cool.<br /><br />. And then there is a a subplot where Superman turns really creepy and starts stalking Lois Lane and her family with his x-ray vision and super-hearing. Then he tries to get her to cheat on Cyclops, who seems like a good guy.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lex Luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie. I forgot to bring my scorecard home with me (they give you one at the door), but I think he scored damn close to one hundred percent. I hope he wins the million dollars.<br /><br />At this point, things start to gear up for the big murky finale. I think maybe the projector was broken, on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here. I remember seeing murky things growing out of the water, Superman getting sick, Superman getting better, back to the murky things, he's sick again, no wait, he's okay again.<br /><br />Then Lex Luthor unleashed his final bad guy move: yelling at his girlfriend a little bit.<br /><br />Then Superman died and came back to life. I thought the movie was over, so I left.<br /><br />Ninety years later, the nursing home where I lived felt a little chilly. I realized I left my sweatshirt back in the theater, and I went to retrieve it. When I did, I was slightly surprised to find that Superman Returns wasn't over yet. I tried to ask some of the viewers what I missed, but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by now.<br /><br />I sat back in my old seat and watched as Lois Lane puttered around her house for a while. Then Superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie, and since I already saw that part I thought it was okay to leave.<br /><br />So that is my review of Superman Returns.<br /><br />Oh, also, if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog, you will love this movie. On account of there are two jokes like that in

{"value":"This is one of those movies in which people keep saying \"That's a great idea!\" about the worst ideas you've ever heard. Then they act on them. I like it. This picture's funnier than any 3 dozen Seth Rogen projects. Well, so is SHOAH. <br /><br />Gojira movies have been cannibalizing their own origin-stories since the 60s, but this one goes further. What can you say about a culture willing to rape its own sacred cultural icons for a quick buck? This travesty presents a WW2 suicide brigade on \"the last of the Marshall Islands\" presenting arms to a dinosaur who chased the US Marines away. Then the Japanese inexplicably decide not to fight to the last man, and instead abandon the territory annexed on their behalf by this giant lizard. They retreat to the mainland, where one of them becomes a business tycoon.<br /><br />Then it gets complicated.<br /><br />Blonde men from the future, irritable over not yet curing male pattern baldness, come back in time in a sort of flying saucer to ask a failed writer and a celebrity psychic for their help in eliminating Godzilla before he destroys Japan. The \"help\" is questionable, as all these 1992 citizens do is go back to 1944 to watch some closed-circuit TV, but, hey, they shot the script. You would think that by the 90s the Japanese would know better than to trust people in spaceships. Fortunately for Nippon, the white guys - you can tell they're American because they say \"nucyaler\" - erred by bringing back in time the one Japanese girl left in the future. In a touching display of ancestor worship, she outs their duplicity after donning a flying suit made from ductwork taped to a Sailor Moon backpack. Turns out these time-traveling, fashion-disabled Caucasians are just jealous of Japan's impending economic imperialist takeover of the known world (in the 22d century Japan's going to buy Africa, which sounds more like a liability than an asset). These blondes in padded chintz suits with nonfunctioning straps and redundant zippers want to replace Godzilla with King Ghidorah, who will destroy all of Japan except Tokyo. A strange choice, but Toho's been known to go out of its way not to have to build that Tokyo skyline set again.<br /><br />Sure enough, we are given the alternate spectacle of Fukuoka (\"my garden city\") and some other heretofore unscathed-by-rubber-monster metropolitan areas being laid waste by a flying gold metalflake 1/3 of a hydra. In a surprise revelation, we are informed that King Ghidorah was created from some hand puppets left too long in the microwave. Godzilla also does his share of demolition as the movie winds down. Wait - didn't the spaceship blondes already destroy Godzilla? Yeah, they killed him in the third reel. But nobody expected that the Japanese of 1992 had a secret submarine filled with nuclear missiles - \"Ha ha, don't worry. We don't keep it in Japanese waters\" - with which to jumpstart a new Godzilla from the bones of an old dinosaur. Only they don't have to, because a leaky old nuclear shipwreck has already made Godzilla whole again. Oh, and Godzilla finally gets to Tokyo, reuniting with his old army buddy in a heartwarming moment of tearful recognition. They look into each other's eyes, and Godzilla nods as if to say, \"Gotta do it, man.\" The tycoon nods in understanding. Then Godzilla blows him up.<br /><br />I should also mention here that, in order to prevent Godzilla's revamped angry self from fulfilling his destiny and destroying Japan, the Japanese girl from the future goes BACK to the future to ask for help from - yes - a balding white man. Probably because he pities her as the sole Asian character from the 23d century, he agrees to build a Mecha-Ghidora and send it back to the 1990s, so that together, these two giant monsters can, uh, fulfill Godzilla's destiny and destroy Japan. In a wonderful nod to those notoriously self-willed whipping heads, the girl piloting Mecha-Ghidora has trouble controlling the joystick.<br /><br />This Godzilla suit design owes much to the Sumo - his thighs are flabby enough to double for Rush Limbaugh's, and his belly and chest are thick and ponderous. But there's more exploding masonry in this picture than in most of his adventures, which makes up for a lot. Also features a man with a passing resemblance to Robert Patrick playing a killer robot. Yes, in the future even the robots will have bald spots. Plus Megumi Odaka, reprising her role as Micki, the only Japanese girl ever born with ears larger than her Disney namesake and an acting style even bigger than that. It's not her fault: many Japanese directors seem to feel that a seventy-foot screen isn't quite large enough to display the emotion of a human face. I did some acting for Japanese television, and I can tell you, they push you to go for it. They apparently urge their writers in the same way.

God.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","that","movi","in","which","peopl","keep","sai","that","a","great","idea","about","the","wrong","idea","you","have","ever","hear","then","thei","act","on","them","i","like","it","thi","pictur","funni","than","ani","dozen","seth","rogen","project","good","so","be","shoah","br","br","gojira","movi","have","be","cannib","their","own","originstori","sinc","the","but","thi","on","go","far","what","can","you","sai","about","a","cultur","will","to","rape","it","own","sacr","cultur","icon","for","a","quick","buck","thi","travesti","present","a","ww","suicid","brigad","on","the","last","of","the","marshal","island","present","arm","to","a","dinosaur","who","chase","the","u","marin","awai","then","the","japanes","inexplic","decid","not","to","fight","to","the","last","man","and","instead","abandon","the","territori","annex","on","their","behalf","by","thi","giant","lizard","thei","retreat","to","the","mainland","where","on","of","them","becom","a","busi","tycoonbr","br","then","it","get","complicatedbr","br","blond","man","from","the","futur","irrit","over","not","yet","cure","male","pattern","bald","come","back","in","time","in","a","sort","of","fly","saucer","to","ask","a","fail","writer","and","a","celebr","psychic","for","their","help","in","elimin","godzilla","befor","he","destroi","japan","the","help","be","question","a","all","thi","citizen","do","be","go","back","to","to","watch","some","closedcircuit","tv","but","hei","thei","shoot","the","script","you","would","think","that","by","the","the","japanes","would","know","well","than","to","trust","peopl","in","spaceship","fortun","for","nippon","the","white","gui","you","can","tell","thei","re","american","becaus","thei","sai","nucyal","err","by","bring","back","in","time","the","on","japanes","girl","leav","in","the","futur","in","a","touch","displai","of","ancestor","worship","she","out","their","duplic","after","don","a","fly","suit","make","from","ductwork","tape","to","a","sailor","moon","backpack","turn","out","thi","timetravel","fashiondis","caucasian","be","just","jealou","of","japan","impend","econom","imperialist","takeov","of","the","know","world","in","the","have","centuri","japan","go","to","bui","africa","which","sound","much","like","a","liabil","than","a","asset","thi","blond","in","pad","chintz","suit","with","nonfunct","strap","and","redund","zipper","want","to","replac","godzilla","with","king","ghidorah","who","will","destroi","all","of","japan","except","tokyo","a","strang","choic","but","toho","be","know","to","go","out","of","it","wai","not","to","have","to","build","that","tokyo","skylin","set","againbr","br","sure","enough","we","be","give","the","altern","spectacl","of","fukuoka","my","garden","citi","and","some","other","heretofor","unscathedbyrubbermonst","metropolitan","area","be","lai","wast","by","a","fly","gold","metalflak","of","a","hydra","in","a","surpris","revel","we","be","inform","that","king","ghidorah","be","creat","from","some","hand","puppet","leav","too","long","in","the","microwav","godzilla","conjur","doe","hi","share","of","demolit","a","the","movi","wind","down","wait","do","not","the","spaceship","blond","alreadi","destroi","godzilla","ye","thei","kill","him","in","the","reel","but","nobodi","expect","that","the","japanes","of","have","a","secret","submarin","fill","with","nuclear","missil","ha","ha","do","not","worri","we","do","not","keep","it","in","japanes","water","with","which","to","jumpstart","a","new","godzilla","from","the","bone","of","a","old","dinosaur","onli","thei","do","not","have","to","becaus","a","leaki","old","nuclear","shipwreck","have","alreadi","make","godzilla","whole","again","oh","and","godzilla","final","get","to","tokyo","reunit","with","hi","old","armi","buddi","in","a","heartwarm","moment","of","tear","recognit","thei","look","into","each","other","ey","and","godzilla","nod","a","if","to","sai","gotta","do","it","man","the","tycoon","nod","in","understand","then","godzilla","blow","him","upbr","br","i","should","conjur","mention","here","that","in","order","to","prevent","godzilla","revamp","angri","self","from","fulfil","hi","destini","and","destroi","japan","the","japanes","girl","from","the","futur","go","back","to","the","futur","to","ask","for","help","from","ye","a","bald","white","man","probabl","becaus","he","piti","her","a","the","sole","asian","charact","from","the","have","centuri","he","agre","to","build","a","mechaghidora","and","send","it","back","to","the","so","that","togeth","thi","two","giant","monster","can","uh","fulfil","godzilla","destini","and","destroi","japan","in","a","wonder","nod","to","that","notori","selfwil","whip","head","the","girl","pilot","mechaghidora","have","troubl","control","the","joystickbr","br","thi","godzilla","suit","design","ow","much","to","the","sumo","hi","thigh","be","flabbi","enough","to","doubl","for","rush","limbaugh","and","hi","belli","and","chest","be","thick","and","ponder","but","ther

{"value":"There are several things wrong with this movie- Brenda Song's character being one of them. I do not believe that the girl is a lousy actor- I honestly don't. I believe she is given poor lines. She is just supposed to be, \"that vain, rich girl\", and while it is funny in the TV shows she plays in, it can't even get a dry laugh from me here.<br /><br />Either way, I really should have known what to expect when I sat down to watch this film.<br /><br />The movie was not that terrible...initially. Wendy's reaction to Shen was completely natural. I mean, how would you feel if a man, claiming to be a reincarnated monk, chased you around commanding you to wear a medallion and insisting that you were needed to fight \"the great evil\" and save the world? Which brings me to another point. I know this movie is entirely fiction, but it is still has a founding in Chinese culture. It seems like all of the \"warriors\" in Wendy's family line were women. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I doubt that the monks would've just been okay with that. Sure, maybe they could've worked it in somehow, but they offered no explanation whatsoever. By doing so, they just contributed to the many cheesy attempts at female empowerment made by Hollywood and the media.<br /><br />Nevermind that, however- let us continue.<br /><br />Wendy's character becomes more unbearable as the film go on. Yes, she is a teenager, and it is near homecoming- I mean, who wants to fight evil during homecoming? The problem is, when \"the evil\" starts to manifest himself, Wendy does not seem as freaked out as she should be. She is extremely careless- even for someone like her. She continues not to care about her training. I will use this conversation as an example, Shen: \"If you do not win this battle, evil will take over, and everything good will be gone.\" Wendy: \"Whoa, talk about pressure. Well...let's talk about something else.\" Yes, let's Wendy. Let's also go dancing when you should rightfully be training. Of course Shen lets her, but his character has an excuse. Better that he cooperate with her, than that he not, and she not train at all, and get them both killed.<br /><br />Oh, speaking of which. Shen also told Wendy that it was his destiny for him to die for her in battle, as he had for her great-grandmother (I am assuming that part).<br /><br />This makes Wendy's actions more unforgivable.<br /><br />As the script-writer would have it, Wendy's homecoming and this \"great battle\" are on exactly the same day. Do you know what Wendy does? Do you even have to guess? Yes, she does end up going to the battle, for when she tries to leave for homecoming, the monks, (who Shen had trapped in the body of her coach and teachers because she \"felt weird fighting an old man\") inform her that Shen has gone to battle alone, so she goes to save him.<br /><br />We initially see some half-decent fighting, that is actually entertaining. Until finally, the great evil comes out of Wendy's rival-for-homecoming's body, and creates the actual embodiment of himself out of the broken pieces of the bodies of his ancient warriors.<br /><br />Don't ask.<br /><br />Anyway, Wendy gets all \"panicky.\" Then Shen goes and defends her from this guy- forgive me for forgetting his long Chinese name- and manages to get himself killed.<br /><br />Wendy catches Shen as he makes his long descent from being thrust uncomfortably high into the air.<br /><br />She screams title of said article out.<br /><br />Now...it was bad enough that Wendy became powerful far, far too fast. No, I will not let it be excused because it was her \"destiny\" and she had \"the power within\" her.<br /><br />Since when, though, did she learn healing? No, worst...since when could she resurrect people? So Shen is raised from the dead. Then, Wendy and he fight the guy.<br /><br />He loses way to easily. The worst part, is when they jump together, and kick him at the same time, and he is banished forever. Then the monks commend Wendy on her sacrifice.<br /><br />Two things, #1: Don't the script writer and director know a battle needs a little more \"finesse\" to it? #2: What sacrifice? The fact that she didn't go to homecoming? Because the girl did not break a sweat, or even bleed. I mean, come on now, this movie was TV PG, I wanted to see somebody get hurt.<br /><br />Ah-hem...moving on.<br /><br />I know it sounds like maybe I should have given the movie a one, based on my comments. Part of critique, you must know, though, is breaking a thing down. You don't necessarily try to look for the bad, but if it's there, you bring attention to it. This movie has a lot of bad, but something funny happens when you never really expect something to be all too great in the first place.<br /><br />So, I suppose it was all right. Not that me not saying it wasn't all right would've stopped anybody from watching

{"value":"One of the most common entries in the 'goofs' category is anachronism. Though I'm beginning to believe that anachronism and other goofs are more acceptable, even ignored, in very good films, but are found front and center in rotten films. KISS THEM FOR ME is a rotten film and reeks of anachronism, yet when watching it closely, I found almost nothing specifically anachronistic.<br /><br />The shots of aircraft which bookend the film are certainly out of place. The big 4 engine transport seen after the title \"Honolulu 1944\" appears to be the post war C-97 Stratofreighter (in MATS colors). The combat planes seen taking off from the carrier at the end are Douglas Skyraiders which entered service after WW2 and were made famous by their service in Vietnam.<br /><br />But excepting these two pieces of film and, of course, the hairstyles, everything else is very possibly period authentic. It just 'feels' so wrong. I'm an admirer of Stanley Donen, we share the same birthday. In his co directed ON THE TOWN (1949) there is a car chase at the end with the police driving 1949/50 Ford's yet there isn't the slightest feeling that this is out of place in a WW2 period film. In fact, as I reflected later, there isn't anything which says that this is supposed to be a WW2 period film. It just feels that way. Based on a wartime Broadway musical which was based on a ballet (Fancy Free) which may have been based on the work of artist Paul Cadmus (The Fleet's In! 1934) its a great film about sailors on a 24 hour pass in New York and, so heavy with wartime associations, its merely assumed it takes place during the war and yet these contemporary cars do nothing to break the spell.<br /><br />The first problem is old Cary Grant. Though far too old to represent a Navy SBD dive bomber pilot, it is a Hollywood tradition for stars like Grant, Gary Cooper (Lou Gehrig), Jimmy Stewart (Charles Lindbergh) to play younger. It was the role which he is miscast in, not his age. He plays an operator, as they used to call them. A guy who gets things done and breaks all the rules while doing it yet remains admired and loved for it. A hustler. A wheeler dealer. A de rigueur character in a service comedy. Grant is the comic center of what is after all supposed to be a service comedy which is contra to his comedy style.<br /><br />Thinking back on the great Grant comic performances like BRINGING UP BABY (1938) or ARSENIC AND OLD LACE (1944) and he is the great reactor whose comedy is to be reduced by his context from dignity to a befuddled puddle of inert jelly. IN KISS THEM he is expected to be the comic spark plug which just isn't him. People had already been exposed to the type, most recently to comic Phil Silvers as Sgt. Bilko on television. The role would be perfected later by James Garner but here Grant just isn't funny and appears to be a bully getting his way by aggressively pushing his Cary Grantness rather than cajoling and finessing.<br /><br />But the thing which really stinks the place up with anachronism is the lead women. There can be no more echt 50s women than Suzy Parker and Jayne Mansfield. They are unique to the decade. Marilyn Monroe can be placed in a continuum with Carole Lombard and Marie Wilson and any number of dumb blonds, and Grace Kelly was another high class dame (think of Mary Astor), but there never could have been an anatomically exaggerated woman in films like Mansfield. Sure there were the 'sweater girls' (e.g. Lana Turner) of WW2, but Mansfield was stretching the point. Suzy Parker was THE model who revolutionized the model business, who changed the mannequin like poses to become the first natural girl who moved and whose personality was captured by the camera (see FUNNY FACE (1957) also by Stanley Donen).<br /><br />Of course in high 50s style, there seems to be a lot of gender mixing at 'wild' parties but never even a hint of sex (think of the 50s TV shows Bachelor Father or The Bob Cummings Show where dinner jacketed men returned from 'dates' alone). The original book, which I haven't read, was published during the war and appeared as a play on Broadway at the end of the war and the nuances of the situation must have been inescapable for contemporary readers and audiences, but broken down, bowdlerized and reconstituted a dozen years later and fatally miscast, it remains a once forgotten stain on otherwise exemplary careers until the invention of the VCR and cable television resurrected this petrified turkey.<br /><br />So the lesson here is whatever the 'goof' it will be ignored in a great film like CITIZEN KANE (who actually

{"value":"Scarecrow is set in the small American town of Emerald Grove where high school student Lester Dwervick (Tim Young) is considered the local nerdy geek by teachers & fellow students alike. The poor kid suffers daily humiliation, bullying, teasing & general esteem destroying abuse at the hands of his peers. Unfortunately he doesn't find much support at home since his mom is a slut & after Lester annoys one of her blokes he chases him into a corn field & strangles the poor kid. However something magical happens (no, the film doesn't suddenly become good), Lester's spirit gets transfered into the corn fields scarecrow which he then uses as a body to gain revenge on those who tormented him & made his life hell...<br /><br />Co-written, co-produced & directed by Emmanuel Itier who according to the IMDb credit list also has a role in the film as someone called Mr. Duforq although I don't remember any character of this name, I suppose anyone who ends up looking at the IMDb pages for Scarecrow will probably already be aware of it's terrible reputation & I have to say it pretty much well deserved since it's terrible. The script by Itier, Bill Cunningham & Jason White uses the often told story of one of life's losers who gets picked upon & tormented for no good reason getting their revenge by supernatural means in a relatively straight forward teen slasher flick. We've seen it all before, we've seen killer scarecrows before, we've seen faceless teens being killed off one-by-one before, we've seen one of life's losers get his revenge before, we've seen wise cracking villains who make jokes as they kill before & we've seen incompetent small town Sheriff's make matters even worse before. The only real question to answer about Scarecrow is whether it's any fun to watch on a dumb teen slasher type level? The answer is a resounding no to be honest. The film has terrible character's, awful dialogue, an inconsistent & predictable story, it has some cheesy one-liners like when the scarecrow kills someone with a shovel he ask's 'can you dig it?' & the so-called twist ending which is geared towards leaving things open for a sequel is just lame. The film moves along at a reasonable pace but it isn't that exciting & the kills are forgettable. You know I'm still trying to work out how someone can be stabbed & killed with a stick of corn...<br /><br />Director Itier doesn't do a particularly good job here, the kill scenes are poorly handled with no build up whatsoever which means there's never any tension as within two seconds of a character being introduced they are killed off. Also I'm not happy with the killer scarecrow dude doing all these back-flips & somersaults through the air in scenes which feel like they belong in The Matrix (1999) or some Japanese kung-fu flick! To give it some credit the actual scarecrow mask looks really good & he looks pretty cool but he is given little to do except spout bad one-liners & twirl around a bit. Don't you think that being tied to a wooden stake in the middle of a corn filed all day would have been boring? I know he's a killer scarecrow but I still say he would have been bored just hanging around on a wooden stick all day! There's no nudity & the gore isn't anything to write home about, there's a decapitation, someones face is burnt, someone is killed with a stick of corn, someone gets a shovel stuck in their throat, some sickles are stuck in people's heads, someone has their heart ripped out & someone has a metal thing stuck through the back of their head which comes out of their mouth.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $250,000 this was apparently shot in 8 days, well at least they didn't waste any time on unimportant things like story & character development. Technically this is pretty much point, shoot & hope for the best stuff. If you look at the guy on the floor who has just had his heart ripped out you can clearly see him still breathing... The acting sucks, the guy who played Lester's mum's bloke is wearing the most stupid looking wig & fake moustache ever because he played two roles in the film & the makers needed to disguise him but they just ended up making him look ridiculous & don't get me started on his accent...<br /><br />Scarecrow has a few fun moments & the actual scarecrow himself is a nice creation with good special make-up effects but as a whole the film is poorly made, badly acted, silly, too predictable & very cheesy. If you want to see a great killer scarecrow flick then check out Scarecrows (1988). Not to be confused with the Gene Hackman & Al Pacino film Scarecrow (1973) or the upcoming horror flick Scarecrow (2008) which is currently in production. Scarecrow proved popular enough on home video to spawn two more straight to video sequels, Scarecrow Slayer (2003) & Scarecrow Gone Wild

{"value":"For years Madonna has tried to prove not only herself, but the public eye, that she can act. Unfortunately, trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona doesn't mix well.<br /><br />She seems to fare better when she's NOT the star of any movie: if you watch her in supporting performances in DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN (1985) or A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN (1992), she actually comes off looking good. Since the story revolves on other actors, the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by default.<br /><br />The trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie, regardless the genre. Being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way, whether it be good, mediocre or plain awful, she has to emote in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance. This is the crucial difference between Madonna and, let's say, Bette Davis, or Meryl Streep. The latter two, even if the movie were to fail (because the visual storytelling lacked some effectiveness in having us relate to it, or because the script fell short, or because the actress per se was just not at her moment), there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb. Both Davis and Streep have had their share: Bette, having a longer career than Streep, in such fare as BUNNY O'HARE (1971) and WICKED STEPMOTHER (1989); Streep in SHE-DEVIL (1989). But at least there's been that naturalism in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the banality of the movie and watch the performance.<br /><br />Madonna, on the other hand, not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself, fares much worse, and even in the hands of someone as Woody Allen in SHADOWS AND FOG (1992), an inferior classic, she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff, maybe even nervous, as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just couldn't let go.<br /><br />So here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a two-character movie. Guy Ritchie, more known for action movies filled in masculine energy, seems as adrift telling a story closer to someone of the likes of Michaelangelo Antonioni or Ingmar Bergman, who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease. And at 89 minutes, the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn, it doesn't feel sincere. From being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love, this has to be the most unconvincing 180 degree turn since Fay Dunaway's Laura suddenly discovered her passion for Tommy Lee Jones in THE EYES OF LAURA MARS (1978). Equally unconvincing is Adriano Giannini's nasty turn around the middle of the movie -- it lacks any humor and feels genuinely psychopathic -- and when he gives in to Madonna's love, it's too quick to be believed. Filming this in slow music and a visual montage of lovemaking and beautiful scenery doesn't enhance or add upon this \"transformation\" from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other.<br /><br />Trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well -- it only makes it drag, bog it down, and when Madonna has to be filmed going from hope to devastation in a tight close-up, it feels she's trying too hard. Many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little. Hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late 20s, early 30s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion.<br /><br />Could the movie have been better? Of course. There are a myriad of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again -- it's been done before, in OVERBOARD (1987), for example. It could have had an existential undertone in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change (to ensure a moral tone). Much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been spared for a more \"silent\" film look -- as in PERSONA (1966). It could have even been something of a thriller, providing that the Giannini character have a mean streak as Billy Zane had in DEAD CALM (1989). Even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for Madonna as the over the top, uber-control freak getting her comeuppance. But with its mean streaked humor, without at least a glimpse of her character having a softer side that hides behind a mask of bitchdom, and without really defining Giannini's own character, this

{"value":"Consider for a moment what it must be like to be Uwe Boll. Somewhere, perhaps in those places that Jack Nicholson said 'you don't talk about at parties', Boll knows that David Lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him. Gore Whores, metal-heads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the Teutonic helmsman's output so bereft of originality, wit or imagination that he's become the internet's bogeyman  an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement. Boll does his best to ride over these naysayers, exploiting tax credits available in Germany and Canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as Zero Mostel did with old ladies in The Producers. The difference being that Mostel's character knew he was making bowel fill. Maybe Uwe knows it too.<br /><br />Such is the level of hostility toward each new 'Bollbuster' that IMDb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting 1 before they've seen it. Boll's attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined. Indeed he's probably the only filmmaker that's boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbage.<br /><br />This onslaught has made Uwe a very thick skinned man, so much so that he must feel like he's wrapped in a carpet, but one who feels as if he's bullied by the entire world. Like most people in that situation he lashes out, determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding Variety's review of House of the Dead, never too far from the surface. This 'I know you are but what am I' strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of Postal, which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about 9/11, Christian fundamentalism, Jihad, Nazism and paedophilia. Such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of Peter Cook and the visual imagination of Chris Morris but the closest Boll gets to either man is the o in their surname.<br /><br />In Seed, shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation, Boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer (is there any other kind?) who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life. Mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free, though if you'd been fried with that much electricity why would you want to, they pronounce him legally dead and bury him, only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolers.<br /><br />Boll begins his 'exploration of nihilistic rage' with Seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes. From there we're treated to the killer's stock in trade  kidnapping dogs, babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food. We're invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are  our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition. Yes, we're worthless, gormless sadists and worse than that, we won't give Uwe a good rating on the IMDb. In short, humanity is bunk.<br /><br />Of course you might think that Uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind it's a bit of a bipolar piece, on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness  the milk that poor old Boll has had to drink for so long, while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girth.<br /><br />The result says nothing about society and its discontents, more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director. Poor Uwe is obviously a very angry man  one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair, no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasy's about dispatching various web critics. That it's there but takes an avant-garde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread, shows that Boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements. He's made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate. \"I wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun\" Boll told the audience at the film's world premiere and he has, on that flimsy manifesto, succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the director's detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker, he'll need something genuine to say as well as a better, more original way of saying it.","finished_norm":["consid","for","a","moment","what","it","must","be","like","to","be","uw","boll","somewher","perhap","in","that","place","that","jack","nicholson","sai","you","do","not","talk","about","at","parti","boll","know","that","david","lean","have","head","lous","a","a","child","that","have","much","talent","for","film","make","than","him","gore","whore","metalhead","and","the","social","dysfunct","mai","bump","into","him","on","the","circuit","and","tell","him","otherwis","but","gener","audienc","find","the","teuton","helmsman","output","so","bereav","of","origin","wit","or","imagin","that","he","becom","the","internet","bogeyman","a","onlin","discurs","synonym","for","photochem","excrem","boll","doe","hi","well","to","ride","over","thi","naysay","exploit","tax","credit","avail","in","germani","and","canada","to","keep","work","and","rais","monei","from","a","network","of","dentist","a","zero","mostel","do","with","old","ladi","in","the","produc","the","differ","be","that","mostel","charact","know","he","be","make","bowel","fill","mayb","uw","know","it","toobr","br","such","be","the","level","of","hostil","toward","each","new","bollbust","that","imdb","patron","sabotag","their","rate","by","vote","befor","thei","have","see","it","boll","attempt","at","silenc","hi","critic","by","challeng","them","to","a","box","match","and","knock","them","out","just","make","them","much","determin","ind","he","probabl","the","onli","filmmak","that","boost","thesauru","sale","a","critic","search","for","invent","wai","of","describ","garbagebr","br","thi","onslaught","have","make","uw","a","veri","thick","skin","man","so","much","so","that","he","must","feel","like","he","wrap","in","a","carpet","but","on","who","feel","a","if","he","bulli","by","the","entir","world","like","much","peopl","in","that","situat","he","lash","out","determin","to","upset","a","mani","peopl","a","possibl","with","the","memori","of","a","tear","even","hold","varieti","review","of","hous","of","the","dead","never","too","far","from","the","surfac","thi","i","know","you","be","but","what","be","i","strategi","for","reclaim","the","initi","produc","the","blunt","satir","of","postal","which","attempt","to","napalm","the","dissent","with","joke","about","christian","fundament","jihad","nazism","and","paedophilia","such","a","litani","of","invect","requir","a","satirist","with","the","mind","of","peter","cook","and","the","visual","imagin","of","chri","morri","but","the","close","boll","get","to","either","man","be","the","o","in","their","surnamebr","br","in","se","shoot","back","to","back","with","the","aforement","game","adapt","boll","be","back","with","a","stori","about","a","sadist","serial","murder","be","there","ani","other","kind","who","get","the","chair","onli","for","two","attempt","to","fail","in","perman","curtail","all","sign","of","life","mind","of","the","fiction","law","that","sai","anyon","still","aliv","after","attempt","must","go","free","though","if","you","have","be","fry","with","that","much","electr","why","would","you","want","to","thei","pronounc","him","legal","dead","and","buri","him","onli","for","the","disgruntl","killer","to","resurfac","and","begin","a","whirlwind","tour","of","hi","gaolersbr","br","boll","begin","hi","explor","of","nihilist","rage","with","se","watch","footag","of","anim","be","tortur","for","experiment","purpos","from","there","we","re","treat","to","the","killer","stock","in","trade","kidnap","dog","babi","and","grow","woman","and","allow","them","to","starv","to","death","on","camera","onli","to","becom","maggot","food","we","re","invit","to","reflect","on","what","a","deprav","race","of","amor","meat","sack","we","all","be","our","inhuman","to","each","other","and","our","fellow","creatur","act","a","a","light","rod","that","act","a","a","catalyst","for","the","much","disgust","vestig","of","the","human","condit","ye","we","re","worthless","gormless","sadist","and","wrong","than","that","we","wo","not","give","uw","a","good","rate","on","the","imdb","in","short","human","be","bunkbr","br","of","cours","you","mai","think","that","uw","reli","on","our","wrong","excess","for","hi","livelihood","and","with","that","in","mind","it","a","bite","of","a","bipolar","piec","on","on","hand","hate","it","audienc","and","posit","bast","itself","in","the","sour","milk","of","human","kind","the","milk","that","poor","old","boll","have","have","to","drink","for","so","long","while","simultan","whip","out","it","member","and","invit","that","with","a","pornograph","lust","for","on","screen","deprav","to","marvel","at","it","sheer","ars","split","girthbr","br","the","result","sai","noth","about","societi","and","it","discont","much","the","corros","effect","bad","press","be","have","on","it","director","poor","uw","be","obvious","a","veri","angri","man","on","scene","in","which","a","poor","woman","get","her","brain","hammer","to","a","pulp","while","tie","to","a","chair","no","doubt","a","surrog","for"

{"value":"Hollywood now has officially gone too far and I really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine backlash against their crap machines, in spite of the good box office returns. If you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next, STOP. Stop making our TV shows into these repellent, stupid, money grubbing waste of time movies that suck. By doing so you are proving one thing: Hollywood is out of ideas, and going to see the movies they churn out only perpetuates the cycle of disgust. What's next -- You guys gonna go & ruin The Bionic Man??<br /><br />The film is just plain wrong, and manages to get the most stupid, simple fact of the show totally incorrect by forgetting (or ignoring) that Tom Wopat & John Schneider's Bo & Luke Duke were *REFORMED* moonshiners. They had been busted, learned their lesson, gone straight, and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite tipped arrows from hunting bows & drive like Steve McQueen. Denver Pyle's Uncle Jessie was also the moral center of the family, always insisting that the Boys do good, even at their own expense or embarrassment while he made sandwiches and coffee for when the chores were done. They always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naiveté about them that was quite appealing. We wanted to be more like them than we were, sorta. My favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belts before roaring off, which was apparently too moral for this film.<br /><br />By transforming the Duke family into a pack of leering, wisecracking, criminally minded, redneck baiting, misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint, where the show was all about how honest or incorruptible the Dukes were -- Are the Duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys? I wanted to punch them both in the nose. They seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing chores back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends, if not acting like a pair of 14 year old boys who haven't grown up. There should be no marijuana use, no gawking at buxom, nubile coeds & their breasts, no shenanigans involving the Brothers in da Hood. All of it looks like the work of a marketing consultant who took a poll at the mall of what 14 year old boys like to see in movies. The problem being that 14 year old boys cannot possibly remember the show, IMHO shouldn't be seeing this movie either, and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers, director & producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money, which is exactly how I feel. What were they thinking???<br /><br />And boy did they *EVER* get Daisy wrong. Jessica Simpson all dolled up like a Pamela Anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace, but you can service your needs just fine downloading some promotional stills of her, printing them up & pinning them to the wall in a restroom. She is hardly in the film at all (which is the movie's only saving grace), and the ten minutes or so they used her was STILL excessive. Catherine Bach's Daisy may have had the same kind of shorts, and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her, but the Daisy she played was a *PERSON*. The pratfalls she elicited by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it. She remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home. And most importantly she was a sweet, caring person who couldn't help it if the guys went Ga Ga over her.<br /><br />By contrast, Jessica Simpson appears phony, contrived, made up, costumed, posed, aloof, bored, out of place, and I don't think she even looks that great in the outfit. She doesn't look like a person but a plot device, conjured up during a deal with someone representing her agent. Ms. Simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened. Whatever the joke was, she isn't in on it and is disgracefully exploited for T&A. If that's all she wants from her career, executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least, because this effort was just pathetic.<br /><br />The bottom line is SKIP IT. For the cost of two tickets and a Slurpee to go you can pick up one of Warner Bros. excellent box set collections of the original shows on DVD and the entire family can watch them together. That was why it worked. The only real purpose I can see in the film might be it's future use as an interrogation tool at Guantanamo Bay. Twenty minutes of this & they'll be singing a choir.<br /><br />1/10, and I mean it.

{"value":"Are you familiar with concept of children's artwork? While it is not the greatest Picasso any three-year-old has ever accomplished with their fingers, you encourage them to do more. If painting is what makes them happy, there should be no reason a parent should hold that back on a child. Typically, if a child loves to paint or draw, you will immediately see the groundwork of their future style. You will begin to see their true form in these very primitive doodles. Well, this concept of children's artwork is how I felt about Fuqua's depressingly cheap and uncreative film Bait. While on all accounts it was a horrid film, it was impressive to see Fuqua's style begin emerging through even the messiest of moments. If you have seen either Training Day or King Arthur, you will be impressed with the birth of this director in his second film Bait. While Foxx gives a horrid, unchained performance, there are certain scenes, which define Fuqua and demonstrate his brilliance behind the camera. Sadly it only emerged in the final thirty minutes of the film, but if you focus just on those scenes, you will see why Fuqua's name appears on so many \"Best Of\" film lists.<br /><br />I will never disagree with someone that Fuqua's eye behind the camera is refreshing and unique. His ability to place a camera in the strangest of places to convey the simplest of emotions is shocking. I am surprised that more of Hollywood hasn't jumped aboard this bandwagon. Even in the silly feature Bait, you are witness to Fuqua's greatness. Two scenes that come directly to mind are the explosion scene near the middle of the film and the horse scene close to the end. In both of these scenes I saw the director Fuqua at work. Alas, in the rest of this film, all I saw was a combination of nearly every action film created. The likable hero down on his luck that suddenly finds his life turned around by some unknown force is a classic structure that just needs to die in Hollywood. We have seen this two often, and no matter who you are (unless you are Charlie Kaufmann), you cannot recreate the wheel. It is just impossible with this genre, and it is proved with Bait. I was annoyed with Fuqua for just sitting back and allowing this to happen, which could explain why it took me three viewings to finish this film. I was just tired of the structure, and while I hoped that Fuqua would redefine it, he did not.<br /><br />Then, there was the acting. While Jamie Foxx has never impressed me as an actor, I was willing to give this helmed vehicle a try. I wanted to see if he could pull off another dramatic role similar to Collateral. I was under the impression that perhaps this was the film chosen to show producers that Foxx could handle the role in Collateral. Again, I was disappointed. Foxx was annoying. Not in the sense that it was the way that his character was to be, but in the sense that it felt as if neither Fuqua nor Foxx took the time to fully train Foxx on what should be ad-libed and what should be used to further the plot. Instead, we are downtrodden with scene over scene of Foxx just trying to make the audience laugh. Adding second long quips and culture statements just to keep his audience understanding that he was a comedian first, an actor second. Fuqua should have stopped this immediately. Foxx's jokes destroyed his character, which in turn left me with nothing solid to grasp ahold of. Instead of character development, he would crack a joke. Neither style worked, no joke was funny. The rest of the cast was average. By this I mean I have seen them all in similar roles. They were brining nothing new to the table, nothing solid to the story, and nothing substantial to the overall themes of the film. They were pawns filling in dead air space. Fuqua had no control over this mess, and the final verdict only supports that accusation.<br /><br />Overall, this was a sad film. With no creativity in sight and unmanaged actors just trying to upstage themselves, what originally started as a decent story eventually sunk faster into the cinematic quicksand. Foxx was annoying, without character lines, and a complete bag of cheese. In each scene I saw no emotion, and when emotion was needed to convey a message, he chose to take his shirt off rather than tackle the issues. Are my words harsh? I don't think so. When you watch any movie you want to see some creativity, some edible characters, and themes that seem to hit close to home. Bait contained none of these. While I will give Fuqua some credit for two of the scenes in this film, the remaining five hundred were disastrous. Apparently, I took the bait when renting this film, but now having seen it, hopefully I can stop others from taking that curious nibble.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of ***** (for his two scenes that were

{"value":"Paul Armstrong is a liberal, Scottish-born, professor of law at Harvard, known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty, who is hired to take on the case of Bobby Earl, a young black man from Florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of Joanie Shriver, an eleven year old white girl. Earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is Blair Sullivan, a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders. Armstrong visits Sullivan in his cell on death row, hoping to persuade him to confess to Joanie's murder, thereby saving Earl from the electric chair. <br /><br />At first all goes well. Sullivan confesses and Earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction. As this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film, it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer. \"Warning! Major plot twist ahead!\" And so it proves. The anticipated twist soon materialises. Earl, it transpires, is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted, and probably of several others as well, but hatched a diabolical plan together with Sullivan in order to secure his freedom; Sullivan will confess to Joanie's murder if Earl will murder his parents. (Just why Sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained). Armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved; Earl has a grudge against Armstrong's wife, herself a lawyer, who acted as Counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when Earl was accused of rape. <br /><br />\"Just Cause\" is an example of the auto-cannibalism in which Hollywood sometimes likes to indulge, cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others. The first half owes an obvious debt to films like \"Intruder in the Dust\" and \"To Kill a Mockingbird\"; about the only difference is that the Sheriff who beats a confession out of Bobby Earl is himself black, whereas in earlier films he would have been white. (Police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity). The central twist in the plot was borrowed from Costa-Gavras's \"Music Box\", although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end. The finale, in which a lawyer, his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client, is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of \"Cape Fear\", which also take place in the swamplands of the American South. Ed Harris' characterisation of Sullivan as a Bible-quoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of Robert de Niro's character in the Scorsese version of \"Cape Fear\", made four years before \"Just Cause\". <br /><br />(There is a postscript. Just as \"Just Cause\" borrowed heavily from several other movies, seven years later its central plot twist was, in its turn, to be blatantly plagiarised in the Ashley Judd vehicle \"High Crimes\"). <br /><br />The trouble with this style of film-making-by-numbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them. The whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts, and \"Just Cause\" is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it. Harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances, largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de Niro playing Max Cady. Blair Underwood is OK as Bobby Earl the (supposedly) innocent young man of the early scenes, but unconvincing as Bobby Earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones. Sean Connery as Armstrong and Laurence Fishburne as the black Sheriff are rather better, but neither is good enough to save the film. (Connery and Harris were to act together in another, better, film, \"The Rock\", the following year). <br /><br />There is another problem with \"Just Cause\". The first half of the film looks like a standard liberal \"issue\" movie, anti-death penalty, anti-racist and critical of heavy-handed policing. The second half looks more like the work of a die-hard reactionary, preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards, that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair, that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes. The filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the (presumably unwanted) effect of reversing its political stance, or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it. A suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency.

{"value":"There is NOTHING cool, hip, or clever about this film-- liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema. How can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean & ugly people are . . . SERIAL KILLERS! If they have to dismember total strangers in order to \"be a family again,\" then we don't WANT them to \"be a family.\" What part of that did you have trouble grasping? Why applaud this filth?<br /><br />THIS silly filth is what you do if you can't do art! One's head & life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as \"interesting.\" This is a camera without a brain. What really makes an artwork cool is profundity, questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history (or, in this case, a knowledge of ANYTHING would be preferable!). Instead, this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown, thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as \"cool cause it's so far OUT, man!\"). These same violent events actually HAPPEN, every day. They are NOT \"just in the film.\" They refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to YOU. Do you WANT those things done to you? A child could have thought this up, it required zero imagination, it is NOT surrealism. This lazy crap has no content, is saying nothing--it's just the worst of the evening news, & it is saying nothing new, nothing we don't already know. It's \"the emperor's new clothes,\" the director hoping there are enough uneducated children, proud of their streak of inhumanity, for this sloppy filth to fly. I can see director Miike's demented fans now: chain-smoking teens-and- twenties drunks covered in tattoos, with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces, their knowledge-base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves .<br /><br />There is NO PLOT to this--it is just sheer exploitation of shock-value violence. There is no \"hidden meaning\" anywhere in this poorly made film. It is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic, BUT you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not THERE! To DO that you need to view & review a REAL piece of cinema. There are PLENTY out there, directed by Fellini, Bergman, Fassbinder, Herzog, Altman, Bunuel, Kurosawa, Lynch, Tarkovsky, Peter Greenaway, Tarantino, Guillermo del Toro, Richard Linklater, Eisenstein, Aronofsky, Gus van Sant, Soderbergh, Shyamalan, Ordet. Why don't you view a REAL art film by the likes of these giants? This wannabe director, Miike, will NEVER make a film equal to one of the geniuses I just listed because he just doesn't have the talent! Anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like \"Visitor Q.\" Teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon! There's no message, no meaning, no plot, nothing to it at all. There are long lists of ART Films to learn from--but THIS \"Visitor Q\" is NOT an art film in any respect. It has no content to it. It's just one banal horror piled onto another, and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things HAPPEN, every single day, somewhere in the world. They are NOT okay because they are \"just in the film.\" They refer to actual soul-less people who would do those same things to YOU. Do you WANT those things done to you? To others? Why? Because this world is already ugly enough, thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this. <br /><br />There are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct, but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap. There IS no deeper meaning. There is nothing to analyze; why keep trying? I've spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made, and keeping up with all the new ones, but I've never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this. It's not imaginative or even shocking, because these types of events happen daily all over the world. To make this film, or even to favorably review it, has caused over 50 young airheads who don't know any better to think it's \"cool.\" They may grow up thinking that, convincing others, some of whom may end up DOING these things--convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way, by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity. Trust me on this,--I know cool, and cool this piece of crap AIN'T. Visitor Q has the FEEL of a genuine SNUFF film, and I'm still not sure it isn't, actually. <br /><br />Your actions have consequences, son. The world is awful enough already. Some violence like this COULD happen to YOU, or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this FAKE Art film. Believe me, you won't be thinking it's \"Cool\" when someone is sawing YOUR skull in half!","finished_norm":["there","be","noth","cool","hip","or","clever","about","thi","film","like","it","just","reveal","a","ignor","of","true","art","cinema","how","can","you","so","easili","forget","that","the","central","fact","of","thi","entir","film","be","that","thi","mean","ugli","peopl","be","serial","killer","if","thei","have","to","dismemb","total","stranger","in","order","to","be","a","famili","again","then","we","do","not","want","them","to","be","a","famili","what","part","of","that","do","you","have","troubl","grasp","why","applaud","thi","filthbr","br","thi","silli","filth","be","what","you","do","if","you","ca","not","do","art","on","head","life","must","be","deepli","empti","to","mistak","thi","shallow","vicious","a","interest","thi","be","a","camera","without","a","brain","what","realli","make","a","artwork","cool","be","profund","question","the","statu","quo","from","a","perspect","inform","by","a","knowledg","of","histori","or","in","thi","case","a","knowledg","of","anyth","would","be","prefer","instead","thi","be","just","randomli","pile","up","the","ugli","imag","avail","in","a","world","in","meltdown","thank","to","just","the","sort","of","empti","mean","glorifi","a","cool","caus","it","so","far","out","man","thi","same","violent","event","actual","happen","everi","dai","thei","be","not","just","in","the","film","thei","refer","to","actual","soulless","peopl","who","would","do","that","same","thing","to","you","do","you","want","that","thing","do","to","you","a","child","can","have","think","thi","up","it","requir","zero","imagin","it","be","not","surreal","thi","lazi","crap","have","no","content","be","sai","nothingit","just","the","wrong","of","the","even","new","it","be","sai","noth","new","noth","we","do","not","alreadi","know","it","the","emperor","new","cloth","the","director","hope","there","be","enough","uneduc","child","proud","of","their","streak","of","inhuman","for","thi","sloppi","filth","to","fly","i","can","see","director","miik","dement","fan","now","chainsmok","teensand","twenti","drunk","cover","in","tattoo","with","metal","hang","from","hole","punch","in","their","face","their","knowledgebas","invers","proport","to","their","intellig","estim","of","themselv","br","br","there","be","no","plot","to","thisit","be","just","sheer","exploit","of","shockvalu","violenc","there","be","no","hide","mean","anywher","in","thi","poorli","make","film","it","be","fine","to","explor","a","film","to","see","if","you","can","find","cinemat","devic","that","be","ingeni","artist","but","you","cannot","uncov","a","hide","mean","if","on","be","not","there","to","do","that","you","ne","to","view","review","a","real","piec","of","cinema","there","be","plenti","out","there","direct","by","fellini","bergman","fassbind","herzog","altman","bunuel","kurosawa","lynch","tarkovski","peter","greenawai","tarantino","guillermo","del","toro","richard","linklat","eisenstein","aronofski","gu","van","sant","soderbergh","shyamalan","ordet","why","do","not","you","view","a","real","art","film","by","the","like","of","thi","giant","thi","wannab","director","miik","will","never","make","a","film","equal","to","on","of","the","geniu","i","just","list","becaus","he","just","doe","not","have","the","talent","anyon","can","slap","togeth","some","chaotic","crap","like","visitor","q","teenag","can","throw","that","togeth","in","on","afternoon","there","no","messag","no","mean","no","plot","noth","to","it","at","all","there","be","long","list","of","art","film","to","learn","frombut","thi","visitor","q","be","not","a","art","film","in","ani","respect","it","have","no","content","to","it","it","just","on","banal","horror","pile","onto","anoth","and","the","point","to","rememb","about","that","hideou","crime","be","that","that","thing","happen","everi","singl","dai","somewher","in","the","world","thei","be","not","okai","becaus","thei","be","just","in","the","film","thei","refer","to","actual","soulless","peopl","who","would","do","that","same","thing","to","you","do","you","want","that","thing","do","to","you","to","other","why","becaus","thi","world","be","alreadi","ugli","enough","thank","to","peopl","who","enjoi","think","about","horrif","event","like","thi","br","br","there","be","sooooo","mani","art","film","out","there","to","us","your","mind","to","deconstruct","but","you","be","wast","your","talent","with","thi","piec","of","crap","there","be","no","deep","mean","there","be","noth","to","analyz","why","keep","try","i","have","spend","nearli","year","watch","practic","everi","film","ever","make","and","keep","up","with","all","the","new","on","but","i","have","never","see","anyth","a","disgustingli","pointless","a","thi","it","not","imagin","or","even","shock","becaus","thi","typ","of","event","happen","daili","all","over","the","world","to","make","thi","film","or","even","to","favor","review","it","have","caus","over","young","airhead","who","do","not","know","ani","well","to","think","it","cool","thei","mai

{"value":"(Only minor spoilers except as noted).<br /><br />I've enjoyed a lot of Spanish cinema recently; both the actual Spanish cinema of people like Almodovar, and the Latin American cinema of directors like del Toro, whose superb \"Devil's Backbone\", set in Civil War Spain, was the finest horror film of the last decade. It's no surprise, then, that this film is both well-made, well-acted, and manages to sustain that distinctively different Spanish atmosphere. But it's also as nasty and pointless a film as one could hope not to have to see.<br /><br />What actually is the purpose of all this? We have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree, despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice-over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal. In a routinely unpleasant opening sequence, set more than a decade earlier, we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control-freakery (\"if I can't have you nobody can.\"). Oddly enough, that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film, but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree, which appears completely different in both motivation and execution. What happened to him in jail to cause this change? We have no idea, though we do later discover, as an absurd sort of afterthought, that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned.<br /><br />In Britain, in several of our notorious \"serial killer\" or \"sex killer\" cases, the terrible question arises; what about the wife? Did she know, or suspect what was going on? This is a question that this film could have asked, and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters. But banally, the answer to the question is quite clearly: \"No, she didn't\". Even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate, the film still manages to bungle it. All we actually get, sketched perfunctorily out at the end, is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event. Compare this to the awful revelatory moment in Ten Rillington Place, where Christie's wife says \"you know what I mean.\" thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror.<br /><br />(Major spoiler in this paragraph). In the meantime, we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police, thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again. How exactly did he achieve this? The plot gets extremely sketchy at this point; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police; but how this all works or why, or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds, remains a mystery.<br /><br />I actually don't believe serial killers are like this. The Silence of the Lambs may be comic book stuff, but  Lecter aside  it gets its serial killers right. They are deeply disturbed, deeply dysfunctional, deeply inadequate people; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here (closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of The Last Horror Movie, or indeed even Man Bites Dog, though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire).<br /><br />This film has little suspense, and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated. It has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers, either generally, or in the specific cultural milieu of Spain. This is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women. And oddly, what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented. The soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory. Just one explicit shot, properly timed, would have been infinitely more shocking, and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary, freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation. Instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear. Very, very creepy. I'm sorry to be rude; I love horror films, and can tolerate even the most extreme, to the extent even of worrying my partner. But I think anyone who finds this film good, or interesting, even I'd find myself edging away from. The purpose of a horror film is to scare you; this is just lascivious.<br /><br />It leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed. I have to give this film more than one star just because it's competently executed, but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been

{"value":"I just got the UK 4-disc special edition of Superman 1 for about $5. The additional stuff includes the 1951 feature Superman and the Mole-Men. So I slapped it into the DVD player last night, and here are my findings.<br /><br />Some initial disappointment - I hadn't checked, and I think I had it mentally tagged as one of the Kirk Alyn serials. I'm not a huge fan of George Reeves as Superman, and I hadn't seen anything other than the odd clip of Kirk Alyn - but hey ho, never mind.<br /><br />This black and white production runs for less than an hour. It has the feel of a couple of episodes of one of Reeves' early TV series, a two-parter, put together for cinema release, although IMDb says it was filmed as a cinema release in advance of the first TV series. In any event, it's an odd choice for reasons I'll get to later. I'm of an age where I recall TV and movie productions which are limited to one or two locations and sets, so there were no major surprises here. Even so, for a low budget movie, this one is REALLY low budget.<br /><br />The story concerns the small town of Silsby - population 1,430 - which, puzzlingly, is also home to the world's deepest oil well (6 miles). The story opens with the well's foreman hurriedly taking steps to close the well down. This conflicts with the arrival of Metropolis reporters Kent and Lane to report on the well, at the behest of the oil company. As Clark is sniffing out the fact that the drill has emerged into a radioactive cavern 6 miles down, a couple of odd little guys (small in stature, big in head, black in jumpsuit, and bushy in eyebrow) emerge from the capped-off drillshaft, and start mooching round town with puzzled expressions on their faces.<br /><br />A deep breath now, here is the remaining plot of the picture. The little guys scare some kids, so Jeff Corey (playing the town's rampant xenophobe) incites some pals to kill these \"creatures\". Superman steps in (moderately ineffectually) and catches one of the little guys who has been shot and takes him to the local hospital. Corey's pals burn down the shack the other little fellow has hidden in and assume he is killed, but he escapes and legs it down the shaft. Corey incites a lynch mob (despite the sheriff arresting him) to hang the hospitalised Mole-Man. Superman stops them entering the hospital and takes the injured chappie to the shaft to return him to his fellows. A total of 4 Mole-Men emerge with a weapon of some sort which they fire at Jeff Corey (I call this an Aargh! gun because its sole effect seems to be to make Corey go \"Aargh!\") and Superman saves him. He immediately changes his ways because of amazement at Superman saving him after the way he has behaved, the Mole-men go back down the shaft. The end.<br /><br />Despite the film only being an hour long, there is an inordinate amount of creeping around, bewareing and pursuing - I have left out all the \"Mole-Man 1 creeps from A to B, looking out to make sure no-one is following him\" stuff. The Mole-Men are never engaged in any way whatsoever - they have no dialogue - they just turn up, get persecuted, and go back. They do look a little creepy, but they are hardly the bug-eyed monsters that the town's reaction implies.<br /><br />Reeves is quite a good Clark Kent - very much a hard-nosed reporter, much more so than Phyllis Coates' rather indifferent Lois Lane. But he is a terrible, terrible Superman. Not only does he not look the part (at least his hair is dyed black in this, which is an improvement from the rather light hair he sported in some of the TV episodes), the way he plays it is all wrong in my book. I'm sure he was told to \"strike the pose\" (which Superman does constantly), but someone should have told him that it should be fists on hips, not fists on ribs. And he plays Superman as a rather strict and touchy schoolteacher - he doesn't actually wag his finger in remonstration, but he may as well have done.<br /><br />And Superman does a huge amount of walking around (I say a huge amount - he isn't actually in it all that much), and a bit of running. He takes off and lands a couple of times, but isn't seen in flight at any point. Oh, some bullets bounce off him, and he uses telescopic vision as Clark, but with no accompanying visual effect. In fact, visual effects are conspicuous by their absence, and the few which are present aren't very good.<br /><br />I've tried to consider this effort by reference to the standards of the time: but even by those standards I think it's a pretty threadbare effort. Thankfully, production standards on the TV series were higher, and at least they took the trouble to come up with stories which had a bit more to them.<br /><br />Something of a disappointment - I shan't be watching it

{"value":"Funny that I find myself forced to review this movie, but here I am.<br /><br />I am reviewing it, because just recently, I have had the chance to witness the revival of R.C. Sheriff's play \"Journey's End\" on stage in New York, at the Belasco Theatre, starring Hugh Darcy, Boyd Gaines, Jefferson Mays and others, as well as being masterfully directed by David Grindley.<br /><br />I left the theater shattered. I am not exaggerating, I was flabbergasted. After almost two and a half hours of a recreated and very claustrophobic depiction of soldier's life in the trenches of the Somme (I speculate), during World War One, brought to life vividly, by everyone involved, I came out of the theater with the shakes.<br /><br />Mind you, I am not easily shocked, nor am I too sensitive. I am a stage actor and a director myself, so I know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects, both emotionally, as well as psychologically.<br /><br />But what I had just witnessed, came so much to life, that I had chills in my spine as I left.<br /><br />None of these emotions came to life, while watching \"Aces High\", the movie based on this play and even adapted for the screen, in cooperation with R.C. Sheriff himself, shortly before he died.<br /><br />The screen adaptation takes place in the skies over France. So, gone is the claustrophobic ambiance to start with.<br /><br />The only plus of the movie, are the aerial battle scenes, which look dated in their special effects, compared to today's standards, but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on screen.<br /><br />Granted there had been a couple of screen adaptations of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" by Erich Maria Remarque, which takes place in trenches, and not in the sky, but that was the \"German\" vision on things, if one would like to be picky on such things.<br /><br />\"Journey's End\" is just the other side of the medal, and would have made it into a great movie, if they had left it alone and intact.<br /><br />The transfer on DVD is poor, even though in Widescreen and adapted for 16:9 TV screens, the quality of the film itself is that of a movie theater. Nothing more, nothing less. It sports various defects, such as minor scratches and dots, although the copy, for the rest, is clean.<br /><br />If you want another WWI movie in your collection, especially for those who love and enjoy to see aerial battles among old-timers, then this is a picture for you. But I rather would suggest \"Von Richthofen and Brown\" as an alternative, although that too, is a movie filled with inaccuracies.<br /><br />For the rest of you, who love good acting and drama, I would leave this one out. Buy the play. Go watch the play, if you have the chance to get a decent revival of it near you, but keep off this would-be adaptation.<br /><br />It is an anti-war movie, granted, but the weakest I have ever seen in my lifetime ever.<br /><br />The presence of actors such as Trevor Howard, Ray Milland, Richard Johnson and John Gielgud, is just a bluff, since they are just seen in very weak and very brief cameo roles throughout the movie.<br /><br />McDowell, the very talented Christopher Plummer, Simon Ward and Peter Firth, all deliver very weak performances, not due to their lack of skills, but rather due to lack of true and solid direction.<br /><br />There are too many gaps in it, and as said before, it drags itself to the dubious end. Dubious because in the original play, none of the men we come to know and sympathize with, stay alive. They are all killed in a fatal and futile mission. In the movie they all die, except Malcolm McDowell, who manages somehow to stay alive another day, being the wing commander of the unlucky bunch, just to receive another three pilots to fly and die for another lost cause.<br /><br />The end of the play leaves a bare stage in total darkness. You just hear the cannons roar, the machine guns rattle, and grenade impacts throughout the theater. Then, suddenly, total peace and silence. The curtain comes up. Lights. And here they all are. Lined up, standing straight and rigid. Obedient corpses...<br /><br />Far more interesting and far more shocking than \"Aces High\" finale, which is also dragged by the hair.<br /><br />It is up to you to judge.<br /><br />For me, if I had the money and the contacts to do so, I would take the play and develop it, the way it was meant. Adding here and there some action scene in the field, just to visualize the \"outer\" horror and slaughter going on in the \"vasty fields of France\", around the men involved, but then, just strictly concentrating on what is going on, in that tiny \"shack\" at the edge of sanity and the world...<br /><br />Want such a movie?<br /><br />Then ask for it.<br /><br />This is not it.","finished_norm":["funni","that","i","find","myself","forc","to","review","thi","movi","but","here","i","ambr","br","i","be","review","it","becaus","just","recent","i","have","have","the","chanc","to","wit","the","reviv","of","rc","sheriff","plai","journei","end","on","stage","in","new","york","at","the","belasco","theatr","star","hugh","darci","boyd","gain","jefferson","mai","and","other","a","good","a","be","masterfulli","direct","by","david","grindleybr","br","i","leav","the","theater","shatter","i","be","not","exagger","i","be","flabbergast","after","almost","two","and","a","half","hour","of","a","recreat","and","veri","claustrophob","depict","of","soldier","life","in","the","trench","of","the","somm","i","specul","dure","world","war","on","bring","to","life","vividli","by","everyon","involv","i","come","out","of","the","theater","with","the","shakesbr","br","mind","you","i","be","not","easili","shock","nor","be","i","too","sensit","i","be","a","stage","actor","and","a","director","myself","so","i","know","the","button","be","press","to","achiev","certain","effect","both","emotion","a","good","a","psychologicallybr","br","but","what","i","have","just","wit","come","so","much","to","life","that","i","have","chill","in","my","spine","a","i","leftbr","br","none","of","thi","emot","come","to","life","while","watch","ac","high","the","movi","base","on","thi","plai","and","even","adapt","for","the","screen","in","cooper","with","rc","sheriff","himself","shortli","befor","he","diedbr","br","the","screen","adapt","take","place","in","the","sky","over","franc","so","go","be","the","claustrophob","ambianc","to","start","withbr","br","the","onli","plu","of","the","movi","be","the","aerial","battl","scene","which","look","date","in","their","special","effect","compar","to","todai","standard","but","still","veri","valid","in","the","fly","tactic","adopt","on","screenbr","br","grant","there","have","be","a","coupl","of","screen","adapt","of","all","quiet","on","the","western","front","by","erich","mare","remarqu","which","take","place","in","trench","and","not","in","the","sky","but","that","be","the","german","vision","on","thing","if","on","would","like","to","be","picki","on","such","thingsbr","br","journei","end","be","just","the","other","side","of","the","medal","and","would","have","make","it","into","a","great","movi","if","thei","have","leav","it","alon","and","intactbr","br","the","transfer","on","dvd","be","poor","even","though","in","widescreen","and","adapt","for","tv","screen","the","qualiti","of","the","film","itself","be","that","of","a","movi","theater","noth","much","noth","littl","it","sport","variou","defect","such","a","minor","scratch","and","dot","although","the","copi","for","the","rest","be","cleanbr","br","if","you","want","anoth","wwi","movi","in","your","collect","especi","for","that","who","love","and","enjoi","to","see","aerial","battl","among","oldtim","then","thi","be","a","pictur","for","you","but","i","rather","would","suggest","von","richthofen","and","brown","a","a","altern","although","that","too","be","a","movi","fill","with","inaccuraciesbr","br","for","the","rest","of","you","who","love","good","act","and","drama","i","would","leav","thi","on","out","bui","the","plai","go","watch","the","plai","if","you","have","the","chanc","to","get","a","decent","reviv","of","it","near","you","but","keep","off","thi","wouldb","adaptationbr","br","it","be","a","antiwar","movi","grant","but","the","weak","i","have","ever","see","in","my","lifetim","everbr","br","the","presenc","of","actor","such","a","trevor","howard","rai","milland","richard","johnson","and","john","gielgud","be","just","a","bluff","sinc","thei","be","just","see","in","veri","weak","and","veri","brief","cameo","role","throughout","the","moviebr","br","mcdowel","the","veri","talent","christoph","plummer","simon","ward","and","peter","firth","all","deliv","veri","weak","perform","not","due","to","their","lack","of","skill","but","rather","due","to","lack","of","true","and","solid","directionbr","br","there","be","too","mani","gap","in","it","and","a","sai","befor","it","drag","itself","to","the","dubiou","end","dubiou","becaus","in","the","origin","plai","none","of","the","man","we","come","to","know","and","sympath","with","stai","aliv","thei","be","all","kill","in","a","fatal","and","futil","mission","in","the","movi","thei","all","die","except","malcolm","mcdowel","who","manag","somehow","to","stai","aliv","anoth","dai","be","the","wing","command","of","the","unlucki","bunch","just","to","receiv","anoth","three","pilot","to","fly","and","die","for","anoth","lose","causebr","br","the","end","of","the","plai","leav","a","bare","stage","in","total","dark","you","just","hear","the","cannon","roar","the","machin","gun","rattl","and","grenad","impact","throughout","the","theater","then","suddenli","total","peac","and","silenc","the","curtain","come","up","light","and","here","thei","all","be","line","up","stand","straight","an

{"value":"Sexo Cannibal, or Devil Hunter as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences, starts with actress & model Laura Crawford (Ursula Buchfellner as Ursula Fellner) checking out locations for her new film along with her assistant Jane (Gisela Hahn). After a long days work Laura is relaxing in the bath of her room when two very dubious character's named Chris (Werner Pochath) & Thomas (Antonio Mayans) burst in & kidnap her having been helped by the treacherous Jane. Laura's agent gets on the blower to rent-a-hero Peter Weston (Al Cliver) who is informed of the situation, the kidnappers have Laura on an isolated island & are demanding a 6 million ransom. Peter is told that he will be paid 200,000 to get her back safely & a further 10% of the 6 million if he brings that back as well, faster than a rat up a drain pipe Peter & his Vietnam Vet buddy helicopter pilot Jack are on the island & deciding on how to save Laura. So, the kidnappers have Laura & Peter has the 6 million but neither want to hand them over that much. Just to complicate things further this particular isolated island is home to a primitive tribe (hell, in all the generations they've lived there they've only managed to build one straw hut, now that's primitive) who worship some cannibal monster dude (Burt Altman) with bulging eyes as a God with human sacrifices & this cannibal has a liking for young, white female flesh & intestines...<br /><br />This Spanish, French & German co-production was co-written & directed by the prolific Jesus Franco who also gets the credit for the music as well. Sexo Cannibal has gained a certain amount of notoriety here in the UK as it was placed on the 'Video Nasties' list in the early 80's under it's alternate Devil Hunter title & therefore officially classed as obscene & banned, having said that I have no idea why as it is one bad film & even Franco, who isn't afraid to be associated with a turkey, decides he wants to hide under the pseudonym of Clifford Brown. I'd imagine even the most die-hard Franco fan would have a hard time defending this thing. The script by Franco, erm sorry I mean Clifford Brown & Julian Esteban as Julius Valery who was obviously another one less than impressed with the finished product & wanted his named removed, is awful. It's as simple & straight forward as that. For a start the film is so boring it's untrue, the kidnap plot is one of the dullest I've ever seen without the slightest bit of tension or excitement involved & the horror side of things don't improve as we get a big black guy with stupid looking over-sized bloodshot eyes plus two tame cannibal scenes. As a horror film Sexo Cannibal fails & as an action adventure it has no more success, this is one to avoid.<br /><br />Director Franco shows his usual incompetence throughout, a decapitated head is achieved by an actor lying on the ground with large leaves placed around the bottom of his neck to try & give the impression it's not attached to anything! The cannibal scenes are poor, the action is lame & it has endless scenes of people randomly walking around the jungle getting from 'A' to 'B' & not really doing anything when they get there either. It becomes incredibly dull & tedious to watch after about 10 minutes & don't forget this thing goes on for 94 minutes in it's uncut state. I also must mention the hilarious scene when Al Cliver is supposed to be climbing a cliff, this is achieved by Franco turning his camera on it's side & having Cliver crawl along the floor! Just look at the way his coat hangs & the way he never grabs onto to anything as he just pulls himself along! The gore isn't that great & as far as Euro cannibal films go this is very tame, there are some gross close ups of the cannibals mouth as it chews bits of meat, a man is impaled on spikes, there's some blood & a handful of intestines. There's a fair bit of nudity in Sexo Cannibal & an unpleasant rape scene.<br /><br />Sexo Cannibal must have had a low budget & I mean low. This is a shoddy poorly made film with awful special effects & rock bottom production values. The only decent thing about it is the jungle setting which at least looks authentic. The music sucks & sound effects become annoying as there is lots of heavy breathing whenever the cannibal is on screen. The acting sucks, the whole thing was obviously dubbed anyway but no one in this thing can act.<br /><br />Sexo Cannibal is a terrible film that commits the fatal mistake of being as boring as hell. The only good things I can say is that it has a certain sleazy atmosphere to it & those close ups of the cannibal chewing meat are pretty gross. Anyone looking for a decent cinematic experience should give Sexo Cannibal as wide a berth as possible, one to avoid.","finished_norm":["sexo","cannib","or","devil","hunter","a","it","much","commonli","know","amongst","english","speak","audienc","start","with","actress","model","laura","crawford","ursula","buchfelln","a","ursula","fellner","check","out","locat","for","her","new","film","along","with","her","assist","jane","gisela","hahn","after","a","long","dai","work","laura","be","relax","in","the","bath","of","her","room","when","two","veri","dubiou","charact","name","chri","werner","pochath","thoma","antonio","mayan","burst","in","kidnap","her","have","be","help","by","the","treacher","jane","laura","agent","get","on","the","blower","to","rentahero","peter","weston","al","cliver","who","be","inform","of","the","situat","the","kidnapp","have","laura","on","a","isol","island","be","demand","a","million","ransom","peter","be","tell","that","he","will","be","pai","to","get","her","back","safe","a","far","of","the","million","if","he","bring","that","back","a","good","fast","than","a","rat","up","a","drain","pipe","peter","hi","vietnam","vet","buddi","helicopt","pilot","jack","be","on","the","island","decid","on","how","to","save","laura","so","the","kidnapp","have","laura","peter","have","the","million","but","neither","want","to","hand","them","over","that","much","just","to","complic","thing","far","thi","particular","isol","island","be","home","to","a","primit","tribe","hell","in","all","the","gener","thei","have","live","there","thei","have","onli","manag","to","build","on","straw","hut","now","that","primit","who","worship","some","cannib","monster","dude","burt","altman","with","bulg","ey","a","a","god","with","human","sacrific","thi","cannib","have","a","like","for","young","white","femal","flesh","intestinesbr","br","thi","spanish","french","german","coproduct","be","cowritten","direct","by","the","prolif","jesu","franco","who","conjur","get","the","credit","for","the","music","a","good","sexo","cannib","have","gain","a","certain","amount","of","notorieti","here","in","the","uk","a","it","be","place","on","the","video","nasti","list","in","the","earli","under","it","altern","devil","hunter","titl","therefor","offici","class","a","obscen","ban","have","sai","that","i","have","no","idea","why","a","it","be","on","bad","film","even","franco","who","be","not","afraid","to","be","associ","with","a","turkei","decid","he","want","to","hide","under","the","pseudonym","of","clifford","brown","i","have","imagin","even","the","much","diehard","franco","fan","would","have","a","hard","time","defend","thi","thing","the","script","by","franco","erm","sorri","i","mean","clifford","brown","julian","esteban","a","juliu","valeri","who","be","obvious","anoth","on","littl","than","impress","with","the","finish","product","want","hi","name","remov","be","aw","it","a","simpl","straight","forward","a","that","for","a","start","the","film","be","so","bore","it","untru","the","kidnap","plot","be","on","of","the","dull","i","have","ever","see","without","the","slight","bite","of","tension","or","excit","involv","the","horror","side","of","thing","do","not","improv","a","we","get","a","big","black","gui","with","stupid","look","overs","bloodshot","ey","plu","two","tame","cannib","scene","a","a","horror","film","sexo","cannib","fail","a","a","action","adventur","it","have","no","much","success","thi","be","on","to","avoidbr","br","director","franco","show","hi","usual","incompet","throughout","a","decapit","head","be","achiev","by","a","actor","lie","on","the","grind","with","larg","leav","place","around","the","bottom","of","hi","neck","to","try","give","the","impress","it","not","attach","to","anyth","the","cannib","scene","be","poor","the","action","be","lame","it","have","endless","scene","of","peopl","randomli","walk","around","the","jungl","get","from","a","to","b","not","realli","do","anyth","when","thei","get","there","either","it","becom","incredibli","dull","tediou","to","watch","after","about","minut","do","not","forget","thi","thing","go","on","for","minut","in","it","uncut","state","i","conjur","must","mention","the","hilari","scene","when","al","cliver","be","suppos","to","be","climb","a","cliff","thi","be","achiev","by","franco","turn","hi","camera","on","it","side","have","cliver","crawl","along","the","floor","just","look","at","the","wai","hi","coat","hang","the","wai","he","never","grab","onto","to","anyth","a","he","just","pull","himself","along","the","gore","be","not","that","great","a","far","a","euro","cannib","film","go","thi","be","veri","tame","there","be","some","gross","close","up","of","the","cannib","mouth","a","it","chew","bit","of","meat","a","man","be","impal","on","spike","there","some","blood","a","hand","of","intestin","there","a","fair","bite","of","nuditi","in","sexo","cannib","a","unpleas","rape","scenebr","br","sexo","cannib","must","have","have","a","low","budget","i","mean","low","thi","be","a","shoddi","poorli","make","film","with","aw","special","effect","rock","bottom","product","valu","the

{"value":"I watched Grendel the other night and am compelled to put together a Public Service Announcement.<br /><br />Grendel is another version of Beowulf, the thousand-year-old Anglo-Saxon epic poem. The SciFi channel has a growing catalog of inoffensive and uninteresting movies, and the previews promised an inauthentic low-budget mini-epic, but this one refused to let me switch channels. It was staggeringly, overwhelmingly, bad. I watched in fascination and horror at the train wreck you couldn't tear your eyes away from. I reached for a notepad and managed to capture part of what I was seeing. The following may contain spoilers or might just save your sanity. You've been warned.<br /><br />- Just to get it over with, Beowulf's warriors wore horned helmets. Trivial issue compared to what came after. It also appears that the helmets were in a bin and handed to whichever actor wandered by next. Fit, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant.<br /><br />- Marina Sirtis had obviously been blackmailed into doing the movie by the Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey circus. She managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeup.<br /><br />- Ben Cross pretended not to be embarrassed as the king. His character, Hrothgar, must have become king of the Danes only minutes before the film opened and hadn't had a chance to get the crown resized to fit him yet.<br /><br />- To facilitate the actors' return to their day jobs waiting tables, none were required to change their hairstyles at all. The variety of hair included cornrows, sideburns, buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to distract from the dialog. To prove it was a multi-national cast, all were encouraged to retain whatever accent they chose.<br /><br />- As is typical with this type of movie (at least since Mad Max), leather armor was a requirement. In this case it was odd-shaped, ill-fitting and brand-new.<br /><br />- The female love interest, Ingrid, played by Alexis Peters, followed a long-standing tradition of hotties who should be watched with the volume turned completely down.<br /><br />- The unintended focus of the movie was a repeating, compound crossbow with exploding bolts. It never needed to be loaded and even had a recoil when fired. It managed to shred the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, historical fact and plot suspense all by itself.<br /><br />- Hrothgar's palace, Heorot, rather than being a Norse long hall, apparently was designed and constructed by artisans who sank with Atlantis.<br /><br />- Beowulf arrived at the Danes' homeland in a two-masted stern-castled ship that originally was part of a set, the other two being the Santa Maria and the Pinta.<br /><br />- Prince Unferth observed Beowulf's ship's approach using a telescope. Before you could recover from that astounding innovation, you got to see the ship from his point of view. Judging from the angle, the prince was in an aircraft of some sort.<br /><br />- Fun fact 1: In Bulgaria, fire (as from a fireplace) creates light without heat. This explains why you could see the actors' breath whether indoors or out.<br /><br />- Fun fact 2: Dark Age dancing in Denmark looks like slow dances I went to in the 8th grade.<br /><br />- Fun fact 3: You, too, can make a catapult with a timed-release air-burst explosive. But, don't expect it to actually harm anything. Incidentally, Beowulf was apparently a veteran of World War II, yelling \"Incoming!\" to shred any remaining suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />- Grendel was so upset and always in a snit because as a completely CGI creation he couldn't leave footprints. Even in snow.<br /><br />- Grendel's mom (\"Hag\") was in a foul mood because she was a single mother and junior hadn't inherited her wings. Recessive gene, I suppose. By the way, we can now make an educated guess that Grendel's pop was probably Swamp Thing.<br /><br />- Grendel and mom chose to randomly kill, fly away with or drag away their prey based only on a close reading of the next few pages of the script.<br /><br />- Fun medical fact: Being slammed by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown fifty feet against stone causes slight facial scratches that don't bleed much.<br /><br />- The sword of legend Beowulf used to dispatch the Hag was as long as he was tall and would have contained enough steel to put a second deck on the Golden Gate Bridge. Luckily the wobbling dispelled any concerns over its weight.<br /><br />- Best line of the movie: Prince Unferth had just been impaled by Hag and spit a quart of blood roughly six feet.

{"value":"\"Look, I know this may suck right now, but pain is temporary, film is forever. Whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come.\"  Robert De Niro<br /><br />This was initially a film for Steven Spielberg, the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes. And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison Robert De Niro. Like \"Jurassic Park\", \"Poltergeist\" and \"War of the Worlds\", the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast, the beast being the creation of the father, a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during his trial. <br /><br />In typical Spielberg fashion, the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins. Like Oscar Schindler, Robin Williams, Sam Niel, Tom Cruise and virtually every \"daddy\" figure in Spielberg land, the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg so enjoys.<br /><br />But Spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to Martin Scorsese, who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare. The result is arguably the worst film in Scorsese's filmography, and, ironically, his most illuminating.<br /><br />An artist's failures or misfires are often very revealing, exposing the inner workings of their art. When the story doesn't work, the characters don't connect or the images don't sear, we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core. This  the remaining carcass- is what the director's cinema is about.<br /><br />Now \"Cape Fear\" is an impersonal film, so we won't find any thematic connections to the rest of Scorsese's filmography (\"You already sacrificed me!\" De Niro yells, but the films themes of Catholic redemption are cookie cutter). What the film does, though, is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on. Watch how Scorsese's camera desperately whips back and forth, how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention. But more importantly, watch how the film makes no spatial sense. A showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound-stage, a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family's house doesn't seem to exist anywhere in particular. There is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture, Scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment. <br /><br />The reason for this is that Scorsese's camera always has to be bound, or intimately tethered, to his central character. For the world around the character to make sense, his camera has to be focused on the character. Resnais can take you around a French Hotel, Welles and Hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building, Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic, Scott can recreate an entire future cityscape, Lucas can give you an alien desert planet, and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook \"close up-mid shot-wide shot\" combinations, but Scorsese can't do this. There's no poetry, no sense of tangible space in his films. He's all about the character. You break that tether, you leave that boxing ring, that taxi cab, you look away from De Niro, and everything collapses. He simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting, which, in a way, is a prerequisite for action film-making.<br /><br />Scorsese tried to rectify this problem with \"Gangs of New York\", where the space and the sets become the central character, but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis, the actor drawing Scorsese's camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb.<br /><br />5/10  Even as a generic B-movie, this is an ugly, vulgar looking film. Look at the matte paintings, the inept attempts at tension, the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown. Still, we have Robert De Niro to pick up the slack. De Niro, who gives his body over to Scorsese like a tattooed Christ, gives the film its only great scene. In an improvised romantic sequence with young a Juliette Lewis, he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her. A kind of symbolic rape, the girl runs away, both aroused and repelled by this man's interest.<br /><br />But De Niro's performance, so deliciously over the top, simply can't be imitated by Scorsese. You'd need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like De Palma to make this work. But Scorsese? Nope.<br /><br />Worth one

{"value":"Though I'd heard that \"Cama de Gato\" was the worst Brazilian movie of the decade, I watched it giving it a chance; after all, first-time director/producer/writer Alexandre Stockler managed to make his debut feature (shot in video) for just US$ 4,000 and -- though it looks even cheaper -- I can't begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it (then as I watched it I realized why). But whatever chances you're ready to give to \"Cama de Gato\", they shrink to zero within 10 minutes: it's an unbelievably preposterous, verbose, ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray Brazilian upper-middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo-Nazis hooked on bad sex, drugs and violence (and they're made to look like closeted gays too), made with no visible trace of talent, imagination, expertise or notion of structure. Visually and aurally, it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on YouTube -- only here it lasts NINETY TWO (count'em) minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness, and it's not even funny-bad.<br /><br />We've all seen the story before: bored young guys want to have fun, go partying, take drugs and everything goes wrong -- there's gang-rape, spanking, murder, the accidental death (falling down the staircase!!) of the mother of one of the boys, culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill. Moral and literal garbage, get it? The film is heavily influenced by Larry Clark (especially \"Kids\" and \"Bully\"), but Clark's films -- though also moralist and sexploitative -- are high-class masterworks compared to this crap.<br /><br />I don't think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience's throat: Stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non-stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion -- you DO get numb-minded with so much babbling, yelling, inept direction, shaky camera and terrible acting going on. Stockler doesn't care a bit about technique (the quality of the images, framing, sound recording, soundtrack songs, dialog, sets, editing, etc is uniformly appalling), but he's a narcissistic control-freak: he anticipates the criticisms he's bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie/cutie comments, and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far-fetched and phony it all is (I could relate to THAT). <br /><br />Despite his megalomaniac ambitions, Stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure -- he can't even decide if he wants gritty realism (hand-held video camera etc) or stylization (repetition of scenes, use of alternate takes, etc). Damn, he can't even decide WHERE to put his camera (there's use of subjective camera for the THREE leads)! The dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever; the plot exists simply to justify the director's profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for. All you see is a filmmaker being hateful, preachy, condemning, moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent (or technique) to go with it.<br /><br />It's very disappointing to find Caio Blat in this mess. Certainly one of the most promising young film actors in Brazil, with his sleepy-eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall Sal Mineo's, Blat can be highly effective under good direction (as in \"Carandiru\", \"Lavoura Arcaica\", \"Proibido Proibir\"). Here, he's told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under-equipped \"actors\" in recent memory. He also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes (so goddawful they look rather like web-cam porn).<br /><br />The film opens and ends with real interviews with \"typical\" (?) middle-class youth -- Stockler wants us to take those interviews as \"proof\" of what he's trying to preach in fiction. But he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees, selecting a highlight of abject, racist, sexist, stupid statements (which only shows assholes exist everywhere). Stockler wants to prove that Brazilian middle-class youths are ALL present or future fascists BECAUSE they're middle-class and enjoy recreational drugs (is he saying all neo-fascists are on drugs?? Or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior?? I couldn't tell). <br /><br />With its dogmatic self-righteousness, headache-inducing technique and mind-bending boredom, \"Cama de Gato\" is bad for a 1,000 reasons but, above all, it's harmful in a very insidious manner: it gives detractors of Brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument. \"Cama de Gato\" is best unwatched, unmentioned, buried and

{"value":"Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II starts at the Hamilton High School prom of 1957 where Mary Lou Maloney (Lisa Schrage) is cheating on her date Bill Nordham (Steve Atkinson) with Bud Cooper (Robert Lewis). Bill finds out & is devastated, meanwhile Mary Lou is announced prom queen 1957 & takes to the stage to accept her award. Bill, still hurting, decides to play a practical joke on Mary Lou so he throws a firecracker on stage but the still lit fuse catches Mary Lou's dress setting it & her on fire, within seconds Mary Lou is toast. 30 years later & Hamilton High is soon to hold it's annual prom night. Bill (Micheal Ironside) is now the principal & has a teenage son named Craig (Justin Louis) who is dating Vicki Carpenter (Wendy Lyon) & are both planning on going to the prom together. Bud (Richard Monette) is now a priest, that terrible night 30 years ago still haunt both Bill & Bud. One day Vicki is looking around the schools basement when she discovers a large trunk which she opens, this turns out to be a bad move as the vengeful spirit of Mary Lou is set free & is intent on claiming her crown as prom queen & in her spare time sets out to avenge her untimely death. First up is Jess Browning (Beth Gondek) whose death is put down to a suicide, Mary Lou begins to posses Vicki's body as the night of the prom draws nearer. After disposing of some competition in the shape of Kelly Hennenlotter (Terri Hawkes) who tries to fix the prom so she wins. Mary Lou in Vicki's body is crowned Hamilton High prom queen which allows Mary Lou herself to come back from the dead to make an unexpected appearance & really liven the party up...<br /><br />With absolutely no connection to the original Prom Night (1980) & directed by Bruce Pittman I thought Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II wasn't a particularly good film. The script by Ron Oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes, whether this was a good or bad decision will depend on your expectations I suppose. Personally I found these different elements didn't really gel or work that well together at all. The whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable, after the opening sequence where Mary Lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark & then the film plods along for another half an hour until Vicki is finally possessed & the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil Mary Lou kills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated, come on horror film fans you did expect that clichéd 'killer not dead & ready for a sequel' ending didn't you? Don't expect a hight body count, just five throughout the entire film & none particularly graphic although I did like the way Monica (Beverley Hendry as Beverly Hendry) tried to hide in a shower room locker which Mary Lou crushed & resulting in poor Monica's blood oozing out. The supernatural side of Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is depicted by Vicki having lots of hallucinations for the first hour & Mary Lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a rocking horse which comes to life, the blackboard scene is quite good as well as it turns into water & zombie hands drag Vicki into it. The slasher side of Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II isn't outstanding, I did like Mary Lou herself as she churns out the obligatory one-liners & she made for a good villain even if she didn't get to kill enough people. Oh, & yes I did get the running homages to various other horror film director's with almost all of the character's sharing last names with one, this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch I suppose. The acting is OK but the normally dependable Micheal Ironside looks lost & uninterested almost as if he's asking himself what he's doing in this & if he'll ever work again. Forget about any gore, someone is hanged, there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen, someone is impaled with a neon light, a computer goes crazy & electrocutes someones face(!?) & Mary Lou bursts out of Vicki's body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene. There are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well, if that's your thing. To give it some credit Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II is OK to watch, has reasonable production values throughout & is generally well made. Overall I was disappointed by Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II, it was just too slow & ultimately uneventful to maintain my interest for nearly 100 minutes. I'm not sure whether it deserves a 3 or 4 star rating, I'll give it a 4 as there's nothing specifically wrong with it I suppose & I've sat through much worse films but it just didn't really do anything for me I'm

{"value":"*** Contains Spoilers ***<br /><br />I did not like this movie at all.<br /><br />I found it amazingly boring and rather superficially made, irrespective of the importance and depth of the proposed themes: given that eventually we have to die, how should we approach life? In a \"light\" way, like Tomas; in a \"heavy\" way like Tereza; or should we find ways not to face that question, like Sabina? How much is fidelity important in a relationship? How much of the professional life can be mutilated for the sake of our loved ones? How much do we have to be involved in the political life and the social issues of our Country?<br /><br />Unfortunately, I haven't read Kundera's novel but after having being let down by the movie I certainly will: I want to understand if the story was ruined by the movie adaptation (which is my guess) or if it was dull from the beginning.<br /><br />I disagree with most of the positive comments that defined the movie as a masterpiece. I simply don't see the reasons why. What I see are many flaws, and a sample of them follows.<br /><br />1) The three main characters are thrown at you and it's very hard to understand what drives them when making their choices.<br /><br />2) The \"secondary\" characters are there just to fill the gaps but they don't add nothing to the story and you wonder if they are really necessary.<br /><br />3) I did not like how Tomas was impersonated. Nothing is good for him. He is so self-centered and selfish. He is not human, in some sense. But when his self-confidence fails and he realizes that he depends on others and is emotionally linked to someone, I did not find the interpretation credible.<br /><br />4) It's very unlikely that an artist like Sabina could afford her lifestyle in a communist country in 1968. On top of that, the three main characters are all very successful in their respective professions, which sounds strange to me. a) how can Tereza become effortlessly such a good photographer? b) how can they do so well in a country lacking all the economic incentives that usually motivate people to succeed?<br /><br />5) The fake accents of the English spoken by the actors are laughable. And I am not even mother tongue. Moreover, the letter that Sabina receives while in the US is written in Czech, which I found very inconsistent.<br /><br />6) Many comments praised the movie saying that Prague was beautifully rendered: I guess that most of the movie was shot on location, so it's not difficult to give the movie a Eastern European feeling, and given the intrinsic beauty of Prague is not even difficult to make it look good.<br /><br />7) I found the ending sort of trivial. Tereza and Tomas, finally happy in the countryside, far away from the temptations of the \"metropoly\", distant from the social struggles their fellow citizens are living, detached from their professional lives, die in a car accident. But they die after having realized that they are happy, indeed. So what? Had they died unhappy, would the message of the movie have been different? I don't think so. I considered it sort of a cheap trick to please the audience.<br /><br />8) The only thing in the movie which is unbearably light is the way the director has portrayed the characters. You see them for almost three hours, but in the end you are left with nothing. You don't feel empathy, you don't relate to them, you are left there in your couch watching a sequence of events and scenes that have very little to say.<br /><br />9) I hated the \"stop the music in the restaurant\" scene (which some comments praised a lot). Why Sabina has got such a strong reaction? Why Franz agrees with her? I really don't see the point. The only thing you learn is that Sabina has got a very bad temper and quite a strong personality. That's it. What's so special and unique about it?<br /><br />After all these negative comments, let me point tout that there are two scenes that I liked a lot (that's why I gave it a two).<br /><br />The \"Naked women Photoshoot\", where the envy, the jealousy, and the insecurities of Sabina and Tereza are beautifully presented.<br /><br />The other scene is the one representing the investigations after the occupation of Prague by the Russians. Tereza pictures, taken to let the world know about what is going on in Prague, are used to identify the people taking part to the riots. I found it quite original and Tereza's sense of despair and guilt are nicely portrayed.<br /><br />Finally, there is a tiny possibility that the movie was intentionally \"designed\" in such a way that \"Tomas types\" are going to like it and \"Tereza ones\" are going to hate it. If this is the case (I strongly doubt it, though) then my comment should be revised

{"value":"I couldn't believe that this movie dates from 2007, it had all the looks of a below-average seventies horror-flick. Didn't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or CGI?!? Didn't they know that in the post-millennium the violence in a supposed horror- and/or scifi-movie should at least be a little bit graphic? Or did I get the purpose wrong, was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal, bound together in the big cycle of life, or a warning to mankind not to mess with Nature, or something like that?? It doesn't really matter, either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts.<br /><br />First of all: the premise is very improbable. If at a given time you're capable of replacing a total eye, no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time, that's totally unprofessional. And to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient?! And why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans, and make the victim look like a freak?! By the way, I noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy-like normal dark eyes, couldn't they have waited for such a specimen? The story is lame, it's about this poor guy Aaron who gets these weird eye-transplants, which suddenly makes him feel like the donor-wolf (or at least, that's what I make of it) and then he's being chased by some military men. Especially this last bit is ridiculous. I mean, I can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment (imagine soldiers with night-vision eye-sight!) but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient, it's beyond me why they're out to kill him. Why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient? (a volunteering soldier maybe??). And why try to kill everyone else that's involved with poor Aaron, isn't that a bit steep?! Who the hell are these militaries anyway, I hope not the US army or the government, they behave like psychopaths, walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons, raiding private apartments like they're after some public enemy # 1, and displaying during the ultimate show-down in the woods a total lack of discipline, like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren, panicking and shooting randomly around.<br /><br />Aaron, for some unfathomable medical reason, feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes. Why would that be??? He suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves. What is this? Are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor-wolf are situated in it's eye-balls?!? And that the recipient of these eye-balls also adopts the wolf's craving for red (life-) meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all-fours like a cat (can a wolf even DO that??!).<br /><br />The acting (or the lack thereof) didn't help the credibility of all this either: everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls, especially this Indian girl, she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression (vexed) and some disinterested mumblings about the force of Nature, and it beats me why Aaron all of a sudden is all over her (but hey, there probably had to be at least one love-scene!). I really sympathized with actor Cory Monteith, who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face, but they didn't give him much to go with. He has to run around bare-chested for more than half of the movie, which could have been fun to watch, but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique, Monteith really should leave his shirt on. His (few) killings and attacks are hardly shown, we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there's another victim lying down and Aaron with some more blood on his face and chest. Not much for a modern sci-fi horror! The only good acting came from Justine Bateman, and I really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty-something lady. She did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions, but they made her character a kind of a wimp, who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries. What a pity that the script didn't make her stand up a bit more! <br /><br />In the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie, hardly scary or thrilling, with unbelievable goings-on, a lot of overlong National Geographic-like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes (who cares?!?), some pretentious Indian ramblings about Man and Nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments. I guess the word \"superfluous\" covers it

{"value":"Made one year before ILSA, SHE-WOLF OF THE SS, BLACKSNAKE could have easily been called SUSAN, SHE-WOLF OF THE PLANTATION and it probably inspired the producers behind the Nazi sexploitation epics to go ahead with their more infamous films because the stories are identical: a gorgeous, horny, head strong (but stupid) blonde woman degrades and kills many people under her control, whom all hate her and want her dead. Sounds familiar? Director Russ Meyer and David Friedman, the producer behind the ILSA flicks, are good friends and they started their careers together. So, obviously, there's a connection there. Looking at BLACKSNAKE, I can't help but think that Russ Meyer wanted to move on and do something else than his typical busty women epics because XXX movies were all the rage during the mid 1970s, and Russ Meyer films, though filled with nudity and kinkiness and violence, were never even close to real porn. His films started to look positively quaint next to DEEP THROAT and other hard-core porno blockbusters. Meyer knew he couldn't compete with such films and BLACKSNAKE is sorta the end result of such a quandary in his career. He obviously wanted to branch out into different uncharted territory. But BLACKSNAKE bombed at the B.O. and Meyer quickly returned to making VIXEN type of films that, even if they still weren't pornographic, they were most definitely more over-the-top than any of his previous films.<br /><br />It's no wonder BLACKSNAKE was a B.O. failure. It's just terrible. Trash-o-rama. Jaw-droppingly bad. It's a quasi-campy take on slavery, if you can imagine that. The end result is jarring. One minute, we're in typical Meyer territory: exuberant, playful and silly, and then the next minute, super serious meditation on slavery and violence. Huh? It just doesn't work. The slavery/racism aspect is woefully mishandled and veers this movie in the true exploitation category. But BLACKSNAKE is not as sleazy as ILSA SHE WOLF OF THE SS and those kind of films, so I imagine fans of the latter were disappointed by it, which would explain the almost lack of interest in this movie from either exploitation fans or Russ Meyer fans. Meyer blames the failure of BLACKSNAKE because, and I quote, \"It didn't have enough breasts in it.\" Well, I'm sorry Russ, but the film is just bad, breast or no breasts. But he's right though about the low breast quota. Except for Anouska and the maid, the film's cast is male. Meyer replaces his usual bevy of buxom babes with throng of hunks with massive pecs, in the form of anonymous black actors playing the slaves and the big David (Darth Vader) Prowse. And with Anouska's right hand man around, who is portrayed as a ruthless but clever gay man who enjoys the power he has over the men, one can only wonder what Meyer was really trying to create here.<br /><br />BLACKSNAKE stars David Warbeck, who is lusted after by Anouska and her right hand man. Poor David. He looks totally befuddled by the whole experience. He did seem to have fun making the movie but you can clearly see that, at times, he has no idea what's going on. And then there's Anouska Hempel. She's a beautiful woman...for the 1970s, not the 1870s. With her makeup and hair, she looks like a typical 1970s Brit pin-up babe than a turn of the century dominatrix. And her wardrobe is hilarious. At one time, she actually unzips her leather boots! I didn't know they had zippers in those days. But the character she plays is, in itself, really degrading (no pun intended). She's nothing but a cipher to the object of lust and scorn of every men (and that woman) on the island. For example, one night, when David and Anouska are getting it on, her annoying slave driver walks in the room, knocks David unconscious and tries to rape her, groping her savagely. The next day, the slave driver is still working for Anouska and the two act as if nothing had happened. It's totally ludicrous. Under any circumstance, had her character been a real person, Anouska would have whipped the slave driver senseless and kicked his butt off the island. Or even killed him. But the fact that the woman keeps him on her plantation after he tried to rape her is stretching the flimsy story and characters' credulity to the max.<br /><br />Ridiculous details like this, and the thoroughly startling blaxploitation angle makes BLACKSNAKE a strangely unpleasant but watchable movie. Watchable in the train wreck variety. I just couldn't help but watch the film for the utter baseless aspects of it all (the excellent cinematography sorta makes it easier to watch). So, this being an exploitation film, I guess it succeeded in doing what it was supposed to do. But BLACKSNAKE is mainly for Russ Meyer completists.","finished_norm":["make","on","year","befor","ilsa","shewolf","of","the","blacksnak","can","have","easili","be","call","susan","shewolf","of","the","plantat","and","it","probabl","inspir","the","produc","behind","the","nazi","sexploit","epic","to","go","ahead","with","their","much","infam","film","becaus","the","stori","be","ident","a","gorgeou","horni","head","strong","but","stupid","blond","woman","degrad","and","kill","mani","peopl","under","her","control","whom","all","hate","her","and","want","her","dead","sound","familiar","director","russ","meyer","and","david","friedman","the","produc","behind","the","ilsa","flick","be","good","friend","and","thei","start","their","career","togeth","so","obvious","there","a","connect","there","look","at","blacksnak","i","ca","not","help","but","think","that","russ","meyer","want","to","move","on","and","do","someth","els","than","hi","typic","busti","woman","epic","becaus","xxx","movi","be","all","the","rage","dure","the","mid","and","russ","meyer","film","though","fill","with","nuditi","and","kinki","and","violenc","be","never","even","close","to","real","porn","hi","film","start","to","look","posit","quaint","next","to","deep","throat","and","other","hardcor","porno","blockbust","meyer","know","he","can","not","compet","with","such","film","and","blacksnak","be","sorta","the","end","result","of","such","a","quandari","in","hi","career","he","obvious","want","to","branch","out","into","differ","unchart","territori","but","blacksnak","bomb","at","the","bo","and","meyer","quickli","return","to","make","vixen","typ","of","film","that","even","if","thei","still","be","not","pornograph","thei","be","much","definit","much","overthetop","than","ani","of","hi","previou","filmsbr","br","it","no","wonder","blacksnak","be","a","bo","failur","it","just","terribl","trashorama","jawdroppingli","bad","it","a","quasicampi","take","on","slaveri","if","you","can","imagin","that","the","end","result","be","jar","on","minut","we","re","in","typic","meyer","territori","exuber","play","and","silli","and","then","the","next","minut","super","seriou","medit","on","slaveri","and","violenc","huh","it","just","doe","not","work","the","slaveryrac","aspect","be","woefulli","mishandl","and","veer","thi","movi","in","the","true","exploit","categori","but","blacksnak","be","not","a","sleazi","a","ilsa","she","wolf","of","the","and","that","kind","of","film","so","i","imagin","fan","of","the","latter","be","disappoint","by","it","which","would","explain","the","almost","lack","of","interest","in","thi","movi","from","either","exploit","fan","or","russ","meyer","fan","meyer","blame","the","failur","of","blacksnak","becaus","and","i","quot","it","do","not","have","enough","breast","in","it","good","i","be","sorri","russ","but","the","film","be","just","bad","breast","or","no","breast","but","he","right","though","about","the","low","breast","quota","except","for","anouska","and","the","maid","the","film","cast","be","male","meyer","replac","hi","usual","bevi","of","buxom","babe","with","throng","of","hunk","with","massiv","pec","in","the","form","of","anonym","black","actor","plai","the","slave","and","the","big","david","darth","vader","prows","and","with","anouska","right","hand","man","around","who","be","portrai","a","a","ruthless","but","clever","gai","man","who","enjoi","the","power","he","have","over","the","man","on","can","onli","wonder","what","meyer","be","realli","try","to","creat","herebr","br","blacksnak","star","david","warbeck","who","be","lust","after","by","anouska","and","her","right","hand","man","poor","david","he","look","total","befuddl","by","the","whole","experi","he","do","seem","to","have","fun","make","the","movi","but","you","can","clearli","see","that","at","time","he","have","no","idea","what","go","on","and","then","there","anouska","hempel","she","a","beauti","womanfor","the","not","the","with","her","makeup","and","hair","she","look","like","a","typic","brit","pinup","babe","than","a","turn","of","the","centuri","dominatrix","and","her","wardrob","be","hilari","at","on","time","she","actual","unzip","her","leather","boot","i","do","not","know","thei","have","zipper","in","that","dai","but","the","charact","she","plai","be","in","itself","realli","degrad","no","pun","intend","she","noth","but","a","cipher","to","the","object","of","lust","and","scorn","of","everi","man","and","that","woman","on","the","island","for","exampl","on","night","when","david","and","anouska","be","get","it","on","her","annoi","slave","driver","walk","in","the","room","knock","david","unconsci","and","try","to","rape","her","grope","her","savag","the","next","dai","the","slave","driver","be","still","work","for","anouska","and","the","two","act","a","if","noth","have","happen","it","total","ludicr","under","ani","circumst","have","her","charact","be","a","real","person","anouska","would","have","whip","the","slave","driver","senseless","and","kick","hi","butt","off","the","islan

{"value":"A seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating. The premise seems simple enough: Yentl, a girl interested in studying the Talmud, wants to go to school. But only boys are allowed to study, so after her father's death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in. She does and becomes close friends with Avigdor, who is to be married to a beautiful woman named Hadass. Hadass' family learns Avigdor's brother committed suicide, and the wedding is called off. Yentl, now calling herself Anschel, is then selected to marry Hadass. She does but it is never consummated. Yentl/Anschel and Avigdor go away for a few days, and Yentl/Anschel reveals her secret to him. The movie ends with Avigdor returning to (and marrying?) Hadass, and Yentl going to America to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise.<br /><br />The plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long, but there are several things that ruin it. For starters, there is the constant SINGING. (I can already hear the critics shouting.) Yes, I know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers. But the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them. The songs become tedious after a while, and there isn't as much dancing as one would expect. Many of the songs are forgettable, with no real memorable lyrics, and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice-over. Only one song stands out from the rest, \"Papa Can You Hear Me\". It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so Streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes. Chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is, so the songs really aren't necessary. <br /><br />Second, Streisand's makeup, which can be seen during her scenes as a man (the lipstick, enhanced lashes, and traces of blush are all obvious) makes it hard for the audience to believe in the Yentl/Anschel character, that she is actually serious, and fooling her new friends, colleagues, and even Hadass, into believing she is a man. Yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing. There seems to be a contradiction, as her character talks, or rather sings, of how she doesn't think she can pull it off, but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men's clothing. This means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can't see the other differences, such as her actions, which are clear giveaways. The facial differences alone cannot be included, as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends didn't have a beard or other facial hair. Nevertheless, in the 1900s, if a woman dressed as a man, but wore as much makeup as Streisand's character did, and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men's clothing, it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage. Chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town, or even the country. Therefore the \"feminine\" makeup on Streisand does not lend to the character's credibility, and only weakens the plot. If it was only applied to make Streisand look more beautiful, it should have been scrapped. <br /><br />Thirdly, when Yentl/Anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end, we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as Streisand's and only when they learn the \"truth\" do they become a little wiser. By now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom-made vehicle for Streisand to fuel.<br /><br />Lastly, there are those who are fans of Streisand who will find no fault with this film, its plot, or the songs. To those I must respectfully disagree. While she has excellent vocal and acting abilities, I am not a \"fan\" of her style of singing. However, I have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals. There are even some songs of hers that I like, so I am not a \"hater\" nor have set out to bash her. I have written this review from an honest perspective, from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie - several times even - and has noted the problems within. If Streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film, she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented, beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn. This movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities, make her appear self-absorbed, and thus turn the film into a laugh-fest unworthy of her fans or audience.","finished_norm":["a","seemingli","endless","movi","that","realli","deserv","a","zero","rate","the","premis","seem","simpl","enough","yentl","a","girl","interest","in","studi","the","talmud","want","to","go","to","school","but","onli","boi","be","allow","to","studi","so","after","her","father","death","she","decid","to","disguis","herself","a","a","boi","to","get","in","she","doe","and","becom","close","friend","with","avigdor","who","be","to","be","marri","to","a","beauti","woman","name","hadass","hadass","famili","learn","avigdor","brother","commit","suicid","and","the","wed","be","call","off","yentl","now","call","herself","anschel","be","then","select","to","marri","hadass","she","doe","but","it","be","never","consumm","yentlanschel","and","avigdor","go","awai","for","a","few","dai","and","yentlanschel","reveal","her","secret","to","him","the","movi","end","with","avigdor","return","to","and","marri","hadass","and","yentl","go","to","america","to","continu","her","studi","although","she","will","have","to","continu","to","do","so","in","disguisebr","br","the","plot","abov","seem","interest","at","for","a","movi","over","hour","long","but","there","be","sever","thing","that","ruin","it","for","starter","there","be","the","constant","sing","i","can","alreadi","hear","the","critic","shout","ye","i","know","thi","be","a","music","so","there","be","suppos","to","be","lot","of","song","and","danc","number","but","the","movi","can","have","be","improv","if","it","be","direct","and","plai","without","them","the","song","becom","tediou","after","a","while","and","there","be","not","a","much","danc","a","on","would","expect","mani","of","the","song","be","forgett","with","no","real","memor","lyric","and","that","with","ani","signific","can","easili","have","be","substitut","by","a","voiceov","onli","on","song","stand","out","from","the","rest","papa","can","you","hear","me","it","be","obviou","that","much","of","the","other","be","deliber","place","so","streisand","can","simpli","have","a","reason","to","show","off","her","vocal","abil","everi","five","to","ten","minut","chanc","be","anyon","who","will","see","thi","film","will","alreadi","know","what","a","superb","singer","and","actress","she","be","so","the","song","realli","be","not","necessari","br","br","streisand","makeup","which","can","be","see","dure","her","scene","a","a","man","the","lipstick","enhanc","lash","and","trace","of","blush","be","all","obviou","make","it","hard","for","the","audienc","to","believ","in","the","yentlanschel","charact","that","she","be","actual","seriou","and","fool","her","new","friend","colleagu","and","even","hadass","into","believ","she","be","a","man","yet","we","be","ask","and","expect","to","believ","that","veri","thing","there","seem","to","be","a","contradict","a","her","charact","talk","or","rather","sing","of","how","she","doe","not","think","she","can","pull","it","off","but","be","surpris","that","everyon","seem","to","be","fool","becaus","she","be","wear","man","cloth","thi","mean","that","we","be","then","expect","to","believ","the","other","charact","be","so","naiv","thei","ca","not","see","the","other","differ","such","a","her","action","which","be","clear","giveawai","the","facial","differ","alon","cannot","be","includ","a","other","charact","in","the","film","mention","that","some","of","their","male","rel","or","friend","do","not","have","a","beard","or","other","facial","hair","nevertheless","in","the","if","a","woman","dress","a","a","man","but","wear","a","much","makeup","a","streisand","charact","do","and","still","try","to","pass","herself","off","a","a","man","sole","becaus","she","wear","man","cloth","it","would","have","be","deem","unaccept","and","caus","a","outrag","chanc","be","she","would","probabl","be","forc","to","leav","the","town","or","even","the","countri","therefor","the","feminin","makeup","on","streisand","doe","not","lend","to","the","charact","credibl","and","onli","weaken","the","plot","if","it","be","onli","appli","to","make","streisand","look","much","beauti","it","should","have","be","scrap","br","br","thirdli","when","yentlanschel","herself","reveal","who","she","truli","be","toward","the","end","we","be","then","ask","to","believ","that","the","other","charact","be","not","a","smart","a","streisand","and","onli","when","thei","learn","the","truth","do","thei","becom","a","littl","wise","by","now","it","becom","much","and","much","appar","that","the","whole","plot","be","so","far","fetch","that","it","be","noth","much","than","a","custommad","vehicl","for","streisand","to","fuelbr","br","lastli","there","be","that","who","be","fan","of","streisand","who","will","find","no","fault","with","thi","film","it","plot","or","the","song","to","that","i","must","respectfulli","disagre","while","she","have","excel","vocal","and","act","abil","i","be","not","a","fan","of","her","styl","of","sing","howev","i","have","enjoi","mani","of","her","other","featur","includ","music","the

{"value":"Dreamgirls, despite its fistful of Tony wins in an incredibly weak year on Broadway, has never been what one would call a jewel in the crown of stage musicals. However, that is not to say that in the right cinematic hands it could not be fleshed out and polished into something worthwhile on-screen. Unfortunately, what transfers to the screen is basically a slavishly faithful version of the stage hit with all of its inherent weaknesses intact. First, the score has never been one of the strong points of this production and the film does not change that factor. There are lots of songs (perhaps too many?), but few of them are especially memorable. The closest any come to catchy tunes are the title song and One Night Only - the much acclaimed And I Am Telling You That I Am Not Going is less a great song than it is a dramatic set piece for the character of Effie (Jennifer Hudson). The film is slick and technically well-produced, but the story and characters are surprisingly thin and lacking in any resonance. There is some interest in the opening moments, watching Jamie Foxx's Svengali-like manager manipulate his acts to the top, but that takes a back seat in the latter portion of the film, when the story conveniently tries to cast him as a villain, despite his having been right from a business stand-point for a good majority of the film. Beyonce Knowles is lovely and sings her songs perfectly well, but is stuck with a character who is basically all surface glitz. Anika Noni Rose as the third member of the Dreamgirls trio literally has nothing to do for the entire film. Eddie Murphy acquits himself well as a singer obviously based on James Brown, but the role is not especially meaty and ultimately has little impact. Foxx would seem ideal casting, but he seems oddly withdrawn and bored. The film's biggest selling point is surely former American Idol contestant/Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson in the central role of Effie White, the temperamental singer who gets booted from the group and makes a triumphant closing act return. For me, Effie has always been a big problem in both the show and the movie. The film obviously wants you to feel sorry for her and rather ham-handedly takes her side, but I have never been sure that this character deserves that kind of devotion. From the start, Effie conducts herself for the most part like an obnoxious, egotistical, self-centered diva, who is more interested in what everyone else can do for her rather than having much vested interest in the group of which she is a part. When she is booted from the group for her unprofessionalism and bad attitude, the charges are more than well-founded, but the stage show/film seem to think Effie should be cut unlimited slack simply because she has a great voice. Even though the film tries to soften some of Effie's harder edges to make her more likable, the charges still stand. Her story becomes more manipulative by suggesting she should have our further sympathy because she is an unwed mother struggling to raise her daughter - using the implication that (much like the talent card) motherhood immediately makes any behavior excusable. Indeed the only big effort the film makes to show Effie's mothering is to tell us about it and then include a scene where she barks at her daughter in the unemployment office, insists that the girl has \"no father\" and then refuse to look for gainful employment to support them since singing is all she knows. In the hands of a skillful actress, the gaps could perhaps have been remedied with technique and charisma. Unfortunately, Hudson is not that actress. She sings well, but the dialog-driven moments do not come naturally to her nor do high emotional moments. Effie's signature moment (the aforementioned And I Am Telling You... number) is well-sung by Hudson, but emotionally flat in the acting department. Effie is supposed to expressing her rage and desperation at her predicament, but Hudson comes off as a cabaret performer belting out a hot number. All in all, not quite the emotional highlight one expects. The latter portion of the film is basically a predictable melange of events that maneuver Foxx into Hudson's earlier position and allow her to strut back in and lord it over everyone. Foxx's criminal offenses in the film are undoubtedly par for the course of many struggling record producers, but the film's seeming implication that he has it coming because he helped usher in the disco era is rather ridiculous, not to mention pretentious and condescending, particularly coming from a film with all of the depth of a puddle. The end result is a faithful rendition of the stage hit, drained of emotion, energy or anything that can be described as

{"value":"Facts about National Lampoon Goes to the Movies, a.k.a. National Lampoon's Movie Madness:<br /><br />1. The movie is poor, even by Lampoon's typical standards. 2. It's not funny. 3. No one goes to see a movie.<br /><br />So, after I finished watching it, I began wondering why on earth it's called 'National Lampoon Goes to the Movies,' and why it was ever conceived, much less actually made. It would be like calling Austin Powers 'An American Guy Goes to the Movies.' How lame. He isn't American, and he doesn't go to movies. None of the characters in Lampoon's so-called 'satire' are funny, and none go see movies, which causes a bit of a problem. I had hoped it would be something in the vein of Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it isn't.<br /><br />This was National Lampoon's first film after Animal House, although you couldn't tell it from the quality of film. Poorly developed, rough and amateurish by any standard, it induces headaches  not a good sign for an 89-minute movie that seems double the length.<br /><br />I've noticed a pattern. Really bad movies are typically renamed  and this little disaster falls under that category. It has two separate titles -- probably to help try and promote it to people too stupid to remember how bad a panning it received from home video critics in 1982/83. 'Hmm, Movie Madness  I've never heard of this movie before! Let's rent it!' And then, the realization: 'Hey, wait a minute, this is just National Lampoon Goes to the Movies!'<br /><br />It was shelved by MGM/UA, never to be released into theaters or DVD; it occasionally pops up on television a few times per decade, which is just about the only place you'll manage to find it.<br /><br />It's split up into three stories  a parody of self-enlargement videos, butter and corporate ruthlessness, and police brutality/cop-buddy films (I guess). The first segment stars Peter Riegert (Animal House) as a frustrated guy who divorces his wife and does some other stuff. I'm not sure what because it was so boring my mind started to drift. Until the sex scene popped up.<br /><br />Part II is about an exotic dancer raped by a stick of butter (don't ask) who decides to become Queen of the Margarine so she can cut off the supply of dairy products. Ouch! This contains the only funny line in the movie: 'Only I can make love with my son!' If you think that doesn't sound very funny, you're right  it's not. And just imagine  it's the highlight of this film!<br /><br />Part III is about a cop who chases down a serial killer (Christopher Lloyd) only to lose his nerve and shoot the guy. It does contain one funny scene but it's extremely over-acted  only Lloyd really exhibits any humor, playing his character dry and compassionate, yet strangely surreal. The part where he's choking his victim and the meek cop stands by watching it all unfold, at least, evoked a chuckle or two.<br /><br />It's a shame to watch such a cast of semi-famous names resort to low standards. The writers of each segment clearly believe that they're being very ironic and clever by spoofing so-called stereotypes  the fault being that the movie becomes one huge contradiction, favoring the standard T & A instead of plot; crude humor instead of witty dialogue; desperate performances instead of inspired ones. It's easy to see that none of the actors were enthralled with the material, muttering their lines, often so embarrassed they can seldom make eye contact with the camera.<br /><br />The movie isn't funny, as I said before. I laughed once, at only one line, and even then it was a halfhearted one. Two chuckles, a smile, and a very weak laugh. Compared to Movie Madness, a number of other decent comedies seem like regular laugh tracks.<br /><br />I like National Lampoon's Vacation series (or, at least three of four installments), and their classic Animal House, but their recent slew of direct-to-video bombs such as Golf Punks (with that great comic genius Tom Arnold) provide a good example of why their magazine went out of print more than a decade ago. It gets really old, really fast.<br /><br />Sad to see a new film, called Gold Diggers, is being released with their 'stamp of approval.' It's like condemning a film before it even hits theaters  maybe they should start not advertising their name all over the place<br /><br />Distributor: 'This movie is bad. It gets the National Lampoon stamp of approval. That'll teach you not to make something so awful next time.'<br /><br />Forget the death penalty. Just stick a bunch of criminals in a room and make them watch this over and over every day for a month.<br /><br />It's so bad that I can't even begin to explain its putrid vileness. I give up.","finished_norm":["fact","about","nation","lampoon","go","to","the","movi","aka","nation","lampoon","movi","madnessbr","br","the","movi","be","poor","even","by","lampoon","typic","standard","it","not","funni","no","on","go","to","see","a","moviebr","br","so","after","i","finish","watch","it","i","begin","wonder","why","on","earth","it","call","nation","lampoon","go","to","the","movi","and","why","it","be","ever","conceiv","much","littl","actual","make","it","would","be","like","call","austin","power","a","american","gui","go","to","the","movi","how","lame","he","be","not","american","and","he","doe","not","go","to","movi","none","of","the","charact","in","lampoon","socal","satir","be","funni","and","none","go","see","movi","which","caus","a","bite","of","a","problem","i","have","hope","it","would","be","someth","in","the","vein","of","mysteri","scienc","theater","but","it","isntbr","br","thi","be","nation","lampoon","film","after","anim","hous","although","you","can","not","tell","it","from","the","qualiti","of","film","poorli","develop","rough","and","amateurish","by","ani","standard","it","induc","headach","not","a","good","sign","for","a","minut","movi","that","seem","doubl","the","lengthbr","br","i","have","notic","a","pattern","realli","bad","movi","be","typic","renam","and","thi","littl","disast","fall","under","that","categori","it","have","two","separ","titl","probabl","to","help","try","and","promot","it","to","peopl","too","stupid","to","rememb","how","bad","a","pan","it","receiv","from","home","video","critic","in","hmm","movi","mad","i","have","never","hear","of","thi","movi","befor","let","rend","it","and","then","the","realiz","hei","wait","a","minut","thi","be","just","nation","lampoon","go","to","the","moviesbr","br","it","be","shelv","by","mgmua","never","to","be","releas","into","theater","or","dvd","it","occasion","pop","up","on","televis","a","few","time","per","decad","which","be","just","about","the","onli","place","you","will","manag","to","find","itbr","br","it","split","up","into","three","stori","a","parodi","of","selfenlarg","video","butter","and","corpor","ruthless","and","polic","brutalitycopbuddi","film","i","guess","the","segment","star","peter","riegert","anim","hous","a","a","frustrat","gui","who","divorc","hi","wife","and","doe","some","other","stuff","i","be","not","sure","what","becaus","it","be","so","bore","my","mind","start","to","drift","until","the","sex","scene","pop","upbr","br","part","ii","be","about","a","exot","dancer","rape","by","a","stick","of","butter","do","not","ask","who","decid","to","becom","queen","of","the","margarin","so","she","can","cut","off","the","suppli","of","dairi","product","ouch","thi","contain","the","onli","funni","line","in","the","movi","onli","i","can","make","love","with","my","son","if","you","think","that","doe","not","sound","veri","funni","you","re","right","it","not","and","just","imagin","it","the","highlight","of","thi","filmbr","br","part","iii","be","about","a","cop","who","chase","down","a","serial","killer","christoph","lloyd","onli","to","lose","hi","nerv","and","shoot","the","gui","it","doe","contain","on","funni","scene","but","it","extrem","overact","onli","lloyd","realli","exhibit","ani","humor","plai","hi","charact","spindri","and","compassion","yet","strang","surreal","the","part","where","he","choke","hi","victim","and","the","meek","cop","stand","by","watch","it","all","unfold","at","littl","evok","a","chuckl","or","twobr","br","it","a","shame","to","watch","such","a","cast","of","semifam","name","resort","to","low","standard","the","writer","of","each","segment","clearli","believ","that","thei","re","be","veri","iron","and","clever","by","spoof","socal","stereotyp","the","fault","be","that","the","movi","becom","on","huge","contradict","favor","the","standard","t","a","instead","of","plot","crude","humor","instead","of","witti","dialogu","desper","perform","instead","of","inspir","on","it","easi","to","see","that","none","of","the","actor","be","enthral","with","the","materi","mutter","their","line","often","so","embarrass","thei","can","seldom","make","ey","contact","with","the","camerabr","br","the","movi","be","not","funni","a","i","sai","befor","i","laugh","onc","at","onli","on","line","and","even","then","it","be","a","halfheart","on","two","chuckl","a","smile","and","a","veri","weak","laugh","compar","to","movi","mad","a","numb","of","other","decent","comedi","seem","like","regular","laugh","tracksbr","br","i","like","nation","lampoon","vacat","seri","or","at","littl","three","of","four","instal","and","their","classic","anim","hous","but","their","recent","slai","of","directtovideo","bomb","such","a","golf","punk","with","that","great","comic","geniu","tom","arnold","provid","a","good","exampl","of","why","their","magazin","go","out","of","print","much","than","a","decad","ago","it","get","realli","old","realli","fastbr","br","sad","to","see","a","new","film","call","gold","digger","be","be","releas","

{"value":"\"Nacho Libre\" (2006) <br /><br />Directed By: Jared Hess <br /><br />Starring: Jack Black, Ana de la Reguera, Héctor Jiménez, & Darius Rose <br /><br />MPAA Rating: \"PG-13\" (for some rough action, and crude humor including dialog) <br /><br />Say what you will about it (I know some people who despise it to no end), but I have always thought that \"Napoleon Dynamite\" was a funny movie--not the brightest brick on the wall, but a funny movie, nonetheless. Jack Black is also a very funny man--irritating at times, yes, and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him, but funny. There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree. So, I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess, the writer and director of \"Napoleon Dynamite\", and Jack Black would be teaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage. My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin. Unfortunately, my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie. This plot, had it been done as a skit on some such show as \"Saturday Night Live\" or possibly even \"Mad TV\", would have worked flawlessly. Unfortunately, the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one-joke comedy falls flat.<br /><br />Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord. Feeling shunned by the entire monastery, Nacho (Black), now the monastery's cook, decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler. As the monastery's finances hit an all-time low, Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery's orphanage. This plot sounds so sweet and caring. It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black. Look what he did with \"School of Rock\" after all. Well, to my displeasure, this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie. It is again Hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorof course, for all I know, maybe that is the general thought of teenagers, as many seemed to enjoy this movie. Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh, but don't expect to get an award for putting it in your movie. A seven-year-old could make up the same joke.<br /><br />The performances in \"Nacho Libre\" are actually good. Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic, worthless lines in ever put on paper comical. Unfortunately, this movie just wasn't enough for him. It didn't give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him. I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before, but now I can say that, not only is she quite talented, but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight. She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well. Héctor Jiménez, who plays Nacho's bumbling partner, Esqueleto, kept me laughing continuously. He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black's. Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, didn't have many lines, but, what can I say, I just enjoyed him. He was adorable. The rest of the cast did their job. It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub-par movie.<br /><br />\"Nacho Libre\" just does not work. Its plot is stretched far too thin. The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don't work. I very rarely laughed and, if I did, it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast. And that leads me to the bright side of \"Nacho Libre\": yes, the cast. This cast was justwell, for lack of a better word, they were on. They all clicked, had excellent chemistry together, and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script. After Jared Hess's \"Napoleon Dynamite\" kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie, I was surprised to find myself so often bored with \"Nacho Libre\". Something was lost here and I have yet to understand what it was. All I know is that \"Nacho Libre\" is not a good movie and yet, because of its cast, it is completely worthless. There is a small reason to watch, if only to watch Jack Black work. But, if you are not a fan of Jack Black, then avoid this movie like the plague. I like Black, but I am done with this movie and with this review.<br /><br />Final Thought: Yikes! This is Jared Hess's surprisingly disappointing follow-up to his hysterical \"Napoleon Dynamite\".<br /><br />Overall Rating: 4/10

{"value":"Another Priyadarshan/Vohra flick another movie that was seen for TP rather than actual desire, the only reason i did see this movie was the fact that the regulars were not there in this movie (Akshay Paresh and many others), but needless to say i had low expectations from this movie.<br /><br />I was happy with the casting in general except, Rajpal Yadav who once again annoys to no limit, he does however extract some laughs, but these were those standard slapstick non-original jokes, in fact this whole movie is like playing the dhol, I mean it takes hardly any talent to make loud noise, or even play the odd good beat on the dhol for a small time does it?? Its only those who can carry different beats in a nice sequential manner, for an extended period who are considered great.<br /><br />Which brings us to the other instrument, the Dumroo hardly requires any talent, it has no variations, and it may be enjoyable for a while the monkey dances (hmm sounds like Rajpal Yadav, good analogy), but its not a instrument that will entertain you for long or even get you dancing like the Dhol does.<br /><br />This movie was like the dhol and the dumroo being played, sometimes the Dhol was played sometimes the dumroo, sometimes both together, but mostly the Dumroo played alone and the monkey danced. And like any 24 year old sooner than later I got bored.<br /><br />The movie has some good Dhol (good) moments but after a while all i heard was the annoying Dumroo (entertaining initially, then tolerable then irritating), the large ordinary parts really ensure this movie is mainly good for a few funny clips on \"MERE BHAINS KO ANDA KYUN MARA\" (if you haven't watched it watch it on Filmy, it comes in the evenings and is really quite funny).<br /><br />This movie had its moments, the actors did a fine job, except Rajpal Yadav (who can act though, I've seen him in Main Meri Patni) who annoys more than entertains, I've said it many time and I'll say it again I really think Sharman Joshi and Tushar Kapoor have a fine career ahead of them in the multi-star comedies especially.<br /><br />Some scenes were really funny such as the aborted attempts to impress the girls father, the zany attempts to woo the girl and take her away from each other.<br /><br />But after this was over there was a failed attempt to make this movie into much more with a mystery added, this mean that once the girl was in, the following 45-60 mins was increasingly torturous, the climax was \"SO BAD ITS ALMOST GOOD CATEGORY\", I mean what were they thinking if you had to have tense ending at least make some attempt to make it palatable.<br /><br />The movie is also extremely predictable, there's hardly a scene you cant predict and you wont be breaking into spontaneous burst of laughter here, its more like you see it coming and almost start laughing before the gag.<br /><br />The movie follows a gradual decline throughout the movies except for the odd bump, down or up, and then rapidly tumbles downhill once they have made friends with the girl.<br /><br />Most of the really bad scenes were towards the end, one the movie tries to be more than a run of the mill comedy, also many of the jokes were very very stale and reeked of repetition, THE LAST 10-15 WAS ESPECIALLY DISTATEFULL AND COMPLETELY SPOILS THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />I didn't find Tanushree Datta quite the siren she was to play, and her acting talent is in serious question, especially in view of her non-appealing looks, if you cant be a HOT and cant act how much time can you survive.<br /><br />Technically also this movie was weak, with the constant female gaze and shoddy lighting and camera-work.<br /><br />The songs except the title track were no good either, when the songs played in the 2nd half I could feel the collective gasp from the audience.<br /><br />In all a movie that's just ordinary merely because of the cast, and the very low expectations.<br /><br />Avoiding it wont be a bad idea.<br /><br />And if it has to be watched watching it on TV for free or a very cheap matinée or something is a must, if you pay full multiplex rates you will feel disappointed.<br /><br />-s lots of stale jokes, RAJPAL YADAV, LAST 45 MINS AND LAST 15 MINS ESPECIALLY, bad technically, bad songs.<br /><br />+/-s tries to be more than what it was, not the regular cast (I'm happier for it), Tanushree Datta.<br /><br />+s some good scenes towards the beginning,title song, good acting and cast except RY.<br /><br />total 4.5/10 (I'm trying to be objective here, i don't like Rajpal Yadav or Tanushree Datta and this movie did meet my very low expectations, so I'm giving it the benefit of all doubts, on absolute terms

{"value":"WARNING: This review contains SPOILERS. Do not read if you don't want some points revealed to you before you watch the film.<br /><br />With a cast like this, you wonder whether or not the actors and actresses knew exactly what they were getting into. Did they see the script and say, `Hey, Close Encounters of the Third Kind was such a hit that this one can't fail.' Unfortunately, it does. Did they even think to check on the director's credentials? I mean, would YOU do a movie with the director of a movie called `Satan's Cheerleaders?' Greydon Clark, who would later go on to direct the infamous `Final Justice,' made this. It makes you wonder how the people of Mystery Science Theater 3000 could hammer `Final Justice' and completely miss out on `The Return.'<br /><br />The film is set in a small town in New Mexico. A little boy and girl are in the street unsupervised one night when a powerful flashlight beam.er.a spaceship appears and hovers over them. In probably the worst special effect sequence of the film, the ship spews some kind of red ink on them. It looked like Clark had held a beaker of water in from of the camera lens and dipped his leaky pen in it, so right away you are treated with cheese. Anyhow, the ship leaves and the adults don't believe the children. Elsewhere, we see Vincent Schiavelli, whom I find to be a terrific actor (watch his scenes in `Ghost' for proof, as they are outstanding), who is playing a prospector, or as I called him, the Miner 1949er. He steps out of the cave he is in, and he and his dog are inked by the ship. Twenty-five years go by, and the girl has grown up to be Cybill Shepherd, who works with her father, Raymond Burr, in studying unusual weather phenomena. Or something like that. Shepherd spots some strange phenomena in satellite pictures over that little New Mexico town, and she travels there to research it. Once she gets there, the local ranchers harass her, and blame her for the recent slew of cattle mutilations that have been going on, and deputy Jan-Michael Vincent comes to her rescue. From this point on, the film really drags as the two quickly fall for each other, especially after Vincent wards off the locals and informs Shepherd that he was the little boy that saw the ship with her twenty-five years earlier. While this boring mess is happening, Vincent Schiavelli, with his killer dog at his side, is walking around killing the cattle and any people he runs into with an unusual item. You know those glowing plastic sticks stores sell for trick-or-treaters at Halloween, the kind that you shake to make them glow? Schiavelli uses what looks like one of those glow sticks to burn incisions in people. It's the second-worst effect in the movie. Every time Schiavelli is on screen with the glow stick, the scene's atmosphere suddenly turns dark, like the filmmakers thought the glow stick needed that enhancement. It ends up making the movie look even cheaper than it is.<br /><br />And what does all this lead up to? It's hard to tell when the final, confusing scene arrives. See, Burr and his team of scientists try to explain the satellite images that Shepherd found as some kind of `calling card,' but none of it makes sense. Why do Shepherd and Vincent age and Schiavelli does not? Schiavelli explains why he is killing cattle and people and why he wants Shepherd dead, but even that doesn't make much sense when you really think about it. I mean, why doesn't he kill Jan-Michael Vincent? After all, he had twenty-five years to do it. And the aliens won't need him if Shepherd is dead anyhow, so why try to kill her? Speaking of the aliens, it is never clear what they really wanted out of Shepherd and Vincent. What is their goal? Why do they wait so long to intervene? How could they be so sure Shepherd would come back? Not that the answer to any of these and other questions would have made `The Return' any more pleasant. You would still have bad lines, really bad acting, particularly by Shepherd, cheesy effects, and poor direction. Luckily, the stars escaped from this movie. Cybill Shepherd soon went on to star in `Moonlighting' with Bruce Willis. Jan-Michael Vincent went on to be featured in dozens of B-movies, often in over-the-top parts. Raymond Burr made a pile of Perry Mason television movies right up until his death. Vincent Schiavelli went on to be a great character actor in a huge number of films. Martin Landau, who played a kooky law enforcement officer, quickly made the terrific `Alone in the Dark' and the awful `The Being' before rolling into the films he has been famous for recently.

{"value":"SLIGHT SPOILERS (but it doesn't matter anyway).<br /><br />An exercise in gobblygook of catastrophic proportions not even worthy of the l0 lines I need to put these remarks on the netwaves. This is the single worst episode of the Masters series to date and the first that qualifies for the defunct Mystery Science Theatre treatment. Even if it took me a full half hour to realize the intended ironic angle, it was still a very lame mess. Its sole value lies in the perspective that forces one to realize that in addition to gore and ugly masks the genre only succeeds when the classic cinematic notions of photography and lighting, dialogue and acting, editing and timing are put to use. Here they are absent and John Carpenter is no master. Period. And no trite analysis of the easy social comment herein will change that. Oddly, Carpenter never has been anything more than a B director, but at least such films as 'Fog' and 'The Thing' had terrific atmosphere (the latter is one of my cult favorites).<br /><br />Abominable acting. Camera angles stuck in cement. Tensionless rhythm. Yet perhaps the single most obnoxious element of the episode is the storyline which of course JC cannot really be blamed for (unless the writers were buddies of Cody.) The initial two minute slo-mo of a girl running through a forest only to be nearly run over by a would be Scully-Mulder duo is the first and last thing that works in the film. But come on, a girl hurtling through a deserted woods to nowhere in particular in desperate need of an abortion fortuitously rendez-vous with the fender of a pair of 'women's rights' MDs whose clinic just happens to be at the end of the road around the corner. Oh, and I won't even nitpick about how the doc whips the accidentee into the car and speeds away at 0 to 60 in six seconds. Does wonders for possible broken ribs or concussion.<br /><br />Then things fall apart real quick. The vacuous dialogue \"I just want to help you\", the interminably sluggish back and forth at the gate, grandiose battle tactics like cutting the telephone line (in the age of cell phones?) followed by the the shoot-out: a born-again Ramboesque clinic director vs Ron Perlman and the high school bullpen out for a few kicks at Easter break. Another lovely line: \"So what are we going to do?\" from the kid who had just been sitting on a pile of assault rifles in the back of the van. Er, no it isn't yet pheasant season. So who needs those teen boys anyway. What about the good old tried and true method of the lone lunatic who bashes his way through the gate with his all-American SUV?<br /><br />As for the exchange of bullets scenes themselves, the cuts here were as stiff as the staccato of a DC comics strip. All that was lacking were the Wham, Bam, and Whiz of the balloon titles. And all to the tune of a soundtrack worthy of an old Mannix episode.<br /><br />At one point we learn that Daddy isn't really the daddy, but at this point we haven't been led to care much any more either. This story's single source of drama is the conflict between the pro-life father and his pregnant daughter who is only thankful she's not having twins. Yet there is not a single scene, flashback or not, where they are actually ever found together. They remain mere abstractions to each other throughout.<br /><br />With the exception of the gatekeeper every single one of the characters is absolutely dislikeable. Bland, hysterical, dull-headed, macho. As perfectly flat as human wallpaper can be. None of the doctors seem to have anything medical about them. And there's that bickering Dad who rails at his pregnant daughter as though he himself were the stressed out boyfriend. He fortunately got his. There are two great MST-worthy comic moments: the gusher when Angelica's plumbing goes out and later the new-born lobster with a glued on baby's head. Also cute was Angelica's rugby ball belly before she finally popped the right-to-life little monster from Hell. As for that audacious male abortion scene...well, they should have retained Miike's episode and banned this one instead.<br /><br />In short, a 3rd rate Rosemary's Baby meets Alien set on the turf of a M.A.S.H. episode. This stinker alone, appreciable only to today's permissive under-16 generation, will assure as someone else said here, that this series will not be renewed for a third season. A real shame, since there have been a number of brilliant productions, including such really decent spoofs as Dante's 'Homecoming' or McKee's deliciously quirky 'Sick Girl'. Not to mention the superb imagery of Malone's 'Fairhaired Child'.<br /><br />Sorry John Carpenter, I believe your directing days are over. It's time to run for President.","finished_norm":["slight","spoiler","but","it","doe","not","matt","anywaybr","br","a","exercis","in","gobblygook","of","catastroph","proport","not","even","worthi","of","the","l","line","i","ne","to","put","thi","remark","on","the","netwav","thi","be","the","singl","wrong","episod","of","the","master","seri","to","date","and","the","that","qualifi","for","the","defunct","mysteri","scienc","theatr","treatment","even","if","it","take","me","a","full","half","hour","to","realiz","the","intend","iron","angl","it","be","still","a","veri","lame","mess","it","sole","valu","lie","in","the","perspect","that","forc","on","to","realiz","that","in","addit","to","gore","and","ugli","mask","the","genr","onli","succ","when","the","classic","cinemat","notion","of","photographi","and","light","dialogu","and","act","edit","and","time","be","put","to","us","here","thei","be","absent","and","john","carpent","be","no","master","period","and","no","trite","analysi","of","the","easi","social","comment","herein","will","chang","that","oddli","carpent","never","have","be","anyth","much","than","a","b","director","but","at","littl","such","film","a","fog","and","the","thing","have","terrif","atmospher","the","latter","be","on","of","my","cult","favoritesbr","br","abomin","act","camera","angl","stick","in","cement","tensionless","rhythm","yet","perhap","the","singl","much","obnoxi","elem","of","the","episod","be","the","storylin","which","of","cours","jc","cannot","realli","be","blame","for","unless","the","writer","be","buddi","of","codi","the","initi","two","minut","slomo","of","a","girl","run","through","a","forest","onli","to","be","nearli","run","over","by","a","would","be","scullymuld","duo","be","the","and","last","thing","that","work","in","the","film","but","come","on","a","girl","hurtl","through","a","desert","wood","to","nowher","in","particular","in","desper","ne","of","a","abort","fortuit","rendezv","with","the","fender","of","a","pair","of","woman","right","md","whose","clinic","just","happen","to","be","at","the","end","of","the","road","around","the","corner","oh","and","i","wo","not","even","nitpick","about","how","the","doc","whip","the","accidente","into","the","car","and","spe","awai","at","to","in","six","second","doe","wonder","for","possibl","break","rib","or","concussionbr","br","then","thing","fall","apart","real","quick","the","vacuou","dialogu","i","just","want","to","help","you","the","intermin","sluggish","back","and","forth","at","the","gate","grandios","battl","tactic","like","cut","the","telephon","line","in","the","ag","of","cell","phone","follow","by","the","the","shootout","a","bornagain","ramboesqu","clinic","director","v","ron","perlman","and","the","high","school","bullpen","out","for","a","few","kick","at","easter","break","anoth","love","line","so","what","be","we","go","to","do","from","the","kid","who","have","just","be","sit","on","a","pile","of","assault","rifl","in","the","back","of","the","van","er","no","it","be","not","yet","pheasant","season","so","who","ne","that","teen","boi","anywai","what","about","the","good","old","try","and","true","method","of","the","lone","lunat","who","bash","hi","wai","through","the","gate","with","hi","allamerican","suvbr","br","a","for","the","exchang","of","bullet","scene","themselv","the","cut","here","be","a","stiff","a","the","staccato","of","a","dc","comic","strip","all","that","be","lack","be","the","wham","bam","and","whiz","of","the","balloon","titl","and","all","to","the","tune","of","a","soundtrack","worthi","of","a","old","mannix","episodebr","br","at","on","point","we","learn","that","daddi","be","not","realli","the","daddi","but","at","thi","point","we","have","not","be","lead","to","care","much","ani","much","either","thi","stori","singl","sourc","of","drama","be","the","conflict","between","the","prolif","father","and","hi","pregnant","daughter","who","be","onli","thank","she","not","have","twin","yet","there","be","not","a","singl","scene","flashback","or","not","where","thei","be","actual","ever","find","togeth","thei","remain","mere","abstract","to","each","other","throughoutbr","br","with","the","except","of","the","gatekeep","everi","singl","on","of","the","charact","be","absolut","dislik","bland","hyster","dullhead","macho","a","perfectli","flat","a","human","wallpap","can","be","none","of","the","doctor","seem","to","have","anyth","medic","about","them","and","there","that","bicker","dad","who","rail","at","hi","pregnant","daughter","a","though","he","himself","be","the","stress","out","boyfriend","he","fortun","get","hi","there","be","two","great","mstworthi","comic","moment","the","gusher","when","angelica","plumb","go","out","and","late","the","newborn","lobster","with","a","glue","on","babi","head","conjur","cute","be","angelica","rugbi","ball","belli","befor","she","final","pop","the","righttolif","littl","monster","from","hell","a","for","that","audaci","male","abort","scenewel","thei","should","have","retain","miik

{"value":"Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology. Actually, a lot of people do. And I'll start. I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk, because of the near unanimous bad reviews. Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it. I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and, wow....<br /><br />SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE'S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK <br /><br />Was it boring! I almost didn't make it through Ang Lee's Hulk. Eric Bana was expressionless, Nick Nolte was horrible, Sam Elliott was unlikeable (and that's no fun, he's usually a cool character). In fact, I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non-descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics - and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non-angry state. When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever.<br /><br />But then something happened. About 3/4 of the way through this tedious movie, there was a genuinely exciting and - dare I say it - reasonably convincing - extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base, fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert, then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere, only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco. This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie. And I have to say, the CGI was quite good. That's not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing. But it didn't require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non-superhero action movies. And that's quite a feat.<br /><br />Of course, the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banner's father turning into some sort of shape-shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Man's brief heroics to shame. And overall, apart from the animated mutant dogs, it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment. It was certainly better than I expected.<br /><br />OK, but what about The Incredible Hulk? Guess what... It's boring too! It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and here's the thing - the CGI in this movie is horrible. Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee's version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others - but it had its convincing moments also. The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous. It had skin tone and muscle tone that didn't even look like a living creature, just some sort of computer-generated texture. It was really preposterous. The lighting, environment and facial effects didn't look 5 years newer than Ang Lee's, they looked 10 years older. And there really is no excuse for that. We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director, actor or cinematographer ever could.<br /><br />Worse, the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee's \"failure\". All the same mistakes are made. Bruce Banner is practically emotionless. The general is so relentlessly, implausibly one-dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk. The love interest is unconvincing (I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly, though both are quite easy on the eyes). Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte, even though he's only in the movie for a few minutes. The Hulk really doesn't do much in this movie, certainly not any more than in Ang Lee's version. The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast-paced, but since nothing really happened anyway that's not worth much. Oh yeah, the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk. He's actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster. <br /><br />This is how I can definitively say Ang Lee's version was better: if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lee's version again, I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences, or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more (more likely I'd just fast forward to the good parts). But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once, let alone twice. It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies. The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience - at least in Ang Lee's version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic (except for the giant poodle, of course).<br /><br />It is absolutely mind-boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee's Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie. <br /><br />It is to Edward Norton's credit that

{"value":"And I repeat, please do not see this movie! This is more than a review. This is a warning. This sets the record for the worst, most effortless comedy ever made. At least with most of the recent comedies nowadays, the gags are crude and flat, but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny. I never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos: Everyone thinks they can do comedy, and only 10 percent of them are right. Comedy is hard! This is not some genre any fool can play around with. I think it's atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to \"Kentucky Fried Movie.\" Basically, these bozos are comparing their so-called comic talents to those of the brilliant Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers. Come on, I've seen Pauly Shore movies that are 10 times funnier than \"The Underground Comedy Movie.\" Here's a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie: One sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named D**kman. The whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen. That's it. That's the whole joke. Wow. This is enough to make Carrot Top roll his eyes. Another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie. And in another sketch, there's a bag lady beauty contest, in which we're exposed to the horrible sights of bikini-clad middle-aged women with beer guts and stretch marks. Plus, making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny. It's a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped. The whole movie is supposed to be a satire. I think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire...is TRUTH!!! For anybody who actually enjoyed this crap, explain to me what is truthful about ANY of these gags! Some of the sketches might've sounded funny on paper, but anybody who's taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper, it probably won't be funny on screen. If I tell someone about a big, black, muscular gay virgin, who's saving himself for the right man, he or she would probably laugh. But watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag. I hate how whenever people criticize a low-brow comedy like this for not being funny, they're regarded as stuck-up squares. I just saw \"White Chicks\" recently. That's another low-brow, politically incorrect comedy, but I laughed my head off. The most offensive thing about \"The Underground Comedy Movie\" is it's not funny! What the writers and directors don't understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn't work. There has to be more! Just think of the famous scene from \"There's Something About Mary\" (ironically, enough the bozo filmmakers put the Farrellys on their special thanks list). The joke about the semen wasn't just funny because it involved bodily fluids. There was a buildup. Ben Stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn't go out on a date with a \"loaded gun.\" Then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released. A knock is on the door, and he has to answer it. His date, Mary, is at the door and that's when it's revealed that the semen is hanging off Ben's ear. In this movie, there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people, with no buildup whatsoever. As Jay Leno always says, \"This comedy thing's not so easy, is it?\" Keep that in mind, Vince Offer, 'cause you weren't cut out for this genre!! The only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip. Let's face it, nowadays it's hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect. I know comedy is subjective...but this movie shouldn't be funny to anybody, except maybe the filmmakers themselves. As a side note, the movie had to have been made before Michael Clarke Duncan's fame in movies like \"Armageddon\" and \"The Green Mile.\" There can't be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show. All the others in the cast are either non-actors, has-been actors or B-movie stars. Karen Black made a good impression in \"Five Easy Pieces,\" but I don't think she's done anything of value ever since. Slash was probably drugged into being in this film. Gina Lee Nolin is nothing without \"Baywatch.\" Angelyne is the film's biggest star (keeping in mind Duncan wasn't famous at the time), and there are still probably a ton of people who haven't heard of her--for good reason. Usually, I'm in support of extremely low-budget flicks, but this one deserves to drift into obscurity. I hope to Lord this doesn't become a cult classic!

this?","finished_norm":["and","i","repeat","pleas","do","not","see","thi","movi","thi","be","much","than","a","review","thi","be","a","warn","thi","set","the","record","for","the","wrong","much","effortless","comedi","ever","make","at","littl","with","much","of","the","recent","comedi","nowadai","the","gag","be","crude","and","flat","but","the","writer","and","director","put","in","at","littl","some","sort","of","effort","into","make","them","funni","i","never","get","tire","of","repeat","on","of","my","favorit","motto","everyon","think","thei","can","do","comedi","and","onli","percent","of","them","be","right","comedi","be","hard","thi","be","not","some","genr","ani","fool","can","plai","around","with","i","think","it","atroci","that","the","filmmak","be","compar","thi","piec","of","garbag","to","kentucki","fry","movi","basic","thi","bozo","be","compar","their","socal","comic","talent","to","that","of","the","brilliant","jim","abraham","and","the","zucker","brother","come","on","i","have","see","pauli","shore","movi","that","be","time","funni","than","the","underground","comedi","movi","here","a","sampl","of","the","comedi","for","that","curiou","about","see","thi","movi","on","sketch","involv","a","superhero","dress","like","a","peni","name","dkman","the","whole","joke","be","that","he","defeat","hi","enemi","by","squirt","them","with","semen","that","it","that","the","whole","joke","wow","thi","be","enough","to","make","carrot","top","roll","hi","ey","anoth","sketch","involv","a","man","have","sex","with","a","dead","person","in","a","porn","movi","and","in","anoth","sketch","there","a","bag","ladi","beauti","contest","in","which","we","re","expos","to","the","horribl","sight","of","bikiniclad","middleag","woman","with","beer","gut","and","stretch","mark","plu","make","fun","of","the","homeless","be","much","sad","than","funni","it","a","step","awai","from","mock","the","mental","handicap","the","whole","movi","be","suppos","to","be","a","satir","i","think","the","filmmak","forget","that","a","kei","elem","of","satirei","truth","for","anybodi","who","actual","enjoi","thi","crap","explain","to","me","what","be","truth","about","ani","of","thi","gag","some","of","the","sketch","mai","have","sound","funni","on","paper","but","anybodi","who","take","ani","screen","write","class","know","that","if","a","sight","gag","sound","too","funni","on","paper","it","probabl","wo","not","be","funni","on","screen","if","i","tell","someon","about","a","big","black","muscular","gai","virgin","who","save","himself","for","the","right","man","he","or","she","would","probabl","laugh","but","watch","the","premis","plai","out","on","screen","for","about","minut","be","a","complet","drag","i","hate","how","whenev","peopl","critic","a","lowbrow","comedi","like","thi","for","not","be","funni","thei","re","regard","a","stuckup","squar","i","just","see","white","chick","recent","that","anoth","lowbrow","polit","incorrect","comedi","but","i","laugh","my","head","off","the","much","offens","thing","about","the","underground","comedi","movi","be","it","not","funni","what","the","writer","and","director","do","not","understand","be","that","mere","be","filthi","and","tasteless","doe","not","work","there","have","to","be","much","just","think","of","the","famou","scene","from","there","someth","about","mari","iron","enough","the","bozo","filmmak","put","the","farrelli","on","their","special","thank","list","the","joke","about","the","semen","be","not","just","funni","becaus","it","involv","bodili","fluid","there","be","a","buildup","ben","still","be","masturb","in","the","bathroom","to","make","sure","he","do","not","go","out","on","a","date","with","a","load","gun","then","he","look","around","to","see","where","all","the","semen","go","after","it","be","releas","a","knock","be","on","the","door","and","he","have","to","answer","it","hi","date","mari","be","at","the","door","and","that","when","it","reveal","that","the","semen","be","hang","off","ben","ear","in","thi","movi","there","be","multipl","gag","involv","charact","squirt","load","of","semen","at","peopl","with","no","buildup","whatsoev","a","jai","leno","alwai","sai","thi","comedi","thing","not","so","easi","be","it","keep","that","in","mind","vinc","offer","caus","you","be","not","cut","out","for","thi","genr","the","onli","reason","peopl","mai","laugh","at","thi","gag","be","becaus","thei","want","to","feel","hip","let","face","it","nowadai","it","hip","to","laugh","at","anyth","polit","incorrect","i","know","comedi","be","subjectivebut","thi","movi","should","not","be","funni","to","anybodi","except","mayb","the","filmmak","themselv","a","a","side","note","the","movi","have","to","have","be","make","befor","michael","clark","duncan","fame","in","movi","like","armageddon","and","the","green","mile","there","ca","not","be","ani","other","reason","why","a","actor","of","hi","calib","would","volunt","to","be","part","of","thi","amateurish","freak","show","all","the","other","in"
