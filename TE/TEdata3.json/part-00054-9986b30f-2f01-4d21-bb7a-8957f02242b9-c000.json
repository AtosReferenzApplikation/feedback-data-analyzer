{"value":"I saw this movie on the film festival of Rotterdam (jan '06) and followed the discussion between director and public afterwards. Many people reacted shocked and protesting. He will get a lot of negative critics. But: the world is cruel like this, and it's not funny. People don't like it. That itself doesn't mean that the movie is bad. I can see that difference. Don't shoot the messenger that shows us the world outside our 'hubble'! Nevertheless I think this a bad movie. Film-technically it's a good one. Nice shots and script, most good fitting music, great actors. The director pretends to make a psychological movie, - the psychology however is of poor quality. Describing such a powerful violence itself is not the art. The art would be a powerful description of the psychological process behind that violence. How does a shy boy come to such a cruelty? The director pretends to describe that, - but is not good in that.<br /><br />The director used several times the word the 'selfishness' of people, mentioning for instance the teacher. Only: this teacher wasn't selfish,- just someone in several roles, caring for his pupils, ánd worried about his script. I think it's a simplification to call him selfish. The atmosphere in the village is creepy, and the mother made awful mistakes ('you terribly let me down') but it doesn't become believable for me, that there is caused súch a lot of pain, that the shyest boy comes to such terrible things. In fact, reality is far more complex than the way, this film describes  and it needs far better descriptions. The interesting thing would be: how does it work? Describe that process for me please, so that we understand.<br /><br />With the written phrase on the end, the director said to point to an alternative way of life. It was the other extreme, and confirmed for me that director and scriptwriter are bad psychologists, promoting black/white-thinking. The connection between violence in films and in society has been proved. Use such a violence gives the responsibility to use it right. There are enough black/white-thinkers in the world, causing lots of war and misery. I hope, this movie won't be successful.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","movi","on","the","film","festiv","of","rotterdam","jan","and","follow","the","discuss","between","director","and","public","afterward","mani","peopl","react","shock","and","protest","he","will","get","a","lot","of","neg","critic","but","the","world","be","cruel","like","thi","and","it","not","funni","peopl","do","not","like","it","that","itself","doe","not","mean","that","the","movi","be","bad","i","can","see","that","differ","do","not","shoot","the","messeng","that","show","u","the","world","outsid","our","hubbl","nevertheless","i","think","thi","a","bad","movi","filmtechn","it","a","good","on","nice","shot","and","script","much","good","fit","music","great","actor","the","director","pretend","to","make","a","psycholog","movi","the","psychologi","howev","be","of","poor","qualiti","describ","such","a","power","violenc","itself","be","not","the","art","the","art","would","be","a","power","descript","of","the","psycholog","process","behind","that","violenc","how","doe","a","shy","boi","come","to","such","a","cruelti","the","director","pretend","to","describ","that","but","be","not","good","in","thatbr","br","the","director","us","sever","time","the","word","the","selfish","of","peopl","mention","for","instanc","the","teacher","onli","thi","teacher","be","not","selfish","just","someon","in","sever","role","care","for","hi","pupil","ánd","worri","about","hi","script","i","think","it","a","simplif","to","call","him","selfish","the","atmospher","in","the","villag","be","creepi","and","the","mother","make","aw","mistak","you","terribli","let","me","down","but","it","doe","not","becom","believ","for","me","that","there","be","caus","súch","a","lot","of","pain","that","the","shy","boi","come","to","such","terribl","thing","in","fact","realiti","be","far","much","complex","than","the","wai","thi","film","describ","and","it","ne","far","well","descript","the","interest","thing","would","be","how","doe","it","work","describ","that","process","for","me","pleas","so","that","we","understandbr","br","with","the","write","phrase","on","the","end","the","director","sai","to","point","to","a","altern","wai","of","life","it","be","the","other","extrem","and","confirm","for","me","that","director","and","scriptwrit","be","bad","psychologist","promot","blackwhitethink","the","connect","between","violenc","in","film","and","in","societi","have","be","prove","us","such","a","violenc","give","the","respons","to","us","it","right","there","be","enough","blackwhitethink","in","the","world","caus","lot","of","war","and","miseri","i","hope","thi","movi","wo","not","be","success"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","film","festiv","rotterdam","jan","follow","discuss","director","public","afterward","mani","peopl","react","shock","protest","get","lot","neg","critic","world","cruel","like","thi","funni","peopl","like","doe","mean","movi","bad","see","differ","shoot","messeng","show","u","world","outsid","hubbl","nevertheless","think","thi","bad","movi","filmtechn","good","nice","shot","script","much","good","fit","music","great","actor","director","pretend","make","psycholog","movi","psychologi","howev","poor","qualiti","describ","power","violenc","art","art","power","descript","psycholog","process","behind","violenc","doe","shy","boi","come","cruelti","director","pretend","describ","good","thatbr","br","director","us","sever","time","word","selfish","peopl","mention","instanc","teacher","onli","thi","teacher","selfish","someon","sever","role","care","hi","pupil","ánd","worri","hi","script","think","simplif","call","selfish","atmospher","villag","creepi","mother","make","aw","mistak","terribli","let","doe","becom","believ","caus","súch","lot","pain","shy","boi","come","terribl","thing","fact","realiti","far","much","complex","wai","thi","film","describ","ne","far","well","descript","interest","thing","doe","work","describ","process","pleas","understandbr","br","write","phrase","end","director","sai","point","altern","wai","life","extrem","confirm","director","scriptwrit","bad","psychologist","promot","blackwhitethink","connect","violenc","film","societi","prove","us","violenc","give","respons","us","right","enough","blackwhitethink","world","caus","lot","war","miseri","hope","thi","movi","wo","success"],"filtered2":["see","festiv","rotterdam","jan","follow","discuss","director","public","afterward","mani","peopl","react","shock","protest","get","lot","neg","critic","world","cruel","like","funni","peopl","like","doe","mean","bad","see","differ","shoot","messeng","show","u","world","outsid","hubbl","nevertheless","think","bad","filmtechn","good","nice","shot","script","good","fit","music","great","actor","director","pretend","make","psycholog","psychologi","howev","poor","qualiti","describ","power","violenc","art","art","power","descript","psycholog","process","behind","violenc","doe","shy","boi","come","cruelti","director","pretend","describ","good","thatbr","director","us","sever","time","word",

{"value":"Only the Antichrist could have been behind such a disaster. One only hopes that this irony was the motivating force behind the \"film\"! This movie was so bad, it forced me to register with IMDb, finally, just so I could trash it. What makes this movie all the more tragic is that it had such GREAT source material! I have never seen a movie where all the elements were so grotesquely mediocre as to render the result less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />It may seem insignificant, but I'd like to start with the score. As the proud owner of a music degree, I must register my indignation! I was torn between laughter and dry heaves as I listened to what John Scheffer did to Goldsmith's brilliant score; it was far more gruesome than any of the burlesque death scenes, and almost as inadvertently comedic. It was by far the most inappropriate score I've heard since, well, I really can't think of a worse one. Maybe JAWS 4?<br /><br />As for the plot... I'm sorry. New Age mysticism??? What ever happened to the gritty realism of the original trilogy? In those films (more so in the first two than the third, but still!!) the supernatural was for the most part implied, and it was this subtlety that made the movies so eerily believable. Here we have crystals going black (calling all Skeksis and Mystics!!) and inverted crucifixes galore, even though in certain scenes the crucifux would be perfectly normal but for the camera angle. Gone is the refined psychlogical manipulation tapping the malaise inherent in our collective psyche: in its place a boorish \"slap in the face\" of recycled cliché and transparent incompetence. Add to that a lead \"actress\" so unbelievably ANNOYING that you fervently thank the director for those scenes from which she is absent. Never have I seen a little girl so fundamentally irritating since little Stephanie ruined ALL IN THE FAMILY.<br /><br />Other than that, I have no strong feelings on the subject ;-) Luckily the first three films are sufficiently adroit as to render this train-wreck of wasted celluloid inconsequential or, at the very most, a study in how NOT to make a film.

So the wife hits upon a major plan - surrogate mother...but the scientists intervened - \"Sure artificial insemination\" - NO said the artist (Director actually) - \"Neighbourhood will come to know that the daughter - in - law is barren so they are going for surrogate mother !!<br /><br />Neighbours ! society !! gosh the same ones who watch Fashion TV day and night - watching girls between the age group of 14 to 40 ...al in bras and panties - well those neighbors suddenly take an upper hand in family planning and decision making !!<br /><br />SO the wife sends away her husband to a beer bar where girls are dancing on the stage - all mostly uneducated and illiterate - but men love such women as they can satisfy their egos a lot !<br /><br />He hires the lead dancer in the pub - asks her to bear his baby - in exchange for money - she agrees - she comes home - becomes pregnant - wife and kept - both co-exist in the same house - in the mean time the prostitute also gets a taste of household life - so much caring people around - she misses them all and cries silently !! In the mean time - no one in the family comes to know that the real daughter in law is roaming around with a pillow beneath her petticoat !!- the mother or other elderly people never took her for check-ups - nor did they try to feel the baby's movements in the womb

The film directed by Lek Kitaparaporn after a screenplay by Sean Casey based on historical fact in 1547 Siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest, pedestrian scripts and story development on film.<br /><br />The event the picture relates is the arrival of the Portuguese soldier of fortune Fernando de Gamma (Gary Stretch) whose vengeance for this father's murderer drives him to shipwrecked, captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in Ayutthaya in the kingdom of Siam where he is purchased by the beautiful Maria (Cindy Burbridge) with the consent of her father Phillipe (John Rhys-Davies), a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses. There is a plot to overthrown the King and Fernando and his new Siamese sidekick Tong (Dom Hetrakul), after some gratuitous CGI enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness, are first rewarded by the King to become his bodyguards, only to be imprisoned together once Queen Sudachan (Yoe Hassadeevichit) reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover Lord Chakkraphat (Oliver Pupart) to take over the rule of Siam. Yet of course Fernando and Tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families (Tong's wife and children and Fernando's now firm love affair with Maria) with the expected consequences.<br /><br />The acting (with the exception of John Rhys-Davies) is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp. The predominantly Thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog, making us wish they had used their native Thai with subtitles. The musical score by Ian Livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old TV soap operas. But if it is visual splendor you're after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching. It is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions. It is just the basics that are missing.

{"value":"This makes the third Errol Morris movie I've seen, and I'm increasingly not liking his style. He seems to find very interesting and varied characters, great personalities to create documentaries for, and then with tongue-in-cheek editing make fun of everything they are about. It's never really a direct caricaturation of them and Morris seems most of the time to be saying, \"But no, no, these people are really fascinating, really!\", but there's always these subtle little canted angles and not-so-subtle editing techniques that show that Morris seems to be mocking them behind their back.<br /><br />This movie tracks four people who break the traditional boundaries of organic separation... a man who studies African hairless molerats to find that they are amazingly ant-like, a lion tamer, a man who keeps a garden full of animal-shaped shrubbery, and a robot designer. The general theme of the film seems to revolve around the question of what designates animal, human, and life features? So the title of Fast, Cheap, & Out of Control doesn't really seem to mean anything in terms of the movie... right? Except of course Morris seems just a little disturbed by these individuals' passions (he might call them \"obsessions\") making synthetic designs on life. I share not that fear and honestly don't appreciate some of the connections Morris makes in the film.<br /><br />But I stress his subtlety. With no voice-over narration and leaving the words entirely to the interviewees, it's not as if Morris ever pounds that anxiety onto the spectators' collective head. Instead he mixes circus footage and ant footage together often at times when they're taken out of the context of the circus and the ants, showing a sort of collective absurdity behind what all of these people are talking about.

{"value":"If this is someone's \"favorite\" movie, they need some serious help. There is nothing funny or clever about this crapfest. I haven't seen the original movie this is the remake of (some 1950s film), but it simply has to be better than this newer bastardization.<br /><br />A major gets kicked out of the military for being a fringe element, and winds up teaching children at an ROTC school. Unfortunately, the major is Daman Wayans... so the children are in for a world of annoying, humorless asininity. Can Wayans whip these losers into shape? Can they get him to become a little more human? The film bombs as most Wayans films do, with only a few sparkling moments. William Hickey gets about one minute of screen time, fair too little. This charming old man (known best to me as a \"Tales from the Crypt\" actor, known best to you as Uncle Louis from \"Christmas Vacation\") shines every moment he's on screen, which isn't much here.<br /><br />Bam Bam Bigelow also makes an appearance as a biker, which fits him perfectly. I wouldn't mind slightly more Bam Bam, but I think he carried the role of \"biker\" about as far as it could be carried for a military film.<br /><br />And then there's the attractive teacher, who someone falls for Major Payne even though he treats the kids poorly, has no social skills and is simply impossible to convert into someone you would want to spend time with. She must either be incredibly stupid or incredibly desperate. I'm not sure which (though it would seem \"stupid\" since the movie makes it clear she gets out of the house often enough).<br /><br />Wayans had one shining moment: a dance sequence where he performs a series of moves (including a very nice \"robot\"), and with the help of music from 2 Live Crew. This scene was enjoyable but hardly made up for anything else that made this film dog spittle.<br /><br />Seriously, avoid this film. If you want to see a film a bout a loser who helps loser kids become heroes, rent or buy \"Ernest Goes to Camp\". At least he's a lovable loser, and actually funny.

{"value":"'1408' is the latest hodge podge of cheap scare tactics. The kind that might make date-movie styled horror fans occasionally jump in their seat and scream in your ear, but disappoint audiences searching for a little depth and direction.<br /><br />John Cusak plays a writer who's made a career of writing books describing his experiences of staying in rumored haunted hotels. Despite assurances by patrons and owners that ghosts roam the halls, there is little to make him a real believer in the paranormal. When he learns of the history of Room 1408 at the Overlook Hotel--no wait, I mean, Dolphin Hotel in New York City--he decides it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book. But, Samuel L. Jackson, playing the hotel owner, strongly attempts to dissuade his guest with narration of the atrocities that have occurred in theat room since the hotel's opening many years ago. The story is simple and we, as possible skeptics, must sit through Jackson's lengthy foreshadowing ramble. <br /><br />In other words: be afraid! Be very afraid!<br /><br />Of course, it would be easy to convince audiences that they've just paid to see an edge-of-the-seat thriller if it didn't take so long to build up to this point. And also, if what followed was a lot more than cheap \"boos\" that become so frequent and arbitrary that eventually, you might soon expect them. The temperature in the room changes automatically. The walls drip with blood. The fearless writer can't open the door, etc. And after nearly an hour and a half of delivering these to audiences promised big thrills, you might sit and hope that at least you can be wowed by the ending. With suspicions of dream sequences and other derivative time-wasters, even that fails to quell our doubts that before the movie is over, we might finally have something to make the movie a little less than completely forgettable.<br /><br />Despite grand performances (as always) by Cusak, who essentially is the entire film, most everyone else of note is wasted (i.e. Samuel L.

{"value":"The easiest way to describe this movie is as a satire. The target of the satire is quite vast, from the US Government to corporate America. It is also not a stinging satire, but rather a silly one.<br /><br />Think of this movie as a mix between the Kentucky Fried movie, Airplane and Police Squad series, done with a much smaller budget and not as funny. I can see how this movie is a satire of many sci-fi disaster movies from the 50's and 60's. I see this movie as a big influence on Tim Burton's Mars Attacks.<br /><br />The plot is simple enough. Genetically engineered giant tomatoes go \"crazy\" and start attacking people and cities. At first there is a cover up and then it blows over into full blown war.<br /><br />The movie runs the gamut of characters and characterizations : Lois \"Fairchild\" (a Lois Lane clone), a very ambitious Presidential Press Secretary, Clark Kent, Mason Dixon (FIA agent who hasn't worked since the Bay of Pigs), a useless President (who only seems to be able to sign his name and attack New York), an even inept Congress, a sleazy marketing CEO, and Mason's team consisting of an obese East German \"female\" swimmer, a scuba diver, a crazed WWII paratrooper and an African-American disguise expert (disguised as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Hitler and finally as a tomato). Did I also forget to mention, lots and lots of tomatoes? There are all kinds of tomatoes from small tomatoes, to giant plastic tomatoes, to smashed tomatoes, to tomato juice and finally to people dressed up as tomatoes.<br /><br />On top of all this, you have a couple of musical numbers as well. They aren't that good and seem to be dubbed. The best tune is by far the theme of the movie (\"Attack of the Killer Tomatoes\"). It is way too catchy and you might end up humming or singing it in public. Be warned.<br /><br />Most of the movie is quite amusing and shows the absurdity of various real life situations as well as various entertainment genres. I don't believe I was induced to laughter, but mostly smiled and scratched my head. I definitely recommend this movie for fans of B and C grade movies, but only as a rental.<br /><br />-Celluloid

{"value":"I am a Christian and I say this movie had terrible acting, unreal situations and a completely facade front for Christianity. You might as well watch \"Remember the Titans\" and at least not mix Christ in a football film like a formulaic steroid for losers. Let me make some really pressing comments of what bothered me in this film.<br /><br />1. The school was in Georgia and was a white academy school. I did not notice a single black student or player in the school. I deal with the White \"Christian\" Academies in the south and they were built for no other reason than to reestablish segregation. This is troubling when the movie is about Christianity and Christ changing lives...how about changing the hearts of segregation? (note: I loved the token black coach; like it made up for the entirely white team and all the black 'Giants' players.) <br /><br />2. The uncritical acclaim by everyone Christian about this movie. Can I get a couple people to say that it was bad acting, bad filming, bad writing and in short poor compared to other movies. If we were to compare this to another football movie, would it have the same charisma and energy? <br /><br />3. The half-baked Christianity which was shown made even less sense to me than the unrealistic ending. If Christianity is about simply reading a little scripture and praying to begin a complete life change, then don't wonder when no one will listen to what Christians have to say. We want to sell Christ as a cure-all. He doesn't need sold and He doesn't need to be attached to such whimsical lifestyles. No wonder everyone considers Christianity to be anti-intellectual with this unreal presentation.<br /><br />I recognize this film may be inspirational to a few people. To most, it will not be. It will not give a real picture of struggle and heartfelt tension. Most importantly to me, it is not Christian by any means or stretch. It has values but it falls short as a 'pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps' message as shallow as positive thinking. If you live alongside people who struggle and/or those in third world living conditions, this movie will be hollow as most churches are today in their religion.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","christian","and","i","sai","thi","movi","have","terribl","act","unreal","situat","and","a","complet","facad","front","for","christian","you","mai","a","good","watch","rememb","the","titan","and","at","littl","not","mix","christ","in","a","footbal","film","like","a","formula","steroid","for","loser","let","me","make","some","realli","press","comment","of","what","bother","me","in","thi","filmbr","br","the","school","be","in","georgia","and","be","a","white","academi","school","i","do","not","notic","a","singl","black","student","or","player","in","the","school","i","deal","with","the","white","christian","academi","in","the","south","and","thei","be","build","for","no","other","reason","than","to","reestablish","segreg","thi","be","troubl","when","the","movi","be","about","christian","and","christ","chang","liveshow","about","chang","the","heart","of","segreg","note","i","love","the","token","black","coach","like","it","make","up","for","the","entir","white","team","and","all","the","black","giant","player","br","br","the","uncrit","acclaim","by","everyon","christian","about","thi","movi","can","i","get","a","coupl","peopl","to","sai","that","it","be","bad","act","bad","film","bad","write","and","in","short","poor","compar","to","other","movi","if","we","be","to","compar","thi","to","anoth","footbal","movi","would","it","have","the","same","charisma","and","energi","br","br","the","halfbak","christian","which","be","show","make","even","littl","sens","to","me","than","the","unrealist","end","if","christian","be","about","simpli","read","a","littl","scriptur","and","prai","to","begin","a","complet","life","chang","then","do","not","wonder","when","no","on","will","listen","to","what","christian","have","to","sai","we","want","to","sell","christ","a","a","cureal","he","doe","not","ne","sell","and","he","doe","not","ne","to","be","attach","to","such","whimsic","lifestyl","no","wonder","everyon","consid","christian","to","be","antiintellectu","with","thi","unreal","presentationbr","br","i","recogn","thi","film","mai","be","inspir","to","a","few","peopl","to","much","it","will","not","be","it","will","not","give","a","real","pictur","of","struggl","and","heartfelt","tension","much","importantli","to","me","it","be","not","christian","by","ani","mean","or","stretch","it","have","valu","but","it","fall","short","a","a","pullyourselfupbythebootstrap","messag","a","shallow","a","posit","think","if","you","live","alongsid","peopl","who","struggl","andor","that","in","world","live","condit","thi","movi","will","be","hollow","a","much","church","be","todai","in","their","religion"],"filtered":["christian","sai","thi","movi","terribl","act","unreal","situat","complet","facad","front","christian","mai","good","watch","rememb","titan","littl","mix","christ","footbal","film","like","formula","steroid","loser","let","make","realli","press","comment","bother","thi","filmbr","br","school","georgia","white","academi","school","notic","singl","black","student","player","school","deal","white","christian","academi","south","thei","build","reason","reestablish","segreg","thi","troubl","movi","christian","christ","chang","liveshow","chang","heart","segreg","note","love","token","black","coach","like","make","entir","white","team","black","giant","player","br","br","uncrit","acclaim","everyon","christian","thi","movi","get","coupl","peopl","sai","bad","act","bad","film","bad","write","short","poor","compar","movi","compar","thi","anoth","footbal","movi","charisma","energi","br","br","halfbak","christian","show","make","even","littl","sens","unrealist","end","christian","simpli","read","littl","scriptur","prai","begin","complet","life","chang","wonder","listen","christian","sai","want","sell","christ","cureal","doe","ne","sell","doe","ne","attach","whimsic","lifestyl","wonder","everyon","consid","christian","antiintellectu","thi","unreal","presentationbr","br","recogn","thi","film","mai","inspir","peopl","much","give","real","pictur","struggl","heartfelt","tension","much","importantli","christian","ani","mean","stretch","valu","fall","short","pullyourselfupbythebootstrap","messag","shallow","posit","think","live","alongsid","peopl","struggl","andor","world","live","condit","thi","movi","hollow","much","church","todai","religion"],"filtered2":["christian","terribl","act","unreal","situat","complet","facad","front","christian","mai","good","watch","rememb","titan","littl","mix","christ","footbal","like","formula","steroid","loser","let","make","realli","press","comment","bother","filmbr","school","georgia","white","academi","school","notic","singl","black","student","player","school","deal","white","christian","academi","south","build","reason","reestablish","segreg","troubl","christian","christ","chang","liveshow","chang","heart","segreg","note","love","token","black","coach","like","make","entir","white","team","black","giant","player","uncrit","acclaim","everyon","christian","get","coupl","p

{"value":"I saw this film on the History Channel today (in 2006). First of all, I realize that this is not a documentary -- that it is a drama. But, one might hope that at least the critical \"facts\" that the story turns on might be based on actual events. Reagan was shot and the other characters were real people. The movie got that right. From there on, reliance on facts rapidly decays. I had never heard of this movie before seeing it. Having been a TV reporter at the time of these events, I was stunned that I had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of Secretary Haig as portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss. The whole nation had heard the \"I am in control...\", etc., but Dreufuss' Haig is bullying a cowered cabinet and totally out of control personally. Having watched the film, I began researching the subject on the Internet and quickly found actual audio tapes and transcripts of most of the Situation Room conversations that this film pretends to reenact. Incredibly, many the the principal \"facts\" of the film meant to show a White House, Secret Service etc. in total chaos -- and the nation's leadership behaving irrationally and driving the world near the brink of nuclear war -- are demonstrably incorrect. They didn't happen! There is internal conflict, to be sure. Haig makes missteps, his press room performance is historically regrettable and he is \"difficult\". But there is nothing approaching the scenes depicted in the film. There are too many gross errors to list, but any fair comparison of the recorded and written record and the fantasy of this film begs the question as to what the producers were really trying to accomplish. Enlighten? Inform? Entertain? I believe they failed on all three fronts. It is difficult to ascribe motives to others, but one must seriously question what was behind such shameless invention. And, as for my beloved History Channel's \"Reel to Real\" follow-on documentary, there was almost no mention of the issues that were the central focus of the film -- namely the events within the Administration on the day of the shooting. So, the viewer was left to research those without much -- if any -- help from the network.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","film","on","the","histori","channel","todai","in","of","all","i","realiz","that","thi","be","not","a","documentari","that","it","be","a","drama","but","on","mai","hope","that","at","littl","the","critic","fact","that","the","stori","turn","on","mai","be","base","on","actual","event","reagan","be","shoot","and","the","other","charact","be","real","peopl","the","movi","get","that","right","from","there","on","relianc","on","fact","rapidli","decai","i","have","never","hear","of","thi","movi","befor","see","it","have","be","a","tv","report","at","the","time","of","thi","event","i","be","stun","that","i","have","never","hear","anyth","about","the","bizarr","behavior","of","secretari","haig","a","portrai","by","richard","dreyfuss","the","whole","nation","have","hear","the","i","be","in","control","etc","but","dreufuss","haig","be","bulli","a","cower","cabinet","and","total","out","of","control","person","have","watch","the","film","i","begin","research","the","subject","on","the","internet","and","quickli","find","actual","audio","tape","and","transcript","of","much","of","the","situat","room","convers","that","thi","film","pretend","to","reenact","incredibli","mani","the","the","princip","fact","of","the","film","mean","to","show","a","white","hous","secret","servic","etc","in","total","chao","and","the","nation","leadership","behav","irration","and","drive","the","world","near","the","brink","of","nuclear","war","be","demonstr","incorrect","thei","do","not","happen","there","be","intern","conflict","to","be","sure","haig","make","misstep","hi","press","room","perform","be","histor","regrett","and","he","be","difficult","but","there","be","noth","approach","the","scene","depict","in","the","film","there","be","too","mani","gross","error","to","list","but","ani","fair","comparison","of","the","record","and","write","record","and","the","fantasi","of","thi","film","beg","the","question","a","to","what","the","produc","be","realli","try","to","accomplish","enlighten","inform","entertain","i","believ","thei","fail","on","all","three","front","it","be","difficult","to","ascrib","motiv","to","other","but","on","must","serious","question","what","be","behind","such","shameless","invent","and","a","for","my","belov","histori","channel","reel","to","real","followon","documentari","there","be","almost","no","mention","of","the","issu","that","be","the","central","focu","of","the","film","name","the","event","within","the","administr","on","the","dai","of","the","shoot","so","the","viewer","be","leav","to","research","that","without","much","if","ani","help","from","the","network"],"filtered":["see","thi","film","histori","channel","todai","realiz","thi","documentari","drama","mai","hope","littl","critic","fact","stori","turn","mai","base","actual","event","reagan","shoot","charact","real","peopl","movi","get","right","relianc","fact","rapidli","decai","never","hear","thi","movi","befor","see","tv","report","time","thi","event","stun","never","hear","anyth","bizarr","behavior","secretari","haig","portrai","richard","dreyfuss","whole","nation","hear","control","etc","dreufuss","haig","bulli","cower","cabinet","total","control","person","watch","film","begin","research","subject","internet","quickli","find","actual","audio","tape","transcript","much","situat","room","convers","thi","film","pretend","reenact","incredibli","mani","princip","fact","film","mean","show","white","hous","secret","servic","etc","total","chao","nation","leadership","behav","irration","drive","world","near","brink","nuclear","war","demonstr","incorrect","thei","happen","intern","conflict","sure","haig","make","misstep","hi","press","room","perform","histor","regrett","difficult","noth","approach","scene","depict","film","mani","gross","error","list","ani","fair","comparison","record","write","record","fantasi","thi","film","beg","question","produc","realli","try","accomplish","enlighten","inform","entertain","believ","thei","fail","three","front","difficult","ascrib","motiv","must","serious","question","behind","shameless","invent","belov","histori","channel","reel","real","followon","documentari","almost","mention","issu","central","focu","film","name","event","within","administr","dai","shoot","viewer","leav","research","without","much","ani","help","network"],"filtered2":["see","histori","channel","todai","realiz","documentari","drama","mai","hope","littl","critic","fact","stori","turn","mai","base","actual","event","reagan","shoot","charact","real","peopl","get","right","relianc","fact","rapidli","decai","never","hear","befor","see","tv","report","time","event","stun","never","hear","anyth","bizarr","behavior","secretari","haig","portrai","richard","dreyfuss","whole","nation","hear","control","etc","dreufuss","haig","bulli","cower","cabinet","total","control","person","watch","begin","research","subject","internet","quickli","find","actual","audio","tape","transcript","situat","room","convers","pretend",

{"value":"60 minutes in the beautiful Christina Galbo tries to escape the isolated boarding school she's brought to at the beginning of the movie. Is she running from some kind of fate too horrible to contemplate, a monster, black-gloved killer, or supernatural evil? No, she's running from a bunch of bullies. For the OTHER 40 minutes that follow, various figures walk around the school in the dark holding candelabras and looking alarmed or distraught, which doesn't say much in itself perhaps because great movies have been made about just that but if you're going to have characters walking around corridors and staircases you better be Alain Resnais or you better know how to light that staircase in bright apple reds and purples like Mario Bava. We know a killer stalks the perimeters of the school but his body count is pitiful and sparse and in the absence of the visceral horrors one expects to find in the giallo, we get no sense of sinister mysteries/unspeakable secrets festering behind a facade of order and piety and rightness which is the kind of movie La Residencia wants to be but doesn't quite know how to do it. We know something is off because girls are reported missing but we never get the foreboding mysterious atmosphere that says \"something is seriously f-cking wrong here, man\". When Serrador tries to comment on the sexual repression of the female students, he does so with quick-cutting hysterics and detail closeups of eyes and parted lips while high pitched \"this-is-shocking\" music blares in the background. None of the aetherial beauty and longing of PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK to be found here. It's all a bit clumsy and aimless, with no real sense of urgency or direction. A number of people are presented as suspects but there's little reason to care for the identity of a killer that goes unnoticed by the characters inside the movie. I like the first kill, the image of a knife hitting target superimposed over the anguished face of the victim as a lullaby chimes in the background, but the rest is too inconsequential for my taste. I have to say Serrador did much better with the killing children and paranoia du soleil of WHO CAN KILL A CHILD?","finished_norm":["minut","in","the","beauti","christina","galbo","try","to","escap","the","isol","board","school","she","bring","to","at","the","begin","of","the","movi","be","she","run","from","some","kind","of","fate","too","horribl","to","contempl","a","monster","blackglov","killer","or","supernatur","evil","no","she","run","from","a","bunch","of","bulli","for","the","other","minut","that","follow","variou","figur","walk","around","the","school","in","the","dark","hold","candelabra","and","look","alarm","or","distraught","which","doe","not","sai","much","in","itself","perhap","becaus","great","movi","have","be","make","about","just","that","but","if","you","re","go","to","have","charact","walk","around","corridor","and","staircas","you","well","be","alain","resnai","or","you","well","know","how","to","light","that","staircas","in","bright","appl","red","and","purpl","like","mario","bava","we","know","a","killer","stalk","the","perimet","of","the","school","but","hi","bodi","count","be","piti","and","spars","and","in","the","absenc","of","the","viscer","horror","on","expect","to","find","in","the","giallo","we","get","no","sens","of","sinist","mysteriesunspeak","secret","fester","behind","a","facad","of","order","and","pieti","and","right","which","be","the","kind","of","movi","la","residencia","want","to","be","but","doe","not","quit","know","how","to","do","it","we","know","someth","be","off","becaus","girl","be","report","miss","but","we","never","get","the","forebod","mysteri","atmospher","that","sai","someth","be","serious","fcking","wrong","here","man","when","serrador","try","to","comment","on","the","sexual","repress","of","the","femal","student","he","doe","so","with","quickcut","hyster","and","detail","closeup","of","ey","and","part","lip","while","high","pitch","thisisshock","music","blare","in","the","background","none","of","the","aetheri","beauti","and","long","of","picnic","at","hang","rock","to","be","find","here","it","all","a","bite","clumsi","and","aimless","with","no","real","sens","of","urgenc","or","direct","a","numb","of","peopl","be","present","a","suspect","but","there","littl","reason","to","care","for","the","ident","of","a","killer","that","go","unnot","by","the","charact","insid","the","movi","i","like","the","kill","the","imag","of","a","knife","hit","target","superimpos","over","the","anguish","face","of","the","victim","a","a","lullabi","chime","in","the","background","but","the","rest","be","too","inconsequenti","for","my","tast","i","have","to","sai","serrador","do","much","well","with","the","kill","child","and","paranoia","du","soleil","of","who","can","kill","a","child"],"filtered":["minut","beauti","christina","galbo","try","escap","isol","board","school","bring","begin","movi","run","kind","fate","horribl","contempl","monster","blackglov","killer","supernatur","evil","run","bunch","bulli","minut","follow","variou","figur","walk","around","school","dark","hold","candelabra","look","alarm","distraught","doe","sai","much","perhap","becaus","great","movi","make","re","go","charact","walk","around","corridor","staircas","well","alain","resnai","well","know","light","staircas","bright","appl","red","purpl","like","mario","bava","know","killer","stalk","perimet","school","hi","bodi","count","piti","spars","absenc","viscer","horror","expect","find","giallo","get","sens","sinist","mysteriesunspeak","secret","fester","behind","facad","order","pieti","right","kind","movi","la","residencia","want","doe","quit","know","know","someth","becaus","girl","report","miss","never","get","forebod","mysteri","atmospher","sai","someth","serious","fcking","wrong","man","serrador","try","comment","sexual","repress","femal","student","doe","quickcut","hyster","detail","closeup","ey","part","lip","high","pitch","thisisshock","music","blare","background","none","aetheri","beauti","long","picnic","hang","rock","find","bite","clumsi","aimless","real","sens","urgenc","direct","numb","peopl","present","suspect","littl","reason","care","ident","killer","go","unnot","charact","insid","movi","like","kill","imag","knife","hit","target","superimpos","anguish","face","victim","lullabi","chime","background","rest","inconsequenti","tast","sai","serrador","much","well","kill","child","paranoia","du","soleil","kill","child"],"filtered2":["minut","beauti","christina","galbo","try","escap","isol","board","school","bring","begin","run","kind","fate","horribl","contempl","monster","blackglov","killer","supernatur","evil","run","bunch","bulli","minut","follow","variou","figur","walk","around","school","dark","hold","candelabra","look","alarm","distraught","doe","perhap","becaus","great","make","re","go","charact","walk","around","corridor","staircas","well","alain","resnai","well","know","light","staircas","bright","appl","red","purpl","like","mario","bava","know","killer","stalk","perimet","school","bodi","count","piti","spars","absenc","viscer","horror","expect","find","giallo","get","sens","sinist","mys

{"value":"I was very disappointed by this film for a few reasons. For the first half hour it's actually pretty decent. Although the acting isn't any better then that which you would find in a rap video, its kinda funny and the production value doesn't seem half bad. In fact I almost thought this would be almost as good as Perico Ripiao (another recent Dominican film) which turned out to be MUCH MUCH better than I expected. The plot for the movie revolves around not just cheating husbands but how women are viewed and treated in Dominican society as a whole, which makes for a good premise especially in The Dominican Republic. Unfortunately I don't think the makers of this film relies that a good movie is all about how you treat your subject matter, and they f'ing butchered the veal cutlet they had before them. About 30 minutes into the movie the roles of men and women are reversed after the main characters wife puts a kind of spell on him as a result of his cheating habits. Not only does this transition happen via what look to be cutting edge, space age, CGI effects dating to what I'm guessing would be the 70's, but the whole plot just goes down the drain. The rest of the movie is nothing but cheesy predictable situations, and clever one liners. To top it all off (and I guess I should warn you now **SPOILER ALERT**) it all turns out to be a dream. Oh my who didn't see that coming? Oh man I almost forgot the most ridiculous thing about the movie. Well after about an hour into it I start thinking \"hmmmm something just doesn't seem right about the sound track but what can it be??\" and then it hits me HALF OF THE MUSIC IN THE MOVIE WAS TAKEN FROM A VIDEO GAME CALLED KING OF FIGHTER 95.<br /><br />When oh when DR will you give us a film we can call a work of art?!?! Perhaps a comedy to match France's Amelie, or an action flick to match Thailand's Ong-Bak, an animation as Akira was to Japan, a witty crime thriller as Layer Cake was to England, or a socio-awakening journey as Waking Life had here in the states.<br /><br />...i would give it a 1 but i've seen much worse come out of DR, search Los Jodedores and you'll know what I'm talking about.","finished_norm":["i","be","veri","disappoint","by","thi","film","for","a","few","reason","for","the","half","hour","it","actual","pretti","decent","although","the","act","be","not","ani","well","then","that","which","you","would","find","in","a","rap","video","it","kinda","funni","and","the","product","valu","doe","not","seem","half","bad","in","fact","i","almost","think","thi","would","be","almost","a","good","a","perico","ripiao","anoth","recent","dominican","film","which","turn","out","to","be","much","much","well","than","i","expect","the","plot","for","the","movi","revolv","around","not","just","cheat","husband","but","how","woman","be","view","and","treat","in","dominican","societi","a","a","whole","which","make","for","a","good","premis","especi","in","the","dominican","republ","unfortun","i","do","not","think","the","maker","of","thi","film","reli","that","a","good","movi","be","all","about","how","you","treat","your","subject","matt","and","thei","f","ing","butcher","the","veal","cutlet","thei","have","befor","them","about","minut","into","the","movi","the","role","of","man","and","woman","be","revers","after","the","main","charact","wife","put","a","kind","of","spell","on","him","a","a","result","of","hi","cheat","habit","not","onli","doe","thi","transit","happen","via","what","look","to","be","cut","edg","space","ag","cgi","effect","date","to","what","i","be","guess","would","be","the","but","the","whole","plot","just","go","down","the","drain","the","rest","of","the","movi","be","noth","but","cheesi","predict","situat","and","clever","on","liner","to","top","it","all","off","and","i","guess","i","should","warn","you","now","spoiler","alert","it","all","turn","out","to","be","a","dream","oh","my","who","do","not","see","that","come","oh","man","i","almost","forget","the","much","ridicul","thing","about","the","movi","good","after","about","a","hour","into","it","i","start","think","hmmmm","someth","just","doe","not","seem","right","about","the","sound","track","but","what","can","it","be","and","then","it","hit","me","half","of","the","music","in","the","movi","be","take","from","a","video","game","call","king","of","fighter","br","br","when","oh","when","dr","will","you","give","u","a","film","we","can","call","a","work","of","art","perhap","a","comedi","to","match","franc","ameli","or","a","action","flick","to","match","thailand","ongbak","a","anim","a","akira","be","to","japan","a","witti","crime","thriller","a","layer","cake","be","to","england","or","a","socioawaken","journei","a","wake","life","have","here","in","the","statesbr","br","i","would","give","it","a","but","i","have","see","much","wrong","come","out","of","dr","search","lo","jodedor","and","you","will","know","what","i","be","talk","about"],"filtered":["veri","disappoint","thi","film","reason","half","hour","actual","pretti","decent","although","act","ani","well","find","rap","video","kinda","funni","product","valu","doe","seem","half","bad","fact","almost","think","thi","almost","good","perico","ripiao","anoth","recent","dominican","film","turn","much","much","well","expect","plot","movi","revolv","around","cheat","husband","woman","view","treat","dominican","societi","whole","make","good","premis","especi","dominican","republ","unfortun","think","maker","thi","film","reli","good","movi","treat","subject","matt","thei","f","ing","butcher","veal","cutlet","thei","befor","minut","movi","role","man","woman","revers","main","charact","wife","put","kind","spell","result","hi","cheat","habit","onli","doe","thi","transit","happen","via","look","cut","edg","space","ag","cgi","effect","date","guess","whole","plot","go","drain","rest","movi","noth","cheesi","predict","situat","clever","liner","top","guess","warn","spoiler","alert","turn","dream","oh","see","come","oh","man","almost","forget","much","ridicul","thing","movi","good","hour","start","think","hmmmm","someth","doe","seem","right","sound","track","hit","half","music","movi","take","video","game","call","king","fighter","br","br","oh","dr","give","u","film","call","work","art","perhap","comedi","match","franc","ameli","action","flick","match","thailand","ongbak","anim","akira","japan","witti","crime","thriller","layer","cake","england","socioawaken","journei","wake","life","statesbr","br","give","see","much","wrong","come","dr","search","lo","jodedor","know","talk"],"filtered2":["veri","disappoint","reason","half","hour","actual","pretti","decent","although","act","ani","well","find","rap","video","kinda","funni","product","valu","doe","seem","half","bad","fact","almost","think","almost","good","perico","ripiao","anoth","recent","dominican","turn","well","expect","plot","revolv","around","cheat","husband","woman","view","treat","dominican","societi","whole","make","good","premis","especi","dominican","republ","unfortun","think","maker","reli","good","treat","subject","matt","f","ing","butcher","veal","cutlet","befor","minut","role","man","woman","revers","main","charact","

And now it's EUROPA 51, another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment.<br /><br />Nor does the story do much for Alexander KNOX, in another thankless role as her long-suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son. At least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than STROMBOLI.<br /><br />Bergman is still attractive here, but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman. She's never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son, despite attempts by a kindly male friend. \"Sometimes I think I'm going out of my mind,\" she tells her husband. A portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace, but it does give us a sense of where the story is going.<br /><br />Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post-war Rome, but being a social worker with poor children doesn't improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse.<br /><br />The film's overall effect is that it's not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like Bergman. The film loses pace midway through the story as Bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she's two-timing him. The story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street-walker through her terminal illness. The final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum.<br /><br />Ingrid suffers nobly through it all (over-compensating for the loss of her son) but it's no use. Not one of her best flicks, to put it mildly.<br /><br />Trivia note: If she wanted neo-realism with mental illness, she might have been better off accepting the lead in THE SNAKE PIT when it was offered to her by director Anatole Litvak!! It would have done more for her career than EUROPA 51.<br /><br />Summing up: Another bleak indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman.","finished_norm":["poor","ingrid","suffer","and","suffer","onc","she","go","off","to","itali","tire","of","the","hollywood","glamor","treatment","it","be","suffer","the","torment","of","a","volcan","island","in","stromboli","a","arti","failur","that","would","have","kill","the","career","of","a","littl","resili","actress","and","now","it","europa","anoth","tediou","exercis","in","soggi","sentimentbr","br","nor","doe","the","stori","do","much","for","alexand","knox","in","anoth","thankless","role","a","her","longsuff","husband","who","try","to","comfort","her","after","the","suicid","death","of","their","young","son","at","littl","thi","on","have","well","product","valu","and","a","much","coher","script","than","strombolibr","br","bergman","be","still","attract","here","but","move","toward","a","much","matronli","appear","a","a","rich","societi","woman","she","never","abl","to","cope","over","the","sudden","loss","of","her","son","despit","attempt","by","a","kindli","male","friend","sometim","i","think","i","be","go","out","of","my","mind","she","tell","her","husband","a","portent","statem","in","a","film","that","be","total","without","humor","or","grace","but","it","doe","give","u","a","sens","of","where","the","stori","be","goingbr","br","bergman","be","soon","motiv","to","help","the","poor","in","postwar","rome","but","be","a","social","worker","with","poor","child","doe","not","improv","her","emot","health","and","from","thereon","the","plot","take","a","turn","for","the","worsebr","br","the","film","overal","effect","be","that","it","not","suffici","interest","to","make","into","a","project","for","a","major","star","like","bergman","the","film","lose","pace","midwai","through","the","stori","a","bergman","becom","much","and","much","distraught","and","her","husband","suspect","that","she","twotim","him","the","stori","go","downhil","from","there","after","she","nurs","a","streetwalk","through","her","termin","ill","the","final","thread","of","plot","have","her","husband","ne","to","place","her","for","observ","in","a","mental","asylumbr","br","ingrid","suffer","nobli","through","it","all","overcompens","for","the","loss","of","her","son","but","it","no","us","not","on","of","her","well","flick","to","put","it","mildlybr","br","trivium","note","if","she","want","neoreal","with","mental","ill","she","mai","have","be","well","off","accept","the","lead","in","the","snake","pit","when","it","be","offer","to","her","by","director","anatol","litvak","it","would","have","do","much","for","her","career","than","europa","br","br","sum","up","anoth","bleak","indiscret","of","rossellini","and","bergman"],"filtered":["poor","ingrid","suffer","suffer","onc","go","itali","tire","hollywood","glamor","treatment","suffer","torment","volcan","island","stromboli","arti","failur","kill","career","littl","resili","actress","europa","anoth","tediou","exercis","soggi","sentimentbr","br","doe","stori","much","alexand","knox","anoth","thankless","role","longsuff","husband","try","comfort","suicid","death","young","son","littl","thi","well","product","valu","much","coher","script","strombolibr","br","bergman","still","attract","move","toward","much","matronli","appear","rich","societi","woman","never","abl","cope","sudden","loss","son","despit","attempt","kindli","male","friend","sometim","think","go","mind","tell","husband","portent","statem","film","total","without","humor","grace","doe","give","u","sens","stori","goingbr","br","bergman","soon","motiv","help","poor","postwar","rome","social","worker","poor","child","doe","improv","emot","health","thereon","plot","take","turn","worsebr","br","film","overal","effect","suffici","interest","make","project","major","star","like","bergman","film","lose","pace","midwai","stori","bergman","becom","much","much","distraught","husband","suspect","twotim","stori","go","downhil","nurs","streetwalk","termin","ill","final","thread","plot","husband","ne","place","observ","mental","asylumbr","br","ingrid","suffer","nobli","overcompens","loss","son","us","well","flick","put","mildlybr","br","trivium","note","want","neoreal","mental","ill","mai","well","accept","lead","snake","pit","offer","director","anatol","litvak","much","career","europa","br","br","sum","anoth","bleak","indiscret","rossellini","bergman"],"filtered2":["poor","ingrid","suffer","suffer","onc","go","itali","tire","hollywood","glamor","treatment","suffer","torment","volcan","island","stromboli","arti","failur","kill","career","littl","resili","actress","europa","anoth","tediou","exercis","soggi","sentimentbr","doe","stori","alexand","knox","anoth","thankless","role","longsuff","husband","try","comfort","suicid","death","young","son","littl","well","product","valu","coher","script","strombolibr","bergman","still","attract","move","toward","matronli","appear","rich","societi","woman","never","abl","cope","sudden","loss","son","despit","attempt","kindli","male","friend","sometim","think","go","mind","tell","husband","port

{"value":"I must admit that I have been a sucker for Samurai flicks since I can remember. I used to watch rather indiscriminate, be it \"elitist\" works like The Seven Samurai or the bloody comic-book variation like Lone Wolf and Cub. I also liked US-/Japanese \"Crossovers\" like The Bushido Blade. And of course everything containing Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada. And I've virtually watched every Samurai at least twice. But not Kabuto.<br /><br />In 1993 I first watched Kabuto on video, that even Samurai films can be boring. In the beginning I was looking forward to Mayeda reaching Europe and the confrontations that would come from that but by the time he actually reached Spain, I really didn't care so much for the movie anymore.<br /><br />It wouldn't do the film justice to call it \"bad\". Technically it's a clean entry into the genre. But there is simply never quiet enough. Sho Kosugi has limited skills as both director and actor and has only a fraction of above mentioned Japanese actors charisma. And speaking of Sho Kosugis son Kane, who appears in almost all Sho Kosugi films as Shos son: he has inherited little-to-none of his fathers limited acting skills. Adding to the minus-points is the absence of the blood and gore that until then was a trademark of all Samurai film. This was obviously intended for a younger US- / European audience.<br /><br />Lets just say that it's a so-so film for the average historic-action-adventure fan but a bore for hardened fans of Samurai cinema. Fans who are into the \"Samurai meets \"-genre, should rather go and watch Red Sun (1971), featuring Charles Bronson as cowboy who has to team up with Samurai Toshiro Mifume to retrieve a samurai sword from bad-guy Alan Delon. It pretty much how to do it right and where Kabuto went wrong.<br /><br />So, even though the film is a mere 100 minutes, it seems like a much longer film.<br /><br />The reason I gave this a honourable 4/10 points instead of 3/10: First time I saw this film, I saw it in the German synchronized version. In this version, Kosugi can actually be understood. I must admit that his 'Engrish' is at times funny but gets tiresome after about 30 minutes.","finished_norm":["i","must","admit","that","i","have","be","a","sucker","for","samurai","flick","sinc","i","can","rememb","i","us","to","watch","rather","indiscrimin","be","it","elitist","work","like","the","seven","samurai","or","the","bloodi","comicbook","variat","like","lone","wolf","and","cub","i","conjur","like","usjapanes","crossov","like","the","bushido","blade","and","of","cours","everyth","contain","sonni","chiba","and","hiroyuki","sanada","and","i","have","virtual","watch","everi","samurai","at","littl","twice","but","not","kabutobr","br","in","i","watch","kabuto","on","video","that","even","samurai","film","can","be","bore","in","the","begin","i","be","look","forward","to","mayeda","reach","europ","and","the","confront","that","would","come","from","that","but","by","the","time","he","actual","reach","spain","i","realli","do","not","care","so","much","for","the","movi","anymorebr","br","it","would","not","do","the","film","justic","to","call","it","bad","technic","it","a","clean","entri","into","the","genr","but","there","be","simpli","never","quiet","enough","sho","kosugi","have","limit","skill","a","both","director","and","actor","and","have","onli","a","fraction","of","abov","mention","japanes","actor","charisma","and","speak","of","sho","kosugi","son","kane","who","appear","in","almost","all","sho","kosugi","film","a","sho","son","he","have","inherit","littletonon","of","hi","father","limit","act","skill","add","to","the","minuspoint","be","the","absenc","of","the","blood","and","gore","that","until","then","be","a","trademark","of","all","samurai","film","thi","be","obvious","intend","for","a","young","u","european","audiencebr","br","let","just","sai","that","it","a","soso","film","for","the","averag","historicactionadventur","fan","but","a","bear","for","harden","fan","of","samurai","cinema","fan","who","be","into","the","samurai","meet","genr","should","rather","go","and","watch","red","sun","featur","charl","bronson","a","cowboi","who","have","to","team","up","with","samurai","toshiro","mifum","to","retriev","a","samurai","sword","from","badgui","alan","delon","it","pretti","much","how","to","do","it","right","and","where","kabuto","go","wrongbr","br","so","even","though","the","film","be","a","mere","minut","it","seem","like","a","much","long","filmbr","br","the","reason","i","give","thi","a","honour","point","instead","of","time","i","see","thi","film","i","see","it","in","the","german","synchron","version","in","thi","version","kosugi","can","actual","be","understand","i","must","admit","that","hi","engrish","be","at","time","funni","but","get","tiresom","after","about","minut"],"filtered":["must","admit","sucker","samurai","flick","sinc","rememb","us","watch","rather","indiscrimin","elitist","work","like","seven","samurai","bloodi","comicbook","variat","like","lone","wolf","cub","conjur","like","usjapanes","crossov","like","bushido","blade","cours","everyth","contain","sonni","chiba","hiroyuki","sanada","virtual","watch","everi","samurai","littl","twice","kabutobr","br","watch","kabuto","video","even","samurai","film","bore","begin","look","forward","mayeda","reach","europ","confront","come","time","actual","reach","spain","realli","care","much","movi","anymorebr","br","film","justic","call","bad","technic","clean","entri","genr","simpli","never","quiet","enough","sho","kosugi","limit","skill","director","actor","onli","fraction","abov","mention","japanes","actor","charisma","speak","sho","kosugi","son","kane","appear","almost","sho","kosugi","film","sho","son","inherit","littletonon","hi","father","limit","act","skill","add","minuspoint","absenc","blood","gore","trademark","samurai","film","thi","obvious","intend","young","u","european","audiencebr","br","let","sai","soso","film","averag","historicactionadventur","fan","bear","harden","fan","samurai","cinema","fan","samurai","meet","genr","rather","go","watch","red","sun","featur","charl","bronson","cowboi","team","samurai","toshiro","mifum","retriev","samurai","sword","badgui","alan","delon","pretti","much","right","kabuto","go","wrongbr","br","even","though","film","mere","minut","seem","like","much","long","filmbr","br","reason","give","thi","honour","point","instead","time","see","thi","film","see","german","synchron","version","thi","version","kosugi","actual","understand","must","admit","hi","engrish","time","funni","get","tiresom","minut"],"filtered2":["must","admit","sucker","samurai","flick","sinc","rememb","us","watch","rather","indiscrimin","elitist","work","like","seven","samurai","bloodi","comicbook","variat","like","lone","wolf","cub","conjur","like","usjapanes","crossov","like","bushido","blade","cours","everyth","contain","sonni","chiba","hiroyuki","sanada","virtual","watch","everi","samurai","littl","twice","kabutobr","watch","kabuto","video","even","samurai","bore","begin","look","forward","mayeda","reach","europ","confront","come","time","actual","reach","spain","realli","care","anymorebr","justic","call

{"value":"I'm grateful for one thing and one thing only - that this woman will now be thousands of miles away on an entirely different continent!!! Yay!!! This programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed Victoria Beckham has become with whoring herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and 'Brand f*cking Beckham'.<br /><br />A few years ago I used to really like 'Posh and Becks', I still very much admire David's talent, but I have no respect for him anymore. How can you respect someone who has his wife's hand shoved up his backside working him like a puppet.<br /><br />It was clear the hand of Victoria was all over Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing has happened at Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that although he may be earning squillions of pounds - he's sold his soul for the American Buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from Division One in England (no offence America - but at Baseball and Basketball you rule - football you don't!) <br /><br />Anyway - I digress. It's been years since I've seen such an over-the-top, entirely false performance from 'Posh' - this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the Rebecca Loos 'debacle', when instead of throwing all the cr*p at David he deserved, she desperately clung onto his arm trying to save the million pound money-spinner her marriage has become.<br /><br />This whole PR stunt was pathetic. Why can't she just go over there quietly, support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down? When did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to America should be shrouded by this huge fan fare? <br /><br />Incidentally, I saw the David Beckham documentary last night. At least he has retained a sliver of grace and humility. Two things his wife could do with learning.<br /><br />One more thing Victoria - you complain about constantly being hounded by the paps. Little hint - stop tipping them off about your whereabouts you stupid woman.<br /><br />Good Luck

{"value":"I have been a fervent Hal Hartley supporter since I saw his short \"Surviving Desire\" in high school, and even then was still completely unmoored by his searingly brilliant \"Henry Fool.\" But this 10-year-later sequel is not only unnecessary, it's disgraceful.<br /><br />After a choppy and expeditious start, \"Fay Grim\" devolves into pseudo-intellectualism, flat out boredom, and finally unwarranted - and unwanted - nihilism. And that's just the plot.<br /><br />The majority of the new faces are as frivolous and poorly-developed as the movie: one particularly flat character ends up hogging half the time we spend with the infamous Henry Fool himself, and it's his only spoken scene in the film!<br /><br />Jeff Goldblum's Agent Fulbright, it seems, is the only bright character (a pun surely intended by Hartley as well). How, then, is he left? **SPOILER** Dead via a car bombing, easily making this the gentle-natured Hartley's most violent film to date, and tonally all wrong in a film that's already all wrong from the word go.<br /><br />As for the other new characters, Angus James, Ned Fool (or is it Grim?), not to mention Fay herself... well, I won't spoil their fates, as the movie does a good enough job of that all on its own (when it isn't busying itself with yet another godawful canted angle, which gives the disconcerting impression that Hartley is moving backwards from Auteur to crappy film student).<br /><br />This piece is a complete disaster, a dreadful mess that isn't even good-humored enough to revel in its messiness. Instead it self-indulgently crams the typically fun hipster pretenses of its director into the \"real world\", one uglier and meaner than it need be but not nearly ugly or mean enough to come close to having anything to say. In doing so, Hartley tracks sh*t all over my memories of these people and the marvelous world he originally created for them.<br /><br />I have rarely been so depressed at the movies, and I'm counting \"Leaving Las Vegas,\" which at least developed fresh new characters we grew to love before destroying them, instead of immediately disregarding characters already beloved.<br /><br />Grim,

{"value":"Snow White, which just came out in Locarno, where I had the chance to see it, of course refers to the world famous fairy tale. And it also refers to coke. In the end, real snow of the Swiss Alps plays its part as well.<br /><br />Thus all three aspects of the title are addressed in this film. There is a lot of dope on scene, and there is also a pale, dark haired girl - with a prince who has to go through all kind of trouble to come to her rescue.<br /><br />But: It's not a fairy tale. It's supposed to be a realistic drama located in Zurich, Switzerland (according to the Tagline).<br /><br />Technically the movie is close to perfect. Unfortunately a weak plot, foreseeable dialogs, a mostly unreal scenery and the mixed acting don't add up to create authenticity. Thus as a spectator I remained untouched.<br /><br />And then there were the clichés, which drove me crazy one by one: Snow White is a rich and spoiled upper class daughter - of course her parents are divorced and she never got enough love from them, because they were so busy all the time. Her best girlfriend, on the other hand, has loving and caring parents. They (a steelworker and a housewife) live in a tiny flat, poor and happy - and ignorant of the desperate situation their daughter is in. The good guy (= prince) is a musician (!) from the French speaking part of Switzerland (which is considered to be the economically less successful but emotionally fitter fraction of the country). He has problems with his parents. They are migrants from Spain, who don't seem to accept his wild way of living - until the father becomes seriously ill and confesses his great admiration for his son from a hospital bed.<br /><br />And so it goes on: Naturally, the drug dealer is brutal, the bankers are heartless, the club owner is a playboy and the photographer, although a woman (!), has only her career in mind when she exposes Snow White in artsy pornographic pictures at a show.<br /><br />This review doesn't need a spoiler in order to let you add these pieces to an obvious plot. As I like other films by Samir, e.g. \"Forget Baghdad\", I was quite disappointed. Let's hope for the next

{"value":"MONSTER - He was great; I loved the special-effects which created this monster which looked like an updated version of \"The Creature From the Black Lagoon.\" The scenes with this beast roaming the land and capturing people ranged from good to jaw-dropping.<br /><br />SOCIAL COMMENTARY: Much of the story takes place in the quarantine area as the doctors (under orders from the government) state that SARS-like disease is out there. In a nutshell, we get the familiar government cover-up story. You know, I expect this Liberal paranoid mindset with Hollywood films always painting our government as corrupt, but it looks like the Koreans are copying the format, and it's very tedious. In here, it takes away from the excitement and suspense of this \"monster.\" It just drags the film down. The main family featured in the film has to watch from a distance while the young girl in their family, presumed dead, was hauled off by the creature.<br /><br />MORAL: A typical \"don't pollute the water\" message because this is what can happen - a horrible mutated monster. This used to be the anti-nuclear bomb message from the 1950 when radiation caused giants ants, spiders, fish or whatever in those schlocky sci-fi films. Now its \"environmental issues\" that are the focus.<br /><br />THE HUMOR This was mostly stupid. I normally laugh at slapstick but this wasn't funny. I don't know if the Korean sense of humor is that pitiful, or the film was purposely trying to be ultra-corny with a take on the old \"Godzilla\" movies. Let's hope it's the latter.<br /><br />TRANSFER - The video transfer was good. This was a sharp-looking picture and sound was decent with a lot rear-speaker crowd noise. I watched this in Korean with the English subtitles. That might have been a mistake as the Korean guttural voice sounds got annoying after a half hour.<br /><br />OVERALL - This had a promise but turned out to be a big letdown and even boring in too many spots, which is inexcusable for a modern-day monster film. Two hours was WAY too long for this story. How this film drew record crowds in Korea I don't know. They must not have much in the way of films to enjoy and

{"value":"I went into this movie with high hopes. Normally, I'm not too picky about my movies and creature movies are *always* fun to watch, or so I thought. I'll list the good parts of this movie: -The creature effects. All of the creatures were well-done, their movements were realistic, and they fit into the other imagery well. To be honest, the creature effects were the ONLY reason I gave this movie a 2 rather than a 1. Now, the bad things: -The acting. Good Lord, I've seen bad acting, but this movie takes the cake. Not a single one of the characters is even *close* to believable. It's like the director sent out a casting call and picked all the worst try-outs from it. I tried very hard not to giggle too loud, cause I didn't wanna upset anyone else in the theatre, but the acting really was THAT BAD. -The storyline: The entire story is full of plot holes from beginning to finish. You can pick at least 5 plot holes out of any given 30 minutes of film. The plot holes, of course, are complimentary with the cheese. This is probably one of the most clichéd, not thought-out, and outright dumbest stories I've ever seen put on screen since I had the grave misfortune of sitting up one night and watching Parasite on the SciFi channel. -The dialogue: This is a world where everyone says the cheesiest and most clichéd thing they possibly can, at every chance they possibly can. In this world, it seems like every line has been spoken before in at least 30 other low-budget creature movies. It is the world of cheese and cliché. -The special effects. While the creature effects were downright awesome, the special effects fail miserably. Yes, they are better than those seen in other movies, but a lot of it is in the presentation. And this movie has no presentation whatsoever. It looks kinda like the special effects used on the Power Rangers TV show, to be honest. To sum up: Dragon Wars is worth neither your time nor your money. The concept is good, but it is trapped in the bad directing, acting, dialogue, and cheesiness of the film. Wait til the next big monster movie comes out.

{"value":"While I can't deny that his movies are often entertaining, I have always personally felt that Martin Scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities. His use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream \"Look at me, aren't I an imaginative director?\". His best film that I have seen is the one with the least added flourishes, the superlative \"Raging Bull\".<br /><br />For this remake it appears it was business as usual, though. The dull film stock to convey a 1950's setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself. The melodramatic close-ups combined with the sub-par imitation of the classic \"Psycho\" score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror. The score for \"Psycho\" was brilliantly unnerving, this 'homage' just sounds shrill and annoying. Even the cast, who can be decent at times, deliver histrionic performances that just scream 'caricature'; the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by Lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the Bowden family.<br /><br />The worst acting offender here is surprisingly De Niro. Sure, he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away. Now I'm no expert on American accents, me originally coming from near Manchester in England an' all, but surely he could've come up with a more convincing Southern drawl than that? Being the gifted physical actor he is, he almost overcomes this fatal flaw, but not quite. It was disconcerting for me, as a De Niro fan, to be wishing he was off screen, rather than rapt at his performance.<br /><br />(POSSIBLE SPOILERS.)<br /><br />The over-the-top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale. When will Scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment? I also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the 'killer-not-dead-yet' cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ.<br /><br />All in all, a thoroughly ridiculous 'thriller'.

There is so much 'intrigue' (and I use that word with great pause) that I wonder if it's an old Starsky & Hutch episode. I lost count of the number of times I noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar. Refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid-60's (ludicrous) the producers simply replace Marilyn & Eddie with younger actors. Why not let them grow and age? The addition of an Addam's Family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the Halloween Party.<br /><br />Grandpa & Herman fly to Transylvania and back in a few hours (preposterous.) Sid Ceaser is the most, yes the most unbelievable character (I am including the bad robots) since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish & yiddish but claims to be an ancient Arabic ruler. And yes, it looks like the laugh track is missing. In fact, there are several spots where there is dead air, as if the laugh track was to be inserted later. The actors seem to wait on the faux audience. It's not laughable; it's sad. Oh, and the best part! Yvonne DeCarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were. Marilyn says something like: \"Where could Uncle Herman and Grandpa be? They could have been in an accident. They could have been hit by a car...or a train!\" Lily says responds with something like: \"You're Uncle Herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track.\" What's amazing about this is: Yvonne DeCarlo's husband was a stuntman in the early 60's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt. He never recovered and this financially devastated her family. (check out Biography's fantastic review of her life and career) This line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her.<br /><br />If you are a real fan of the Munster's then you'll have to RENT this mess. It illustrates how some things are better left alone. Even with the (nearly) original cast, this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years

{"value":"This sure is one comedy I'm not likely to forget for a while.<br /><br />Wouldn't normally bother to comment on this movie: it's so minor that no one would watch it anyway, but as it happens, it's kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as Kazaa, and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is.<br /><br />So what is it then? Well, of course it's not really a comedy; instead, it's intended as a horror flick -- \"intended\" very much being the key word here. The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess, the special effects are only special in that they're especially pathetic, and as for the acting, well, let's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school, my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent.<br /><br />Of course I realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations, certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned. Also, even though I'm a big fan of the horror genre, I'm aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting.<br /><br />But still.<br /><br />B-movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding, such as humour. The only laughs in Cradle to Fear lie in the ridiculous performances. If you can find the humour in that--and I could for the first 20 minutes or so, gradually dozing off after that--then that's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer. Oh, that and two or three pairs of breasts.<br /><br />Woohoo, how exciting.<br /><br />As for the story, it's not even that it doesn't try to convey anything: the victims either use drugs and/or are involved in serious crime. The lesson: Watch out, naughty boys and girls, because one day you'll be made to pay for what you've done.<br /><br />I rest my case.<br /><br />So, all in all, a little bit of sex, a fair amount of drugs, but absolutely zero rock 'n roll.<br /><br />I rate this one 1 out of 10, but would go to 0 if I could. Or perhaps I wouldn't: it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors' names correctly in the titles. I mean, that's something,

{"value":"Oh my... bad clothing, worse synth music and the worst: David Hasselhoff. The 80's are back with vengeance in Witchery, an American-Italian co-production, helmed by infamous Joe 'D'Amato on the production side and short-careered director (thank heavens for small miracles) Fabrizio Laurenti directing . Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (that was dubbed \"La Casa\" in there), Witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting.<br /><br />A mix of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups slow it's progress to expectable ending, topped with some serious WTF surprise climax. (I just love the look on her face...) Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes; unluckily for him, these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively.<br /><br />The plus sides are experienced, when the gore hits the fan. This department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80's Italo-gore, when things were made 100% hand-made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow. I could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over-the-top ways that obnoxious characters (and actors) got mangled and misused, one by one. I only felt sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career, or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.<br /><br />Well, folks - not much more to tell, and even less to tell home about.

{"value":"COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS.....I'm surprised by the high rating of this film to be honest..really am. All I saw was a slow moving propaganda movie with nothing much to say. (Note to self must check the rating for Platoon on here)This movie was so black and white...Americans good...anyone else either evil or useless. I take it the British troops in it were meant to be SAS (one of the most elite units in the world most would agree with I'm pretty sure) they lost 3 men and the others ran away while the US troops who weren't even Elite soldiers in the fighting sense held the ground and opened up a can of whoop ass on them evil sneaky Iraqis. Aye dead-on strings to mind. The only good thing I have to say about this movie did come in this sense when the sniper took out the SAS man...muzzle flash from distance, good noise used...really well done that bit but the rest...Spare me what am I 10 years of age over here??!! Well I'm not and can see nonsense propaganda in a movie and boy did this movie have it.<br /><br />SPOILER...Oh aye and in the main crazy,wild guy can't stay at home with his wife and young child..no he has to sign up for another year to fight in a nonsense lie of a war!! Why...because young men need thrills or something apparently. Like say I'm surprised by the high rating of this movie really am.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not hating America I'm hating the message of this movie that seems to not even want to confront issues of an illegal war (in my eyes) which OK fair enough because clearly there are people out there who think it's a just war for whatever messed up reason (wanted to say something else her but censored) but hey that's up to them. But to churn out a movie so one-sided like it's black and white...good v evil is lazy and treating me as a child. In war there is a lot of grey and it's two (sometimes more)sides who believe in what they are fighting for. Not Star Wars with something something dark side verses the goodies.

{"value":"VAMPYRES <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />A motorist (Murray Brown) is lured to an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women (Marianne Morris and Anulka) and becomes enmeshed in their free-spirited sexual lifestyle, but his hosts turn out to be vampires with a frenzied lust for human blood...<br /><br />Taking its cue from the lesbian vampire cycle initiated by maverick director Jean Rollin in France, and consolidated by the success of Hammer's \"Carmilla\" series in the UK, Jose Ramon Larraz' daring shocker VAMPYRES pushed the concept of Adult Horror much further than British censors were prepared to tolerate in 1974, and his film was cut by almost three minutes on its original British release. It isn't difficult to see why! Using its Gothic theme as the pretext for as much nudity, sex and bloodshed as the film's short running time will allow, Larraz (who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym 'D. Daubeney') uses these commercial elements as mere backdrop to a languid meditation on life, death and the impulses - sexual and otherwise - which affirm the human condition.<br /><br />Shot on location at a picturesque country house during the Autumn of 1973, Harry Waxman's haunting cinematography conjures an atmosphere of grim foreboding, in which the desolate countryside - bleak and beautiful in equal measure - seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror (Larraz pulled a similar trick earlier the same year with SYMPTOMS, a low-key thriller which erupts into a frenzy of violence during the final reel). However, despite its pretensions, VAMPYRES' wafer-thin plot and rough-hewn production values will divide audiences from the outset, and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and appealing as could be wished, the male lead (Brown, past his prime at the time of filming) is woefully miscast in a role that should have gone to some beautiful twentysomething stud.

{"value":"It is a real shame that nearly no one under 30 knows the \"over the top\" writing of Michael O'Donoghugh- magazine articles and SNL skits that were genius for the time...and so it is a true shame that anyone who may take the opportunity to research his work will no doubt take the easy way out and watch videos- thus leading them to MR MIKES MONDO VIDEO. <br /><br />This movie has clever elements that never fully connect to the funny bone. The viewer experiences such things as cat diving/swimming with the man who thinks he's found feline happiness by hurling these kittens into a pool which the camera follows in slow motion and montage sequence. Then we are taken to an island to where all past fads are retired (hula hops, pet rocks, rainbow dread wigs etc.) Then we enter the music world (punk was a new variety of music at the time of this film) where \"D\" rate bar performer Rootboy Slim performs \"boogie till you puke\" in his own lazy style of dirt and eclectic sleaze. Now the real beauty of all this is the back ground music. In many different styles with many different instruments the sound of TELSTAR plays and replays- for those who don't understand Telstar was the first American Satellite launched into space and the theme was created to celebrate mans genius and triumph. MR MIKES seems to have been meant as a signal of societal decay ridiculous wastes. Now one thing the theater offered that the video release does not was a live performance of Sid Vicious (ex sex pistol not the wrestler) singing MY WAY. His version is very different than Sinatras as one might imagine but frankly I feel it is very much worth the listen...it's good! That is the sad part- in the VHS release Paul Anka refuses the rights of his song and the viewer is forced to experience 3 1/2 minutes of silence with an explanation rolling across the image of the singing dead sex pistol. <br /><br />I would give the theater release a 5 or 6 the video is closer to a 4 and now that so much is passé I can see where many people would give it a 3 or 2.5. If you want to see a good O'Donoghugh script watch SCROOGED...it is a better tribute to the mans insight and

{"value":"Anyone who has read my review for Uwe Boll's \"Alone In The Dark\" will remember that I compared the unenviable task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out. Well, take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine. Do that, and you'll have a general idea of what Eli Roth's \"Cabin Fever\" is all about.<br /><br />I never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that Uwe Boll cranks out as the \"worst film ever made.\" But, in all honesty, I have to say \"Cabin Fever\" comes very close. This is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release. For somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as Eli Roth does, he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie I think I have ever seen in my entire life. How do you screw up a story like this? Think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters, without the bad writing, and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy. A movie dealing with a grotesque flesh-eating virus could and should have been so much better than what Roth dished out for us here. This script failed on so many levels with me. And, while I do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses, I do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre.<br /><br />To say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words. A generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects can't even save it, and that is one element I normally go for. There really was nothing about \"Cabin Fever\" that I could easily recommend to anybody. When three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through, you know the movie is sinking fast. My best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing. One viewing was more than enough for me to know that I will most likely never bother with it

{"value":"My giving this a score of 3 is NOT what I would give the original Soviet version of this film. It seems that American-International (a studio that specialized in ultra-low-budget fare in the 60s) bought this film and utterly destroyed it--slicing a two hour plus film into a 64 minute film! Plus, much of this 64 minutes was new material (such as the \"monsters\")--so you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original. The original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the Soviet conquest of space--though I really am not sure what it was originally! For insight into the original film, read Steven Nyland's review--it was very helpful.<br /><br />By the way, this was the third Soviet sci-film I've seen that American-International bought and then hacked apart to make a \"new\" film--standard practice to a company that was willing to put just about anything on the screen to make a buck--provided, of course, it didn't cost them much more than a buck in the first place!! This Americanized film was about two rival world powers (NOT the US and Soviets) trying to be the first to Mars. The tricky \"bad guys\" try but fail and the \"good guys\" rescue one of the idiot astronauts and then head to Mars. Unfortunately, they are temporarily stranded on a moon of Mars where they see some monsters (added by American-International) that are REAAAALLY cheesy and one does bear similarity to a certain part of a female's anatomy. Then, they are rescued--returning to Earth heroes.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the film was butchered--turning an incredibly beautiful piece of art (for the time) being turned into a grade-C movie. Because of this, the Soviets really had a reason to hate America! I'm just shocked that the horrible job A-I did with this film didn't convince them to refuse to sell more films to these jerks! It's worth a look for a laugh, but the really bad moments that make you laugh are few and far between. So, the film is a dud--not bad enough to make it a must-see for bad movie buffs and too dopey to be taken seriously. I would really love to see this movie in its original form--it must have been some

{"value":"Back in the days before the Toxic Avenger, the low-camp kings at Troma Films tried to take the high (OK, somewhat-less-low) road of producing straight slasher pics. I'd like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for self-conscious parody.<br /><br />Splatter University is another film for the masochists in the audience. As it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots, it actually becomes painful to watch. Let's see if I can summarize.<br /><br />After learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital, the action moves to a Catholic university (I don't recall the name, but in honor of the title, let's call it St. Splatter). The students are listless and sullen, and argue pettily with each other, slackers ahead of their time. Meanwhile, the new professor, Julie Parker, proves utterly incompetent at her job. The kids deal with relationships, infidelity, unwanted pregnancies, lecherous priests, and how to avoid doing any work in class; Julie deals with a creepy boyfriend, the inflexible administration at St. Splatter, counseling unwed mothers, and the blank, expressionless looks of her students. None of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way. Oh, and every once in a while, a POV shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death, but don't hold your breath waiting for it. There's a Red Herring Killer, and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the Real Killer, then it's back to the asylum and roll credits.<br /><br />The slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer, which is helped along by choppy editing, coffee-can sound quality, and dialog that just doesn't make any sense. And the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killer's fixation on women - the men in this movie are just so deserving. I'd've paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend, or the lunkhead Lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriend's roommate, or any of the creepy priests.

{"value":"No movie with Madeleine Carroll in its cast could possibly be unwatchable. That said, I have to add that this British film comes close. The story takes place on board the `SS Atlantic' and it's loosely based on the `Titanic's' unfinished voyage. The word `unsinkable' is spoken, the liner strikes an iceberg, and we hear a heavenly choir sing `Nearer My God to Thee.' The doomed passengers eventually take over the anthem, in a clever bit of sound work. But the year of the film's release (1929) means that a modern viewer has to accept otherwise primitive sound and many of the acting conventions of silent films and the stage. These aren't problems. The film's major flaw is pacing, and pacing had been well developed in silents. However, if the dialog were delivered at a realistic speed, the movie's running time would be cut in half. The intended effect was drama (and clarity in a new medium), but the result unhappily is tiresome now. The film's structure is preposterously illogical and inept. Paradoxically, I found certain details of the editing quite modern in technique: fine, abrupt cuts from one area of the ship to another, sometimes even on sound effects. Although we're on board the `Atlantic' from the first shot, we were well over 4 minutes into the movie before I discovered that fact. There are long, intrusive musical passages by the ship's dance orchestra. (Entertaining, easy sound.) Personal stories are presented in an utterly uninvolving and unconvincing way. Don't even think of spectacle. The berg is a tiny thing and the exterior damage it does to the ship's hull is a minor dent. However, the scenes of passengers swarming into the lifeboats - clearly staged on a real liner, presumably tied up to a dock - generate great excitement. Other than the glorious Miss Carroll, these sequences are the film's only points of excellence. As the movie and the ship near their end, the screen goes totally black several times when the power generators begin to fail. Their last, eternal blackout is the end of the film, with a sunset/sunrise tacked on, a clumsy symbolic effect. `Atlantic' is a cinema curiosity.

{"value":"There is just one word for this film. Appalling. The director clearly has talent but like his character Robert Carmichael he throws it all away.<br /><br />Carmichael has potential, but like Cray he can't be bothered to use it. Being drawn into petty crime and then descending into depravity is Cray's vision of British youth. Like the British tabloids this film portrays young people with no aspirations or respect. Cray cries out for attention, but deserves none.<br /><br />I was appalled by the act of violence that Cray chose to shove in the faces of the audience. He assumes the audience are ignorant of world atrocities. Like a piece of obscene graffiti on a toilet wall he shows us male depravity with adolescent glee.<br /><br />Some actors of quality have small parts in this film. Danny Dyer and Leslie Manville both make short appearances. The acting is otherwise amateur, the young men Joe and Ben are cringe making. Carmichael played by Daniel Spencer is creepy. Miranda Wilson plays Monica, the attractive wife of celeb chef Jonathon (Michael Howe); how she was able to subject herself to such an ordeal is beyond belief. The film is never subtle and Monica is treated to the most gratuitous violence which is cut with war action. War imagery is used to convey the idea that young men cannot help themselves, that acts of violence will occur within even \"civilised\" countries. This is most certainly true and is symptomatic of our altered society where males have an increasingly less important position, but Cray descends to the level of the barbaric males he seeks to expose through his use of such brutal and violent images. The female characters in the film offer no relief. They are either victims or in Manville's case a washed out mother. The community is represented as dysfunctional.<br /><br />This is Cray's first film. I listened to what he had to say during a Q and A session at Edinburugh and he is not unintelligent, he simply lacks experience and his film exposes his naivety. The film is due to be released later this year, but I hope the company goes bust cos the public really don't need this kind of messed up

I didn't know it existed and was fully prepared to see the 1963 film version when I turned it on.<br /><br />I played Albert a long time ago and I am thinking of putting on an amateur production of the show because I remembered it as being so much fun to do. I was not impressed with this newer version. It just wasn't enough fun. It was not colorful. It lacked the exuberance of youth. The lighting was bad. No one seemed to mention this fact. This is not a moody musical, it is bright and up beat. The lighting decision was a poor creative choice.<br /><br />Bye Bye Birdy is a farce, a comedy of errors. I got no sense of that in this version. The lighting was awful and it dulled the overall performances. The dance numbers seemed anemic as well. We do have music videos these day. At least the dance numbers should have measured up to some of the best of those, or how about some of the best of Broadway. The choreographer was asleep at the wheel it seemed.<br /><br />Although all the actors were supremely talented, there were some really bad casting choices. Vanessa Williams is not Latin, and with so many talented Latin performers out there, wouldn't it have been more correct to cast one of them in the role of Rosie. Vanessa is African American, lovely and talented, but bad casting. Jason Alexander's effort was astounding, he always does intelligent work, but he just wasn't Albert. He was miscast and I think that is obvious to most people who see this version.<br /><br />The medium of film is not the medium of stage. There needs to be translation from one medium to another. The exuberance and the flash of stage musical must be TRANSLATED to film. There is no merit being faithful to a stage script when it is being filmed. The spirit, the essence of the production must be brought forth. To me the 1963 film production of Bye Bye Birdy was bright and lively, while the 1995 production was as gloomy as the lighting and as lackluster as the dance numbers.
