{"value":"Ursula Andress' naked body is one of those things that make you believe in God. The other two women (especially the one who plays the maid) have great bodies as well. Then why is the higher grade that I can give to a film with such quality and quantity of nudity only 3 out of 10? Because, to get to Ursula's unbelievable body, we have to sit through a movie that is otherwise unfunny and boring (keep in mind that I watched the full 101-minute version, not the 78-minute American one which probably cuts out a lot of the extraneous material). In typical Italian-comedy tradition, most of the characters are exaggerated caricatures (the army freak, the \"latin lover\", the constant drunk, the naive maid) that are not funny, simply overacted. Final word: watch this, but keep your finger on the fast-forward button, you're gonna need it.

{"value":"There was something here with the female lead having this perfect life she's always wanted after the worst life possible, beginning as a child prostitute and winding up with Eric Roberts. But her background makes it impossible for her to trust Dean Cain and this utterly destroys it in the end. It sounds weird, but I like the position Dean Cain was in at the end and the choice he made. He can't hurt her because he loves her and she's the mother of his child (I think the time frame makes it clear it's his child and not his brother's), but at the same he can't forgive her for all she's done, sleeping with his brother (which shows the love and obligation he felt was pretty much one way) and then being part of his death.

{"value":"Although Misty Ayers (burlesque stripper) is certainly attractive as the blonde lead, this flick is just an excuse to let her strip down to her underwear a few times (no nudity in 1954 when this film was made; not 1965).<br /><br />The guy who hires her to work in a whorehouse resembles Bud Abbott of Abbott & Costello. Most of the other woman are unattractive, and the drunken woman is semi-amusing in a creepy way.<br /><br />A 2 out of 10. Ms. Ayers has a curvacious physique, but you can't judge any acting talent because the ENTIRE film is post-dubbed. Some of these \"exploitation films\", usually made later than this one, are interesting in some way, but this is really a bore fest. Sid Melton (MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY) directed.

{"value":"I saw \"Rachel's Attic,\" thinking that I would be in for an enjoyably visceral, ride. However, it was not to be the case. Visceral, yes, but enjoyable? That would be a big, fat, no! In fact, the only reason that I gave it a \"3,\" is due to the fact that Gunnar Hansen appears (ever so briefly) as one of the film's reprehensible characters. How they ever lured Mr. Hansen into this piece of...work, I'll never know. The story idea is interesting but poorly executed. The direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre. The only thing that is worse than that, are the special effects. YIKES!!! I've seen better effects in a grade school play. Give it up, Mr. W, it's time for a career change...I hear they're hiring at Mel's Diner!

{"value":"I rented this movie today thinking it might be a good football movie, since I'm a big football fan. Boy, was I wrong. This movie is way too religious and preachy and is REALLY unrealistic. This movie pretty much says that if your a Christian you can get anything you want in life easily, like become a great football player! You don't become a great football player by becoming Christian and asking God, you do it through practice and hard work. All you gotta do is ask God and he'll give you anything....puh-lease. Thats not true at all, duh. I laughed several times because of this embarrassment. The only part that was funny was when they were being dumb (Shultz the cartoonist? no, the dude that flew over the Atlantic, etc etc..) but really this movie wasn't that great.

{"value":"Gorgeous bodies, gorgeous colors and camera work, pretentious dialog, banal plot. The name of the prima donna, Camilla, and the eponymous flowers that appear frequently, are enough to remind us of the plot similarities from Dumas' novel La Dame aux Camelias, the movie Camille starring Garbo and (I think) Robert Taylor, and last but not least Verdi's opera La Traviata. Beautiful, not-too-virtuous young ladies, social outcasts for one reason or another, loved, split up, reunited just in time to die of tuberculosis in the last scene... One forgives banal plots and stupid unrealistic dialog in opera, but why waste Hayak, Don Sutherland, a beautiful rendition of LA in the 30s, a deus ex machina earthquake that conveniently kills the

{"value":"Seriously, what is THIS? Hooper has made such classic films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then he made this god awful film, what happened? did he dip into the crack a little too much? This film is about some dude named Sam who has the ability to set things on fire,(Firestarter, anyone?) the acting was godawful, the plot was rubbish, and the special effects were extremely rubbish, they looked like something from the 70's. Van Damme should be pleased that Derailed is no longer the worst film ever, and what was with the ending? he started glowing blue, turned into a glowing blue blob, sucked out his girlfriends fire, and the film ended. WHAT WAS THAT?

{"value":"In spite of having some exciting (and daring) sequences, NBTN just never gets going. There are exploding boats, hat pin murders, mass suicides, pathologists with body parts, and all sorts of classic mystery/horror scenes, but they're interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition. Everybody in the movie looks bored. This is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed.<br /><br />Add to this the \"too-proper\" Brit characters and you feel like you've drifted into a Sherlock Holmes movie.<br /><br />Finally, the cinematography is very ordinary. There are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside, or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire, but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull.<br /><br

{"value":"Although there were some amusing moments, I thought the movie was pretty lame. The longer it ran, the worse it got. Once the action entered Monument Valley, I found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters.<br /><br />The character of the daughter was particularly incoherent. First she's in on the deal, then discovers the truth and she bails. Then she's back again, then deserts them again. Then she's back again. There's no apparent motivation for any of her decisions. There were interesting characters, some interesting scenes, and many missed possibilities. I would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts. Apparently the people who liked Repo Man were inclined to like this one.

{"value":"Investigative reporter Darren McGavin (as Carl Kolchak) is back; this time, he's after \"The Night Strangler\". Once again, police officials and fellow journalists either disbelieve, or want to cover-up, the supernatural angle. Producer-director Dan Curtis presents the same basic story as his preceding \"Night\", with understandably less success.<br /><br />Mr. Curtis assembles a fun supporting cast, included are \"Dark Shadows\" alumni George DiCenzo and Ivor Francis. Jo Ann Pflug (as Louise Harper) heads up a sexy collection of belly-dancers. And, although I've never seen it mentioned anywhere, that must be Roger Davis as Mr. McGavin's dining companion in an early scene, feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires! <br /><br />**** The

{"value":"this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie... ever. and what is up with the casting. the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose dis-figuration and is almost impossible to look at for any period of time without becoming fixated on her nose. you could go to your local grocery store on a Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified, better looking possible leading ladies. i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a \"cool\" DVD case. This movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college. i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public

{"value":"That reviewers liked this movie surprises me. The plot is a muddle. The characters are wooden. Michael Bowen spends most of the film spying on the other characters and misjudging all of them. No one has any redeeming quality or point-of-interest. This is not an edgy work. It is not imaginative. It is not ironic. It is no clever. There is nothing straight forward about this tedious work. That is missed theatrical release is not surprise. That the \"This Network\" airs it diminishes that venue. I definitely recommend turning to a rerun of the Garden Smart show on PBS or even a good informational if you encountered this mess on late night television. If you encounter it on daytime television, take a long walk. Even if you walk in smog, you will feel better not having suffered through this shambles. Life is short.

{"value":"I haven't seen it in over twenty years. OJ was the bus driver, Arte Johnson was the tour guide, Lorenzo was the kidnapper.<br /><br />Yea, Lorenzo looked very much at home as the villain, a natural. I think I watched it back then most for OJ, who I had seen Towering Inferno and Cassandra Crossing, but also to see Arte Johnson.<br /><br />I was a little bored that Johnson was so serious.<br /><br />And yes, it shifted plots. In reading other posts, I remember that was some plot that they were going to kidnap some rich girl, but then that priceless stamp business turned up out of the blue.<br /><br />I was going, a stamp? If it came on as a late movie, I would probably record it to check it out again, but I wouldn't be nostalgic over it.

{"value":"This movie is just so awful. So bad that I can't bear to expend anything other than just a few words. Avoid this movie at all costs, it is terrible.<br /><br />None of the details of the crimes are re-enacted correctly. Lots of slaughterhouse footage. Weird cuts and edits. No continuity to the plot. The acting is absolutely the most amateur I have ever seen.<br /><br />This bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of it's content. The camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky. It looks as if it was shot on video.<br /><br />In fact, now that they've got Dennis Rader with life in prison, I wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as well.<br /><br />Seriously, don't even think about watching this one.

{"value":"Watched this film having really enjoyed Gregory's Girl many years ago. This was drivel. The plot was vaguely distasteful with the teacher and his friend perving over 14-15-year-old girls in very short skirts. Previous commenters seem to think that this doesn't matter, but I found it rather nasty. If you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every youngish teacher is lusting after his pupils. We were surprised that the censor let that through. Apart from that the film was just a waste of time. The script was poor and John Gordon Sinclair trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image, slightly wacky and off the wall. Why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible. This film failed on all counts for me. Dreadful. Please don't waste your time watching it.

{"value":"Any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake. Alex Baldwin trying to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn't work. While Baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, never try to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw enough said. McQueen looked dangerous, menacing and believable as Doc, the film had excitement and suspense,Baldwin and company made this into a comedy,I laughed the one and only time I saw this miserable film. And that dreadful hairstyle for Michael Madsen who is one of today's more exciting and believable actors!

{"value":"I could not even bring myself to watch this movie to the end. I cannot comment on the story as I did not watch the whole film and the reason I couldn't watch it was because of the 'actors'. Firstly, for the most part they just looked stiff and I'm sure their scripts were in their hands just out of frame - but that's a minor issue. The main issue I have with the actors isn't really their fault... it's whoever cast this film! Come on, this movie came out in 2003... I thought that casting people in their late twenties to play teenagers went out of fashion with new wave?! I cannot watch a movie where one of the first lines, from a grown man older than myself, is \"I'm 17!\" How can anyone take that seriously?????

{"value":"Anna lives with her family in a new housing estate just outside the city. She has been with her husband Sebastiaan for years and they don't talk so much anymore. While on a working visit abroad, a female colleague commits suicide. Anna is deeply impressed by her death, even though she hardly knew her. Nobody seems to know why she took her own life. For the first time Anna realizes that one can be an unknown among your most dearest. Anna doesn't mention the incident back home and starts observing her husband and child. Guernsey is the story of a woman who suddenly starts looking at her own life. And she wonders how she got so drifted apart from the people closest to her.<br /><br />(This is my translation of the DVD cover text synopsis.

{"value":"you have a strong stomach. Holden was actually 55 years old at filming but looked near 70 and he only lived another 8 years. At one point Holden said, \"I am over twice your age.\" Okay, try triple grandpa! The \"old enough to be your father\" theme they were shooting for didn't work. Granted senior citizens sometimes wind up with legal teens. More power to them, but that doesn't mean I want to watch it. It's not a matter of judgment but the digestive track. I like my food where it belongs. Lenz is fun to watch and the 70s cars, clothes, furniture, etc. make it worth it if it comes on cable late at night and you want to watch something to wind down for bed. It would have been nice to see the blonde friend of Lenz, the one who hocked her guitar, get more scenes. Pleasingly spacey... Who was this chick?

{"value":"I was rooting for this film as it's a remake of a 1970s children's TV series \"Escape into Night\" which, though chaotic and stilted at times was definitely odd, fascinating and disturbing. The acting in \"Paperhouse\" is wooden, unintentionally a joke. The overdubs didn't add tension they only reinforced that I was sat watching a botch. Casting exasperated the dreary dialogue which resulted in relationships lacking warmth, chemistry or conviction. As in most lacklustre films there are a few good supporting acts these people should be comforted, consoled and reassured that they will not be held responsible. Out of all the possible endings the most unexpected was chosen ... lamer than I could have dreamt.<br /><br />\"Escape into Night\" deserves a proper remake, written by someone with life experience

{"value":"Wow and I thought that any Steven Segal movie was bad. Every time I thought that the movie couldn't get worse it proved me wrong. The story was good but the actors couldn't carry it off. Also, they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done. For instance you don't handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for. The biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl. She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was. The whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me. I like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff, so that almost seemed depressing. I thought that the characters wern't explained well enough.

{"value":"WHITE CHICKS Hold on, why couldn't they have dressed as Black Chicks, oh yeah, they wouldn't look different at all. Can anyone give me one Wayans movie where they haven't dressed up as ladies? Don't Be A Menace doesn't count, Jack White and Michael Costanza ghost wrote that (the other Norton Trio members acted as Directors).<br /><br />In White Chicks, there's never really any jokes. It's just the Wayans acting like girls for 2 hours. There's no setups, no punchlines and no laughs. There is a lot of \"I think I'm gonna play some Time Crisis 3.\" At least for me there was (5 times to be exact).<br /><br />Somebody has to tell Kenan Ivory, Damon, Marlon, Shawn, Damien (the only talented one), Kim, Rakeesha, George W., and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making movies.

{"value":"The year 1934 was when Shirley Temple played three major movies and really began to make a name for herself. Unfortunately, the studios had to experiment to see what the public best liked about here. Two of those things were singing and dancing. Another was a short, interesting film that kept people's attention and got their minds off The Depression. You know the other keys to Shirley's successful films.<br /><br />This film achieved none of the above, despite the star presences of Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard and despite a very good director in Henry Hathaway. In addition, there are too many talky parts in here which become simply boring, and too many arguments between a sullen Lombard and Cooper. To top it off, you didn't get the normal feel-good ending which is what the public wants.

{"value":"I never saw the original 1954 version with Judy Garland, so have no means of comparison. Also, it's been some years, but I found this tale neither gripping nor its romance captivating. The movie tells the story of two lovers whose musical careers are headed in opposite directions. John Norman Howard is a worn out, disillusioned rock star on the decline, embarking upon a romance with a fresh, talented new singing sensation, Esther Hoffman. Her dramatic success only serves to emphasize his decline.<br /><br />The lead actors, Kris Kristofferson and Barbra Streisand, are adequate in their roles, but neither their chemistry nor the plot left much of a mark with me. The film is noteworthy to me for only one aspect, Streisand's beautiful rendition of the Oscar winning song 'Evergreen'.

{"value":"Let me start out by saying this movie has 1 funny point at the very beginning with the exchange between the narrator and George: Narrator:Huh? Wait a minute! Who the heck are you? George: Me new George. Studio too cheap to pay Brendan Fraser. Narrator: How did you get the part? George: New George just lucky, I guess. <br /><br />Sadly, that's the only funny part in the entire movie.<br /><br />It was still entertaining...But then again, i'm easily entertained...<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is the worst movie i've ever seen (that title goes to the terribly un-funny Disaster Movie...), This movie falls #7 on my bottom 15 list...<br /><br />If your a small child who is easily entertained, you'll enjoy this movie. If you're a movie-watcher who wants a good, funny movie, You'll end up shooting yourself halfway through this one..","finished_norm":["let","me","start","out","by","sai","thi","movi","have","funni","point","at","the","veri","begin","with","the","exchang","between","the","narrat","and","georg","narratorhuh","wait","a","minut","who","the","heck","be","you","georg","me","new","georg","studio","too","cheap","to","pai","brendan","fraser","narrat","how","do","you","get","the","part","georg","new","georg","just","lucki","i","guess","br","br","sadli","that","the","onli","funni","part","in","the","entir","moviebr","br","it","be","still","entertainingbut","then","again","i","be","easili","entertainedbr","br","i","would","not","sai","thi","be","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","that","titl","go","to","the","terribli","unfunni","disast","movi","thi","movi","fall","on","my","bottom","listbr","br","if","your","a","small","child","who","be","easili","entertain","you","will","enjoi","thi","movi","if","you","re","a","moviewatch","who","want","a","good","funni","movi","you","will","end","up","shoot","yourself","halfwai","through","thi","on"],"filtered":["let","start","sai","thi","movi","funni","point","veri","begin","exchang","narrat","georg","narratorhuh","wait","minut","heck","georg","new","georg","studio","cheap","pai","brendan","fraser","narrat","get","part","georg","new","georg","lucki","guess","br","br","sadli","onli","funni","part","entir","moviebr","br","still","entertainingbut","easili","entertainedbr","br","sai","thi","wrong","movi","ever","see","titl","go","terribli","unfunni","disast","movi","thi","movi","fall","bottom","listbr","br","small","child","easili","entertain","enjoi","thi","movi","re","moviewatch","want","good","funni","movi","end","shoot","halfwai","thi"],"filtered2":["let","start","funni","point","veri","begin","exchang","narrat","georg","narratorhuh","wait","minut","heck","georg","new","georg","studio","cheap","pai","brendan","fraser","narrat","get","part","georg","new","georg","lucki","guess","sadli","onli","funni","part","entir","moviebr","still","entertainingbut","easili","entertainedbr","wrong","ever","see","titl","go","terribli","unfunni","disast","fall","bottom","listbr","small","child","easili","entertain","enjoi","re","moviewatch","want","good","funni","end","shoot","halfwai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,11,15,24,25,37,44,59,61,62,64,66,68,71,87,117,124,147,169,180,195,198,200,243,264,322,331,351,363,465,583,680,706,860,932,948,1034,1152,1214,1396,1546,2024,2985,5616,8350],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,11,15,24,25,37,44,59,61,62,64,66,68,71,87,117,124,147,169,180,195,198,200,243,264,322,331,351,363,465,583,680,706,860,932,948,1034,1152,1214,1396,1546,2024,2985,5616,8350],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.3210361566119257,1.2796387880827016,1.4876543214774305,1.604729392502474,1.8693254449200722,3.7637034094785053,6.06783613352078,1.883428577602134,1.929723173391612,2.0064197866819473,1.9214926742550966,4.230048743045324,2.2797301185117202,2.2323930368088845,2.2844323215331563,2.4071371113909277,2.7097314792693545,2.51289241584188,2.5439726117360975,2.5308211829319704,2.627841366673578,2.757740698455715,2.885344817328191,2.932274249550174,3.0135689919434205,3.0349689855553557,3.2681460658591432,6.9973394489419505,19.047732069516123,3.6284289511740746,3.8538340941043407,4.058285512406398,4.049068857301474,4.125296222689358,4.213208095012239,8.913660355339978,4.409683399244287,4.566029469634981,4.890269137820559,5.426230734858092,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0828873612852456E-4,2.081041609493376E-4,2.0815554347424278E-4,2.08113697551707E-4,2.0813339304459255E-4,2.0810301352577545E-4,2.0816773645214107E-4,2.0807205119149452E-4,2.0810420493002458E-4,2.0831925807556967E-4,2.099722107549352E-4,2.0810454866435687E-4,2.0830163682280373E-4,2.083233382595854E-4,2.0822870240647193E-4,2.0811451728144033E-4,2.081861167241699E-4,2.0828408981847664E-4,2.081252613366422E-4,2.0812450041003723E-4,2.0831174003631465E-4,2.081453523601866E-4,2.0814566737013894E-4,2.082790077132369E-4,2.0812533641266458E-4,2.0832582823766956E-4,2.0817741897229816E-4,2.0810369454473218E-4,2.0819803986654262E-4,2.0826158490941754E-4,2.0814637334682753E-4,2.0825785201168093E-4,2.0836010141789886E-4,2.0855349190005543E-4,2.0817705923586552E-4,2.0811439105668648E-4,2.0818942804771062E-4,2.081355270165613E-4,2.0807227326983955E-4,2.0812519688363562E-4,2.0833377389740363E-4,2.082194897084144E-4,2.0825832659544365E-4,2.0808262900365483E-4,2.081252498046008E-4,2.0811431279772944E-4,2.08184757605707E-4,2.082208571028852E-4,2.081785165682047E-4,2.0814551990552937E-4,2.0811482744843333E-4,2.0854122093255103E-4,2.0816719513391536E-4,2.0812520210255778E

{"value":"This movie had mediocrity, laziness, and thoughtlessness written all over it. If you are going to do a movie about vampires that has been done thousands of times already, then you better do a damn good job. I'll be the first to say that this movie just did not cut it. Some scary/horror movies just fail to break the mold of the \"lets do something forbidden and forsaken for the sake of fun because all the stories are just lies\" cliché. This one, sadly, was no different, and like all scary movies, once you venture down that road there is no going back.<br /><br />And the ending? How do the heroes do the same job over and over throughout the movie, but then mysteriously they get wrapped up in the moment and cannot do the job in the end? The ending was very anti-climatic and spelled part 3 which I will never watch. Terrible movie.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","have","mediocr","lazi","and","thoughtless","write","all","over","it","if","you","be","go","to","do","a","movi","about","vampir","that","have","be","do","thousand","of","time","alreadi","then","you","well","do","a","damn","good","job","i","will","be","the","to","sai","that","thi","movi","just","do","not","cut","it","some","scaryhorror","movi","just","fail","to","break","the","mold","of","the","let","do","someth","forbid","and","forsak","for","the","sake","of","fun","becaus","all","the","stori","be","just","lie","cliché","thi","on","sadli","be","no","differ","and","like","all","scari","movi","onc","you","ventur","down","that","road","there","be","no","go","backbr","br","and","the","end","how","do","the","hero","do","the","same","job","over","and","over","throughout","the","movi","but","then","mysteri","thei","get","wrap","up","in","the","moment","and","cannot","do","the","job","in","the","end","the","end","be","veri","anticlimat","and","spell","part","which","i","will","never","watch","terribl","movi"],"filtered":["thi","movi","mediocr","lazi","thoughtless","write","go","movi","vampir","thousand","time","alreadi","well","damn","good","job","sai","thi","movi","cut","scaryhorror","movi","fail","break","mold","let","someth","forbid","forsak","sake","fun","becaus","stori","lie","cliché","thi","sadli","differ","like","scari","movi","onc","ventur","road","go","backbr","br","end","hero","job","throughout","movi","mysteri","thei","get","wrap","moment","job","end","end","veri","anticlimat","spell","part","never","watch","terribl","movi"],"filtered2":["mediocr","lazi","thoughtless","write","go","vampir","thousand","time","alreadi","well","damn","good","job","cut","scaryhorror","fail","break","mold","let","someth","forbid","forsak","sake","fun","becaus","stori","lie","cliché","sadli","differ","like","scari","onc","ventur","road","go","backbr","end","hero","job","throughout","mysteri","get","wrap","moment","job","end","end","veri","anticlimat","spell","part","never","watch","terribl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,7,8,15,17,20,22,24,42,53,61,65,124,166,188,204,215,236,259,289,303,330,360,375,396,403,438,485,523,650,706,787,889,1080,1270,1393,1530,1781,1989,2974,3398,4340,5677,7868,8218],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,4,6,7,8,15,17,20,22,24,42,53,61,65,124,166,188,204,215,236,259,289,303,330,360,375,396,403,438,485,523,650,706,787,889,1080,1270,1393,1530,1781,1989,2974,3398,4340,5677,7868,8218],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9416538289407692,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,3.9631084698357775,1.6219954307453837,1.7003182735607676,1.8818517047392527,1.9073850067444174,2.2323930368088845,2.4423870329693536,2.5378812223426954,2.624524614047584,2.605934685587711,2.617923930016232,2.7464553122240485,8.484797997427084,2.868298950055202,2.9292757465539174,3.028335462059722,3.2597778161886266,3.291526514503207,3.189397019426827,3.1797351085150902,4.160564361526816,3.4986697244709752,3.6621227969605474,3.6284289511740746,3.760240652919071,3.9571003681590526,4.229557233013768,4.3521595551061,4.436351646326448,4.605250182788262,4.838444069955973,4.911775343041523,5.501738287366237,5.583416318380505,5.907203395474402,6.389041482367141,6.868614562629026,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255724E-4,2.2737792632708282E-4,2.2743406769354613E-4,2.2738834617097768E-4,2.2740986578072446E-4,2.2737667263379296E-4,2.274473899357234E-4,2.273428426933875E-4,2.273779743810831E-4,2.2761294487884295E-4,2.2941898734736633E-4,2.2737834995069844E-4,2.2759369161694308E-4,2.276174029529934E-4,2.275140023100703E-4,2.2738924182076221E-4,2.274674725141792E-4,2.275745194800721E-4,2.2740098094688538E-4,2.274001495463371E-4,2.2760473054921082E-4,2.2742293271974028E-4,2.2742327690463985E-4,2.2756896669080777E-4,2.2740106297614523E-4,2.2762012354277304E-4,2.2745796921172105E-4,2.2737741672597E-4,2.274804999297563E-4,2.2754993025739297E-4,2.2742404826603288E-4,2.2754585163377165E-4,2.276575709662826E-4,2.2786887249242005E-4,2.2745757615795552E-4,2.2738910390558237E-4,2.2747109051910833E-4,2.274121973925427E-4,2.2734308533973029E-4,2.2740091052450212E-4,2.2762880509736276E-4,2.2750393636919412E-4,2.2754637017156226E-4,2.2735440017971126E-4,2.27400968346793E-4,2.2738901839859738E-4,2.274659875196634E-4,2.275054304062082E-4,2.2745916846251947E-4,2.274231157824548E-4,2.2738958071416714E-4,2.278554650375549E-4,2.2744679848279385E-4,2.2740091622677977E-4,2.2744558042094647E-4,2.273776493639774E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441392E-4,2.2738989994003454E-4,2.273775195710166E-4,2.27559427041036E-4,2.2746807898261527E-4,2.27377424521243

I can tell somewhat of the story, but heck thats about as far as it goes. The peoples identities are not a mystery, if they were a mystery I would care about them. Instead I wasn't them off the screen ASAP.<br /><br />Tons of wide shots and silent emotionless faces occupy this movie. Heck is it boring, not only do I not know these people, but they are just sitting there.<br /><br />The production is typical Chinese John Woo, terrible video with blotched scenes. This looks only slightly better than Andy Lau's \"Fulltime Killer\" (Which was a great movie.) You would think with a decent budget they could at least make it look like 90s Hollywood. I didn't know the Chinese had these art-house beatniks.","finished_norm":["the","main","complaint","with","thi","film","be","the","fact","that","i","can","not","tell","who","be","who","no","racism","intend","but","thi","asian","look","all","the","same","i","can","tell","somewhat","of","the","stori","but","heck","that","about","a","far","a","it","go","the","peopl","ident","be","not","a","mysteri","if","thei","be","a","mysteri","i","would","care","about","them","instead","i","be","not","them","off","the","screen","asapbr","br","ton","of","wide","shot","and","silent","emotionless","face","occupi","thi","movi","heck","be","it","bore","not","onli","do","i","not","know","thi","peopl","but","thei","be","just","sit","therebr","br","the","product","be","typic","chines","john","woo","terribl","video","with","blotch","scene","thi","look","onli","slightli","well","than","andi","lau","fulltim","killer","which","be","a","great","movi","you","would","think","with","a","decent","budget","thei","can","at","littl","make","it","look","like","hollywood","i","do","not","know","the","chines","have","thi","arthous","beatnik"],"filtered":["main","complaint","thi","film","fact","tell","racism","intend","thi","asian","look","tell","somewhat","stori","heck","far","go","peopl","ident","mysteri","thei","mysteri","care","instead","screen","asapbr","br","ton","wide","shot","silent","emotionless","face","occupi","thi","movi","heck","bore","onli","know","thi","peopl","thei","sit","therebr","br","product","typic","chines","john","woo","terribl","video","blotch","scene","thi","look","onli","slightli","well","andi","lau","fulltim","killer","great","movi","think","decent","budget","thei","littl","make","look","like","hollywood","know","chines","thi","arthous","beatnik"],"filtered2":["main","complaint","fact","tell","racism","intend","asian","look","tell","somewhat","stori","heck","far","go","peopl","ident","mysteri","mysteri","care","instead","screen","asapbr","ton","wide","shot","silent","emotionless","face","occupi","heck","bore","onli","know","peopl","sit","therebr","product","typic","chines","john","woo","terribl","video","blotch","scene","look","onli","slightli","well","andi","lau","fulltim","killer","great","think","decent","budget","littl","make","look","like","hollywood","know","chines","arthous","beatnik"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,11,12,14,16,17,19,20,23,26,51,90,97,101,108,152,166,179,190,192,205,240,244,251,252,256,291,300,309,403,441,596,613,926,965,1225,1421,1546,1582,1608,1647,1672,1955,2271,2560,2739,4368,4526,4611,7223],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,11,12,14,16,17,19,20,23,26,51,90,97,101,108,152,166,179,190,192,205,240,244,251,252,256,291,300,309,403,441,596,613,926,965,1225,1421,1546,1582,1608,1647,1672,1955,2271,2560,2739,4368,4526,4611,7223],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.9708269144703846,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,3.589841616087325,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,2.729695454751562,2.6649848339420377,1.7139899308309823,4.095425683930709,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.138507503627933,2.3131195476980753,2.4423870329693536,2.507968722980095,2.558331832813986,2.5318267134339894,2.571852579609833,2.7666071276613566,2.634508058031767,2.6942272927333892,3.0433232530252132,2.748952192422636,3.016831637578237,2.932274249550174,2.848772527704847,6.378794038853654,3.293679367864308,3.485528930909917,3.5364100524538222,3.9323057095458362,3.9868265484242533,4.470719289830655,4.733083554298147,9.132058939269962,4.621379564718146,4.605250182788262,4.933754249760298,10.258997653772786,4.869215728622727,5.02684467282631,5.290429193699031,5.521540914662417,6.0662680901040895,5.999576715605417,5.999576715605417,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.98208034250792E-4,1.9803239209117198E-4,1.980812878185435E-4,1.9804146714364097E-4,1.9806020941939246E-4,1.9803130020030484E-4,1.980928906839975E-4,1.9800183637269848E-4,1.9803243394329357E-4,1.9823707900490478E-4,1.9981003252786658E-4,1.9803276104166467E-4,1.9822031058076102E-4,1.9824096171727884E-4,1.9815090602457111E-4,1.9804224720031656E-4,1.981103813925953E-4,1.9820361281160025E-4,1.9805247126764263E-4,1.9805174716815756E-4,1.9822992482167886E-4,1.9807158993126716E-4,1.980718896954531E-4,1.9819877666871444E-4,1.98052542710156E-4,1.9824333118607758E-4,1.9810210459216462E-4,1.9803194825949042E-4,1.9812172748195046E-4,1.9818219708903884E-4,1.9807256150447297E-4,1.9817864485507656E-4,1.982759456222062E-4,1.9845997644414852E-4,1.9810176226615846E-4,1.9804212708455417E-4,1.9811353245559552E-4,1.9806224011196342E-4,1.9800204770295586E-4,1.9805240993401522E-4,1.9825089229392234E-4,1.9814213920018076E-4,1.9817909647006277E-4,1.9801190224276875E-4,1.9805246029372587E-4,1.98042052613152

{"value":"Apparently Hollywood is just handing out money to anyone with a camera and the ability to speak. This movie was mind numbingly bad. The casting was terrible, the acting unspeakable, and the story filled with holes. Script? who needs script? I was surprised that the movie wasn't as verbally vulgar as I thought it would be, however I got enough shots of T&A to last me a lifetime. The movie was like listening to a 19 year old street racer with ADD (who decided to buy a car instead of go to college) tell a story. Being so poorly scripted, I thought the two brothers in the film were lovers at first. The scenes at the racetrack, along with the main female actor in the film kept making me think of Herbie: Fully Loaded.

{"value":"This Italian film from the '70's is NOT even in the class with Dog Soldiers, The Howling, or even that awful American Werewolf in Paris, BUT...it is fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, run amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic, complete nudity...it's obvious that she is a real blonde...humma humma humma!! The story is a hoot, the SFX are childish, and the acting (for the most part) stinks. The only redeeming value of this movie is all (and there is a LOT) the nudity & sex scenes. Tame by HBO standards, but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. OK...HERE'S THE SPOILER...There is NO werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine(??)'s ancestor.

{"value":"It is pretty surreal what these flies can do... eh well... this is a cartoon, so anything can happen in it.<br /><br />At first I must tell you that I love animated movies. Unfortunately this year's repertoire is very weak. This cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws:<br /><br />1) I quoted the tag line. It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects. Well, I did not see any, at least not something special I never saw before.<br /><br />2) The \"flies\" in this movie look nothing like real flies. At least they could've make them black. But cyan flies, seriously? With giant heads and slim torsos?<br /><br />3) The story. I guess it was written for 6 year old kids. I could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified.<br /><br />4) Excessive patriotism.

{"value":"This movie was awful. I had a very difficult time watching this all the way through. I didn't get the point of the movie. What was the point of this movie? The soundtrack was bad, acting was bad and the story uninspiring. The two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting. There was no chemistry among any of the cast members. I don't know this for a fact, but I suspect that most of the actors were first timers. The movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot. That indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie. I would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie. I want those two hours back! If you want to watch good, funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons, watch Napoleon Dynamite

{"value":"The movie opens up with a long single shot of aisles in factory crammed with workers. My, what we've done to the planet you might think. I hope we get to see other things like this.<br /><br />That's very rare. When you're not looking at a horribly filmed angle of the narrator at a lecture hall, you're watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations. It'd be nice if chose areas that were more fitting with his topic but he doesn't. So, then you'll hear some more narration, watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera. Why not use the filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead? It really kills any sense of pacing and paints the guy as more of vain jerk.<br /><br />I could read tips on how someone set up their camera, fast forward through this whole movie and waste a lot less
