{"value":"Lame, lame, lame!!! A 90-minute cringe-fest that's 89 minutes too long. A setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility (an abandoned convent) is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky, witless dialogue that's straining oh-so-hard to be hip. Mostly it's just embarrassing, and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat (a sample of this movie's dialogue: after demonstrating her artillery, fast dolly shot to a closeup of Barbeau's vigilante characterÂ…she: `any questions?' hyuck hyuck hyuck). Bad acting, idiotic, homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects, it looks like the director's watched `The Evil Dead' way too many times. <br /><br />I owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they'll never get back.

{"value":"Always enjoy great films which deal with the super-natural and the deep thoughts of the Spiritual world. However, this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction. There is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell; all I can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen. The actors, namely: Mark Addy, Thomas Garrett, gave an outstanding performance in his native land England, and we have seen him in \"Still Standing\" a TV Series. Heath Ledger, played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in \"Brokeback Mountain\",'05, gave a great supporting role. Shannyn Sossaman, (Mara Sinclair), did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith.

{"value":"This film is to the F.B.I.'s history as Knott's Berry Farm is to the old west. Shamelessly sanitized version of the Federal Bureau of Investigation fight against crime. Hoover's heavy hand (did he have any other kind?) shows throughout with teevee quality script-reading actors, cheesy sets, cheap sound effects and lighting 101. With Jimmy Stewart at 20% of dramatic capacity, Vera Miles chewing the scenery, the film features every c-lister known in the mid-fifties with nary a hint of irony or humor, from the 'Amazon jungle' to the 'back yard barbecue', everything reeks of sound stages and back lots. Even the gunshots are canned and familiar. I imagine Mervyn Leroy got drunk every night.

{"value":"This was a disappointment - none of the nuance of the original. The Brits just seem to be able to make a truly unsettling film with none of the over-the-top histrionics of the American version. The original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings. I have watched the series many times and am still enthralled.<br /><br />Just another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of \"Cracker\". Get hooked up with BBC America or BBC Canada and watch for such delights as Waking the Dead, Spooks, Silent Witness, and Judge John Deed. Watch the original Touching Evil, then look for \"Wire in the Blood\" for more of the truly understated, elegant performance of Robson Green.

{"value":"For the knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the flaws, inaccuracies, combined events, omitted events, wildly exaggerated events, omitted people, timeline errors, mis-attribute quotes, incorrect clothing, out of place songs, and (shame shame) incorrect instruments and other boners I just cant think of right now. The flaws come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes.<br /><br />I didn't give this a \"1\" primarily due the fact that it is filmed in Liverpool and the actors (the band Rain) give it their all (the Lennon character is credible and does a good job). Also, the song \"Cry for a Shadow\" is heard at one point and THAT counts for SOMETHING.<br /><br />So,,, watch it for fun, but please don't take it as historically

{"value":"- The movie opens with a meteor crashing into a lake. Unbeknownst to the locals, a dinosaur egg is also at the bottom of the lake. The meteor heats the lake, turning it into a giant incubator. You guessed it, the egg hatches releasing a dinosaur that proceeds to terrorize the community.<br /><br />- What utter garbage. It's not that I mind the stop-motion clay dinosaur, it's everything else about the movie that bothers me. The acting is atrocious. The dialogue is utterly ridiculous. The comic relief is anything but comic. Logic is non-existent. Any similarity between the \"scientists\" in this movie and an actual scientist is purely coincidental. I could go on for an eternity on the bad aspects of this movie, but you get the idea.

{"value":"With this cast and budget you will expect more.<br /><br />John Cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange, yet still work. Neither he, his sister, nor Sir Ben could do anything to save this travesty of trite poorly written garbage.<br /><br />The movie is nothing more than a series of sight gags and poor ones at that. The plot goes nowhere, the writing is contrived, senseless and the characters paper thin. If you think of a movie as being three dimensional where the story and characters bring a depth to the imagery, this stinker comes across as flat as steamboat mickey.<br /><br />Dan Akroyd's appearance in this brought back memories of another truly awful movie, 1991's Nothing but Trouble.

{"value":"I first learned of the Wendigo many years ago in one of Alvin Schwartz's \"Scary Stories\" books: according to that story, the Wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - drags you along, and then pulls you up into the sky and pulverizes you. While it sounds like a pretty bizarre notion, Schwartz's story turned it into a fairly coherent idea.<br /><br />The movie \"Wendigo\" doesn't. It basically consists of every horror flick clichÃ©: family moves to new house and strange things start happening, anyone who harms them is asking for it, and everyone had better listen to the old Indian guy. I've seen this stuff so many times that I no longer bother to count.<br /><br />Anyway, avoid it.

{"value":"I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about, to prevent it from happening again. I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK. The movie was pretty terrible. All clichÃ©, no real plot. Historical and technical inaccuracies abound. Look up the technical specs on DE 529, or any Everts class Destroyer Escort, and you will see what I mean. I now its black history month in the US, and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this, but the history of this ship is not that great. They did some escort work, chased a \"submarine\" that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed. Sorry, but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for. This movie makes them look like whiners.

{"value":"How, in the name of all that's holy, did this film ever get distribution? It looks as if it has been shot on someone's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths. They literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie. And that's all they do. There is no plot, no tension, no characters, and not a lot of acting. Just screaming and more screaming.<br /><br />I gave up after fifteen minutes and fast-wound through it to see if anything happened. It doesn't - except for screaming, of course. Odlly enough, the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem - there is no camera-work to speak of. Every shot looks like every other shot - middle distance, one angle, dull, dull, DULL.<br /><br />It's not so bad it's good.

{"value":"The movie had a cute opening, I truly believed I was in for one of the best romantic comedies i've seen in a while... there was something particular \"foreign\" about the way the movie was set up, realistic yet somewhat abstract and mystical. But then the story line started becoming more and more unrealistic. To say that the ending was CORNY and PREDICTABLE would almost be an understatement... The most typical romantic ending where everything goes great for every 'likable' character. A scene where the main character realises that he has made a mistake and chases the \"woman of his dreams\" only to confess his love for her in front of a sympathetic crowd of on- lookers. Come on. In the end, the 'good guys' win, 'bad guys' loose... You get the picture.

{"value":"Thank God! I didn't waste my money renting it but i downloaded it! This happens to be the worst movie i have ever seen in my whole life, f*****g visual effects, unnecessary gore and nudity! Far apart from other Zombie movies like Night of the Living Dead and others. There are lots of loop holes and mistakes in the movie. OK if you get time after reading this comment, please check out the director's(Ulli Lommel) profile. After seeing that i got a self explanation why the movie is like this, i mean every movie directed by Ulli Lommel gets a rating between 1 and 2. And now am not willing to search what kinda movies these are directed by him, but i can finish all this by saying one strong sentence.

{"value":"If your idea of entertainment is watching graphic footage of people being run over by cars (you get to see a woman passing under the front wheel, being twisted as the car passes over her before she goes under the back wheel -- and they show it twice in case you missed it the first time) then this is the documentary for you. Admitedly I didn't watch any more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism, but that was enough for me. Maybe the rest is even better.<br /><br />I wonder how long it's going to take for television networks to start showing slush movies. Perhaps game shows based on self-mutilation might be nice.<br /><br />I already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen.

{"value":"Well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview, else I would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie. I mean haven't we had enough of this yet? Scream and Scary Movie at least did not take them self serious! The plot sucks, and the acting is the worst I've seen. (Only Godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst I've seen in the cinema with this one.)<br /><br />There is so many plot holes in the story, and the girls are so alike, that you don't even now who has been killed, and who has not. (and you don't care.)

{"value":"Obviously made to show famous 1950s stripper Misty Ayers \"acting\" talents. Too bad she can't act.<br /><br />Boring little tale about sweet, innocent Sally Down (Ayers) being drugged and forced into white slavery (prostitution). Then she meets likable Tommy Cole who instantly falls in love with her. He wants to help her escape but can he? You really won't care.<br /><br />There's no real skin here--Ayers just strips down SLOWLY to her underwear (twice). The rest is just a boring little tale chockful of bad acting, atrocious \"comedy\" (never thought prostitution was funny but what do I know?) and terrible post-dubbed dialogue. I admit there was a twist at the end I didn't see coming but that's not enough to sit through this. Also Ayers' attempts at acting are hysterical! A real bomb.

{"value":"And how it made it into production astounds me. The main character is an obnoxious show off who isn't the least bit funny. I can't stand the character at all. He's a dumb ass with nothing to offer the show. <br /><br />This is the worst cartoon to surface in the last 10 years, no joke. The story lines are both poorly written and executed. The jokes are as bad as the ones on Disney's Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I could not dislike this show more, it's terrible and should be canceled. Even the theme song is bad. The title, even worse.<br /><br />It's as though this show is written by a couple of 15 year olds that based the character on themselves and think they're hot stuff when they're really just arrogant

{"value":"The director, outfitted in chains and leather, warned the audience at the SF Frameline Film Festival Friday night that we were about to see an \"experiental\" film. Experimental? Leave the video camera on the back seat of the car, let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight. A meandering pastiche road show manquÃ© that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place. The gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the Castro theater. I would have left, too, but my cine-buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end. By the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably. Tepid applause. Pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product.

{"value":"This is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it, there is a sense of deja vu, don't be surprised. All they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant. And it doesn't get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with. It never works. And like its predecessors, the acting is mediocre.<br /><br />The plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending doesn't fit the story. Had this movie ended ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and have been very satisfying and I would have thought it more worthwhile. But here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught.

{"value":"I sat through this film and i have to say it only just managed to keep my attention. The film would have been a bit more bearable if i did not have to watch the awful CGI, for future reference to the industry if your going to use CGI watch this so you know what to avoid.<br /><br />Apparently this is supposed to be a graphic novel for the screen but all i saw was a bad movie which bears no resemblance to a graphic novel whatsoever.<br /><br />All in all, the story was not as bad as the CGI, i was quite impressed with the acting and thought the casting was good and little more character info would have been nice as it did get a little confusing for me on occasion but that's not surprising as like i said it only just kept my attention, but in all honestly i wish i had given this one a miss.","finished_norm":["i","sit","through","thi","film","and","i","have","to","sai","it","onli","just","manag","to","keep","my","attent","the","film","would","have","be","a","bite","much","bearabl","if","i","do","not","have","to","watch","the","aw","cgi","for","futur","refer","to","the","industri","if","your","go","to","us","cgi","watch","thi","so","you","know","what","to","avoidbr","br","appar","thi","be","suppos","to","be","a","graphic","novel","for","the","screen","but","all","i","see","be","a","bad","movi","which","bear","no","resembl","to","a","graphic","novel","whatsoeverbr","br","all","in","all","the","stori","be","not","a","bad","a","the","cgi","i","be","quit","impress","with","the","act","and","think","the","cast","be","good","and","littl","much","charact","info","would","have","be","nice","a","it","do","get","a","littl","confus","for","me","on","occas","but","that","not","surpris","a","like","i","sai","it","onli","just","keep","my","attent","but","in","all","honestli","i","wish","i","have","give","thi","on","a","miss"],"filtered":["sit","thi","film","sai","onli","manag","keep","attent","film","bite","much","bearabl","watch","aw","cgi","futur","refer","industri","go","us","cgi","watch","thi","know","avoidbr","br","appar","thi","suppos","graphic","novel","screen","see","bad","movi","bear","resembl","graphic","novel","whatsoeverbr","br","stori","bad","cgi","quit","impress","act","think","cast","good","littl","much","charact","info","nice","get","littl","confus","occas","surpris","like","sai","onli","keep","attent","honestli","wish","give","thi","miss"],"filtered2":["sit","onli","manag","keep","attent","bite","bearabl","watch","aw","cgi","futur","refer","industri","go","us","cgi","watch","know","avoidbr","appar","suppos","graphic","novel","screen","see","bad","bear","resembl","graphic","novel","whatsoeverbr","stori","bad","cgi","quit","impress","act","think","cast","good","littl","charact","info","nice","get","littl","confus","occas","surpris","like","onli","keep","attent","honestli","wish","give","miss"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,9,10,11,12,14,17,21,26,30,56,92,120,134,138,149,154,192,244,255,262,308,326,345,399,418,427,474,525,636,715,757,844,1012,1053,1083,1146,2418,4269,4756,4989,8422],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,9,10,11,12,14,17,21,26,30,56,92,120,134,138,149,154,192,244,255,262,308,326,345,399,418,427,474,525,636,715,757,844,1012,1053,1083,1146,2418,4269,4756,4989,8422],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,1.982619630677639,1.066728610262888,2.2350163994518417,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.8610609350701788,2.0489535369135887,2.2044500422972613,4.488792363340481,2.2907365189289424,2.3253197803590226,2.348499626138016,2.5318267134339894,2.634508058031767,2.6754694156628323,2.726701583487816,2.8753661172782943,2.942840385588056,3.0022328381570844,3.129115117668582,3.164467636384302,3.233054746047873,7.293333077447711,3.4149707055943286,7.061861173378394,3.68099128126493,3.7165362186843414,3.8690435127678695,12.893296449120903,4.067587905068712,4.191816905030921,8.595530966080602,5.129498826886393,5.907203395474402,6.101359409915359,6.101359409915359,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612997E-4,2.1169300653874447E-4,2.117452751773489E-4,2.1170270760391557E-4,2.1172274275403071E-4,2.1169183932737045E-4,2.1175767842838516E-4,2.1166034303434351E-4,2.1169305127789731E-4,2.1191181310725417E-4,2.135932716651466E-4,2.116934009400757E-4,2.1189388796841993E-4,2.119159636557948E-4,2.118196957667696E-4,2.1170354147024005E-4,2.1177637567609532E-4,2.1187603835847075E-4,2.11714470811286E-4,2.1171369676217512E-4,2.1190416541618488E-4,2.1173490831315602E-4,2.117352287555902E-4,2.1187086861014455E-4,2.1171454718202663E-4,2.119184965746199E-4,2.1176752792775885E-4,2.1169253209079146E-4,2.1178850443817656E-4,2.1185314534259413E-4,2.1173594690714984E-4,2.118493480694336E-4,2.1195336081055485E-4,2.1215008639459382E-4,2.1176716198751698E-4,2.1170341306868612E-4,2.1177974410483197E-4,2.1172491352726213E-4,2.1166056894252492E-4,2.1171440524675968E-4,2.1192657926066694E-4,2.118103241917793E-4,2.1184983083759706E-4,2.1167110326541532E-4,2.1171445908036964E-4,2.1170333346011978E-4,2.117749931190511E-4,2.1181171516755474E-4,2.1176864445217797E-4,2.1173507874789016E-4,2.11703856986196E-4,2.121376038089872E-4,2.117571277748943E-4,2.1171441055568442E-4,2.1175599373704466E-4,2.1169274868102964E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.117257762850267E-4,2.117041541913149E-4,2.1169262784141013E-4,2.1186198702179457E-4,2.1177694030929733E-4,2.1169253934833328E-4,2.116710170258214E-4,2.11

{"value":"There were some scary scenes, which I've always liked more than straight out gore, but otherwise this movie was rather weak. THere were too many questions left unanswered, and when they tried to explain anything in the movie, it was still rather unclear. After watching this movie I still seemed lost in a lot of ways. It sort of reminded me of Silent Hill a few years back. That movie was also unsatisfying, but still better than this because it did try to work and the story did actually make sense. This one, not so much.<br /><br />The acting for the most part in the Abandoned was decent, but the movie dragged on an on, and never really gave any type of satisfying conclusion. Like I said above, there were some creepy scenes, but otherwise, this movie was a mess.

{"value":"This is one of those movies that's trying to be moody and tense, and instead, ends up tripping all over itself. Having seen it at a queer film festival, I was intrigued by the \"young college threesome gone wrong\" write-up, however, over-all ended up quite disappointed.<br /><br />It's hard to critique a \"true story\" since there's not much that can be done about the plot - but I found this disjointed, melodramatic and wholly depressing. It's dark and almost sinister, painting a darn creepy flash of the seventies with imposing music and jerky close-ups. It just doesn't work - some scenes where so cheesy that instead of hushed awe, my audience was supressing snickers and rolling eyes.<br /><br />The story has an interesting premise, but this just

{"value":"I guess if you are into the sci-fi and horror stuff it might be interesting. The acting was okay but not great. The two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twenty-one at the time. The plot is okay, but the story does jump around a bit, leaving one guessing whether you're in Boston or Pennsylvania. The priest seems to use warp speed between the two. The catholic church is portrayed as having a secretive sect for investigating events which only happen to those of that faith. What if the two girls had been protestant? Would the catholics of cared? Therefore some what contrived. Who knows, some day the catholic church might even learn what the Bible teaches.

{"value":"The movie is just as fun as staring at the sun.Sheriff Pataki is a total retard that loves nothing better to do than sit on his fat rear making a smoke ring from his puffy cigars and drinking booze while the doctor acts like a zombie version of Nicholas Cage sucking up all that so called \"Blood\" which in reality seemed like Fruit Punch.<br /><br />Most of all the plotting seemed very horrid to even call this piece of crap a movie.The rest of the characters in this movie are total wastes of time, the ending was awful, the outlines were cheesy, and the scenes were terrible. What else more should I say to you viewers out there? My advice would be to get your Rabies shot if you've already watched the movie.

{"value":"A below average looking video game is turned into some sort of conspiracy to have the next terrorist discovered in the USA backyard. Welcome to the lunacy of cheaply made direct to video movies. Its full of no-name actors and actresses with little valuable plot.<br /><br />Anyway, this strange game goes on and our \"hero\" bets real money and does good at it. It is sort of like gambling, except the gambling part is gone and it sucks. Instead its an online game with little real value and you get authorities on your tail if you do good.<br /><br />What makes it even stranger is that two strange computer programs battle it out somehow and all is saved in the end. I will leave the viewer to see how it all comes to fruition.<br /><br />Overall, not even worth a $1 rental.

{"value":"I really didn't expect much from this film seeing as it has people from Parkersburg WV, which is were I live, acting in it. This town is dull and so is this film. There were a few decent scened in the movie but I was distracted by all the crappy landmarks they made a point to show. This movie may have been good if there was actual acting in it but there wasn't any. Unless you are from Parkersburg and are interested in seeing what you see everyday, then stay away from this movie. The dialog will put you to sleep, the acting will bore you to tears and Steven Soderberg should lose some credibility after shooting crap like this. Its a predictable movie with no surprises.

{"value":"Now isn't it? Considering all the good work done by danzel,Clive and Jodie, the movie never grew into something more than a horrible die-hard/heist movies copycat. Yes a couple of jokes, no absolutely no unpredictable twists, to be honest the only unpredictable moments are there because both director and editor made some stupid mistakes, it is a shame for them and a waste of time for us. IF someone can tell me why on earth were they digging a hole inside that safe, who the hell is the Rebe and how on earth did they know that the diamonds were in the particular cell, it could just make my day, but it seems that Spike asks us to take too much things in this one for granted, and do not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid...its just another studio contract movie relax and

The story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so there comes nothing unexpected and nothing worth more than 5% of your attention to be expected.<br /><br />The directing is heavy as a direct transfer from the stage play, actors are mostly stiff as wax figures (ok this is a Hamer feature, only it's sometimes better featured in the whole package). My conclusion: this movie is trash, not worth the time I spend that evening. Eternal life is a boring matter and I should have hoped the guys in charge of programming at the CinemathÃ¨que would have known better.","finished_norm":["mimick","it","long","titl","the","movi","find","wai","to","come","close","to","the","mark","the","beauti","set","be","here","with","all","that","make","the","hamer","product","valu","a","trademark","yet","pari","drown","in","the","fog","be","a","sign","of","indol","neglect","the","stori","be","obviou","and","can","be","sum","up","in","a","dozen","word","so","there","come","noth","unexpect","and","noth","worth","much","than","of","your","attent","to","be","expectedbr","br","the","direct","be","heavi","a","a","direct","transfer","from","the","stage","plai","actor","be","mostli","stiff","a","wax","figur","okai","thi","be","a","hamer","featur","onli","it","sometim","well","featur","in","the","whole","packag","my","conclus","thi","movi","be","trash","not","worth","the","time","i","spend","that","even","etern","life","be","a","bore","matt","and","i","should","have","hope","the","gui","in","charg","of","programm","at","the","cinemathÃ¨qu","would","have","know","well"],"filtered":["mimick","long","titl","movi","find","wai","come","close","mark","beauti","set","make","hamer","product","valu","trademark","yet","pari","drown","fog","sign","indol","neglect","stori","obviou","sum","dozen","word","come","noth","unexpect","noth","worth","much","attent","expectedbr","br","direct","heavi","direct","transfer","stage","plai","actor","mostli","stiff","wax","figur","okai","thi","hamer","featur","onli","sometim","well","featur","whole","packag","conclus","thi","movi","trash","worth","time","spend","even","etern","life","bore","matt","hope","gui","charg","programm","cinemathÃ¨qu","know","well"],"filtered2":["mimick","long","titl","find","wai","come","close","mark","beauti","set","make","hamer","product","valu","trademark","yet","pari","drown","fog","sign","indol","neglect","stori","obviou","sum","dozen","word","come","noth","unexpect","noth","worth","attent","expectedbr","direct","heavi","direct","transfer","stage","plai","actor","mostli","stiff","wax","figur","okai","hamer","featur","onli","sometim","well","featur","whole","packag","conclus","trash","worth","time","spend","even","etern","life","bore","matt","hope","gui","charg","programm","cinemathÃ¨qu","know","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,8,11,17,20,26,33,34,38,40,41,49,55,75,99,102,108,109,111,181,190,191,194,219,258,264,283,295,305,325,383,408,415,451,500,510,636,669,671,717,876,956,1148,1177,1323,1522,1886,2136,2187,2351,2374,2650,2733,2812,3424,4179,4266,5066],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,8,11,17,20,26,33,34,38,40,41,49,55,75,99,102,108,109,111,181,190,191,194,219,258,264,283,295,305,325,383,408,415,451,500,510,636,669,671,717,876,956,1148,1177,1323,1522,1886,2136,2187,2351,2374,2650,2733,2812,3424,4179,4266,5066],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.2770536940105968,2.330690080046114,1.3324924169710188,1.4018535447685214,2.7965700178917925,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,3.3840606616174704,1.9536997889255368,1.9742250248702675,2.056430207256609,4.175107420354542,2.138507503627933,2.125691139326857,2.1183455303375887,2.4442286541160034,2.558331832813986,2.5460113484259455,2.5378812223426954,5.158418835671083,2.7061321952397077,2.757740698455715,2.7678802023081546,2.7910771187233068,5.7225627547931115,2.973659465713028,3.0433232530252132,3.130944944345658,3.1588018988486244,3.216957819005698,3.3814747511661465,3.374440724508766,3.530930586689197,3.7099788181381825,3.6466665387238555,3.7398317812878634,3.8844878351953436,3.969732115064953,4.176068548062782,4.263079925052412,4.383707912841026,4.550761997504193,5.1994574154933035,4.9676558014359795,5.064116067623542,5.143104478942172,5.259176650194926,5.259176650194926,5.339219357868463,5.339219357868463,5.604922523601468,5.9370563586240825,5.9370563586240825,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.8619294647691627E-4,1.8602795149399927E-4,1.8607388323225527E-4,1.8603647642975694E-4,1.8605408257553726E-4,1.860269257919961E-4,1.860847827485873E-4,1.8599924801951197E-4,1.860279908091051E-4,1.862202305795431E-4,1.8769783390787777E-4,1.8602829807924038E-4,1.8620447863330688E-4,1.8622387792744188E-4,1.8613928128212602E-4,1.8603720920051163E-4,1.8610121319542614E-4,1.8618879305904958E-4,1.8604681349948778E-4,1.860461332938787E-4,1.8621351007268015E-4,1.8606477321704622E-4,1.8606505480995558E-4,1.861842500762341E-4,1.860468806112581E-4,1.862261037624283E-4,1.8609343812280905E-4,1.8602753456675998E-4,1.8611187150105948E-4,1.8616867552698427E-4,1.8606568589487276E-4,1.8616533862436826E-4,1.8625674115804863E-4,1.8642961629456632E-4,1.8609311654811618E-4,1.860370963659951E-4,1.8610417324549052E-4,1.8605599017042668E-4,1.8599944

{"value":"If this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic, it might (i say might) have been a hit. Have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults? Well this is it. Every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards. It would be hard to find another film, with this kind of production budget, that contains so little of any value whatsoever. The whole thing, from the opening scenes defies logic. Dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical. Ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself. What is really mind boggling, is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash.

{"value":"This movie is so bad that I cannot even begin to describe it. What in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers, producers and director? How on earth did they get funding for this abomination? The plot is laughable, the acting is poor at best, the story... What story? The first fight in this movie is OK but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off.<br /><br />I guess I'm the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute.<br /><br />*** SPOLER ALERT ***<br /><br />I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it... and he is in it... for 30 seconds...<br /><br />I give it 1 out of 10 because it's the lowest

{"value":"I've probably been spoilt by having firstly seen the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack so the 1983 adaptation is such a disappointment. I just didn't get any chemistry between the 2 main stars. A lot of staring and theatrical acting just doesn't do it for me, and what was all that about putting Tim in the role of Rochester. Had the casting director actually ever read the book. Very strange! He's a fine actor but Mr. Rochester he definitely isn't! And Zelah was just, well, strange, bit of a mix matched couple. In it's favour the supporting cast were pretty good and the Lowood scenes for me were the best of the adaptation, but overall didn't capture any of the magic of the novel. Certainly wouldn't ask anyone to watch it as a true adaptation of the novel.

{"value":"This movie is a lot like the movie Hostel, except with *BAD* acting and not much suspense. The gore elements are there, but you don't really feel anything for the characters, making the violence not very effective. Some parts are just strange... like forcing a snake down someones throat. What's up with that? Is that supposed to be scary or gory? It's just kind of stupid. As for torture, there really isn't any (except for the guy getting blow-torched in the beginning, which they don't show anyway). The main bad guy keeps saying \"make them die slowly\", yet the butcher kills them all very fast. The deaths are all relatively quick. Yes, I did watch the \"unrated\" version. So, overall, not the worst gore movie I've seen, but not at all good either.
