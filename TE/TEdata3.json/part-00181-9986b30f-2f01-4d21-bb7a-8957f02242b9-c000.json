{"value":"With the exception of FAMILY, this new season is worse than Season One. I can't imagine what they are thinking. As a fan of horror, can tolerate a lot of gore and mindless mayhem, but this series gets worse with each outing. I can't imagine how disheartening it must be for the actors and crew to go to work each day, toiling to churn out such crap. STORY! Is that too much to ask for? CHARACTER! How can we give damn about the fate of ANYONE in these stories? If we are not engaged, who cares if they get carved up or whatever? Almost every episode ends with mindless blood letting, going for gross out shock without any sense of revelation or conclusion or REASON why we have been subjected to an hour of bloodletting. Even Dante's effort this season had some disturbing sexist violence and wandered off to a pointless conclusion. Ironically, the production values and performances tend to be up to speed, while the content is utter crap. I have great hopes for Exec Producer's Garris's VALARIE UNDER THE STAIRS, but we shall see.","finished_norm":["with","the","except","of","famili","thi","new","season","be","wrong","than","season","on","i","ca","not","imagin","what","thei","be","think","a","a","fan","of","horror","can","toler","a","lot","of","gore","and","mindless","mayhem","but","thi","seri","get","wrong","with","each","out","i","ca","not","imagin","how","dishearten","it","must","be","for","the","actor","and","crow","to","go","to","work","each","dai","toil","to","churn","out","such","crap","stori","be","that","too","much","to","ask","for","charact","how","can","we","give","damn","about","the","fate","of","anyon","in","thi","stori","if","we","be","not","engag","who","care","if","thei","get","carv","up","or","whatev","almost","everi","episod","end","with","mindless","blood","let","go","for","gross","out","shock","without","ani","sens","of","revel","or","conclus","or","reason","why","we","have","be","subject","to","a","hour","of","bloodlet","even","dant","effort","thi","season","have","some","disturb","sexist","violenc","and","wander","off","to","a","pointless","conclus","iron","the","product","valu","and","perform","tend","to","be","up","to","spe","while","the","content","be","utter","crap","i","have","great","hope","for","exec","produc","garri","valari","under","the","stair","but","we","shall","see"],"filtered":["except","famili","thi","new","season","wrong","season","ca","imagin","thei","think","fan","horror","toler","lot","gore","mindless","mayhem","thi","seri","get","wrong","ca","imagin","dishearten","must","actor","crow","go","work","dai","toil","churn","crap","stori","much","ask","charact","give","damn","fate","anyon","thi","stori","engag","care","thei","get","carv","whatev","almost","everi","episod","end","mindless","blood","let","go","gross","shock","without","ani","sens","revel","conclus","reason","subject","hour","bloodlet","even","dant","effort","thi","season","disturb","sexist","violenc","wander","pointless","conclus","iron","product","valu","perform","tend","spe","content","utter","crap","great","hope","exec","produc","garri","valari","stair","shall","see"],"filtered2":["except","famili","new","season","wrong","season","ca","imagin","think","fan","horror","toler","lot","gore","mindless","mayhem","get","wrong","ca","imagin","dishearten","must","actor","crow","go","work","dai","toil","churn","crap","stori","ask","charact","give","damn","fate","anyon","stori","engag","care","get","carv","whatev","almost","everi","end","mindless","blood","let","go","gross","shock","without","ani","sens","revel","conclus","reason","subject","hour","bloodlet","even","dant","effort","season","disturb","sexist","violenc","wander","pointless","conclus","iron","product","valu","perform","tend","spe","content","utter","crap","great","hope","exec","produc","garri","valari","stair","shall","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,6,10,12,17,24,25,27,30,41,48,51,72,81,83,85,87,95,105,124,125,131,132,140,141,158,173,174,181,182,190,205,233,261,306,313,340,355,358,401,451,452,508,534,550,556,769,817,839,889,943,957,1024,1142,1242,1246,1433,1655,1673,1697,1709,1817,2119,3109,3685,4159,4347,4830,5031,5777,6274],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,6,10,12,17,24,25,27,30,41,48,51,72,81,83,85,87,95,105,124,125,131,132,140,141,158,173,174,181,182,190,205,233,261,306,313,340,355,358,401,451,452,508,534,550,556,769,817,839,889,943,957,1024,1142,1242,1246,1433,1655,1673,1697,1709,1817,2119,3109,3685,4159,4347,4830,5031,5777,6274],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,1.9416538289407692,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,2.5541073880211935,1.3210361566119257,2.559277576165403,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.5687599167621034,1.6955116224012472,1.7139899308309823,1.9209463754160525,3.899514464849456,2.292318797740072,2.011190219103739,2.115024371522662,2.0323326556775485,2.1765612129984904,2.2323930368088845,2.2242236634876535,2.2512118082053005,2.253494045787767,2.317169775997098,2.2657547357741192,2.3106972614914807,2.4368824319140248,2.456282578459816,2.4442286541160034,2.7365296724240786,2.558331832813986,2.571852579609833,2.6102777977348763,2.7085302779237206,2.8739486825973213,5.814138121039546,5.897857368910622,3.185521045582134,3.2030824725120812,3.0879275592619675,3.216957819005698,3.41740676039221,3.4149707055943286,3.4272107604888307,3.4751392270607813,3.4471119148061256,3.857614816944247,12.591365871781843,3.965503778955432,3.9571003681590526,3.9911462095687695,7.939464230129906,4.072271754381138,4.263079925052412,4.364659717870332,4.315570107673808,4.535724120139652,4.760735085628657,4.654440426979034,4.6973654716960676,4.733083554298147,9.617182213612585,4.956227105612356,5.463

{"value":"Unreal \"movie\", what were these people on?? A mix of French Upstairs Downstairs, mating horses,porn (not suggested, its pretty full on for a film) & bestiality with a bit of Benny Hill music & chase scenes thrown in, its sounds crazy & its even more so to watch. **spoiler** It plods along in a tedious fashion for quite a while,.... then a Lamb does a runner, prompting woman in period dress to run off after it, she goes into the woods where she is set upon by an erect \"penis\" attached to a man in a bear/rat manky suit, I put it like that as its obvious the \"penis\" is in charge & gets way too much screen time, ejaculating for the most of it, anyway, in a nutshell, it turns out she liked a bit of bear/rat tadger & thats about it, the rest is just padding. **end spoiler** A film made to shock & offend, thus getting talked about, any publicity is good publicity I suppose,a waste of time really, but the \"main event\" has to be seen to be believed, its hard to imagine that anyone thought it was a good idea as they filmed it.","finished_norm":["unreal","movi","what","be","thi","peopl","on","a","mix","of","french","upstair","downstair","mate","horsesporn","not","suggest","it","pretti","full","on","for","a","film","bestial","with","a","bite","of","benni","hill","music","chase","scene","throw","in","it","sound","crazi","it","even","much","so","to","watch","spoiler","it","plod","along","in","a","tediou","fashion","for","quit","a","while","then","a","lamb","doe","a","runner","prompt","woman","in","period","dress","to","run","off","after","it","she","go","into","the","wood","where","she","be","set","upon","by","a","erect","peni","attach","to","a","man","in","a","bearrat","manki","suit","i","put","it","like","that","a","it","obviou","the","peni","be","in","charg","get","wai","too","much","screen","time","ejacul","for","the","much","of","it","anywai","in","a","nutshel","it","turn","out","she","like","a","bite","of","bearrat","tadger","that","about","it","the","rest","be","just","pad","end","spoiler","a","film","make","to","shock","offend","thu","get","talk","about","ani","public","be","good","public","i","supposea","wast","of","time","realli","but","the","main","event","have","to","be","see","to","be","believ","it","hard","to","imagin","that","anyon","think","it","be","a","good","idea","a","thei","film","it"],"filtered":["unreal","movi","thi","peopl","mix","french","upstair","downstair","mate","horsesporn","suggest","pretti","full","film","bestial","bite","benni","hill","music","chase","scene","throw","sound","crazi","even","much","watch","spoiler","plod","along","tediou","fashion","quit","lamb","doe","runner","prompt","woman","period","dress","run","go","wood","set","upon","erect","peni","attach","man","bearrat","manki","suit","put","like","obviou","peni","charg","get","wai","much","screen","time","ejacul","much","anywai","nutshel","turn","like","bite","bearrat","tadger","rest","pad","end","spoiler","film","make","shock","offend","thu","get","talk","ani","public","good","public","supposea","wast","time","realli","main","event","see","believ","hard","imagin","anyon","think","good","idea","thei","film"],"filtered2":["unreal","peopl","mix","french","upstair","downstair","mate","horsesporn","suggest","pretti","full","bestial","bite","benni","hill","music","chase","scene","throw","sound","crazi","even","watch","spoiler","plod","along","tediou","fashion","quit","lamb","doe","runner","prompt","woman","period","dress","run","go","wood","set","upon","erect","peni","attach","man","bearrat","manki","suit","put","like","obviou","peni","charg","get","wai","screen","time","ejacul","anywai","nutshel","turn","like","bite","bearrat","tadger","rest","pad","end","spoiler","make","shock","offend","thu","get","talk","ani","public","good","public","supposea","wast","time","realli","main","event","see","believ","hard","imagin","anyon","think","good","idea"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,13,18,19,23,24,27,33,45,70,78,89,91,96,109,118,120,123,137,154,158,159,171,178,179,186,192,226,310,324,336,340,383,386,470,490,508,530,630,646,655,712,743,780,783,873,888,899,1018,1037,1192,1235,1522,1629,1949,1975,2073,2440,3025,4579,4591,4725,4875,5697,6034,6698,6851,7162],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,12,13,18,19,23,24,27,33,45,70,78,89,91,96,109,118,120,123,137,154,158,159,171,178,179,186,192,226,310,324,336,340,383,386,470,490,508,530,630,646,655,712,743,780,783,873,888,899,1018,1037,1192,1235,1522,1629,1949,1975,2073,2440,3025,4579,4591,4725,4875,5697,6034,6698,6851,7162],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3002700588679295,1.4018535447685214,1.8162961064622165,2.094675786251684,2.0064197866819473,1.9940046109572438,2.0105926690411424,2.0390708128715254,2.125691139326857,2.354379525480895,2.2044500422972613,2.2619070973220485,2.2939035841256437,4.696999252276032,2.3106972614914807,2.300267965194495,2.373087554090762,2.532833256045391,2.507968722980095,2.571852579609833,2.5318267134339894,2.5940874818617203,2.854312708080462,2.8753661172782943,2.9233055795674137,2.948928684455311,3.0433232530252132,3.0433232530252132,3.3814747511661465,6.698129014030783,3.4149707055943286,3.5784919978881358,3.558633189238533,3.5900195030592035,3.7297814454343623,3.7165362186843414,3.7568101178222815,7.555144218541421,3.7568101178222815,3.892300374932137,3.9323057095458362,4.197121957260614,4.268777946167049,4.062925891962901,4.268777946167049,4.29776

{"value":"Alicianne (Laurel Barnett) becomes a live in babysitter for young Rosalie Nordon (Rosalione Cole) who has recently lost her mother. But Rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave (conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house) late at night...where she also meets her \"friends\"...<br /><br />This starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemetery...then falls apart. The story is thin and there is TONS of padding to make the film 85 minutes long. The acting is terrible across the board (with Cole easily being the worst). Badly directed with some of the WORST editing I've ever seen in a motion picture. Scenes (and sound) are just cut off with no rhyme or reason. Also the film has terrible (and obvious) post-production sound.<br /><br />As for blood and violence--forget it! There's very little and what there is looks incredibly fake. I've NEVER seen such fake-looking blood--looks like ketchup! Boring, pointless--a rightfully forgotten drive-in movie.

{"value":"I actually didn't mind the Geico commercials the first 50 of so times I saw them and even found them to be a bit wry and amusing, BUT SERIOUSLY! This is the BEST thing that these people could come up with?!? This show sucks! It is bland and feels like watching an episode of \"The Office\" with the characters disguised as cavemen (I know a lot of you will hate me for saying that but \"The Office\" just does not do it for me). Okay, I get it: we have the poor slob just trying to keep his nose clean and he has a crappy boss who hates him; the pseudo-intellectual who really just has a barely-functioning intellect; and the dopey one who just wants to be accepted, but SO WHAT!!! I have worked with these people and found them just as annoying in real life as I do on TV...why would I want to waste another 1/336th of my week watching more of those type nominates?!? Please call your parents and ask them if they dropped you on your head if after thinking about it, you still delude yourself into believing that this is entertainment.","finished_norm":["i","actual","do","not","mind","the","geico","commerci","the","of","so","time","i","see","them","and","even","find","them","to","be","a","bite","wry","and","amus","but","serious","thi","be","the","well","thing","that","thi","peopl","can","come","up","with","thi","show","suck","it","be","bland","and","feel","like","watch","a","episod","of","the","offic","with","the","charact","disguis","a","caveman","i","know","a","lot","of","you","will","hate","me","for","sai","that","but","the","offic","just","doe","not","do","it","for","me","okai","i","get","it","we","have","the","poor","slob","just","try","to","keep","hi","nose","clean","and","he","have","a","crappi","boss","who","hate","him","the","pseudointellectu","who","realli","just","have","a","barelyfunct","intellect","and","the","dopei","on","who","just","want","to","be","accept","but","so","what","i","have","work","with","thi","peopl","and","find","them","just","a","annoi","in","real","life","a","i","do","on","tvwhy","would","i","want","to","wast","anoth","th","of","my","week","watch","much","of","that","typ","nomin","pleas","call","your","parent","and","ask","them","if","thei","drop","you","on","your","head","if","after","think","about","it","you","still","delud","yourself","into","believ","that","thi","be","entertain"],"filtered":["actual","mind","geico","commerci","time","see","even","find","bite","wry","amus","serious","thi","well","thing","thi","peopl","come","thi","show","suck","bland","feel","like","watch","episod","offic","charact","disguis","caveman","know","lot","hate","sai","offic","doe","okai","get","poor","slob","try","keep","hi","nose","clean","crappi","boss","hate","pseudointellectu","realli","barelyfunct","intellect","dopei","want","accept","work","thi","peopl","find","annoi","real","life","tvwhy","want","wast","anoth","th","week","watch","much","typ","nomin","pleas","call","parent","ask","thei","drop","head","think","still","delud","believ","thi","entertain"],"filtered2":["actual","mind","geico","commerci","time","see","even","find","bite","wry","amus","serious","well","thing","peopl","come","show","suck","bland","feel","like","watch","offic","charact","disguis","caveman","know","lot","hate","offic","doe","okai","get","poor","slob","try","keep","nose","clean","crappi","boss","hate","pseudointellectu","realli","barelyfunct","intellect","dopei","want","accept","work","peopl","find","annoi","real","life","tvwhy","want","wast","anoth","th","week","watch","typ","nomin","pleas","call","parent","ask","drop","head","think","still","delud","believ","entertain"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,7,8,10,12,13,18,20,23,26,28,29,34,36,37,38,43,48,52,64,72,73,75,80,89,91,134,142,146,154,191,195,208,238,271,306,339,346,371,384,421,587,670,708,742,853,857,904,1028,1077,1125,1249,1495,1795,1957,2276,3917,5386,6163,6867,7110],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,7,8,10,12,13,18,20,23,26,28,29,34,36,37,38,43,48,52,64,72,73,75,80,89,91,134,142,146,154,191,195,208,238,271,306,339,346,371,384,421,587,670,708,742,853,857,904,1028,1077,1125,1249,1495,1795,1957,2276,3917,5386,6163,6867,7110],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,2.729695454751562,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,2.975308642954861,3.038623282696244,1.6608112036218214,1.6955116224012472,1.7122153074726136,1.883428577602134,1.9209463754160525,1.8950689206770979,1.9742250248702675,1.9951803900462557,1.9940046109572438,2.0105926690411424,2.2443961816702407,2.2844323215331563,2.326138445979858,2.348499626138016,2.5460113484259455,2.51289241584188,2.6289494000279396,2.597304642813496,2.757740698455715,2.8739486825973213,6.007688884102852,3.023389038124396,3.0466846007279185,3.109204957709252,3.2597778161886266,7.221036049215089,3.7264536553416874,3.6683728173057184,3.7165362186843414,3.8962296530720266,3.9612932464190886,3.9121030022283168,4.086456389373095,4.235066888824737,4.240607069200353,4.499089986959872,4.5432147918688095,4.8796870284900224,4.911775343041523,5.064116067623542,6.489124940924123,6.214688095222362,6.437831646536572,6.725513718988353,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.510042317798045E-5,6.466143580525478E-5,6.51641168107838E-5,6.47875978496345E-5,6.478865932148257E-5,6.469809772299912E-5,6.489051893066973E-5,6.467074662950027E-5,6.48161500432067E-5,7.190998029871791E-5,0.7312139648775865,6.456635378611557E-5,6.57714527612675E-5,6.67096969872648E-5,6.461343489774668E-5,6.443487124176149E-5,6.6042118

{"value":"well, i hated knocked up, i despised 40-year-old virgin, and this little gem is a worthless piece of trash movie. do yourself a favor, and skip it. i admit, i don't like the actors in this movie, and after my 18-year-old son showed me the cover of the DVD, i was like, \"i wouldn't like that movie,\" but at his insistence, i decided to give it a try, unfortunately. <br /><br />about two minutes into the movie i turned it off, i was so offended. it's just disgusting. any decent person would be offended by the filth in this movie. call me old fashioned, but shoving your pussy juice-covered hand into your friend's face so he will know you \"got some\" is over the line of decency, in my opinion. yeah, that's how this putrid little film starts, and i can only imagine it gets much worse from there. another real winner for Mr. Rudd. i bet he's proud as punch. imagine if you could only get worthless roles like he gets, would you stay in movies? despite the pay, i wouldn't.

{"value":"My husband and I were intrigued by the spectacle - a strong willed Southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the LAPD. The first season was must-see TV for us. Unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching.<br /><br />My husband and I were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked up. But the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss. Why would a strong, middle aged woman do those things? The answer is she wouldn't. Additionally, my husband and I pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. It is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family. Can't the script writers do something original from time to time? As I mentioned, we are no longer viewers.

{"value":"I can't believe anyone liked this movie. I've seen a lot of low-budget indie films, but this one absolutely sucked. Low budget doesn't mean the movie has to be demented. Horror doesn't mean the movie has to be demented. There was nothing scary about this movie at all. It was just a gore-fest, and a particularly disturbing one at that. The acting was average, considering they were all unheard of actors, but the story was pathetic, the dialog was pathetic. The movie tries to come off as \"artistic\", or something. This is not one of those really great indie films that cost only thousands of dollars to make, but are incredibly well done. This was nothing more than an excuse for some extremely sick people to put their perverse obsessions on film. Other reviews here also said that the soundtrack sucked...that's because most of it was written by the same person, and some of the songs were written by one of the writers of the movie. There were no redeeming qualities to this movie at all.

{"value":"I think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made, When I saw the trailer on TV i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of **** and it would be best to avoid it, but I somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends, I walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film. The so-called \"jokes\" in this film bring a cringe to the face, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies. The film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull. The characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped. I never want to have to see this **** film again, I'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again.

{"value":"Ladies and Gentlemen,please don't get fooled by \"A Stanley Kubrick\" film tag.This is a very bad film which unfortunately has been hailed as one of the deadliest horror films ever made.Horror films should create such a fear that during nights people should shiver their hearts out while thinking about a true horror film.In Shining,there is no real horror at all but what we find instead is just a naive,foolish attempt made to create chilling horror.Everyone knows as to how good the attempts are if they are different from reality.All that is good in the film is the view of the icy valley. The hotel where most of the actors were lodged appears good too.A word about the actors Jack Nicholson looks like a lost,lazy soul who is never really sure of what he is supposed to do.There is not much to be said of a bald,colored actor who for the most of times is busy pampering a kid actor.No need to blame the bad weather for the tragedy.It cannot be avoided as the film has been made and poor

{"value":"(spoilers)The one truly memorable part of this otherwise rather dull and tepid bit of British cuisine is Steiner's henna rinse, one of the worst dye jobs ever. That, and the magnificent caterpillar eyebrows on the old evil dude who was trying to steal Steiner's invention. MST3K does an admirable job of making a wretchedly boring and grey film funny.I particularly like it when Crow kills Mike with his 'touch of death', and when he revives him in the theatre, Mike cries \"Guys, I died, I saw eternal truth and beauty! oh, it's this movie...\" That would be a letdown, having to come back from the afterlife to watch the rest of The Projected Man. The film could make a fortune being sold as a sleep aide. Some of the puns in the film were wicked: police inspector-\"electrocution!\" Crow-\"Shocking, isn't it?\" police inspector-\"That's LOwe, all right\" Tom Servo-\"Very low, right down by the floor!\"

{"value":"I saw this film first in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee. But then, in Poland in 2000, I watched it in a complete form. And so what? The plot is incredibly unwise - 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong, straight and fundamentally severe ladies. The men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow - sex-drive, constant masculine desire for sex, feminists who are shown like complete idiots (you may agree with them or not, but idiots certainly they are not), and so on. The performance even of the stellar Jerzy Stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad - he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like \"I am in the elevator with a nude chick and I haven't done anything to her!\". This was intended to be a comedy, instead, it turned out to be a vapid farce, full of predictable jokes and below-the-waist innuendos.

{"value":"The plot is so manipulative, counting completely on the most uncredible and unthinkable decisions of the adults in each and every parenting decision. The children are super as far as charm and delivery of the lines but as I say, the whole plot depends on each and every adult being complete idiots, and therefore in THAT case, making more sense out of their actions (and at the same time being the only way to explain the boys actions of total mistrust). Why would sweey charming little boys take a baby from the shore? How did the baby get to the shore and at the same time account for it being the LAST place to be searched? Why would the 2 boys NEVER be informed an instead at the same time a baby is missing nobody gives a fig about them running around with food and diapers with all that commotion going on and literally every other place it searched? There is just no possible justification to ask the audience to believe this.

{"value":"This movie is so bad it's good -- in an unintentionally funny way. I couldn't stop watching it, I was laughing so much! It's like a parody of a romantic thriller, except it's not a parody. <br /><br />Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell, an oppressed preacher's wife who falls hard for Luke (Corey Sevier), a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison; the only thing Sevier is guilty of, though, is bad acting! Mind you, he's no worse than the other actors. You get the sense that the actors have *no* idea they're in a really awful film; they're playing it straight. Everything about the film is bad: the acting, the script, the love scenes, the pacing, the plot twists, the choice of music. The climactic scenes are just so ludicrous -- first the shootout in the church, then Luke's final words to Emily -- I was howling with laughter. <br /><br />Evidently Luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison, and we get to see plenty of his naked torso.

{"value":"Payback is the game being played in this drama and the revenge plot is undone by the absurd story line that sets the stage for the fireworks that come later. Why would a man become involved with the trophy wife of a ruthless mob boss in the gangster's own mansion with suspicious henchmen all around? Why would an unhappy wife encourage the attentions of a complete stranger and expect him to carry her away with him and leave her husband and boredom behind to live happily ever after with her new love? Surely the hero, here Kevin Costner, must have expected a reaction from the cuckold husband that gives the movie an excuse to indulge in senseless gore and violence. Anthony Quinn, great actor that he was, surely deserved better, and Madeleine Stowe is the tragic figure who suffers greatly as she latches on to her prince charming. Stowe is okay but her Spanish accent doesn't work. The cameos of the lesser players are good, especially Miguel Ferrer and John Leguizamo and Sally Kirkland is interesting as a fading rock

{"value":"The plot sounded like it had promise. To be honest I did not watch the entire movie. After about an hour into the movie I had to make a decision. Is this movie worth watching until it conclusion? The answer was clearly NO! It was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it. Nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human / wolf transplant. It was because the movie was badly written, acting lacked emotion and I did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes. When he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the zoo gate the saying \"If you can't run with the big dogs don't leave the porch\" kept running through my bored mind. Save yourself the time and skip this movie. I can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack jawed as I did wondering why anyone waste money, time, energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to American

{"value":"I don't know why this has the fans it does and I don't know why I have even given it the score I have. This is preposterous. There are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief, let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen. But, this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack, even by Italian standards. Not a giallo, this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring Klaus Kinski in one his most blatant 'phoned in' performances. I reckon he turned up, did a day's work and cleared off leaving Mr D'Amato to get others to fill in. Ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough, and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place, long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle.

{"value":"I saw this movie in its own time period, when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life, but stamped your child as a bastard. In these days of 'single mothers' that may seem very far-fetched, but it was very true. And I'm not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering, either. Between these two problems I had difficulty finding this movie funny. At that time I didn't know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had. I did know who Betty Hutton was, and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic. I loved \"Bringing Up Baby\", but I find this movie just embarrassing. I'm sure the punch at some church functions probably was spiked, but I was the one needing a drink after watching this again. The idea the girl would have to be drunk in order to 'get married' and get pregnant just added to the misery. An entire town could turn on you under these circumstances, so the outcome of this movie is really the funny part.

{"value":"I have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'Goodnight Mister Tom' for absolutely ages and it was only recently when I got the chance to watch this adaption of it. I have heard lots of positive remarks about this, so I had high hopes. Once this film had finished, I was horrified.<br /><br />This film is not a good film at all. 'Goodnight Mister Tom' was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4.5/10 of the book was missed out. Particularly, I found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this. There was not much dialogue, It was rushed and far too fast-moving, but I was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between William Beech and Tom in this film which was a true let down. The casting was not all that good,either. I thought this could have been really good, but it was so different to the book! Anextremely poor adaption, one of the worst I've seen.

{"value":"You know those films that have you trapped in the cinema? You're stuck there in the best seat in the house, centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat - and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there, uncomfortable and itchy, thinking \"When the F*** is this film ever going to END???\" (You know the feeling - think of A.I. and The Village).<br /><br />Well, Visitor Q delivers a weird variant of that feeling. I sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f***ing start! It is interminable! So \"Arty\" it hurts. This is the first Miike Takashi film I have watched. Apparently he makes films by the dozen and, if they are all pretentious w@nk like this, I suspect it will be the last.<br /><br />I'm not against Pretentious w@nk.

{"value":"I have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'Goodnight Mister Tom' for absolutely ages and it was only recently when I got the chance to watch this adaption of it. I have heard lots of positive remarks about this, so I had high hopes. Once this film had finished, I was horrified.<br /><br />This film is not a good film at all. 'Goodnight Mister Tom' was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4.5/10 of the book was missed out. Particularly, I found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this. There was not much dialogue, It was rushed and far too fast-moving, but I was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between William Beech and Tom in this film which was a true let down. The casting was not all that good,either. I thought this could have been really good, but it was so different to the book! Anextremely poor adaption, one of the worst I've seen.

{"value":"I'm sorry, but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just doesn't hold up. The only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing his Halloween mask. The most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter. The film goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late, we the audience have lost all interest in the story. There is barely any character development, and people always rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really isn't much to her. I'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. Those are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can't believe Roger Ebert gave it four stars, for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high

{"value":"Mislead by the terrible lie on the cover, \"fun as American Pie\", my girlfriend and I sat in front of the TV waiting for a comedy... and this is definitely not one. You probably won't laugh one time if you're not one of those Jackass-like ever-teeny minds. It's not even an erotic movie, which would at least been something, given that it's about sex...<br /><br />So, what is this? The erratic plot deals with a guy who wants to lose virginity (zero in originality, I remember \"Losing it\" for one) and his gang of friends. The rest of the characters (i.e. the girls) just come and go for no credible reason. Come on, there are even Dwarfs (so simple: \"dwarves are fun ho ho\"...) The acting is very TV-like (as is the video look throughout the movie) and definitely amateur in the case of most of the girls...<br /><br />Awful movie. Amateurish, badly produced, and over all NOT FUNNY. Kids and teens will love to watch it with friends because of the swearing and sex jokes. Other than that, don't even think of renting this movie.","finished_norm":["mislead","by","the","terribl","lie","on","the","cover","fun","a","american","pie","my","girlfriend","and","i","sit","in","front","of","the","tv","wait","for","a","comedi","and","thi","be","definit","not","on","you","probabl","wo","not","laugh","on","time","if","you","re","not","on","of","that","jackasslik","everteeni","mind","it","not","even","a","erot","movi","which","would","at","littl","be","someth","give","that","it","about","sexbr","br","so","what","be","thi","the","errat","plot","deal","with","a","gui","who","want","to","lose","virgin","zero","in","origin","i","rememb","lose","it","for","on","and","hi","gang","of","friend","the","rest","of","the","charact","ie","the","girl","just","come","and","go","for","no","credibl","reason","come","on","there","be","even","dwarf","so","simpl","dwarf","be","fun","ho","ho","the","act","be","veri","tvlike","a","be","the","video","look","throughout","the","movi","and","definit","amateur","in","the","case","of","much","of","the","girlsbr","br","aw","movi","amateurish","badli","produc","and","over","all","not","funni","kid","and","teen","will","love","to","watch","it","with","friend","becaus","of","the","swear","and","sex","joke","other","than","that","do","not","even","think","of","rent","thi","movi"],"filtered":["mislead","terribl","lie","cover","fun","american","pie","girlfriend","sit","front","tv","wait","comedi","thi","definit","probabl","wo","laugh","time","re","jackasslik","everteeni","mind","even","erot","movi","littl","someth","give","sexbr","br","thi","errat","plot","deal","gui","want","lose","virgin","zero","origin","rememb","lose","hi","gang","friend","rest","charact","ie","girl","come","go","credibl","reason","come","even","dwarf","simpl","dwarf","fun","ho","ho","act","veri","tvlike","video","look","throughout","movi","definit","amateur","case","much","girlsbr","br","aw","movi","amateurish","badli","produc","funni","kid","teen","love","watch","friend","becaus","swear","sex","joke","even","think","rent","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["mislead","terribl","lie","cover","fun","american","pie","girlfriend","sit","front","tv","wait","comedi","definit","probabl","wo","laugh","time","re","jackasslik","everteeni","mind","even","erot","littl","someth","give","sexbr","errat","plot","deal","gui","want","lose","virgin","zero","origin","rememb","lose","gang","friend","rest","charact","ie","girl","come","go","credibl","reason","come","even","dwarf","simpl","dwarf","fun","ho","ho","act","veri","tvlike","video","look","throughout","definit","amateur","case","girlsbr","aw","amateurish","badli","produc","funni","kid","teen","love","watch","friend","becaus","swear","sex","joke","even","think","rent"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,7,8,10,12,14,15,16,21,22,30,32,34,37,53,54,55,62,68,69,84,95,114,127,133,138,148,161,166,172,214,221,223,226,238,240,244,254,259,261,288,290,331,392,406,438,448,468,491,650,661,730,737,773,881,964,997,1158,1188,1208,1416,1596,1758,2092,2194,2529,3672,3839,6483,8096,8123],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,6,7,8,10,12,14,15,16,21,22,30,32,34,37,53,54,55,62,68,69,84,95,114,127,133,138,148,161,166,172,214,221,223,226,238,240,244,254,259,261,288,290,331,392,406,438,448,468,491,650,661,730,737,773,881,964,997,1158,1188,1208,1416,1596,1758,2092,2194,2529,3672,3839,6483,8096,8123],"values":[2.7780513171783934,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,2.7965700178917925,1.4876543214774305,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,1.9536997889255368,2.0226120445069267,2.0064197866819473,2.127032521151058,2.2212694515902225,2.0323326556775485,2.4433074195966826,2.4359679371086367,2.3212364753796515,2.2907365189289424,2.3018654096236517,4.864636596042175,2.4423870329693536,2.5001408943598484,2.7303758068497004,5.284684914728755,2.825563294794476,2.5940874818617203,2.597304642813496,2.7666071276613566,2.634508058031767,2.889652074525771,5.492910624448097,2.7085302779237206,2.8015621426949333,2.8612813773965557,2.932274249550174,6.134186944718251,3.121829110937649,3.1797351085150902,3.2681460658591432,3.304513710030018,3.369778711402955,3.6621227969605474,3.5727776966246974,3.767137231978131,3.6841709341823097,3.7364704335851586,4.086456389373095,4.062925891962901,4.263079925052412,4.2860694432771105,4.213208095012239,4.297765483040301,4.484804029712395,4.646072177308517,4.956227105612356,5.259176650194926,5.089758498236879,5.185068678041204,12.511020179485236,11.700089963268907,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562,6.948657270302562]},"topic

{"value":"As others have said, \"No, Luciano\" is a more apt title or response to this movie title. For entertainment, the great opera singer should stick to singing.....not that he's a terrible actor. It's just that this movie stinks.<br /><br />The first 25 minutes were fine - a nice family movie, as it were - but after that it's nothing but a boring soap opera.<br /><br />Appropriately playing a singer, Pavarotti, as \"Giorgio Fini,\" loses his voice a few times and the doctor, \"Pamela Taylor\" (Kathryn Harrold) comes to the rescue. The singer then falls for the doctor, the doctor slowly falls for the singer, the two argue all the time and on and on and on it goes.<br /><br />Pavarotti has a winning smile and is a likable guy. It's Harrold that spoils things and after watching her here I am not surprised she didn't become a star. <br /><br />There is nice scenery in the movie to enjoy, good shots of San Francisco and Italy, at least in the first half of the film.

{"value":"Where was his critique of democratic administrations as well as republican ones? After all he did serve for 17+ years in a body of government where his influence was unwaivering. Oh I forgot about the 8 years he was the 2nd in command of the most Powerful nation on Earth. The film is happy to show shots of a young Senator Gore asking why a NASA scientist was forced to change a conclusion in his scientific paper, but fails to ask about the complicity of Clinton/Gore in global warming. Probably too close to an election year, or maybe it would hurt the chances for Hillary in '08. Either way he's a political coward and party man to the bitter end. He offers no criticism of consumerism, no criticism of capitalism, no way to is the history of the industrial development which has led us to this point in time <br /><br />In the end this film was much more about Mr. Gore himself than about any real problems our environment faces.

{"value":"Not being familiar with US television stations, when I flicked onto this on my in-laws' cable, first I thought it was just a low-budget sci-fi film, then after a couple of minutes I started thinking it might be a clever satire on the worst excesses of Christian fundamentalist, and then it dawned on me - good grief, these people are serious! It's been a while since I saw anything so unintentionally hilarious. I hesitated about writing a review of this for fear of offending believers, but then I saw other reviews and thought, hey, they can take it. Tough philosophical conundrum: how do you make a movie criticizing movies without actually showing what it is you're criticizing? Answer: make it in such a way that the only people who'll appreciate it are people who hate the kind of movies you're criticizing. I suppose some liberals (ugh! spit when you say that!) might be offended at the filmmakers' contempt for those in the audience who aren't obsessed with the J**** C***** myth, but I didn't mind - it

{"value":"This is the worst imaginable crap. The novel by H. Rider Haggard is very entertaining and dramatic. The makers of this worthless movie don't follow it closely. Well, old novels aren't sacred and making free versions of them is fine with me if one has ideas of one's own. If all one can do is changing things and replace them with uninteresting and watered-down clichés one should stick to the original. If they had done that this film would have been at least twice as good even with worse actors and if filmed inside a studio with huts made of cardboard. BUt there's no imagination at all only tiredness. This should be bought or watched only by collectors of Victorian novels made into movies.<br /><br />Just a hint, and not a spoiler I think, to make those of you who have read the novel understand what has taken place and what you may expect if you decide to watch this on TV or - God forbid - waste money on buying this.

{"value":"I've seen enough of both Little Richard in interviews and in performances and enough of poor Leon pigeonholed into these 50s/60s musical bio pics to know that Leon was not the right actor for this role. Leon was so right as David Ruffin in The Temptations, but fails utterly to capture the essence of Little Richard in this film. <br /><br />Actor Miguel Núñez who played Little Richard in \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\" was a much more suitable choice, having pulled off the musician's powerful but effeminate persona. <br /><br />If the performances are unconvincing then the film will be as well. And this is what has happened here. Glossed over or missed entirely are LR's forays into homosexuality and voyeurism. What \"The Temptations\" did so well in capturing the rise of the group, warts and all, this film misses by a wide mark.<br /><br />What is going on with director Robert Townsend who started off so well with \"The Hollywood Shuffle\"?

{"value":"1st watched 8/26/2001 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Tobe Hooper): Scary, yet sadistic(which makes sense) portrayal of a relative of the Marquis De Sade carrying out the same sadistic acts and enjoying it that supposedly his predecessor did. This Tobe Hooper film really doesn't do a whole lot different than his similar in style Freddy Krueger movies with the same star (Freddy himself - Robert Englund) playing a dual role(the Marquis De Sade and his relative). It is also seems like it wants to really poke at Christianity but then loses that in the end much to my chagrin but leaving an inconsistent feel to the movie. Could have been much worse if excesses were taken in sex and violence, but they try to keep this at a minimal despite some disgusting scenes. My final thought is why would Hooper want to make this movie. It obviously took awhile to actually get distributed, then it has to be advertised gruesomely and with Hooper's name in the title to hopefully make some money on his name and his gore.

{"value":"Generally over rated movie which boasts a strong cast and some clever dialog and of course Dean Martin songs. Problem is Nicholas Cage, there is no chemistry between he and Cher and they are the central love story. Cher almost makes up for this with her reactions to Cage's shifting accent and out of control body language. Cage simply never settles into his role. He tries everything he can think of and comes across as an actor rather than real person and that's what's needed in a love story. Cage has had these same kind of performance problems in other roles that require more of a Jimmy Stewart type character. Cage keeps taking these roles, perhaps because he likes those kind of movies but his own energy as an actor doesn't lend itself to them, though he's gotten better at it with repeated attempts. He should leave these type of roles to less interesting actors who would fully commit to the film and spend his energy and considerable talent in more off beat roles and films where he can be his

{"value":"....as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates. Barely even reaching feature length, \"Can I Do It....'Till I Need Glasses\" is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so short that you can't believe it when you realize that THAT was supposed to be the punchline (example: the Santa Claus gag); others are so long that you can't believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up THAT punchline (example: the students' awards gag). And nearly all are directed without any artistry. Don't get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite). There is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves, yet again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is some comedic male nudity as well). And I agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy!

{"value":"I went in to this movie thinking it was going to be the next Clerks, but left feeling let down. The humor was weak and the characters fairly flat. That isn't to say it was all bad, the idea of the dating service in the grocery store seemed like pretty fertile material, but the director switched focus to the cliche'd \"save the Mom-and-Pop store from the evil corporation guy\". I felt like if he would have just stuck with the dating service plot, he would have come out with a much more memorable movie. Now, to do the film justice, I am from the Rochester area and loved the way he portrayed Webster. In fact, the best Kevin Smith (of Clerks) homage here was giving props to his hometown. Webster, NY is to Checkout what Red Bank, NJ is to Clerks. The director wisely threw in a date at Nick Tahou's. Trust me, as far as things to do in Rochester, a garbage plate is at the top of the list. I was lucky enough to see this film at the Little in Rochester so everybody knew when the odes to the town came up and appreciated

{"value":"This is one of the worst films I have *ever* seen! It is bad, even at TV Movie level standards. The plot is diabolically flawed, and the known names in this film are wasted on confused, uncertain characters. I don't know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a film together - it is that bad. Billed as a 'Psychological Horror Thriller' - it is certainly Horrific. There is nothing Thrilling about it. And it could do you Psychological damage! The initial opening scenes held such promise - a possible embarkation on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain, but the utter shambles that followed the car-crash scene is beyond belief. No matter how hard you try, you couldn't care less about the characters. There are so many sprinkled ideas that the film is at best a collage of disconnected phrases from Chinese philosophers, and at worst the film would actually make you go Brain Dead!<br /><br />I have purchased over 300 films on DVD, and this is the FIRST one I'm going to get my money back on.
