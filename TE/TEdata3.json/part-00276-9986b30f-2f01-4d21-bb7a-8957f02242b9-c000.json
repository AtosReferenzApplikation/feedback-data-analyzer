{"value":"This is a truly abysmal `LOCK STOCK' clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script. I have no idea why so many top British actors signed up to this junk, they must have been bribed. A miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if I hadn't have paid good money for it I'd have turned it off after 10 minutes. Not the worst film ive ever seen, that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a Â‘movie' (I use the term loosely) `GUMMO' (I feel like suing that so called `director' for the lost hour and a half of my life) but this trash is nearly right down there with it. Definitely one of the worst 5 films I have ever seen. Stuff like this reminds Hollywood that they don't have a monopoly on truly awful films.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","truli","abysm","lock","stock","clone","with","a","stellar","cast","and","a","terribl","script","i","have","no","idea","why","so","mani","top","british","actor","sign","up","to","thi","junk","thei","must","have","be","bribe","a","miss","match","of","a","storylin","go","on","forev","and","ever","and","ever","and","if","i","have","not","have","pai","good","monei","for","it","i","have","have","turn","it","off","after","minut","not","the","wrong","film","iv","ever","see","that","honour","go","to","the","truli","pathet","us","bogrol","of","a","movi","i","us","the","term","loos","gummo","i","feel","like","sue","that","so","call","director","for","the","lose","hour","and","a","half","of","my","life","but","thi","trash","be","nearli","right","down","there","with","it","definit","on","of","the","wrong","film","i","have","ever","see","stuff","like","thi","remind","hollywood","that","thei","do","not","have","a","monopoli","on","truli","aw","film"],"filtered":["thi","truli","abysm","lock","stock","clone","stellar","cast","terribl","script","idea","mani","top","british","actor","sign","thi","junk","thei","must","bribe","miss","match","storylin","go","forev","ever","ever","pai","good","monei","turn","minut","wrong","film","iv","ever","see","honour","go","truli","pathet","us","bogrol","movi","us","term","loos","gummo","feel","like","sue","call","director","lose","hour","half","life","thi","trash","nearli","right","definit","wrong","film","ever","see","stuff","like","thi","remind","hollywood","thei","monopoli","truli","aw","film"],"filtered2":["truli","abysm","lock","stock","clone","stellar","cast","terribl","script","idea","mani","top","british","actor","sign","junk","must","bribe","miss","match","storylin","go","forev","ever","ever","pai","good","monei","turn","minut","wrong","iv","ever","see","honour","go","truli","pathet","us","bogrol","us","term","loos","gummo","feel","like","sue","call","director","lose","hour","half","life","trash","nearli","right","definit","wrong","ever","see","stuff","like","remind","hollywood","monopoli","truli","aw"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,25,41,43,44,50,56,58,59,75,77,92,96,121,123,126,138,141,142,166,174,206,221,255,300,322,343,361,364,392,515,601,611,644,671,696,858,876,919,940,1233,1318,1324,1482,2104,2693,2812,3026,5562,5631,7322],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,6,25,41,43,44,50,56,58,59,75,77,92,96,121,123,126,138,141,142,166,174,206,221,255,300,322,343,361,364,392,515,601,611,644,671,696,858,876,919,940,1233,1318,1324,1482,2104,2693,2812,3026,5562,5631,7322],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,1.9416538289407692,2.559277576165403,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,6.418917570009896,1.717994385570355,3.7221218701403576,1.865701314626681,1.8693254449200722,1.9742250248702675,1.9463902258768238,2.0489535369135887,2.0390708128715254,2.2190595059394194,2.2619070973220485,2.2391270689902285,2.2907365189289424,2.2657547357741192,2.2844323215331563,2.4423870329693536,2.456282578459816,2.597304642813496,2.6423424573643777,2.6754694156628323,2.932274249550174,2.885344817328191,8.91160338950968,3.0399731661399314,2.9878441007049847,3.0670934723591254,3.3956930001684253,3.506637894120152,3.520060914452293,3.5670958631572662,3.6466665387238555,3.8095464139032247,3.8767358583910254,3.8844878351953436,4.235066888824737,3.952924996748572,4.364659717870332,4.436351646326448,4.364659717870332,4.506310234933358,4.944927550358424,5.390512652256013,5.408212229355414,5.719991853386255,6.389041482367141,6.342521466732247,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.031520974032012074,6.75283528230649E-5,6.80533213746611E-5,6.7660108558762E-5,6.766121709346396E-5,6.7566640233262E-5,6.776759288827812E-5,6.753807646462794E-5,6.768992668106944E-5,7.509827860514108E-5,0.8671902466975716,6.742905511871295E-5,6.868758499463258E-5,6.966742848771816E-5,6.747822368229237E-5,6.729174298614668E-5,6.897025133987228E-5,6.777394220020051E-5,6.756367380854149E-5,6.761967208151211E-5,6.827393206863582E-5,6.784108902689326E-5,6.791833639867966E-5,6.799151078848884E-5,6.851331070336289E-5,0.051299684966586406,7.102011232689963E-5,6.744910115854519E-5,6.74509055799587E-5,6.76217920678096E-5,0.04481376936560905,6.777001527898952E-5,7.274537048736677E-5,6.79606423313792E-5,6.752251647189052E-5,6.783417739670944E-5,6.745485722301034E-5,6.74947180806591E-5,6.729140490698915E-5,6.73088634019649E-5,6.746036747323447E-5,6.817193140568649E-5,6.782552117421211E-5,6.755735802336951E-5,6.837825076156943E-5,6.758328690654435E-5,6.982874392493838E-5,6.880189189161091E-5,6.732559333415753E-5,6.747438701266861E-5,6.745098435314358E-5,6.934930860393759E-5,6.747539090291317E-5,6.73028

{"value":"I like to keep my reviews short and simple, but this pretty much sums it up. You can not beat the original two for a number of reasons one of which including the directing talent of Chris Columbous.<br /><br />This movie had terrible directing covered up by even more terrible acting. I cant even believe these people are considered actors.<br /><br />Painful to sit through and watch. The storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back. Horrible, rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself! <br /><br />The movie wasn't even set during Christmas like the original.

{"value":"Yes, indeed, it could have been a good movie. A love biangle, (sorry for the poetical license, but is not a triangle!) an interesting story, unfortunately badly told. The image is sometimes weird, sometimes OK, the picture looks crowded and narrow-sighted. The sound needs more attention (it usually does in Romanian movies), the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen. The soundtrack is short and is not helping the action. About the acting... sorry but the best actress is the landlady. The others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer. The acting is poetical when it should be realistic, and realistic when it should be poetical. It's a picture for adults, told by the children. Bother only if extremely curious.","finished_norm":["ye","ind","it","can","have","be","a","good","movi","a","love","biangl","sorri","for","the","poetic","licens","but","be","not","a","triangl","a","interest","stori","unfortun","badli","tell","the","imag","be","sometim","weird","sometim","okai","the","pictur","look","crowd","and","narrowsight","the","sound","ne","much","attent","it","usual","doe","in","romanian","movi","the","light","and","color","filter","be","sometim","badli","choos","the","soundtrack","be","short","and","be","not","help","the","action","about","the","act","sorri","but","the","well","actress","be","the","landladi","the","other","be","act","immatur","and","cannot","convinc","the","viewer","the","act","be","poetic","when","it","should","be","realist","and","realist","when","it","should","be","poetic","it","a","pictur","for","adult","tell","by","the","child","bother","onli","if","extrem","curiou"],"filtered":["ye","ind","good","movi","love","biangl","sorri","poetic","licens","triangl","interest","stori","unfortun","badli","tell","imag","sometim","weird","sometim","okai","pictur","look","crowd","narrowsight","sound","ne","much","attent","usual","doe","romanian","movi","light","color","filter","sometim","badli","choos","soundtrack","short","help","action","act","sorri","well","actress","landladi","act","immatur","convinc","viewer","act","poetic","realist","realist","poetic","pictur","adult","tell","child","bother","onli","extrem","curiou"],"filtered2":["ye","ind","good","love","biangl","sorri","poetic","licens","triangl","interest","stori","unfortun","badli","tell","imag","sometim","weird","sometim","okai","pictur","look","crowd","narrowsight","sound","ne","attent","usual","doe","romanian","light","color","filter","sometim","badli","choos","soundtrack","short","help","action","act","sorri","well","actress","landladi","act","immatur","convinc","viewer","act","poetic","realist","realist","poetic","pictur","adult","tell","child","bother","onli","extrem","curiou"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,11,16,17,18,20,21,54,60,90,110,129,178,180,185,191,209,227,265,272,279,311,329,353,354,437,448,478,496,500,584,625,636,734,740,796,829,875,958,1595,1720,3537,4293,4472,4529,4730,5361],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,11,16,17,18,20,21,54,60,90,110,129,178,180,185,191,209,227,265,272,279,311,329,353,354,437,448,478,496,500,584,625,636,734,740,796,829,875,958,1595,1720,3537,4293,4472,4529,4730,5361],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,3.4860466360051467,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,4.095425683930709,2.1290479736304078,2.4106958340079214,2.532833256045391,2.7097314792693545,2.518833027372001,2.5460113484259455,2.6026896854443837,2.6005321873043625,2.73529586597515,2.8028805344481915,2.7910771187233068,5.8406676183565125,2.951986790814132,3.0266839340212486,3.0316467233633775,6.390478590102111,6.5362921317182865,3.3243163373261977,3.293679367864308,10.144424253498439,3.5146700658174166,3.6194333882654965,3.530930586689197,3.79165684915245,3.7740817043309423,3.850067611308864,3.8240921249056035,3.9282323841582003,8.135175810137424,4.613282354485526,4.724033718778229,5.626901430320244,5.967828017290836,18.304078229746075,5.999576715605417,6.255510089742618,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.597362471969351E-5,6.552874914483423E-5,6.603817268455258E-5,6.565660341925302E-5,6.565767912877895E-5,6.556590281426825E-5,6.576090499587103E-5,6.553818485653342E-5,6.568553858759296E-5,7.287451943066377E-5,0.7402501580173577,6.543239177660128E-5,6.665365492137992E-5,6.760448395504283E-5,6.548010439410063E-5,6.52991456375602E-5,6.692795114296008E-5,6.576706629628501E-5,6.556302422929999E-5,6.561736431947886E-5,6.625225080462777E-5,6.583222481679192E-5,6.590718479191752E-5,6.597819239143939E-5,6.648454112195217E-5,6.61368456887151E-5,6.891711303992875E-5,0.04049682284425011,6.54535952168425E-5,6.561942153018326E-5,6.701414697313447E-5,6.576325565639541E-5,7.05912840290688E-5,6.594823799009741E-5,6.552308561572331E-5,6.582551784910262E-5,6.545742984652641E-5,6.549611037155576E-5,6.529881756937286E-5,6.531575909526362E-5,6.546277693096675E-5,6.615327051596996E-5,6.581711794878141E-5,6.555689546286508E-5,6.635348048334176E-5,6.558205655757771E-5,6.776102262919781E-5,6.676457704023039E-5,6.533199363207712E-5,6.547638133332961E-5,6.545367165744937E-5,6.729578402100385E-5,6.54773554970587E-5,6.53099605483927E-5,6.602683083116559E-5,6.549422072564397E-5,7.043183638938989E-5,6.544024497761294E-5,6.533123810505053E-5,6.564317559228413E-5,6.629430072503476E-5,6.563883292283414E-5,6.531915167994499E-5,6.547123732052633E-5,6.52996073701303E-5,6.681050493874527E-5,6.586213283464322E-5,0.15464932053326508,6.566436013198

{"value":"A remake of Alejandro Amenabar's Abre los Ojos, but this time with a living, breathing mask as a lead. For the dubious advantage of an English sound track, we endure Tom Cruise's soulless performance, as usual, with zero depth. Yes, the character is identified with his persona, but we usually are given some character underneath that to hold our interest. His empty posturing negates any erotic energy that could have been between his character and Cruz or Diaz.<br /><br />There is an acting exercise that involves using masks to free the actor to enrich his presentation of character by verbal and body language means.

{"value":"This movie was on t.v the other day, and I didn't enjoy it at all. The first George of the jungle was a good comedy, but the sequel.... completely awful. The new actor and actress to play the lead roles weren't good at all, they should of had the original actor (Brendon Fraiser) and original actress (i forgot her name) so this movie gets the 0 out of ten rating, not a film that you can sit down and watch and enjoy, this is a film that you turn to another channel or take it back to the shop if hired or bought. It was good to see Ape the ape back, but wasn't as fun as the first, they should of had the new George as Georges son grown up, and still had Bredon and (whats her face) in the film, that would've been a bit better then it was.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","on","tv","the","other","dai","and","i","do","not","enjoi","it","at","all","the","georg","of","the","jungl","be","a","good","comedi","but","the","sequel","complet","aw","the","new","actor","and","actress","to","plai","the","lead","role","be","not","good","at","all","thei","should","of","have","the","origin","actor","brendon","fraiser","and","origin","actress","i","forget","her","name","so","thi","movi","get","the","out","of","ten","rate","not","a","film","that","you","can","sit","down","and","watch","and","enjoi","thi","be","a","film","that","you","turn","to","anoth","channel","or","take","it","back","to","the","shop","if","hire","or","bui","it","be","good","to","see","ap","the","ap","back","but","be","not","a","fun","a","the","thei","should","of","have","the","new","georg","a","georg","son","grow","up","and","still","have","bredon","and","what","her","face","in","the","film","that","would","have","be","a","bite","well","then","it","be"],"filtered":["thi","movi","tv","dai","enjoi","georg","jungl","good","comedi","sequel","complet","aw","new","actor","actress","plai","lead","role","good","thei","origin","actor","brendon","fraiser","origin","actress","forget","name","thi","movi","get","ten","rate","film","sit","watch","enjoi","thi","film","turn","anoth","channel","take","back","shop","hire","bui","good","see","ap","ap","back","fun","thei","new","georg","georg","son","grow","still","bredon","face","film","bite","well"],"filtered2":["tv","dai","enjoi","georg","jungl","good","comedi","sequel","complet","aw","new","actor","actress","plai","lead","role","good","origin","actor","brendon","fraiser","origin","actress","forget","name","get","ten","rate","sit","watch","enjoi","turn","anoth","channel","take","back","shop","hire","bui","good","see","ap","ap","back","fun","new","georg","georg","son","grow","still","bredon","face","bite","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,7,20,31,40,41,63,64,69,73,87,96,103,127,128,132,138,143,154,157,172,200,202,244,251,259,347,354,373,387,434,545,561,680,728,1014,1431,1441,1936],"values":[1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,7,20,31,40,41,63,64,69,73,87,96,103,127,128,132,138,143,154,157,172,200,202,244,251,259,347,354,373,387,434,545,561,680,728,1014,1431,1441,1936],"values":[0.6557002054693947,2.0358433949768115,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.165345040023057,1.4070669811451506,1.6284968758320737,3.1375198335242067,3.745925514644013,1.883428577602134,4.254065042302116,1.8950689206770979,4.230048743045324,2.0390708128715254,2.098582041218749,2.4359679371086367,2.3409902041158843,2.253494045787767,2.2907365189289424,2.3409902041158843,2.348499626138016,2.3360150694757706,2.5001408943598484,5.061642365863941,2.597304642813496,2.634508058031767,2.6942272927333892,2.7464553122240485,3.0151989841543516,6.063293446726755,3.0316467233633775,3.360519385990158,3.4101163271295305,3.442099372982581,3.4725585804672896,11.428639241709675,3.7740817043309423,4.1302590120314875,4.520909034354511,10.258997653772786,5.1994574154933035]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.319894386997066E-5,9.257048160332101E-5,9.329012882728323E-5,0.04401610722597973,9.275261709137211E-5,9.262296746819287E-5,9.289844115112202E-5,9.258381114779825E-5,9.279197330606072E-5,1.0294762906883481E-4,0.5983509033698731,9.243436046413008E-5,9.415960196426417E-5,9.550280937654138E-5,9.250176263551454E-5,9.224612767434259E-5,9.454709193874125E-5,9.290714503383104E-5,9.261890097828844E-5,9.269566557983926E-5,9.359255051142515E-5,9.299919250463738E-5,9.31050861938792E-5,9.320539648166919E-5,9.392070001568289E-5,9.342952119530147E-5,0.20690650419194476,9.246184035196877E-5,9.246431392273248E-5,9.269857173916857E-5,9.466885818051409E-5,9.290176185813487E-5,9.97221714865741E-5,9.316308080504552E-5,9.256248090707372E-5,9.298971777427551E-5,9.246973098808535E-5,9.252437379566776E-5,9.224566422233875E-5,9.226959700346565E-5,9.247728465251929E-5,9.345272405189612E-5,9.297785148919757E-5,9.261024305534746E-5,9.373555461624015E-5,9.264578737269843E-5,9.57239468260606E-5,9.431629828605346E-5,9.229253104251025E-5,9.249650318018983E-5,9.24644219080654E-5,9.506671831822223E-5,9.249787935182041E-5,9.226140557171325E-5,9.327410653410644E-5,9.252170435005193E-5,9.949692463015847E-5,9.244545444363165E-5,9.229146373233529E-5,9.273212838411309E-5,9.365195316192978E-5,9.272599362635141E-5,9.227438960521577E-5,9.248923638891443E-5,9.22467799499765E-5,9.438117923891819E-5,9.30414426567069E-5,9.284325076138211E-5,9.276205514249627E-5,9.310018757885634E-5,9.224341464114524E-5,9.27639998555284E-5,0.14363502879808343,9.240871996392684E-5,9.469578763503676E-5,9.26530392312662E-5,9.337818837541423E-5,9.280750196653212E-5,9.221449361387289E-5,9.232879981205236E-5]}}
{"value":"When I go to see movies I would stay up and watch it or if I did not like it, I would go sleep, but this was pure crap, I actually got up and walked out!....This was poorly script and put together, I hated it. Also, they should not have taken Brendan Frasier off, he was much better. This was not as good as I had expected, considering that I really liked George of The Jungle 1, and the graphics weren't as good as the first one, for instance, the bird, and when ever he crashed in a tree. I hope that the director of this takes heed, and next movies he make, he needs to reconsider...horrible! I really would like to give Ursla a job well done, as she made the movie worthwhile (until I walked out)...overall I give this movie a 2 out of

{"value":"My complaints here concern the movie's pacing and the material at hand. While using archival film and letters lends the film a fresh and interesting perspective, too often the material selected to highlight simply isn't very interesting (such as when Goebbels complains about this or that ailment, &tc., or the ad nauseam footage of his small German hometown). Also, the movie crawls along in covering c. 1920-1939 and then steams through the war years. In sum, the film is little better than a History Channel documentary, with the exception that the filmmaker has a slightly greater sensibility than your average History Channel documentary editor and thus can more artfully arrange the details of Goebbels' life. Still, I found it wanting.","finished_norm":["my","complaint","here","concern","the","movi","pace","and","the","materi","at","hand","while","us","archiv","film","and","letter","lend","the","film","a","fresh","and","interest","perspect","too","often","the","materi","select","to","highlight","simpli","be","not","veri","interest","such","a","when","goebbel","complain","about","thi","or","that","ailment","tc","or","the","ad","nauseam","footag","of","hi","small","german","hometown","conjur","the","movi","crawl","along","in","cover","c","and","then","steam","through","the","war","year","in","sum","the","film","be","littl","well","than","a","histori","channel","documentari","with","the","except","that","the","filmmak","have","a","slightli","great","sensibl","than","your","averag","histori","channel","documentari","editor","and","thu","can","much","artfulli","arrang","the","detail","of","goebbel","life","still","i","find","it","want"],"filtered":["complaint","concern","movi","pace","materi","hand","us","archiv","film","letter","lend","film","fresh","interest","perspect","often","materi","select","highlight","simpli","veri","interest","goebbel","complain","thi","ailment","tc","ad","nauseam","footag","hi","small","german","hometown","conjur","movi","crawl","along","cover","c","steam","war","year","sum","film","littl","well","histori","channel","documentari","except","filmmak","slightli","great","sensibl","averag","histori","channel","documentari","editor","thu","much","artfulli","arrang","detail","goebbel","life","still","find","want"],"filtered2":["complaint","concern","pace","materi","hand","us","archiv","letter","lend","fresh","interest","perspect","often","materi","select","highlight","simpli","veri","interest","goebbel","complain","ailment","tc","ad","nauseam","footag","small","german","hometown","conjur","crawl","along","cover","c","steam","war","year","sum","littl","well","histori","channel","documentari","except","filmmak","slightli","great","sensibl","averag","histori","channel","documentari","editor","thu","artfulli","arrang","detail","goebbel","life","still","find","want"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[14,15,20,37,38,39,51,56,57,60,64,75,201,233,235,314,323,324,363,400,491,499,537,546,624,643,658,728,741,874,925,965,1110,1148,1192,1385,1658,1663,1831,1832,1979,2088,2373,2561,2668,2762,2905,3104,3673,4996,7101],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[14,15,20,37,38,39,51,56,57,60,64,75,201,233,235,314,323,324,363,400,491,499,537,546,624,643,658,728,741,874,925,965,1110,1148,1192,1385,1658,1663,1831,1832,1979,2088,2373,2561,2668,2762,2905,3104,3673,4996,7101],"values":[1.1175081997259209,1.2000607798565692,1.165345040023057,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.5538940054862738,1.7139899308309823,1.8610609350701788,1.834162586674748,3.676353282473182,1.883428577602134,1.9742250248702675,2.561435818751577,2.6102777977348763,2.6457189377809835,3.189397019426827,3.0433232530252132,2.8753661172782943,3.0349689855553557,3.130944944345658,3.369778711402955,6.762949502332293,6.849501469295936,3.4572130107926293,7.8483511669251715,3.5813614403160887,3.813163054373413,7.5481634086618845,3.7165362186843414,3.872882289075035,4.339813719283801,3.9868265484242533,4.2078172463773615,4.176068548062782,4.268777946167049,4.403125998698128,4.637773374493822,4.828393734102471,4.798834931860927,4.8085911068062925,4.979216623837056,4.9676558014359795,5.156897801074508,5.290429193699031,5.259176650194926,5.322690055917252,5.408212229355414,5.426230734858092,5.719991853386255,6.2980697041614135,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.154077149470263E-5,6.112578768545595E-5,6.160098239826776E-5,6.124505126571333E-5,6.124605469692409E-5,6.11604449517581E-5,6.1342344684416E-5,6.113458939947478E-5,0.04264079837661016,0.2332118385850768,0.49614174140573025,6.10359046934959E-5,6.217510958707346E-5,6.306205118744472E-5,6.108041143847796E-5,6.09116115349781E-5,6.243097549054392E-5,6.134809199908149E-5,6.115775978263919E-5,6.120844869183446E-5,6.18006763324049E-5,6.140887243427034E-5,6.147879575165745E-5,6.154503225867263E-5,6.201735876268868E-5,6.169302543558248E-5,6.42864830253721E-5,6.105405010832529E-5,6.10556834471468E-5,6.121036767588928E-5,6.251137971133815E-5,6.134453740101764E-5,6.584816429865343E-5,6.151709053232244E-5,6.112050469619546E-5,6.140261611641993E-5,6.105926042309963E-5,6.109534195359368E-5,6.091130551011684E-5,6.092710871295805E-5,6.106424823001647E-5,6.170834665743782E-5,6.139478061627208E-5,6.11520428159526E-5,6.189510425799924E-5,6.117551330414915E-5,6.320807182549798E-5,6.227857870520798E-5,6.094225243023304E-5,6.107693853497837E-5,6.105575475161036E-5,0.01817008017196437,6.107784724338577E-5,6.09216997779556E-5,6.159040261868797E-5,6.109357927543619E-5,0.03637389862138427,6.1

{"value":"slow, incomprehensible, boring. Three enthusiastic words that describe the movie of the book. This is surely a case where the movie should never have been made at the expense of the book. The best part of the movie was the scenery, excellent. The worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors which combined with endless meaningful glances. The editing is abrupt and patchy. However, despite this, the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script. It was startling that although set in Peru there was hardly a person of Peruvian descent wandering about the set - even in the flashback scenes depicting Peru in the 17th century. If you have any sense of history, try to avoid this movie.","finished_norm":["slow","incomprehens","bore","three","enthusiast","word","that","describ","the","movi","of","the","book","thi","be","sure","a","case","where","the","movi","should","never","have","be","make","at","the","expens","of","the","book","the","well","part","of","the","movi","be","the","sceneri","excel","the","wrong","part","be","the","slow","move","interact","of","the","actor","which","combin","with","endless","meaning","glanc","the","edit","be","abrupt","and","patchi","howev","despit","thi","the","actor","work","veri","hard","at","littl","try","to","be","a","littl","believ","with","a","terribl","script","it","be","startl","that","although","set","in","peru","there","be","hardli","a","person","of","peruvian","descent","wander","about","the","set","even","in","the","flashback","scene","depict","peru","in","the","th","centuri","if","you","have","ani","sens","of","histori","try","to","avoid","thi","movi"],"filtered":["slow","incomprehens","bore","three","enthusiast","word","describ","movi","book","thi","sure","case","movi","never","make","expens","book","well","part","movi","sceneri","excel","wrong","part","slow","move","interact","actor","combin","endless","meaning","glanc","edit","abrupt","patchi","howev","despit","thi","actor","work","veri","hard","littl","try","littl","believ","terribl","script","startl","although","set","peru","hardli","person","peruvian","descent","wander","set","even","flashback","scene","depict","peru","th","centuri","ani","sens","histori","try","avoid","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["slow","incomprehens","bore","three","enthusiast","word","describ","book","sure","case","never","make","expens","book","well","part","sceneri","excel","wrong","part","slow","move","interact","actor","combin","endless","meaning","glanc","edit","abrupt","patchi","howev","despit","actor","work","veri","hard","littl","try","littl","believ","terribl","script","startl","although","set","peru","hardli","person","peruvian","descent","wander","set","even","flashback","scene","depict","peru","th","centuri","ani","sens","histori","try","avoid"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,14,15,19,20,25,27,36,41,42,48,61,77,91,108,109,113,119,151,153,166,171,173,224,237,258,275,288,335,348,390,391,499,580,665,668,853,968,1011,1051,1138,1163,1242,1321,1743,1917,2501,2524,3059,3724,4244,4308,4871,8269],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,14,15,19,20,25,27,36,41,42,48,61,77,91,108,109,113,119,151,153,166,171,173,224,237,258,275,288,335,348,390,391,499,580,665,668,853,968,1011,1051,1138,1163,1242,1321,1743,1917,2501,2524,3059,3724,4244,4308,4871,8269],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.926017105726131,2.2350163994518417,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,2.9360366939211433,3.1375198335242067,1.6219954307453837,1.6955116224012472,3.7637034094785053,1.9463902258768238,2.0105926690411424,2.138507503627933,4.251382278653714,2.1521782565202803,2.1653408989309972,5.6004909736203725,2.3409902041158843,2.4423870329693536,2.373087554090762,2.4368824319140248,2.689504733779216,2.640097787510554,2.7061321952397077,2.7832848715031413,2.8015621426949333,2.908534262247101,3.0103169565570433,6.265556250854638,3.109204957709252,3.3814747511661465,3.5039747767006686,3.5929222627171646,3.5813614403160887,3.8962296530720266,3.9911462095687695,4.086456389373095,4.191816905030921,4.224077767249142,4.2860694432771105,4.364659717870332,4.370968887063596,4.724033718778229,4.848596441419991,5.156897801074508,5.2288713006995975,5.426230734858092,5.822646007446338,5.878215858601149,5.907203395474402,6.0662680901040895,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.629374930611536E-5,6.584671505633082E-5,6.635861047781492E-5,6.597518971953216E-5,6.597627064873595E-5,6.588404900694708E-5,6.60799973999033E-5,6.58561965530436E-5,6.600426529032592E-5,0.06972989538873878,0.5729629072359935,6.574989013211947E-5,6.697707922625736E-5,0.10929845912629277,6.579783426610755E-5,6.561599744128842E-5,6.725270641858322E-5,6.608618859686693E-5,6.588115645418751E-5,6.593576021941786E-5,6.657372737164164E-5,6.615166328682062E-5,6.62269869911052E-5,6.629833914162797E-5,6.680714483397404E-5,6.6457762274143E-5,6.925152034895613E-5,6.576943697159739E-5,6.577119645806035E-5,6.59378274123497E-5,6.733932049778672E-5,6.608235946656508E-5,0.17500161190262445,6.626823939219602E-5,6.584102404601173E-5,6.6144923774834E-5,6.577504969456246E-5,6.581391790955323E-5,6.5615667781212E-5,6.563269151266585E-5,6.57804227247228E-5,6.647426679977815E-5,6.613648311557877E-5,6.587499794906795E-5,6.667544824830284E-5,6.590028113325306E-5,6.808982022728126E-5,6.7088539573795E-5,6.564900482451112E-5,6.579409313988547E-5,6.577127326958086E-5,6.762232413637858E-5,6.5795

{"value":"I don't what that other review was talking about. This definitely isn't a bimbo movie, in fact, I don't think there was one decent looking girl in it. No, it's just cheesy, poorly-done, Ed Wood-style science fiction schlock. And it's bad. I can't even begin to tell you how bad it is. I saw it late at night on cable, and I was in shock. The fact that this movie was ever released is an insult to us all. The actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke, and the pace is insanely slow. To me though, the music tops it all. A monkey could write a better theme with a toy xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on cable, watch it.

{"value":"With an absolutely amazing cast and crew, this might have been a classic. Instead it is a repetitive paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the JFK assassination grafted, rather pointlessly, on to a vaguely incoherent plot about the murder of fictitious president Kegan in 1960. Many superb character actors are wasted as they are either not given enough to do - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for instance, or they are asked to go rather luridly over the top - John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins do manage to acquit themselves very well, in their very different ways, though.<br /><br />The photography is gorgeous, but does not justify an hour and a half of your

{"value":"> you are warned this is a spoiler! > This movie is so bad that i doubt i can write enough lines. great direction the shots were well thought out. the actors were very good particularly Richard pryor tho i would have liked to have seen more of him. Madeline Kahn and john houseman were classic. Dudley More god bless him could have done better. John Ritter again i would have liked to see more of him. In my opinion this failure is due totally to writer failure. Maybe the producer could have pulled the plug once he saw what he was creating. Its just too bad that so much money went into this boiler,when with a little change here and there would in my opinion fixed it.They must have paid the writers standard rates.

{"value":"It was so terrible. It wasn't fun to watch at all. Even the scene where the girl is using a vibrator, even that's not fun to watch in this movie. I say again, the scene where a girl is masturbating with a vibrator is not even fun to watch. Or maybe if that was the only part of the movie that you watched, just girl on couch using a vibrator. Maybe they should have just released that one scene in theaters, maybe then the movie would be enjoyable on a certain level. My advice, fast forward to that point, watch it, rewind the movie, watch it again, rewind, repeat. Maybe you could enjoy yourself for 2 hours that way. This movie ranks alongside I spit on your grave and Doom generation in the category of worst movies that I have ever seen.","finished_norm":["it","be","so","terribl","it","be","not","fun","to","watch","at","all","even","the","scene","where","the","girl","be","us","a","vibrat","even","that","not","fun","to","watch","in","thi","movi","i","sai","again","the","scene","where","a","girl","be","masturb","with","a","vibrat","be","not","even","fun","to","watch","or","mayb","if","that","be","the","onli","part","of","the","movi","that","you","watch","just","girl","on","couch","us","a","vibrat","mayb","thei","should","have","just","releas","that","on","scene","in","theater","mayb","then","the","movi","would","be","enjoy","on","a","certain","level","my","advic","fast","forward","to","that","point","watch","it","rewind","the","movi","watch","it","again","rewind","repeat","mayb","you","can","enjoi","yourself","for","hour","that","wai","thi","movi","rank","alongsid","i","spit","on","your","grave","and","doom","gener","in","the","categori","of","wrong","movi","that","i","have","ever","see"],"filtered":["terribl","fun","watch","even","scene","girl","us","vibrat","even","fun","watch","thi","movi","sai","scene","girl","masturb","vibrat","even","fun","watch","mayb","onli","part","movi","watch","girl","couch","us","vibrat","mayb","thei","releas","scene","theater","mayb","movi","enjoy","certain","level","advic","fast","forward","point","watch","rewind","movi","watch","rewind","repeat","mayb","enjoi","hour","wai","thi","movi","rank","alongsid","spit","grave","doom","gener","categori","wrong","movi","ever","see"],"filtered2":["terribl","fun","watch","even","scene","girl","us","vibrat","even","fun","watch","scene","girl","masturb","vibrat","even","fun","watch","mayb","onli","part","watch","girl","couch","us","vibrat","mayb","releas","scene","theater","mayb","enjoy","certain","level","advic","fast","forward","point","watch","rewind","watch","rewind","repeat","mayb","enjoi","hour","wai","rank","alongsid","spit","grave","doom","gener","categori","wrong","ever","see"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,11,19,25,33,44,56,61,66,84,163,166,174,200,225,259,327,424,445,542,699,736,774,988,1283,1444,1473,1654,2071,2215,3575,3701,3776,5402,7660],"values":[1.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,7,11,19,25,33,44,56,61,66,84,163,166,174,200,225,259,327,424,445,542,699,736,774,988,1283,1444,1473,1654,2071,2215,3575,3701,3776,5402,7660],"values":[0.6557002054693947,2.7780513171783934,5.765698632433759,0.9913098153388195,3.9371420340352055,1.2796387880827016,1.4018535447685214,1.604729392502474,3.7221218701403576,1.8818517047392527,1.929723173391612,6.6638083547706675,9.600229743211463,2.4423870329693536,2.456282578459816,2.5308211829319704,2.641219492619754,8.239365936672145,2.9674191958529437,3.212973749990824,3.241201430615691,3.4471119148061256,3.5813614403160887,3.68099128126493,3.753391311073496,4.039936373738201,4.3773181147422555,4.573751515728891,4.535724120139652,4.637773374493822,5.039114765418124,5.00274712124725,5.649374286172302,5.7959777603641776,5.7446844659766265,12.596139408322827,21.10700594187658]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.335147401002971E-5,7.285684787260532E-5,7.342324039222981E-5,7.299900012703953E-5,7.300019613346891E-5,7.28981564475009E-5,7.311496577875272E-5,7.286733878263807E-5,7.3031171123517E-5,8.102409774699083E-5,0.7172565239824366,7.274971483236926E-5,7.41075521833447E-5,7.516471269933932E-5,7.28027631655073E-5,7.260156773955245E-5,7.441252302970599E-5,7.312181609915129E-5,7.28949559495537E-5,7.29553729075334E-5,7.366125892960031E-5,7.319426131561168E-5,7.327760408615944E-5,7.335655248581116E-5,7.391952633943865E-5,7.353294802662266E-5,7.662413346959265E-5,7.277134265554943E-5,7.277328945938703E-5,7.295766017669829E-5,7.450835816418092E-5,7.311757931431477E-5,7.848552747793566E-5,7.3323248275214E-5,7.285055098941677E-5,7.318680430581058E-5,7.277755291680342E-5,7.282055909599155E-5,7.260120298340605E-5,7.262003908497462E-5,7.278349796722351E-5,7.355120964699933E-5,7.317746504223798E-5,7.288814180141838E-5,7.377380915218974E-5,7.291611666853717E-5,7.53387571381227E-5,7.423087875441864E-5,7.263808913467553E-5,7.279862375378718E-5,7.27733744483688E-5,7.482149076353141E-5,7.279970685852423E-5,7.261359208495142E-5,7.341063017614003E-5,7.281845813043786E-5,7.83082487637341E-5,7.275844625909243E-5,7.263724911684583E-5,7.298407066234657E-5,7.370801130461323E-5,7.297924235093199E-5,7.262381106336962E-5,7.27929044845633E-5,7.260208110780773E-5,7.428194278293855E-5,7.322751395563914E-5,7.307152862946208E-5,7.300762427517302E-5,7.327374867087665E-5,7.259943246874572E-5,7.300915484581588E-5,7.419331487068152E-5,7.272953468433147E-5,7.452955277327734E-5,7.292182418509443E-5,0.18389552459981398,0.09318939756781486,7.257667040844522E-5,7.266663417602445E-5]}}
{"value":"Me and a friend rented this movie because it sounded really good. But we were wrong. First of the acting....wow...the acting was the worst, the effects were really bad as well, it seemed like a film a college kid made. The plot was pretty good, but it'd been done. The thing that ruined the movies the most were the actors. The main guy was the worst actor ever...it's a shame I'm even calling him an actor...The only good thing about this movie was it was so bad it was funny...so if you want a good laugh see it....but other than that...stay far away from this one.

{"value":"Boy, this was one lousy movie! While I haven't seen all of the Burton/Taylor collaborations, I can say with confidence that this is the worst. This rich but ill woman (Taylor, of course) owns this beautiful island in the Meditteranean, ruling over a put-upon staff when she's suddenly visited by this traveling poet, who mouths platitudes. In fact, the whole film is just a talk fest, with much of the talk making no sense. Even in 1968, no one could make heads or tails of this pretentious nonsense, and the passage of time makes that even more clear. If it weren't for the beautiful cinematography and scenery, it would deserve a negative rating. The only thing this film is good for is its unintentional laughs at the expense of the stars.","finished_norm":["boi","thi","be","on","lousi","movi","while","i","have","not","see","all","of","the","burtontaylor","collabor","i","can","sai","with","confid","that","thi","be","the","wrong","thi","rich","but","ill","woman","taylor","of","cours","own","thi","beauti","island","in","the","meditteranean","rule","over","a","putupon","staff","when","she","suddenli","visit","by","thi","travel","poet","who","mouth","platitud","in","fact","the","whole","film","be","just","a","talk","fest","with","much","of","the","talk","make","no","sens","even","in","no","on","can","make","head","or","tail","of","thi","pretenti","nonsens","and","the","passag","of","time","make","that","even","much","clear","if","it","be","not","for","the","beauti","cinematographi","and","sceneri","it","would","deserv","a","neg","rate","the","onli","thing","thi","film","be","good","for","be","it","unintent","laugh","at","the","expens","of","the","star"],"filtered":["boi","thi","lousi","movi","see","burtontaylor","collabor","sai","confid","thi","wrong","thi","rich","ill","woman","taylor","cours","thi","beauti","island","meditteranean","rule","putupon","staff","suddenli","visit","thi","travel","poet","mouth","platitud","fact","whole","film","talk","fest","much","talk","make","sens","even","make","head","tail","thi","pretenti","nonsens","passag","time","make","even","much","clear","beauti","cinematographi","sceneri","deserv","neg","rate","onli","thing","thi","film","good","unintent","laugh","expens","star"],"filtered2":["boi","lousi","see","burtontaylor","collabor","confid","wrong","rich","ill","woman","taylor","cours","beauti","island","meditteranean","rule","putupon","staff","suddenli","visit","travel","poet","mouth","platitud","fact","whole","talk","fest","talk","make","sens","even","make","head","tail","pretenti","nonsens","passag","time","make","even","clear","beauti","cinematographi","sceneri","deserv","neg","rate","onli","thing","good","unintent","laugh","expens","star"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,8,11,25,29,70,97,100,111,133,173,186,199,202,208,282,325,423,590,629,720,785,905,937,941,1032,1047,1117,1138,1147,1167,1289,1489,1615,1743,2127,2712,2832,3177,3361,4320,4607,6482,7651],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,5,8,11,25,29,70,97,100,111,133,173,186,199,202,208,282,325,423,590,629,720,785,905,937,941,1032,1047,1117,1138,1147,1167,1289,1489,1615,1743,2127,2712,2832,3177,3361,4320,4607,6482,7651],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,1.852034211452262,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,2.094675786251684,2.0545557924622586,2.1405462403177813,2.1183455303375887,2.3212364753796515,2.4368824319140248,5.143705159219666,2.558331832813986,2.597304642813496,2.6289494000279396,2.918851229218033,5.947318931426056,3.164467636384302,3.4986697244709752,3.488143311483988,4.072271754381138,3.7952092507568174,3.9121030022283168,4.030886538218284,3.9612932464190886,4.140259095366071,4.140259095366071,4.224077767249142,4.224077767249142,4.246178114249808,4.2574141875167335,4.443131333311827,4.5432147918688095,5.1994574154933035,4.724033718778229,4.9676558014359795,5.373120909544144,5.3560264761848435,5.482320201509136,5.719991853386255,5.9370563586240825,6.032366538428407,6.489124940924123,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.193210356902525E-5,7.144704857830628E-5,7.20024812527305E-5,7.15864501489841E-5,7.158762301237245E-5,7.148755782134169E-5,7.170017183463615E-5,7.145733648645256E-5,7.161799862816286E-5,0.25901836679567153,0.2256541773280068,7.134198859076095E-5,7.267355142952411E-5,7.371025560966384E-5,7.139401042460886E-5,7.11967081834103E-5,7.297262100927098E-5,7.170688959952147E-5,7.148441925387705E-5,7.15436671277252E-5,7.223589406839037E-5,7.177793298186436E-5,7.185966304773804E-5,7.193708377495587E-5,7.248916393547518E-5,7.211006601535408E-5,7.514143620164889E-5,7.136319790983688E-5,7.136510704250484E-5,7.154591013762621E-5,7.306660170852263E-5,7.170273479759316E-5,0.13549450574637437,7.190442400965065E-5,7.144087354147445E-5,7.177062026717707E-5,7.136928800089151E-5,7.1411461999127E-5,7.119635048539189E-5,7.121482210340849E-5,7.13751180130121E-5,7.212797426854194E-5,7.176146172082704E-5,7.147773696131212E-5,0.06772146310179619,7.150517050734614E-5,7.388093224248062E-5,7.279449159879854E-5,7.123252287986915E-5,7.13899511116014E-5,7.13651903869273E-5,7.337367510917764E-5,7.139101325797505E-5,7.12084998545425E-5,7.199011504766048E-5,7.140940168781297E-5,0.17754612416277138,7.13505510620655E-5,7.123169911660685E-5,7.157180957338535E-5,7.228174177256967E-5,7.156707469107487E-5,7.121852109302295E-5,7.13843425117511E-5,7.119721161785393E-5,0.06895875616296077,7.181054217450406E-5,7.165757520568375E-5,7.15949074175680

{"value":"Picked this up for 50 cents at the flea market, was pretty excited.<br /><br />I found it fascinating for about 15 min, then just repetitive and dull.<br /><br />It is neat seeing Mick and the gang in their prime, i wish there was not so much over dubbing of dialog so I could hear what there are saying and playing.<br /><br />The skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple, sort of poorly written Monty Python on acid. I spent more time looking at the late 60's England back drops rather then what was actually happening in the silly skits.<br /><br />This movie is a good reminder that times really change,and what was important quickly becomes just plain silly. Good song, but it has now been played to death by this DVD.","finished_norm":["pick","thi","up","for","cent","at","the","flea","market","be","pretti","excitedbr","br","i","find","it","fascin","for","about","min","then","just","repetit","and","dullbr","br","it","be","neat","see","mick","and","the","gang","in","their","prime","i","wish","there","be","not","so","much","over","dub","of","dialog","so","i","can","hear","what","there","be","sai","and","playingbr","br","the","skit","be","polit","date","and","incredibli","naiv","and","simpl","sort","of","poorli","write","monti","python","on","acid","i","spend","much","time","look","at","the","late","england","back","drop","rather","then","what","be","actual","happen","in","the","silli","skitsbr","br","thi","movi","be","a","good","remind","that","time","realli","changeand","what","be","import","quickli","becom","just","plain","silli","good","song","but","it","have","now","be","plai","to","death","by","thi","dvd"],"filtered":["pick","thi","cent","flea","market","pretti","excitedbr","br","find","fascin","min","repetit","dullbr","br","neat","see","mick","gang","prime","wish","much","dub","dialog","hear","sai","playingbr","br","skit","polit","date","incredibli","naiv","simpl","sort","poorli","write","monti","python","acid","spend","much","time","look","late","england","back","drop","rather","actual","happen","silli","skitsbr","br","thi","movi","good","remind","time","realli","changeand","import","quickli","becom","plain","silli","good","song","plai","death","thi","dvd"],"filtered2":["pick","cent","flea","market","pretti","excitedbr","find","fascin","min","repetit","dullbr","neat","see","mick","gang","prime","wish","dub","dialog","hear","playingbr","skit","polit","date","incredibli","naiv","simpl","sort","poorli","write","monti","python","acid","spend","time","look","late","england","back","drop","rather","actual","happen","silli","skitsbr","good","remind","time","realli","changeand","import","quickli","becom","plain","silli","good","song","plai","death","dvd"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,13,16,38,40,52,63,65,78,94,115,150,160,216,245,247,269,283,328,385,398,399,432,446,575,586,600,644,647,687,737,771,904,949,997,1241,1258,1825,1835,1999,2013,2191,2301,2939,2962,2999,5068,5106,6349,6424],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,8,13,16,38,40,52,63,65,78,94,115,150,160,216,245,247,269,283,328,385,398,399,432,446,575,586,600,644,647,687,737,771,904,949,997,1241,1258,1825,1835,1999,2013,2191,2301,2939,2962,2999,5068,5106,6349,6424],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.8837873718108231,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.7122153074726136,1.8729627573220065,1.9073850067444174,2.0064197866819473,2.08112281984698,2.201553588425805,2.332712011146513,2.3722295531801256,2.6070186965339692,2.7502029743242886,2.7303758068497004,2.76533567167316,2.7678802023081546,3.1550424959247185,6.18993968377476,3.143848349181566,3.129115117668582,3.235085203598255,3.233054746047873,3.6314455447135003,3.4572130107926293,3.558633189238533,3.5670958631572662,3.6746621462132825,3.604618302480356,3.6841709341823097,3.7264536553416874,3.9121030022283168,4.086456389373095,4.263079925052412,4.3215761317340196,4.34596758485818,4.900964426937307,4.828393734102471,4.9909126636002465,4.933754249760298,5.014723312293965,5.322690055917252,5.444579873526289,5.463272006538442,5.604922523601468,6.1754673820690815,6.214688095222362,6.489124940924123,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.70555498476084E-5,6.660337859867814E-5,6.712115635768812E-5,6.673332960118777E-5,6.673442295165994E-5,6.664114156445937E-5,6.683934165676011E-5,6.661296904999684E-5,6.676273928772859E-5,7.406961480539495E-5,0.6988612318854263,6.650544103141271E-5,6.774673210841042E-5,6.871315412833475E-5,6.655393610523472E-5,6.637000974115947E-5,6.802552661208255E-5,6.684560399854885E-5,6.663821577254405E-5,0.22056716824146716,6.733874522161633E-5,6.691183107699742E-5,6.698802034763347E-5,6.706019242624106E-5,6.757484495114678E-5,6.722144753582704E-5,7.004730948825263E-5,6.652521248924537E-5,6.652699219447336E-5,6.669553795298687E-5,6.811313599858318E-5,6.684173086660932E-5,7.17489358072468E-5,6.702974679193073E-5,6.659762219132255E-5,6.690501411934005E-5,6.653088970962443E-5,6.657020457045341E-5,6.63696762928643E-5,6.638689564891286E-5,6.65363244828198E-5,6.723814171971352E-5,6.689647646604153E-5,6.663198649827077E-5,0.048042850162461986,6.665756021879762E-5,6.887225993633721E-5,6.785947327886121E-5,6.640339642171676E-5,6.655015198865515E-5,6.652706988865715E-5,6.839939171338706E-5,6.655114212804452E-5,6.638100200959262E-5,6.71096285051806E-5,6.656828393556072E-5,7.158687332905533E-5,6.651342301988368E-5,6.640262850453156E-5,6.671968156646961E-5,6.73814847337459E-5,6.67152676800

{"value":"Ouch! They don't come much worse than this horrid adaptation of C. S. Lewis's beloved novel. While the adaptation is very true to the novel, the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play. I've read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the BBC has ever given at the time, but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the $2 that it looks like this was filmed for. The worst effect of all is Mr. Beaver. I know computer effects weren't at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time, but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid. Better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role! Avoid this at all costs.","finished_norm":["ouch","thei","do","not","come","much","wrong","than","thi","horrid","adapt","of","c","lewi","belov","novel","while","the","adapt","be","veri","true","to","the","novel","the","act","be","simpli","aw","and","the","set","and","special","effect","be","on","a","scale","equival","to","a","school","plai","i","have","read","that","the","budget","for","thi","miniseri","be","the","grand","that","the","bbc","have","ever","give","at","the","time","but","sure","thei","can","have","scrape","togeth","a","bite","much","than","the","that","it","look","like","thi","be","film","for","the","wrong","effect","of","all","be","mr","beaver","i","know","comput","effect","be","not","at","the","level","necessari","or","even","cost","effect","at","the","time","but","the","costum","store","man","in","a","suit","look","be","horrid","well","to","have","just","cut","the","charact","from","the","film","than","do","that","to","the","role","avoid","thi","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["ouch","thei","come","much","wrong","thi","horrid","adapt","c","lewi","belov","novel","adapt","veri","true","novel","act","simpli","aw","set","special","effect","scale","equival","school","plai","read","budget","thi","miniseri","grand","bbc","ever","give","time","sure","thei","scrape","togeth","bite","much","look","like","thi","film","wrong","effect","mr","beaver","know","comput","effect","level","necessari","even","cost","effect","time","costum","store","man","suit","look","horrid","well","cut","charact","film","role","avoid","thi","cost"],"filtered2":["ouch","come","wrong","horrid","adapt","c","lewi","belov","novel","adapt","veri","true","novel","act","simpli","aw","set","special","effect","scale","equival","school","plai","read","budget","miniseri","grand","bbc","ever","give","time","sure","scrape","togeth","bite","look","like","wrong","effect","mr","beaver","know","comput","effect","level","necessari","even","cost","effect","time","costum","store","man","suit","look","horrid","well","cut","charact","role","avoid","cost"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,8,10,15,16,20,21,25,26,30,34,40,44,45,106,109,119,128,138,145,154,201,203,256,270,296,303,304,335,357,445,474,701,765,776,793,837,888,1110,1744,1769,1898,1923,2212,2245,2486,3114,3292,4486,6082],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,8,10,15,16,20,21,25,26,30,34,40,44,45,106,109,119,128,138,145,154,201,203,256,270,296,303,304,335,357,445,474,701,765,776,793,837,888,1110,1744,1769,1898,1923,2212,2245,2486,3114,3292,4486,6082],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,1.8837873718108231,1.1238870241028365,1.2000607798565692,2.393227744058217,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,2.559277576165403,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,8.636337445266768,2.125691139326857,2.1653408989309972,2.3409902041158843,2.2907365189289424,2.34599021453259,2.348499626138016,2.561435818751577,2.569760528637609,2.748952192422636,2.731603554088023,2.9504565686333644,2.868298950055202,2.871119826396843,2.908534262247101,3.2829611516442836,3.241201430615691,7.293333077447711,7.648184249811207,3.965503778955432,3.770603439954617,3.770603439954617,7.576234044894651,3.9323057095458362,4.2078172463773615,4.869215728622727,4.724033718778229,9.697192882839982,4.828393734102471,5.3064295350454715,5.322690055917252,5.185068678041204,5.649374286172302,5.521540914662417,5.967828017290836,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.859301722369025E-5,6.813047847281253E-5,6.866012797717913E-5,6.826340902626615E-5,6.826452744536703E-5,6.816910727785755E-5,6.837185175427774E-5,6.814028881653473E-5,6.829349302587576E-5,0.3879699486785744,0.5824334638854887,6.803029536711061E-5,6.930004709411331E-5,7.028862749362797E-5,6.807990234880708E-5,6.789175887242703E-5,6.958523387187761E-5,6.837825768069475E-5,6.816611440261164E-5,6.822261199172262E-5,6.888270577610898E-5,6.844600323110812E-5,6.85239393894854E-5,6.859776624859327E-5,6.912421886266177E-5,6.876271865796695E-5,7.165337272038251E-5,6.805052015015594E-5,6.805234066093593E-5,6.822475088116336E-5,6.967485198955544E-5,6.837429574456208E-5,7.339401437752068E-5,6.856662254872979E-5,6.812459008102713E-5,6.843902997244321E-5,6.805632753934488E-5,6.80965438216976E-5,6.789141777874119E-5,6.790903194473796E-5,6.806188692245701E-5,6.877979561051543E-5,6.843029656557255E-5,6.815974230189084E-5,6.898795464071326E-5,6.818590238344348E-5,7.045138132166315E-5,6.941537322392845E-5,6.792591105162344E-5,6.807603146900206E-5,6.805242013651251E-5,6.996767105107303E-5,6.807704431056915E-5,6.790300317449713E-5,6.86483358110214E-5,6.80945791499803E-5,7.322823608798066E-5,6.803846036872364E-5,6.792512552742997E-5,6.824944806579949E-5,6.892642523107278E-5,6.8244

{"value":"This movie certainly proves, that also the good Americans can do terribly good propaganda. No questions being asked, no comments being made on power abuse or police terror, when James Stewart, solid and convincing as always, solves all the stories from Dillinger to 5th Column more or less singlehandedly. June Allyson as his regular love interest holds up the family values and E.J. Hoover is executive producer.And children or non guilty bystanders are never harmed, when the professionals execute. Not to speak of civil rights, which are never broken or homes, which are never intruded. And if the FBI service would not be enough, Steward also gives his son's life for the country in WW II. Perfectly made, if you wouldn't know better....","finished_norm":["thi","movi","certainli","prove","that","conjur","the","good","american","can","do","terribli","good","propaganda","no","question","be","ask","no","comment","be","make","on","power","abus","or","polic","terror","when","jame","stewart","solid","and","convinc","a","alwai","solv","all","the","stori","from","dilling","to","th","column","much","or","littl","singlehandedli","june","allyson","a","hi","regular","love","interest","hold","up","the","famili","valu","and","ej","hoover","be","execut","producerand","child","or","non","guilti","bystand","be","never","harm","when","the","profession","execut","not","to","speak","of","civil","right","which","be","never","break","or","home","which","be","never","intrud","and","if","the","fbi","servic","would","not","be","enough","steward","conjur","give","hi","son","life","for","the","countri","in","ww","ii","perfectli","make","if","you","would","not","know","well"],"filtered":["thi","movi","certainli","prove","conjur","good","american","terribli","good","propaganda","question","ask","comment","make","power","abus","polic","terror","jame","stewart","solid","convinc","alwai","solv","stori","dilling","th","column","much","littl","singlehandedli","june","allyson","hi","regular","love","interest","hold","famili","valu","ej","hoover","execut","producerand","child","non","guilti","bystand","never","harm","profession","execut","speak","civil","right","never","break","home","never","intrud","fbi","servic","enough","steward","conjur","give","hi","son","life","countri","ww","ii","perfectli","make","know","well"],"filtered2":["certainli","prove","conjur","good","american","terribli","good","propaganda","question","ask","comment","make","power","abus","polic","terror","jame","stewart","solid","convinc","alwai","solv","stori","dilling","th","column","littl","singlehandedli","june","allyson","regular","love","interest","hold","famili","valu","ej","hoover","execut","producerand","child","non","guilti","bystand","never","harm","profession","execut","speak","civil","right","never","break","home","never","intrud","fbi","servic","enough","steward","conjur","give","son","life","countri","ww","ii","perfectli","make","know","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,14,17,20,26,30,39,42,54,60,75,93,121,180,182,197,223,280,302,306,344,360,366,378,389,414,434,451,471,478,540,608,620,662,853,1153,1160,1169,1184,1449,1475,1520,1632,1656,1759,1801,2038,2110,2417,2471,2608,2809,4261,5579,5610,6700,7463,7797],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,14,17,20,26,30,39,42,54,60,75,93,121,180,182,197,223,280,302,306,344,360,366,378,389,414,434,451,471,478,540,608,620,662,853,1153,1160,1169,1184,1449,1475,1520,1632,1656,1759,1801,2038,2110,2417,2471,2608,2809,4261,5579,5610,6700,7463,7797],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.357228929984541,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.165345040023057,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,3.1077880109725475,4.865986292236151,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,1.9742250248702675,2.035389827120098,2.2190595059394194,2.7097314792693545,2.7365296724240786,2.558331832813986,2.825563294794476,2.8028805344481915,2.902686292364678,2.8739486825973213,2.983093497946387,3.028335462059722,3.185521045582134,3.130944944345658,3.0914425013694116,3.1254654785810323,3.4101163271295305,3.216957819005698,3.496027715008137,3.3243163373261977,3.432149042129413,3.616452760127359,3.7568101178222815,7.232905520254718,3.8962296530720266,4.213208095012239,4.2574141875167335,4.528289141652134,4.3773181147422555,4.566029469634981,4.4919214974812585,4.550761997504193,4.6973654716960676,4.798834931860927,4.751432692966343,4.85885294158718,4.979216623837056,5.051537285416681,5.501738287366237,5.583416318380505,5.243909178064138,5.390512652256013,6.137727054086234,6.342521466732247,6.660975197850782,6.543192162194399,6.725513718988353,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.56003193312252E-5,5.522539337968119E-5,5.565471815308156E-5,5.533314459868348E-5,5.533405116995956E-5,5.5256705224280226E-5,5.5421046407798127E-5,5.523334547547434E-5,5.535753017104575E-5,0.26248476256124215,0.4969067299740633,5.514418667826936E-5,5.6173425576778434E-5,5.6974751835956624E-5,5.518439724393653E-5,5.5031891379779785E-5,5.6404593071000605E-5,5.542623894151093E-5,5.525427925111084E-5,5.530007522456644E-5,5.5835135886510354E-5,5.548115231882993E-5,5.554432602759236E-5,5.5604168809084724E-5,5.603090223822534E-5,5.5737876393425596E-5,5.8080990830603315E-5,5.516058053935376E-5,5.516205621406251E-5,5.5301808971538545E-5,5.6477235974934994E-5,5.5423027464263503E-5,5.94919250028457E-5,0.05485941701842815,5.52206203506344E-5,5.5475499915360295E-5,5.516528790908985E-5,5.519788653547531E-5,5.503161489510798E-5

{"value":"I wonder who was responsible for this mess. The jokes wouldn't have worked for gilligan's island. If this had gone to series, would there have been jokes about Auschwitz, or would Eva have to replace her oven, only to have Adolf suggest the kind that seats 50?? Another post compared this show to I love Lucy. The problem with this is that Lucille Ball was a genius at physical comedy and bizarre situations, and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence. <br /><br />After the damage the Nazi's did to England and the number of people they killed, I would think the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would seem repugnant and most normal people would have killed this

{"value":"Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films, for there is not much of a plot , bad acting, pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes. But. And this is a big but, there is one good actor, one good recurring joke, and a good beginning. The good actor being Tim Curry, the one good recurring joke is the creepy,weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things. And the good beginning is the spoof of the Excorsist.<br /><br />The plot to Scary Movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion, but will they survive the night? This film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it!","finished_norm":["scari","movi","be","definit","the","wrong","of","the","film","for","there","be","not","much","of","a","plot","bad","act","pretti","tediou","and","some","realli","cheesi","joke","but","and","thi","be","a","big","but","there","be","on","good","actor","on","good","recur","joke","and","a","good","begin","the","good","actor","be","tim","curri","the","on","good","recur","joke","be","the","creepyweird","butler","with","the","disgust","hand","who","alwai","doe","cringei","but","laugh","worthi","thing","and","the","good","begin","be","the","spoof","of","the","excorsistbr","br","the","plot","to","scari","movi","be","the","main","charact","from","the","origin","and","a","host","of","new","charact","along","the","wai","be","invit","to","stai","the","night","at","a","creepi","old","mansion","but","will","thei","surviv","the","night","thi","film","be","not","veri","good","but","if","your","bore","you","mai","a","good","watch","it"],"filtered":["scari","movi","definit","wrong","film","much","plot","bad","act","pretti","tediou","realli","cheesi","joke","thi","big","good","actor","good","recur","joke","good","begin","good","actor","tim","curri","good","recur","joke","creepyweird","butler","disgust","hand","alwai","doe","cringei","laugh","worthi","thing","good","begin","spoof","excorsistbr","br","plot","scari","movi","main","charact","origin","host","new","charact","along","wai","invit","stai","night","creepi","old","mansion","thei","surviv","night","thi","film","veri","good","bore","mai","good","watch"],"filtered2":["scari","definit","wrong","plot","bad","act","pretti","tediou","realli","cheesi","joke","big","good","actor","good","recur","joke","good","begin","good","actor","tim","curri","good","recur","joke","creepyweird","butler","disgust","hand","alwai","doe","cringei","laugh","worthi","thing","good","begin","spoof","excorsistbr","plot","scari","main","charact","origin","host","new","charact","along","wai","invit","stai","night","creepi","old","mansion","surviv","night","veri","good","bore","mai","good","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,9,10,13,15,18,21,25,29,32,33,41,46,67,69,78,82,87,108,133,147,179,197,210,214,235,324,365,392,396,543,755,885,963,1235,1337,1445,1548,1919,2115,2123,4040,7044,7126],"values":[8.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,9,10,13,15,18,21,25,29,32,33,41,46,67,69,78,82,87,108,133,147,179,197,210,214,235,324,365,392,396,543,755,885,963,1235,1337,1445,1548,1919,2115,2123,4040,7044,7126],"values":[5.428915719938164,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,2.247774048205673,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3195384777338066,2.742262257014735,1.4018535447685214,3.1375198335242067,1.655771293751733,1.9570915389266579,2.127032521151058,2.0064197866819473,2.020196584395323,2.115024371522662,2.138507503627933,2.3212364753796515,4.568864643066313,2.507968722980095,2.558331832813986,5.374303583034378,8.191127420549101,2.6457189377809835,2.8753661172782943,3.008694896185175,3.0670934723591254,6.583053029006414,3.477726550625732,3.79165684915245,3.9782428047328615,4.035401218572811,4.297765483040301,4.396611317676934,4.798834931860927,4.724033718778229,4.869215728622727,5.116075806554253,5.051537285416681,5.9370563586240825,6.794506590475304,13.451027437976705]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.835922970174985E-5,7.783083509697849E-5,7.843589562433121E-5,7.798269218380824E-5,7.798396984242096E-5,7.787496383675613E-5,0.046863346980584884,7.784204222867054E-5,7.801705951639064E-5,8.655566874996076E-5,0.6587460538885089,7.771638801023887E-5,7.916692585312056E-5,8.02962594462412E-5,7.777305798964637E-5,7.755812681327791E-5,7.949271726937885E-5,0.11345259730335172,7.787154483860797E-5,7.793608650395426E-5,7.869016385131379E-5,7.819128398831744E-5,7.828031662725854E-5,7.836465488857349E-5,7.896606335524511E-5,7.855309307454535E-5,8.185531587845617E-5,7.773949237981557E-5,7.77415720932931E-5,0.039857868388563755,7.959509513454338E-5,7.81093668539352E-5,8.38437885388047E-5,7.832907697656233E-5,7.782410832123422E-5,7.818331788331712E-5,7.77461266198861E-5,7.779206886057149E-5,7.755773715497796E-5,7.757785921018432E-5,7.775247754299627E-5,7.857260142833286E-5,7.817334102178286E-5,7.786426548388246E-5,7.88103979551801E-5,7.789415021446247E-5,8.048218601882887E-5,0.04630761964254198,7.759714154922018E-5,7.776863597743484E-5,7.774166288453123E-5,7.992960551229335E-5,7.776979302647887E-5,7.757097206902562E-5,7.842242450009679E-5,7.778982446065126E-5,8.365440688458667E-5,7.772571553748299E-5,7.759624418279422E-5,7.796674347426982E-5,7.874010804319518E-5,7.796158553070683E-5,7.758188870414436E-5,7.776252624975875E-5,7.755867522953783E-5,7.935322221915585E-5,7.822680680900056E-5,7.806017225708496E-5,7.799190510847941E-5,7.82

{"value":"- Bad Stuff: This movie is real crap. Bad stunts for one thing, they looked so fake I thought this was \"The Twilight Zone\". The flashbacks are pretty much useless. One part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better. I wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting, even from the adults was horrid. A kissing scene in this movie even sucked. This movie killed the book. The book was great. I highly do not recommend this movie.

{"value":"The story of the film was as simple minded as its morality: Go find a girl, marry her, live with her happily ever after. Though the film had some fine moments and turns, most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same storyline.<br /><br />The Baptist/Mormon struggle was only touched superficially and was mocked about, probably intentionally. A more interesting story would have been a mixed couple.<br /><br />If you wanna see a film which doesn't need too much concentration, which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values (besides the modern tolerance stuff ;-) ), you will be fine with this film.

{"value":"Seldom do I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show. This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD. Syriana was one in which I did give up. Half way through I turned it off in bored disgust.<br /><br />This movie is disjointed, boring, confusing and lackluster. The acting was dry and without credible portrayals. The general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest. The multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot. Too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop.

{"value":"What can I say about Seven Pounds...well I watched on a flight from Seattle to Tokyo and as that flight was long and boring the movie definitely didn't help. Will Smith's character Ben Thomas is almost completely unlikable even with his redemption in the end. The movie's two hour plus run time wastes most of the screen time with random garbage that just strings the plot along as slow as possible. In the movies defense Rosario Dawson's character adds a little life to the film although not much. I don't understand how anyone could actually cry during this film when all I wanted to do was turn it off. Also Will Smith kills himself with a jellyfish at the ended proving that killing yourself with a jellyfish is the stupidest way to die.","finished_norm":["what","can","i","sai","about","seven","poundswel","i","watch","on","a","flight","from","seattl","to","tokyo","and","a","that","flight","be","long","and","bore","the","movi","definit","do","not","help","will","smith","charact","ben","thoma","be","almost","complet","unlik","even","with","hi","redempt","in","the","end","the","movi","two","hour","plu","run","time","wast","much","of","the","screen","time","with","random","garbag","that","just","string","the","plot","along","a","slow","a","possibl","in","the","movi","defens","rosario","dawson","charact","add","a","littl","life","to","the","film","although","not","much","i","do","not","understand","how","anyon","can","actual","cry","dure","thi","film","when","all","i","want","to","do","be","turn","it","off","conjur","will","smith","kill","himself","with","a","jellyfish","at","the","end","prove","that","kill","yourself","with","a","jellyfish","be","the","stupid","wai","to","die"],"filtered":["sai","seven","poundswel","watch","flight","seattl","tokyo","flight","long","bore","movi","definit","help","smith","charact","ben","thoma","almost","complet","unlik","even","hi","redempt","end","movi","two","hour","plu","run","time","wast","much","screen","time","random","garbag","string","plot","along","slow","possibl","movi","defens","rosario","dawson","charact","add","littl","life","film","although","much","understand","anyon","actual","cry","dure","thi","film","want","turn","conjur","smith","kill","jellyfish","end","prove","kill","jellyfish","stupid","wai","die"],"filtered2":["seven","poundswel","watch","flight","seattl","tokyo","flight","long","bore","definit","help","smith","charact","ben","thoma","almost","complet","unlik","even","redempt","end","two","hour","plu","run","time","wast","screen","time","random","garbag","string","plot","along","slow","possibl","defens","rosario","dawson","charact","add","littl","life","although","understand","anyon","actual","cry","dure","want","turn","conjur","smith","kill","jellyfish","end","prove","kill","jellyfish","stupid","wai","die"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,8,10,14,24,32,33,37,39,47,52,75,76,89,96,99,103,108,131,136,137,158,174,185,192,212,237,239,293,299,324,390,392,402,540,615,702,749,854,856,859,1508,1528,1729,1945,2131,3015,3071,3490,4322,4612,5870],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[5,7,8,10,14,24,32,33,37,39,47,52,75,76,89,96,99,103,108,131,136,137,158,174,185,192,212,237,239,293,299,324,390,392,402,540,615,702,749,854,856,859,1508,1528,1729,1945,2131,3015,3071,3490,4322,4612,5870],"values":[0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.8837873718108231,2.247774048205673,1.1175081997259209,2.6420723132238515,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.4876543214774305,1.5538940054862738,1.7064694353107215,1.7122153074726136,1.9742250248702675,4.267533106664805,1.9940046109572438,2.0390708128715254,2.056430207256609,2.098582041218749,2.138507503627933,2.2512118082053005,2.346825985579986,2.2939035841256437,2.3106972614914807,2.456282578459816,2.518833027372001,2.5318267134339894,2.5983793339432615,2.640097787510554,2.6593400337329487,2.9012296278682137,2.7949961309240425,2.8753661172782943,3.132778125427319,3.0670934723591254,3.084424928710765,3.432149042129413,3.5013187326425523,3.6466665387238555,3.7165362186843414,4.291900363587903,3.900174431363043,3.9405024767500145,4.751432692966343,9.697192882839982,4.6973654716960676,5.014723312293965,10.457742601399195,5.444579873526289,5.482320201509136,6.137727054086234,6.2980697041614135,6.948657270302562,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.98945260115023E-5,6.942321088260046E-5,6.996291014876928E-5,6.955866370858985E-5,6.95598033489804E-5,6.946257264460327E-5,6.966916406825543E-5,6.943320737134271E-5,6.958931853291966E-5,7.720555018105304E-5,0.7036704148114606,6.932112686631407E-5,7.061497132312984E-5,0.10659369523047853,6.937167510887394E-5,6.917996172993253E-5,7.090556933825403E-5,6.967569154304372E-5,6.945952298145689E-5,6.951709257631562E-5,7.018971121958603E-5,6.974472252210226E-5,6.982413746941641E-5,6.989936514612634E-5,0.04821192485636201,7.006744742234449E-5,7.301294980339414E-5,6.934173540172853E-5,6.934359045554037E-5,6.951927204982038E-5,7.099688790260159E-5,6.967165443169786E-5,7.478661902667376E-5,6.986763051440569E-5,6.941721076233357E-5,6.973761695029822E-5,6.934765298242631E-5,6.938863234310703E-5,6.917961416421137E-5,6.91975625477825E-5,6.935331785129002E-5,7.008484839918451E-5,6.972871783259794E-5,6.945302997418583E-5,0.05043845897724841,6.947968642661423E-5,7.178815138390755E-5,7.073248569276143E-5,6.921476192496415E-5,6.936773078159152E-5,6.934367143911537E-5,7.129526301919926E-5,0.08583572558694466,6.919141938546846E-5,6.995089423377381E-5,6.938663039299596E-5,7.46176

{"value":"An awful film! It must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the Golden Globe. They've taken the story of the first famous female Renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. My complaint is not that they've taken liberties with the facts; if the story were good, that would perfectly fine. But it's simply bizarre -- by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film, so why did they come up with this dishwater-dull script? I suppose there weren't enough naked people in the factual version. It's hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist's life -- we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they'd favored the rest of the film with same brevity.","finished_norm":["a","aw","film","it","must","have","be","up","against","some","real","stinker","to","be","nomin","for","the","golden","globe","thei","have","take","the","stori","of","the","famou","femal","renaiss","painter","and","mangl","it","beyond","recognit","my","complaint","be","not","that","thei","have","take","liberti","with","the","fact","if","the","stori","be","good","that","would","perfectli","fine","but","it","simpli","bizarr","by","all","account","the","true","stori","of","thi","artist","would","have","make","for","a","far","well","film","so","why","do","thei","come","up","with","thi","dishwaterdul","script","i","suppos","there","be","not","enough","nake","peopl","in","the","factual","version","it","hurriedli","cap","off","in","the","end","with","a","summari","of","the","artist","life","we","can","have","save","ourselv","a","coupl","of","hour","if","thei","have","favor","the","rest","of","the","film","with","same","breviti"],"filtered":["aw","film","must","real","stinker","nomin","golden","globe","thei","take","stori","famou","femal","renaiss","painter","mangl","beyond","recognit","complaint","thei","take","liberti","fact","stori","good","perfectli","fine","simpli","bizarr","account","true","stori","thi","artist","make","far","well","film","thei","come","thi","dishwaterdul","script","suppos","enough","nake","peopl","factual","version","hurriedli","cap","end","summari","artist","life","save","ourselv","coupl","hour","thei","favor","rest","film","breviti"],"filtered2":["aw","must","real","stinker","nomin","golden","globe","take","stori","famou","femal","renaiss","painter","mangl","beyond","recognit","complaint","take","liberti","fact","stori","good","perfectli","fine","simpli","bizarr","account","true","stori","artist","make","far","well","come","dishwaterdul","script","suppos","enough","nake","peopl","factual","version","hurriedli","cap","end","summari","artist","life","save","ourselv","coupl","hour","favor","rest","breviti"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,17,20,23,24,31,34,75,77,80,93,97,101,138,141,149,174,189,201,220,226,253,304,422,464,502,724,825,865,893,1115,1475,1501,1795,1839,1929,2266,2561,3279,3722,5090,5353,5397,5664,6515,6923,7031],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,17,20,23,24,31,34,75,77,80,93,97,101,138,141,149,174,189,201,220,226,253,304,422,464,502,724,825,865,893,1115,1475,1501,1795,1839,1929,2266,2561,3279,3722,5090,5353,5397,5664,6515,6923,7031],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6786144649922705,3.83116108203179,1.165345040023057,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,2.814133962290301,1.3982850089458962,1.9742250248702675,1.9463902258768238,1.9951803900462557,2.035389827120098,2.0545557924622586,2.098582041218749,2.2907365189289424,2.2657547357741192,2.3253197803590226,2.456282578459816,2.498193474075453,2.561435818751577,2.8336934208777267,2.5940874818617203,2.7073305177318163,2.871119826396843,3.2090054908152035,3.2872346624216657,3.3132665011396125,7.597548633842627,3.850067611308864,3.9201351739255808,4.017463517886143,4.1554492608600455,4.4919214974812585,4.597282013139085,4.8796870284900224,4.760735085628657,4.8184434032493035,5.089758498236879,5.290429193699031,5.5623629091826725,5.850044981634453,6.255510089742618,6.214688095222362,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141,7.0356686472921925,6.600350576034347,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.0280462297258E-5,6.980654470975677E-5,7.034922403090408E-5,6.994274546499814E-5,6.994389139813584E-5,6.984612381542144E-5,7.005385597399611E-5,6.981659639606534E-5,6.997356955593174E-5,7.763185571564807E-5,0.09481877700484108,6.970389701662285E-5,7.100488568847955E-5,7.20177859851573E-5,6.975472437118331E-5,6.956195240935109E-5,7.129708829733954E-5,7.00604194915122E-5,6.984305731296396E-5,6.990094478959227E-5,7.057727742815999E-5,7.012983163861322E-5,7.020968509108004E-5,7.028532815210963E-5,7.082473193680793E-5,7.04543385274664E-5,7.34161050755903E-5,6.97246193460934E-5,6.972648464294743E-5,6.990313629748596E-5,7.13889110949877E-5,7.0056360088467E-5,7.519956796013717E-5,7.025341829141762E-5,6.980051145865314E-5,7.012268683200572E-5,6.973056960186955E-5,6.977177523809939E-5,6.956160292447786E-5,6.957965041355676E-5,6.973626575041385E-5,7.047183558720094E-5,7.011373857608779E-5,6.983652845328424E-5,7.068511550206377E-5,6.986333209452455E-5,7.218454369225245E-5,7.112304893667038E-5,6.959694476046101E-5,6.975075826452691E-5,6.972656607368905E-5,7.168893374810693E-5,6.975179602283599E-5,6.957347333057136E-5,7.033714176768554E-5,6.976976223382952E-5,7.50297113872775E-5,6.971226288404271E-5,6.959613991172136E-5,6.992844105333315E-5,7.062207241795056E-5,0.05038484138756444,6.958326447024688E-5,6.974527844438039E-5,6.956244428437876E-5,7.117197506364433E-5,7.016169208784447E-5

{"value":"After what I thought was a masterful performance of two roles in Man From Snowy River, WHY was Kirk Douglas replaced by Brian Dennehy in the sequel? It just wasn't the same without Spur and Harrison, as portrayed by Douglas. Maybe he recognized how poor the plot was--Jim returns after extended absence, to find Jessica being pursued by another man. He could not expect any girl to wait that long with no contact from him, and not find competition. For a Disney movie, this contains foul language, plus the highly unnecessary part when Jim & Jessica shacked up without being married--very LAME.

{"value":"I can see where the film makers were going with this. But they never really reach their destination. It's supposed to be a homage to Spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame.\" But unfortunately it fall short in its attempt. It doesn't have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for. The characters are not vile and desperate enough like their Italian western counterparts. And, failing these two points, it lacks the humor of a successful parody. In fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film, but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously. Unfortunately, they also missed the humor mark by a mile.

{"value":"Just bought the VHS on this film for two bucks, Did I waste my money! Hey, I dig Adam \"Batman\" West and Tina \"Giligan's Island\" Louise, but hello! This third rate production is a rehash of a dozen other biker films; crazed bunch of bikers psychos ride into a hick town, beat up everybody and everything, and then are defeated in the man by a dashing hero. Adam West looks the part as a hero, but he's missing cape, and his Batman uniform. Sorry, just isn't the same. Tina L. looks really nervous and frightened the whole show, but at least we know what happened to \"Ginger\" once she was rescued from the island...LOL! The bikers are a motley group, and known of them ever acted again or at least shouldn't have.
