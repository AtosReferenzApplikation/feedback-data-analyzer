{"value":"He only gets third billing (behind Arthur Treacher & Virginia Field), but this was effectively David Niven's first starring role and he's charmingly silly as P. G. Wodehouse's dunderheaded Bertie Wooster, master (in name only) to Jeeves, that most unflappable of valets. As an adaptation, it's more like a watered-down THE 39 STEPS than a true Wodehousian outing. And that's too bad since the interplay between Treacher & Niven isn't too far off the mark. Alas, the 'B' movie mystery tropes & forced comedy grow wearisome even at a brief 57 minutes. Next year's follow-up (STEP LIVELY, JEEVES) was even more off the mark, with no Bertie in sight and Jeeves (of all people!) forced to play the

{"value":"Based upon the recommendation of a friend, my wife and I invited another couple to this film. I really apologized to them--all 4 of us hated it and spent the whole time looking at our watches waiting for the film to finally end. Half the vignettes are bizarre, with very little entertainment value. There were few scenes of Paris--for example, I was looking forward to seeing some pictures of the Latin Quarter, but I couldn't really recognize anything. Most of the scene was inside a bar. No one in the theater laughed at anything, or reacted in any way. If you like bizarre, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual films, don't miss this. If you are down to earth like me, you will be sorry you saw

{"value":"It must be the most corniest TV show on the air. This is probably a escape for Jim Belushi and all of his bad movies. His brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother. I hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use. Jim has got to retire or something. Please let them go of the air. If i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush. Id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing. I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running. We all know deep down that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim's face.

{"value":"ok. for starters, taxi driver is amazing. this, this is not taxi driver or amazing. what it is is bad. but i thought it was bad funny, which means that it did have some redeeming qualities. like the dialogue...wow. there was more or less no plot, the characters were all stupid, and the movie was preachy. there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence, which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder. i can't even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie. yeah, it's worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie, or at least can try to.","finished_norm":["okai","for","starter","taxi","driver","be","amaz","thi","thi","be","not","taxi","driver","or","amaz","what","it","be","be","bad","but","i","think","it","be","bad","funni","which","mean","that","it","do","have","some","redeem","qualiti","like","the","dialoguewow","there","be","much","or","littl","no","plot","the","charact","be","all","stupid","and","the","movi","be","preachi","there","be","some","place","be","i","think","the","movi","would","diva","into","taxi","driver","typ","violenc","which","would","have","hit","the","messag","at","the","end","of","the","movi","on","the","head","much","hard","i","ca","not","even","believ","that","there","be","like","other","peopl","who","have","see","thi","movi","ye","it","worth","watch","if","you","be","real","bore","and","you","want","to","reaffirm","the","fact","that","anyon","can","make","a","movi","or","at","littl","can","try","to"],"filtered":["okai","starter","taxi","driver","amaz","thi","thi","taxi","driver","amaz","bad","think","bad","funni","mean","redeem","qualiti","like","dialoguewow","much","littl","plot","charact","stupid","movi","preachi","place","think","movi","diva","taxi","driver","typ","violenc","hit","messag","end","movi","head","much","hard","ca","even","believ","like","peopl","see","thi","movi","ye","worth","watch","real","bore","want","reaffirm","fact","anyon","make","movi","littl","try"],"filtered2":["okai","starter","taxi","driver","amaz","taxi","driver","amaz","bad","think","bad","funni","mean","redeem","qualiti","like","dialoguewow","littl","plot","charact","stupid","preachi","place","think","diva","taxi","driver","typ","violenc","hit","messag","end","head","hard","ca","even","believ","like","peopl","see","ye","worth","watch","real","bore","want","reaffirm","fact","anyon","make","littl","try"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,7,9,10,12,14,23,24,32,36,37,62,80,81,88,91,97,108,136,158,164,171,191,208,209,219,319,384,388,453,569,634,685,1735,2952,4074,4102,4457],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,7,9,10,12,14,23,24,32,36,37,62,80,81,88,91,97,108,136,158,164,171,191,208,209,219,319,384,388,453,569,634,685,1735,2952,4074,4102,4457],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,1.1238870241028365,2.133457220525776,2.2350163994518417,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,1.4680183469605717,1.4876543214774305,2.0226120445069267,1.9951803900462557,1.949757232424728,2.0317223413467334,2.0105926690411424,2.0545557924622586,2.138507503627933,2.346825985579986,2.3106972614914807,2.3930275298746078,2.373087554090762,2.5460113484259455,2.6289494000279396,2.6026896854443837,2.5792094178355414,2.9056060024680126,3.109204957709252,3.0914425013694116,3.41740676039221,3.6436037491933098,3.5119855004467477,7.215127625420226,14.735326029124568,16.62523086593981,5.822646007446338,5.9370563586240825,5.967828017290836]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006082E-4,2.407566716068782E-4,2.4081611628889944E-4,2.4076770454651008E-4,2.407904903538248E-4,2.4075534414722298E-4,2.4083022240173438E-4,2.407195236787006E-4,2.407567224883395E-4,2.41005518472542E-4,2.4291782712185028E-4,2.4075712015618708E-4,2.409851323632681E-4,2.4101023885640503E-4,2.4090075419782667E-4,2.407686528956508E-4,2.408514866239234E-4,2.4096483215235837E-4,2.4078108274307988E-4,2.4078020242355186E-4,2.4099682081796462E-4,2.4080432614165327E-4,2.4080469057813212E-4,2.409589526411718E-4,2.4078116959887932E-4,2.4101311952363043E-4,2.4084142415433342E-4,2.4075613202122114E-4,2.4086528056278388E-4,2.4093879611840707E-4,2.4080550732584634E-4,2.4093447751165545E-4,2.410527703252278E-4,2.412765046734122E-4,2.408410079735815E-4,2.4076850686564604E-4,2.4085531750952724E-4,2.4079295915591965E-4,2.4071978060217076E-4,2.4078100817709683E-4,2.4102231189432867E-4,2.4089009598459953E-4,2.4093502655981764E-4,2.4073176119878182E-4,2.407810694016076E-4,2.4076841632749468E-4,2.4084991425345298E-4,2.4089167792962197E-4,2.4084269396814216E-4,2.4080451997563954E-4,2.4076901172928743E-4,2.4126230833403927E-4,2.408295961481616E-4,2.4078101421489217E-4,2.4082830641647602E-4,2.4075637834747302E-4,0.9809713522425213,2.4079394036305158E-4,2.4076934973816353E-4,2.4075624091759253E-4,2.4094885168561979E-4,2.4085212877650376E-4,2.407561402751623E-4,2.4073166311921874E-4,2.4070745489132748E-4,2.4092509253415933E-4,2.4076793474448399E-4,2.4087737889248658E-4,2.4094807029668812E-4,2.4083875684592353E-4,2.407813331213692E-4,2.4073197870238755E-4,2.4079356239037117E-4,2.407318490411623E-4,2.407444822592774E-4,2.4073198551570257E-4,2.4088825421425384E-4,2.4081655816085958E-4,2.4075646162263962E-4,2.4077978339942242E-4]}}
{"value":"Its not the cast. A finer group of actors, you could not find. Its not the setting. The director is in love with New York City, and by the end of the film, so are we all! Woody Allen could not improve upon what Bogdonovich has done here. If you are going to fall in love, or find love, Manhattan is the place to go. No, the problem with the movie is the script. There is none. The actors fall in love at first sight, words are unnecessary. In the director's own experience in Hollywood that is what happens when they go to work on the set. It is reality to him, and his peers, but it is a fantasy to most of us in the real world. So, in the end, the movie is hollow, and shallow, and message-less.","finished_norm":["it","not","the","cast","a","fine","group","of","actor","you","can","not","find","it","not","the","set","the","director","be","in","love","with","new","york","citi","and","by","the","end","of","the","film","so","be","we","all","woodi","allen","can","not","improv","upon","what","bogdonovich","have","do","here","if","you","be","go","to","fall","in","love","or","find","love","manhattan","be","the","place","to","go","no","the","problem","with","the","movi","be","the","script","there","be","none","the","actor","fall","in","love","at","sight","word","be","unnecessari","in","the","director","own","experi","in","hollywood","that","be","what","happen","when","thei","go","to","work","on","the","set","it","be","realiti","to","him","and","hi","peer","but","it","be","a","fantasi","to","much","of","u","in","the","real","world","so","in","the","end","the","movi","be","hollow","and","shallow","and","messageless"],"filtered":["cast","fine","group","actor","find","set","director","love","new","york","citi","end","film","woodi","allen","improv","upon","bogdonovich","go","fall","love","find","love","manhattan","place","go","problem","movi","script","none","actor","fall","love","sight","word","unnecessari","director","experi","hollywood","happen","thei","go","work","set","realiti","hi","peer","fantasi","much","u","real","world","end","movi","hollow","shallow","messageless"],"filtered2":["cast","fine","group","actor","find","set","director","love","new","york","citi","end","woodi","allen","improv","upon","bogdonovich","go","fall","love","find","love","manhattan","place","go","problem","script","none","actor","fall","love","sight","word","unnecessari","director","experi","hollywood","happen","go","work","set","realiti","peer","fantasi","u","real","world","end","hollow","shallow","messageless"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,24,38,41,48,54,58,77,80,87,92,94,109,112,164,165,167,169,258,300,333,370,410,464,595,630,656,827,996,1081,1117,1150,1280,1345,1761,2316,3952,5347],"values":[3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[6,24,38,41,48,54,58,77,80,87,92,94,109,112,164,165,167,169,258,300,333,370,410,464,595,630,656,827,996,1081,1117,1150,1280,1345,1761,2316,3952,5347],"values":[2.912480743411154,2.6420723132238515,3.038623282696244,3.1375198335242067,1.6955116224012472,7.245557301091765,3.731402629253362,1.9463902258768238,1.9951803900462557,2.115024371522662,2.0489535369135887,2.08112281984698,4.251382278653714,2.2466628996789315,2.3930275298746078,2.448847599972298,2.4609576687888097,4.814274222781855,2.7061321952397077,2.932274249550174,2.948928684455311,2.9958122703541616,3.2070272508030975,3.2872346624216657,3.6284289511740746,3.558633189238533,3.68099128126493,4.062925891962901,4.1302590120314875,4.1302590120314875,4.181290492043933,4.246178114249808,4.364659717870332,4.760735085628657,5.156897801074508,5.185068678041204,5.967828017290836,6.214688095222362]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815707E-4,2.4557311712357507E-4,2.4563375102320054E-4,2.455843707821273E-4,2.456076124297672E-4,2.455717631074923E-4,2.456481393351682E-4,2.4553522603438377E-4,2.455731690229429E-4,2.4582694228272693E-4,2.4777750751927874E-4,2.4557357464631465E-4,2.458061483401666E-4,2.458317570999926E-4,2.457200821515691E-4,2.4558533810341916E-4,2.4566982895768755E-4,2.4578544201440586E-4,2.455980166155375E-4,2.455971186848213E-4,2.4581807062765723E-4,2.456217250087551E-4,2.4562209673594963E-4,2.4577944488095315E-4,2.455981052089263E-4,2.4583469539626163E-4,2.4565956518386695E-4,2.4557256674326424E-4,2.4568389885049996E-4,2.457588851178834E-4,2.4562292982306926E-4,2.45754480115461E-4,2.4587513942998134E-4,2.461033496844451E-4,2.4565914067723187E-4,2.4558518915201847E-4,2.4567373648188114E-4,2.4561013062135857E-4,2.4553548809772355E-4,2.455979405578284E-4,2.4584407166447074E-4,2.457092107159919E-4,2.457550401475787E-4,2.455477083715591E-4,2.45598003007163E-4,2.455850968026107E-4,2.4566822513123857E-4,2.4571082430853615E-4,2.456608604008721E-4,2.456219227204774E-4,2.4558570411568415E-4,2.4608886934091695E-4,2.45647500553111E-4,2.455979467164125E-4,2.4564618501976283E-4,2.455728179973836E-4,0.9805906755843552,2.4561113145798053E-4,2.4558604888657985E-4,2.4557267781815653E-4,2.4576914185124154E-4,2.4567048395681914E-4,2.4557257516232917E-4,2.4554760832987024E-4,2.455229158054903E-4,2.4574490738726835E-4,2.455846055853152E-4,2.456962392127306E-4,2.457683448302728E-4,2.456568445147524E-4,2.455982720027571E-4,2.455479302264223E-4,2.4561074592378666E-4,2.455477979712659E-4,2.455606839225923E-4,2.4554793717604075E-4,2.4570733210020195E-4,2.4563420173500804E-4,2.4557290293850733E-4,2.4559669127792563E-4]}}

{"value":"I saw this movie at Sundance 2005 and was stunned at how bad it was, although based on the catalog description I was excited to see it. Supposedly a \"mockumentary\" of two high school students making a documentary of high school life, it featured bad acting, bad directing, completely lack of engaging characters as written, and all-around is a total bust. I love good movies about high school, and this is not one of them. The characters are one-dimensional and self-consciously \"cool\" although they are supposed to be outcasts. You get the overall impression of a bunch of people sitting around making an on-purposely-bad movie to show their friends, yet somehow it got into Sundance.

{"value":"Watched on Hulu (far too many commercials!) so it broke the pacing but even still, it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis where both parts are played by Jerry Lewis. If I were Indian, I'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews. They cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them I usually enjoy Indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment, especially for a modern Indian film. The story doesn't take place in India (the uncle keeps referring to when Mac will return to India) but I can't find out where it is supposed to be happening.","finished_norm":["watch","on","hulu","far","too","mani","commerci","so","it","break","the","pace","but","even","still","it","be","like","watch","a","realli","bad","buddi","movi","from","the","earli","sixti","dean","martin","and","jerri","lewi","where","both","part","be","plai","by","jerri","lewi","if","i","be","indian","i","have","protest","the","portray","of","all","male","a","venal","and","all","woman","a","shrew","thei","cheat","for","the","music","video","for","western","sale","and","us","a","lot","of","western","model","so","the","male","can","touch","them","i","usual","enjoi","indian","film","a","lot","but","thi","be","a","major","disappoint","especi","for","a","modern","indian","film","the","stori","doe","not","take","place","in","india","the","uncl","keep","refer","to","when","mac","will","return","to","india","but","i","ca","not","find","out","where","it","be","suppos","to","be","happen"],"filtered":["watch","hulu","far","mani","commerci","break","pace","even","still","like","watch","realli","bad","buddi","movi","earli","sixti","dean","martin","jerri","lewi","part","plai","jerri","lewi","indian","protest","portray","male","venal","woman","shrew","thei","cheat","music","video","western","sale","us","lot","western","model","male","touch","usual","enjoi","indian","film","lot","thi","major","disappoint","especi","modern","indian","film","stori","doe","take","place","india","uncl","keep","refer","mac","return","india","ca","find","suppos","happen"],"filtered2":["watch","hulu","far","mani","commerci","break","pace","even","still","like","watch","realli","bad","buddi","earli","sixti","dean","martin","jerri","lewi","part","plai","jerri","lewi","indian","protest","portray","male","venal","woman","shrew","cheat","music","video","western","sale","us","lot","western","model","male","touch","usual","enjoi","indian","lot","major","disappoint","especi","modern","indian","stori","doe","take","place","india","uncl","keep","refer","mac","return","india","ca","find","suppos","happen"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,9,13,17,18,31,38,40,50,56,61,64,70,72,81,94,101,118,134,149,164,187,200,240,265,266,267,360,404,488,546,649,715,729,745,769,1025,1105,1126,1233,1302,1405,1422,1431,1670,1847,2237,2991,3084,3453,3616,6008],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,7,9,13,17,18,31,38,40,50,56,61,64,70,72,81,94,101,118,134,149,164,187,200,240,265,266,267,360,404,488,546,649,715,729,745,769,1025,1105,1126,1233,1302,1405,1422,1431,1670,1847,2237,2991,3084,3453,3616,6008],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.4070669811451506,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.717994385570355,1.8610609350701788,1.8818517047392527,1.883428577602134,2.094675786251684,3.841892750832105,1.949757232424728,2.08112281984698,2.098582041218749,2.354379525480895,2.2443961816702407,2.3253197803590226,2.3930275298746078,2.4732161909892554,2.5308211829319704,2.7666071276613566,2.73529586597515,2.747702973022204,2.7085302779237206,3.028335462059722,3.1419947805322432,3.3933092088131493,3.4572130107926293,7.275012338650383,3.68099128126493,3.7952092507568174,3.6969916226113715,8.107333133100207,13.309054938979344,4.390138803171316,4.240607069200353,4.470719289830655,4.4919214974812585,4.4919214974812585,4.484804029712395,9.780538275641119,4.9227044135737135,5.156897801074508,10.645380111834504,11.253802860640487,5.463272006538442,5.672363804397,5.719991853386255,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.92012714653786E-4,1.9184256248006725E-4,1.918899298906925E-4,1.918513538767772E-4,1.9186951033173342E-4,1.9184150471805324E-4,1.9190117008941607E-4,1.9181296183105992E-4,1.9184260302403165E-4,1.920408515661202E-4,1.9356463982783104E-4,1.9184291989840272E-4,1.9202460726677845E-4,1.9204461291790384E-4,1.91957372064665E-4,1.9185210955149256E-4,1.9191811409701785E-4,1.9200843141398147E-4,1.9186201404870176E-4,1.918613125821425E-4,1.9203392099871141E-4,1.9188053512690618E-4,1.918808255214672E-4,1.92003746432732E-4,1.9186208325816135E-4,1.9204690832504037E-4,1.9191009600165985E-4,1.9184213252107824E-4,1.919291055456038E-4,1.9198768507521253E-4,1.9188147633198617E-4,1.919842438721919E-4,1.9207850334308101E-4,1.9225678197762116E-4,1.9190976437561864E-4,1.918519931901468E-4,1.919211666683377E-4,1.918714775516529E-4,1.9181316655584094E-4,1.9186195463215822E-4,1.920542330979667E-4,1.9194887926185581E-4,1.9198468137120555E-4,1.9182271307572994E-4,1.918620034177929E-4,1.9185192104647226E-4,1.9191686118228782E-4,1.91950139805893E-4,1.9191110782963252E-4,1.918806895799827E-4,1.9185239548153097E-4,1.9224546988352647E-4,1.9190067107067917E-4,1.9186195944326533E-4,1.9189964337150962E-4,1.

{"value":"Think \"stage play\". This is worth seeing once for the performances of Lionel Atwill and Dwight Frye. COmpare the Melvyn DOuglas in \"Ghost Story\" with the Melvyn DOuglas of this film. Are there vampires at loose in this 'Bavarian' village, or is there a more natural, albeit equally sinister, explanation? Dwight Frye is Herman, a red herring, who is cast as an especially moronic character. It's fun to look at his different facial expressions in what is really a stock character. NOt much happens for a long time, but then we discover that Atwill's pipe smoking doctor is the real murderer. There is too much 'comic relief' but that is par for the course for this era. Fay Wray looks really

{"value":"This was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot. Aside from the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the \"special effects\" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible. The movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny. You can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about. It's now a running joke among my friends and I. 1 out of

{"value":"Caught this movie on the tube on a Sunday. I thought it was so bad I looked it up on IMDb to see what others thought of it. I was not surprised at the amount of silly people who enjoyed this fluff. I was however surprised when I looked into the comments to read the Hated It categories only to find that their were none. I was shocked at this; I always look at the hated it's as their are always those who hate a movie no matter how good it is. Somehow this movie made it through unscathed by the haters I say nay to that and proclaim proudly that I HATE THIS MOVIE! I know I should go into detail about why I hate this movie but to do so would only grant this movie more respect than it deserves.","finished_norm":["catch","thi","movi","on","the","tube","on","a","sundai","i","think","it","be","so","bad","i","look","it","up","on","imdb","to","see","what","other","think","of","it","i","be","not","surpris","at","the","amount","of","silli","peopl","who","enjoi","thi","fluff","i","be","howev","surpris","when","i","look","into","the","comment","to","read","the","hate","it","categori","onli","to","find","that","their","be","none","i","be","shock","at","thi","i","alwai","look","at","the","hate","it","a","their","be","alwai","that","who","hate","a","movi","no","matt","how","good","it","be","somehow","thi","movi","make","it","through","unscath","by","the","hater","i","sai","nai","to","that","and","proclaim","proudli","that","i","hate","thi","movi","i","know","i","should","go","into","detail","about","why","i","hate","thi","movi","but","to","do","so","would","onli","grant","thi","movi","much","respect","than","it","deserv"],"filtered":["catch","thi","movi","tube","sundai","think","bad","look","imdb","see","think","surpris","amount","silli","peopl","enjoi","thi","fluff","howev","surpris","look","comment","read","hate","categori","onli","find","none","shock","thi","alwai","look","hate","alwai","hate","movi","matt","good","somehow","thi","movi","make","unscath","hater","sai","nai","proclaim","proudli","hate","thi","movi","know","go","detail","hate","thi","movi","onli","grant","thi","movi","much","respect","deserv"],"filtered2":["catch","tube","sundai","think","bad","look","imdb","see","think","surpris","amount","silli","peopl","enjoi","fluff","howev","surpris","look","comment","read","hate","categori","onli","find","none","shock","alwai","look","hate","alwai","hate","matt","good","somehow","make","unscath","hater","nai","proclaim","proudli","hate","know","go","detail","hate","onli","grant","respect","deserv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,9,11,12,16,23,26,38,113,145,197,200,280,326,339,370,385,408,423,508,512,549,591,694,740,771,1066,1473,2730,3431,3944,4577,6129,6855,6901],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,6,9,11,12,16,23,26,38,113,145,197,200,280,326,339,370,385,408,423,508,512,549,591,694,740,771,1066,1473,2730,3431,3944,4577,6129,6855,6901],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.982619630677639,2.133457220525776,3.589841616087325,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.519311641348122,2.1521782565202803,2.34599021453259,5.116663665627972,2.5308211829319704,2.8028805344481915,5.885680771176112,15.01922221025713,2.9958122703541616,3.09496984188738,3.130944944345658,3.164467636384302,3.4149707055943286,3.369778711402955,3.4471119148061256,3.509308122676031,3.6284289511740746,3.7165362186843414,3.7398317812878634,4.3095999406873045,4.535724120139652,5.322690055917252,5.649374286172302,5.850044981634453,5.999576715605417,6.437831646536572,6.600350576034347,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.50808460972783E-4,2.505862069158133E-4,2.506480785860337E-4,2.505976903047264E-4,2.506214064035925E-4,2.5058482525906577E-4,2.506627606186687E-4,2.5054754232407145E-4,2.505862598746464E-4,2.508452136206053E-4,2.5283559737960366E-4,2.505866737783479E-4,2.508239951938733E-4,2.508501267267698E-4,2.5073617206405776E-4,2.5059867737275824E-4,2.506848930096251E-4,2.508028661725361E-4,2.5061161470196704E-4,2.5061069844103885E-4,2.508361608610075E-4,2.506358070744794E-4,2.506361863900526E-4,2.5079674661457357E-4,2.5061170510388693E-4,2.508531250049424E-4,2.5067441971279007E-4,2.50585645300128E-4,2.506992501229479E-4,2.507757671478343E-4,2.5063703648367763E-4,2.5077127222240684E-4,2.508943946566083E-4,2.5112726355820144E-4,2.506739865403454E-4,2.5059852538068784E-4,2.50688880301384E-4,2.5062397600113863E-4,2.505478097371297E-4,2.5061153709162826E-4,2.508626926787704E-4,2.5072507870075754E-4,2.507718436869293E-4,2.5056027947365384E-4,2.5061160081579347E-4,2.505984311460742E-4,2.50683256442923E-4,2.5072672523291837E-4,2.5067574137014513E-4,2.5063600882225677E-4,2.5059905085673826E-4,2.511124876152886E-4,2.5066210879661816E-4,2.506115433759327E-4,2.506607664081856E-4,2.505859016833082E-4,0.9801944567830385,2.5062499726867716E-4,2.505994026657311E-4,2.5058575864248515E-4,2.5078623326048414E-4,2.506855613798027E-4,2.505856538910584E-4,2.505601773897301E-4,2.505349807961615E-4,2.5076150407809313E-4,2.505979299011485E-4,2.5071184239933207E-4,2.5078541996925854E-4,2.506716435043774E-4,2.5061187530261997E-4,2.505605058574262E-4,2.506246038642507E-4,2.505603709024345E-4,2.5057351990548176E-4,2.5056051294891304E-4,2.5072316173520954E-4,2.506485384985989E-4,2.505859883584063E-4,2.5061026230912815E-4]}}

{"value":"Although the movie takes place at an \"Ivy League\" college, it was in fact shot entirely in Northern Arizona, mostly at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff in the fall of 1976. I was involved in the theater department there, and most of the extras in the film are then-members of the theater department. <br /><br />There is an absolutely ludicrous scene in this film (if you know your Arizona geography) that shows several cast members riding bikes from the college to a creek.

{"value":"I had a really hard time making it through this move. It was extermly slow and at times wondered when the plot of the movie would actually come to life.<br /><br />This movie seemed to flow to slow and I kept on wondering when it was going to end. I am normally a person who likes a good indie file every once in a while but this did not satisfy what I was looking for.<br /><br />It seemed they tried to make to much out of this movie. At one point it seemed to turn political which I am not a big fan of in movies. If you are looking for a slow moving movie with little to no plot then this is the right movie for you.

{"value":"This is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that Albert Pyun made in 1993 - and it's the bad one. Apparently all his energy went into \"Nemesis\" which was an entertaining non-stop action movie, and had a much more expensive look. \"Knights\" is clunky and cheesy, a bottom-of-the-barrel sci-fi that too often resembles a video game (new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible). The only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is Kathy Long; not a particularly attractive woman, but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine. As for Kris Kristofferson, considering his age at the time (58), I hope his stunt double was well paid.

{"value":"Having seen Versus previously I had high hopes for Alive. The description of the movie on the back of the DVD jacket sounded promising. Alive did not deliver. VERY slow development. Loads of potential with the cast and the cool visuals. The premise was intriguing but the payoff did not offset the build up. Could have done so much more at the end. Most of the movie is just \" sitting around \". To put it plainly, three of us were amped to sit down and watch this movie and by the 50 minute mark we were struggling to make it thru to the end. It really needed more shock elements. If you are looking for Ichi the Killer or Versus type fights then save yourself some $ and loads of disappointment.","finished_norm":["have","see","versu","previous","i","have","high","hope","for","aliv","the","descript","of","the","movi","on","the","back","of","the","dvd","jacket","sound","promis","aliv","do","not","deliv","veri","slow","develop","load","of","potenti","with","the","cast","and","the","cool","visual","the","premis","be","intrigu","but","the","payoff","do","not","offset","the","build","up","can","have","do","so","much","much","at","the","end","much","of","the","movi","be","just","sit","around","to","put","it","plainli","three","of","u","be","amp","to","sit","down","and","watch","thi","movi","and","by","the","minut","mark","we","be","struggl","to","make","it","thru","to","the","end","it","realli","ne","much","shock","elem","if","you","be","look","for","ichi","the","killer","or","versu","typ","fight","then","save","yourself","some","and","load","of","disappoint"],"filtered":["see","versu","previous","high","hope","aliv","descript","movi","back","dvd","jacket","sound","promis","aliv","deliv","veri","slow","develop","load","potenti","cast","cool","visual","premis","intrigu","payoff","offset","build","much","much","end","much","movi","sit","around","put","plainli","three","u","amp","sit","watch","thi","movi","minut","mark","struggl","make","thru","end","realli","ne","much","shock","elem","look","ichi","killer","versu","typ","fight","save","load","disappoint"],"filtered2":["see","versu","previous","high","hope","aliv","descript","back","dvd","jacket","sound","promis","aliv","deliv","veri","slow","develop","load","potenti","cast","cool","visual","premis","intrigu","payoff","offset","build","end","sit","around","put","plainli","three","u","amp","sit","watch","minut","mark","struggl","make","thru","end","realli","ne","shock","elem","look","ichi","killer","versu","typ","fight","save","load","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,13,15,16,24,59,63,92,98,110,112,159,178,181,187,189,211,224,233,244,247,252,320,384,390,477,479,481,484,508,517,547,635,683,717,842,1017,1048,1296,2070,2077,3606,3629,3674,3850,8309],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,13,15,16,24,59,63,92,98,110,112,159,178,181,187,189,211,224,233,244,247,252,320,384,390,477,479,481,484,508,517,547,635,683,717,842,1017,1048,1296,2070,2077,3606,3629,3674,3850,8309],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,1.1317941569733974,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,2.6420723132238515,1.8693254449200722,1.8729627573220065,2.0489535369135887,2.0881990796736947,2.1290479736304078,2.2466628996789315,2.300267965194495,2.532833256045391,2.4442286541160034,2.4732161909892554,2.498193474075453,2.5687161421197025,2.689504733779216,2.8377834061292515,5.269016116063534,2.7303758068497004,3.0433232530252132,2.938298364153555,3.109204957709252,3.132778125427319,3.351345009714117,3.360519385990158,3.353630724994973,3.291526514503207,3.4149707055943286,3.4198487640477615,3.432149042129413,3.587125145032839,3.6105180246075443,3.7398317812878634,3.8883864756110005,4.0536665665501035,8.321128723053633,8.741937774127193,4.944927550358424,4.944927550358424,5.719991853386255,11.814406790948803,5.7959777603641776,5.7959777603641776,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.275795961125573E-4,2.273779263270829E-4,2.274340676935462E-4,2.2738834617097773E-4,2.2740986578072451E-4,2.27376672633793E-4,2.2744738993572345E-4,2.2734284269338754E-4,2.2737797438108319E-4,2.27612944878843E-4,2.2941898734736641E-4,2.2737834995069852E-4,2.2759369161694316E-4,2.2761740295299345E-4,2.2751400231007035E-4,2.273892418207623E-4,2.2746747251417926E-4,2.2757451948007216E-4,2.2740098094688546E-4,2.2740014954633714E-4,2.2760473054921087E-4,2.2742293271974033E-4,2.274232769046399E-4,2.2756896669080782E-4,2.2740106297614528E-4,2.276201235427731E-4,2.274579692117211E-4,2.2737741672597004E-4,2.2748049992975635E-4,2.2754993025739302E-4,2.2742404826603293E-4,2.275458516337717E-4,2.2765757096628264E-4,2.278688724924201E-4,2.2745757615795557E-4,2.2738910390558245E-4,2.2747109051910838E-4,2.2741219739254277E-4,2.2734308533973034E-4,2.274009105245022E-4,2.276288050973628E-4,2.275039363691942E-4,2.2754637017156231E-4,2.2735440017971131E-4,2.2740096834679308E-4,2.2738901839859744E-4,2.2746598751966345E-4,2.2750543040620826E-4,2.2745916846251952E-4,2.2742311578245487E-4,2.273895807141672E-4,2.2785546503755497E-4,2.274467984827939E-4,2.2740091622677983E-4,2.2744558042094652E-4,2.2737764936397745E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441398E-4,2.273898999400346E-4,2.2737751957101665E-4,2.2755942704103609E-4,2.2746807898261533E-4,2.273774245212432E-4,2.273543075503876E-4,2.2733144456336745E-4,2.275369881754615E-4,2.273885635769487E-4,2.274919259604514E-4,2.2755868907355317E-4,2.2745545012449884E-4,2.274012174117603E-4,2.2735

{"value":"This movie is NOT the same as the 1954 version with Judy Garland and James Mason, and that is a shame because the 1954 version is, in my opinion, much better. I am not denying Barbra Streisand's talent at all. She is a good actress and brilliant singer. I am not acquainted with Kris Kristofferson's other work and therefore I can't pass judgment on it. However, this movie leaves much to be desired. It is paced slowly, it has gratuitous nudity and foul language, and can be very difficult to sit through.<br /><br />However, I am not a big fan of rock music, so it's only natural that I would like the Judy Garland version better. See the 1976 film with Barbra and Kris, and judge for yourself.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","not","the","same","a","the","version","with","judi","garland","and","jame","mason","and","that","be","a","shame","becaus","the","version","be","in","my","opinion","much","well","i","be","not","deni","barbra","streisand","talent","at","all","she","be","a","good","actress","and","brilliant","singer","i","be","not","acquaint","with","kri","kristofferson","other","work","and","therefor","i","ca","not","pass","judgment","on","it","howev","thi","movi","leav","much","to","be","desir","it","be","pace","slowli","it","have","gratuit","nuditi","and","foul","languag","and","can","be","veri","difficult","to","sit","throughbr","br","howev","i","be","not","a","big","fan","of","rock","music","so","it","onli","natur","that","i","would","like","the","judi","garland","version","well","see","the","film","with","barbra","and","kri","and","judg","for","yourself"],"filtered":["thi","movi","version","judi","garland","jame","mason","shame","becaus","version","opinion","much","well","deni","barbra","streisand","talent","good","actress","brilliant","singer","acquaint","kri","kristofferson","work","therefor","ca","pass","judgment","howev","thi","movi","leav","much","desir","pace","slowli","gratuit","nuditi","foul","languag","veri","difficult","sit","throughbr","br","howev","big","fan","rock","music","onli","natur","like","judi","garland","version","well","see","film","barbra","kri","judg"],"filtered2":["version","judi","garland","jame","mason","shame","becaus","version","opinion","well","deni","barbra","streisand","talent","good","actress","brilliant","singer","acquaint","kri","kristofferson","work","therefor","ca","pass","judgment","howev","leav","desir","pace","slowli","gratuit","nuditi","foul","languag","veri","difficult","sit","throughbr","howev","big","fan","rock","music","onli","natur","like","judi","garland","version","well","see","barbra","kri","judg"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,11,15,20,22,48,74,81,82,113,118,140,220,244,276,355,456,487,538,546,574,582,612,620,803,912,1023,1094,1182,1229,1321,1375,1453,2628,2658,3351,3815,3895,4250,5073,5105,5241,5268,5282,5897],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,11,15,20,22,48,74,81,82,113,118,140,220,244,276,355,456,487,538,546,574,582,612,620,803,912,1023,1094,1182,1229,1321,1375,1453,2628,2658,3351,3815,3895,4250,5073,5105,5241,5268,5282,5897],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,2.330690080046114,1.2979240167361772,1.6955116224012472,1.9486336368009016,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,4.3043565130405606,2.354379525480895,2.317169775997098,8.501080262633181,2.634508058031767,2.7884729505849193,3.0316467233633775,3.3001658770939146,3.3220965805878846,3.43462735814388,3.4572130107926293,3.5039747767006686,3.7099788181381825,3.5929222627171646,3.7568101178222815,3.7636829971100436,3.9405024767500145,4.1302590120314875,4.218628162481577,4.327618446189983,4.3095999406873045,4.370968887063596,4.416284083275639,4.74221603786142,5.290429193699031,6.389041482367141,5.695894301807195,12.132536180208179,5.967828017290836,5.9370563586240825,13.737229125258052,6.794506590475304,6.1754673820690815,6.214688095222362,12.875663293073144,13.086384324388797]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.194497759780534E-4,2.1925531043720582E-4,2.193094462670602E-4,2.1926535805328175E-4,2.1928610891855586E-4,2.1925410152956953E-4,2.1932229259911837E-4,2.1922148009526635E-4,2.1925535677457428E-4,2.194819334272077E-4,2.2122345868647695E-4,2.192557189277258E-4,2.1946336794909392E-4,2.1948623224568844E-4,2.193865253813075E-4,2.1926622170779177E-4,2.193416577681338E-4,2.1944488069798167E-4,2.1927754147741047E-4,2.1927673977696283E-4,2.1947401253786448E-4,2.1929870906764093E-4,2.1929904095723207E-4,2.1943952627086723E-4,2.192776205763411E-4,2.1948885564790845E-4,2.193324939519081E-4,2.192548190405606E-4,2.1935421980567496E-4,2.1942116987548006E-4,2.1929978476330163E-4,2.1941723695242683E-4,2.1952496533805862E-4,2.1972871854514207E-4,2.1933211493919229E-4,2.192660887193524E-4,2.1934514652716472E-4,2.192883572382643E-4,2.1922171407356E-4,2.192774735707242E-4,2.1949722707154394E-4,2.1937681902578173E-4,2.1941773696650512E-4,2.1923262471379958E-4,2.1927752932743085E-4,2.1926600626693125E-4,2.193402258220394E-4,2.1937825969134948E-4,2.1933365036190072E-4,2.1929888559081077E-4,2.192665484949162E-4,2.197157900444467E-4,2.193217222746468E-4,2.1927747906929954E-4,2.1932054772559186E-4,2.192550433680464E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630258E-4,2.1926685631708603E-4,2.1925491821167623E-4,2.1943032740576212E-4,2.1934224257171334E-4,2.1925482655736343E-4,2.1923253539347083E-4,2.192104891403556E-4,2.1940869012321282E-4,2.1926556769286473E-4,2.1936523766456556E-4,2.19429615800

Its like they took BTK name and made up the rest. On top of that it looks like someone was like I've only got $20 bucks here take it and make a movie and oh yeah don't worry about researching btk at all just make up something. seriously pure dookie no one should ever see this movie.

{"value":"What a boring film! To sum it all up, its was basically just Nana Patekar beating up his daughter-in-law Karisma Kapoor, while she tried to flee from the village, with her son. Can someone say BORING??? The concept wasn't too bad, but it was poorly executed. The Canadian locales, and some of the village scenes were nicely shot. However, overall the cinematography came up short. The story could have been great, but the movie just seemed to drag on. There is only so much stupidity a person can take, let alone three bloody hours of it.<br /><br />The best part of the whole movie was the song \"Ishq Kamina\", and that was only five minutes long. Other than that, this movie was a piece of crap.","finished_norm":["what","a","bore","film","to","sum","it","all","up","it","be","basic","just","nana","patekar","beat","up","hi","daughterinlaw","karisma","kapoor","while","she","try","to","flee","from","the","villag","with","her","son","can","someon","sai","bore","the","concept","be","not","too","bad","but","it","be","poorli","execut","the","canadian","local","and","some","of","the","villag","scene","be","nice","shoot","howev","overal","the","cinematographi","come","up","short","the","stori","can","have","be","great","but","the","movi","just","seem","to","drag","on","there","be","onli","so","much","stupid","a","person","can","take","let","alon","three","bloodi","hour","of","itbr","br","the","well","part","of","the","whole","movi","be","the","song","ishq","kamina","and","that","be","onli","five","minut","long","other","than","that","thi","movi","be","a","piec","of","crap"],"filtered":["bore","film","sum","basic","nana","patekar","beat","hi","daughterinlaw","karisma","kapoor","try","flee","villag","son","someon","sai","bore","concept","bad","poorli","execut","canadian","local","villag","scene","nice","shoot","howev","overal","cinematographi","come","short","stori","great","movi","seem","drag","onli","much","stupid","person","take","let","alon","three","bloodi","hour","itbr","br","well","part","whole","movi","song","ishq","kamina","onli","five","minut","long","thi","movi","piec","crap"],"filtered2":["bore","sum","basic","nana","patekar","beat","daughterinlaw","karisma","kapoor","try","flee","villag","son","someon","bore","concept","bad","poorli","execut","canadian","local","villag","scene","nice","shoot","howev","overal","cinematographi","come","short","stori","great","seem","drag","onli","stupid","person","take","let","alon","three","bloodi","hour","itbr","well","part","whole","song","ishq","kamina","onli","five","minut","long","piec","crap"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[9,11,17,19,20,31,34,35,36,51,59,61,99,108,111,113,117,124,136,139,153,174,218,224,262,272,286,313,328,398,412,430,434,457,475,504,629,662,678,725,764,1148,1181,1688,1884,2632,3199],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[9,11,17,19,20,31,34,35,36,51,59,61,99,108,111,113,117,124,136,139,153,174,218,224,262,272,286,313,328,398,412,430,434,457,475,504,629,662,678,725,764,1148,1181,1688,1884,2632,3199],"values":[1.0683570856722073,1.982619630677639,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.463169012899134,1.4680183469605717,1.7139899308309823,1.8693254449200722,1.8818517047392527,2.056430207256609,4.277015007255866,2.1183455303375887,2.1521782565202803,2.2797301185117202,2.2323930368088845,2.346825985579986,2.2939035841256437,2.3409902041158843,2.456282578459816,2.5940874818617203,2.689504733779216,2.726701583487816,2.8028805344481915,2.780700890737216,2.907069060519773,3.1550424959247185,3.143848349181566,3.107414446935464,3.1419947805322432,3.4101163271295305,3.3243163373261977,3.3721070011625462,3.3956930001684253,3.488143311483988,3.616452760127359,3.6715125373103863,3.7034641371169887,3.7465885637507435,4.176068548062782,4.274508620876034,9.676888139911947,5.156897801074508,5.822646007446338,5.583416318380505]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4097020749006066E-4,2.4075667160687803E-4,2.4081611628889928E-4,2.407677045465099E-4,2.4079049035382463E-4,2.407553441472228E-4,2.408302224017342E-4,2.4071952367870044E-4,2.4075672248833935E-4,2.4100551847254184E-4,2.4291782711448486E-4,2.4075712015618692E-4,2.409851323632679E-4,2.4101023885640487E-4,2.409007541978265E-4,2.407686528956506E-4,2.4085148662392325E-4,2.409648321523582E-4,2.407810827430797E-4,2.407802024235517E-4,2.4099682081796445E-4,2.408043261416531E-4,2.4080469057813193E-4,2.4095895264117164E-4,2.4078116959887915E-4,2.4101311952363027E-4,2.4084142415433326E-4,2.4075613202122098E-4,2.4086528056278372E-4,2.409387961184069E-4,2.4080550732584615E-4,2.409344775116553E-4,2.4105277032522763E-4,2.4127650467341201E-4,2.4084100797358134E-4,2.4076850686564587E-4,2.4085531750952708E-4,2.407929591559195E-4,2.407197806021706E-4,2.4078100817709667E-4,2.410223118943285E-4,2.4089009598459934E-4,2.4093502655981748E-4,2.4073176119878166E-4,2.407810694016074E-4,2.4076841632749452E-4,2.4084991425345282E-4,2.408916779296218E-4,2.40842693968142E-4,2.4080451997563935E-4,2.4076901172928727E-4,2.4126230833403908E-4,2.4082959614816143E-4,2.4078101421489198E-4,2.4082830641647583E-4,2.4075637834747286E-4,0.9809713522425287,2.4079394036305142E-4,2.4076934973816337E-4,2.4075624091759236E-4,2.4094885168561962E-4,2.408521287765036E-4,2.4075614027516213E-4,2.4073166311921858E-4,2.4070745489132732E-4,2.4092509253415917E-4,2.4076793474448382E-4,2.4087737889248641E-4,2.4094807029668796E-4,2.4083875684592336E-4,2.4078133312136903E-4,2.407

{"value":"Sure, this one isn't really a blockbuster, nor does it target such a position. \"Dieter\" is the first name of a quite popular German musician, who is either loved or hated for his kind of acting and thats exactly what this movie is about. It is based on the autobiography \"Dieter Bohlen\" wrote a few years ago but isn't meant to be accurate on that. The movie is filled with some sexual offensive content (at least for American standard) which is either amusing (not for the other \"actors\" of course) or dumb - it depends on your individual kind of humor or on you being a \"Bohlen\"-Fan or not. Technically speaking there isn't much to criticize.

{"value":"For such a great classic tale, the setting (location), Grendel was disappointing. As a writer, I blame the script which completely lacked dramatic tension. The rubric of the club story is useful and would have provided a new take on the literary classic. For some weird reason that rubric was dropped early on. To know this was shot in 21 days says to me, \"rushed\" and it unfortunately shows. Now we'll have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen. I word on FX, I can tolerate really crappy CGI but the script has to rock and this one was just too slow, spartan and lacking in drama. I'd blame it on the actors but... since I know writing more than acting, I'll pick on my colleague.","finished_norm":["for","such","a","great","classic","tale","the","set","locat","grendel","be","disappoint","a","a","writer","i","blame","the","script","which","complet","lack","dramat","tension","the","rubric","of","the","club","stori","be","us","and","would","have","provid","a","new","take","on","the","literari","classic","for","some","weird","reason","that","rubric","be","drop","earli","on","to","know","thi","be","shoot","in","dai","sai","to","me","rush","and","it","unfortun","show","now","we","will","have","to","wait","for","the","hollywood","version","on","the","big","screen","i","word","on","fx","i","can","toler","realli","crappi","cgi","but","the","script","have","to","rock","and","thi","on","be","just","too","slow","spartan","and","lack","in","drama","i","have","blame","it","on","the","actor","but","sinc","i","know","write","much","than","act","i","will","pick","on","my","colleagu"],"filtered":["great","classic","tale","set","locat","grendel","disappoint","writer","blame","script","complet","lack","dramat","tension","rubric","club","stori","us","provid","new","take","literari","classic","weird","reason","rubric","drop","earli","know","thi","shoot","dai","sai","rush","unfortun","show","wait","hollywood","version","big","screen","word","fx","toler","realli","crappi","cgi","script","rock","thi","slow","spartan","lack","drama","blame","actor","sinc","know","write","much","act","pick","colleagu"],"filtered2":["great","classic","tale","set","locat","grendel","disappoint","writer","blame","script","complet","lack","dramat","tension","rubric","club","stori","us","provid","new","take","literari","classic","weird","reason","rubric","drop","earli","know","shoot","dai","rush","unfortun","show","wait","hollywood","version","big","screen","word","fx","toler","realli","crappi","cgi","script","rock","slow","spartan","lack","drama","blame","actor","sinc","know","write","act","pick","colleagu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[13,17,21,26,28,31,41,51,56,65,77,82,87,95,103,109,117,132,162,183,187,192,220,227,258,266,287,300,331,332,390,446,463,582,625,695,756,775,820,887,898,904,1012,1035,1077,1364,1675,2148,3400,3427,3945],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[13,17,21,26,28,31,41,51,56,65,77,82,87,95,103,109,117,132,162,183,187,192,220,227,258,266,287,300,331,332,390,446,463,582,625,695,756,775,820,887,898,904,1012,1035,1077,1364,1675,2148,3400,3427,3945],"values":[1.1317941569733974,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,2.6649848339420377,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,1.5687599167621034,1.7139899308309823,1.8610609350701788,1.9073850067444174,3.8927804517536475,2.020196584395323,2.115024371522662,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.125691139326857,2.2797301185117202,2.253494045787767,2.3586007221245198,4.977025712729459,2.4732161909892554,2.5318267134339894,2.8336934208777267,2.6005321873043625,2.7061321952397077,2.747702973022204,2.841890188081905,2.932274249550174,2.932274249550174,5.941068926339787,3.132778125427319,3.233054746047873,3.3467891931782563,3.7099788181381825,3.6194333882654965,3.6715125373103863,3.7636829971100436,3.753391311073496,3.900174431363043,3.944626193933877,7.784600749864274,3.9121030022283168,4.297765483040301,4.2860694432771105,4.235066888824737,4.436351646326448,4.654440426979034,5.170884043049248,5.626901430320244,6.600350576034347,5.822646007446338]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247362E-4,2.154078066332399E-4,2.154609924846838E-4,2.1541767793321656E-4,2.1543806466120744E-4,2.1540661893957883E-4,2.154736133886264E-4,2.1537456994793312E-4,2.1540785215747773E-4,2.1563045283100644E-4,2.1734141771275787E-4,2.1540820795554655E-4,2.1561221314088622E-4,2.1563467621359272E-4,2.1553671901055054E-4,2.154185264322715E-4,2.1549263873662996E-4,2.1559405030503596E-4,2.1542964756197317E-4,2.1542885992980747E-4,2.1562267093784906E-4,2.154504437022088E-4,2.154507697677838E-4,2.1558878983769222E-4,2.154297252728716E-4,2.1563725358021157E-4,2.154836357275369E-4,2.1540732385964904E-4,2.1550498033487078E-4,2.1557075556130384E-4,2.1545150052150504E-4,2.155668916533927E-4,2.1567272961560587E-4,2.158729073506163E-4,2.1548326336575627E-4,2.154183957775203E-4,2.1549606627473255E-4,2.154402735272825E-4,2.153747998203633E-4,2.1542958084691706E-4,2.156454781016616E-4,2.1552718298266577E-4,2.1556738289319746E-4,2.1538551900010988E-4,2.1542963562520205E-4,2.154183147719786E-4,2.1549123191840145E-4,2.1552859836735782E-4,2.1548477184478568E-4,2.1545061712774068E-4,2.1541884748491814E-4,2.158602057199361E-4,2.1547305307223887E-4,2.1542958624900306E-4,2.1547189913423298E-4,2.154075442506242E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476604E-4,2.1541914990540824E-4,2.1540742129050466E-4,2.1557975239475932E-4,2.154932132780453E-4,2.154073312445466E-4,2.153

{"value":"I sat through this turkey because I hadn't seen it before, and because the premise sounded like it had potential. It was mildly entertaining until the hurricane sequence. At the height of the storm, the wind is strong enough to blow windows out of the house, yet the trees in the background are perfectly upright and not a leaf is moving! In fact, when the characters move outside the house, bright sunlight is visible illuminating the treetops. At that point, whatever credence the filmmakers had developed evaporated faster than the highly localized rain in their film. Too bad all hurricanes aren't like this one, it would surely help our homeowners insurance rates here in the Sunshine

{"value":"The Lack of content in this movie amazed me the most. First i though that people was going to compare this to Rock On! but i'm really surprised myself to say that this was worst than Rock On! So-so story Horrible cast Ajay Devgan Jamming with Salman Khan and Asin you gotta be kidding me. The music was Okay Khanabadosh was the track of the movie the rest was bad! Vipul Shah hasn't still learn from Singh is King's critically bashed comedy.

{"value":"How did this ever come into existence? I generally love sci F/Bigfoot whatever films etc. . . but I still expect them to be written without quite so much cheese as this.

The idea of the film is actually a good one. There was a lot of potential to make a great little movie here. I just don't understand how something like this ends up like this. Go speak to the film/arts/English interested students in any high school and you'll find people who can write a better script.","finished_norm":["how","do","thi","ever","come","into","exist","i","gener","love","sci","fbigfoot","whatev","film","etc","but","i","still","expect","them","to","be","write","without","quit","so","much","chees","a","thi","the","effect","be","sad","the","line","be","sad","avoid","at","all","cost","i","onli","end","up","rent","it","becaus","it","be","in","the","wrong","case","i","be","look","for","the","sasquatch","film","with","lanc","henrikson","in","it","still","have","not","see","that","on","the","idea","of","the","film","be","actual","a","good","on","there","be","a","lot","of","potenti","to","make","a","great","littl","movi","here","i","just","do","not","understand","how","someth","like","thi","end","up","like","thi","go","speak","to","the","filmartsenglish","interest","student","in","ani","high","school","and","you","will","find","peopl","who","can","write","a","well","script"],"filtered":["thi","ever","come","exist","gener","love","sci","fbigfoot","whatev","film","etc","still","expect","write","without","quit","much","chees","thi","effect","sad","line","sad","avoid","cost","onli","end","rent","becaus","wrong","case","look","sasquatch","film","lanc","henrikson","still","see","idea","film","actual","good","lot","potenti","make","great","littl","movi","understand","someth","like","thi","end","like","thi","go","speak","filmartsenglish","interest","student","ani","high","school","find","peopl","write","well","script"],"filtered2":["ever","come","exist","gener","love","sci","fbigfoot","whatev","etc","still","expect","write","without","quit","chees","effect","sad","line","sad","avoid","cost","onli","end","rent","becaus","wrong","case","look","sasquatch","lanc","henrikson","still","see","idea","actual","good","lot","potenti","make","great","littl","understand","someth","like","end","like","go","speak","filmartsenglish","interest","student","ani","high","school","find","peopl","write","well","script"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,11,14,16,20,22,23,24,25,27,34,38,44,51,52,53,54,60,64,65,72,77,106,107,120,123,125,130,211,212,225,288,296,335,344,429,455,528,547,557,626,661,836,1861,3694,4386,4448],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,6,11,14,16,20,22,23,24,25,27,34,38,44,51,52,53,54,60,64,65,72,77,106,107,120,123,125,130,211,212,225,288,296,335,344,429,455,528,547,557,626,661,836,1861,3694,4386,4448],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.9708269144703846,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,1.1966138720291084,1.165345040023057,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,2.6420723132238515,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.3982850089458962,1.519311641348122,1.604729392502474,1.7139899308309823,1.7122153074726136,1.7003182735607676,1.8113893252729412,1.838176641236591,3.766857155204268,3.8147700134888347,1.9209463754160525,1.9463902258768238,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955,2.2044500422972613,2.2619070973220485,2.2242236634876535,2.2642139034199635,2.5687161421197025,2.5983793339432615,2.641219492619754,2.8015621426949333,2.9504565686333644,2.908534262247101,2.983093497946387,3.2872346624216657,6.557411652148291,3.4198487640477615,3.432149042129413,3.4471119148061256,3.6528204042982337,3.5727776966246974,3.7881170224473255,4.911775343041523,6.489124940924123,6.214688095222362,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247387E-4,2.1540780663324013E-4,2.1546099248468404E-4,2.154176779332168E-4,2.1543806466120766E-4,2.1540661893957908E-4,2.1547361338862664E-4,2.1537456994793336E-4,2.1540785215747797E-4,2.1563045283100665E-4,2.173414177129432E-4,2.154082079555468E-4,2.1561221314088646E-4,2.1563467621359296E-4,2.1553671901055078E-4,2.1541852643227173E-4,2.154926387366302E-4,2.155940503050362E-4,2.1542964756197342E-4,2.154288599298077E-4,2.156226709378493E-4,2.1545044370220904E-4,2.1545076976778405E-4,2.1558878983769247E-4,2.1542972527287184E-4,2.156372535802118E-4,2.1548363572753714E-4,2.1540732385964928E-4,2.1550498033487102E-4,2.1557075556130409E-4,2.1545150052150529E-4,2.1556689165339296E-4,2.156727296156061E-4,2.1587290735061655E-4,2.1548326336575651E-4,2.1541839577752056E-4,2.1549606627473277E-4,2.1544027352728276E-4,2.153747998203635E-4,2.154295808469173E-4,2.1564547810166184E-4,2.1552718298266602E-4,2.155673828931977E-4,2.1538551900011013E-4,2.154296356252023E-4,2.1541831477197884E-4,2.154912319184017E-4,2.1552859836735806E-4,2.1548477184478592E-4,2.1545061712774092E-4,2.154188474849184E-4,2.1586020571993635E-4,2.154730530722391E-4,2.154295862490033E-4,2.1547189913423322E-4,2.1540754425062445E-4,0.982974846556583,2.1544115142476625E-4,2.1541914990540849E-4,2.154074212905049E-4,2.1557975239475956E-4,2.1549321327804554E-4,2.1540733124454683E-4,2.1538543124717923E-4,2.15363

{"value":"\"Show me your boobies!\" is not funny, and certainly not on a channel that shows cartoons if you understand where I'm coming from. I don't want my 6 and 7 years old daughters thinking like that or hearing that. I find it sad that Nick hyped this crap THAT much and then that's what we get, stupid little kids acting like stupid adults. I know it's meant to be humorous but consider we out there that have sweet little innocent girls in K and 1st Grade who can't wait to see this. I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I saw it. My daughters won't be watching it.

{"value":"This movie is a farce! Names are grossly mispronounced and the plot is twisted and gnarled into something unrecognizable by any literature enthusiast. And they have the gall to give Beowulf a ridiculous cannon/crossbow weapon. Beowulf doesn't need a weapon like that! In the poem, he rips off Grendel's arm with his bare hands! And I can't believe that the scriptwriters did such a thing. The way Grendel is portrayed is impressive however. That and the cast are the only positive points of the feature. My English teacher would go insane if she saw this abomination. Unless you are a die-hard fan of the epic poem \"Beowulf,\" avoid this film at all costs.
