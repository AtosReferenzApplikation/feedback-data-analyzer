{"value":"I will admit that I'm only a college student at this present time, an English major at that. At the time I saw this film I was a high school student--I want to say junior year but it may have been senior, hard to remember. My experience with quantum physics goes pretty much to my honors physics course, an interest in quantum mechanics that has led me to read up on the subject in a number of books on the theoretical aspects of the field as well as any article I can find in Discover and the like. I'm not a PhD by any means.<br /><br />That said...<br /><br />This movie is simply terrible. It's designed to appeal to the scientific mind of the average New Age guru who desperately wants to believe in how special everybody is. My mother is such a person and ever since she's seen this movie she's tried to get all her friends to see it and bought a copy of the film. I attempted to point out the various flaws and problems I'd seen with the films logic and science--and they are numerous--and she dismissed my claims because \"oh, so a high school student knows more than all those people with PhDs.\" In this case, apparently so.<br /><br />Leaving behind the fact that earning a PhD doesn't necessarily require that a person be correct or, in fact, intelligent. Leaving behind the fact that my basic understanding of physics is enough to debunk half the film. Leaving that behind, the film makers completely manipulated their interviews with at least one of the participants to make it appear that he supported their beliefs when, in fact, he completely opposed them.<br /><br />I could go on and on but I think intuitor did a really good job of debunking the film so feel free to read that if you care to do so.<br /><br

{"value":"Back in the 1970s, WPIX ran \"The Adventures of Superman\" every weekday afternoon for quite a few years. Every once in a while, we'd get a treat when they would preempt neighboring shows to air \"Superman and the Mole Men.\" I always looked forward to those days. Watching it recently, I was surprised at just how bad it really was.<br /><br />It wasn't bad because of the special effects, or lack thereof. True, George Reeves' Superman costume was pretty bad, the edges of the foam padding used to make him look more imposing being plainly visible. And true, the Mole Men's costumes were even worse. What was supposed to be a furry covering wouldn't have fooled a ten year-old, since the zippers, sleeve hems and badly pilling fabric badly tailored into baggy costumes were all painfully obvious. But these were forgivable shortcomings.<br /><br />No, what made it bad were the contrived plot devices. Time and again, Superman failed to do anything to keep the situation from deteriorating. A lynch mob is searching for the creatures? Rather than round up the hysterical crowd or search for the creatures himself, he stands around explaining the dangers of the situation to Lois and the PR man. The creatures are cornered? Again, he stands around watching and talking but doesn't save them until they're shot. Luke Benson, the town's rabble-rouser, shoots at him? Attempted murder to any reasonable person, but Superman releases the man over and over to cause more problems. Superman had quite a few opportunities to nip the problem in the bud, but never once took advantage of them.<br /><br />That said, both George Reeves and Phyllis Coates played their characters well, seemingly instantly comfortable in the roles. If only they had been given a better script to work

{"value":"When this was released, I thought this was one of the most profane films ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films worse, language-wise, than this....but this is a pretty brutal assault on one's ears. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but this got ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard a half-dozen usage's of the Lord's name in vain plus an untold number of f-words. I wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, some of the feature actors included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have improved his image, at least playing the Godly \"Stonewall\" Jackson in \"Gods and Generals.\" Lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the worst trashy person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.<br /><br />Depressing, gloomy, semi-pornographic, repulsive: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some Liberal critics - in describing this story, which is painted even worse in the novel. Of course, some of the better-known critics, all extreme Libs, praised the movie. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were disgusted, as well almost all of the paying public. It's unbelievable that anyone could praise filth and garbage like this.<br /><br />Trust me on this: there are no good, likable characters in this entire movie. This is a mean, sick film: one of the worst of the \"modern era.\" That is, unless you enjoy seeing child abuse, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, on and on - two straight hours of nothing but atrocities and just plain evil people.

{"value":"A friend of mine gave me this movie. A friend of mine is now in a hospital were a team of doctors are trying to surgically remove a DVD casing from his ***. <br /><br />I got quit excited by the prospects of an other Michael Chabon movie. After all his novels have brought me much entertainment and previous screenplay adaptations were great, but boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />First off the people that did the casting must have been asleep whilst doing so. I imagine the castings went something like this. \"Tell me, do you like fish?\" \"Yes I enjoy fish very much.\" \"Wonder full, you're hired. Have some money.\" <br /><br />Than there is the script. I have read Chabon, who I hope went blind before he could see this piece of dong, and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel. I'm not quit sure why it annoyed me like it did, but it might have something to do with the fact that listening to a speech impaired 90 year old drunk duck hunter with a right cranial lobe dysfunction would have been a treat in comparison to the one-liners these 2nd degree model massacre kids spat out.<br /><br />This is an actual line from the movie; \"If you tell me something that you've never said out loud to anyone before, than this moment becomes unique!\" Unique? Does it? Does it really? Off course not you plank. Please pass me the Imodium. I'll have a whole ****ing strip. <br /><br />The directing is... well. I've got nothing. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber just got word his grandmother exploded or something. Stick to directing comedies. No stick to directing commercials. <br /><br />This movie is so horrible it left me banging my head against a wall so hard it brought me back to the stone age. I give it 2 stars because I don't wanna be the guy that watched a 1 star

{"value":"I sat down to watch a documentary about Puerto Rico, and I ended up watching one about Nuyoricans. When I go to Puerto Rico, I fail to see the 50% that live in poverty. When I do see struggling people, they are usually Haitians, Dominicans, or Cubans that have recently arrived to the island. There is no such thing as spanglish... either you speak Spanish, or you don't.... and from what I heard... you don't. Pedro Albizo Campos IS NOT MLK to me. MLK was a great man. Campos is a great man to those that want independence which is 1%. To the rest he as loco as Osama Bin Laden. Puertoricans that want independence are a bunch of fools. If you want any proof to all of you dreamers of an independent Puerto Rico see Cuba, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Bahamas, all of South and Central America, and Mexico. Its worked wonders for them. This documentary is not about Puerto Rico, this documentary was about the Nuyoricans and their struggles.<br /><br />To the person that complaint that not enough of Africa was on the show... it was suppose to be about Puerto Rico... not Africa. Denzel will make one shortly just for you.<br /><br />In conclusion... to all those ignorant white people that think we need green cards to come to the US, and want to learn how the prime minister runs things, this is not a good documentary about Puertorican culture. Tell your kids to pay attention in Geography, and History class.<br /><br />***Update***<br /><br />Bocabonita... \"doc.\" was about Nuyoricans. She promoted it as if its how we all feel.

{"value":"Having been pleasantly surprised by Sandra Bullock's performance in Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a shot. While decent in plucky, self-effacing roles, Ms. Bullock's performance in \"serious\" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed 2, 28 Days) leave much to be desired. Her character is at the same time omniscient, confused, and sexually maladjusted (the sub-plot of Sandra's past comes across as needless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character). The two teenage boys gave decent performances, although their forensics expertise and catch-me-if-can attitude is belied by stupid errors that scream \"We did it!\" Chris Penn as the all-too-obvious suspect is wasted here, as is Ben Chaplin's token partner/love interest character.<br /><br />***Spoilers Ahead*** Mediocre acting aside, the biggest flaws can be traced to a TV-of-the-week plot that never has you totally buying into the murder motives in the first place, and as mentioned, the stupid errors (vomiting up a rare food on the murder scene, an all too convenient and framing of the school janitor, the two boys hanging out together in public, a convenient love interest to cause friction, etc. etc) cause the view to go from being intrigues to being bored and disappointed by the murderers. The ending was strictly \"By the Numbers\" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the movie. Using the now-cliched tactic of almost showing the climactic scene at the beginning of the film, and then filling the audience in how we arrived at that moment, the final scenes surprise no one and lacked any of the so-called intelligence the film purported to arrive at it's conclusion.

{"value":"Actually, this flick, made in 1999, has pretty good production values. The actors are attractive, and reasonably talented. There aren't a bunch of clowns running around blasting away, expending hundreds of rounds, but never hitting flesh. Nor are there wild car chases/crashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashed.<br /><br />The interiors look respectably modern, architecturally, and the equipment looks up to snuff. Well, there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a '50s electronics lab. And the pancake make-up on the corpses cracked me up. Not pancake make-up in the conventional sense, but what looks like dried pancake batter slathered over their exposed skin. This is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer).<br /><br />Ah yes, the virus. I would like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst premise for a sci-fi, horror flick I know of, but I can't. A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen? Gimme a break. Warp drives a la \"Star Trek\" are one thing, but photons becoming viruses? This is so silly the desired \"fright factor\" just isn't realizable. The flick could have used one of those awful dream sequences where the dead come alive, or have a cat jump out of the closet, or something, because the viral thingamajig isn't doing it. <br /><br />One presumes Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in this inanity that Lord Oliver gave for some of his later, trashy venues.

{"value":"OK, so I just saw the movie, although it appeared last year... I thought that it was generally a decent movie, except for the storyline, which was stupid and horrible... First of all, we never get to know anything about the creatures, why they appeared, wtf are they doing in our world, and really, have they been on Earth before we were or did they just come from space? Secondly, the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created... Really, how large could the underground for a sub station could have been? There were only so many of those creatures, so I think instead of killing innocent people in vain, they could have just planted some tactical bombs, or maybe clear the are and a Nuke would have done the job. I know it sounds funny and it is, but I do not see the killing of people as being NECESSARY... Thirdly, Leon acts like Superman jumping on the train and fighting Vinnie Jones, who was way taller and bigger in stature. Then again, when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp, watching all the abominations. I mean OK, the conductor had creepy help(lol), but if Leon was so brave he would have gone all the way... I mean he risks his life first, then does nothing exactly when he should have. He could have died as a hero but lives as a coward... this might be the case, but not after showing so much braveness earlier on... Then, the cop thing... come on! This was a city having a subway, I bet there must have been other cops except that lady, other police stations,this was really kind of silly... All in all, great acting by Vinnie Jones, interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all... By the way, what did the signs on the chest mean?

{"value":"I was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, so far what's not to like? It's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a turkey on their hands, and what's the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline, ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious script, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and the lack of rapport between the characters. You have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under-rehearsed. Quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough. Cary Grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery. I have to say however that I was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jayne Mansfield go away with the appearance of Suzy Parker. What's to like about the film? - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a Grace Kelly-like dignity. Generally speaking the film is nice to look at. The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant can't look elegant in his. Back to the credit side, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without an assumed German

{"value":"Jet Li, is one of the best hand to hand combat fighters in the world. He has been for over 20 years and he puts others in the genre to shame. While he is big in Asia, he is almost unknown here in the US.<br /><br />Black Mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him, but it fails horribly. First of all, it is dubbed. While it may have camp value (the dubbing isn't even close and it is flat in tone), it seems inappropriate for the ordinary movie viewer. Secondly, the director in this movie, Daniel Lee, does a horrible job. He cuts scenes so fast, at times, you don't know what's going on. Other times, the camera shakes and wobbles. Fans see Jet Li's movies for the fantastic martial arts. However, the director edits the scenes so fast that you don't even know who's who half the time! Other times, a scene is left hanging (ie Li is beginning to cut a hole in the floor of a jeep, while the badguys arm their guns, two seconds later, both Li and the love interest are already under the car!) Other scenes are so improbable, that they cross over the point of being completely ridiculous (killer CD roms? Just give him Throwing Stars!!!!). Li, needs a director who is less prone to machine gun cutting and more to creating a cinematic mise-a-scene. The added rap/techno music goes from being okay to intrusive. The plot has possibilities but are all squandered by cartoonish characters that take away from any credibility that this movie strives for. And are we really to believe that the love interest would not recognize Simon, because he has a half mask on?

{"value":"I used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters, but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap. If you look at promotional pictures/posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging/kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime. This proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing Police drama to an average type of television soap. When i watch it i feel like I'm watching a police version of Coronation Street or something similar. I have to say i still like the bill as I'm interested in Police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that The Bill used to have. I want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over.<br /><br />As for the script and characters they have both gone downhill, most of the great characters are gone now (although a few still remain i think) and I'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren't, its just that they lack the tough looks, personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble.<br /><br />Overall being one of the only Police programs on television these days, The Bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch, but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness (if thats the right spelling) and would now be classed as a terrible, unreal television soap.<br /><br />Recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved -

{"value":"1st watched 12/26/2008 -(Dir-Eugene Levy): Corny comedy murder mystery with very few laughs. The movie appears to be based on an earlier Italian movie according to the credits but was re-written by two fairly popular American romantic comedy writers. But this one by Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers does not cut it compared to their other efforts. The story is about a couple of down-and-out traveling Americans, played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who stumble upon a lost dog and hope to make a fortune in reward money after seeing an ad in the paper for the dachsund's return. Upon trying to return it, they see a hand sticking out of a garage door at the lady's residence that they believe is attached to the rest of the dead body of the woman who is supposed to give them the money. They freak out and instead of contacting the police and telling them the truth they make out like runaways from the scene expecting to be framed for the murder. The other characters in the film are met on a train prior to this and hang around a Monte Carlo gambling resort doing various things to be pulled into the story. The other cast members include character actors John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton and others. After the police find out about the death, they start questioning the main characters and, of course, they have to work thru their goofy lies to figure out what really happened. None of the character actors mentioned earlier can bring this movie out of it's mediocre state despite some funny moments mostly provided by the Belushi/Shepherd couple. This isn't a horrible movie, it just isn't that good. There are plenty of average movies out there and this is just another one for the pile.

{"value":"OK, so Mr. Agrama's company (which is involved in some dubious business with former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi) produced a horrendous mish-mash by a Mr. Carl Macek.<br /><br />What is this horrendous mish-mash I'm talking about? Well, Macek took three entirely unrelated Japanese sci-fi animated series (namely, Macross, Southern Cross and Mospeada), added TONS of dialogue - believing firmly that the American audience is too dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence - , edited the whole lot heavily for violent content, added some metaphysical mumbo jumbo, dubbed it using some of the worst voice actors this side of acting Hell (Reba West's singing was - and still is - unbearable and a total outrage, especially compared to Mrs. Mari Iijima)... And the result was an 85-episode series with hundreds of continuity problems and plot holes.<br /><br />Of course, the mecha were cool to look at (especially those in the \"Macross Saga\") and the plot parts that remained unscathed were good. But whatever was good about Robotech was not the result of Macek's work or the \"voice talents\" he recruited. It was because of the toils and efforts of the (uncredited - why? would I be too bold to accuse HG of plagiarism here?) Japanese creators. Those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the originals to Robotech now wish we had never been exposed to Robotech. The originals are so much better, naturally, and make a lot more sense.<br /><br />Robotech, however, DID something worthwhile: it prompted legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of Japanese anime creators' intellectual property from such unauthorized and uncalled-for reworkings that talentless people like Carl Macek produce.","finished_norm":["okai","so","mr","agrama","compani","which","be","involv","in","some","dubiou","busi","with","former","italian","pm","silvio","berlusconi","produc","a","horrend","mishmash","by","a","mr","carl","macekbr","br","what","be","thi","horrend","mishmash","i","be","talk","about","good","macek","take","three","entir","unrel","japanes","scifi","anim","seri","name","macross","southern","cross","and","mospeada","add","ton","of","dialogu","believ","firmli","that","the","american","audienc","be","too","dumb","to","understand","the","narr","and","artist","virtu","of","silenc","edit","the","whole","lot","heavili","for","violent","content","add","some","metaphys","mumbo","jumbo","dub","it","us","some","of","the","wrong","voic","actor","thi","side","of","act","hell","reba","west","sing","be","and","still","be","unbear","and","a","total","outrag","especi","compar","to","mr","mari","iijima","and","the","result","be","a","episod","seri","with","hundr","of","continu","problem","and","plot","holesbr","br","of","cours","the","mecha","be","cool","to","look","at","especi","that","in","the","macross","saga","and","the","plot","part","that","remain","unscath","be","good","but","whatev","be","good","about","robotech","be","not","the","result","of","macek","work","or","the","voic","talent","he","recruit","it","be","becaus","of","the","toil","and","effort","of","the","uncredit","why","would","i","be","too","bold","to","accus","hg","of","plagiar","here","japanes","creator","that","of","u","who","eventu","get","wind","of","the","real","deal","and","compar","the","origin","to","robotech","now","wish","we","have","never","be","expos","to","robotech","the","origin","be","so","much","well","natur","and","make","a","lot","much","sensebr","br","robotech","howev","do","someth","worthwhil","it","prompt","legendari","anim","creator","leiji","matsumoto","to","start","a","campaign","for","the","protect","of","japanes","anim","creator","intellectu","properti","from","such","unauthor","and","uncalledfor","rework","that","talentless","peopl","like","carl","macek","produc"],"filtered":["okai","mr","agrama","compani","involv","dubiou","busi","former","italian","pm","silvio","berlusconi","produc","horrend","mishmash","mr","carl","macekbr","br","thi","horrend","mishmash","talk","good","macek","take","three","entir","unrel","japanes","scifi","anim","seri","name","macross","southern","cross","mospeada","add","ton","dialogu","believ","firmli","american","audienc","dumb","understand","narr","artist","virtu","silenc","edit","whole","lot","heavili","violent","content","add","metaphys","mumbo","jumbo","dub","us","wrong","voic","actor","thi","side","act","hell","reba","west","sing","still","unbear","total","outrag","especi","compar","mr","mari","iijima","result","episod","seri","hundr","continu","problem","plot","holesbr","br","cours","mecha","cool","look","especi","macross","saga","plot","part","remain","unscath","good","whatev","good","robotech","result","macek","work","voic","talent","recruit","becaus","toil","effort","uncredit","bold","accus","hg","plagiar","japanes","creator","u","eventu","get","wind","real","deal","compar","origin","robotech","wish","never","expos","robotech","origin","much","well","natur","make","lot","much","sensebr","br","robotech","howev","someth","worthwhil","prompt","legendari","anim","creator","leiji","matsumoto","start","campaign","protect","japanes","anim","creator","intellectu","properti","unauthor","uncalledfor","rework","talentless","peopl","like","carl","macek","produc"],"filtered2":["okai","mr","agrama","compani","involv","dubiou","busi","former","italian","pm","silvio","berlusconi","produc","horrend","mishmash","mr","carl","macekbr","horrend","mishmash","talk","good","macek","take","three","entir","unrel","japanes","scifi","anim","name","macross","southern","cross","mospeada","add","ton","dialogu","believ","firmli","american","audienc","dumb","understand","narr","artist","virtu","silenc","edit","whole","lot","heavili","violent","content","add","metaphys","mumbo","jumbo","dub","us","wrong","voic","actor","side","act","hell","reba","west","sing","still","unbear","total","outrag","especi","compar","mr","mari","iijima","result","hundr","continu","problem","plot","holesbr","cours","mecha","cool","look","especi","macross","saga","plot","part","remain","unscath","good","whatev","good","robotech","result","macek","work","voic","talent","recruit","becaus","toil","effort","uncredit","bold","accus","hg","plagiar","japanes","creator","u","eventu","get","wind","real","deal","compar","origin","robotech","wish","never","expos","robotech","origin","well","natur","make","lot","sensebr","robotech","howev","someth","worthwhil","prompt","legendari","anim","creator","leiji","matsumoto","start","campaign","protect","japanes","anim","creator","intellectu","properti","unauthor","uncalledfor","rework","talentless","peopl","like","carl","macek","produc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,16,20,21,22,23,25,31,

{"value":"It's a good thing The Score came along for Marlon Brando as a farewell performance because I'd hate to think of him going out on Free Money. Not what his fans ought to remember him by.<br /><br />Brando in his last years is looking more like Orson Welles and Free Money is the kind of film Welles would have done looking for financing of his own work. Brando is the warden of a local prison which in America, when it's located in a small rural setting is usually the largest employer in the area. That gives one who is in charge a lot of clout. <br /><br />Unfortunately he has one weakness he indulges, his two twin bimbos otherwise known as daughters. Even when they get simultaneously pregnant by a pair of losers, Charlie Sheen and Thomas Haden Church, their hearts still belong to Daddy.<br /><br />Not to fear because Brando's willing to give them jobs in the prison where they work under conditions not much better than the convicts have. What to do, but commit a robbery of a train which goes through the locality every so often carrying used money to be burned by the Treasury. <br /><br />Although Free Money has some moments of humor, for most of the time it's quite beneath the talents of all those involved. Some of them would include Donald Sutherland as an equally corrupt judge and Mira Sorvino as his stepdaughter, but also straight arrow FBI agent.<br /><br />Of course these people and the rest of the cast got to work with someone who many rate as the greatest American actor of the last century.

{"value":"Yes I know \"talkies\" had just been invented for the cinema 2 years earlier when this was produced in 1929 but this film showed that much had to learnt about the art of producing films.It comes over as a filmed \"hammy\" stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines,rolling their eyes, using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema, which I suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on screen.The gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing as it considerably slows the film.It is now only of interest for Titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film.In next chronological order they could see \"Titanic\" (1953) A Night to Remember (1958)\"Titanic (1997), to see how the cinema's depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years.There have been many documentaries and TV films made including the atrocious \"SOS Titanic\" (1979) On my version which is a DVD, David McCallum gives the introduction.It was he who played Harold Bride Marconi's junior wireless operator in \"A Night to Remember\"(still the best feature film - please read my \"Tribute to Walter\" comments on IMDb under Howard Morley.demon.co.uk)and gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos entitled \"End of a Dream\" so he was well qualified to give the narration.Of more interest I found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the 1912 US Senate hearing which is also on the DVD.Actors speak the actual words spoken by

{"value":"This movie is rated a classic on sentiment not on any quality of movie-making. It moves from the unlikely to the unbelievable, from the unrealistic to the ludicrous.<br /><br />The unbelievable plot revolves around an attempt by two British soldiers and a Hindu gofer to rescue a third soldier who has been captured by insurgent Indians. In the later scene we see a full regiment with drum and bagpipes marching into an ambush. In the British army, a sergeant does not order up a rescue attempt, and if you get past that, he does not attempt it with only one other soldier and an Indian servant when there is a full regiment on hand. The Indian insurgents are so incredibly inept it is laughable...there are hundreds of them but they can't hold their prisoner or kill the two rescuers, of course not. At one point we see the British soldiers throwing blocks of stone down from the battlements at the insurgents, who are scattered around the mountainside in ambush...one would have to have an eggplant for a brain to think this would do any damage. After Cary Grant as the rescued prisoner is shot, he lies on the floor looking around at the water boy...hardly the actions of someone who has been shot in the back. The water boy bravely blows a bugle (which comes from nowhere) to sound the alarm...this he does by standing up high on a wall so he can be seen and shot by the bad guys, and we shed a tear as he keeps trying to sound more notes as he is repeatedly shot and the bugle call breaks up into feeble squawks...instead of blowing the bugle while hiding behind cover as anybody with half a brain would do. This scene has deservedly been parodied in comedy sketches. If they wanted to make a Buster Keaton comedy, they should have hired Keaton and done it better.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","rate","a","classic","on","sentim","not","on","ani","qualiti","of","moviemak","it","move","from","the","unlik","to","the","unbeliev","from","the","unrealist","to","the","ludicrousbr","br","the","unbeliev","plot","revolv","around","a","attempt","by","two","british","soldier","and","a","hindu","gofer","to","rescu","a","soldier","who","have","be","captur","by","insurg","indian","in","the","late","scene","we","see","a","full","regim","with","drum","and","bagpip","march","into","a","ambush","in","the","british","armi","a","sergeant","doe","not","order","up","a","rescu","attempt","and","if","you","get","past","that","he","doe","not","attempt","it","with","onli","on","other","soldier","and","a","indian","servant","when","there","be","a","full","regim","on","hand","the","indian","insurg","be","so","incredibli","inept","it","be","laughablether","be","hundr","of","them","but","thei","ca","not","hold","their","prison","or","kill","the","two","rescuer","of","cours","not","at","on","point","we","see","the","british","soldier","throw","block","of","stone","down","from","the","battlem","at","the","insurg","who","be","scatter","around","the","mountainsid","in","ambushon","would","have","to","have","a","eggplant","for","a","brain","to","think","thi","would","do","ani","damag","after","cari","grant","a","the","rescu","prison","be","shoot","he","lie","on","the","floor","look","around","at","the","water","boyhardli","the","action","of","someon","who","have","be","shoot","in","the","back","the","water","boi","brave","blow","a","bugl","which","come","from","nowher","to","sound","the","alarmthi","he","doe","by","stand","up","high","on","a","wall","so","he","can","be","see","and","shoot","by","the","bad","gui","and","we","shed","a","tear","a","he","keep","try","to","sound","much","note","a","he","be","repeatedli","shoot","and","the","bugl","call","break","up","into","feebl","squawksinstead","of","blow","the","bugl","while","hide","behind","cover","a","anybodi","with","half","a","brain","would","do","thi","scene","have","deservedli","be","parodi","in","comedi","sketch","if","thei","want","to","make","a","buster","keaton","comedi","thei","should","have","hire","keaton","and","do","it","well"],"filtered":["thi","movi","rate","classic","sentim","ani","qualiti","moviemak","move","unlik","unbeliev","unrealist","ludicrousbr","br","unbeliev","plot","revolv","around","attempt","two","british","soldier","hindu","gofer","rescu","soldier","captur","insurg","indian","late","scene","see","full","regim","drum","bagpip","march","ambush","british","armi","sergeant","doe","order","rescu","attempt","get","past","doe","attempt","onli","soldier","indian","servant","full","regim","hand","indian","insurg","incredibli","inept","laughablether","hundr","thei","ca","hold","prison","kill","two","rescuer","cours","point","see","british","soldier","throw","block","stone","battlem","insurg","scatter","around","mountainsid","ambushon","eggplant","brain","think","thi","ani","damag","cari","grant","rescu","prison","shoot","lie","floor","look","around","water","boyhardli","action","someon","shoot","back","water","boi","brave","blow","bugl","come","nowher","sound","alarmthi","doe","stand","high","wall","see","shoot","bad","gui","shed","tear","keep","try","sound","much","note","repeatedli","shoot","bugl","call","break","feebl","squawksinstead","blow","bugl","hide","behind","cover","anybodi","half","brain","thi","scene","deservedli","parodi","comedi","sketch","thei","want","make","buster","keaton","comedi","thei","hire","keaton","well"],"filtered2":["rate","classic","sentim","ani","qualiti","moviemak","move","unlik","unbeliev","unrealist","ludicrousbr","unbeliev","plot","revolv","around","attempt","two","british","soldier","hindu","gofer","rescu","soldier","captur","insurg","indian","late","scene","see","full","regim","drum","bagpip","march","ambush","british","armi","sergeant","doe","order","rescu","attempt","get","past","doe","attempt","onli","soldier","indian","servant","full","regim","hand","indian","insurg","incredibli","inept","laughablether","hundr","ca","hold","prison","kill","two","rescuer","cours","point","see","british","soldier","throw","block","stone","battlem","insurg","scatter","around","mountainsid","ambushon","eggplant","brain","think","ani","damag","cari","grant","rescu","prison","shoot","lie","floor","look","around","water","boyhardli","action","someon","shoot","back","water","boi","brave","blow","bugl","come","nowher","sound","alarmthi","doe","stand","high","wall","see","shoot","bad","gui","shed","tear","keep","try","sound","note","repeatedli","shoot","bugl","call","break","feebl","squawksinstead","blow","bugl","hide","behind","cover","anybodi","half","brain","scene","deservedli","parodi","comedi","sketch","want","make","buster","keaton","comedi","hire","keaton","well"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,9,11,12,16,18,19,20,27,32,34,36,37,47,55,63,66,76,81,98,117,127,129,134,139,142,150,177

{"value":"I was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary on what it was like to be Puerto Rican. When I heard it was Rosie Perez, I wondered..could she possibly know what it is really like to be Puerto Rican. As far as I knew....she was a Nuyorican. Well anyway, I anxiously sat with my popcorn to watch. I realized 10 min into it that my initial apprehension was right. Rosie Perez has little knowledge about what it is like to be Puerto Rican. This \"documentary\" is more a 1st hand, very very personal account on what it is like to be a Nuyorican..and all of what that entails. She (like most of the Nuyoricans I know) have a watered down, partial and sometimes twisted sense of history. (How could they not..they live here.) Yes, all of them are proud. As they should be! But a lot don't know the ins and outs of the REAL culture, history and political background or language for the most part. It all became very very apparent with her participation in the Vieques issue. Regardless of my personal take is on this issue..at least I know what the hell the fight is for. There is she is getting arrested for something she knew little about.. and only participated in because it was a \"Puerto Rican Cause\" I really don't understand how she is not embarrassed to admit to it. For those of you that are not Puerto Rican, please view this as a partial account of a woman's journey of self discovery and acceptance. Do not take this as gospel...a lot of it isn't even true. Please consider the source. Rosie is an actress; not a historian. This movie is not and should never be, for other Nuyoricans, the base for their information.

{"value":"Oh a vaguely once famous actress in a film where she plays a mother to a child . It`s being shown on BBC 1 at half past midnight , I wonder if ... yup it`s a TVM <br /><br />You`ve got to hand it to TVM producers , not content on making one mediocre movie , they usually give us two mediocre movies where two themes are mixed together and NOWHERE TO HIDE is no different . The first theme is a woman in danger theme cross pollinated with a woman suffering from the pain of a divorce theme which means we have a scene of the heroine surviving a murder attempt followed by a scene having her son Sam ask why she divorced ? And being a TVM she answers that the reason is \" That people change \" rather than say something along the lines like \" I`m a right slapper \" or Your daddy cruises mens public toilets for sex \" as does happen in real life divorce cases . And it`s young Sam I feel sorry for , not only are his parents divorced but he`s as thick as two short planks . Actually since he`s so stupid he deserves no sympathy because he`s unaware that a man flushing stuff down a toilet is a drug dealer , unaware that you might die if someone shoots at you , and unaware that I LOVE LUCY is painfully unfunny . If only our own childhoods were so innocent , ah well as Orwell said \" Ignorance is strength \" . Oh hold on Sam is suddenly an expert on marine life ! Is this character development or poor scripting ? I know what one my money`s on . And strange that Sam the boy genuis hasn`t noticed that if the story is set in 1994 then why do people often wear clothes , drive cars and ride trains from the 1950s ? But as it turns out during a plot twist it`s the mother who`s the dummy .

{"value":"I read all the reviews here AFTER watching this piece of cinematic garbage and it took me at least 2 pages to find out that somebody else didn't think that this appallingly unfunny montage WASN'T the acme of humour in the 70s or indeed in any other era! If this isn't the least funny set of sketch *comedy* I've ever seen it'll do till it comes along. Half of the skits had already been done (and infinitely better) by acts such as Monty Python and Woody Allen... If I was to say that a nice piece of animation that lasts about 90 seconds is the highlight of this film it would still not get close to summing up just how mindless and drivel-ridden this waste of 75 minutes is. Seminal comedy? Only in the world where seminal really DOES mean semen. Scatological humour? Only in a world where scat IS actually feces. Precursor jokes? Only if by that we mean that this is a handbook of how NOT to do comedy. Tits and bums and the odd beaver. Nice...if you are a pubescent boy with at least one hand free and haven't found out that Playboy exists. Give it a break because it was the early 70s? No way. There had been sketch comedy going back at least ten years prior. The only way I could even forgive this film even being made is if it was at gunpoint. Retro? Hardly. Sketches about clowns subtly perverting children may be cutting edge in some circles (and it could actually have been funny) but it just comes off as really quite sad. What kept me going throughout the entire 75 minutes? Sheer belief that they may have saved a genuinely funny skit for the end. I gave the film a 1 because there was no lower score...and I can only recommend it to insomniacs or coma patients...or perhaps people suffering from lockjaw...their jaws would finally drop open in disbelief.","finished_norm":["i","read","all","the","review","here","after","watch","thi","piec","of","cinemat","garbag","and","it","take","me","at","littl","page","to","find","out","that","somebodi","els","do","not","think","that","thi","appallingli","unfunni","montag","wasn","t","the","acm","of","humour","in","the","or","ind","in","ani","other","era","if","thi","be","not","the","littl","funni","set","of","sketch","comedi","i","have","ever","see","it","will","do","till","it","come","along","half","of","the","skit","have","alreadi","be","do","and","infinit","well","by","act","such","a","monti","python","and","woodi","allen","if","i","be","to","sai","that","a","nice","piec","of","anim","that","last","about","second","be","the","highlight","of","thi","film","it","would","still","not","get","close","to","sum","up","just","how","mindless","and","drivelridden","thi","wast","of","minut","be","semin","comedi","onli","in","the","world","where","semin","realli","doe","mean","semen","scatolog","humour","onli","in","a","world","where","scat","be","actual","fece","precursor","joke","onli","if","by","that","we","mean","that","thi","be","a","handbook","of","how","not","to","do","comedi","tit","and","bum","and","the","odd","beaver","niceif","you","be","a","pubesc","boi","with","at","littl","on","hand","free","and","have","not","find","out","that","playboi","exist","give","it","a","break","becaus","it","be","the","earli","no","wai","there","have","be","sketch","comedi","go","back","at","littl","ten","year","prior","the","onli","wai","i","can","even","forgiv","thi","film","even","be","make","be","if","it","be","at","gunpoint","retro","hardli","sketch","about","clown","subtli","pervert","child","mai","be","cut","edg","in","some","circl","and","it","can","actual","have","be","funni","but","it","just","come","off","a","realli","quit","sad","what","keep","me","go","throughout","the","entir","minut","sheer","belief","that","thei","mai","have","save","a","genuin","funni","skit","for","the","end","i","give","the","film","a","becaus","there","be","no","low","scoreand","i","can","onli","recommend","it","to","insomniac","or","coma","patientsor","perhap","peopl","suffer","from","lockjawtheir","jaw","would","final","drop","open","in","disbelief"],"filtered":["read","review","watch","thi","piec","cinemat","garbag","take","littl","page","find","somebodi","els","think","thi","appallingli","unfunni","montag","wasn","acm","humour","ind","ani","era","thi","littl","funni","set","sketch","comedi","ever","see","till","come","along","half","skit","alreadi","infinit","well","act","monti","python","woodi","allen","sai","nice","piec","anim","last","second","highlight","thi","film","still","get","close","sum","mindless","drivelridden","thi","wast","minut","semin","comedi","onli","world","semin","realli","doe","mean","semen","scatolog","humour","onli","world","scat","actual","fece","precursor","joke","onli","mean","thi","handbook","comedi","tit","bum","odd","beaver","niceif","pubesc","boi","littl","hand","free","find","playboi","exist","give","break","becaus","earli","wai","sketch","comedi","go","back","littl","ten","year","prior","onli","wai","even","forgiv","thi","film","even","make","gunpoint","retro","hardli","sketch","clown","subtli","pervert","child","mai","cut","edg","circl","actual","funni","come","realli","quit","sad","keep","go","throughout","entir","minut","sheer","belief","thei","mai","save","genuin","funni","skit","end","give","film","becaus","low","scoreand","onli","recommend","insomniac","coma","patientsor","perhap","peopl","suffer","lockjawtheir","jaw","final","drop","open","disbelief"],"filtered2":["read","review","watch","piec","cinemat","garbag","take","littl","page","find","somebodi","els","think","appallingli","unfunni","montag","wasn","acm","humour","ind","ani","era","littl","funni","set","sketch","comedi","ever","see","till","come","along","half","skit","alreadi","infinit","well","act","monti","python","woodi","allen","nice","piec","anim","last","second","highlight","still","get","close","sum","mindless","drivelridden","wast","minut","semin","comedi","onli","world","semin","realli","doe","mean","semen","scatolog","humour","onli","world","scat","actual","fece","precursor","joke","onli","mean","handbook","comedi","tit","bum","odd","beaver","niceif","pubesc","boi","littl","hand","free","find","playboi","exist","give","break","becaus","earli","wai","sketch","comedi","go","back","littl","ten","year","prior","onli","wai","even","forgiv","even","make","gunpoint","retro","hardli","sketch","clown","subtli","pervert","child","mai","cut","edg","circl","actual","funni","come","realli","quit","sad","keep","go","throughout","entir","minut","sheer","belief","mai","save","genuin","funni","skit","end","give","becaus","low","scoreand","onli","recommend","insomniac","coma","patientsor","perhap","peopl","suffer","lockjawtheir","jaw","final","drop","open","disbelief"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,4,5,6,7,11,12,13,14,18,20,21,22,2

{"value":"What's that there in the skies? Is it a plane? Is it Superman?? Errr, no It's a TURTLE!?! See, that's what becomes of the Cold War! Nothing but bad news and other issues! The Americans shoot down a Russian combat plane somewhere over Artic territory and the subsequent explosion defrosts & literally awakens the giant prehistoric turtle-creature named Gammera. He/she is not a very friendly critter as it promptly ensues to destroy everything and everyone on its path. The arguing governments finally decide to kill the ugly bastard with a brand new and super-sophisticated ice-bomb, but Gammera has another surprise in store The damn turtle can fly! The first time this happens results in a tremendously grotesque and hilarious sequence! Gammera lies on his back looking defeated when suddenly fire blows from his armpits and he skyrockets himself up in the air. How can you not love that? Then there's also a dire sub plot about an annoying kid who's able to telepathically communicate with the monster, but that's just not interesting enough. Flying turtle, people!! There's very little else to write about this Japanese (and American re-edited) Sci-Fi effort, apart from that it's an obvious and totally shameless rip-off of such classics like the original Godzilla and The Beast from 20.000 Fathoms. The effects and monster designs are extremely hokey and, unlike the aforementioned films, it never succeeds in creating an apocalyptic ambiance. Respectable actors like Brian Donlevy (\"The Quatermass Experiment\") and Dick O'Neill (\"Wolfen\") seem unaware of what film set they're on and even the original Japanese mayhem-scenes aren't very convincing. Gammera's very own and personalized theme-song is rather cool, though, so it gets one extra point for that.","finished_norm":["what","that","there","in","the","sky","be","it","a","plane","be","it","superman","errr","no","it","a","turtl","see","that","what","becom","of","the","cold","war","noth","but","bad","new","and","other","issu","the","american","shoot","down","a","russian","combat","plane","somewher","over","artic","territori","and","the","subsequ","explos","defrost","liter","awaken","the","giant","prehistor","turtlecreatur","name","gammera","hesh","be","not","a","veri","friendli","critter","a","it","promptli","ensu","to","destroi","everyth","and","everyon","on","it","path","the","argu","govern","final","decid","to","kill","the","ugli","bastard","with","a","brand","new","and","supersophist","icebomb","but","gammera","have","anoth","surpris","in","store","the","damn","turtl","can","fly","the","time","thi","happen","result","in","a","tremend","grotesqu","and","hilari","sequenc","gammera","lie","on","hi","back","look","defeat","when","suddenli","fire","blow","from","hi","armpit","and","he","skyrocket","himself","up","in","the","air","how","can","you","not","love","that","then","there","conjur","a","dire","sub","plot","about","a","annoi","kid","who","abl","to","telepath","commun","with","the","monster","but","that","just","not","interest","enough","fly","turtl","peopl","there","veri","littl","els","to","write","about","thi","japanes","and","american","reedit","scifi","effort","apart","from","that","it","a","obviou","and","total","shameless","ripoff","of","such","classic","like","the","origin","godzilla","and","the","beast","from","fathom","the","effect","and","monster","design","be","extrem","hokei","and","unlik","the","aforement","film","it","never","succ","in","creat","a","apocalypt","ambianc","respect","actor","like","brian","donlevi","the","quatermass","experi","and","dick","o","neill","wolfen","seem","unawar","of","what","film","set","thei","re","on","and","even","the","origin","japanes","mayhemscen","be","not","veri","convinc","gammera","veri","own","and","person","themesong","be","rather","cool","though","so","it","get","on","extra","point","for","that"],"filtered":["sky","plane","superman","errr","turtl","see","becom","cold","war","noth","bad","new","issu","american","shoot","russian","combat","plane","somewher","artic","territori","subsequ","explos","defrost","liter","awaken","giant","prehistor","turtlecreatur","name","gammera","hesh","veri","friendli","critter","promptli","ensu","destroi","everyth","everyon","path","argu","govern","final","decid","kill","ugli","bastard","brand","new","supersophist","icebomb","gammera","anoth","surpris","store","damn","turtl","fly","time","thi","happen","result","tremend","grotesqu","hilari","sequenc","gammera","lie","hi","back","look","defeat","suddenli","fire","blow","hi","armpit","skyrocket","air","love","conjur","dire","sub","plot","annoi","kid","abl","telepath","commun","monster","interest","enough","fly","turtl","peopl","veri","littl","els","write","thi","japanes","american","reedit","scifi","effort","apart","obviou","total","shameless","ripoff","classic","like","origin","godzilla","beast","fathom","effect","monster","design","extrem","hokei","unlik","aforement","film","never","succ","creat","apocalypt","ambianc","respect","actor","like","brian","donlevi","quatermass","experi","dick","o","neill","wolfen","seem","unawar","film","set","thei","re","even","origin","japanes","mayhemscen","veri","convinc","gammera","veri","person","themesong","rather","cool","though","get","extra","point"],"filtered2":["sky","plane","superman","errr","turtl","see","becom","cold","war","noth","bad","new","issu","american","shoot","russian","combat","plane","somewher","artic","territori","subsequ","explos","defrost","liter","awaken","giant","prehistor","turtlecreatur","name","gammera","hesh","veri","friendli","critter","promptli","ensu","destroi","everyth","everyon","path","argu","govern","final","decid","kill","ugli","bastard","brand","new","supersophist","icebomb","gammera","anoth","surpris","store","damn","turtl","fly","time","happen","result","tremend","grotesqu","hilari","sequenc","gammera","lie","back","look","defeat","suddenli","fire","blow","armpit","skyrocket","air","love","conjur","dire","sub","plot","annoi","kid","abl","telepath","commun","monster","interest","enough","fly","turtl","peopl","veri","littl","els","write","japanes","american","reedit","scifi","effort","apart","obviou","total","shameless","ripoff","classic","like","origin","godzilla","beast","fathom","effect","monster","design","extrem","hokei","unlik","aforement","never","succ","creat","apocalypt","ambianc","respect","actor","like","brian","donlevi","quatermass","experi","dick","o","neill","wolfen","seem","unawar","set","re","even","origin","japanes","mayhemscen","veri","convinc","gammera","veri","person","themesong","rather","cool","though","get","extra","point"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,4,5,8,9,14,15,16,23,32,35,39,41,42,49,54,60,63,65,66,68,69,73,76,86,87,93,94,106,109,114,115,117,14

{"value":"First of all, let's get a few things straight here: a) I AM an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact (I used to watch Speed Racer all the time in Preschool). b) I DO like several B-Movies because they're hilarious. c) I like the Godzilla movies- a lot.<br /><br />Moving on, when the movie first comes on, it seems like it's going to be your usual B-movie, down to the crappy FX, but all a sudden- BOOM! the anime comes on! This is when the movie goes WWWAAAAAYYYYY downhill.<br /><br />The animation is VERY bad & cheap, even worse than what I remember from SPEED RACER, for crissakes! In fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie I \"vividly\" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school... & it's the same kids over & over again! The FX are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than Godzilla. In addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices(especially the English dub that I viewed) was horrid & I was begging my dad to take the tape out of the DVD/ VHS player; The only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & Joel/Mike on MST3K (you pick the season). Honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time.<br /><br />Heck, I'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on Halloween for a B-Movie night. Because it's stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, I'm giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement from the 0.5/10 I was originally going to give it.<br /><br />(According to my grading scale: 3/10 means Pretty much both boring & bad. As fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it, then it will become as fun as counting to 15.)","finished_norm":["of","all","let","get","a","few","thing","straight","here","a","i","be","a","anim","fan","alwai","have","be","a","a","matt","of","fact","i","us","to","watch","spe","racer","all","the","time","in","preschool","b","i","do","like","sever","bmovi","becaus","thei","re","hilari","c","i","like","the","godzilla","movi","a","lotbr","br","move","on","when","the","movi","come","on","it","seem","like","it","go","to","be","your","usual","bmovi","down","to","the","crappi","fx","but","all","a","sudden","boom","the","anim","come","on","thi","be","when","the","movi","go","wwwaaaaayyyyi","downhillbr","br","the","anim","be","veri","bad","cheap","even","wrong","than","what","i","rememb","from","spe","racer","for","crissak","in","fact","it","so","cheap","on","of","the","few","scene","from","the","movi","i","vividli","rememb","be","when","a","bunch","of","kid","run","out","of","a","school","it","the","same","kid","over","over","again","the","fx","be","terribl","too","the","dinosaur","look","wrong","than","godzilla","in","addit","the","transit","to","live","action","to","anim","be","unorgan","the","dialogu","voicesespeci","the","english","dub","that","i","view","be","horrid","i","be","beg","my","dad","to","take","the","tape","out","of","the","dvd","vh","player","the","onli","thing","that","keep","me","surviv","be","crack","out","joke","comment","like","the","robot","joelmik","on","mstk","you","pick","the","season","honestli","thi","be","the","onli","wai","to","bare","enjoi","thi","movi","surviv","it","at","the","same","timebr","br","heck","i","be","plan","to","show","thi","to","anoth","fellow","otaku","pal","of","mine","on","halloween","for","a","bmovi","night","becaus","it","stupid","pretti","pain","to","watch","unintention","hilari","at","the","same","time","i","be","give","thi","movi","a","a","improv","from","the","i","be","origin","go","to","give","itbr","br","accord","to","my","grade","scale","mean","pretti","much","both","bore","bad","a","fun","a","count","to","three","unless","you","find","a","wai","to","make","fun","of","it","then","it","will","becom","a","fun","a","count","to"],"filtered":["let","get","thing","straight","anim","fan","alwai","matt","fact","us","watch","spe","racer","time","preschool","b","like","sever","bmovi","becaus","thei","re","hilari","c","like","godzilla","movi","lotbr","br","move","movi","come","seem","like","go","usual","bmovi","crappi","fx","sudden","boom","anim","come","thi","movi","go","wwwaaaaayyyyi","downhillbr","br","anim","veri","bad","cheap","even","wrong","rememb","spe","racer","crissak","fact","cheap","scene","movi","vividli","rememb","bunch","kid","run","school","kid","fx","terribl","dinosaur","look","wrong","godzilla","addit","transit","live","action","anim","unorgan","dialogu","voicesespeci","english","dub","view","horrid","beg","dad","take","tape","dvd","vh","player","onli","thing","keep","surviv","crack","joke","comment","like","robot","joelmik","mstk","pick","season","honestli","thi","onli","wai","bare","enjoi","thi","movi","surviv","timebr","br","heck","plan","show","thi","anoth","fellow","otaku","pal","mine","halloween","bmovi","night","becaus","stupid","pretti","pain","watch","unintention","hilari","time","give","thi","movi","improv","origin","go","give","itbr","br","accord","grade","scale","mean","pretti","much","bore","bad","fun","count","three","unless","find","wai","make","fun","becom","fun","count"],"filtered2":["let","get","thing","straight","anim","fan","alwai","matt","fact","us","watch","spe","racer","time","preschool","b","like","sever","bmovi","becaus","re","hilari","c","like","godzilla","lotbr","move","come","seem","like","go","usual","bmovi","crappi","fx","sudden","boom","anim","come","go","wwwaaaaayyyyi","downhillbr","anim","veri","bad","cheap","even","wrong","rememb","spe","racer","crissak","fact","cheap","scene","vividli","rememb","bunch","kid","run","school","kid","fx","terribl","dinosaur","look","wrong","godzilla","addit","transit","live","action","anim","unorgan","dialogu","voicesespeci","english","dub","view","horrid","beg","dad","take","tape","dvd","vh","player","onli","thing","keep","surviv","crack","joke","comment","like","robot","joelmik","mstk","pick","season","honestli","onli","wai","bare","enjoi","surviv","timebr","heck","plan","show","anoth","fellow","otaku","pal","mine","halloween","bmovi","night","becaus","stupid","pretti","pain","watch","unintention","hilari","time","give","improv","origin","go","give","itbr","accord","grade","scale","mean","pretti","bore","bad","fun","count","three","unless","find","wai","make","fun","becom","fun","count"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,15,16,19,22,25,28,29,30,31,33,34,35,38,56,68,69,73,78,88,97,108,114,115,116,124,129,134,136,137,140,166,197,200,210,214,224,247,248,259,265,275,277,280,290,296,312,316,351,408,419,430,446,458,460,548,581,588,594,632,642,757,817,885,886,938,949,999,1016,1077,1115,1117,1154,1185,1250,1286,1362,1379,1403,1429,1517,1546,1548,1580,17

{"value":"It's somewhat telling that most of the great reviews for the film on IMDb all come from people who have only reviewed one film in their entire IMDb career and yes you've guessed it, that film is \"Parasomnia\". I've often suspected suspiciously good reviews on IMDb for what turns out to be an anything but good films as underhand marketing , but it seems fairly transparent in this case.<br /><br />That's not to say Parasomnia is terrible, but it stops well short of being the good or great film it had the potential to be.<br /><br />On the plus side, it has a great baddie in Patrick Kilpatrick who does a brilliant job projecting menacing and evil, I could easily see him having what it takes to play a truly memorable baddie on a par with Hannibal Lecter. There are some beautiful visuals in the dream sequences, in fact if the film had decided to explore that terrain more it might have been something better. The actual concept of devious misuse of hypnosis is great too.<br /><br />Although I understand suspension of disbelief is necessary for immersion in any good story, it's the mark of a good story that it succeeds in letting you do that. If you find yourself being annoyed at what you find illogical or just plain silly, then the story is losing you and that's what kept happening to me with this film. Other reviewers have mentioned this here and I don't want to get into spoiler territory, but I will say the setup at the ending was particularly ludicrous and disappointing, not too mention the varying mental age of a character that is only supposed to have experienced a few years of life.<br /><br />All in all, there is the germ of a great idea here in diabolically misused hypnotism, but sadly this film fails to realise it into anything

{"value":"After waking up at 3:30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep, I decided that I may as well be entertained while I suffered from sleep deprivation. This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it. What a mistake!<br /><br />Here is the plot (potential spoilers, if you even care) : a neurotic man with an addiction to candy (Josh Kornbluth) works as a temp for some ridiculous company. Suddenly, he is offered the chance to \"go perm,\" which seems to be the favorite catch-phrase of this movie. But with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp, Josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn't want to do it. He hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt. His inability to send several \"very important\" letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious, but is merely stupid. Josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together (obviously a fantasy of Josh's in real life, as such a thing would never happen). A bunch of other stuff happens, but it's too trite and inane to go into now.<br /><br />Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy, I only laughed twice during it; the first time was the opening shot of Josh Kornbluth (my initial reaction was one of stifling fear) and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman (yeah, right). Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying-looking person I have ever seen in my life. He is an unattractive, overweight, balding Jewish man who I am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women. I do not at all sympathize with Josh's character.

{"value":"As seems to be the general gist of these comments, the film has some stunning animation (I watched it on blu-ray) but it really falls short of any real depth.<br /><br />Firstly the characters are all pretty dull. I got a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main antagonist Shunack. However maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking (Laputa being my favourite animé, original Engilsh dub). The characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly, leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected (she loves Agito, who seems oblivious of this). However she promptly seems to forgive Toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more \"happy\". <br /><br />There is also a serious lack of explanation. Like who are the druids really? Are they people? and who are the weird women/girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest? There is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers. The plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this. It is almost like a weird version of The Day of the Triffids.<br /><br />And who does call Toola? why bother with this if it wont be explained?<br /><br />I really wanted to like this film but I found the plot no where near as deep as a film like Ghost in the Shell or having any real character like those of Miyazaki. I do not resent watching it but I do sort of wish I hadn't bought it. My advice? Give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare, but borrow it, or buy it cheap!

{"value":"For a fan series, I must admit that Hidden Frontier is not at all that bad. But, reviewing this series can not be based on whether it is a fan series or not. The initiative in itself is commendable. The creativity as well. I reckon these are people with ordinary jobs, and a big enthusiastic heart for Star Trek. But, doing all this work. Pulling all these resources. Taking all this time, and still all those flaws.<br /><br />First of all the acting, and the lines are awful. For most. The dialogs belongs in a 70's military show, not in Star Trek. The captain (Mr Squinty) looks like he is about to burst into laughter anytime. And most characters are just reading their lines. The directors should be aware of the fact that \"retake\" is not just a word in the dictionary. But I also guess that the series are made in the manner of \"Two Takes Frakes\", who directed many of the TNG episodes and movies Also, I could not help but think that most of the actors are typical Trekkies. Without going any deeper into that assumption.<br /><br />My biggest concern regarding the whole project, is the quality of the releases. When they first decided to spend so much time, and resources on this series - why didn't they make it available in decent quality? Using the quick time format, with low low resolution is a waste of talent. Even the \"higres\" episodes is considered bad quality compared to the standard quality series are released in. Using Xvid codec, with a larger resolution and file size would have improved the experience massively. If band with problems was the issue, setting up a torrent tracker would have solved that.<br /><br />Let's hope the crew decides to brush the series up, and perhaps release it on DVD, giving it the quality the project deserves.","finished_norm":["for","a","fan","seri","i","must","admit","that","hide","frontier","be","not","at","all","that","bad","but","review","thi","seri","can","not","be","base","on","whether","it","be","a","fan","seri","or","not","the","initi","in","itself","be","commend","the","creativ","a","good","i","reckon","thi","be","peopl","with","ordinari","job","and","a","big","enthusiast","heart","for","star","trek","but","do","all","thi","work","pull","all","thi","resourc","take","all","thi","time","and","still","all","that","flawsbr","br","of","all","the","act","and","the","line","be","aw","for","much","the","dialog","belong","in","a","militari","show","not","in","star","trek","the","captain","mr","squinti","look","like","he","be","about","to","burst","into","laughter","anytim","and","much","charact","be","just","read","their","line","the","director","should","be","awar","of","the","fact","that","retak","be","not","just","a","word","in","the","dictionari","but","i","conjur","guess","that","the","seri","be","make","in","the","manner","of","two","take","frake","who","direct","mani","of","the","tng","episod","and","movi","conjur","i","can","not","help","but","think","that","much","of","the","actor","be","typic","trekki","without","go","ani","deep","into","that","assumptionbr","br","my","big","concern","regard","the","whole","project","be","the","qualiti","of","the","releas","when","thei","decid","to","spend","so","much","time","and","resourc","on","thi","seri","why","do","not","thei","make","it","avail","in","decent","qualiti","us","the","quick","time","format","with","low","low","resolut","be","a","wast","of","talent","even","the","higr","episod","be","consid","bad","qualiti","compar","to","the","standard","qualiti","seri","be","releas","in","us","xvid","codec","with","a","larg","resolut","and","file","size","would","have","improv","the","experi","massiv","if","band","with","problem","be","the","issu","set","up","a","torrent","tracker","would","have","solv","thatbr","br","let","hope","the","crow","decid","to","brush","the","seri","up","and","perhap","releas","it","on","dvd","give","it","the","qualiti","the","project","deserv"],"filtered":["fan","seri","must","admit","hide","frontier","bad","review","thi","seri","base","whether","fan","seri","initi","commend","creativ","good","reckon","thi","peopl","ordinari","job","big","enthusiast","heart","star","trek","thi","work","pull","thi","resourc","take","thi","time","still","flawsbr","br","act","line","aw","much","dialog","belong","militari","show","star","trek","captain","mr","squinti","look","like","burst","laughter","anytim","much","charact","read","line","director","awar","fact","retak","word","dictionari","conjur","guess","seri","make","manner","two","take","frake","direct","mani","tng","episod","movi","conjur","help","think","much","actor","typic","trekki","without","go","ani","deep","assumptionbr","br","big","concern","regard","whole","project","qualiti","releas","thei","decid","spend","much","time","resourc","thi","seri","thei","make","avail","decent","qualiti","us","quick","time","format","low","low","resolut","wast","talent","even","higr","episod","consid","bad","qualiti","compar","standard","qualiti","seri","releas","us","xvid","codec","larg","resolut","file","size","improv","experi","massiv","band","problem","issu","set","torrent","tracker","solv","thatbr","br","let","hope","crow","decid","brush","seri","perhap","releas","dvd","give","qualiti","project","deserv"],"filtered2":["fan","must","admit","hide","frontier","bad","review","base","whether","fan","initi","commend","creativ","good","reckon","peopl","ordinari","job","big","enthusiast","heart","star","trek","work","pull","resourc","take","time","still","flawsbr","act","line","aw","dialog","belong","militari","show","star","trek","captain","mr","squinti","look","like","burst","laughter","anytim","charact","read","line","director","awar","fact","retak","word","dictionari","conjur","guess","make","manner","two","take","frake","direct","mani","tng","conjur","help","think","actor","typic","trekki","without","go","ani","deep","assumptionbr","big","concern","regard","whole","project","qualiti","releas","decid","spend","time","resourc","make","avail","decent","qualiti","us","quick","time","format","low","low","resolut","wast","talent","even","higr","consid","bad","qualiti","compar","standard","qualiti","releas","us","xvid","codec","larg","resolut","file","size","improv","experi","massiv","band","problem","issu","set","torrent","tracker","solv","thatbr","let","hope","crow","decid","brush","perhap","releas","dvd","give","qualiti","project","deserv"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,6,8,9,10,12,16,21,23,27,28,30,31,39,41,47,48,50,56,58,64,82,89,97,100,102,107,109,111,124,125,138,140,141,145,167,176,181,185,217,243,247,249,258,276,283,289,309,317,318,319,327,333,334,357,423,432,482,544,564,597,613,614,616,659,691,707,768,806,834,874,927,984,1019,1046,1117,1125,1173,1226,1395,1540,1586,1600,1625,

{"value":"When I was at the movie store the other day, I passed up Blonde and Blonder, but something about it just seemed like it could possibly be a cute movie. Who knows? I mean, I'm sure most people bashed Romy and Michelle before they saw it, Blonde and Blonder might have just been another secret treasure that was passed up. But when I started watching it: Executive Producer Pamela Anderson, wow, I knew I was in for something scary. Not only that, but both of what were considered the pinnacle of hotness: Pam Anderson and Denise Richards, not to offend them, but they were not aging well at all and they're playing roles that I think were more meant for women who are supposed to be in their 20's, not their 40's. The story was just plain bad and obnoxious.<br /><br />Dee and Dawn are your beyond stupid stereotypical blonde's, they really don't have a clue when it comes to what is going on in the world, it's just really sad. But when the girls are somehow mistaken for murder assassins, the cops are on their tale and are actually calling the girls geniuses due to their \"ignorance is bliss\" attitudes. They are set up to make a \"hit\" on a guy, and they think they're just going to \"show him a good time\", but the real assassin is ticked and wants the case and to kill the girls.<br /><br />Denise and Pam just look very awkward on the screen and almost like they read the script the day before. I know that this was supposed to be the stupid comedy, but it was more than stupid, it went onto obnoxious and was just unnecessary. Would I ever recommend this? Not in a million years, the girls are just at this point trying to maintain their status as \"sex kittens\", it's more a sign of desperation and Blonde and Blonder is a huge blonde BOMBshell.<br /><br

{"value":"I can't even believe that this show lasted as long as it did. I guess it's all part of the dumbing down of America. Personally, like David Spade said, I liked this show better when it went by its original title - \"Seinfeld\". What bothers me the most about this show, aside from the obvious, base sense of \"humor\", and general smuttiness, is the pretentious way the episodes are titled. Truly great shows are still funny after many, repeated viewings, like, \"the one where Rob gets accidentally hypnotized\", on the \"Dick Van Dyke Show\", or \"the one where Lucy and Ethel work at the candy factory.\" In other words, it's an honor bestowed upon great programs by the viewers. That the writers and producers of \"Friends\" would have the unmitigated hubris to actually title the episodes, themselves, in such a fashion, before anyone's even had a chance to even see it a second time, speaks to not only the mediocrity and lack of original thinking on the part of said writers, but, also, of the stultified minds of their viewers.<br /><br />You read the comments of some of these people and can only come to the conclusion that they live in a Hallmark Card-like Neverland, full of greeting card sentiment. The true meaning of friendship? I want to be a friend? I want to live in Manhattan? Wake Up. These people are supposed to be working in coffee shops and looking for work as actors, but they somehow manage to live in $4000/mo. apartments? Get real. All I have to say to those amongst us that want to move to Manhattan and live the idyllic New York life with your Rosses and Monicas, good luck with all of that. That New York doesn't exist for anyone making less than a serious six-figure income. But, good luck with all of that, anyway.

{"value":"This movie gets both a 6/10 rating from me, as well as a 9/10. Here is why: As a standard horror movie for the standard horror crowd, where action and gore and scares are taken into consideration, this movie WILL bore you. It's basically a family drama similar to what you'd see on the Lifetime channel, but put in a horror universe. The story and formula are age-old, retreaded hundreds of times. If you're looking for any originality in the plot structure or the minimal conflicts, you'll be disappointed. Take away the zombies and you'll have something just as melodramatic as A Beautiful Mind, tripping on cheese. This is the 6/10.<br /><br />However, the basic synopsis and idea is pretty original and over-the-top. It's literally something you and your friends would joke about when you're half-drunk . . . but that joke actually got a theatrical release. The idea gets a 9/10 from me. The only reason it isn't perfect is because they could have taken it even further, but they didn't.<br /><br />The mix of both is mixed. I thought it was funny, but as with most all comedies, it wasn't THAT funny. I had my mom and little sister watch it with me and the jokes we made about it were funnier than the jokes scripted. There were moments of utter genius, but there were also moments of pure boredom.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that other movies take this kind of over-the-top risk and original ideas. I just can't say it was perfect, or even near it, because of the lack of originality to the plot.<br /><br />A GREAT family movie. A great movie to watch with a bunch of guys (or girls). A great movie to watch with anyone . . . but if you watch it alone, it will be a bit boring.

{"value":"This ranks way up there on my top list of worst movies I've seen so far on Starz on Demand. They seem to pick up every straight to DVD crap-fest they can find and put it on here.<br /><br />Why? Who knows! Apparently anyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on TV. To be honest, this looked terrible from the moment I saw the trailer--but I did give it a real chance.<br /><br />I always try to have an open mind about low-budget movies. Some of the best movies I've ever seen were films that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required that low budget to be great.<br /><br />This is not one of those movies.<br /><br />You know the plot by now, I'm sure, if you're reading this. Either you heard about it on Starz on Demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom. It's about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad \"heavy metal\" music video. Whoever put it together must have thought it looked really interesting, but it really, really doesn't. Anyway, she kills herself. Then she possesses someone. Then some killing starts. It's really unmemorable and as completely average and boring as possible. When the first gunshot goes off in her apartment it quite seriously sounds like a piece of popcorn popping. Was that the best sound effect they could come up with? I could find a better sound effect to use for free, (with no copyright,) on the internet... right. now.<br /><br />Don't let the other reviews claiming this is a 10 star movie fool you.

{"value":"I couldn't give this film a bad rating or bad review for two reasons: Robin Williams and Toni Collete. The film has the potential of being a thriller and there are some slight disturbing elements that lean to the psychological which was something the film could have focused a little on. Robin Williams plays Gabriel Noon, a storytelling night time deejay who is going through personal issues: his lover moves out and Gabriel is having what seems to be a case of storyteller's block. One day he receives and reads a story written by a dying 14-year old boy named Pete Boland (Rory Culkin). Pete tells the story of his life and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents. He lives with his adopted mother and social worker, Donna Boland (Toni Collette). Gabriel is fascinated and begins a friendship with Pete, but things seem strange when Gabriel attempts to meet him and discovers the possibility that Pete Boland may not even exist. I won't go into detail because I don't want to spoil the film, but I will tell you this: it is quite predictable. Fascinating atmosphere for telling a story and good performances from Robin Williams and Toni Collette, who I thought was the film's key character. Collette is without question one of the most talented and loveliest actresses. Her ability to tap into the psyche and personality of the characters she portrays is very uncanny and I hope to see her win an Oscar (hell, I think she might pull off getting a Best Supporting Actress nod for this one if the script were a little better). The film starts off as a psychological thriller, but a predictable one at that. If your curious to know the film's ending and twists, then see the film otherwise I would rent another predictable thriller called \"Hide and

{"value":"Friz Freleng's 'Speedy Gonzalez' was the second cartoon to feature the title character after Robert McKimson's 'Cat-tails for Two'. In that cartoon, Speedy has been an ugly little creature with a big gold tooth but by his second appearance the famous design had already been adopted. Despite looking significantly more handsome, Speedy never developed into much of a character. A big hat, tremendous speed and a bad Mexican accent do not a classic character make and that's pretty much all Speedy ever had going for him. Nevertheless, the cocky little mouse proved enormously popular and went on to star in many shorts including some truly abysmal films from the studio's latter days. While these early Speedy shorts are better than those later atrocities in which he was frequently (rather oddly) paired up with Daffy Duck, they still leave much to be desired, relying on predictable gags usually based around a similar chase formula. In this self-titled episode, Speedy is recruited by some other mice to steal cheese for them from the local factory which happens to be guarded by Sylvester the cat. Although he brings the extra weight of a star turn to the cartoon, Sylvester's role here could just as easily been filled by any other generic cartoon cat. His personality is sapped by his being forced into the predictable. undemanding role of pursuer. This was always a problem in the Tweety cartoons too but Speedy makes an even duller adversary thanks to his detestable cockiness and the blatant impossibility of his capture. Poor old Sylvester would be forced to appear alongside Speedy for many years to come. Despite it following a pretty basic formula and featuring minimal laughs, 'Speedy Gonzalez' won an Oscar and a thoroughly undeserving star was born.","finished_norm":["friz","freleng","speedi","gonzalez","be","the","cartoon","to","featur","the","titl","charact","after","robert","mckimson","cattail","for","two","in","that","cartoon","speedi","have","be","a","ugli","littl","creatur","with","a","big","gold","tooth","but","by","hi","appear","the","famou","design","have","alreadi","be","adopt","despit","look","significantli","much","handsom","speedi","never","develop","into","much","of","a","charact","a","big","hat","tremend","spe","and","a","bad","mexican","accent","do","not","a","classic","charact","make","and","that","pretti","much","all","speedi","ever","have","go","for","him","nevertheless","the","cocki","littl","mous","prove","enorm","popular","and","go","on","to","star","in","mani","short","includ","some","truli","abysm","film","from","the","studio","latter","dai","while","thi","earli","speedi","short","be","well","than","that","late","atroc","in","which","he","be","frequent","rather","oddli","pair","up","with","daffi","duck","thei","still","leav","much","to","be","desir","reli","on","predict","gag","usual","base","around","a","similar","chase","formula","in","thi","selftitl","episod","speedi","be","recruit","by","some","other","mous","to","steal","chees","for","them","from","the","local","factori","which","happen","to","be","guard","by","sylvest","the","cat","although","he","bring","the","extra","weight","of","a","star","turn","to","the","cartoon","sylvest","role","here","can","just","a","easili","be","fill","by","ani","other","gener","cartoon","cat","hi","person","be","sap","by","hi","be","forc","into","the","predict","undemand","role","of","pursuer","thi","be","alwai","a","problem","in","the","tweeti","cartoon","too","but","speedi","make","a","even","dull","adversari","thank","to","hi","detest","cocki","and","the","blatant","imposs","of","hi","captur","poor","old","sylvest","would","be","forc","to","appear","alongsid","speedi","for","mani","year","to","come","despit","it","follow","a","pretti","basic","formula","and","featur","minim","laugh","speedi","gonzalez","win","a","oscar","and","a","thoroughli","undeserv","star","be","bear"],"filtered":["friz","freleng","speedi","gonzalez","cartoon","featur","titl","charact","robert","mckimson","cattail","two","cartoon","speedi","ugli","littl","creatur","big","gold","tooth","hi","appear","famou","design","alreadi","adopt","despit","look","significantli","much","handsom","speedi","never","develop","much","charact","big","hat","tremend","spe","bad","mexican","accent","classic","charact","make","pretti","much","speedi","ever","go","nevertheless","cocki","littl","mous","prove","enorm","popular","go","star","mani","short","includ","truli","abysm","film","studio","latter","dai","thi","earli","speedi","short","well","late","atroc","frequent","rather","oddli","pair","daffi","duck","thei","still","leav","much","desir","reli","predict","gag","usual","base","around","similar","chase","formula","thi","selftitl","episod","speedi","recruit","mous","steal","chees","local","factori","happen","guard","sylvest","cat","although","bring","extra","weight","star","turn","cartoon","sylvest","role","easili","fill","ani","gener","cartoon","cat","hi","person","sap","hi","forc","predict","undemand","role","pursuer","thi","alwai","problem","tweeti","cartoon","speedi","make","even","dull","adversari","thank","hi","detest","cocki","blatant","imposs","hi","captur","poor","old","sylvest","forc","appear","alongsid","speedi","mani","year","come","despit","follow","pretti","basic","formula","featur","minim","laugh","speedi","gonzalez","win","oscar","thoroughli","undeserv","star","bear"],"filtered2":["friz","freleng","speedi","gonzalez","cartoon","featur","titl","charact","robert","mckimson","cattail","two","cartoon","speedi","ugli","littl","creatur","big","gold","tooth","appear","famou","design","alreadi","adopt","despit","look","significantli","handsom","speedi","never","develop","charact","big","hat","tremend","spe","bad","mexican","accent","classic","charact","make","pretti","speedi","ever","go","nevertheless","cocki","littl","mous","prove","enorm","popular","go","star","mani","short","includ","truli","abysm","studio","latter","dai","earli","speedi","short","well","late","atroc","frequent","rather","oddli","pair","daffi","duck","still","leav","desir","reli","predict","gag","usual","base","around","similar","chase","formula","selftitl","speedi","recruit","mous","steal","chees","local","factori","happen","guard","sylvest","cat","although","bring","extra","weight","star","turn","cartoon","sylvest","role","easili","fill","ani","gener","cartoon","cat","person","sap","forc","predict","undemand","role","pursuer","alwai","problem","tweeti","cartoon","speedi","make","even","dull","adversari","thank","detest","cocki","blatant","imposs","captur","poor","old","sylvest","forc","appear","alongsid","speedi","mani","year","come","despit","follow","pretti","basic","formula","featur","minim","laugh","speedi","gonzalez","win","oscar","thoroughli","unde

{"value":"I found this film to be an utter dissapointment. The talent available to the director- notably Stanley Tucci, Chris Walken, Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin (without even mentioning the four main leads)- have been completely wasted on an unfunny, mediocre story, whose conclusion one couldn't really care about once introduced to the dire, stereo-typed characters. Julia Roberts is feeble, Zeta-Jones is just plain annoying (appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity, minus the humour), Crystal just plays his same old hyper-active, neurotic, annoying alter-ego and Cusack simply walks through his part, apparently bored with the whole project.<br /><br />For what is supposed to be a 'Romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, let alone chemistry, and as for the comedy- (possible SPOILERS)well, the only moments of mild humour came off the back of Cusack's role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin- the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever. (Spoilers) Azaria was reasonably amusing as the Mexican lover and Walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse-maverick-Dogme type director- but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead (Spoilers) we were treated to Billy Crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog. Pure genius.<br /><br />For a huge fan of the majority of John Cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, I was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas, and at the
