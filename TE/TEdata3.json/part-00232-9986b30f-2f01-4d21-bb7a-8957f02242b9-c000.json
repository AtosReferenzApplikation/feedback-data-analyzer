{"value":"This movie was probably about as silly as The Naked Gun (which was supposed to be). Case in point:<br /><br />1. In order to fake her drowning Roberts is secretly taking swimming lessons at the YWCA. After her \"death\" the YWCA calls her husband at work to give their condolences. HELLO how did they get his work number?<br /><br />2. Before she leaves town she drops her wedding ring in the toilet. Days or even weeks later her hubby finds it in the John. Does this mean the toilet was never flushed?<br /><br />3. No explanation is given on how she is paying for her mothers care in the retirement home (since she did it behind her RICH husbands back).<br /><br />4. Towards the end of this tiresome film Roberts suspects her husband is in the house. Instead of running for her life she runs to the kitchen instead to see if the cans are stacked neatly.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","probabl","about","a","silli","a","the","nake","gun","which","be","suppos","to","be","case","in","pointbr","br","in","order","to","fake","her","drown","robert","be","secretli","take","swim","lesson","at","the","ywca","after","her","death","the","ywca","call","her","husband","at","work","to","give","their","condol","hello","how","do","thei","get","hi","work","numberbr","br","befor","she","leav","town","she","drop","her","wed","ring","in","the","toilet","dai","or","even","week","late","her","hubbi","find","it","in","the","john","doe","thi","mean","the","toilet","be","never","flushedbr","br","no","explan","be","give","on","how","she","be","pai","for","her","mother","care","in","the","retir","home","sinc","she","do","it","behind","her","rich","husband","backbr","br","toward","the","end","of","thi","tiresom","film","robert","suspect","her","husband","be","in","the","hous","instead","of","run","for","her","life","she","run","to","the","kitchen","instead","to","see","if","the","can","be","stack","neatli"],"filtered":["thi","movi","probabl","silli","nake","gun","suppos","case","pointbr","br","order","fake","drown","robert","secretli","take","swim","lesson","ywca","death","ywca","call","husband","work","give","condol","hello","thei","get","hi","work","numberbr","br","befor","leav","town","drop","wed","ring","toilet","dai","even","week","late","hubbi","find","john","doe","thi","mean","toilet","never","flushedbr","br","explan","give","pai","mother","care","retir","home","sinc","behind","rich","husband","backbr","br","toward","end","thi","tiresom","film","robert","suspect","husband","hous","instead","run","life","run","kitchen","instead","see","stack","neatli"],"filtered2":["probabl","silli","nake","gun","suppos","case","pointbr","order","fake","drown","robert","secretli","take","swim","lesson","ywca","death","ywca","call","husband","work","give","condol","hello","get","work","numberbr","befor","leav","town","drop","wed","ring","toilet","dai","even","week","late","hubbi","find","john","doe","mean","toilet","never","flushedbr","explan","give","pai","mother","care","retir","home","sinc","behind","rich","husband","backbr","toward","end","tiresom","robert","suspect","husband","hous","instead","run","life","run","kitchen","instead","see","stack","neatli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,18,24,30,31,38,42,48,74,75,79,88,132,137,142,148,149,150,152,162,205,213,245,288,291,302,322,385,393,397,439,450,501,536,539,563,639,857,893,904,937,977,1000,1084,1272,1497,1891,2357,2388,2706,2717,2773,2866,3822,4295,4426,5461,6048,7267],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,18,24,30,31,38,42,48,74,75,79,88,132,137,142,148,149,150,152,162,205,213,245,288,291,302,322,385,393,397,439,450,501,536,539,563,639,857,893,904,937,977,1000,1084,1272,1497,1891,2357,2388,2706,2717,2773,2866,3822,4295,4426,5461,6048,7267],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.2153159934048174,1.3210361566119257,2.6728839783437044,1.4070669811451506,1.519311641348122,1.6219954307453837,3.3910232448024944,1.9486336368009016,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,2.0317223413467334,2.253494045787767,4.587807168251287,2.2844323215331563,2.3018654096236517,2.3253197803590226,2.332712011146513,4.6262390953961505,2.3586007221245198,2.571852579609833,2.8432628718938773,2.7502029743242886,2.8015621426949333,3.016831637578237,2.902686292364678,2.885344817328191,3.09496984188738,3.120015873813468,3.3176717946075294,3.2872346624216657,3.469984576472117,3.5119855004467477,10.876264290330358,7.221036049215089,3.459754308221302,3.616452760127359,3.9612932464190886,4.017463517886143,3.9121030022283168,4.030886538218284,4.035401218572811,4.062925891962901,4.224077767249142,4.416284083275639,4.770124825978496,9.738431457245454,5.143104478942172,5.089758498236879,5.501738287366237,5.274680836730892,5.3560264761848435,5.444579873526289,5.719991853386255,5.907203395474402,5.967828017290836,6.489124940924123,6.489124940924123,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.4070146255644364E-5,5.3705538618874255E-5,5.4123047970765554E-5,5.3810324422998335E-5,5.381120604458034E-5,5.3735988732063684E-5,5.389580709166163E-5,5.3713271865512875E-5,5.383403888147654E-5,5.9725927454605555E-5,0.5997656045779347,5.362656680225359E-5,5.4627480078360086E-5,5.540675308530341E-5,5.366567073533882E-5,5.351736197598305E-5,0.12643087048113327,5.39008567219635E-5,5.3733629523957345E-5,5.3778165149156055E-5,5.429850043850216E-5,5.3954258831497114E-5,5.401569394038465E-5,5.407388979225307E-5,5.4488879116115595E-5,5.420391761813175E-5,5.648254734248948E-5,5.364250948886385E-5,5.364394455161687E-5,5.377985118178104E-5,5.492292932865037E-5,5.389

{"value":"Not only did they get the characters all wrong, not only do the voices suck, not only do the writers seriously need to get girlfriends, not only are the drawings really crude, but it seems like it was mainly created for ages 1-6. The only episode I've ever seen of this show that kept me watching, was \"A Mattter Of Family\", because I liked the Robin character. And sometimes I think it's just a general copy of Batman The Animated Series. Example: In BTAS, Bruce is friends with Harvey Dent, yeah? Over a two episode story, he transforms into the unlikely villain, TwoFace. In the \"Show\" Bruce is Friends with that Ethan guy, and over a two episode story, he Transforms into the unlikely villain ClayFace. That was just a small example (That may not even be true), but in short, this is the WORST attempt on a Batman series.

{"value":"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** When I saw a preview for this movie I thought it was going to be atleast a slightly admirable storyline. But as most superstation original movies I was left disapointed. This gullible family ends up driving through this \"deserted\" town to take a brake and find this video camera showing these people doing everything their donig and finds out they all eventually disappear, the family goes through all these mysterious stages and never discovers or displays what the heck is stalking them. Their are more gaps than I can count and they don't explain anything that happens how or what. It ends where the family gets in a car accident and get posest or brainwashed or something( which is never explained). The next thing you know ur hoping they somehow find out how all it happened but it ends leaving you completely confused.","finished_norm":["spoiler","spoiler","when","i","see","a","preview","for","thi","movi","i","think","it","be","go","to","be","atleast","a","slightli","admir","storylin","but","a","much","superst","origin","movi","i","be","leav","disapoint","thi","gullibl","famili","end","up","drive","through","thi","desert","town","to","take","a","brake","and","find","thi","video","camera","show","thi","peopl","do","everyth","their","donig","and","find","out","thei","all","eventu","disappear","the","famili","go","through","all","thi","mysteri","stage","and","never","discov","or","displai","what","the","heck","be","stalk","them","their","be","much","gap","than","i","can","count","and","thei","do","not","explain","anyth","that","happen","how","or","what","it","end","where","the","famili","get","in","a","car","accid","and","get","posest","or","brainwash","or","someth","which","be","never","explain","the","next","thing","you","know","ur","hope","thei","somehow","find","out","how","all","it","happen","but","it","end","leav","you","complet","confus"],"filtered":["spoiler","spoiler","see","preview","thi","movi","think","go","atleast","slightli","admir","storylin","much","superst","origin","movi","leav","disapoint","thi","gullibl","famili","end","drive","thi","desert","town","take","brake","find","thi","video","camera","show","thi","peopl","everyth","donig","find","thei","eventu","disappear","famili","go","thi","mysteri","stage","never","discov","displai","heck","stalk","much","gap","count","thei","explain","anyth","happen","end","famili","get","car","accid","get","posest","brainwash","someth","never","explain","next","thing","know","ur","hope","thei","somehow","find","happen","end","leav","complet","confus"],"filtered2":["spoiler","spoiler","see","preview","think","go","atleast","slightli","admir","storylin","superst","origin","leav","disapoint","gullibl","famili","end","drive","desert","town","take","brake","find","video","camera","show","peopl","everyth","donig","find","eventu","disappear","famili","go","mysteri","stage","never","discov","displai","heck","stalk","gap","count","explain","anyth","happen","end","famili","get","car","accid","get","posest","brainwash","someth","never","explain","next","thing","know","ur","hope","somehow","find","happen","end","leav","complet","confus"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,12,23,24,26,28,29,31,38,42,53,69,74,94,103,104,181,182,193,231,240,284,297,395,403,427,450,461,490,515,549,669,716,782,884,965,1062,1187,1203,1273,1325,1545,1842,1974,3082,4932,6908,7726],"values":[1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,6,12,23,24,26,28,29,31,38,42,53,69,74,94,103,104,181,182,193,231,240,284,297,395,403,427,450,461,490,515,549,669,716,782,884,965,1062,1187,1203,1273,1325,1545,1842,1974,3082,4932,6908,7726],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.5932680941439847,1.9416538289407692,1.066728610262888,1.364847727375781,3.9631084698357775,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,4.557934924044366,3.2439908614907673,1.7003182735607676,2.127032521151058,3.8972672736018033,4.16224563969396,2.098582041218749,2.0728240170322856,2.4442286541160034,8.209589017272236,2.517840471459249,2.7049353070058615,2.7666071276613566,3.110998680163279,2.813490713560207,6.306336162260736,3.189397019426827,3.233054746047873,3.469984576472117,3.358217889001879,6.698129014030783,3.3956930001684253,3.4471119148061256,3.7099788181381825,3.6746621462132825,3.7810747398219124,3.9323057095458362,3.9868265484242533,4.100845126825194,4.436351646326448,4.3521595551061,4.409683399244287,4.422928625994308,4.566029469634981,4.890269137820559,4.9909126636002465,5.501738287366237,6.1754673820690815,6.600350576034347,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.903500299357123E-5,6.856948382931937E-5,6.910254618171962E-5,6.870327093370757E-5,6.870439655945057E-5,6.860836154282226E-5,6.881241242297167E-5,6.857935738694436E-5,6.873354878249115E-5,7.625612035758263E-5,0.8648779937263694,6.846865518404367E-5,6.974658867964807E-5,7.074153909300166E-5,6.851858181314573E-5,6.832922601599862E-5,7.003361308611909E-5,6.881885962659784E-5,6.860534938269394E-5,6.866221101950878E-5,6.932655818231898E-5,6.888704170204638E-5,6.896548004963118E-5,6.903978261927756E-5,6.956962748190652E-5,6.920579791552517E-5,7.211507818820161E-5,6.848901028744326E-5,6.849084252886132E-5,6.866436369109141E-5,7.012380866684404E-5,6.881487216134481E-5,7.386693583895044E-5,6.900843824195858E-5,6.856355749510947E-5,6.888002351051185E-5,6.84948550971086E-5,6.853533051698343E-5,6.832888272444246E-5,6.834661038902894E-5,6.850045030264586E-5,6.922298490507631E-5,6.887123382908561E-5,6.859893622272314E-5,6.943248522820664E-5,6.862526486930256E-5,7.090534164113834E-5,6.986265792458392E-5,6.836359825807934E-5,

If a movie like this can be made it gives us all hope in making our own movies. even the costume was bad. it looked like my 7 year old cousin could have done a better job on making it. heck i bet he could have written and acted better as well. all i know is that i have to watch the second part just so i can see if it was as bad as the first. its a cool idea about a killer scarecrow but a much better job could have been done. hopefully another killer scarecrow movie comes out, just not like this one.","finished_norm":["wow","be","all","i","can","sai","if","your","read","thi","be","either","watch","it","or","be","think","about","it","trust","me","watch","itbr","br","i","laugh","so","hard","at","so","mani","part","of","thi","movi","the","wrong","act","ever","make","be","veri","funni","i","cant","believ","thei","superimpos","the","school","sign","i","must","have","plai","that","scene","over","and","over","again","just","to","laugh","much","and","much","everi","time","if","a","movi","like","thi","can","be","make","it","give","u","all","hope","in","make","our","own","movi","even","the","costum","be","bad","it","look","like","my","year","old","cousin","can","have","do","a","well","job","on","make","it","heck","i","bet","he","can","have","write","and","act","well","a","good","all","i","know","be","that","i","have","to","watch","the","part","just","so","i","can","see","if","it","be","a","bad","a","the","it","a","cool","idea","about","a","killer","scarecrow","but","a","much","well","job","can","have","be","do","hopefulli","anoth","killer","scarecrow","movi","come","out","just","not","like","thi","on"],"filtered":["wow","sai","read","thi","either","watch","think","trust","watch","itbr","br","laugh","hard","mani","part","thi","movi","wrong","act","ever","make","veri","funni","cant","believ","thei","superimpos","school","sign","must","plai","scene","laugh","much","much","everi","time","movi","like","thi","make","give","u","hope","make","movi","even","costum","bad","look","like","year","old","cousin","well","job","make","heck","bet","write","act","well","good","know","watch","part","see","bad","cool","idea","killer","scarecrow","much","well","job","hopefulli","anoth","killer","scarecrow","movi","come","like","thi"],"filtered2":["wow","read","either","watch","think","trust","watch","itbr","laugh","hard","mani","part","wrong","act","ever","make","veri","funni","cant","believ","superimpos","school","sign","must","plai","scene","laugh","everi","time","like","make","give","u","hope","make","even","costum","bad","look","like","year","old","cousin","well","job","make","heck","bet","write","act","well","good","know","watch","part","see","bad","cool","idea","killer","scarecrow","well","job","hopefulli","anoth","killer","scarecrow","come","like"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,8,9,12,15,16,19,20,21,25,26,30,34,40,44,50,57,61,62,65,67,73,85,91,112,123,133,141,145,171,181,207,252,289,296,431,481,776,876,1003,1290,1451,1454,1545,1713,1840,2403,6856],"values":[4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,3,5,7,8,9,12,15,16,19,20,21,25,26,30,34,40,44,50,57,61,62,65,67,73,85,91,112,123,133,141,145,171,181,207,252,289,296,431,481,776,876,1003,1290,1451,1454,1545,1713,1840,2403,6856],"values":[2.479906862482093,1.9381148836729736,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,2.8828493162168796,0.9418936859054116,2.1367141713444147,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,3.4960351200691706,2.324031090670098,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.3982850089458962,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,1.717994385570355,1.834162586674748,3.7637034094785053,2.0226120445069267,1.9073850067444174,1.9570915389266579,1.8950689206770979,2.011190219103739,2.0105926690411424,2.2466628996789315,2.2619070973220485,4.642472950759303,2.2657547357741192,2.34599021453259,2.373087554090762,2.4442286541160034,2.5531798379045583,6.0866465060504265,5.656531998284723,2.9504565686333644,3.1419947805322432,3.353630724994973,3.770603439954617,3.8844878351953436,4.035401218572811,4.3336974922663645,4.499089986959872,4.637773374493822,4.566029469634981,11.999153431210834,4.760735085628657,5.143104478942172,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.105662344808562E-5,8.051003968668353E-5,8.113592847496796E-5,8.066712421586961E-5,8.066844585587884E-5,8.0555687489208E-5,8.079527139069724E-5,8.052163260633006E-5,8.070267459004569E-5,8.953521207223056E-5,0.8073640163050726,8.039165293824443E-5,8.189212327435129E-5,8.306033240750985E-5,8.045027369292933E-5,8.02279438474668E-5,8.22291295498185E-5,8.080284129775827E-5,8.055215079740386E-5,8.061891420848637E-5,8.139894948739734E-5,8.088289646652615E-5,8.097499391460859E-5,8.106223538846805E-5,8.168434639960275E-5,8.125716026383624E-5,8.467305691541224E-5,8.041555263955481E-5,8.04177039439113E-5,8.062144174208982E-5,0.07166927835566193,8.079815946310178E-5,8.672997963249561E-5,8.102543276256254E-5,8.05030813522206E-5,8.087465614083871E-5,8.042241525294837E-5,8.046993898330881E-5,8.022754077579021E-5,8.024835550122933E-5,8.042898479663901E-5,8.127734016214643E-5,8.086433584147315E-5,8.054462086229378E-5,8.152332246196335E-5,8.057553432791477E-5,8.325265921113712E-5,8.202840459067925E-5,8.02683

{"value":"The only reason I rented this was because of the article in Fangoria Magazine. The article made this film look interesting. Well, it isn't. This was a very boring, amateurishly written and directed movie. All the actors in this movie are awful, except Faye Dunaway, who is always a joy to watch. But too much time was focused on Gina Phillips and her ridiculous encounters with ravens and Duilio Marzio. Marzio has such a thick Argentinean accent, you can only understand every couple of words he says. Also on hand is Nicholas Pauls, who plays the ultra-bland love interest to Gina Phillips. The bottom line: this movie is not scary. There is only one good scene and that is the last five to ten minutes of the movie. I would have given this one star, but I gave it three just because I like Faye Dunaway so much.

{"value":"Sorry, but every time I see a film wherein a woman sucker-punches a man and the man does nothing but cower, the film looses all credibility. So the new (female) Starbuck immediately tainted the plot before it even got off the ground (no pun intended). Dirk Benedict was so much more plausible as the sensitive hero-type than the new-age Kattee Sackhoff-- whose overacting will probably be henceforth lauded as \"a compelling, exciting, must-see, ground-breaking performance,\" by the politically correct new-speak of today's review copy editors; but in essence, it is just a tired, old image of a woman with a chip on her shoulder as big as a townhouse: the biggest cliché on screens today. I may give this series one more shot, but human caricatures alone will not keep me tuned in.

{"value":"I will keep this as short as possible as this piece of crap barely warrants a mention. ZOMBIE 90 is one of the worst films ever made - right up there with Schnaas' other horrible zombie entry - ZOMBIE DOOM (aka VIOLENT SH!T 3). These films suck so bad that everyone involved in their creation should be shot. I somehow managed (barely...) to sit through ZOMBIE DOOM - but ZOMBIE 90 is so horribly inept - even when compared to Schnaas' other horrible film - that I had to fast-forward through everything after the first 10 minutes. ZERO acting skills, inept gore, horrible camcorder-style camera-work, ridiculous dubbing...it just goes on and on. I really can't find a single thing redeeming about this garbage - and I can usually find SOMETHING redeeming in just about ANY film.

{"value":"I found myself very caught up in this movie, at least at the beginning, and any credit I give to this movie, is Lacey Chabert, she was fantastic!! But thats where it ends. I seem to be very good at figuring out who the killer is, and I like it when a movie is able to completely baffel me, but I felt out and out lied to, they whole time they lead you in one direction and then suddenly they decided to go in a completely different direction at the end, they gave no hit to it at all, thats not misleading that very bad writing and planning, someone did not think at all!<br /><br />I felt the movie would have been much better if they had stuck to the plot that the lead you on, they also seemed to not answer anything, why did Jane(maria) burn down the professor's house.<br /><br />Its a great pity as I felt it started out as a relatively good

{"value":"Not only was he invariably annoying to listen to, but he had NO jokes. I swear, some fobby Asian guy telling yo momma jokes would've been funnier than Leary's crap. (Well, maybe funny for a couple minutes but at least I'll be able to laugh at least once!) Leary claimed he stopped taking drugs during one of his \"jokes\"... apparently he was still high on something; he was just some crackhead imprecating rants mostly drug related. One of his jokes was something like, 'I wouldn't use crack, especially having the same name as between my ass' - Oh man, how did he come up with that one?! I swear the only guy that needs to shut the f**k up is Denis Leary. Thank god I didn't have to see him live.

{"value":"Judy Holliday struck gold in 1950 withe George Cukor's film version of \"Born Yesterday,\" and from that point forward, her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold again.<br /><br />It never happened. In \"It Should Happen to You\" (I can't think of a blander title, by the way), Holliday does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde who's maybe not so dumb after all, but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted. Even Jack Lemmon, in what I believe was his first film role, can't muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy. The audience knows how the movie will end virtually from the beginning, so mostly it just sits around waiting for the film to catch up.<br /><br />Maybe if you're enamored of Holliday you'll enjoy

{"value":"This was a movie about infidelity and revenge. A twin with the \"twin\" connection senses that something is wrong with her sister. This movie took forever to establish the plot. A plot that has been done many times. The acting was lousy for the most part. Once the plot comes together, the movie ends. Laura and Ashley are twins that live with an abusive father. The father seems to favor Ashley, so Laura gets the blame for everything. There is a promise made that the girls would never be apart, but as they grow up, their lives go in different directions. Ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets Barry, a married man. Of course no good can come of this. The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down.

{"value":"Elizabeth Ward Gracen, who will probably only be remembered as one of Bill Clinton's \"bimbo eruptions\" (they have pills for that now!) is probably the weakest element of this show. It really continues the tired formula of the Highlander Series- The hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met, but there is some conflict, and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence.<br /><br />Then you have the character of Nick Wolf. Basically, your typical unshaven 90's hero, with the typical \"Sexual tension\" storyline. (Seriously, why do you Hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex.) This was a joint Canadian/French production, so half the series takes place in Vancouver imitating New York, and the other half is in Paris...

{"value":"I can fondly remember Bo Derek's heyday and the UK press attention (the mucky Sun & News of the World papers especially)- all following her small role in \"10\" with Dudley Moore. Understandably, much fuss was made of her photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed bouncing breasts. <br /><br />Unfortunately, acting is, and never was, her forte! I think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the bargain DVD bins- Orca, Tarzan the Ape-man and Bolero. All these films could be nominated for the \"So Bad They Are Great\".<br /><br />It would be a guilty \"must buy\" of mine! Should you ever read your press, or this comment Ms Derek, please do not be offended- ALways had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to worry about than your acting ability.

{"value":"John Pressman (Micheal 'I shoulda called Ditech' Lerner) works at a doctor's office as an orderly. His mother (Zelda 'Poltergeist' Rubenstein) hypnotizes him to off the people who see thinks wronged him. But this turns out to be a movie within a movie, but the lines soon blur as John goes a movie theater to kill. Prompting a guy who's watching the movie to do the same. Lerner is suitably over the top in this, but Zelda repeats lines of dialog over and over again. That gets annoying fast. But not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie.As a horror film this one fails, it's too busy trying to be clever, trying to impart a message and seems to forget a slasher film must evoke a sense of tension, or at least a jump or two.

{"value":"I saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this film.<br /><br />I am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film, the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathise with any of the roles.<br /><br />For the political buff's and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably quite good, but to the average movie watcher this film is awkward,very boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed

{"value":"This movie is really nothing besides an admittedly well-crafted series of tense sequences punctuated with an inevitable \"gotcha!\" at the end of each. Really, there is no character development and no real plot to speak of. There are only the most skeletal of motivations for the characters to do anything while they trudge forward to their unavoidable dooms. It's all just an excuse to show a creepy ghost kid (who seems to have gotten some of the family cat mixed up in his ectoplasm) and his ghost mom (with long black hair hanging in her face kind of like \"The Ring\") take down a bunch of cardboard cut-out, two-dimensional excuses for human characters.<br /><br />This English-language version of \"The Grudge\" is the equivalent of cinematic junk food;

{"value":"I was expecting a very funny movie. Instead, I got a movie with a few funny jokes, and many that just didn't work. I didn't like the idea of bringing in Sherlock Holmes' and Moriarty's descendants. It was confusing. It would have been more funny if they just had someone new, instead of Moriarty resurrected. Some of the things were funny. Burt Kwouk was very funny, as always. McCloud on the horse was funny. The McGarrett from Hawaii 5-0 was not even McGarrett-like. Connie Booth obviously is very good with accents. She is from Indiana, but played English and a New Yorker pretty well. Unfortunately, she was not presented much into the script. I was expecting a more funny film. Instead, I got a rather confusing movie with a poor script. Rather ironic, since both Booth and Cleese were together on this one. Maybe they were about to break up in

{"value":"I saw this movie twice. I can't believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie. I'm also a movie/theatre director and I know what I speak. This is not Romania anymore, but I see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 September. No story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing profound, nothing hidden. Just empty images.<br /><br />What most of Romanians don't know, this movie is for the french viewers, not for us. They really believe that is the reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I don't really know if we can call this a movie, maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we've got such an image in Europe. This WAS a reality, but isn't anymore.

{"value":"I saw this in a sneak two days before the official opening, and I must say I was extremely disappointed. And I have to put the majority of these problems on the decision to cast Claire Danes in the lead role. Depending on what you think about Danes, she was either horribly miscast, or is so far in over her head that she should be the early favorite for the 2007 Razzie for Worst Actress. I think we were supposed to be sympathetic to her. Instead, she is completely unlikeable. The other \"great\" actresses do an OK job, but certainly don't light up the screen. Out of all the \"great\" actresses in this movie, I'd say the one who did the best job was Natasha Richardson. Streep is barely in the picture, and only appears near the very end.<br /><br />Horrible screenplay as well.

{"value":"Ooof! This one was a stinker. It does not fall 'somewhere in between Star Wars and Thriller', thats for sure. In all actuality, it falls somewhere between the cracks of a Wham! video and Captain EO, only with not as big of a budget, and a lot more close ups of ugly teenagers crying. Simon Le Bon preens front and center, while the rest of the band gamely tries to hide the fact that they stole their whole career from Roxy Music's last 3 albums. Brief clips from Barbarella add nothing. Avoid at all costs. (However, I liked the part when they played 'Hungry Like The Wolf' but why was there a tiger lurking in the audience changing into a woman painted with tiger stripes? I mean, they aren't singing 'Eye of the Tiger' or 'Hungry like the Tiger' it's a Wolf! Whatever.)

{"value":"I saw this movie twice. I can't believe Pintilie made such a fantasy movie. I'm also a movie/theatre director and I know what I speak. This is not Romania anymore, but I see the events are happening in the same period with the incident from 11 September. No story, no plot, nothing. No conclusion, no message, nothing profound, nothing hidden. Just empty images.<br /><br />What most of Romanians don't know, this movie is for the french viewers, not for us. They really believe that is the reality in Romania. Also for teenagers. Pintilie should stop making movies. I don't really know if we can call this a movie, maybe a horror :) And we wonder why we've got such an image in Europe. This WAS a reality, but isn't anymore.

{"value":"I saw this movie on mystery science theater when it was called \"It lives by night\". That title is much less misleading than \"Batpeople\". In fact it would more accurately be called Batperson. This movie is about a doctor who studies bats I am thinking because he wants to make a better cure for rabies. This is not really clear. What is clear is that he and his wife take a tour of a cave and he gets bitten by a bat. Why a scientist needs to take a tour to study bats is beyond me. Shouldn't he be able to go in by himself. Well after being bitten he and his wife go on their honeymoon where he starts having fits. They go to the worst doctor ever. The guy stays in the hospital and kills a nurse. In the end the guy kills 3-4 people and his wife stands by him and you are supposed to be rooting for him instead of the sheriff investigating the

{"value":"Where to start... If this movie had been a dark comedy, I would say it was FANNN-TASTIC! Unfortunately for me, and anyone else with free time and a buck to spare (mind you that was the price I paid, got it from Wal-Mart), this movie was meant to be a thriller. The only THRILL I got was watching Kirkland's lousy rendition of Anne Wilkes from Misery sans snowy woodland area. If you want a good laugh, on a rainy Friday night with some friends, then I highly recommend this movie. But if you want to watch something at least half way decent, then don't even bother.<br /><br />I for one enjoy crappy films, the worse the better in most cases. But Wow... I Meant WOW!! The only person in the entire film that didn't stink it up was the little boy, played by Vincent Berry.

{"value":"The subject matter seems pretty dated today. Adapted for TV from Rona Jaffe's book; we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence. Four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game Mazes and Dragons (based on Dungeons and Dragons). One player, a young Tom Hanks, enters the fantasy world too deep. His co-players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm.<br /><br />David Wallace, Wendy Crewson and Chris Makepeace round out the game's foursome. Support cast is made up of veteran actors like Murray Hamilton, Vera Miles, Anne Francis and Susan Strasberg.<br /><br />At this date, it seems lumbering and tame. But the highlight of watching is seeing Tom Hanks between his \"Bosom Buddies\" salad days and his big splash in SPLASH on the silver screen.

{"value":"I really must watch a good movie soon, because it seems every other entry or so is something that I despise. However my history speaks, I must not tell a lie. Bobby Deerfield and everything about it sucks big green banana peels. I never thought that I would see a film thud as thunderously as this one did. Al Pacino isn't acting in this film: he's posing. There are many, many scenes of his character, who is a race car driver, just staring at the camera. He's perfectly awful. Marthe Keller is just as bad. These two are supposed to be in a love affair, and there is simply no chemistry whatsoever. Sydney Pollack directed this film? There's no trace of the genius behind Tootsie here. Is this the same man I cheered for in Eyes Wide Shut? I can hardly believe it. Save yourself a horrible movie experience.

{"value":"You can't really go far when the initial story isn't all that great. The premise of cyborg's needing blood is just dopey.<br /><br />The script is blasé'. The actors don't have much to work with. The sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs. It's a trademark that if the background is the desert, then the movie has no budget.<br /><br />Lack of budget is okay, if there's a story. \"Solarbabies\" and \"Blood of Champions\" are examples of decent work from no $. but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich. Again, forgivable if only the story didn't just plain suck.<br /><br />Finally, this movie commits the biggest crime of all: It doesn't finish! It simply ends as if it's a commercial break away from the rest of the movie. But the rest never comes.

{"value":"Otherwise it is one of the worst movies I've ever seen - and I mean ever. My wife and I were both bored out of our minds within 10 minutes. Not to mention being boring, it is entirely unbelievable. Women (non-lesbian) don't bathe together - nor do they \"accidentally\" kiss. Brothers and sisters don't live together well into their 30s and run around swing dancing together and engaging in footraces in central park. Men don't find out their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with said wife. Absolutely ridiculous.<br /><br />Heather Graham is possibly the worst actress in films today. She smiles when she should be crying and vice versa.

{"value":"A previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad. What?!?!?! The movie glorifies child molestation. Oh, but Sylvia Kristel was naked in it, so let's give it 5 out of 10 stars. Why not a full 10? Because the filmography was \"agonizing,\" the child's looks of shock were \"unrealistic,\" and the fat friend was \"irritating.\" Nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an American movie in 1981 featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman. I happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had Showtime. To me, even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an Oscar, I would still have to give the movie only 1 star. That TV's Howard Hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in WKRP is particularly ridiculous.

{"value":"I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor. I therefor found it strange that she would appear in a film that so distorted that facts. Her character's rescue from the South Pole was done by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta flying a Canadian designed and built Twin Otter aircraft. The trip had been turned down by the US Airforce, Navy and Coast Guard as beyond their capabilities. The same company staged a similar rescue a few years later to bring out a man from the South Pole base. I feel that the film fairly represented a very gripping subject and documented a very courageous woman facing a frightening task.

{"value":"...but it'll make you wonder if we had any in the first place! This movie is just as bad as any of today's horrible horror. A man goes around ogling semi-clad ladies, trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body. One scene involves a man staggering around and spurting all over the set for a full three minutes, coating everything what what must be well over ten gallons of \"blood.\" The movie also attempts to create a sense that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature, but the movie is so badly done it's impossible for the audience to dredge up any feeling of shock or outrage. Aimlessly dark and unimpressively sinister, this movie can't even get its own title straight-- the beginning credits say \"The Brain That Wouldn't Die,\" but the end credits list it as \"The Head That

{"value":"I saw this film yesterday. I must admit, it weren't my cup of tea. Although it's supposed to be a horror movie of its kind. But as I was watching this, I was thinking.. 'This movie isn't making any sense at all..' Where on earth did this guy in the dark coat came from? Where were the two guys were going when they left the girls behind? Where on earth did a shark came out from?<br /><br />All these elements in this film somehow didn't add up. I felt as if these filmmakers wasted so much time and money on a film that was so bound to be so crap.<br /><br />I've seen many good horror movies in my time, but this is one of the most worst horror flicks I've seen. At the end of the movie, I said to myself that I wouldn't watch it again.. So much pappy show in this film, I've decided to give it the thumbs down!
