{"value":"I don't get this. The movie obviously has a pretty good budget. It has very good cinematography. It has nice pacing, good editing and pretty good directing too. Then WHY OH WHY didn't they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and WHY OH WHY did they hire such lousy actors that can't act their way out of a paper bag? This movie could have been good. At most times it LOOKS good and FEELS good but in the end, you realize that the movie was no good at all.<br /><br />So I would say it's a good production but a bad movie.

{"value":"I was utterly disappointed by this movie. I had read some of the other reviews here and had much higher expectations. I expected a drama with more intense character development. But that never happens in the movie. Daniel-Day Lewis is a good actor, but not as good as some reviewers here would have us believe. I tought he repeated the same set of 4 or 5 movements in the movie. I would rate his performance 6 out of 10.<br /><br />Acting: 6 out of 10 Direction is 5 out of 10.

{"value":"At first, three words: READ THE BOOK! Really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters. I loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film. It was ludicrous, with half a heart and the story bad explained. The novel - in the first place! - wasn't meant to focus on an adventure! That's only the surroundings. In the film, the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat! Additional, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious! They screwed it up! ...

{"value":"I am ashamed to have this movie in my collection. The most redeeming factor to owning the DVD is the short film in the bonus features. My vote for this movie is a big fat ZERO. Don't misunderstand, I'm a horror girl. but i want some meat behind the story, not to mention i prefer the evil to happen to humans, not to be tricked in to watching, what seemed like forever, clips of animal snuff. Acts of brutality interrupt achingly long silence and poor acting. If i was forced to make a comparison to another film, the only one that comes to mind is Cannibal Holocaust. Bad, boring, pointless and a wholly uncomfortable

{"value":"The acting was horrendous as well as the screenplay. It was poorly put together and made you almost want to laugh at the several terribly acted out murder scenes. The ending was even worse. Everyone kept dying, but somehow the ending made it look like everything was perfectly OK! They did not give enough history about the obsession the teacher had, etc. The movie needed more time to perhaps develop a better storyline. The only reason I give this 3/10 is that I kind of feel bad for the young actors. They needed better coaching. They could have really made this an OK film, but the screenplay and acting failed miserably.","finished_norm":["the","act","be","horrend","a","good","a","the","screenplai","it","be","poorli","put","togeth","and","make","you","almost","want","to","laugh","at","the","sever","terribli","act","out","murder","scene","the","end","be","even","wrong","everyon","keep","dye","but","somehow","the","end","make","it","look","like","everyth","be","perfectli","okai","thei","do","not","give","enough","histori","about","the","obsess","the","teacher","have","etc","the","movi","ne","much","time","to","perhap","develop","a","well","storylin","the","onli","reason","i","give","thi","be","that","i","kind","of","feel","bad","for","the","young","actor","thei","ne","well","coach","thei","can","have","realli","make","thi","a","okai","film","but","the","screenplai","and","act","fail","miser"],"filtered":["act","horrend","good","screenplai","poorli","put","togeth","make","almost","want","laugh","sever","terribli","act","murder","scene","end","even","wrong","everyon","keep","dye","somehow","end","make","look","like","everyth","perfectli","okai","thei","give","enough","histori","obsess","teacher","etc","movi","ne","much","time","perhap","develop","well","storylin","onli","reason","give","thi","kind","feel","bad","young","actor","thei","ne","well","coach","thei","realli","make","thi","okai","film","screenplai","act","fail","miser"],"filtered2":["act","horrend","good","screenplai","poorli","put","togeth","make","almost","want","laugh","sever","terribli","act","murder","scene","end","even","wrong","everyon","keep","dye","somehow","end","make","look","like","everyth","perfectli","okai","give","enough","histori","obsess","teacher","etc","ne","time","perhap","develop","well","storylin","onli","reason","give","kind","feel","bad","young","actor","ne","well","coach","realli","make","okai","screenplai","act","fail","miser"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,8,9,11,13,16,19,20,21,24,25,30,37,41,43,93,95,110,122,131,133,134,135,159,191,193,215,246,270,273,316,318,320,398,429,499,515,549,703,1114,1122,1153,1230,1330,1475,1686,2941],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,5,8,9,11,13,16,19,20,21,24,25,30,37,41,43,93,95,110,122,131,133,134,135,159,191,193,215,246,270,273,316,318,320,398,429,499,515,549,703,1114,1122,1153,1230,1330,1475,1686,2941],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.926017105726131,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1317941569733974,1.1966138720291084,1.312380678011735,2.330690080046114,3.4860466360051467,2.6420723132238515,1.2796387880827016,2.6728839783437044,1.4876543214774305,1.5687599167621034,1.6608112036218214,2.035389827120098,2.0323326556775485,4.2580959472608155,2.2489347673732487,2.2512118082053005,2.3212364753796515,2.2443961816702407,2.366244071437088,2.300267965194495,5.092022696851891,2.517840471459249,2.605934685587711,2.673149229007135,2.731603554088023,2.9674191958529437,2.878207028279898,2.902686292364678,2.938298364153555,3.143848349181566,3.2872346624216657,3.3814747511661465,3.3956930001684253,3.4471119148061256,7.349324292426565,4.364659717870332,4.263079925052412,4.213208095012239,4.390138803171316,4.370968887063596,4.4919214974812585,4.662879295624898,5.695894301807195]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.911230382079518E-5,8.851139872337557E-5,8.919949044848122E-5,8.868409484239589E-5,8.868554783144275E-5,8.856158315833315E-5,8.882497771527218E-5,8.852414378644095E-5,8.872317833255079E-5,9.84335231524917E-5,0.9403820372381272,8.838124630095178E-5,9.003083843515761E-5,9.131514812845402E-5,8.844569298377012E-5,8.820126724908632E-5,9.040133752988221E-5,8.883329994520505E-5,8.855769497818003E-5,8.863109356202689E-5,8.948865137542102E-5,8.892131126640493E-5,8.902256166921624E-5,8.911847349472323E-5,8.980241199445612E-5,8.93327706610389E-5,0.05265863741939723,8.84075212351126E-5,8.840988634334524E-5,8.86338722904368E-5,9.051776449655596E-5,8.882815281404413E-5,9.534949726017562E-5,8.907801329984235E-5,8.85037488461864E-5,8.891225198938347E-5,8.841506587815E-5,8.846731267697316E-5,8.82008241187883E-5,8.822370748178041E-5,8.842228832522984E-5,8.935495610564284E-5,8.890090602389091E-5,8.854941669274527E-5,8.962538495529585E-5,8.858340244274798E-5,9.152658901790448E-5,9.018066384792591E-5,8.824563589609841E-5,8.84406641480198E-5,8.840998959367614E-5,9.089817903772389E-5,8.844197997649769E-5,8.82158752325645E-5,8.918417070988559E-5,8.846476028271982E-5,9.513412715542859E-5,8.839185382536005E-5,8.824461538594418E-5,8.866595752461794E-5,8.954544930487947E-5,8.866009176718738E-5,8.822828993481598E-5,8.843371599512185E-5,8.820189092336899E-5,9.02426998640414E-5,8.89617088098894E-5,8.877220734498394E-5,8.869457203755849E-5,8.901787785143792E-5,8.819867317850442E-5,8.869643147771272E-5,9.013502871563377E-5,

{"value":"First be warned that I saw this movie on TV and with dubbed English - which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere. However, I'll rate what I saw and hope that will steer people away from that version. I found this movie excruciatingly dull. All the movie's atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie. I'm sorry, but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy. I didn't see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie. Maybe I missed something, but I have to tell it like I see it. I rated it a \"1\".

{"value":"This is one of the weakest soft porn film around. I can't believe somebody wrote this stupid story before making some changes. The guy Mike is a major wimp and moron I can't believe he didn't want to take a shower with his bride-to-be Toni and be in a threesome with the french photographer Jan. He does do a threesome with Toni and Kristi but that was short I hate that every time in Soft Core Porn Films threesomes between a woman, a man, and a woman is short but a girl-girl thing is about an hour. To the makers of these films have the threesomes alot longer this film should've have two threesome scenes not one but two.","finished_norm":["thi","be","on","of","the","weak","soft","porn","film","around","i","ca","not","believ","somebodi","write","thi","stupid","stori","befor","make","some","chang","the","gui","mike","be","a","major","wimp","and","moron","i","ca","not","believ","he","do","not","want","to","take","a","shower","with","hi","bridetob","toni","and","be","in","a","threesom","with","the","french","photograph","jan","he","doe","do","a","threesom","with","toni","and","kristi","but","that","be","short","i","hate","that","everi","time","in","soft","core","porn","film","threesom","between","a","woman","a","man","and","a","woman","be","short","but","a","girlgirl","thing","be","about","a","hour","to","the","maker","of","thi","film","have","the","threesom","alot","long","thi","film","should","have","have","two","threesom","scene","not","on","but","two"],"filtered":["thi","weak","soft","porn","film","around","ca","believ","somebodi","write","thi","stupid","stori","befor","make","chang","gui","mike","major","wimp","moron","ca","believ","want","take","shower","hi","bridetob","toni","threesom","french","photograph","jan","doe","threesom","toni","kristi","short","hate","everi","time","soft","core","porn","film","threesom","woman","man","woman","short","girlgirl","thing","hour","maker","thi","film","threesom","alot","long","thi","film","two","threesom","scene","two"],"filtered2":["weak","soft","porn","around","ca","believ","somebodi","write","stupid","stori","befor","make","chang","gui","mike","major","wimp","moron","ca","believ","want","take","shower","bridetob","toni","threesom","french","photograph","jan","doe","threesom","toni","kristi","short","hate","everi","time","soft","core","porn","threesom","woman","man","woman","short","girlgirl","thing","hour","maker","threesom","alot","long","two","threesom","scene","two"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,8,17,18,19,29,31,37,45,47,55,65,70,79,81,85,91,98,99,136,174,272,278,339,379,404,762,899,971,1082,1313,1327,1387,1456,1820,1989,2197,5737,5775,5954,6676],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,8,17,18,19,29,31,37,45,47,55,65,70,79,81,85,91,98,99,136,174,272,278,339,379,404,762,899,971,1082,1313,1327,1387,1456,1820,1989,2197,5737,5775,5954,6676],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9418936859054116,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,1.4876543214774305,1.8162961064622165,3.412938870621443,1.9536997889255368,1.9073850067444174,4.189351572503368,1.9469506069506084,3.899514464849456,2.011190219103739,4.021185338082285,2.0881990796736947,2.056430207256609,2.346825985579986,2.456282578459816,5.605761068896383,2.8336934208777267,3.003844442051426,3.1272886331425473,3.1419947805322432,3.749984152751882,4.197121957260614,8.362580984087867,4.165705761027235,4.4919214974812585,4.613282354485526,4.422928625994308,9.617182213612585,4.8184434032493035,9.912454211224713,5.039114765418124,33.972532952376525,6.342521466732247,6.489124940924123,6.543192162194399]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.89979019623979E-5,6.853263297907275E-5,6.906540885125143E-5,6.866634818313046E-5,6.866747320393576E-5,6.857148979877976E-5,6.87754310171962E-5,6.85425012304161E-5,6.869660975988734E-5,7.621513852842551E-5,0.35322609375599073,6.843185852147792E-5,0.19683686664444341,7.070352092926834E-5,6.848175831883749E-5,6.829250428594081E-5,6.999597537844011E-5,6.878187475594378E-5,6.856847925745701E-5,6.862531033549343E-5,6.928930046254308E-5,6.885002018874443E-5,6.892841638171994E-5,6.900267901942116E-5,6.953223913098309E-5,6.916860509515145E-5,7.207632185231534E-5,6.845220268556713E-5,6.845403394229564E-5,6.862746185017981E-5,7.008612248594267E-5,6.877788943364819E-5,7.382723801363862E-5,6.897135148730636E-5,6.852670982981397E-5,0.06290130892782973,6.845804435409454E-5,6.84984980215286E-5,6.829216117887761E-5,6.830987931620097E-5,6.846363655263702E-5,0.34166859052125037,6.883422081130568E-5,6.856206954406892E-5,6.93951705807497E-5,6.858838404101562E-5,7.086723544607047E-5,6.982511209222183E-5,6.832685805557177E-5,6.847786459034873E-5,6.845411388699356E-5,7.038066997367636E-5,6.847888341042659E-5,6.830381495987338E-5,6.905354707934801E-5,6.849652175292247E-5,7.36604811828103E-5,6.844007171873357E-5,6.832606789465623E-5,6.865230481515267E-5,6.933327798080276E-5,6.864776307468837E-5,6.83134274193443E-5,6.847248477238962E-5,6.829298718465588E-5,6.987314535782658E-5,6.888129921111677E-5,6.87345719586874E-5,0.040183007620060635,6.892478979385248E-5,6.82904957481742E-5,6.867590019691126E-5,6.978977770797939E-5,6.841287610981285E-5,7.010605914816116E-5,6.859375280385484E-5,6.913060190834523E-5,6.870810608107214E-5,6.826908466644377E-5,6.835370888564829E-5]}}
{"value":"Renown writer Mark Redfield (as Edgar Allen Poe) tries to conquer old addictions and start a new life for himself, as a Baltimore, Maryland magazine publisher. However, blackouts, delirium, and rejection threaten to thwart his efforts. He would also like to rekindle romance with an old sweetheart, a significantly flawed prospect, as things turns out. Mr. Redfield also directed this dramatization of the mysterious last days of Edgar Allen Poe. Redfield employs a lot of black and white, color, and trick photography to create mood. Kevin G. Shinnick (as Dr. John Moran) performs well, relatively speaking. It's not enough.","finished_norm":["renown","writer","mark","redfield","a","edgar","allen","poe","try","to","conquer","old","addict","and","start","a","new","life","for","himself","a","a","baltimor","maryland","magazin","publish","howev","blackout","delirium","and","reject","threaten","to","thwart","hi","effort","he","would","conjur","like","to","rekindl","romanc","with","a","old","sweetheart","a","significantli","flaw","prospect","a","thing","turn","out","mr","redfield","conjur","direct","thi","dramat","of","the","mysteri","last","dai","of","edgar","allen","poe","redfield","emploi","a","lot","of","black","and","white","color","and","trick","photographi","to","creat","mood","kevin","g","shinnick","a","dr","john","moran","perform","good","rel","speak","it","not","enough"],"filtered":["renown","writer","mark","redfield","edgar","allen","poe","try","conquer","old","addict","start","new","life","baltimor","maryland","magazin","publish","howev","blackout","delirium","reject","threaten","thwart","hi","effort","conjur","like","rekindl","romanc","old","sweetheart","significantli","flaw","prospect","thing","turn","mr","redfield","conjur","direct","thi","dramat","mysteri","last","dai","edgar","allen","poe","redfield","emploi","lot","black","white","color","trick","photographi","creat","mood","kevin","g","shinnick","dr","john","moran","perform","good","rel","speak","enough"],"filtered2":["renown","writer","mark","redfield","edgar","allen","poe","try","conquer","old","addict","start","new","life","baltimor","maryland","magazin","publish","howev","blackout","delirium","reject","threaten","thwart","effort","conjur","like","rekindl","romanc","old","sweetheart","significantli","flaw","prospect","thing","turn","mr","redfield","conjur","direct","dramat","mysteri","last","dai","edgar","allen","poe","redfield","emploi","lot","black","white","color","trick","photographi","creat","mood","kevin","g","shinnick","dr","john","moran","perform","good","rel","speak","enough"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,29,36,39,67,71,72,75,87,93,96,102,105,113,132,144,229,287,291,344,357,359,362,401,403,717,739,756,875,892,921,1129,1165,1345,1371,1436,1485,1639,1896,2210,2367,2606,3162,3811,4229,4346,4587,5411,5769,6877,6995,7069,7620],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,29,36,39,67,71,72,75,87,93,96,102,105,113,132,144,229,287,291,344,357,359,362,401,403,717,739,756,875,892,921,1129,1165,1345,1371,1436,1485,1639,1896,2210,2367,2606,3162,3811,4229,4346,4587,5411,5769,6877,6995,7069,7620],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.3195384777338066,1.4680183469605717,3.1077880109725475,3.9141830778533158,1.9214926742550966,1.9209463754160525,1.9742250248702675,2.115024371522662,2.035389827120098,2.0390708128715254,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.1521782565202803,2.253494045787767,2.2931108769894046,2.8432628718938773,2.841890188081905,3.016831637578237,2.983093497946387,3.2829611516442836,3.2189558216683714,3.058539100262467,3.0879275592619675,3.189397019426827,3.7398317812878634,4.004218291136122,3.7636829971100436,3.9282323841582003,3.9825254665248626,3.9911462095687695,4.197121957260614,4.246178114249808,9.521470171257315,4.403125998698128,4.4919214974812585,4.679973728984199,4.646072177308517,4.85885294158718,5.102830579804232,5.185068678041204,5.2288713006995975,5.541743621979936,5.878215858601149,12.064733076856815,12.978249881848246,6.137727054086234,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141,7.0356686472921925,6.868614562629026,6.660975197850782,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.4884228249879567E-5,5.45141310679055E-5,5.493792645505537E-5,5.462049453072473E-5,0.0528044876031407,5.4545039639053454E-5,5.4707264229407305E-5,5.452198074657328E-5,5.464456603491092E-5,6.0625163086407026E-5,0.22935021377694487,5.443397024887934E-5,5.54499533099281E-5,0.32332594724359887,5.44736629321351E-5,5.43231212309632E-5,5.56781435374205E-5,5.471238988711786E-5,5.4542644910628176E-5,5.458785106574195E-5,5.511602054122137E-5,5.476659602066168E-5,5.482895609867586E-5,5.488802814930507E-5,5.530926556679692E-5,5.502001367863248E-5,0.12742256231340868,5.445015296913123E-5,5.4451609638238747E-5,5.458956248333252E-5,5.5749850854360856E-5,5.4709219771327385E-5,5.8725712912356926E-5,5.486310873329107E-5,5.450941951195045E-5,5.47610164159774E-5,5.445479971141904E-5,5.4486978491553624E-5,5.4322848307209925E-5,5.433694216028895E-5,5.4459248013360034E-5,5.503367768408695E-5,5.4754028440881836E-5,5.4537546318314456E-5,5.5200234692191645E-5,5.455847812661046E-5,0.04578138935449051,5.55422307149489E-5,5.435044786090474E-5,5.447056567443534E-5,5.445167323007159E-5,5.5984148000903286E-5,5.447137609260906E-5,5.4332118281483845E-5,5.492849103487477E-5,5.448540647306934E-5,5.8593066560727334E-5,5.4440

{"value":"One wonders how the script came to be written.<br /><br />Wayne and the other performers do an OK job but as it is neither comedy, romantic thriller or anything else it is all rather disappointing.<br /><br />One feels as if one of the threads had been pursued it could have been something worthwhile. It is nonetheless interesting to see a real turkey of a story made just before the USA became directly involved with the war. I wonder if the surrounding politics had something to do with trying to make a movie for all tastes but ending up with something that pleases no one.<br /><br />Nonetheless it has historical value.","finished_norm":["on","wonder","how","the","script","come","to","be","writtenbr","br","wayn","and","the","other","perform","do","a","okai","job","but","a","it","be","neither","comedi","romant","thriller","or","anyth","els","it","be","all","rather","disappointingbr","br","on","feel","a","if","on","of","the","thread","have","be","pursu","it","can","have","be","someth","worthwhil","it","be","nonetheless","interest","to","see","a","real","turkei","of","a","stori","make","just","befor","the","usa","becom","directli","involv","with","the","war","i","wonder","if","the","surround","polit","have","someth","to","do","with","try","to","make","a","movi","for","all","tast","but","end","up","with","someth","that","pleas","no","onebr","br","nonetheless","it","have","histor","valu"],"filtered":["wonder","script","come","writtenbr","br","wayn","perform","okai","job","neither","comedi","romant","thriller","anyth","els","rather","disappointingbr","br","feel","thread","pursu","someth","worthwhil","nonetheless","interest","see","real","turkei","stori","make","befor","usa","becom","directli","involv","war","wonder","surround","polit","someth","try","make","movi","tast","end","someth","pleas","onebr","br","nonetheless","histor","valu"],"filtered2":["wonder","script","come","writtenbr","wayn","perform","okai","job","neither","comedi","romant","thriller","anyth","els","rather","disappointingbr","feel","thread","pursu","someth","worthwhil","nonetheless","interest","see","real","turkei","stori","make","befor","usa","becom","directli","involv","war","wonder","surround","polit","someth","try","make","tast","end","someth","pleas","onebr","nonetheless","histor","valu"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,17,24,34,36,43,53,60,77,79,80,104,105,115,127,160,175,191,196,241,289,314,346,451,575,714,718,864,872,953,1275,1521,1587,1995,2011,2016,2463,2510,2839,2871,7215,8492],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,17,24,34,36,43,53,60,77,79,80,104,105,115,127,160,175,191,196,241,289,314,346,451,575,714,718,864,872,953,1275,1521,1587,1995,2011,2016,2463,2510,2839,2871,7215,8492],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.2770536940105968,1.3210361566119257,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.6608112036218214,5.100954820682302,1.838176641236591,1.9463902258768238,1.9469506069506084,1.9951803900462557,2.0728240170322856,2.1765612129984904,2.201553588425805,2.4359679371086367,2.3722295531801256,4.758228523915245,2.5460113484259455,2.478925055209576,2.6627744961815836,2.8282659991423613,3.189397019426827,3.023389038124396,3.216957819005698,3.6314455447135003,3.7297814454343623,3.634471265630037,3.9782428047328615,3.857614816944247,4.1302590120314875,4.3095999406873045,4.581533656170946,4.573751515728891,4.890269137820559,5.444579873526289,4.900964426937307,5.185068678041204,5.259176650194926,5.3560264761848435,10.712052952369687,6.725513718988353,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.08854819809996912,8.143984185906665E-5,0.11459675121231017,8.159874054133293E-5,8.160007744482677E-5,8.148601684337015E-5,8.172836767470988E-5,8.14515686641505E-5,8.1634701483126E-5,9.056924503275974E-5,0.7279701127464397,8.132008787423929E-5,8.283788698801832E-5,0.03469686855156674,8.137938563399417E-5,8.11544881240006E-5,8.317878531431864E-5,8.17360250058494E-5,8.14824393066759E-5,8.154997376153012E-5,8.23390175876942E-5,8.181700472353219E-5,8.191016579557546E-5,8.19984148122486E-5,8.262771051950156E-5,8.21955908549653E-5,8.565093734583627E-5,8.134426359074336E-5,8.134643974029271E-5,8.155253048535934E-5,8.328591042917164E-5,8.173128910116573E-5,8.773161525193969E-5,8.19611871565996E-5,8.143280316351428E-5,8.180866923117044E-5,8.135120545975357E-5,8.139927803679077E-5,8.115408039729066E-5,8.117513550985424E-5,8.135785087442897E-5,8.22160038088467E-5,8.179822974372839E-5,8.147482240911928E-5,8.246482693295867E-5,8.1506092891177E-5,8.4214135614483E-5,8.297574220325964E-5,8.119531196870626E-5,8.137475857359121E-5,8.134653474150999E-5,8.363593201419292E-5,8.137596927486472E-5,8.116792901276185E-5,8.205886319393249E-5,8.139692956430754E-5,8.753345199246408E-5,8.132984791783576E-5,8.119437299150362E-5,8.158205229199003E-5,0.028029580147818624,8.157665517518452E-5,8.117935185098008E-5,8.136836553855412E-5,8.115506197025865E-5,8.303282189485734E-5,8.185417473327468E-5,8.167981335658697E-5,8.16083806682485E-5,8.190585618817274E-5,8.115210130489019E-5,8.161009154972017E-5,8.29337530582377E-5,8.12975303780961E-5,8.330960189625372E-5,8.151247278900959E-5,8.215043027395297E-5,8.164836298332748E-5,8.112665773101364E-5,8.12272197950973E-5]}}

{"value":"This is one of those \"so bad it is good\" films that you always hear about but never see! Unlike Troma films which are deliberately bad and campy (and I am not amused) this one is 100% pure serious.<br /><br />However with features such as a supposedly super-lethal killer robot that

{"value":"This wasn't the major disaster that I was expecting, but that is about as positive as I can be in my description of the movie. I'm not sure what was meant to be funny about this movie, but I suppose it's all a matter of taste. Personally, I don't find it funny to watch morons living their idiotic lives or making fools of themselves on television, but then again, I'm not a fan of Jerry Springer's pathetic daytime talk show. I didn't get too bored watching this, but I was definitely never enjoying it, either. If you're in the mood to see a bad movie, but one that isn't too painful to sit through, this is a good choice.","finished_norm":["thi","be","not","the","major","disast","that","i","be","expect","but","that","be","about","a","posit","a","i","can","be","in","my","descript","of","the","movi","i","be","not","sure","what","be","mean","to","be","funni","about","thi","movi","but","i","suppos","it","all","a","matt","of","tast","person","i","do","not","find","it","funni","to","watch","moron","live","their","idiot","live","or","make","fool","of","themselv","on","televis","but","then","again","i","be","not","a","fan","of","jerri","springer","pathet","daytim","talk","show","i","do","not","get","too","bore","watch","thi","but","i","be","definit","never","enjoi","it","either","if","you","re","in","the","mood","to","see","a","bad","movi","but","on","that","be","not","too","pain","to","sit","through","thi","be","a","good","choic"],"filtered":["thi","major","disast","expect","posit","descript","movi","sure","mean","funni","thi","movi","suppos","matt","tast","person","find","funni","watch","moron","live","idiot","live","make","fool","themselv","televis","fan","jerri","springer","pathet","daytim","talk","show","get","bore","watch","thi","definit","never","enjoi","either","re","mood","see","bad","movi","pain","sit","thi","good","choic"],"filtered2":["major","disast","expect","posit","descript","sure","mean","funni","suppos","matt","tast","person","find","funni","watch","moron","live","idiot","live","make","fool","themselv","televis","fan","jerri","springer","pathet","daytim","talk","show","get","bore","watch","definit","never","enjoi","either","re","mood","see","bad","pain","sit","good","choic"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,9,28,38,42,62,68,88,108,116,119,130,140,149,153,186,200,207,244,392,404,408,436,459,509,601,663,706,808,872,1034,1057,1129,1387,1432,2068,2764,5587],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,7,9,28,38,42,62,68,88,108,116,119,130,140,149,153,186,200,207,244,392,404,408,436,459,509,601,663,706,808,872,1034,1057,1129,1387,1432,2068,2764,5587],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.5452294193519092,1.519311641348122,1.6219954307453837,4.045224089013853,2.0064197866819473,2.0317223413467334,2.138507503627933,4.493325799357863,2.1653408989309972,2.2642139034199635,2.317169775997098,2.3253197803590226,2.3409902041158843,2.571852579609833,2.5308211829319704,2.5531798379045583,2.634508058031767,3.0670934723591254,3.1419947805322432,3.130944944345658,3.2070272508030975,3.2829611516442836,3.360519385990158,3.506637894120152,3.7297814454343623,3.6590123745461547,3.8023521382691974,3.857614816944247,4.125296222689358,4.181290492043933,4.197121957260614,4.422928625994308,4.890269137820559,4.944927550358424,6.101359409915359,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.900565955209101E-5,9.833804124409751E-5,9.910252574461519E-5,9.852991029508824E-5,9.853152459673614E-5,9.839379721571078E-5,9.868643415487711E-5,9.835220127947666E-5,9.857333288158274E-5,1.093617319258922E-4,0.7427364637181828,9.81934391423464E-5,1.0002617099009914E-4,1.0145306629862647E-4,9.826504077382489E-5,9.799347859849903E-5,1.0043780334235466E-4,9.869568032884098E-5,9.838947736509516E-5,9.847102474847963E-5,9.942378966733838E-5,9.87934627733502E-5,9.8905954118321E-5,9.901251419067937E-5,9.977238436972104E-5,9.92506028875432E-5,1.03422909684503E-4,9.822263115147133E-5,9.822525883688E-5,9.847411197467787E-5,1.0056715617166053E-4,9.86899617569543E-5,1.0593531374958166E-4,9.896756205603538E-5,9.8329542068292E-5,9.878339772443866E-5,9.823101340990227E-5,9.828906071151143E-5,9.799298627133944E-5,9.801841017296318E-5,9.823903770179082E-5,9.927525138703533E-5,9.877079211613677E-5,9.838028001440074E-5,9.957570357459916E-5,9.841803890346681E-5,1.0168798161131352E-4,1.0019263020137282E-4,9.804277310635619E-5,9.825945363064831E-5,9.822537355018752E-5,1.00989804795214E-4,9.826091554399503E-5,9.8009708377968E-5,9.908550519011494E-5,9.828622494736155E-5,0.1181621090310002,9.820522432694188E-5,9.804163929793057E-5,9.85097593503576E-5,9.948689337160952E-5,9.850324236944378E-5,9.802350137547619E-5,9.825173408541342E-5,9.799417151385475E-5,1.0026155353101594E-4,9.883834530096397E-5,9.862780515426569E-5,9.854155068112757E-5,9.890075029742891E-5,9.799059653106417E-5,9.85436165585763E-5,1.0014192860150827E-4,9.816620112302498E-5,1.005957634529846E-4,9.842574258561884E-5,0.131470938388206,9.858982904782768E-5,9.79598735930015E-5,9.808130158426116E-5]}}

Definitely not worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this bad-to-mediocre confusion.

{"value":"Add to the list of caricatures: a Southern preacher and \"congregation,\" a torch singer (Sophie Tucker?), a dancing chorus, and The Mills Brothers -- it only makes it worse.<br /><br />Contemptible burlesques of \"Negro\" performers, who themselves often appear in films to be parodying themselves and their race.

As an 11-year-old white boy, however, I might not have understood some of it.","finished_norm":["add","to","the","list","of","caricatur","a","southern","preacher","and","congreg","a","torch","singer","sophi","tucker","a","danc","choru","and","the","mill","brother","it","onli","make","it","worsebr","br","contempt","burlesqu","of","negro","perform","who","themselv","often","appear","in","film","to","be","parodi","themselv","and","their","race","though","the","negro","comedi","mai","have","be","accept","in","it","dai","it","extrem","offens","todai","and","i","doubt","that","it","be","ever","funni","though","i","would","not","have","be","offend","i","do","not","think","that","i","have","have","laugh","at","the","feebl","attempt","at","humor","a","a","yearold","white","boi","howev","i","mai","not","have","understand","some","of","it"],"filtered":["add","list","caricatur","southern","preacher","congreg","torch","singer","sophi","tucker","danc","choru","mill","brother","onli","make","worsebr","br","contempt","burlesqu","negro","perform","themselv","often","appear","film","parodi","themselv","race","though","negro","comedi","mai","accept","dai","extrem","offens","todai","doubt","ever","funni","though","offend","think","laugh","feebl","attempt","humor","yearold","white","boi","howev","mai","understand"],"filtered2":["add","list","caricatur","southern","preacher","congreg","torch","singer","sophi","tucker","danc","choru","mill","brother","onli","make","worsebr","contempt","burlesqu","negro","perform","themselv","often","appear","parodi","themselv","race","though","negro","comedi","mai","accept","dai","extrem","offens","todai","doubt","ever","funni","though","offend","think","laugh","feebl","attempt","humor","yearold","white","boi","howev","mai","understand"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,11,12,44,46,62,86,105,113,127,132,133,169,177,212,282,299,329,359,369,381,400,436,492,567,602,742,789,1123,1145,1294,1452,1629,1646,2008,2133,3134,3282,3327,3423,3747,3992,5246,5654],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,11,12,44,46,62,86,105,113,127,132,133,169,177,212,282,299,329,359,369,381,400,436,492,567,602,742,789,1123,1145,1294,1452,1629,1646,2008,2133,3134,3282,3327,3423,3747,3992,5246,5654],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.604729392502474,3.311542587503466,2.0226120445069267,4.062224798544638,2.1765612129984904,2.1521782565202803,2.4359679371086367,2.253494045787767,2.3212364753796515,2.4214486257841834,2.458149992634611,2.5983793339432615,2.918851229218033,2.7949961309240425,2.951986790814132,3.2189558216683714,3.121829110937649,3.24941502915308,3.130944944345658,6.414054501606195,3.6016814428070463,3.454678155189441,3.555828138310924,3.7165362186843414,3.8059428063999263,4.390138803171316,4.2574141875167335,4.605250182788262,4.74221603786142,4.679973728984199,4.77960356993304,5.0768550934009715,5.014723312293965,6.032366538428407,5.541743621979936,5.583416318380505,5.626901430320244,5.695894301807195,5.907203395474402,6.389041482367141,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.511520754219352E-5,7.46086881372345E-5,7.51886995444507E-5,7.475425843747083E-5,7.475548320183142E-5,7.465098997531522E-5,7.487301247907348E-5,7.46194313008185E-5,7.478720298439177E-5,8.297231923862911E-5,0.8324603903601193,7.449897908693161E-5,7.588946558776344E-5,7.697204549002267E-5,7.455330296531592E-5,7.434726980264123E-5,0.0624843166888048,7.488002751517756E-5,7.464771252151097E-5,7.4709582203054E-5,7.543244122891951E-5,7.49542146742402E-5,7.5039561418683E-5,7.512040812974094E-5,7.569691866926023E-5,7.530104509493351E-5,0.0709175249243121,7.452112695033571E-5,7.4523120565001E-5,7.4711924469523E-5,7.62999089338719E-5,7.48756888570033E-5,8.037270913952669E-5,7.50863031206079E-5,7.460223984571808E-5,7.49465783609089E-5,7.452748653709632E-5,7.457152679830322E-5,7.434689627594651E-5,7.436618529089412E-5,7.453357453603814E-5,0.028423083136848437,7.493701453508241E-5,7.464073452743087E-5,7.554769771752899E-5,7.46693820492149E-5,7.715027482102412E-5,7.601575754176587E-5,7.438466935338543E-5,7.454906402159114E-5,7.452320759753974E-5,7.662057079521668E-5,7.455017316954231E-5,7.435958327298919E-5,7.517578611617243E-5,7.4569375315109E-5,8.019116776507194E-5,7.450792046049367E-5,7.438380913735748E-5,7.47389699943408E-5,7.548031776309394E-5,7.473402558635338E-5,7.437004796637282E-5,7.45432072327462E-5,7.434779551481758E-5,7.60680494029995E-5,7.498826687279107E-5,7.482853088510357E-5,7.47630899529334E-5,7.503561330007957E-5,7.434508318932539E-5,7.476465732609185E-5,7.59772904358067E-5,7.447831370796618E-5,7.632161316657534E-5,7.467522680280078E-5,7.525967257224767E-5,7.479971856134712E-5,7.432177381611054E-5,7.441390075921828E-5]}}
{"value":"When I saw the preview, I thought: this is going to be a great movie. And indeed it could have been. The actress playing the main character was very credible, and the beauty of the filming is undeniable. However the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture. The level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610, and it took away most of the magic of the film. However, I must congratulate the translator, because the English sub-titles were more refined and appropriate that the original French cues, and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the

{"value":"Another trashy Grade Z quickie from the prolific Albert Pyun. Tim Thomerson´s 13 inch Clint Eastwood-like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head(!) to Earth and gets involved in a gang war in South Bronx! Mercifully short, but deadeningly dull, with the cheesiest effects since Attack of the 50Ft Woman. They should have fired the continuity guy, too: Note how Thomerson´s sunglasses disappears and reappears in every second shot. Laughably bad, but that´s why we watch these movies, ain´t it?

{"value":"A bondage, humiliation, S&M show, and not much else. The plot is flat, really just a banal setup for the stylishly depraved set-pieces. The host of the aforementioned show, a silly little man who spouts drivel while prancing around the stage in dresses, was almost as painfully distracting as the attempts at artful editing. The dream-like ending felt tacked on. To the film's credit though, Aya Sugimoto was fairly convincing as the tortured lead. Flower and Snake has been compared with Eyes Wide Shut but aside from some minor surface similarities, Kubrick's is easily the more layered, artistic, and atmospheric picture.","finished_norm":["a","bondag","humili","sm","show","and","not","much","els","the","plot","be","flat","realli","just","a","banal","setup","for","the","stylishli","deprav","setpiec","the","host","of","the","aforement","show","a","silli","littl","man","who","spout","drivel","while","pranc","around","the","stage","in","dress","be","almost","a","painfulli","distract","a","the","attempt","at","art","edit","the","dreamlik","end","feel","tack","on","to","the","film","credit","though","aya","sugimoto","be","fairli","convinc","a","the","tortur","lead","flower","and","snake","have","be","compar","with","ey","wide","shut","but","asid","from","some","minor","surfac","similar","kubrick","be","easili","the","much","layer","artist","and","atmospher","pictur"],"filtered":["bondag","humili","sm","show","much","els","plot","flat","realli","banal","setup","stylishli","deprav","setpiec","host","aforement","show","silli","littl","man","spout","drivel","pranc","around","stage","dress","almost","painfulli","distract","attempt","art","edit","dreamlik","end","feel","tack","film","credit","though","aya","sugimoto","fairli","convinc","tortur","lead","flower","snake","compar","ey","wide","shut","asid","minor","surfac","similar","kubrick","easili","much","layer","artist","atmospher","pictur"],"filtered2":["bondag","humili","sm","show","els","plot","flat","realli","banal","setup","stylishli","deprav","setpiec","host","aforement","show","silli","littl","man","spout","drivel","pranc","around","stage","dress","almost","painfulli","distract","attempt","art","edit","dreamlik","end","feel","tack","credit","though","aya","sugimoto","fairli","convinc","tortur","lead","flower","snake","compar","ey","wide","shut","asid","minor","surfac","similar","kubrick","easili","layer","artist","atmospher","pictur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[13,14,24,28,32,43,45,86,98,131,157,177,196,281,311,348,356,382,385,478,482,583,591,594,669,724,802,819,835,873,936,1097,1240,1356,1582,1647,1711,1940,1985,2123,2145,2360,2663,2850,3005,3379,3751,3808,4576,4659,4929,5547,5788,6116,7772],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[13,14,24,28,32,43,45,86,98,131,157,177,196,281,311,348,356,382,385,478,482,583,591,594,669,724,802,819,835,873,936,1097,1240,1356,1582,1647,1711,1940,1985,2123,2145,2360,2663,2850,3005,3379,3751,3808,4576,4659,4929,5547,5788,6116,7772],"values":[1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.3210361566119257,3.0904588387038183,1.3711311285073675,1.6608112036218214,1.8162961064622165,2.031112399272319,2.0881990796736947,2.2512118082053005,2.3360150694757706,2.458149992634611,2.478925055209576,2.832333801361687,2.9203338091782562,3.0103169565570433,3.028335462059722,3.235085203598255,3.09496984188738,3.3243163373261977,3.3154667220492153,3.4986697244709752,3.530930586689197,3.490764544963862,3.7099788181381825,3.7987743169213135,3.8883864756110005,3.835141961092188,3.8614098879127985,3.892300374932137,3.965503778955432,4.186539847930077,4.3095999406873045,4.396611317676934,4.621379564718146,5.143104478942172,4.724033718778229,4.85885294158718,4.869215728622727,5.051537285416681,5.064116067623542,5.064116067623542,5.243909178064138,5.390512652256013,5.521540914662417,6.101359409915359,5.719991853386255,5.822646007446338,6.137727054086234,6.137727054086234,6.137727054086234,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141,6.437831646536572,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.6480166431003996E-5,5.6099307464774716E-5,5.6535426086866656E-5,5.620876379264467E-5,5.620968470995541E-5,5.6131114803572175E-5,5.6298056603695007E-5,5.610738539848579E-5,5.623353525442948E-5,0.12828142296432724,0.24612915590191864,5.6016815708140553E-5,5.7062341794757993E-5,5.787634863911258E-5,5.6057662585793126E-5,5.5902743393010006E-5,5.729716739835437E-5,5.6303331306643225E-5,5.612865044059706E-5,5.6175171112308205E-5,5.6718698840220076E-5,5.635911366055003E-5,5.642328706149238E-5,5.648407682491528E-5,0.036198361241902184,5.661990026455547E-5,0.04190066057061129,5.6033468993834434E-5,5.603496802035354E-5,0.04154955377730925,5.737095983972155E-5,5.630006900938296E-5,0.302571883063017,5.645843279549709E-5,5.609445890494295E-5,5.6353371810637285E-5,5.603825085532992E-5,5.607136533858863E-5,5.5902462533107275E-5,5.5916966210993265E-5,5.604282850617742E-5,5.663396159559339E-5,5.6346180637344E-5,5.6123403590060485E-5,5.680536179266229E-5,5.6144944059043264E-5,5.801036174520956E-5,5.715730246669579E-5,5.593086463396232E-5,5.60544752652105E-5,5.60350334613266E-5,5.761206994098374E-5,5.605530924893934E-5,5.591200206215774E-5,5.652571630102944E-5,5.60697476085329E-5,0.15682364961309278,5.602353885094253E-5,5.593021782559935E-5,5.619726820019797E-5,5.675469787033382E-5,5.619355043125117E-5,5.591987061026266E-5,5.60500714644

{"value":"I heard about this film and knew it wasn't real good. But I started watching the film (on my film-channel)and was interested. This could be a really great, darkly black satire on todays morals in media. The small featurettes on every contestent were good. It build up to something I wouldn't wanna miss. But when the so called show starts everything becomes implausible, cheap and rather silly. Here's where the writer should have added something that would make people think. But instead it's wrapped up and assuming people are this dumb.<br /><br />The ending is so bad I give it a 1. Even if the film starts of promising.","finished_norm":["i","hear","about","thi","film","and","know","it","be","not","real","good","but","i","start","watch","the","film","on","my","filmchanneland","be","interest","thi","can","be","a","realli","great","darkli","black","satir","on","todai","moral","in","medium","the","small","featurett","on","everi","contest","be","good","it","build","up","to","someth","i","would","not","wanna","miss","but","when","the","so","call","show","start","everyth","becom","implaus","cheap","and","rather","silli","here","where","the","writer","should","have","add","someth","that","would","make","peopl","think","but","instead","it","wrap","up","and","assum","peopl","be","thi","dumbbr","br","the","end","be","so","bad","i","give","it","a","even","if","the","film","start","of","promis"],"filtered":["hear","thi","film","know","real","good","start","watch","film","filmchanneland","interest","thi","realli","great","darkli","black","satir","todai","moral","medium","small","featurett","everi","contest","good","build","someth","wanna","miss","call","show","start","everyth","becom","implaus","cheap","rather","silli","writer","add","someth","make","peopl","think","instead","wrap","assum","peopl","thi","dumbbr","br","end","bad","give","even","film","start","promis"],"filtered2":["hear","know","real","good","start","watch","filmchanneland","interest","realli","great","darkli","black","satir","todai","moral","medium","small","featurett","everi","contest","good","build","someth","wanna","miss","call","show","start","everyth","becom","implaus","cheap","rather","silli","writer","add","someth","make","peopl","think","instead","wrap","assum","peopl","dumbbr","end","bad","give","even","start","promis"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,7,9,12,13,23,24,26,28,30,51,53,60,71,80,85,115,142,152,160,193,216,229,255,287,299,351,363,385,477,683,789,878,920,1245,1279,1910,1988,2018,2044,7688,8072],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,5,7,9,12,13,23,24,26,28,30,51,53,60,71,80,85,115,142,152,160,193,216,229,255,287,299,351,363,385,477,683,789,878,920,1245,1279,1910,1988,2018,2044,7688,8072],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.1317941569733974,2.729695454751562,1.3210361566119257,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.3364419891718522,1.7139899308309823,3.400636547121535,1.838176641236591,5.76447802276529,1.9951803900462557,2.011190219103739,2.201553588425805,2.2844323215331563,2.3131195476980753,2.3722295531801256,2.517840471459249,2.6070186965339692,2.8432628718938773,2.6754694156628323,2.841890188081905,2.7949961309240425,3.0135689919434205,3.0349689855553557,3.09496984188738,3.351345009714117,3.6105180246075443,3.8059428063999263,4.067587905068712,3.952924996748572,4.409683399244287,4.535724120139652,5.390512652256013,4.911775343041523,5.00274712124725,4.9676558014359795,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.547680254677995E-5,9.48329801465527E-5,9.557021613928497E-5,9.501801041228858E-5,9.501956717541085E-5,9.488674880903732E-5,9.516895529485924E-5,9.484663547603654E-5,9.505988528828619E-5,1.0546375361267684E-4,0.7973022368482314,9.469353209500493E-5,9.64609399133127E-5,9.783697641711996E-5,9.476258163077517E-5,9.450069874135188E-5,9.685790046078008E-5,9.517787190760497E-5,9.488258293078223E-5,9.496122372219587E-5,9.588002925758562E-5,9.527216909414143E-5,9.538065091205558E-5,9.548341286560406E-5,9.621619900504062E-5,9.571301537117727E-5,0.12829958889817417,9.472168361385521E-5,9.472421764071847E-5,0.06703677044365729,9.698264276943574E-5,9.517235716267681E-5,1.0215946319996385E-4,9.544006295911512E-5,9.482478390672293E-5,9.526246279359358E-5,9.472976710359436E-5,9.478574542623958E-5,9.450022396220069E-5,9.452474168014005E-5,9.473750538578637E-5,9.573678532462974E-5,9.525030648676964E-5,9.4873713401099E-5,9.602652850008616E-5,9.491012645073734E-5,9.806351864739352E-5,9.662146602180763E-5,9.454823624592093E-5,9.475719363004589E-5,9.472432826530155E-5,9.739022693543437E-5,9.475860343644055E-5,9.451635004307288E-5,9.55538022481134E-5,9.478301073718209E-5,1.0192871112551673E-4,9.470489722047038E-5,9.454714284980935E-5,9.499857770733129E-5,9.59408837576205E-5,9.499229301105509E-5,9.452965141701023E-5,9.474974923242783E-5,9.450136695913759E-5,9.668793271840835E-5,9.531545187460234E-5,9.511241600669919E-5,9.502923590025032E-5,9.537563257086124E-5,9.449791939939658E-5,9.503122814366498E-5,9.657257157818719E-5,9.46672649199335E-5,9.701023040192801E-5,9.491755555068012E-5,9.566042793504301E-5,9.507579348196393E-5,9.446829151848213E-5,9.458539145395653E-5]}}
{"value":"Mean spirited, and down right degrading adaptation to the classic children's tale not only lacks the charm of its forefather but lacks any talent what so ever. Mike Myers should not only be ashamed of himself for his horrible performance that is a clear rip off of what Jim Carrey did but he should give up acting all together. He is so annoying that you would want to beat the crap out of him if you were able to jump right in the film. The sets are ugly and the cinematography is very poor. I have seen a lot of bad film this year, but this not only takes the cake but it is with out a doubt one the worse films ever

{"value":"Documentary about nomadic Persians making a treacherous traverse of massive mountains to get their herds to grass. Watching this silent, black and white feature, marred in part by a twink-twink-twink Oriental music score that could not have been used in the original exhibition, is even duller than it sounds. The spectacular scenery is lost on a small black and white screen, and there is an utter failure to establish any kind of plot line. I loved Nanook of the North and March of the Penguins, but despised this movie, notwithstanding the similarity of the theme. Physical hardships alone are just not that interesting.","finished_norm":["documentari","about","nomad","persian","make","a","treacher","travers","of","massiv","mountain","to","get","their","herd","to","grass","watch","thi","silent","black","and","white","featur","mar","in","part","by","a","twinktwinktwink","orient","music","score","that","can","not","have","be","us","in","the","origin","exhibit","be","even","dull","than","it","sound","the","spectacular","sceneri","be","lose","on","a","small","black","and","white","screen","and","there","be","a","utter","failur","to","establish","ani","kind","of","plot","line","i","love","nanook","of","the","north","and","march","of","the","penguin","but","despis","thi","movi","notwithstand","the","similar","of","the","theme","physic","hardship","alon","be","just","not","that","interest"],"filtered":["documentari","nomad","persian","make","treacher","travers","massiv","mountain","get","herd","grass","watch","thi","silent","black","white","featur","mar","part","twinktwinktwink","orient","music","score","us","origin","exhibit","even","dull","sound","spectacular","sceneri","lose","small","black","white","screen","utter","failur","establish","ani","kind","plot","line","love","nanook","north","march","penguin","despis","thi","movi","notwithstand","similar","theme","physic","hardship","alon","interest"],"filtered2":["documentari","nomad","persian","make","treacher","travers","massiv","mountain","get","herd","grass","watch","silent","black","white","featur","mar","part","twinktwinktwink","orient","music","score","us","origin","exhibit","even","dull","sound","spectacular","sceneri","lose","small","black","white","screen","utter","failur","establish","ani","kind","plot","line","love","nanook","north","march","penguin","despis","notwithstand","similar","theme","physic","hardship","alon","interest"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,7,27,32,54,56,60,61,69,107,118,122,178,192,221,229,305,359,363,367,457,518,533,591,624,970,1024,1138,1225,1267,1524,1667,1701,2161,2393,2829,2996,3500,3519,3618,4467,4675,6095,6741,7785],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,5,7,27,32,54,56,60,61,69,107,118,122,178,192,221,229,305,359,363,367,457,518,533,591,624,970,1024,1138,1225,1267,1524,1667,1701,2161,2393,2829,2996,3500,3519,3618,4467,4675,6095,6741,7785],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,1.3002700588679295,1.3711311285073675,1.8113893252729412,1.8610609350701788,1.838176641236591,1.8818517047392527,2.127032521151058,2.1439533986393955,2.354379525480895,2.2489347673732487,2.532833256045391,2.5318267134339894,2.6423424573643777,5.6865257437877545,2.8612813773965557,6.437911643336743,3.0349689855553557,3.0791938792932125,3.3243163373261977,3.4101163271295305,3.4933926673701317,3.530930586689197,3.9241755834625858,4.086456389373095,4.072271754381138,4.224077767249142,4.470719289830655,4.327618446189983,4.605250182788262,4.8796870284900224,4.706176101378222,5.143104478942172,5.339219357868463,5.322690055917252,5.482320201509136,5.604922523601468,5.695894301807195,5.719991853386255,6.342521466732247,6.101359409915359,6.437831646536572,6.543192162194399,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.03457843299155E-5,6.9871426260677E-5,7.041460997401498E-5,7.000775360743317E-5,7.000890060565609E-5,6.99110421530609E-5,7.011896738786762E-5,6.988148728950497E-5,0.0764310197922637,0.18329896399766976,0.4684945515361275,6.976868316185361E-5,7.107088103498377E-5,7.208472276978097E-5,6.981955775779533E-5,6.962660662445548E-5,7.136335523096392E-5,7.012553700583169E-5,6.990797280044895E-5,6.996591408047461E-5,7.064287533503687E-5,7.019501366791158E-5,7.027494134000728E-5,7.035065470732602E-5,7.089055983977429E-5,7.051982216903222E-5,7.348434152504691E-5,6.97894247516511E-5,6.979129178220149E-5,6.996810762526085E-5,7.14552633731245E-5,7.012147382978261E-5,7.526946204554237E-5,7.031871518807894E-5,6.986538740198043E-5,7.018786222057812E-5,6.979538053788037E-5,6.983662447260496E-5,6.962625681475425E-5,6.964432107803514E-5,0.0187460474270245,7.053733549137332E-5,7.017890564772194E-5,6.990143787253389E-5,7.075081363881898E-5,6.9928266426364E-5,7.225163546948762E-5,7.118915410976518E-5,6.966163149913494E-5,6.981558796484917E-5,6.979137328862876E-5,0.07033006195342424,6.981662668770059E-5,6.963813825377254E-5,0.060705281486465486,6.983460959735237E-5,0.11686165774470422,6.977705680491192E-5,6.966082590233026E-5,6.999343590056187E-5,7.068771195943955E-5,6.998880543664779E-5,6.96479384938029E-5,6.981010305149496E-5,6.96270989566554E-5,7.123812571102827E-5,7.022690372977252E-5,7.007731014270457E-5,7.001602436780731E-5,7.02712439063068E-5,6.962455884966043E-5,7.001749222095951E-5,7.115312946404907E-5,6.974932992647871E-5,7.14755895004529E-5,6.993374006863521E-5,7.048107658537117E

{"value":"Based on one of the books by Gabriel Marquez and it might be brilliant literature, this cinema-adaption really sucks as it's more like fighting against sleep rather than enjoying some cinematographic delices. The story is about an old couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and wherein the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money for a forthcoming cockfight. I am in no mood to spill more words on this useless pretentious piece, just perhaps that you can see Salma Hayek in here, but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that?

{"value":"This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen!! There was absolutely nothing good to say about this movie. I have seen some bad movies but this one takes it. There is no plot and most of the movie you are either fast forwarding the movie to get it done faster or you are wondering what the hell is going on because you can't seriously think that someone thought of this movie and you are watching it. I feel sorry for anyone who has to sit through this painful hour and a half. Please take my advice and DO NOT WATCH this movie for I know you will think it is the biggest waste of time you have ever spent in your life.","finished_norm":["thi","be","the","absolut","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","there","be","absolut","noth","good","to","sai","about","thi","movi","i","have","see","some","bad","movi","but","thi","on","take","it","there","be","no","plot","and","much","of","the","movi","you","be","either","fast","forward","the","movi","to","get","it","do","fast","or","you","be","wonder","what","the","hell","be","go","on","becaus","you","ca","not","serious","think","that","someon","think","of","thi","movi","and","you","be","watch","it","i","feel","sorri","for","anyon","who","have","to","sit","through","thi","pain","hour","and","a","half","pleas","take","my","advic","and","do","not","watch","thi","movi","for","i","know","you","will","think","it","be","the","big","wast","of","time","you","have","ever","spend","in","your","life"],"filtered":["thi","absolut","wrong","movi","ever","see","absolut","noth","good","sai","thi","movi","see","bad","movi","thi","take","plot","much","movi","either","fast","forward","movi","get","fast","wonder","hell","go","becaus","ca","serious","think","someon","think","thi","movi","watch","feel","sorri","anyon","sit","thi","pain","hour","half","pleas","take","advic","watch","thi","movi","know","think","big","wast","time","ever","spend","life"],"filtered2":["absolut","wrong","ever","see","absolut","noth","good","see","bad","take","plot","either","fast","forward","get","fast","wonder","hell","go","becaus","ca","serious","think","someon","think","watch","feel","sorri","anyon","sit","pain","hour","half","pleas","take","advic","watch","know","think","big","wast","time","ever","spend","life"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,7,8,9,12,22,25,26,31,32,43,44,49,75,81,82,89,139,158,174,175,206,207,222,244,283,346,371,394,437,459,542,699,1283],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,7,8,9,12,22,25,26,31,32,43,44,49,75,81,82,89,139,158,174,175,206,207,222,244,283,346,371,394,437,459,542,699,1283],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.0683570856722073,3.200185830788664,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3324924169710188,2.814133962290301,1.3711311285073675,1.6608112036218214,3.209458785004948,1.6920303308087352,1.9742250248702675,1.949757232424728,2.020196584395323,1.9940046109572438,2.2939035841256437,2.3106972614914807,2.456282578459816,2.3791142619576227,2.597304642813496,2.5531798379045583,5.154203870991953,2.634508058031767,2.7678802023081546,3.023389038124396,3.0466846007279185,3.0967381889441223,3.1952392950510555,3.2829611516442836,6.894223829612251,3.5813614403160887,4.3773181147422555]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.3714029120391423E-4,1.362155221595434E-4,1.3727446795613912E-4,1.3648129461785467E-4,1.364835307102062E-4,1.3629275400889418E-4,1.366981077556987E-4,1.362351363046755E-4,1.36541442554686E-4,1.5148527701075757E-4,0.9891466161380086,1.3601522275814997E-4,1.3855387944137985E-4,1.4053038097689035E-4,1.3611440363968806E-4,1.3573824215586336E-4,1.3912406281183225E-4,1.3671091533655483E-4,1.36286770254288E-4,1.3639972775545366E-4,1.3771947512153647E-4,1.3684636125929593E-4,1.370021816020623E-4,1.3714978608669526E-4,1.3820234023463382E-4,1.3747958090214304E-4,1.432589613104528E-4,1.3605565883675734E-4,1.360592986442569E-4,1.3640400410795466E-4,1.3930323928274625E-4,1.3670299410642152E-4,1.4673908448054127E-4,1.3708751945604807E-4,1.362037493028175E-4,1.3683241939228596E-4,1.3606726974230924E-4,1.361476754876201E-4,1.3573756019595988E-4,1.3577277678143582E-4,1.360783848010976E-4,1.375137234189788E-4,1.3681495840267034E-4,1.362740303022666E-4,1.3792990266248636E-4,1.363263330197626E-4,1.408557800958489E-4,1.3878445479243478E-4,1.3580652373888468E-4,1.3610666446148653E-4,1.3605945754240946E-4,1.3988868213089535E-4,1.361086894691779E-4,1.357607232614145E-4,1.372508914877718E-4,1.3614374745438384E-4,1.4640763780232455E-4,1.3603154731630783E-4,1.3580495321434736E-4,1.3645338200719286E-4,1.378068848758772E-4,1.364443548398134E-4,1.3577982899439384E-4,1.3609597153053425E-4,1.357392019657782E-4,1.3887992575379964E-4,1.3690853147193597E-4,1.3661689625472774E-4,1.3649741860448716E-4,1.3699497339279685E-4,1.3573424998441504E-4,1.3650028020892666E-4,1.3871422413894098E-4,1.3597749329986994E-4,1.3934286541027356E-4,1.3633700397754878E-4,1.3740404573430386E-4,1.3656429265288051E-4,1.3569169329935668E-4,1.358598924725857E-4]}}

{"value":"I absolutely adore the 'Toxic Avenger' series, but this weak offering by the Troma people didn't make any sense, and it had me yawning all the time.<br /><br />A leaking nuclear plant (and the growing weed next to it) makes the youngsters of Tromaville High go nuts, which causes them to join a gang, have sex, explode, and whatever. Also there's some sort of monster breeding in the high school... my God, this movie's a mess.<br /><br />The actors pretty much stopped their efforts after this one and they should.

{"value":"This really is the most dreadful film I have ever seen. I simply have no idea how anyone has the audacity to put this on release.<br /><br />The production standards are atrocious. There is no pretence here at cinematography. The camera work, scripting, acting and sound are unbelievably crass. I think there is a plot, but it could have been done in 10 minutes sparing us the time to watch it. The hysterical neurotic girls at the centre of this piece have no credibility whatsoever.<br /><br />I would urge anyone to avoid spending any time or money on this Title.

{"value":"This movie has no plot and no focus. Yes, it's supposed to be a slap-stick, stupid comedy, but the screen-writers have no idea what the movie was about. Even the title doesn't go along with the movie. It should have been called \"Cool Ethan\" or \"Cheaters Never Win\" or something like that. The characters are not developed and no one cares what happens to them! The girl roommate character (from That 70's Show) was the only person worth watching. She was hilarious and stole every scene she was in. The others need to make sure that their own college diplomas are in the works since they'll need a career other than acting.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","have","no","plot","and","no","focu","ye","it","suppos","to","be","a","slapstick","stupid","comedi","but","the","screenwrit","have","no","idea","what","the","movi","be","about","even","the","titl","doe","not","go","along","with","the","movi","it","should","have","be","call","cool","ethan","or","cheater","never","win","or","someth","like","that","the","charact","be","not","develop","and","no","on","care","what","happen","to","them","the","girl","roommat","charact","from","that","show","be","the","onli","person","worth","watch","she","be","hilari","and","steal","everi","scene","she","be","in","the","other","ne","to","make","sure","that","their","own","colleg","diploma","be","in","the","work","sinc","thei","will","ne","a","career","other","than","act"],"filtered":["thi","movi","plot","focu","ye","suppos","slapstick","stupid","comedi","screenwrit","idea","movi","even","titl","doe","go","along","movi","call","cool","ethan","cheater","never","win","someth","like","charact","develop","care","happen","girl","roommat","charact","show","onli","person","worth","watch","hilari","steal","everi","scene","ne","make","sure","colleg","diploma","work","sinc","thei","ne","career","act"],"filtered2":["plot","focu","ye","suppos","slapstick","stupid","comedi","screenwrit","idea","even","titl","doe","go","along","call","cool","ethan","cheater","never","win","someth","like","charact","develop","care","happen","girl","roommat","charact","show","onli","person","worth","watch","hilari","steal","everi","scene","ne","make","sure","colleg","diploma","work","sinc","ne","career","act"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,6,7,10,11,18,19,21,28,32,42,48,53,84,85,94,110,119,123,127,136,142,149,153,162,205,209,219,264,320,324,481,489,511,578,619,632,814,1503,2117,3465,4269],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,5,6,7,10,11,18,19,21,28,32,42,48,53,84,85,94,110,119,123,127,136,142,149,153,162,205,209,219,264,320,324,481,489,511,578,619,632,814,1503,2117,3465,4269],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.162015545335049,1.5452294193519092,1.3711311285073675,1.6219954307453837,1.6955116224012472,1.7003182735607676,2.2212694515902225,2.011190219103739,2.08112281984698,4.2580959472608155,2.1653408989309972,2.2619070973220485,2.4359679371086367,2.346825985579986,2.2844323215331563,2.3253197803590226,2.3409902041158843,2.3586007221245198,2.571852579609833,2.6026896854443837,2.5792094178355414,2.757740698455715,2.938298364153555,2.8753661172782943,3.353630724994973,3.3956930001684253,3.3909310864081816,3.575630765607104,3.5929222627171646,3.541919708264792,3.9363956947973615,4.605250182788262,5.02684467282631,5.850044981634453,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1030013352937122E-4,1.0955635394291646E-4,1.1040805012745497E-4,1.0977011123760219E-4,1.0977190969728747E-4,1.0961847050414969E-4,1.099444911943981E-4,1.0957212934202159E-4,1.0981848743256116E-4,1.2183761705140266E-4,0.8294174148103896,1.093952557672775E-4,1.1143706396738648E-4,1.1302673817161912E-4,1.0947502564658264E-4,1.0917248390972154E-4,1.1189565495727735E-4,1.099547921633272E-4,1.0961365784897538E-4,1.0970450808235568E-4,1.1076596354104011E-4,1.1006372953857413E-4,1.1018905379202906E-4,1.1030777013878337E-4,1.1115432560432406E-4,1.1057301977375094E-4,1.152212994671763E-4,1.0942777797377597E-4,1.0943070542310322E-4,1.0970794749646029E-4,1.1203976423758908E-4,1.0994842122205422E-4,1.18020316261889E-4,1.1025768990623816E-4,1.0954688518900402E-4,1.1005251627820149E-4,1.0943711647248799E-4,1.095017857565216E-4,1.0917193541833542E-4,1.0920025965511765E-4,1.0944605616816588E-4,1.1060048015124432E-4,1.1003847263377541E-4,1.096034112730291E-4,1.1093520764619167E-4,1.0964547766120075E-4,1.1328845240568108E-4,1.1162251269136595E-4,1.0922740188939572E-4,1.0946880112728535E-4,1.0943083322279863E-4,0.09341704493564397,1.0947042981435313E-4,1.0919056516740599E-4,1.1038908788385581E-4,1.0949862649102299E-4,1.1775373858076874E-4,1.094083853948203E-4,1.0922613873715463E-4,1.0974766149175344E-4,1.1083626605746993E-4,1.0974040105969072E-4,1.0920593165729966E-4,1.094602009434772E-4,1.0917325587221951E-4,1.1169929873064206E-4,1.1011373222338358E-4,1.0987917385167861E-4,1.0978307954810363E-4,1.1018325632406755E-4,1.0916927305870207E-4,1.0978538109893901E-4,0.0686603829355124,1.093649104599302E-4,1.1207163501108053E-4,1.0965406017228024E-4,1.1051226783115488E-4,1.0983686546617835E-4,1.0913504527631006E-4,1.0927032566038847E-4]}}

For me the most pitiable moment came when the trip from LA was signified by a plane landing at what appeared to be LAX; and the return was signified by a shot of a Fedex cargo plane.","finished_norm":["if","a","auteur","give","himself","credit","befor","the","main","titl","and","about","much","credit","befor","the","movi","start","and","the","shoot","show","the","auteur","roll","around","on","a","bed","in","lycra","bike","short","it","wo","not","be","a","surpris","to","observ","that","sai","auteur","have","the","kind","of","bodi","that","should","never","be","see","in","spandex","the","kind","of","look","that","mai","be","us","to","a","homosexu","avers","therapistbr","br","other","have","give","thi","thing","the","dish","it","deserv","for","me","the","much","pitiabl","moment","come","when","the","trip","from","la","be","signifi","by","a","plane","land","at","what","appear","to","be","lax","and","the","return","be","signifi","by","a","shoot","of","a","fedex","cargo","plane"],"filtered":["auteur","give","credit","befor","main","titl","much","credit","befor","movi","start","shoot","show","auteur","roll","around","bed","lycra","bike","short","wo","surpris","observ","sai","auteur","kind","bodi","never","see","spandex","kind","look","mai","us","homosexu","avers","therapistbr","br","give","thi","thing","dish","deserv","much","pitiabl","moment","come","trip","la","signifi","plane","land","appear","lax","return","signifi","shoot","fedex","cargo","plane"],"filtered2":["auteur","give","credit","befor","main","titl","credit","befor","start","shoot","show","auteur","roll","around","bed","lycra","bike","short","wo","surpris","observ","auteur","kind","bodi","never","see","spandex","kind","look","mai","us","homosexu","avers","therapistbr","give","thing","dish","deserv","pitiabl","moment","come","trip","la","signifi","plane","land","appear","lax","return","signifi","shoot","fedex","cargo","plane"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,16,28,29,30,34,42,46,56,71,79,98,117,122,169,179,188,264,272,326,356,376,406,423,488,766,795,870,1043,1065,1088,1855,2479,3541,4061,4501,6017,6936,8541],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,16,28,29,30,34,42,46,56,71,79,98,117,122,169,179,188,264,272,326,356,376,406,423,488,766,795,870,1043,1065,1088,1855,2479,3541,4061,4501,6017,6936,8541],"values":[0.6557002054693947,1.1966138720291084,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,2.6728839783437044,1.3982850089458962,1.6219954307453837,1.655771293751733,1.8610609350701788,1.9214926742550966,3.893901213901217,2.0881990796736947,4.5594602370234405,4.497869534746497,2.4214486257841834,2.507968722980095,2.5378812223426954,2.757740698455715,2.8028805344481915,2.942840385588056,6.056670924119444,3.1569204307489187,3.121829110937649,3.164467636384302,3.3933092088131493,3.9825254665248626,3.784589681929357,3.944626193933877,4.115443926246347,4.1302590120314875,9.027165988524876,4.838444069955973,5.3560264761848435,6.032366538428407,5.878215858601149,18.304078229746075,13.086384324388797,6.725513718988353,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.583241620204538E-5,7.532106049142329E-5,7.590660991441125E-5,7.546802071366558E-5,7.546925717221747E-5,7.536376623232996E-5,7.558790863254577E-5,7.53319062319715E-5,7.550127981891792E-5,8.376454850661736E-5,0.3112298268909415,7.521030392646236E-5,7.661406695268013E-5,7.770698345263091E-5,7.526514649549918E-5,7.505714610443863E-5,7.692935272522775E-5,7.559499064902318E-5,7.5360457485019E-5,7.54229179054129E-5,7.615267887257853E-5,7.566988615563182E-5,7.575604780062815E-5,7.583766644540216E-5,0.21742210473855322,0.18238343766890516,7.921576571989153E-5,7.523266326021915E-5,7.523467591014704E-5,7.542528253611212E-5,7.702842925916745E-5,7.559061056484058E-5,0.06937130310306017,7.580323579771076E-5,7.531455063087619E-5,7.566217692990062E-5,7.523908356904718E-5,7.528354433174444E-5,7.505676901126798E-5,7.507624219995368E-5,7.524522969690465E-5,7.603890743016971E-5,7.565252178756276E-5,7.53534128642471E-5,7.626903584342641E-5,7.538233391587121E-5,7.788691453782857E-5,7.674156475681655E-5,7.509490275040424E-5,7.526086707785111E-5,7.52347637736825E-5,7.735215283692579E-5,7.526198681607477E-5,7.506957714522081E-5,7.589357318723128E-5,7.528137230594069E-5,0.12601209901246097,7.521933067328982E-5,7.50940343209345E-5,7.545258629471831E-5,7.620101253741979E-5,7.54475946769535E-5,7.508014175670309E-5,7.52549543677112E-5,7.505767683617543E-5,7.679435590676872E-5,0.08797003613277421,7.554300232318943E-5,7.547693655345577E-5,7.575206198493321E-5,7.505493861308681E-5,7.54785188920738E-5,7.670273036249574E-5,7.518944123207654E-5,7.705034072638649E-5,7.538823447583803E-5,7.597826060085841E-5,7.551391489604466E-5,7.503140667928971E-5,7.512441326106936E-5]}}
