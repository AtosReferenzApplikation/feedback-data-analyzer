{"value":"In director Eric Stanze's 'ISOYC, IPOYG', three men are subjected to torture at the the hands of a woman that they have all sexually abused. The first victim is forced to eat his own crap, before being axed to death. The next bloke ends up with a bullet in the crotch after refusing to have anal sex with the first guy's corpse. But it's the third man who gets it the worst: he has to watch the heavily tattooed 'star' Emily Haack get naked and masturbate with a broom handle (oh, he also gets the handle shoved up his butt too!).<br /><br />And, unfortunately, so do we (get to see her masturbate, that isÂ—not get a broom handle up our butts!).<br /><br />Yes, 'ISOYC, IPOYG' is one harsh viewing experience, not because of its relentless violence, but because Haack, who is obviously under the misguided notion that she has the body of a goddess (as opposed to that of a roadie for Metallica) constantly gets buck naked for the camera. It ain't a pretty sight.<br /><br />In addition to the non-stop nudity from an inked-up Haack, viewers also get to see dreadful direction from Stanze (who thinks that endless shots of tombstones and trees is entertaining stuff), some really bad acting, and a fat guy's penis.<br /><br />Strangely enough, I give 'ISOYC, IPOYG' a rating of 3/10, which is actually slightly higher than its current 2.9 average. That's one point for the messy axe attack (which, being a gore-hound, I actually enjoyed); one point for the bit where the fat guy gets his face pushed in chocolate mousse masquerading as feces (hilarious); and one point for the sheer nerve to suggest that this film might somehow be a sequel to Meir Zarchi's superior exploitation classic I Spit On Your Grave.","finished_norm":["in","director","eric","stanz","isoyc","ipoyg","three","man","be","subject","to","tortur","at","the","the","hand","of","a","woman","that","thei","have","all","sexual","abus","the","victim","be","forc","to","eat","hi","own","crap","befor","be","ax","to","death","the","next","bloke","end","up","with","a","bullet","in","the","crotch","after","refus","to","have","anal","sex","with","the","gui","corps","but","it","the","man","who","get","it","the","wrong","he","have","to","watch","the","heavili","tattoo","star","emili","haack","get","nake","and","masturb","with","a","broom","handl","oh","he","conjur","get","the","handl","shove","up","hi","butt","toobr","br","and","unfortun","so","do","we","get","to","see","her","masturb","that","isnot","get","a","broom","handl","up","our","buttsbr","br","ye","isoyc","ipoyg","be","on","harsh","view","experi","not","becaus","of","it","relentless","violenc","but","becaus","haack","who","be","obvious","under","the","misguid","notion","that","she","have","the","bodi","of","a","goddess","a","oppos","to","that","of","a","roadi","for","metallica","constantli","get","buck","nake","for","the","camera","it","have","not","a","pretti","sightbr","br","in","addit","to","the","nonstop","nuditi","from","a","inkedup","haack","viewer","conjur","get","to","see","dread","direct","from","stanz","who","think","that","endless","shot","of","tombston","and","tree","be","entertain","stuff","some","realli","bad","act","and","a","fat","gui","penisbr","br","strang","enough","i","give","isoyc","ipoyg","a","rate","of","which","be","actual","slightli","high","than","it","current","averag","that","on","point","for","the","messi","ax","attack","which","be","a","gorehound","i","actual","enjoi","on","point","for","the","bite","where","the","fat","gui","get","hi","face","push","in","chocol","mouss","masquerad","a","fece","hilari","and","on","point","for","the","sheer","nerv","to","suggest","that","thi","film","mai","somehow","be","a","sequel","to","meir","zarchi","superior","exploit","classic","i","spit","on","your","grave"],"filtered":["director","eric","stanz","isoyc","ipoyg","three","man","subject","tortur","hand","woman","thei","sexual","abus","victim","forc","eat","hi","crap","befor","ax","death","next","bloke","end","bullet","crotch","refus","anal","sex","gui","corps","man","get","wrong","watch","heavili","tattoo","star","emili","haack","get","nake","masturb","broom","handl","oh","conjur","get","handl","shove","hi","butt","toobr","br","unfortun","get","see","masturb","isnot","get","broom","handl","buttsbr","br","ye","isoyc","ipoyg","harsh","view","experi","becaus","relentless","violenc","becaus","haack","obvious","misguid","notion","bodi","goddess","oppos","roadi","metallica","constantli","get","buck","nake","camera","pretti","sightbr","br","addit","nonstop","nuditi","inkedup","haack","viewer","conjur","get","see","dread","direct","stanz","think","endless","shot","tombston","tree","entertain","stuff","realli","bad","act","fat","gui","penisbr","br","strang","enough","give","isoyc","ipoyg","rate","actual","slightli","high","current","averag","point","messi","ax","attack","gorehound","actual","enjoi","point","bite","fat","gui","get","hi","face","push","chocol","mouss","masquerad","fece","hilari","point","sheer","nerv","suggest","thi","film","mai","somehow","sequel","meir","zarchi","superior","exploit","classic","spit","grave"],"filtered2":["director","eric","stanz","isoyc","ipoyg","three","man","subject","tortur","hand","woman","sexual","abus","victim","forc","eat","crap","befor","ax","death","next","bloke","end","bullet","crotch","refus","anal","sex","gui","corps","man","get","wrong","watch","heavili","tattoo","star","emili","haack","get","nake","masturb","broom","handl","oh","conjur","get","handl","shove","butt","toobr","unfortun","get","see","masturb","isnot","get","broom","handl","buttsbr","ye","isoyc","ipoyg","harsh","view","experi","becaus","relentless","violenc","becaus","haack","obvious","misguid","notion","bodi","goddess","oppos","roadi","metallica","constantli","get","buck","nake","camera","pretti","sightbr","addit","nonstop","nuditi","inkedup","haack","viewer","conjur","get","see","dread","direct","stanz","think","endless","shot","tombston","tree","entertain","stuff","realli","bad","act","fat","gui","penisbr","strang","enough","give","isoyc","ipoyg","rate","actual","slightli","high","current","averag","point","messi","ax","attack","gorehound","actual","enjoi","point","bite","fat","gui","get","face","push","chocol","mouss","masquerad","fece","hilari","point","sheer","nerv","suggest","mai","somehow","sequel","meir","zarchi","superior","exploit","classic","spit","grave"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,7,9,12,13,21,22,24,25,30,39,45,46,52,55,58,66,70,78,79,93,100,102,154,195,200,202,209,211,224,227,231,234,235,245,251,254,279,297,312,313,332,333,338,341,361,376,387,417,441,453,495,519,535,549,550,599,612,632,643,646,802,893,918,945,965,995,1151,1156,1184,1185,1256,

{"value":"You do realize that you've been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an Island, but you'd think that after watching unkempt, stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original (and interesting).<br /><br />And I'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record I find questionable. It's just hard to suspend disbelief for \"Bushy Bill\" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy.<br /><br />What's the appeal here? I don't care about these people or their meandering lives. I just don't get it. But if you DO find yourself being captivated by hairy, unwashed people, I suggest you turn off your TV and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their TRUE habitat. They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE, and free of charge, you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters, eventually striking \"pay-dirt\" and fashioning a homemade Dr. Frankenstein-styled cancer-stick, all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of \"Aqua Velva\" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part?

{"value":"this is a terrible, terrible film!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />first of all TOOO long. the longest movie i have ever seen.<br /><br />the stories are all too Damn Over the Top!!!!<br /><br />as a matter of fact there are too many stories that the Story line is Ruined.<br /><br />the comedy wasn't Comedy!!!!! it wasn't funny at all....<br /><br />the story is so repulsive and badly written that it doesnot matter if the characters live or die.......<br /><br />i had some expectations from this movie......... but my expectations were crashed completely in the first few minutes......<br /><br />the only thing good about this movie is the MUSIC...... and obviously Vidya Balan. she gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors...... she's just a new comer and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so Pathetic!!!!! Govinda and the Blonde who playes his love interest also help saving this Disastrous movie. Govinda perfectly fits in the role of the Taxi driver. and the Blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance....<br /><br />another Talented actress Ayesha Takiya is completely wasted in this movie!!!! so is priyanka!!!!!!!!! Akshay does his role well but it seemed too over the top!!!!! Anil and Juhi are also totally wasted......<br /><br />the only one not wasted is Salman Because he has No Talent what so ever to be wasted!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />all in all this is a very Impossible

{"value":"The school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion (set by them also) where his face is scarred by acid. Years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school (since closed) for a reunion. What they didn't know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them. Then a storm starts, they're locked in the school and Marty starts to take revenge.<br /><br />Pretty silly. The murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school--but that's about it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he's stripped, has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt) and are just uncomfortable to watch. Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible to view. Also this movie goes out of its way to have nudity. There is full frontal of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie) but one girl decides to take a bath alone...AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them! And then there's the couple that has to have sex. This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them. It ends with a twist which had me groaning and rolling my eyes then ANOTHER twist which had me wanting to throw something heavy at the TV! The acting is bearable--not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro is in this too. She's a very beautiful woman but not much of an actress.<br /><br />This gets a 3 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere.

{"value":"...am i missing something here??? \"unexpected plot developments\"? \"plot twisting with subversive glee\"? are these viewers watching the same Arquette vehicle to which i just subjected myself (in an now-obvious sub(un)conscious bout of sadomasochism)...I just joined this site simply to make sure that no one else ever rents this stinker...this movie was an embarrassment to every single person involved...quick question: did Sir Stevie read the script before he gave the thumbs-up to Kate C.? if so, then it must be the same Spielberg who greenlighted \"howard the duck\"...don't give me that, \"it was a hit play\" crap--i'm guessing Mssr. Reddin ain't too pleased ...the DVD cover promised \"surprising corners\" and a \"twisted story...\" Story!!Story?? It's crap like this that make old Bobby McKee and his wandering band of Structuralists sound like geniuses...Sundance??Berlin??Toronto?? I have a home video of my cat farting that evokes more interest than Arquette's negatively-dimensional portrayal of anguished loss...and, talk about deux ex machina for Mr. Stanley T.; thank god, just in the nick o time he thought to have Dave call the cops! and thank shiva that the cops had just caught the true killer...what!!! up until the credits i was still waiting for it to be some kind of grift against Arquette and his \"hidden millions\"...no, Mrs. Spielberg, you don't escape unscathed: what the hell was that kitchen scene with the \"athlete's foot in my crotch\" gag??? are you worse in this or \"just cause\"?? i dunno...hey film lovers: why don't you make it a blockbuster night and rent this along with \"jersey girl\" and \"white chicks\" and then commit sepukka (or is it seppuka)...and take E. Dunsky with you....","finished_norm":["be","i","miss","someth","here","unexpect","plot","develop","plot","twist","with","subvers","glee","be","thi","viewer","watch","the","same","arquett","vehicl","to","which","i","just","subject","myself","in","a","nowobvi","subunconsci","bout","of","sadomasochismi","just","join","thi","site","simpli","to","make","sure","that","no","on","els","ever","rent","thi","stinkerthi","movi","be","a","embarrass","to","everi","singl","person","involvedquick","question","do","sir","stevi","read","the","script","befor","he","give","the","thumbsup","to","kate","c","if","so","then","it","must","be","the","same","spielberg","who","greenlight","howard","the","duckdont","give","me","that","it","be","a","hit","plai","crapim","guess","mssr","reddin","have","not","too","pleas","the","dvd","cover","promis","surpris","corner","and","a","twist","stori","storystori","it","crap","like","thi","that","make","old","bobbi","mckee","and","hi","wander","band","of","structuralist","sound","like","geniusessundanceberlintoronto","i","have","a","home","video","of","my","cat","fart","that","evok","much","interest","than","arquett","negativelydimension","portray","of","anguish","lossand","talk","about","deux","ex","machina","for","mr","stanlei","t","thank","god","just","in","the","nick","o","time","he","think","to","have","dave","call","the","cop","and","thank","shiva","that","the","cop","have","just","catch","the","true","killerwhat","up","until","the","credit","i","be","still","wait","for","it","to","be","some","kind","of","grift","against","arquett","and","hi","hide","millionsno","mr","spielberg","you","do","not","escap","unscath","what","the","hell","be","that","kitchen","scene","with","the","athlet","foot","in","my","crotch","gag","be","you","wrong","in","thi","or","just","caus","i","dunnohei","film","lover","why","do","not","you","make","it","a","blockbust","night","and","rend","thi","along","with","jersei","girl","and","white","chick","and","then","commit","sepukka","or","be","it","seppukaand","take","e","dunski","with","you"],"filtered":["miss","someth","unexpect","plot","develop","plot","twist","subvers","glee","thi","viewer","watch","arquett","vehicl","subject","nowobvi","subunconsci","bout","sadomasochismi","join","thi","site","simpli","make","sure","els","ever","rent","thi","stinkerthi","movi","embarrass","everi","singl","person","involvedquick","question","sir","stevi","read","script","befor","give","thumbsup","kate","c","must","spielberg","greenlight","howard","duckdont","give","hit","plai","crapim","guess","mssr","reddin","pleas","dvd","cover","promis","surpris","corner","twist","stori","storystori","crap","like","thi","make","old","bobbi","mckee","hi","wander","band","structuralist","sound","like","geniusessundanceberlintoronto","home","video","cat","fart","evok","much","interest","arquett","negativelydimension","portray","anguish","lossand","talk","deux","ex","machina","mr","stanlei","thank","god","nick","o","time","think","dave","call","cop","thank","shiva","cop","catch","true","killerwhat","credit","still","wait","kind","grift","arquett","hi","hide","millionsno","mr","spielberg","escap","unscath","hell","kitchen","scene","athlet","foot","crotch","gag","wrong","thi","caus","dunnohei","film","lover","make","blockbust","night","rend","thi","along","jersei","girl","white","chick","commit","sepukka","seppukaand","take","e","dunski"],"filtered2":["miss","someth","unexpect","plot","develop","plot","twist","subvers","glee","viewer","watch","arquett","vehicl","subject","nowobvi","subunconsci","bout","sadomasochismi","join","site","simpli","make","sure","els","ever","rent","stinkerthi","embarrass","everi","singl","person","involvedquick","question","sir","stevi","read","script","befor","give","thumbsup","kate","c","must","spielberg","greenlight","howard","duckdont","give","hit","plai","crapim","guess","mssr","reddin","pleas","dvd","cover","promis","surpris","corner","twist","stori","storystori","crap","like","make","old","bobbi","mckee","wander","band","structuralist","sound","like","geniusessundanceberlintoronto","home","video","cat","fart","evok","interest","arquett","negativelydimension","portray","anguish","lossand","talk","deux","ex","machina","mr","stanlei","thank","god","nick","o","time","think","dave","call","cop","thank","shiva","cop","catch","true","killerwhat","credit","still","wait","kind","grift","arquett","hide","millionsno","mr","spielberg","escap","unscath","hell","kitchen","scene","athlet","foot","crotch","gag","wrong","caus","dunnohei","lover","make","blockbust","night","rend","along","jersei","girl","white","chick","commit","sepukka","seppukaand","take","e","dunski"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,8,12,17,19,25,30,31,32,40,44,53,60,64,67,77,79,84,85,119,122,141,142,145,153,178,186,196,201,210,240,243,247,255,279,302,304,313,320,324,326,331,346,352,356,357,359,378,388,394,435,443,452,476,491,512,533,550,556,638,651,661,683,707,792,927,954,969,981,994,998,1041,1115,1242,1319,14

{"value":"You do realize that you've been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an Island, but you'd think that after watching unkempt, stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original (and interesting).<br /><br />And I'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record I find questionable. It's just hard to suspend disbelief for \"Bushy Bill\" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy.<br /><br />What's the appeal here? I don't care about these people or their meandering lives. I just don't get it. But if you DO find yourself being captivated by hairy, unwashed people, I suggest you turn off your TV and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their TRUE habitat. They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE, and free of charge, you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters, eventually striking \"pay-dirt\" and fashioning a homemade Dr. Frankenstein-styled cancer-stick, all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of \"Aqua Velva\" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part?

{"value":"You do realize that you've been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years, right? I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co-exist on an Island, but you'd think that after watching unkempt, stink-ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original (and interesting).<br /><br />And I'm not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record I find questionable. It's just hard to suspend disbelief for \"Bushy Bill\" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy.<br /><br />What's the appeal here? I don't care about these people or their meandering lives. I just don't get it. But if you DO find yourself being captivated by hairy, unwashed people, I suggest you turn off your TV and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their TRUE habitat. They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE, and free of charge, you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters, eventually striking \"pay-dirt\" and fashioning a homemade Dr. Frankenstein-styled cancer-stick, all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of \"Aqua Velva\" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise. And the best part?

{"value":"Seriously, I'm all for gooey romantic comedies and will get sucked into Miss Congeniality as easily as Goodfellas...but this movie? It doesn't make any sense!!!! And I'm not even talking about the willing suspension of disbelief kind of not making sense. Why does her family live in England? Or, at the very least, why doesn't she have a British accent? She's sure cozy with her dad and he's surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years. (On that subject, no one ever makes much of a deal about her being away for so long). And what was with the goofy outfits at the bachelorette party? I'm not even going to get into the fact that the escort she paid for falls in love with her--that could've been overcome by better movie-making. I'm just saying that the characters, the setting, and the plot aren't fleshed out enough to make an even somewhat cohesive story. Oh, and the worst part, in my opinion, is the filmmaker's consistent use of the most unflattering angles on Deborah Messing's nose--I'd have sued the filmmakers if I were her! I mean, honestly, I'm all for women being who they are, but why, in seven loyal years of Will and Grace viewing, have I not ever noticed how incredibly odd her nose is? Oh! Because those producers are kind to her! This movie, like my other least favorite movie ever, Armageddon, is the fault of the filmmakers, not the actors. I can see both Messing and McDermott in these roles with a better writer, director, and producer.<br /><br />This easily gets my vote as one of the worst movies I've ever wasted time on. I'm just glad a friend loaned me her DVD, so all I wasted was time.

{"value":"((NB: Spoiler warning, such as it is!))<br /><br />First off, this is a teen slasher flick -- the Spam-In-A-Cabin genre, as Joe Bob Briggs piquantly put it. If you're looking for Roshambo, this isn't it and wasn't going to BE it. I'm desperately unimpressed by stabs at its cinematography, directing or acting performances.<br /><br />Secondly, this wasn't Zuniga's first horror flick, it was her first screen appearance period, cinema, TV, whatever. For what it is worth; neither is Daphne Zuniga Susan Sarandon or Katherine Hepburn.<br /><br />Thirdly, you have to give even a lame slasher flick props. Sure, it follows the deeply insulting formulaic message of its genre: any young woman having or showing interest in sex is beef on the hoof, and the harvest time is now.<br /><br />Except this one gives the chop to the sweet, virginal protagonist as well! Now THERE is a mediocre teen death film that has the courage of its convictions! Interesting that this was said ingenue's only film role. Another One Hit Wonder, except that term gives the lass too much credit.<br /><br />(Then again, this film probably has one of the highest percentage of one-movie actors in history. Of the nineteen credited actors, a whopping thirteen never appeared in any other film. Three appeared in one other movie by the same producers. Only one other besides Zuniga has as many as six screen credits. What was this, the Has Been And Never Were Mutual Aid Society?)<br /><br />Granted, I saw this a long time ago on late night cable when I was bored and never anticipate being that bored in my life again, but I see no reason to hunt down everyone involved and toss them in the incinerator with Joanne.<br /><br

{"value":"John Scott (John Wayne) and partner Kansas Charlie (Eddy Chandler) are trail buddies who make their way to the Rattlesnake Gulch rodeo. Scott is a pretty fair contestant, but finds that unless he's willing to accept twenty five cents on the dollar in prize money from a crooked promoter, he'll have to collect his winnings at gunpoint. Quite coincidentally, bandits Pete (Al Ferguson) and Jim (Paul Fix) decide they'd like the rest of the rodeo take; they shoot promoter Farnsworth (Henry Hall), and make it look like Scott and Kansas Charlie are the killers. <br /><br />Wayne and Chandler use a running gag in the film where they're about to go at it with their fists over various trivialities. Each time Chandler takes a wild swing, Wayne foot stomps him and knocks him silly.<br /><br />If you're very attentive, there's a neat Lipton's Tea ad in one of the scenes in which Scott's love interest Anne (Mary Kornman) appears.<br /><br />Later on in the film, the buddies are framed once again over a stage robbery. Having a change of heart and seeing the error of his ways, bad guy Jim wants to come clean and confess to the sheriff, but Pete shoots him down. While being patched up, Jim tells his story to the doctor and his sister Anne. In an unbelievable scene, Anne marches right into the middle of a gunfight between the good guys and the villains to confront the sheriff.<br /><br />\"The Desert Trail\" is one of the blander John Wayne Westerns from Lone Star Productions during this era.

{"value":"Well, it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but I feel I must say something. I wasn't exactly looking for 'a splatterfest' as someone puts it or even 'blood and guts/gore'. I have some respect for the victims relatives although I really felt the filmaker DIDN'T. -They were nameless, faceless and meaningless. Just a vessel for Dahmers sexual antics.<br /><br />I watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think 'What makes a guy be a serial killer?' as well as wondering the specifics about the Dahmer story, of which I know very little. People here seem to think that the movie didn't have to cover the events of the Dahmer story.. I.E. his history, what happened when he got caught, the aftermath, etc but IT IS IMPORTANT! You see, I assume if you are American you WILL KNOW all of this. We do not all live in America. To tell this story about such a man as he obviously was, REQUIRES that at least SOME of the history and actual events are told/shown. This doesn't mean blood and guts, there are ways of showing horrific things in a movie by implication or clever filming without resorting to gore. Without even touching upon some of what he did (I found out more about him reading the user comments on this site!), the movie felt like a void. A moment in time with very little substance. I would like to know if there is a film about the REAL Dahmer because with its lack of direction, VERY slow pace that NEVER changes, Strange portrayal of homosexuality and the VERY unfortunate lack of ANY attempt at an ending, this movie is POOR.

{"value":"When I look back on my college days at Ohio University, there will always be one event in which I will remember with fond memories. Channel 23 is OU's local access channel and until the last few years, pretty much played anything they were sent. This included many DIY movies ranging from a guy microwaving marshmallow Peeps and then scanning pictures of them online, to a version of Macbeth starring 8th graders who had apparently just learned how to make squibs.<br /><br />However, the king, in my opinion, of the channel 23 lineup was Midnight Skater. The first time I watched it was around 2AM. I should have been studying. Or sleeping. Or watching regular TV. But no, all that is for pussies. My roommate and I watched Midnight Skater, and when it was complete, I don't think either of us believed that any of the movie had just happened. But sure enough, it was on a few nights later, and we had to come to grips that this movie did, in fact, exist.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how awful it is, but its the sort of awful that makes life worth living. The plot is disjointed, the acting terrible, the everything soul scarring, but by god, if there are others watching with you, its impossible not to have a good time watching it. Its sort of like the first time you hear \"Guts\" by Chuck Pahalniuk. You hear it, you're disgusted and shaken, but five minutes later, all you want and desire is to make someone else experience the abject horror you just endured.<br /><br />Long story short, Midnight Skater, for all of its epic flaws, makes for some very late night fun. Plus, I desperately want the Theme to Midnight Skater. Kudos to whoever wrote it and sang it.

{"value":"Private Practice is supposed to be a medical drama. So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines. Just by watching House, I \"solved\" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before the doctors did. Boooring. Seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases out of older ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap? House is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with...<br /><br />Second biggest complaint: these people are supposed to be forty-somethings, right? Then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year-olds? Is three weeks (ie. three whole damn episodes) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your \"friend with benefits\", it's maybe not because he wants to hurt you, but because he doesn't want to risk your friendship? The character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed \"drama\".<br /><br />And I won't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite Addison as we got to know her in Grey's Anatomy... On a sidenote, don't you think it's funny the way Addison ends up lusting after loser Pete (sorry, but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, PhD or not) and Derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny, irritating Meredith miles away in rainy Seattle? Apart from that little fling with Mark, they seemed to be perfect for each other. Sometimes I think Shonda Rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships, our first choice is often the right

{"value":"The same difficulty I have with the musical version of \"Les Miserables\" applies equally to \"Oliver.\" Instead of the composers' writing in the stylistic period of the play settings, they merely wrote Broadway-type melodies, which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed.<br /><br />Too, the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score. It's a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste.<br /><br />The casting of the boy Oliver doesn't help matters: tentative of timbre and vexingly precious, there's something less than solid here. Fagin performs his traditional routine adequately, though the tunes he's obliged to sing have little basis in period manner.<br /><br />\"As Long As He Needs Me\" is given a strident rendition, throaty and strained. The two big production numbers, \"Who Will Buy\" and \"Consider Yourself\" seem over-produced, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. It's one thing to go all out, yet another to cross over the line into excess. <br /><br />The gloom, despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography. While the novel is considered a classic, I must confess I have trouble with Mr. Dickens' consciousness, in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration. This may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret. <br /><br />Not all the combined talent of this production, either on- or behind camera, can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material.

{"value":"In one word... abysmal. I give it one star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women, otherwise forget it. Corman's worst effort, bar none. Ben Vereen should have had his name permanently stricken from the cast. I cannot believe that this is now going to be on DVD (as of 2/15/05) with \"Wild In The Streets\" - another retro stinker. I woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold, decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some, scanned the digital channels... the premise looked interesting enough because I like viewing B-movie sci-fi, hippie culture and rebellious teen flicks. It seemed familiar somehow and with Ben Vereen in the cast, I thought... why not? What a big mistake... it was a horrible start to my day.<br /><br />Only after viewing it, I now know why the familiarity crept into the recesses of my newly-awakened brain. I remembered seeing coming attractions for this film as a 14-year old (I'm 45), back in the early/mid-seventies at the Sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even groaned out loud at how bad this movie looked. Acting: dreadful, story: awful, cinematography: nearly-awful, music: terrible, sound: horrendous, directing: a joke. If you choose to watch this after my warning, remember... \"I told you so.\"<br /><br />\"Gass-s-s-s\" is the perfect title for this film... you feel \"gassed\" after viewing this putrid movie - or maybe that you should be taken to a \"gas\" chamber for wasting your brain away. I have seen homemade Super 8 movies that put this film to shame.

{"value":"Except people apparently buy into this garbage! As shows like \"Moral Orel\" have shown, even if you tried to make the most outrageous, over-the-top parody of evangelism you could possibly think of, it wouldn't come close to the hilarity of this show. It's hard to tell what's even going on when you're watching it. Is it a news show? A talk show? Who knows!? They start out by reporting on various international news stories, but at seemingly random points, the news is interrupted by this odd, troll-like little man with a forehead bigger than his entire face, mumbling and laughing and generally being creepy.<br /><br />Pat Robertson doesn't even seem like such a bad guy at first glance. He just seems like a senile, yet harmless old coot stuck in his archaic beliefs (like most of our grandparents). But this is a man who has called for an assassination, who has befriended and offered aid to not one, but TWO murderous dictators, who has illegally used donation money to run diamond mines, who has SUPPORTED forced abortions in China, and who regularly implies that Caucasians (straight American male Caucasians in particular) are superior to all other races.<br /><br />Still, this would all be funny, except that he apparently has a large enough fan base to keep his little show on the air 40 years later (either that, or enough money to bribe some TV executives who don't give a damn what they show). The idiocy of the show becomes alarming when you realize that some people, somewhere, must be watching it and hanging onto every word. Even when Robertson has repeatedly shown how corrupt he is, people still listen to him. I don't know if it's funny or scary.

{"value":"Thanks to some infamous home video distributor who brought in the so called German Independent Series, Four For Venice is not only awful, but really awful. So awful, that i have it dumped at the second hand goods store for extra cash.<br /><br />Nick and Charlotte is a married couple who reached an agreement of having sex only on Tuesday due to their hectic schedule of their profession. Eva and Luis is a pair of couple living from hand to mouth, where Eva works as a waitress and Luis, an artist. Nick indirectly causes Eva to lose her job as an waitress. Luis and Charlotte had an affair at the back of Eva and Nick. Luis cheated on Eva by lying to her that he would be flying off to London to do something related to his artwork, but the fact is, he is flying off to Venice with Charlotte for an adultery holiday. Eva kidnapped Nick and dragged her 2 kids along to Venice for confrontation. The trip to Venice ends up both Nick and Eva falling for one another.<br /><br />The presentation of the journey from Germany to Venice between Nick and Eva marks the failure of the comedy. It not only look senseless, but also draggy. In the film, Nick try to seek help for several ways, but it ends to no avail. It is either the strangers around him who acts like morons, or they are just simply dumb.<br /><br />The comedy also had the tendency to add in unnecessary scenes to lengthen the story. While some of the problems that can be solved with common sense, no one in the film are using common sense to solve the problem. They prefer to go through one big round to solve the problem.<br /><br />It fails so bad, that even the beautiful sceneries in Venice fails to pull up the reputation of the film.","finished_norm":["thank","to","some","infam","home","video","distributor","who","bring","in","the","so","call","german","independ","seri","four","for","venic","be","not","onli","aw","but","realli","aw","so","aw","that","i","have","it","dump","at","the","hand","good","store","for","extra","cashbr","br","nick","and","charlott","be","a","marri","coupl","who","reach","a","agreem","of","have","sex","onli","on","tuesdai","due","to","their","hectic","schedul","of","their","profess","eva","and","lui","be","a","pair","of","coupl","live","from","hand","to","mouth","where","eva","work","a","a","waitress","and","lui","a","artist","nick","indirectli","caus","eva","to","lose","her","job","a","a","waitress","lui","and","charlott","have","a","affair","at","the","back","of","eva","and","nick","lui","cheat","on","eva","by","lie","to","her","that","he","would","be","fly","off","to","london","to","do","someth","relat","to","hi","artwork","but","the","fact","be","he","be","fly","off","to","venic","with","charlott","for","a","adulteri","holidai","eva","kidnap","nick","and","drag","her","kid","along","to","venic","for","confront","the","trip","to","venic","end","up","both","nick","and","eva","fall","for","on","anotherbr","br","the","present","of","the","journei","from","germani","to","venic","between","nick","and","eva","mark","the","failur","of","the","comedi","it","not","onli","look","senseless","but","conjur","draggi","in","the","film","nick","try","to","seek","help","for","sever","wai","but","it","end","to","no","avail","it","be","either","the","stranger","around","him","who","act","like","moron","or","thei","be","just","simpli","dumbbr","br","the","comedi","conjur","have","the","tendenc","to","add","in","unnecessari","scene","to","lengthen","the","stori","while","some","of","the","problem","that","can","be","solv","with","common","sens","no","on","in","the","film","be","us","common","sens","to","solv","the","problem","thei","prefer","to","go","through","on","big","round","to","solv","the","problembr","br","it","fail","so","bad","that","even","the","beauti","sceneri","in","venic","fail","to","pull","up","the","reput","of","the","film"],"filtered":["thank","infam","home","video","distributor","bring","call","german","independ","seri","four","venic","onli","aw","realli","aw","aw","dump","hand","good","store","extra","cashbr","br","nick","charlott","marri","coupl","reach","agreem","sex","onli","tuesdai","due","hectic","schedul","profess","eva","lui","pair","coupl","live","hand","mouth","eva","work","waitress","lui","artist","nick","indirectli","caus","eva","lose","job","waitress","lui","charlott","affair","back","eva","nick","lui","cheat","eva","lie","fly","london","someth","relat","hi","artwork","fact","fly","venic","charlott","adulteri","holidai","eva","kidnap","nick","drag","kid","along","venic","confront","trip","venic","end","nick","eva","fall","anotherbr","br","present","journei","germani","venic","nick","eva","mark","failur","comedi","onli","look","senseless","conjur","draggi","film","nick","try","seek","help","sever","wai","end","avail","either","stranger","around","act","like","moron","thei","simpli","dumbbr","br","comedi","conjur","tendenc","add","unnecessari","scene","lengthen","stori","problem","solv","common","sens","film","us","common","sens","solv","problem","thei","prefer","go","big","round","solv","problembr","br","fail","bad","even","beauti","sceneri","venic","fail","pull","reput","film"],"filtered2":["thank","infam","home","video","distributor","bring","call","german","independ","four","venic","onli","aw","realli","aw","aw","dump","hand","good","store","extra","cashbr","nick","charlott","marri","coupl","reach","agreem","sex","onli","tuesdai","due","hectic","schedul","profess","eva","lui","pair","coupl","live","hand","mouth","eva","work","waitress","lui","artist","nick","indirectli","caus","eva","lose","job","waitress","lui","charlott","affair","back","eva","nick","lui","cheat","eva","lie","fly","london","someth","relat","artwork","fact","fly","venic","charlott","adulteri","holidai","eva","kidnap","nick","drag","kid","along","venic","confront","trip","venic","end","nick","eva","fall","anotherbr","present","journei","germani","venic","nick","eva","mark","failur","comedi","onli","look","senseless","conjur","draggi","nick","try","seek","help","sever","wai","end","avail","either","stranger","around","act","like","moron","simpli","dumbbr","comedi","conjur","tendenc","add","unnecessari","scene","lengthen","stori","problem","solv","common","sens","us","common","sens","solv","problem","prefer","go","big","round","solv","problembr","fail","bad","even","beauti","sceneri","venic","fail","pull","reput"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,3,5,6,9,11,13,16,17,19,21,24,33,36,39,48,53,56,63,82,97,98,114,116,127,138,142,167,169,173,185,201,207,215,221,235,240,250,253,254,289,299,302,316,324,325,411,452,544,568,606,650,651,652,717,724,733,764,793,903,924,934,939,941,1001,1042,1081,1092,1138,1201,1211,1238,1268,

{"value":"There aren't many good things to say at all about Underneath, Soderbergh's untrue endeavor into neo-noir. Soderbergh remakes Robert Siodmak's decent noir Criss-Cross faithfully, not altering the plot very much at all, however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its state-of-the-art film noir atmosphere, giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places, lifestyles and anachronisms. Soderbergh, who would later make wonderful crime films like Out of Sight and the Ocean's series with great style and atmosphere, takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest, dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s. Nightclubs have terrible, revoltingly dressed garage bands, Peter Gallagher's uninteresting version of Burt Lancaster's anti-hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos, TVs, and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film.<br /><br />It could've been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score, more flesh to its characters, more than just William Fichtner giving performances that aren't wooden, a crisper pace. Unfortunately, Underneath has none of these things. Soderbergh, a fine director, does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time. That disposition works wonderfully when he's helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the George Clooney pictures previously mentioned, or a social or character drama like Traffic or sex, lies and videotape. With a movie like Underneath, it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer.","finished_norm":["there","be","not","mani","good","thing","to","sai","at","all","about","underneath","soderbergh","untru","endeavor","into","neonoir","soderbergh","remak","robert","siodmak","decent","noir","crisscross","faithfulli","not","alter","the","plot","veri","much","at","all","howev","the","adapt","drain","it","of","everi","ounc","of","it","stateoftheart","film","noir","atmospher","give","it","the","same","stori","set","in","the","veri","littl","appeal","place","lifestyl","and","anachron","soderbergh","who","would","late","make","wonder","crime","film","like","out","of","sight","and","the","ocean","seri","with","great","styl","and","atmospher","take","the","danger","obviou","rout","to","modern","by","renov","the","stori","with","the","ugli","dull","and","flat","fashion","of","the","earli","nightclub","have","terribl","revoltingli","dress","garag","band","peter","gallagh","uninterest","version","of","burt","lancast","antihero","be","leav","by","hi","femm","fatal","girlfriend","for","compuls","bui","cinemat","lifeless","modern","applianc","like","stereo","tv","and","other","up","to","date","piec","of","equip","that","suck","the","reaction","out","of","the","filmbr","br","it","can","have","be","much","entertain","and","littl","bore","have","it","a","few","save","grace","like","a","good","score","much","flesh","to","it","charact","much","than","just","william","fichtner","give","perform","that","be","not","wooden","a","crisp","pace","unfortun","underneath","have","none","of","thi","thing","soderbergh","a","fine","director","doe","not","util","hi","spindri","detach","to","the","benefit","of","hi","film","thi","time","that","disposit","work","wonderfulli","when","he","helm","a","crime","movi","with","much","tongu","in","it","cheek","like","the","georg","cloonei","pictur","previous","mention","or","a","social","or","charact","drama","like","traffic","or","sex","lie","and","videotap","with","a","movi","like","underneath","it","intensifi","the","boredom","experi","by","the","viewer"],"filtered":["mani","good","thing","sai","underneath","soderbergh","untru","endeavor","neonoir","soderbergh","remak","robert","siodmak","decent","noir","crisscross","faithfulli","alter","plot","veri","much","howev","adapt","drain","everi","ounc","stateoftheart","film","noir","atmospher","give","stori","set","veri","littl","appeal","place","lifestyl","anachron","soderbergh","late","make","wonder","crime","film","like","sight","ocean","seri","great","styl","atmospher","take","danger","obviou","rout","modern","renov","stori","ugli","dull","flat","fashion","earli","nightclub","terribl","revoltingli","dress","garag","band","peter","gallagh","uninterest","version","burt","lancast","antihero","leav","hi","femm","fatal","girlfriend","compuls","bui","cinemat","lifeless","modern","applianc","like","stereo","tv","date","piec","equip","suck","reaction","filmbr","br","much","entertain","littl","bore","save","grace","like","good","score","much","flesh","charact","much","william","fichtner","give","perform","wooden","crisp","pace","unfortun","underneath","none","thi","thing","soderbergh","fine","director","doe","util","hi","spindri","detach","benefit","hi","film","thi","time","disposit","work","wonderfulli","helm","crime","movi","much","tongu","cheek","like","georg","cloonei","pictur","previous","mention","social","charact","drama","like","traffic","sex","lie","videotap","movi","like","underneath","intensifi","boredom","experi","viewer"],"filtered2":["mani","good","thing","underneath","soderbergh","untru","endeavor","neonoir","soderbergh","remak","robert","siodmak","decent","noir","crisscross","faithfulli","alter","plot","veri","howev","adapt","drain","everi","ounc","stateoftheart","noir","atmospher","give","stori","set","veri","littl","appeal","place","lifestyl","anachron","soderbergh","late","make","wonder","crime","like","sight","ocean","great","styl","atmospher","take","danger","obviou","rout","modern","renov","stori","ugli","dull","flat","fashion","earli","nightclub","terribl","revoltingli","dress","garag","band","peter","gallagh","uninterest","version","burt","lancast","antihero","leav","femm","fatal","girlfriend","compuls","bui","cinemat","lifeless","modern","applianc","like","stereo","tv","date","piec","equip","suck","reaction","filmbr","entertain","littl","bore","save","grace","like","good","score","flesh","charact","william","fichtner","give","perform","wooden","crisp","pace","unfortun","underneath","none","thing","soderbergh","fine","director","doe","util","spindri","detach","benefit","time","disposit","work","wonderfulli","helm","crime","tongu","cheek","like","georg","cloonei","pictur","previous","mention","social","charact","drama","like","traffic","sex","lie","videotap","like","underneath","intensifi","boredom","experi","viewer"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,8,10,14,15,17,18,29,30,31,32,48,50,51,58,74,85,105,108,109,113,150,164,166,172,175,189,195,218,220,227,254,266,279,285,309,311,333,347,367,370,380

{"value":"OK let's get right to the point. We have five recent college grads (must have majored in the F word) going out on a weekend camping trip. They run into someone who is in need of help, but instead of trying to assist him, they decide to set him on fire instead. Nice bunch of people. Next some of them start go get sick - must be something in the water at the cabin they are staying at. However the neighbors seem to be OK. Oh well, when things start getting really bad, they lock up one their companions instead of getting help (try the neighbor by the way). Some locals don't take a liking to them. They chase one on a high speed romp through the woods for many miles, until the truck breaks down. Somehow ten minutes later he shows up at the cabin (how he could find it and how he could travel at the speed of light to get there is a mystery). Another of the brain surgeon type at the cabin realizes something is amiss so he hides out in a cave to let this blow over. He then decides the next day to return to the cabin believing it must be some type of shrine. He is giddy with relief that he survived (he must have thought it was a 24 hour bug). Unfortuneatley he is met by some not so friendly police officers. Another couple decide to have sex while the flesh eating bug is working its magic, and then the women realizes she needs to shave her legs (taking a lot of the diseased skin with shaving cream). Anyway you get the idea. Nothing makes sense here. These are five people I would not want to be friends with. I was rooting for the flesh eating bacteria. Other characters were introduced who were also somewhat amusing but utterly unlikeable as well.

{"value":"A good idea, badly implemented. While that could summarize 99% of the SciFi channel's movies, it really applies here. I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed, and I like action movies, and I like all of the main actors, so this could have been great. However, despite some good acting, this movie fails due to Bill Platt's bad writing and directing.<br /><br />Another review made the good point of needing to know where you're going so you can get there. This movie doesn't. It's put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words \"second draft\" are not in Bill Platt's vocabulary. There is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing. This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car, so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle.<br /><br />This movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others, some to the point where you can guess the entire \"plot\" up front. It also had a habit of aborting a fight early, probably just because they couldn't afford it. There are also a few laughably bad scenes where the \"plot\" is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed \"toxic adhesive\" (seriously, what *is* that?).<br /><br />If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby, watch this movie because she's OK. She does manage to break out of her \"Roswell\" persona a few times and make for a good tough chick (but not always). John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he's ever done since playing Q back in ST:TNG, so that's nothing new.<br /><br />In all, I gave this movie a 4/10 rating.","finished_norm":["a","good","idea","badli","implem","while","that","can","summar","of","the","scifi","channel","movi","it","realli","appli","here","i","love","movi","where","a","good","back","stori","be","slowli","reveal","and","i","like","action","movi","and","i","like","all","of","the","main","actor","so","thi","can","have","be","great","howev","despit","some","good","act","thi","movi","fail","due","to","bill","platt","bad","write","and","directingbr","br","anoth","review","make","the","good","point","of","ne","to","know","where","you","re","go","so","you","can","get","there","thi","movi","doe","not","it","put","togeth","in","such","a","haphazard","wai","that","you","know","the","word","draft","be","not","in","bill","platt","vocabulari","there","be","on","scene","that","be","entir","unnecessari","and","can","be","remov","without","anyon","notic","thi","scene","even","begin","and","end","with","them","drive","a","car","so","you","can","cut","from","on","car","scene","to","the","other","and","never","have","miss","the","pointless","scene","in","the","middlebr","br","thi","movi","conjur","have","a","strang","habit","of","under","explain","some","detail","while","over","explain","other","some","to","the","point","where","you","can","guess","the","entir","plot","up","front","it","conjur","have","a","habit","of","abort","a","fight","earli","probabl","just","becaus","thei","can","not","afford","it","there","be","conjur","a","few","laughabl","bad","scene","where","the","plot","be","reveal","on","a","comput","and","the","final","battl","involv","conveni","place","toxic","adhes","serious","what","be","thatbr","br","if","you","be","a","fan","of","shiri","applebi","watch","thi","movi","becaus","she","okai","she","doe","manag","to","break","out","of","her","roswel","persona","a","few","time","and","make","for","a","good","tough","chick","but","not","alwai","john","de","lanci","plai","the","same","charact","he","plai","in","everyth","he","ever","do","sinc","plai","q","back","in","sttng","so","that","noth","newbr","br","in","all","i","give","thi","movi","a","rate"],"filtered":["good","idea","badli","implem","summar","scifi","channel","movi","realli","appli","love","movi","good","back","stori","slowli","reveal","like","action","movi","like","main","actor","thi","great","howev","despit","good","act","thi","movi","fail","due","bill","platt","bad","write","directingbr","br","anoth","review","make","good","point","ne","know","re","go","get","thi","movi","doe","put","togeth","haphazard","wai","know","word","draft","bill","platt","vocabulari","scene","entir","unnecessari","remov","without","anyon","notic","thi","scene","even","begin","end","drive","car","cut","car","scene","never","miss","pointless","scene","middlebr","br","thi","movi","conjur","strang","habit","explain","detail","explain","point","guess","entir","plot","front","conjur","habit","abort","fight","earli","probabl","becaus","thei","afford","conjur","laughabl","bad","scene","plot","reveal","comput","final","battl","involv","conveni","place","toxic","adhes","serious","thatbr","br","fan","shiri","applebi","watch","thi","movi","becaus","okai","doe","manag","break","roswel","persona","time","make","good","tough","chick","alwai","john","de","lanci","plai","charact","plai","everyth","ever","sinc","plai","q","back","sttng","noth","newbr","br","give","thi","movi","rate"],"filtered2":["good","idea","badli","implem","summar","scifi","channel","realli","appli","love","good","back","stori","slowli","reveal","like","action","like","main","actor","great","howev","despit","good","act","fail","due","bill","platt","bad","write","directingbr","anoth","review","make","good","point","ne","know","re","go","get","doe","put","togeth","haphazard","wai","know","word","draft","bill","platt","vocabulari","scene","entir","unnecessari","remov","without","anyon","notic","scene","even","begin","end","drive","car","cut","car","scene","never","miss","pointless","scene","middlebr","conjur","strang","habit","explain","detail","explain","point","guess","entir","plot","front","conjur","habit","abort","fight","earli","probabl","becaus","afford","conjur","laughabl","bad","scene","plot","reveal","comput","final","battl","involv","conveni","place","toxic","adhes","serious","thatbr","fan","shiri","applebi","watch","becaus","okai","doe","manag","break","roswel","persona","time","make","good","tough","chick","alwai","john","de","lanci","plai","charact","plai","everyth","ever","sinc","plai","q","back","sttng","noth","newbr","give","rate"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,13,17,18,19,21,22,24,26,30,32,33,39,40,41,42,44,49,51,54,63,65,66,68,73,110,113,123,125,129,140,147,148,156,158,159,162,164,176,179,191,193,197,198,202,215,233,241,243,255,258,266,270,284,291,303,345,360,371,391,395,417,448,461,531,552,568,688,722,728,740,750,765,773,781,786,833,1041,1081,1109,1375,1527,1600,2193,2352,2663,2707,2945,3358,4047,4244,4298,5564,5577,5879],"values":[2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,

{"value":"In a college dorm a guy is killed by somebody with a scythe. His girlfriend Beth (Dorie Barton) discovers him and tries to commit suicide. She's institutionalized. A year later she's out, has a new boyfriend named Hank (Joseph Lawrence) and is about to spend Spring Break with Hank and four other mindless friends in a BIG, beautiful condo in Florida. Naturally the killer pops up (for no reason) and starts killing again.<br /><br />Lousy slasher thriller--a textbook example of how NOT to do a low-budget horror movie. For starters, large portions of this film are ENDLESS filler of these six idiots videotaping themselves, having \"fun\" (more fun than the audience), getting drunk, acting stupid etc etc. Also there is NO nudity in here at all. I'm not saying a horror film needs nudity but ANYTHING to liven this up would have helped. None of the deaths are really shown (you hear them), are only a little bloody and there is no gore. There's one REAL gruesome one--but that's not till the end.<br /><br />With a few exceptions the acting sucks. Dorie Barton is dreadful as the main woman and Tom Jay Jones is lousy as Oz. Chad Allen pops up as Brad and he's TERRIBLE. Lawrence is actually very good--handsome and hunky and giving this crap his all. And Jeff Conaway pops up in a small role doing a pretty good job.<br /><br />Logic lapses abound--after they realize a friend has been killed two of the girls casually talk about sex; Baston's non reaction to seeing a friend getting killed is kind of funny and WHAT happens to Lawrence?

{"value":"This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and I really think that this film might just be the worst of them all--yet it wasn't just a nominee but it won!! I assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre.<br /><br />The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super-skinny Uncle Festers. The appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation. All are identical--with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs. They are all standing on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space. Each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform. The platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform. This goes on and on and on and on for the longest time. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end, but it just isn't enough to make this fun to watch in the least. Aside from passable stop motion animation, this short offers nothing of interest to me....NOTHING.<br /><br />By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees. It was a GREAT short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it. Could Pixar have not entered it?

unlikely.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","the","recipi","of","the","academi","award","for","well","anim","short","film","over","the","last","few","week","i","have","see","dozen","of","the","nomine","and","recipi","of","thi","award","from","the","last","year","and","i","realli","think","that","thi","film","mai","just","be","the","wrong","of","them","allyet","it","be","not","just","a","nomine","but","it","win","i","assum","that","must","have","just","be","a","horribl","year","for","the","genrebr","br","the","film","show","a","group","of","charact","that","look","a","bite","like","superskinni","uncl","fester","the","appear","to","be","simpl","articul","figur","who","be","move","us","stop","motion","anim","all","be","identicalwith","the","same","face","bodi","and","cloth","the","onli","differ","be","that","each","have","a","differ","numb","draw","on","their","back","thei","be","all","stand","on","a","larg","platform","that","be","suspend","a","if","by","magic","in","space","each","have","a","pole","and","their","be","conjur","a","box","on","the","platform","the","platform","begin","tilt","slightli","and","in","respons","the","man","move","about","in","a","effort","to","balanc","the","platform","thi","go","on","and","on","and","on","and","on","for","the","long","time","the","onli","relief","from","thi","tedium","be","when","on","of","them","act","rather","nasti","toward","the","end","but","it","just","be","not","enough","to","make","thi","fun","to","watch","in","the","littl","asid","from","passabl","stop","motion","anim","thi","short","offer","noth","of","interest","to","menothingbr","br","by","the","wai","the","great","short","knick","knack","conjur","come","out","in","and","i","have","no","idea","why","it","be","not","among","the","nomine","it","be","a","great","short","and","be","far","well","than","ani","of","the","nomine","that","year","or","the","year","befor","perhap","pixar","success","in","previou","year","result","in","a","bia","against","them","but","knick","knack","be","so","clever","and","so","funni","it","seem","almost","crimin","to","have","ignor","it","can","pixar","have","not","enter","it","thi","seem","unlik"],"filtered":["thi","film","recipi","academi","award","well","anim","short","film","last","week","see","dozen","nomine","recipi","thi","award","last","year","realli","think","thi","film","mai","wrong","allyet","nomine","win","assum","must","horribl","year","genrebr","br","film","show","group","charact","look","bite","like","superskinni","uncl","fester","appear","simpl","articul","figur","move","us","stop","motion","anim","identicalwith","face","bodi","cloth","onli","differ","differ","numb","draw","back","thei","stand","larg","platform","suspend","magic","space","pole","conjur","box","platform","platform","begin","tilt","slightli","respons","man","move","effort","balanc","platform","thi","go","long","time","onli","relief","thi","tedium","act","rather","nasti","toward","end","enough","make","thi","fun","watch","littl","asid","passabl","stop","motion","anim","thi","short","offer","noth","interest","menothingbr","br","wai","great","short","knick","knack","conjur","come","idea","among","nomine","great","short","far","well","ani","nomine","year","year","befor","perhap","pixar","success","previou","year","result","bia","knick","knack","clever","funni","seem","almost","crimin","ignor","pixar","enter","thi","seem","unlik"],"filtered2":["recipi","academi","award","well","anim","short","last","week","see","dozen","nomine","recipi","award","last","year","realli","think","mai","wrong","allyet","nomine","win","assum","must","horribl","year","genrebr","show","group","charact","look","bite","like","superskinni","uncl","fester","appear","simpl","articul","figur","move","us","stop","motion","anim","identicalwith","face","bodi","cloth","onli","differ","differ","numb","draw","back","stand","larg","platform","suspend","magic","space","pole","conjur","box","platform","platform","begin","tilt","slightli","respons","man","move","effort","balanc","platform","go","long","time","onli","relief","tedium","act","rather","nasti","toward","end","enough","make","fun","watch","littl","asid","passabl","stop","motion","anim","short","offer","noth","interest","menothingbr","wai","great","short","knick","knack","conjur","come","idea","among","nomine","great","short","far","well","ani","nomine","year","year","befor","perhap","pixar","success","previou","year","result","bia","knick","knack","clever","funni","seem","almost","crimin","ignor","pixar","enter","seem","unlik"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,16,20,21,24,25,27,28,33,34,35,39,45,46,49,51,56,57,60,62,63,79,93,99,101,123,131,141,144,147,154,160,170,204,230,251,259,272,275,277,315,318,376,377,401,410,415,447,489,507,516,532,563,564,576,615,637,654,736,762,784,826,857,879,915,920,936,955,965,1004,1021,1022,1033,1052,1170,1323,1670,1754,1880,2715,2847,3055,3064,3862,4530,4658,6851,6900,7222,8032],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.

{"value":"OK, I knew this would be a back alley F-film (well below B-film standards) going into it, so I thought, \"Man, I could use a good laugh, so let's see some nether-beings kill each other.\" Well, what I got could have been found at your local \"love toy\" store. Random lesbian scenes, very little fighting, and no plot.<br /><br />For example, one scene in particular I remember (for its sheer stupidity only; I've seen better porn on ABC) is where the two main characters (I can't remember their names offhand...great movie, huh?) are driving along, as they mostly did, and the driver was tired of driving and stopped:<br /><br />Driver: \"Let's pull over, I'm tired. You want to take over?\" Passenger: \"Sure, I can drive for a while.\" (Once pulled over, the driver starts grabbing the passenger's boobs) Passenger: \"What are you doing? I'm not like that!\" Driver: \"It's OK, everyone does it sometime.\" Passenger: \"OK then.\" (Proceed to take off shirts, fondle, kiss, and perform fellatio)<br /><br />Now, last time I checked, horror films were not in the porn section of Hollywood Video (unless you're into S&M, then you go elsewhere), and it definitely shouldn't be in the mainstream videos at Blockbuster. Don't get me wrong; I'm definitely not one of those people who hate porn, but I only watch it when appropriate and definitely don't want to watch it if I'm looking for a movie in the mainstream stores, as this one I rented was at one of the two retailers I named (and probably at the other too if I went and looked).<br /><br />Worst movie ever, no one should rent it, and it should only be bought for a public burning ceremony. If I could give it a 0, I would, but I can only give it a * of 10.","finished_norm":["okai","i","know","thi","would","be","a","back","allei","ffilm","good","below","bfilm","standard","go","into","it","so","i","think","man","i","can","us","a","good","laugh","so","let","see","some","netherb","kill","each","other","good","what","i","get","can","have","be","find","at","your","local","love","toi","store","random","lesbian","scene","veri","littl","fight","and","no","plotbr","br","for","exampl","on","scene","in","particular","i","rememb","for","it","sheer","stupid","onli","i","have","see","well","porn","on","abc","be","where","the","two","main","charact","i","ca","not","rememb","their","name","offhandgreat","movi","huh","be","drive","along","a","thei","mostli","do","and","the","driver","be","tire","of","drive","and","stoppedbr","br","driver","let","pull","over","i","be","tire","you","want","to","take","over","passeng","sure","i","can","drive","for","a","while","onc","pull","over","the","driver","start","grab","the","passeng","boob","passeng","what","be","you","do","i","be","not","like","that","driver","it","okai","everyon","doe","it","sometim","passeng","okai","then","proce","to","take","off","shirt","fondl","kiss","and","perform","fellatiobr","br","now","last","time","i","check","horror","film","be","not","in","the","porn","section","of","hollywood","video","unless","you","re","into","sm","then","you","go","elsewher","and","it","definit","should","not","be","in","the","mainstream","video","at","blockbust","do","not","get","me","wrong","i","be","definit","not","on","of","that","peopl","who","hate","porn","but","i","onli","watch","it","when","appropri","and","definit","do","not","want","to","watch","it","if","i","be","look","for","a","movi","in","the","mainstream","store","a","thi","on","i","rent","be","at","on","of","the","two","retail","i","name","and","probabl","at","the","other","too","if","i","go","and","lookedbr","br","wrong","movi","ever","no","on","should","rend","it","and","it","should","onli","be","bui","for","a","public","burn","ceremoni","if","i","can","give","it","a","i","would","but","i","can","onli","give","it","a","of"],"filtered":["okai","know","thi","back","allei","ffilm","good","bfilm","standard","go","think","man","us","good","laugh","let","see","netherb","kill","good","get","find","local","love","toi","store","random","lesbian","scene","veri","littl","fight","plotbr","br","exampl","scene","particular","rememb","sheer","stupid","onli","see","well","porn","abc","two","main","charact","ca","rememb","name","offhandgreat","movi","huh","drive","along","thei","mostli","driver","tire","drive","stoppedbr","br","driver","let","pull","tire","want","take","passeng","sure","drive","onc","pull","driver","start","grab","passeng","boob","passeng","like","driver","okai","everyon","doe","sometim","passeng","okai","proce","take","shirt","fondl","kiss","perform","fellatiobr","br","last","time","check","horror","film","porn","section","hollywood","video","unless","re","sm","go","elsewher","definit","mainstream","video","blockbust","get","wrong","definit","peopl","hate","porn","onli","watch","appropri","definit","want","watch","look","movi","mainstream","store","thi","rent","two","retail","name","probabl","go","lookedbr","br","wrong","movi","ever","rend","onli","bui","public","burn","ceremoni","give","onli","give"],"filtered2":["okai","know","back","allei","ffilm","good","bfilm","standard","go","think","man","us","good","laugh","let","see","netherb","kill","good","get","find","local","love","toi","store","random","lesbian","scene","veri","littl","fight","plotbr","exampl","scene","particular","rememb","sheer","stupid","onli","see","well","porn","abc","two","main","charact","ca","rememb","name","offhandgreat","huh","drive","along","mostli","driver","tire","drive","stoppedbr","driver","let","pull","tire","want","take","passeng","sure","drive","onc","pull","driver","start","grab","passeng","boob","passeng","like","driver","okai","everyon","doe","sometim","passeng","okai","proce","take","shirt","fondl","kiss","perform","fellatiobr","last","time","check","horror","porn","section","hollywood","video","unless","re","sm","go","elsewher","definit","mainstream","video","blockbust","get","wrong","definit","peopl","hate","porn","onli","watch","appropri","definit","want","watch","look","mainstream","store","rent","two","retail","name","probabl","go","lookedbr","wrong","ever","rend","onli","bui","public","burn","ceremoni","give","onli","give"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,6,7,8,10,11,12,14,15,16,18,19,20,23,25,26,30,31,37,38,44,45,47,54,56,63,68,71,76,81,83,105,119,124,133,136,143,144,148,179,191,233,236,240,246,290,300,307,324,339,347,392,460,461,475,500,505,510,533,544,616,661,780,793,832,859,862,900,971,1239,1412,1461,1550,1626,1680,1735,1748,1876,1878,2141,2350,2531,2665,2931,3236,3547,3552,3566,4151,4932,7544],"values":[1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0

{"value":"<br /><br />What is left of Planet Earth is populated by a few poor and starving rag-tag survivors. They must eat bugs and insects, or whatever, after a poison war, or something, has nearly wiped out all human civilization. In these dark times, one of the few people on Earth still able to live in comfort, we will call him the All Knowing Big Boss, has a great quest to prevent some secret spore seeds from being released into the air. It seems that the All Knowing Big Boss is the last person on Earth that knows that these spores even exist. The spores are located far away from any living soul, and they are highly protected by many layers of deadly defense systems. <br /><br />The All Knowing Big Boss wants the secret spores to remain in their secret protected containers. So, he makes a plan to send in a macho action team to remove the spore containers from all of the protective systems and secret location. Sending people to the location of secret spores makes them no longer a secret. Sending people to disable all of the protective systems makes it possible for the spores to be easily released into the air. How about letting sleeping dogs lie?! <br /><br />The one pleasant feature of ENCRYPT is the radiant and elegant Vivian Wu. As the unremarkable macho action team members drop off with mechanically paced predictable timing, engaging Vivian Wu's charm makes acceptable the plot idea of her old employer wanting her so much. She is an object of love, an object of desire -- a very believable concept!<br /><br />Fans of Vivian Wu may want to check out an outstanding B-movie she is in from a couple years back called DINNER RUSH. DINNER RUSH is highly recommended.

{"value":"(aka: TRINITY IS STILL MY NAME) This sequel looks like it was done to capitalize on the outstanding European box-office success of THEY CALL ME TRINITY, only this time Joseph E. Levine and Avco-Embassy pictures wanted to capitalize on it in America as well. Too bad they didn't get very far since the Hill/Spencer pictures have had only had marginal success here in the U.S., and this largely boring, drawn-out film doesn't help it out any.<br /><br />Trinity and Bambino swear to their dying father (Harry Carey Jr.) that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other. They later get involved with arms-traffickers who smuggle guns out of a monastery, and who mistakenly think they're a pair of federal agents. It all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes, especially the one where Trinity and Bambino are in a fancy French restaurant and don't know how to carry themselves. And the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as well.<br /><br />The opening title music sung by Gene Roman sounds like a fair Bobby Goldsboro-like early 70s pop song while the music cues sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good. Not sure if I'd want to buy the CD soundtrack of it but some others might.<br /><br />The film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it wouldn't have dragged on for so long. It looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed up here. In fact, I lost interest in it about 2/3rds of the way through. The DVD is also terrible, with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great scrap heap in the sky.<br /><br />A big step down from the

{"value":"Magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming, shrieking, overwrought, hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret, guilt and pain. PT Anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess.<br /><br />A look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent, and they were. I just wish that every scene didn't involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused.<br /><br />I also think that Anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film. The opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at. But the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display. I kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself, but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution. Throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the Old Testament.<br /><br />I will say that the music by Aimee Mann was great and I'll be looking for the Soundtrack CD.

{"value":"Near the beginning, after it's been established that outlaw John Dillinger (Warren Oates), is an egomaniacal rapist, another bandit of the 1930s is cornered in a farm house and surrounded by the FBI. Second-in-command Melvin Purvis (Ben Johnson), surveys the situations, sticks a lighted cigar in his mouth, picks up two loaded .45-caliber automatics, and stalks off into the distant house alone. Bang, bang, bang. Purvis emerges alone from the house, carrying the female hostage, the miscreant dead. All in long shot.<br /><br />If you're enthralled by stories like Red Riding Hood, this should have considerable appeal.<br /><br />Oh, it's as exciting as it is mindless. Pretty Boy Floyd meets his demise dramatically. Multiple violations of the civic code. Plenty of shoot outs with Tommy guns and pistols. Blood all over.<br /><br />As history, it stinks. Few remember Melvin Purvis as an FBI hero, partly, I would guess, because of his name. Melvin PURVIS? We all remember J. Edgar Hoover, who fired Melvin Purvis because he was a rival in the quest for public attention though.<br /><br />The picture was written and directed by John Milius. He's the guy who had it written into his contract that, should any animals be shot and killed in the course of one of his productions, he should be the designated shooter. Milius is the guy, a compleat gun freak, who had Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders in the Spanish-American war shouting quotations from Henry V -- \"Saint Crispin's Day\" and all that.<br /><br

{"value":"When I first saw a glimpse of this movie, I quickly noticed the actress who was playing the role of Lucille Ball. Rachel York's portrayal of Lucy is absolutely awful. Lucille Ball was an astounding comedian with incredible talent. To think about a legend like Lucille Ball being portrayed the way she was in the movie is horrendous. I cannot believe out of all the actresses in the world who could play a much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She might be a good actress in other roles but to play the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It is pretty hard to find someone who could resemble Lucille Ball, but they could at least find someone a bit similar in looks and talent. If you noticed York's portrayal of Lucy in episodes of I Love Lucy like the chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is similar in any way-her expression, voice, or movement.<br /><br />To top it all off, Danny Pino playing Desi Arnaz is horrible. Pino does not qualify to play as Ricky. He's small and skinny, his accent is unreal, and once again, his acting is unbelievable. Although Fred and Ethel were not similar either, they were not as bad as the characters of Lucy and Ricky.<br /><br />Overall, extremely horrible casting and the story is badly told. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography of Lucy and Desi, read the book from Lucille Ball herself, or PBS' American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see a docudrama, \"Before the Laughter\" would be a better choice. The casting of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in \"Before the Laughter\" is much better compared to this. At least, a similar aspect is shown rather than nothing.","finished_norm":["when","i","see","a","glimps","of","thi","movi","i","quickli","notic","the","actress","who","be","plai","the","role","of","lucil","ball","rachel","york","portray","of","luci","be","absolut","aw","lucil","ball","be","a","astound","comedian","with","incred","talent","to","think","about","a","legend","like","lucil","ball","be","portrai","the","wai","she","be","in","the","movi","be","horrend","i","cannot","believ","out","of","all","the","actress","in","the","world","who","can","plai","a","much","well","luci","the","produc","decid","to","get","rachel","york","she","mai","be","a","good","actress","in","other","role","but","to","plai","the","role","of","lucil","ball","be","tough","it","be","pretti","hard","to","find","someon","who","can","resembl","lucil","ball","but","thei","can","at","littl","find","someon","a","bite","similar","in","look","and","talent","if","you","notic","york","portray","of","luci","in","episod","of","i","love","luci","like","the","chocol","factori","or","vitavetavegamin","noth","be","similar","in","ani","wayher","express","voic","or","movementbr","br","to","top","it","all","off","danni","pino","plai","desi","arnaz","be","horribl","pino","doe","not","qualifi","to","plai","a","ricki","he","small","and","skinni","hi","accent","be","unreal","and","onc","again","hi","act","be","unbeliev","although","fred","and","ethel","be","not","similar","either","thei","be","not","a","bad","a","the","charact","of","luci","and","rickybr","br","overal","extrem","horribl","cast","and","the","stori","be","badli","tell","if","peopl","want","to","understand","the","real","life","situat","of","lucil","ball","i","suggest","watch","ae","biographi","of","luci","and","desi","read","the","book","from","lucil","ball","herself","or","pb","american","master","find","luci","if","you","want","to","see","a","docudrama","befor","the","laughter","would","be","a","well","choic","the","cast","of","lucil","ball","and","desi","arnaz","in","befor","the","laughter","be","much","well","compar","to","thi","at","littl","a","similar","aspect","be","show","rather","than","noth"],"filtered":["see","glimps","thi","movi","quickli","notic","actress","plai","role","lucil","ball","rachel","york","portray","luci","absolut","aw","lucil","ball","astound","comedian","incred","talent","think","legend","like","lucil","ball","portrai","wai","movi","horrend","believ","actress","world","plai","much","well","luci","produc","decid","get","rachel","york","mai","good","actress","role","plai","role","lucil","ball","tough","pretti","hard","find","someon","resembl","lucil","ball","thei","littl","find","someon","bite","similar","look","talent","notic","york","portray","luci","episod","love","luci","like","chocol","factori","vitavetavegamin","noth","similar","ani","wayher","express","voic","movementbr","br","top","danni","pino","plai","desi","arnaz","horribl","pino","doe","qualifi","plai","ricki","small","skinni","hi","accent","unreal","onc","hi","act","unbeliev","although","fred","ethel","similar","either","thei","bad","charact","luci","rickybr","br","overal","extrem","horribl","cast","stori","badli","tell","peopl","want","understand","real","life","situat","lucil","ball","suggest","watch","ae","biographi","luci","desi","read","book","lucil","ball","pb","american","master","find","luci","want","see","docudrama","befor","laughter","well","choic","cast","lucil","ball","desi","arnaz","befor","laughter","much","well","compar","thi","littl","similar","aspect","show","rather","noth"],"filtered2":["see","glimps","quickli","notic","actress","plai","role","lucil","ball","rachel","york","portray","luci","absolut","aw","lucil","ball","astound","comedian","incred","talent","think","legend","like","lucil","ball","portrai","wai","horrend","believ","actress","world","plai","well","luci","produc","decid","get","rachel","york","mai","good","actress","role","plai","role","lucil","ball","tough","pretti","hard","find","someon","resembl","lucil","ball","littl","find","someon","bite","similar","look","talent","notic","york","portray","luci","love","luci","like","chocol","factori","vitavetavegamin","noth","similar","ani","wayher","express","voic","movementbr","top","danni","pino","plai","desi","arnaz","horribl","pino","doe","qualifi","plai","ricki","small","skinni","accent","unreal","onc","act","unbeliev","although","fred","ethel","similar","either","bad","charact","luci","rickybr","overal","extrem","horribl","cast","stori","badli","tell","peopl","want","understand","real","life","situat","lucil","ball","suggest","watch","ae","biographi","luci","desi","read","book","lucil","ball","pb","american","master","find","luci","want","see","docudrama","befor","laughter","well","choic","cast","lucil","ball","desi","arnaz","befor","laughter","well","compar","littl","similar","aspect","show","rather","noth"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,4,7,9,10,12,14,16,17,18,20,21,23,27,28,33,37,38,40,46,49,54,75,78,79,80,90,91,92,128,138,139,145,151,154,160,165,17

{"value":"Do you know when you look at your collection of old, videotaped movies, and realize that there are some that you've only seen once or twice, and you can't remember if they're worth the time it takes to see them? The Alibi is/was one of those films; I found it, not long ago, and decided I might as well give it a chance. I'm not entirely sure if I'm happy with my decision... on one hand, the film is really, really bad, on the other, now I have another free tape... yeah, you get it. The plot is predictable and not in any way original. The pacing is bad. The acting is bad, but that's not really surprising, seeing as the two leads are former soap-opera stars... they're used to overact. The characters are poorly written clichÃ©s. The film even manages to screw up the easiest damn way to impress me(through film): court scenes. Even those don't elicit one single emotion for or against any of the cardboard-thin characters. The film just has no real redeeming qualities whatsoever... even the dialog is bad. The thing is, it's so full of clichÃ©s that it's laughable. And that's the one thing that lifts this above a rating of 1/10: the(albeit unintentionally so) comic relief of the many clichÃ©s and stereotypes. I didn't pay very much attention to the film, but just about every time I looked at the screen, there was something to laugh at. One final note: I considered using the line \"Tori Spelling can't act\" as a one line summary, but I guess everyone knows that, so I opted for the current one, seeing as it's more informative. All in all, a thoroughly bad film, but not the worst if you've got nothing else to do and if it's on TV. Good for a few laughs, if you can sit through it.

{"value":"This film was so disappointing. From the blurb that made me decide to see Phantom Love (why is it called this?)I had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery. It did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense. In fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time. In the end the effect was listless.<br /><br />I believe the film was meant to be atmospheric, but it just wasn't. The lack of a coherent plot did not help matters. You might say it was mysterious, but I think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere.<br /><br />The main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation. Without looking at the cast list I would not have known that you see the main character as a child. The film has very little context for the time, place or character. I am not a prude but the sex scenes (there were several) seemed pointless and confused me further, I recognised Lulu but I was not sure if it was the same man, different men, a lover, her husband or was she a prostitute. It was only when I saw the credits that I discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover. This film did manage to make what should have been shocking (dream sequences involving Lulu's mother) seem a bit boring.<br /><br />The nail filing actually made more sense, as it did give some indication of Lulu's emotional state. I will not fault the actors as I don't they had a lot to work on.<br /><br />I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dull.<br /><br />I can't be bothered talking about it

{"value":"Uwe Boll has done the impossible: create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game; he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content. So, as an adaptation, it's a success.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's still Uwe Boll we are dealing with here, so don't expect the movie to be actually any good. while it does have it's moment, \"Postal\" wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through.<br /><br />At its core, Postal is a satire on the United States, as done by a twelve year old kid. Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value: the more offensive, the funnier, and the more exaggerated the funnier. This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss. Yes, some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck. High points include the director satirizing himself, and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles. Low points include..well pretty much everything else.<br /><br />After the initial surprise wears off, Postal simply becomes a bore to watch. Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes, but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity.<br /><br />This probably would have worked as a short movie, but it's just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes (although it feels twice as long). There are nice ideas and nice tries, but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it

{"value":"Even though this was a made-for-TV production, there's absolutely no excuse for the rock bottom results of the finished product. This movie DID have a budget and it had a casting department, so, if you're going to make a movie about a true life story, and actually put \"the true story\" in the title, shouldn't some effort be put forward to try and capture some realism ? First of all, this movie is absurdly cast. These actors belong in daytime television soaps, or in those ridiculous Lifetime channel movies, and not in a real-life gangster/criminal tale. Everything about them, from their looks to their mannerisms, just screams of the 90's-shopping-mall-alt-rock-listening generation. What about the script ? Two words describes it - stupid and insulting, and again it's way too 90ish sounding. I don't think the real Clyde Barrow ever uttered the words \"I'm outta here.\" It's as if a bunch of \"New Kids on the Block\" fans got together and decided to make a really \"kewl flick\" about Bonnie and Clyde, you know, one that would be totally rad and rockin'. Well, this sticker doesn't even rank on the rad and rockin' scale. Everything that can be wrong with any kind of film is wrong here, from the casting and acting to the editing and music. Every single thing is grossly wrong....and it's infuriating that the parties responsible for this atrocious turkey had the nerve to put \"the true story\" in the title. It's certainly NOT the true story, but even worse, it's not even remotely entertaining as a mindless popcorn flick that's accepted on its own terms. Like I stated in my heading, it's simply horrible beyond words, on every level imaginable.
