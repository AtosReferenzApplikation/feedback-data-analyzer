{"value":"Yeah, I \"get\" Pasolini and his milieu, but at the same time, I feel his \"Decameron\" is largely overrated, and more than a little disturbing. Overrated because the supposed \"realism\" he introduces (milling crowds, crumbling architecture, etc.) are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave. In the pursuit of realism, Pasolini utilized many non-actors, but their deer-in-the-headlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off-kilter and inconsistent feel. And frankly -- many of the toothless, misshapenly-featured people are painful to look at.<br /><br />And Pasolini's \"Decameron\" is disturbing (to me at least) because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content. Not because I'm prudish or homophobic (I'm neither) but because the emphasis that Pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neo-realism he otherwise espouses, so it comes off as gratuitous and forced. One can almost hear him say \"Ooh--I've got to stick a cute, naked boy in this scene!\" At times it seems that Pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics, and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself, regardless of what his audience might prefer.<br /><br />The disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolini's \"Decameron\" struck me as being a failing of Pasolini as a storyteller, rather than being an aspect of neo-realism. He seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction. Even the Pasolini's final line of dialog in the film, which some people seem to find pithy (\"Why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter?\") -- to me, it just makes me wonder why Pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way? In my opinion, a far better-crafted film (and with MORE homosexual content) is Fellini's \"Satyricon\". It is also full of bizarre-looking people and absurd situations, but it succeeds because of its pacing, direction and strong storytelling whereas \"Decameron\" fails by those same elements.","finished_norm":["ye","i","get","pasolini","and","hi","milieu","but","at","the","same","time","i","feel","hi","decameron","be","larg","overr","and","much","than","a","littl","disturb","overr","becaus","the","suppos","realism","he","introduc","mill","crowd","crumbl","architectur","etc","be","moot","by","the","absurd","and","downright","goofi","wai","that","the","charact","behav","in","the","pursuit","of","realism","pasolini","util","mani","nonactor","but","their","deerintheheadlight","stare","and","painfulli","awkward","line","deliveri","give","the","whole","a","terribli","offkilt","and","inconsist","feel","and","frankli","mani","of","the","toothless","misshapenlyfeatur","peopl","be","pain","to","look","atbr","br","and","pasolini","decameron","be","disturb","to","me","at","littl","becaus","of","the","casual","and","preval","homosexu","content","not","becaus","i","be","prudish","or","homophob","i","be","neither","but","becaus","the","emphasi","that","pasolini","place","upon","homoerot","imag","and","situat","be","contrari","to","the","neoreal","he","otherwis","espous","so","it","come","off","a","gratuit","and","forc","on","can","almost","hear","him","sai","oohiv","get","to","stick","a","cute","nake","boi","in","thi","scene","at","time","it","seem","that","pasolini","be","try","to","plai","up","the","homosexu","angl","to","thumb","hi","nose","at","critic","and","at","other","time","becaus","he","enjoi","that","aspect","himself","regardless","of","what","hi","audienc","mai","preferbr","br","the","disjointed","of","the","or","differ","stori","in","pasolini","decameron","strike","me","a","be","a","fail","of","pasolini","a","a","storytel","rather","than","be","a","aspect","of","neoreal","he","seem","to","get","bore","with","each","stori","and","so","he","wrap","them","up","rather","unconvincingli","and","with","littl","convict","even","the","pasolini","final","line","of","dialog","in","the","film","which","some","peopl","seem","to","find","pithi","why","creat","a","work","of","art","when","dream","about","it","be","so","much","sweet","to","me","it","just","make","me","wonder","why","pasolini","would","bother","make","a","film","if","he","feel","thi","wai","in","my","opinion","a","far","bettercraft","film","and","with","much","homosexu","content","be","fellini","satyricon","it","be","conjur","full","of","bizarrelook","peopl","and","absurd","situat","but","it","succ","becaus","of","it","pace","direct","and","strong","storytel","wherea","decameron","fail","by","that","same","elem"],"filtered":["ye","get","pasolini","hi","milieu","time","feel","hi","decameron","larg","overr","much","littl","disturb","overr","becaus","suppos","realism","introduc","mill","crowd","crumbl","architectur","etc","moot","absurd","downright","goofi","wai","charact","behav","pursuit","realism","pasolini","util","mani","nonactor","deerintheheadlight","stare","painfulli","awkward","line","deliveri","give","whole","terribli","offkilt","inconsist","feel","frankli","mani","toothless","misshapenlyfeatur","peopl","pain","look","atbr","br","pasolini","decameron","disturb","littl","becaus","casual","preval","homosexu","content","becaus","prudish","homophob","neither","becaus","emphasi","pasolini","place","upon","homoerot","imag","situat","contrari","neoreal","otherwis","espous","come","gratuit","forc","almost","hear","sai","oohiv","get","stick","cute","nake","boi","thi","scene","time","seem","pasolini","try","plai","homosexu","angl","thumb","hi","nose","critic","time","becaus","enjoi","aspect","regardless","hi","audienc","mai","preferbr","br","disjointed","differ","stori","pasolini","decameron","strike","fail","pasolini","storytel","rather","aspect","neoreal","seem","get","bore","stori","wrap","rather","unconvincingli","littl","convict","even","pasolini","final","line","dialog","film","peopl","seem","find","pithi","creat","work","art","dream","much","sweet","make","wonder","pasolini","bother","make","film","feel","thi","wai","opinion","far","bettercraft","film","much","homosexu","content","fellini","satyricon","conjur","full","bizarrelook","peopl","absurd","situat","succ","becaus","pace","direct","strong","storytel","wherea","decameron","fail","elem"],"filtered2":["ye","get","pasolini","milieu","time","feel","decameron","larg","overr","littl","disturb","overr","becaus","suppos","realism","introduc","mill","crowd","crumbl","architectur","etc","moot","absurd","downright","goofi","wai","charact","behav","pursuit","realism","pasolini","util","mani","nonactor","deerintheheadlight","stare","painfulli","awkward","line","deliveri","give","whole","terribli","offkilt","inconsist","feel","frankli","mani","toothless","misshapenlyfeatur","peopl","pain","look","atbr","pasolini","decameron","disturb","littl","becaus","casual","preval","homosexu","content","becaus","prudish","homophob","neither","becaus","emphasi","pasolini","place","upon","homoerot","imag","situat","contrari","neoreal","otherwis","espous","come","gratuit","forc","almost","hear","oohiv","get

{"value":"There seems to be an overwhelming response to this movie yet no one with the insight to critique its methodology, which is extremely flawed. It simply continues to propogate journalistic style analysis, which is that it plays off of the audiences lack of knowledge and prejudice in order to evoke an emotional decry and outburst of negative diatribe.<br /><br />Journalism 101: tell the viewer some fact only in order to predispose them into drawing conclusions which are predictable. for instance, the idea of civil war, chaos, looting, etc were all supposedly unexpected responses to the collapse of governmental infrastructure following Hussein's demise: were these not all symptomatic of an already destitute culture? doctrinal infighting as symptomatic of these veins of Islam itself, rather than a failure in police force to restrain and secure? would they rather the US have declared marshall law? i'm sure the papers here would've exploded with accusations of a police state and fascist force.<br /><br />aside from the analytical idiocy of the film, it takes a few sideliners and leaves the rest out claiming \"so-and-so refused to be interviewed...\" yet the questions they would've asked are no doubt already answered by the hundred inquisitions those individuals have already received. would you, as vice president, deign to be interviewed by a first time writer/producer which was most certainly already amped to twist your words. they couldn't roll tape of Condi to actually show her opinion and answer some of the logistics of the questions, perhaps they never watched her hearing.<br /><br />this is far from a neutral glimpse of the situation on the ground there. this is another biased, asinine approach by journalists - which are, by and large, unthinking herds.<br /><br />anyone wanting to comment on war ought at least have based their ideas on things a little more reliable than NBC coverage and CNN commentary. these interpretations smack of the same vitriol which simply creates a further bipartisanism of those who want to think and those who want to be told by the media what to think.","finished_norm":["there","seem","to","be","a","overwhelm","respons","to","thi","movi","yet","no","on","with","the","insight","to","critiqu","it","methodologi","which","be","extrem","flaw","it","simpli","continu","to","propog","journalist","styl","analysi","which","be","that","it","plai","off","of","the","audienc","lack","of","knowledg","and","prejudic","in","order","to","evok","a","emot","decri","and","outburst","of","neg","diatribebr","br","journal","tell","the","viewer","some","fact","onli","in","order","to","predispos","them","into","draw","conclus","which","be","predict","for","instanc","the","idea","of","civil","war","chao","loot","etc","be","all","supposedli","unexpect","respons","to","the","collaps","of","government","infrastructur","follow","hussein","demis","be","thi","not","all","symptomat","of","a","alreadi","destitut","cultur","doctrin","infight","a","symptomat","of","thi","vein","of","islam","itself","rather","than","a","failur","in","polic","forc","to","restrain","and","secur","would","thei","rather","the","u","have","declar","marshal","law","i","be","sure","the","paper","here","would","have","explod","with","accus","of","a","polic","state","and","fascist","forcebr","br","asid","from","the","analyt","idioci","of","the","film","it","take","a","few","sidelin","and","leav","the","rest","out","claim","soandso","refus","to","be","interview","yet","the","question","thei","would","have","ask","be","no","doubt","alreadi","answer","by","the","hundr","inquisit","that","individu","have","alreadi","receiv","would","you","a","vice","presid","deign","to","be","interview","by","a","time","writerproduc","which","be","much","certainli","alreadi","amp","to","twist","your","word","thei","can","not","roll","tape","of","condi","to","actual","show","her","opinion","and","answer","some","of","the","logist","of","the","question","perhap","thei","never","watch","her","hearingbr","br","thi","be","far","from","a","neutral","glimps","of","the","situat","on","the","grind","there","thi","be","anoth","bia","asinin","approach","by","journalist","which","be","by","and","larg","unthink","herdsbr","br","anyon","want","to","comment","on","war","ought","at","littl","have","base","their","idea","on","thing","a","littl","much","reliabl","than","nbc","coverag","and","cnn","commentari","thi","interpret","smack","of","the","same","vitriol","which","simpli","creat","a","far","bipartisan","of","that","who","want","to","think","and","that","who","want","to","be","tell","by","the","medium","what","to","think"],"filtered":["seem","overwhelm","respons","thi","movi","yet","insight","critiqu","methodologi","extrem","flaw","simpli","continu","propog","journalist","styl","analysi","plai","audienc","lack","knowledg","prejudic","order","evok","emot","decri","outburst","neg","diatribebr","br","journal","tell","viewer","fact","onli","order","predispos","draw","conclus","predict","instanc","idea","civil","war","chao","loot","etc","supposedli","unexpect","respons","collaps","government","infrastructur","follow","hussein","demis","thi","symptomat","alreadi","destitut","cultur","doctrin","infight","symptomat","thi","vein","islam","rather","failur","polic","forc","restrain","secur","thei","rather","u","declar","marshal","law","sure","paper","explod","accus","polic","state","fascist","forcebr","br","asid","analyt","idioci","film","take","sidelin","leav","rest","claim","soandso","refus","interview","yet","question","thei","ask","doubt","alreadi","answer","hundr","inquisit","individu","alreadi","receiv","vice","presid","deign","interview","time","writerproduc","much","certainli","alreadi","amp","twist","word","thei","roll","tape","condi","actual","show","opinion","answer","logist","question","perhap","thei","never","watch","hearingbr","br","thi","far","neutral","glimps","situat","grind","thi","anoth","bia","asinin","approach","journalist","larg","unthink","herdsbr","br","anyon","want","comment","war","littl","base","idea","thing","littl","much","reliabl","nbc","coverag","cnn","commentari","thi","interpret","smack","vitriol","simpli","creat","far","bipartisan","want","think","want","tell","medium","think"],"filtered2":["seem","overwhelm","respons","yet","insight","critiqu","methodologi","extrem","flaw","simpli","continu","propog","journalist","styl","analysi","plai","audienc","lack","knowledg","prejudic","order","evok","emot","decri","outburst","neg","diatribebr","journal","tell","viewer","fact","onli","order","predispos","draw","conclus","predict","instanc","idea","civil","war","chao","loot","etc","supposedli","unexpect","respons","collaps","government","infrastructur","follow","hussein","demis","symptomat","alreadi","destitut","cultur","doctrin","infight","symptomat","vein","islam","rather","failur","polic","forc","restrain","secur","rather","u","declar","marshal","law","sure","paper","explod","accus","polic","state","fascist","forcebr","asid","analyt","idioci","take","sidelin","leav","rest","claim","soandso","refus","interview","yet","question","

{"value":"I have grown up reading Modesty Blaise, both the comics and the books, and she truly is a heroine to me. Although not being a great fan of Quentin Tarantino I anyway was interested to hear a few years back that he was considering making a film of her: could he finally give Modesty a nice big screen treatment she's worthy of? I heard of 'My Name Is Modesty' a few months ago and checked the stars it had been given here, and wasn't too surprised to find out the score was not too high, since beloved characters often have hard time melting the fans' heart if not done exactly right. So I decided not to read any reviews and see the film instead, and well, I just finished watching it, and I'm stunned, and sad, and yeah, pretty furious, too. Sad and furious of giving over an hour of my time seeing something so fabulous as Modesty Blaise-character being turned into a film that has nothing to give to a viewer or a fan.<br /><br />It seems that almost everything about this film is sub-par and unprofessional, although I must admit seeing some actors in other films earlier where they were fine so I can't blame them. But the screenplay and the directing... my god, why even make this kind of crap with production values slightly bigger than your average TV-film but done much worse? I don't know the background of this film and actually I really don't want to know, but I just can't help wondering that how on earth could Tarantino with a straight face tell that he loves Modesty and then put his name on this? He just lost a huge amount of respect in my eyes. The director was not the right man for this job and I can honestly thank him for ruining my night.<br /><br />I give this film 3 stars and those stars go to the actors and the technical quality which could've been worse. The other seven stars missing are what this film was not good at. Oh well, hopefully at some point there will be a serious production of The Modesty Blaise Movie that has some other goals than to steal money from the Modesty fans. Although if people like Tarantino are the ones making the decisions I'm not holding my

{"value":"Ah, Lucio Fulci, rest in peace. This infamous Italian is most<br /><br />famous for \"Zombie,\" and the absolutely unwatchable \"The<br /><br />Psychic\" and \"Manhattan Baby.\" Well, add this to the unwatchable<br /><br />list.<br /><br />The plot, as it were, concerns a nekkid woman who wears a gold<br /><br />mask and a G-string. She wants the power of a young dubbed<br /><br />stud who has a set of magic arrows and a bow. They are magic<br /><br />because they glow. Arrow boy teams up with a guy in a bad wig,<br /><br />and they spend most of the movie rescuing each other from flat<br /><br />action sequences. In the end, the nekkid chick is defeated, but not<br /><br />before taking the mask off and reminding me why I broke up with<br /><br />my high school girlfriend.<br /><br />Fulci bathes every shot in an orange glow and fills the screen with<br /><br />smoke. Nothing like a smoky orange action sequence to make you<br /><br />crave Sunny Delight and a cigarette. The special effects are<br /><br />laughable. In one sequence, our ambiguously gay duo are<br /><br />attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously pin scratches on<br /><br />the film itself. The majority of the effects budget must have been<br /><br />spent on the Fulci-licious gore, which consists entirely of spurting<br /><br />wounds. Hey, we can all use a good spurting wound once in a<br /><br />while, but when you get into spurting wound overkill, it gets boring.<br /><br />I kept having to play with the brightness setting on my TV anyway<br /><br />just to see what the heck was happening.<br /><br />There is lots of talk of fulfilling omens and prophecies, so let me<br /><br />do a little look into the future...if you find this movie and watch it,<br /><br />you will regret it.

{"value":"First off, this is no where near as bad as some of the other trash the Sci-Fi Channel has produced; that isn't to say that Grendel is a good film, in fact, it is very bad, but it definitely had potential to be a lot better. The flaws of the film come from character design, character, absurd additions to the story, the visual effects, the music, and for the most part: the acting.<br /><br />When speaking of character design, I, of course, mean the way our heroes and villains look. Beowulf and the other Danes seem like ridiculous Vikings, rather than warriors of brute strength -- that helmet our main protagonist wears is just too silly. Grendel looks like the Hulk but with strange tentacle-attachments to his elbows.<br /><br />The characters are very limited. Beowulf is same from beginning to end, however Finn -- a useless sidekick -- achieved some two-dimensionality, due thanks to his romantic subplot, and Unferth gets some notion as well, as he becomes less conceited.<br /><br />Much like Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it its own, while still holding to the source material. The crossbow that is gifted to Beowulf is so ridiculous, I'm surprised the cast didn't walk off the set. Besides additions, there's omissions, such as the underlying themes of Christianity and Paganism, as well as the consequences of lying.<br /><br />The special effects are mighty terrible. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly conceived, and as such, they're portrayal on screen is less than believable.<br /><br />The music is overbearing, especially when a character dies.<br /><br />All in all, this is not Sci-Fi's worst film to date. No. It is actually one of the better films, though trash it still it is, it is good trash, making it a guilty pleasure at best. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still wooden here and there.<br /><br />I highly recommend you skip this film and watch Robert Zemeckis' take on the ancient story of Beowulf, simply because this film (Grendel) is only half the tale, and not the whole thing, which garners this movie a three-star review.","finished_norm":["off","thi","be","no","where","near","a","bad","a","some","of","the","other","trash","the","scifi","channel","have","produc","that","be","not","to","sai","that","grendel","be","a","good","film","in","fact","it","be","veri","bad","but","it","definit","have","potenti","to","be","a","lot","well","the","flaw","of","the","film","come","from","charact","design","charact","absurd","addit","to","the","stori","the","visual","effect","the","music","and","for","the","much","part","the","actingbr","br","when","speak","of","charact","design","i","of","cours","mean","the","wai","our","hero","and","villain","look","beowulf","and","the","other","dane","seem","like","ridicul","vike","rather","than","warrior","of","brute","strength","that","helmet","our","main","protagonist","wear","be","just","too","silli","grendel","look","like","the","hulk","but","with","strang","tentacleattach","to","hi","elbowsbr","br","the","charact","be","veri","limit","beowulf","be","same","from","begin","to","end","howev","finn","a","useless","sidekick","achiev","some","twodimension","due","thank","to","hi","romant","subplot","and","unferth","get","some","notion","a","good","a","he","becom","littl","conceitedbr","br","much","like","finn","there","be","useless","addit","to","thi","stori","to","make","it","it","own","while","still","hold","to","the","sourc","materi","the","crossbow","that","be","gift","to","beowulf","be","so","ridicul","i","be","surpris","the","cast","do","not","walk","off","the","set","besid","addit","there","omiss","such","a","the","underli","theme","of","christian","and","pagan","a","good","a","the","consequ","of","lyingbr","br","the","special","effect","be","mighti","terribl","grendel","and","hi","mother","hag","be","poorli","conceiv","and","a","such","thei","re","portray","on","screen","be","littl","than","believablebr","br","the","music","be","overbear","especi","when","a","charact","diesbr","br","all","in","all","thi","be","not","scifi","wrong","film","to","date","no","it","be","actual","on","of","the","well","film","though","trash","it","still","it","be","it","be","good","trash","make","it","a","guilti","pleasur","at","well","the","onli","thing","that","work","be","the","dialogu","which","be","still","wooden","here","and","therebr","br","i","highli","recommend","you","skip","thi","film","and","watch","robert","zemecki","take","on","the","ancient","stori","of","beowulf","simpli","becaus","thi","film","grendel","be","onli","half","the","tale","and","not","the","whole","thing","which","garner","thi","movi","a","threestar","review"],"filtered":["thi","near","bad","trash","scifi","channel","produc","sai","grendel","good","film","fact","veri","bad","definit","potenti","lot","well","flaw","film","come","charact","design","charact","absurd","addit","stori","visual","effect","music","much","part","actingbr","br","speak","charact","design","cours","mean","wai","hero","villain","look","beowulf","dane","seem","like","ridicul","vike","rather","warrior","brute","strength","helmet","main","protagonist","wear","silli","grendel","look","like","hulk","strang","tentacleattach","hi","elbowsbr","br","charact","veri","limit","beowulf","begin","end","howev","finn","useless","sidekick","achiev","twodimension","due","thank","hi","romant","subplot","unferth","get","notion","good","becom","littl","conceitedbr","br","much","like","finn","useless","addit","thi","stori","make","still","hold","sourc","materi","crossbow","gift","beowulf","ridicul","surpris","cast","walk","set","besid","addit","omiss","underli","theme","christian","pagan","good","consequ","lyingbr","br","special","effect","mighti","terribl","grendel","hi","mother","hag","poorli","conceiv","thei","re","portray","screen","littl","believablebr","br","music","overbear","especi","charact","diesbr","br","thi","scifi","wrong","film","date","actual","well","film","though","trash","still","good","trash","make","guilti","pleasur","well","onli","thing","work","dialogu","still","wooden","therebr","br","highli","recommend","skip","thi","film","watch","robert","zemecki","take","ancient","stori","beowulf","simpli","becaus","thi","film","grendel","onli","half","tale","whole","thing","garner","thi","movi","threestar","review"],"filtered2":["near","bad","trash","scifi","channel","produc","grendel","good","fact","veri","bad","definit","potenti","lot","well","flaw","come","charact","design","charact","absurd","addit","stori","visual","effect","music","part","actingbr","speak","charact","design","cours","mean","wai","hero","villain","look","beowulf","dane","seem","like","ridicul","vike","rather","warrior","brute","strength","helmet","main","protagonist","wear","silli","grendel","look","like","hulk","strang","tentacleattach","elbowsbr","charact","veri","limit","beowulf","begin","end","howev","finn","useless","sidekick","achiev","twodimension","due","thank","romant","subplot","unferth","get","notion","good","becom","littl","conceitedbr","like","finn","useless","addit","stori","make","still

{"value":"\"Raw Force\" is like an ultra-sleazy and perverted version of Love Boat, with additional Kung Fu fights, demented cannibalistic monks, white slaves trade, energetic zombies and a whole lot of lousy acting performances. No wonder this movie was included in the recently released \"Grindhouse Experience 20 movie box-set\". It's got everything exploitation fanatics are looking for, blend in a totally incoherent and seemingly improvised script! The production values are extremely poor and the technical aspects are pathetic, but the amounts of gratuitous violence & sex can hardly be described. The film opens at a tropically sunny location called Warriors Island, where a troop of sneering monks raise the dead for no apparent reason other than to turn them into Kung Fu fighters. The monks also buy sexy slaves from a sleazy Hitler look-alike businessman, supposedly because the women's flesh supplies them with the required powers to increase their zombie army. Tourists on a passing cruise ship, among them three martial arts fighters, a female LA cop and a whole bunch of ravishing but dim-witted ladies, are attacked by the Hitler guy's goons because they were planning an excursion to Warriors Island. Their lifeboat washes ashore the island anyway, and the monks challenge the survivors to a fighting test with their zombies. Okay, how does that sound for a crazy midnight horror movie mess? It's not over yet, because \"Raw Force\" also has piranhas, wild boat orgies, Cameron Mitchell in yet another embarrassing lead role and 70's exploitation duchess Camille Keaton (\"I spit on your Grave\") in an utterly insignificant cameo appearance. There's loads of badly realized gore, including axe massacres and decapitations, hammy jokes and bad taste romance. The trash-value of this movie will literally leave you speechless. The evil monks' background remains, naturally, unexplained and they don't even become punished for their questionable hobbies. Maybe that's why the movie stops with \"To Be Continued\", instead of with \"The End\". The sequel never came, unless it's so obscure IMDb doesn't even list

{"value":"Home Alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies. It's the cream of the crop, or s*** if you tend to be more cynical, as it ranks up (or down) there with stuff like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones: Viva Rock Vegas. In fact, it could even be worse than those two, since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity. This just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling. No other movie has made me cringe in pain. Now I will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious.<br /><br />First off, the plot is ridiculous. It revolves around a chip in a remote control car (?!) that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it. Dumb stuff.<br /><br />The action that ensues is similar to that of the other two Home Alones, with boobytraps and all, but watching these boobytraps being executed is, rather than being funny, incredibly unpleasant to watch. I didn't laugh (or even so much as smile) once, rather, I cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid. The bird, rather than providing comic relief, was unfunny and annoying.<br /><br />The acting, as done by a bunch of no names, ranges from poor to atrocious. There is not a single good performance here. Alex D.Linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid, while the terrorists act (and judging by their movie credits, look) as they've been hastily picked off the street...and well, that's it.<br /><br />I can see some people saying: \"Man, it's for the kids. Don't dis it, man.\" Well MAN, kids may like this, but they can get a hell of a lot better. See Monsters Inc. and Toy Story before even considering getting this out. Hell, even Scooby Doo and Garfield (which suck - see those reviews for more) are better than this! <br /><br />So in short, this is an irredeemably atrocious movie. This was clearly recycled for the money, as it almost completely rips off the first two; the only thing is, it completely insults the first two as well.

{"value":"As a \"lapsed Catholic\" who had 11 years of Catholic school, but hasn't been to Mass in 35 years except for weddings and funerals, I thought I'd get a kick out of this. And I did . . . for the first two-thirds of the movie. It was all the standard stuff -- strict parochial school teachings, repressed sexuality, etc. But then, suddenly, the movie turned mean. REALLY mean. Now mind you, I saw this before the pedophilia scandals hit . . . and maybe I wouldn't have been quite so offended at such nasty, hateful digs at the Catholic Church if I'd known about those abominations (such a Catholic term!) and coverups.<br /><br />It's been a few years since I rented the video, and I won't go back to rent it again with a new perspective. It just left such a dirty, nasty, ugly taste in my mouth . . . I wonder what experience all the actors had with the Church, because either they *really* hate it, or they whored themselves for the paycheck. It's an incredibly anti-Catholic movie, offensive to anyone who has a glimmer of a gleam of respect for Catholic education. Which I still do because there were no better teachers back in the '50s. Whatever else those nuns did, they forced me to learn how to read and write the English language. They made us memorize. (How many kids today can do simple arithmetic in their heads?) Truth is, there's nothing more essential for success in America. Can ya read? Can ya add/subtract/multiply/divide? Great. You can get any advanced degree you want. And the discipline of Catholic education will stand you in good stead, not just as you continue your studies, but also for the rest of your life, no matter what you think of the Catholic \"mythology\" we all had to learn.<br /><br />Such a great cast, such a lousy, rotten script. I really feel bad (and no, it's not \"badly\" -- trust me, the nuns taught me better) for the writer and director.<br /><br />I thought I had mixed emotions about Catholic school. But the participants in this project must've been those bad (ie.e, stupid) kids who sat in the back of the room, if they were willingly involved in making this movie.","finished_norm":["a","a","laps","cathol","who","have","year","of","cathol","school","but","have","not","be","to","mass","in","year","except","for","wed","and","funer","i","think","i","have","get","a","kick","out","of","thi","and","i","do","for","the","twothird","of","the","movi","it","be","all","the","standard","stuff","strict","parochi","school","teach","repress","sexual","etc","but","then","suddenli","the","movi","turn","mean","realli","mean","now","mind","you","i","see","thi","befor","the","pedophilia","scandal","hit","and","mayb","i","would","not","have","be","quit","so","offend","at","such","nasti","hate","dig","at","the","cathol","church","if","i","have","know","about","that","abomin","such","a","cathol","term","and","coverupsbr","br","it","be","a","few","year","sinc","i","rent","the","video","and","i","wo","not","go","back","to","rend","it","again","with","a","new","perspect","it","just","leav","such","a","dirti","nasti","ugli","tast","in","my","mouth","i","wonder","what","experi","all","the","actor","have","with","the","church","becaus","either","thei","realli","hate","it","or","thei","whore","themselv","for","the","paycheck","it","a","incredibli","anticathol","movi","offens","to","anyon","who","have","a","glimmer","of","a","gleam","of","respect","for","cathol","educ","which","i","still","do","becaus","there","be","no","well","teacher","back","in","the","whatev","els","that","nun","do","thei","forc","me","to","learn","how","to","read","and","write","the","english","languag","thei","make","u","memor","how","mani","kid","todai","can","do","simpl","arithmet","in","their","head","truth","be","there","noth","much","essenti","for","success","in","america","can","you","read","can","you","addsubtractmultiplydivid","great","you","can","get","ani","advanc","degre","you","want","and","the","disciplin","of","cathol","educ","will","stand","you","in","good","stead","not","just","a","you","continu","your","studi","but","conjur","for","the","rest","of","your","life","no","matt","what","you","think","of","the","cathol","mythologi","we","all","have","to","learnbr","br","such","a","great","cast","such","a","lousi","rotten","script","i","realli","feel","bad","and","no","it","not","badli","trust","me","the","nun","teach","me","well","for","the","writer","and","directorbr","br","i","think","i","have","mix","emot","about","cathol","school","but","the","particip","in","thi","project","must","have","be","that","bad","iee","stupid","kid","who","sit","in","the","back","of","the","room","if","thei","be","willingli","involv","in","make","thi","movi"],"filtered":["laps","cathol","year","cathol","school","mass","year","except","wed","funer","think","get","kick","thi","twothird","movi","standard","stuff","strict","parochi","school","teach","repress","sexual","etc","suddenli","movi","turn","mean","realli","mean","mind","see","thi","befor","pedophilia","scandal","hit","mayb","quit","offend","nasti","hate","dig","cathol","church","know","abomin","cathol","term","coverupsbr","br","year","sinc","rent","video","wo","go","back","rend","new","perspect","leav","dirti","nasti","ugli","tast","mouth","wonder","experi","actor","church","becaus","either","thei","realli","hate","thei","whore","themselv","paycheck","incredibli","anticathol","movi","offens","anyon","glimmer","gleam","respect","cathol","educ","still","becaus","well","teacher","back","whatev","els","nun","thei","forc","learn","read","write","english","languag","thei","make","u","memor","mani","kid","todai","simpl","arithmet","head","truth","noth","much","essenti","success","america","read","addsubtractmultiplydivid","great","get","ani","advanc","degre","want","disciplin","cathol","educ","stand","good","stead","continu","studi","conjur","rest","life","matt","think","cathol","mythologi","learnbr","br","great","cast","lousi","rotten","script","realli","feel","bad","badli","trust","nun","teach","well","writer","directorbr","br","think","mix","emot","cathol","school","particip","thi","project","must","bad","iee","stupid","kid","sit","back","room","thei","willingli","involv","make","thi","movi"],"filtered2":["laps","cathol","year","cathol","school","mass","year","except","wed","funer","think","get","kick","twothird","standard","stuff","strict","parochi","school","teach","repress","sexual","etc","suddenli","turn","mean","realli","mean","mind","see","befor","pedophilia","scandal","hit","mayb","quit","offend","nasti","hate","dig","cathol","church","know","abomin","cathol","term","coverupsbr","year","sinc","rent","video","wo","go","back","rend","new","perspect","leav","dirti","nasti","ugli","tast","mouth","wonder","experi","actor","church","becaus","either","realli","hate","whore","themselv","paycheck","incredibli","anticathol","offens","anyon","glimmer","gleam","respect","cathol","educ","still","becaus","well","teacher","back","whatev","els","nun","forc","learn","read","write","english","languag","make","u","memor","mani","kid","todai","simpl","arithmet","head","truth","noth","essent

{"value":"We should all congratulate Uwe Boll. He's done the unthinkable. He may be the only director to have two movies in the bottom 100 on IMDb! He's like some kind of cinematic cockroach. No matter how little talent he has, and no matter how bad these movies are, he manages to keep making them. I know, he finances them all himself through some kind of bizarre German fund, but even so, his ability to keep making movies despite absolute, complete failure is one of the great mysteries of the universe.<br /><br />It wouldn't be so bad except that video game developers keep giving their best properties to this guy. I really enjoyed the Alone in the Dark series of games. Even the latest one, the New Nightmare, was good for a few hours of game play. There was a good movie to be made out of Edward Carnby's adventures, but this is not it. Now Uwe Boll has gotten his hands on Bloodrayne and Hunter: the Reckoning. What's next, Silent Hill? Doom? I can only imagine the swath that this guy is going to cut through game-to-movie adaptations if he's not stopped. Someone needs to take away his line of credit, or these video game publishers need to wise up and realize that when they make a bad movie out of a game that kills the franchise, no one is interested in that title any more.<br /><br />Think about it, is House of the Dead or Alone in the Dark a viable game title anymore? No way. A new House of the Dead game comes out for X-Box and nobody's gonna care. The title is dead, and all because of Uwe Boll. So if any of you out there work for a game publisher, or know a game publisher, or have access to a game publisher... please warn them. <br /><br />This movie itself is not even worth reviewing. I can't separate what I didn't like about this pile of dung from the rest of it. Literally, everything about it sucks. The writing, the acting, the music, the CG effects, the editing.

{"value":"I'm in Iraq right now doing a job that gives plenty of time for watching movies. We also have access to plenty of pirated movies, this gem came along with 11 other movies, and this is easily the worst I've seen in a long time. I've seen a few other reviews that claim this movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but really, I think that's a cover up for the fact that its horrible. It's not tongue in cheek, the writers really thought they were improving on the movie Blade. This movie is just one notch above Vampire Assassin, which if you haven't seen, i recommend. At least that movie is so unbelievably bad that you'll laugh harder than you thought possible. This is right at that cusp of no redeeming qualities what so ever. from the bad acting, to cliché visual (ie opening credits), to the adobe premier special effects. they couldn't even get blanks for the guns, which may have to do with where the movie was filmed, but if you're going to use effects, make them close to accurate. as for the cast, it seems like they just went to a tae bo class and picked up the first not to ugly chick that walked out. Once again, like Ron Hall in Vampire Assassin, don't let stunt folk act, they can't. Also, the comment about this being a \"return of old vampire movies\"...no, it's not. This is exactly what all new vampire movies are about. Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Blade, Underworld, they're all about some super star fighting the vampires. This is the newest vampire genre, with bad blood, fake screams, and cheesy over acting. obviously anyone who wrote a good review about this is somehow connected to the movie, or friends of the cast. But what do I care, I paid 33 cents for it. Anyway, to wrap this up, someone in their first semester of film school decided to make a movie, I give them credit because it's better than I could do. Of course I also know I can't make movies so I don't try. I do know how to watch movies though. I work 12 hour nights, 6 days a week, I've seen several thousand in the year I've been out here and this was so bad that half way through i was hoping for a mortar

{"value":"It's got Christopher Lee, it's got huge banks of 1970s computers that make Teletype noises as letters appear on the screen, it's got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises, it's got volcanoes! evil aliens disguised as nuns! tidal waves! earthquakes! exploding cars! exploding coffee machines! and as a climax the entire planet blows up. How on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly, mind-numbingly DULL? The answer, my friend is because 90% of this movie is made up of establishing shots, most of them involving long tracks, pans, or zooms in combinations, or occasionally all three, that do nothing except give the crew something to do. There are endless shots of our protagonists driving, getting in and out of cars, driving again, walking around looking at stuff, getting in cars and driving... I just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering \"Say something, please somebody, just say something... DO something... anything!...\"<br /><br />The dialogue, when it does come, is terrible.<br /><br />\"Maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours.\" was a typically meaningless line. The script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage, justified in this speech from Lee as the head alien:<br /><br />\"The planet Earth has emitted an over-abundance of diseases, they are contaminating the Universe. All the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed!\" <br /><br />This is is Neanderthal SF script writing. This is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950's Japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds. It is, and I collect such things, the most god-awful line from an English language SF movie since Buster Crabbe retired. It beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as Star Wars and Close Encounters.<br /><br />Lee, who always struck me as a smart, useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits, delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek. I don't blame him.","finished_norm":["it","get","christoph","lee","it","get","huge","bank","of","comput","that","make","teletyp","nois","a","letter","appear","on","the","screen","it","get","radioact","isotop","that","not","onli","glow","in","the","dark","but","emit","puls","thrum","nois","it","get","volcano","evil","alien","disguis","a","nun","tidal","wave","earthquak","explod","car","explod","coffe","machin","and","a","a","climax","the","entir","planet","blow","up","how","on","earth","doe","thi","film","manag","to","be","so","incredibli","mindnumbingli","dull","the","answer","my","friend","be","becaus","of","thi","movi","be","make","up","of","establish","shot","much","of","them","involv","long","track","pan","or","zoom","in","combin","or","occasion","all","three","that","do","noth","except","give","the","crow","someth","to","do","there","be","endless","shot","of","our","protagonist","drive","get","in","and","out","of","car","drive","again","walk","around","look","at","stuff","get","in","car","and","drive","i","just","sit","there","watch","endless","parad","of","nothing","in","stupefact","mutter","sai","someth","pleas","somebodi","just","sai","someth","do","someth","anythingbr","br","the","dialogu","when","it","doe","come","be","terriblebr","br","mayb","their","minut","be","measur","on","a","differ","scale","than","our","be","a","typic","meaningless","line","the","script","culmin","in","the","destruct","of","the","world","by","stock","footag","justifi","in","thi","speech","from","lee","a","the","head","alienbr","br","the","planet","earth","have","emit","a","overabund","of","diseas","thei","be","contamin","the","univers","all","the","planet","light","year","awai","from","here","will","suffer","unless","it","be","destroi","br","br","thi","be","be","neanderth","sf","script","write","thi","be","the","sort","of","motiv","you","find","in","the","sort","of","japanes","monster","suit","movi","aim","at","year","old","it","be","and","i","collect","such","thing","the","much","godaw","line","from","a","english","languag","sf","movi","sinc","buster","crabb","retir","it","beggar","belief","that","thi","movi","be","releas","in","the","same","year","a","star","war","and","close","encountersbr","br","lee","who","alwai","strike","me","a","a","smart","us","actor","with","a","sure","knowledg","of","hi","limit","deliv","hi","line","a","if","he","be","go","to","kill","hi","agent","for","get","him","into","thi","pile","of","drek","i","do","not","blame","him"],"filtered":["get","christoph","lee","get","huge","bank","comput","make","teletyp","nois","letter","appear","screen","get","radioact","isotop","onli","glow","dark","emit","puls","thrum","nois","get","volcano","evil","alien","disguis","nun","tidal","wave","earthquak","explod","car","explod","coffe","machin","climax","entir","planet","blow","earth","doe","thi","film","manag","incredibli","mindnumbingli","dull","answer","friend","becaus","thi","movi","make","establish","shot","much","involv","long","track","pan","zoom","combin","occasion","three","noth","except","give","crow","someth","endless","shot","protagonist","drive","get","car","drive","walk","around","look","stuff","get","car","drive","sit","watch","endless","parad","nothing","stupefact","mutter","sai","someth","pleas","somebodi","sai","someth","someth","anythingbr","br","dialogu","doe","come","terriblebr","br","mayb","minut","measur","differ","scale","typic","meaningless","line","script","culmin","destruct","world","stock","footag","justifi","thi","speech","lee","head","alienbr","br","planet","earth","emit","overabund","diseas","thei","contamin","univers","planet","light","year","awai","suffer","unless","destroi","br","br","thi","neanderth","sf","script","write","thi","sort","motiv","find","sort","japanes","monster","suit","movi","aim","year","old","collect","thing","much","godaw","line","english","languag","sf","movi","sinc","buster","crabb","retir","beggar","belief","thi","movi","releas","year","star","war","close","encountersbr","br","lee","alwai","strike","smart","us","actor","sure","knowledg","hi","limit","deliv","hi","line","go","kill","hi","agent","get","thi","pile","drek","blame"],"filtered2":["get","christoph","lee","get","huge","bank","comput","make","teletyp","nois","letter","appear","screen","get","radioact","isotop","onli","glow","dark","emit","puls","thrum","nois","get","volcano","evil","alien","disguis","nun","tidal","wave","earthquak","explod","car","explod","coffe","machin","climax","entir","planet","blow","earth","doe","manag","incredibli","mindnumbingli","dull","answer","friend","becaus","make","establish","shot","involv","long","track","pan","zoom","combin","occasion","three","noth","except","give","crow","someth","endless","shot","protagonist","drive","get","car","drive","walk","around","look","stuff","get","car","drive","sit","watch","endless","parad","nothing","stupefact","mutter","someth","pleas","somebodi","someth","someth","anythingbr","dialogu","doe","come","terriblebr","mayb","minut","measur","differ","sca

{"value":"Did I step in something or is that bad smell coming from Daybreak 1 + 2? God was behind everything? What has God got to do with Sci-Fi? God is only the answer when you can't think up a sensible explanation for something. In fact, this is exactly the problem with the series finale - they obviously couldn't think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how Kara Thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper, how her old viper and charred body ended up on Earth 2, why Baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head, why 6 has an imaginary Baltar in her head, etc. so they explain it with \"angels\" or just don't explain it at all.<br /><br />The plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a Basestar through. For example, why does Galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl (Hera), particularly after Adama said there was no way he'd attempt a rescue? Because they found out the location of the Cylon base? That's not a good reason to sacrifice the crew's lives. And how did Anders know the location? And what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters' lives before the war? It's like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment.<br /><br />The people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series. Feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical Christians on a mission to spread 'The Word'. Forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot, the important message the writers wanted to get across is: don't put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction; God is your ultimate salvation (tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment).<br /><br />Imagine in the final movie of the Star Wars series they tell you there is no \"force\"... instead, a Jedi actually gets his power from Jesus. Then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the Ewoks. Would this be a good ending? No it frakken' wouldn't.","finished_norm":["do","i","step","in","someth","or","be","that","bad","smell","come","from","daybreak","+","god","be","behind","everyth","what","have","god","get","to","do","with","scifi","god","be","onli","the","answer","when","you","ca","not","think","up","a","sensibl","explan","for","someth","in","fact","thi","be","exactli","the","problem","with","the","seri","final","thei","obvious","can","not","think","up","sensibl","explan","for","the","multitud","of","big","question","that","be","rais","throughout","the","seri","such","a","how","kara","thrace","come","back","from","the","dead","in","a","brand","new","viper","how","her","old","viper","and","char","bodi","end","up","on","earth","why","baltar","have","a","imaginari","in","hi","head","why","have","a","imaginari","baltar","in","her","head","etc","so","thei","explain","it","with","angel","or","just","do","not","explain","it","at","allbr","br","the","plot","of","the","last","episod","have","hole","big","enough","to","fly","a","basestar","through","for","exampl","why","doe","galactica","and","it","crow","go","on","a","suicid","mission","to","rescu","on","girl","hera","particularli","after","adama","sai","there","be","no","wai","he","have","attempt","a","rescu","becaus","thei","find","out","the","locat","of","the","cylon","base","that","not","a","good","reason","to","sacrific","the","crow","live","and","how","do","ander","know","the","locat","and","what","be","the","point","of","the","flashback","to","the","major","charact","live","befor","the","war","it","like","thei","forget","to","do","it","earli","so","thei","throw","someth","in","at","the","last","momentbr","br","the","peopl","who","write","the","last","two","episod","can","not","have","be","the","same","writer","who","creat","what","have","be","so","far","a","sensat","seri","feel","like","the","script","write","be","take","over","by","evangel","christian","on","a","mission","to","spread","the","word","forget","try","to","tie","up","the","loos","end","in","the","plot","the","import","messag","the","writer","want","to","get","across","be","do","not","put","your","faith","in","technologi","a","it","will","lead","to","your","destruct","god","be","your","ultim","salvat","tough","luck","if","you","have","a","ill","that","ne","medic","treatmentbr","br","imagin","in","the","final","movi","of","the","star","war","seri","thei","tell","you","there","be","no","forc","instead","a","jedi","actual","get","hi","power","from","jesu","then","thei","fly","their","spaceship","into","the","near","star","and","go","live","in","the","forest","with","the","ewok","would","thi","be","a","good","end","no","it","frakken","would","not"],"filtered":["step","someth","bad","smell","come","daybreak","+","god","behind","everyth","god","get","scifi","god","onli","answer","ca","think","sensibl","explan","someth","fact","thi","exactli","problem","seri","final","thei","obvious","think","sensibl","explan","multitud","big","question","rais","throughout","seri","kara","thrace","come","back","dead","brand","new","viper","old","viper","char","bodi","end","earth","baltar","imaginari","hi","head","imaginari","baltar","head","etc","thei","explain","angel","explain","allbr","br","plot","last","episod","hole","big","enough","fly","basestar","exampl","doe","galactica","crow","go","suicid","mission","rescu","girl","hera","particularli","adama","sai","wai","attempt","rescu","becaus","thei","find","locat","cylon","base","good","reason","sacrific","crow","live","ander","know","locat","point","flashback","major","charact","live","befor","war","like","thei","forget","earli","thei","throw","someth","last","momentbr","br","peopl","write","last","two","episod","writer","creat","far","sensat","seri","feel","like","script","write","take","evangel","christian","mission","spread","word","forget","try","tie","loos","end","plot","import","messag","writer","want","get","across","put","faith","technologi","lead","destruct","god","ultim","salvat","tough","luck","ill","ne","medic","treatmentbr","br","imagin","final","movi","star","war","seri","thei","tell","forc","instead","jedi","actual","get","hi","power","jesu","thei","fly","spaceship","near","star","go","live","forest","ewok","thi","good","end","frakken"],"filtered2":["step","someth","bad","smell","come","daybreak","+","god","behind","everyth","god","get","scifi","god","onli","answer","ca","think","sensibl","explan","someth","fact","exactli","problem","final","obvious","think","sensibl","explan","multitud","big","question","rais","throughout","kara","thrace","come","back","dead","brand","new","viper","old","viper","char","bodi","end","earth","baltar","imaginari","head","imaginari","baltar","head","etc","explain","angel","explain","allbr","plot","last","hole","big","enough","fly","basestar","exampl","doe","galactica","crow","go","suicid","mission","rescu","girl","hera","particularli","adama","wai","attempt","rescu","becaus","find","locat","cylon","base","good","reason","sacrific","crow","live","ander","kno

{"value":"I always wrote this series off as being a complete stink-fest because Jim Belushi was involved in it, and heavily. But then one day a tragic happenstance occurred. After a White Sox game ended I realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow. Now I could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote, or even to the TV to turn the channel. But then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch TV in another state? \"Nuts to that\", I said. So I decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever Fate had in store for me. What Fate had in store was an episode of this show, an episode about which I remember very little except that I had once again made a very broad, general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with, and once again I was completely right! This show is a total crud-pie! Belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn. The women are physically attractive but too Stepford-is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer. There is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell. <br /><br />Except.. <br /><br />Except for the wonderful comic sty lings of Larry Joe Campbell, America's Greatest Comic Character Actor. This guy plays Belushi's brother-in-law, Andy, and he is gold. How good is he really? Well, aside from being funny, his job is to make Belushi look good. That's like trying to make butt warts look good. But Campbell pulls it off with style. Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery so he can win it every year. Without Larry Joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking Courtney Thorne-Smith smacking Belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage. 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell designated Comedic Bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he's

{"value":"Assassin Hauser's (John Cusak) mission is to whack a Mid-Eastern oil minister, whose name happens to be Omar Sharif (Neikov), in the country of Turaqistan which is run by American interests. Hauser poses as Trade Show producer to allow him to get to Omar.<br /><br />Sometimes a satire can be so overdone it becomes most annoying. Here it does too much: the government, politics, music, war, people not generally accepted by society, and did I mention \"war.\" And, that is what we have here - a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life. I am still asking myself why I continued with the DVD. Also, there are so many Cusak family members in this that John Cusak appears embarrassed by the family just being there, or is that just me?<br /><br />It used to be that a John Cusak movie, while a little offbeat, was, in the end, rather good. Not here. Believe that John Cusak had a hand in the writing and producing of this mess. Make of that what you will.<br /><br />There is too much going on in the movie accompanied by constant gun-fire, bombings, and shouting that you really cannot focus or was that the point? Probably. It just takes too long to set up the hit, which is largely forgotten until the last 15-minutes. In the meantime we have meaningless banter among all in the cast. And, chemistry between John Cusak and Marisa Tormei? I don't think so, but you know: the boy  girl thing and they needed something to take up more time. <br /><br />Yes, for what they were supposed to be, (offbeat and annoying) the performances of Duff, and Kingsley were good. But, when I saw Dan Aykroyd's character, in the beginning of the show, sitting on a toilet taking a dump, I knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well. I was not wrong. I am sure some will sing praises of this effort, but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so, too, is a mess<br /><br />I now remember why I continued with the DVD. I was hoping that the story would somehow level out and save itself. Never did.<br /><br />Violence: Yes.

{"value":"(Some possible spoilers)<br /><br /> I'm not too sure what Dreamworks was thinking when they decided to plunk $80 million down on this extremely tired and lame animated flick. They probably thought the spectacular animation would be more than enough to bring audiences (mostly families) to see it in droves. Well it seemed to work for the opening weekend, it made $26 mil., roughly and has made $38.1 mil. total (an estimation for this weekend). But I think audiences that came during the weekend saw pretty much the same thing I did, when I saw and they spread the word. This is one majorly lame movie, apart from the animation everything else, mostly the script seem to be done by a three year old.<br /><br /> The movie is only about 80 mins. long, but it feels like a three hour epic. A few sticking points for me are, well the irritating narration is one of them, and it's so obviously written. At one point he escapes from some captors and even though you can see the horse is obviously scared, up pops the narrator (the voice of the talented Matt Damon) to clear up any misconceptions (which would only happen in the simplest of mindsets.<br /><br /> Another one is the constant pop up of Bryan Adams songs, now I'm a fan of his music, I think he's good, but come on did Dreamworks really think audiences would be able to handle 8-9 of his songs throughout such a short movie, I certainly couldn't. Finally and here's a spoiler, a horse gets shot at point blank range by a member of the calvary, no less, she (the horse) then falls into a raging river, Spirit (the focus of the movie) tries to save her, but they both go over a waterfall that must have at least a 50 foot drop, well later in the movie near the end we see that this horse is alive and well. Now I know this is a kids movie, but even that little amount of realism is unacceptable.<br /><br /> To sum up, this is a really lame movie, I'm not saying kids won't enjoy it, but anyone else will be checking their watches just waiting for this tripe to end. Definitely on my Top 10 worst list of this year. -** out of 4 stars.<br /><br

{"value":"There's a good movie lurking here, but this isn't it. The basic idea is good: to explore the moral issues that would face a group of young survivors of the apocalypse. But the logic is so muddled that it's impossible to get involved.<br /><br />For example, our four heroes are (understandably) paranoid about catching the mysterious airborne contagion that's wiped out virtually all of mankind. Yet they wear surgical masks some times, not others. Some times they're fanatical about wiping down with bleach any area touched by an infected person. Other times, they seem completely unconcerned.<br /><br />Worse, after apparently surviving some weeks or months in this new kill-or-be-killed world, these people constantly behave like total newbs. They don't bother accumulating proper equipment, or food. They're forever running out of fuel in the middle of nowhere. They don't take elementary precautions when meeting strangers. And after wading through the rotting corpses of the entire human race, they're as squeamish as sheltered debutantes. You have to constantly wonder how they could have survived this long... and even if they did, why anyone would want to make a movie about them.<br /><br />So when these dweebs stop to agonize over the moral dimensions of their actions, it's impossible to take their soul-searching seriously. Their actions would first have to make some kind of minimal sense.<br /><br />On top of all this, we must contend with the dubious acting abilities of Chris Pine. His portrayal of an arrogant young James T Kirk might have seemed shrewd, when viewed in isolation. But in Carriers he plays on exactly that same note: arrogant and boneheaded. It's impossible not to suspect that this constitutes his entire dramatic range.<br /><br />On the positive side, the film *looks* excellent. It's got an over-sharp, saturated look that really suits the southwestern US locale. But that can't save the truly feeble writing nor the paper-thin (and annoying) characters. Even if you're a fan of the end-of-the-world genre, you should save yourself the agony of watching

{"value":"Believe it or not, \"The Woodchipper Massacre\" gave me full-blown gonorrhea! That's right, I've got a rainbow of discharge spewing from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the Devil and got distribution. It's beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate this pant-load of a film. The only reason I managed to sit through the whole thing (not without several suicide attempts along the way) was because, well first off, I was delirious with boredom, and second - I guess I wanted to further explore this newly discovered type of hate I was experiencing... This movie is a 'shot-on-video' \"horror/comedy\" about three siblings who are left for the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt. The youngest kid ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with his Rambo-replica hunting knife. They then get to dismembering auntie with various tools (apparently she didn't have a single drop of blood in her body!) and heave her into their dad's rented wood chipper... Her convict son then stops by looking for his mom and the kids end up grinding that jackass too... I don't recall ever seeing a cast of annoying actors that actually caused me nausea. Seriously, that one blond chick's voice had me wincing in pain constantly. ALL of the actors were downright atrocious - literally just screaming their phony sounding dialog and cracking jokes that must've been written by a chimp that just didn't care! Now, I can usually appreciate independent efforts, but only from those who can realize that people other than their relatives might be watching this! I don't need to see a 3 minute shot of a car pulling out of a drive-way and a torturous, painfully long lawn grooming montage with some ridiculous, fluttery music playing over it. Plus, why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it?! There WAS a piano in ONE scene and no one is killed near it! I'm through with reminiscing about this movie. Unless you like insufferable crap, I would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this

I've seen most, if not all of his movies but it was the first time seeing this one. Modern Romance is an interesting take on the subject of love. There are few movies that handle the desperation of love as well or as overtly as Modern Romance, although 1979's Chilly Scenes of Winter comes very close. They both essentially deal with obsessed men that are too psychologically attracted/obsessed to their respective women.<br /><br />Where-as Chilly Scenes of Winter borders on the subject stalking, this movie has a more grounded foundation with the subject of love because both people are already in a relationship.. and out of the relationship.. and back in it again.<br /><br />And because it's a movie that was released in 1981, it is of its time in terms of styles and such. That's the main reason I like this movie. My basic rule when it comes to movies is \"If it sucks at least it may have some historic relevance\", you know time capsule stuff.<br /><br />Which leads me to the horrific scenes of Albert Brooks sans shirt.<br /><br />The man is hair. Very hair. Like he's wearing a black curly fur sweater-hairy. And what's worse is he almost looks burn victim-hairy. It's not a pleasant sight and the scenes with him without a shirt go on and on. Back in the early 80's hairy men were seen as normal and nothing shocking. But in 2009 the sight of something like this is just plain revolting. Sorry, Albert! I wish at some point someone said \"hey let's try this scene but with you wearing a simple t-shirt, I mean you might scare people\". It's just really bad and I feel sorry for the poor pretty actress that had to deal with Albert Brooks naked body on top of hers. She was probably pulling out his hairs from her teeth for days after that.<br /><br />Anyway, it's an OK movie. It could have been better if I hadn't see Albert Brooks without his shirt for what seemed like 10 long continuous minutes because that will forever taint my viewing of this

{"value":"This movie tackles child abduction from the point of view of a Mom (lisa Hartman Black) who acts like a man would in an action thriller. Unlike other movies where the focus is on the Police, here the Mom is tracking down her ex-husband who kidnapped their son. She gets help from her lawyer who eventually falls in love with her.<br /><br />Before finally catching up with her son, a lot of bizarre things happen. The Mom tries to take a child that looks like her son from a local Children's Play at a community theater. She gets caught, and then realizes it is not her child. That alone would have gotten most people put into the Mental Ward or a few months in jail waiting for trial. However, in this movie the Mom is release after a couple of hours because the victim's parents feel sorry for her. A little while later Mom breaks into her mother-in-law's house and then the Police arrive and they have their guns aimed at her but they let her run away because they recognize her (and feel sorry for her?).<br /><br />At another point in the story they have found the child, but when the Police arrive to search the house it turns out they left out the back door and got into the river on a dinghy that apparently the Dad kept around just for such an emergency escape! The Mom gets someone to lend her a raft, and even though it must have taken some time (in a real world), she and the lawyer-boyfriend, and the Police catch up to the other raft pretty fast and it is upside down in the water by landfall. Instead of getting out of the raft to search for the Dad on the land, Mom presumes he drowned the boy and she jumps into the water when she sees his life-jacket. Of course, she cannot swim and sinks like a rock. The lawyer saves her, but they miss a chance to run after the Dad. At one point the Mom is told her son died at a Clinic in Mexico. On and on it goes, and where it stops nobody knows! In some ways, this movie really exploits child abduction and it is not very positive. On the other hand, seeing a woman do all the crazy things that men do in these kind of movies was fun (or funny?).","finished_norm":["thi","movi","tackl","child","abduct","from","the","point","of","view","of","a","mom","lisa","hartman","black","who","act","like","a","man","would","in","a","action","thriller","unlik","other","movi","where","the","focu","be","on","the","polic","here","the","mom","be","track","down","her","exhusband","who","kidnap","their","son","she","get","help","from","her","lawyer","who","eventu","fall","in","love","with","herbr","br","befor","final","catch","up","with","her","son","a","lot","of","bizarr","thing","happen","the","mom","try","to","take","a","child","that","look","like","her","son","from","a","local","child","plai","at","a","commun","theater","she","get","catch","and","then","realiz","it","be","not","her","child","that","alon","would","have","get","much","peopl","put","into","the","mental","ward","or","a","few","month","in","jail","wait","for","trial","howev","in","thi","movi","the","mom","be","releas","after","a","coupl","of","hour","becaus","the","victim","parent","feel","sorri","for","her","a","littl","while","late","mom","break","into","her","motherinlaw","hous","and","then","the","polic","arriv","and","thei","have","their","gun","aim","at","her","but","thei","let","her","run","awai","becaus","thei","recogn","her","and","feel","sorri","for","herbr","br","at","anoth","point","in","the","stori","thei","have","find","the","child","but","when","the","polic","arriv","to","search","the","hous","it","turn","out","thei","leav","out","the","back","door","and","get","into","the","river","on","a","dinghi","that","appar","the","dad","keep","around","just","for","such","a","emerg","escap","the","mom","get","someon","to","lend","her","a","raft","and","even","though","it","must","have","take","some","time","in","a","real","world","she","and","the","lawyerboyfriend","and","the","polic","catch","up","to","the","other","raft","pretti","fast","and","it","be","upsid","down","in","the","water","by","landfal","instead","of","get","out","of","the","raft","to","search","for","the","dad","on","the","land","mom","presum","he","drown","the","boi","and","she","jump","into","the","water","when","she","see","hi","lifejacket","of","cours","she","cannot","swim","and","sink","like","a","rock","the","lawyer","save","her","but","thei","miss","a","chanc","to","run","after","the","dad","at","on","point","the","mom","be","tell","her","son","die","at","a","clinic","in","mexico","on","and","on","it","go","and","where","it","stop","nobodi","know","in","some","wai","thi","movi","realli","exploit","child","abduct","and","it","be","not","veri","posit","on","the","other","hand","see","a","woman","do","all","the","crazi","thing","that","man","do","in","thi","kind","of","movi","be","fun","or","funni"],"filtered":["thi","movi","tackl","child","abduct","point","view","mom","lisa","hartman","black","act","like","man","action","thriller","unlik","movi","focu","polic","mom","track","exhusband","kidnap","son","get","help","lawyer","eventu","fall","love","herbr","br","befor","final","catch","son","lot","bizarr","thing","happen","mom","try","take","child","look","like","son","local","child","plai","commun","theater","get","catch","realiz","child","alon","get","much","peopl","put","mental","ward","month","jail","wait","trial","howev","thi","movi","mom","releas","coupl","hour","becaus","victim","parent","feel","sorri","littl","late","mom","break","motherinlaw","hous","polic","arriv","thei","gun","aim","thei","let","run","awai","becaus","thei","recogn","feel","sorri","herbr","br","anoth","point","stori","thei","find","child","polic","arriv","search","hous","turn","thei","leav","back","door","get","river","dinghi","appar","dad","keep","around","emerg","escap","mom","get","someon","lend","raft","even","though","must","take","time","real","world","lawyerboyfriend","polic","catch","raft","pretti","fast","upsid","water","landfal","instead","get","raft","search","dad","land","mom","presum","drown","boi","jump","water","see","hi","lifejacket","cours","swim","sink","like","rock","lawyer","save","thei","miss","chanc","run","dad","point","mom","tell","son","die","clinic","mexico","go","stop","nobodi","know","wai","thi","movi","realli","exploit","child","abduct","veri","posit","hand","see","woman","crazi","thing","man","thi","kind","movi","fun","funni"],"filtered2":["tackl","child","abduct","point","view","mom","lisa","hartman","black","act","like","man","action","thriller","unlik","focu","polic","mom","track","exhusband","kidnap","son","get","help","lawyer","eventu","fall","love","herbr","befor","final","catch","son","lot","bizarr","thing","happen","mom","try","take","child","look","like","son","local","child","plai","commun","theater","get","catch","realiz","child","alon","get","peopl","put","mental","ward","month","jail","wait","trial","howev","mom","releas","coupl","hour","becaus","victim","parent","feel","sorri","littl","late","mom","break","motherinlaw","hous","polic","arriv","gun","aim","let","run","awai","becaus","recogn","feel","sorri

{"value":"Geez, another Lifetime movie, but once again isn't exactly the worst movie in the world, but far from the best. I think the main problem is that it's pretty obvious who is responsible for what, and it's generally fairly predictable. Worse yet, some of the flashbacks ended up being confusing, and the viewer is left wondering \"Okay, how much am I supposed to care?\" One thing I did like is that the movie goes to show you that it's never THAT simple as \"the good guys are good and the bad guys are bad\", and sometimes it IS evil vs evil rather than good vs evil. Hadley didn't do what she did out of a sense of justice, she did it because she considered herself entitled to a job for being family, AND to eliminate the competition. As for Alicia, it simply proves that a victim isn't always a good person. Some of them really do \"have it coming\", even if \"it\" was a painful, horrible death. \"The Burning Bed\" is a great example of this, but the difference is that the vile man in \"The Burning Bed\" got exactly what he deserved. But, did Alicia \"have it coming\"? Some will say that she did, but others don't agree, and the law generally doesn't either.<br /><br />As for acting, it's a mixed bag. Some do a good job, like Mia, but others just came across as indifferent to their roles. They were mostly wooden or simply not convincing. The music was pretty cool though and some of the scenes are nice and steamy, especially if you like girl/girl action. The movie isn't badly shot at all, but given its glaring weaknesses, the strengths are in background, unfortunately.<br /><br />I've heard rumors of a sequel, but given the years, I doubt it'll happen. But, I wouldn't be surprised if a sequel suddenly appeared. If Alicia is as EVIL, conniving and horrible as people say, then I don't think she'll be thinking, \"YAY! I woke up from a coma! Oh, Hadley was responsible? Oh! That's okay!

{"value":"Lot of silly plot holes in the film. First we see him watching his master practice kung-fu, and die in the midst of his practice. That's fine with me. And then at the end of the film, we see him use the kung-fu that he learned just by watching his master when he was still a kid. Is that even possible? I don't think so.<br /><br />This show is purely for Jay Chou fans, and the film lacks a depth in terms of character development, cinematography styles and unfolding of plot.<br /><br />Anybody notice that the captain of the basket team (forgot his name) and the idolized player Li Xiao look so similar to each other, to the extent that you'd think they were the one and same person? Long hair, sunshine-boy look, tall and strong. The two of them looked like they came out from a mass production factory designed to churn out products that makes teenage girls scream wild in orgasm. Not that those two actors had anything of value to contribute to the movie as a whole for the movie industry at all.<br /><br />The jokes were lame and not funny at all.<br /><br />The scene with regards to the 4 masters of Jay Chou coming back to help him out in the basketball court, degenerated into a pointless plot when they started bashing their opponents ala Royal Rumble style. Worse of all, when the 4 masters won the fight, the crowd began cheering, and the match continued. It was truly a WTF? moment.<br /><br />At the end of the show, when they win the match, all thanks to Jay Chou's excellent kung fu skills. How he acquired those kung-fu skills is a mystery, because the show somehow shows him acquiring the skills just by observing his master.<br /><br />And then his long-lost father comes out of the woodwork to acknowledge Jay Chou as his long-lost son seemed just a tad too quick of the director to wrap up the film.<br /><br />In short, this is a Jay Chou-flick (instead of the usual \"chick flick\").

{"value":"THE CAT O'NINE TAILS (Il Gatto a Nove Code) <br /><br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (Cromoscope)<br /><br />Sound format: Mono<br /><br />(35mm and 70mm release prints)<br /><br />A blind ex-journalist (Karl Malden) overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter (James Franciscus) to investigate a series of murders at the lab, unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer.<br /><br />Rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE (1969), Dario Argento conceived THE CAT O'NINE TAILS as a giallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner, toplining celebrated Hollywood actor Karl Malden - fresh from his appearance in PATTON (1969) - and rising star Franciscus (THE VALLEY OF GWANGI). Sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than \"Bird\" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption.<br /><br />Malden and Franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (THE DEAD ARE ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which Argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving Euro starlet Catherine Spaak (THE LIBERTINE) as Franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart Franco Fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer's devious machinations. But despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil. It's no surprise that \"Cat\" failed to emulate the runaway success of \"Bird\" when released in 1971.<br /><br />(English

{"value":"After spotting the high rating on IMDb, I decided to go see this movie. Beyond that high rating, I intentionally avoided reading any of the reviews. I wanted to go into the theater with a clean slate, without knowing the plot or having predetermined expectations.<br /><br />Given my rating, you can see that I was disappointed. I enjoyed the development of the main character Mike Enslin. I also enjoyed how the hotel manager attempted to talk him out of entering the hotel room. By the time Enslin entered the room, I was ready for some scary stuff.<br /><br />First chocolates appear on the pillow and the toilet paper is folded. Enslin reacts in a believable manner. He's freaked out. I'm encouraged and think to myself, this is going to be good. The people who made this movie understand that less is more.<br /><br />But it's what happens next that was a big let down. The subtleness is quickly replaced by the predictable shotgun approach... Just blast the audience with every Hollywood scary trick in the book and hope that something works. Let's see, a clock radio that turns on by itself? Good, that's always scary. Objects that move around in the room? Good, you can't complain about that. Blood dripping from the walls and sink? Great. Ghosts that commit suicide? Good. Anything else? How about loud noises, shaking, fire, more shaking, messing up the room, more blood, etc etc. It's all good. And it's all been done before. Overstimulate our Attention Deficit Disordered audience with all kinds of stuff in quick succession, and they won't be able to look away.<br /><br />Well, it didn't work for me. And you know what else? When I go see a horror movie in a theater, it's typical to hear several groups of girls in the audience yelling in fear at scary moments. But this movie had no scary moments. The audience was silent and disinterested. I felt no chill down my spine. Nothing. The Shining was 100x what this movie tries to be.<br /><br />So who are all these people who are saying that it is one of the best horror movies ever? Friends of the director? Sorry, I just don't get it.","finished_norm":["after","spot","the","high","rate","on","imdb","i","decid","to","go","see","thi","movi","beyond","that","high","rate","i","intention","avoid","read","ani","of","the","review","i","want","to","go","into","the","theater","with","a","clean","slate","without","know","the","plot","or","have","predetermin","expectationsbr","br","give","my","rate","you","can","see","that","i","be","disappoint","i","enjoi","the","develop","of","the","main","charact","mike","enslin","i","conjur","enjoi","how","the","hotel","manag","attempt","to","talk","him","out","of","enter","the","hotel","room","by","the","time","enslin","enter","the","room","i","be","readi","for","some","scari","stuffbr","br","chocol","appear","on","the","pillow","and","the","toilet","paper","be","fold","enslin","react","in","a","believ","manner","he","freak","out","i","be","encourag","and","think","to","myself","thi","be","go","to","be","good","the","peopl","who","make","thi","movi","understand","that","littl","be","morebr","br","but","it","what","happen","next","that","be","a","big","let","down","the","subtl","be","quickli","replac","by","the","predict","shotgun","approach","just","blast","the","audienc","with","everi","hollywood","scari","trick","in","the","book","and","hope","that","someth","work","let","see","a","clock","radio","that","turn","on","by","itself","good","that","alwai","scari","object","that","move","around","in","the","room","good","you","ca","not","complain","about","that","blood","drip","from","the","wall","and","sink","great","ghost","that","commit","suicid","good","anyth","els","how","about","loud","nois","shake","fire","much","shake","mess","up","the","room","much","blood","etc","etc","it","all","good","and","it","all","be","do","befor","overstimul","our","attent","deficit","disord","audienc","with","all","kind","of","stuff","in","quick","success","and","thei","wo","not","be","abl","to","look","awaybr","br","good","it","do","not","work","for","me","and","you","know","what","els","when","i","go","see","a","horror","movi","in","a","theater","it","typic","to","hear","sever","group","of","girl","in","the","audienc","yell","in","fear","at","scari","moment","but","thi","movi","have","no","scari","moment","the","audienc","be","silent","and","disinterest","i","feel","no","chill","down","my","spine","noth","the","shine","be","x","what","thi","movi","try","to","bebr","br","so","who","be","all","thi","peopl","who","be","sai","that","it","be","on","of","the","well","horror","movi","ever","friend","of","the","director","sorri","i","just","do","not","get","it"],"filtered":["spot","high","rate","imdb","decid","go","see","thi","movi","beyond","high","rate","intention","avoid","read","ani","review","want","go","theater","clean","slate","without","know","plot","predetermin","expectationsbr","br","give","rate","see","disappoint","enjoi","develop","main","charact","mike","enslin","conjur","enjoi","hotel","manag","attempt","talk","enter","hotel","room","time","enslin","enter","room","readi","scari","stuffbr","br","chocol","appear","pillow","toilet","paper","fold","enslin","react","believ","manner","freak","encourag","think","thi","go","good","peopl","make","thi","movi","understand","littl","morebr","br","happen","next","big","let","subtl","quickli","replac","predict","shotgun","approach","blast","audienc","everi","hollywood","scari","trick","book","hope","someth","work","let","see","clock","radio","turn","good","alwai","scari","object","move","around","room","good","ca","complain","blood","drip","wall","sink","great","ghost","commit","suicid","good","anyth","els","loud","nois","shake","fire","much","shake","mess","room","much","blood","etc","etc","good","befor","overstimul","attent","deficit","disord","audienc","kind","stuff","quick","success","thei","wo","abl","look","awaybr","br","good","work","know","els","go","see","horror","movi","theater","typic","hear","sever","group","girl","audienc","yell","fear","scari","moment","thi","movi","scari","moment","audienc","silent","disinterest","feel","chill","spine","noth","shine","x","thi","movi","try","bebr","br","thi","peopl","sai","well","horror","movi","ever","friend","director","sorri","get"],"filtered2":["spot","high","rate","imdb","decid","go","see","beyond","high","rate","intention","avoid","read","ani","review","want","go","theater","clean","slate","without","know","plot","predetermin","expectationsbr","give","rate","see","disappoint","enjoi","develop","main","charact","mike","enslin","conjur","enjoi","hotel","manag","attempt","talk","enter","hotel","room","time","enslin","enter","room","readi","scari","stuffbr","chocol","appear","pillow","toilet","paper","fold","enslin","react","believ","manner","freak","encourag","think","go","good","peopl","make","understand","littl","morebr","happen","next","big","let","subtl","quickli","replac","predict","shotgun","approach","blast","audienc","everi","hollywood","scari","trick","book","hope","someth","work","let","see","clock","radio","turn","good",

{"value":"I got this movie out of Blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks. I'd have to say I got my money's worth on this one. I had expected horrible dialogue, crappy monsters, and shaky cameras. Well, as Meatloaf said, two outta three ain't bad.<br /><br />The acting is bad, though not as bad as some movies I've seen. Or maybe I've watched so many low budget movies recently I've lost perspective. There are some bits were the acting is downright terrible, but for the most part it's of at least High School Play level.<br /><br />The CG for the Sasquatch in this movie is probably the second-worst part. The first thing I thought when I saw it (and I noticed another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man in an ape suit would have been better. Clunky stop-motion animation would have looked better.<br /><br />So you may be asking why I call the CG the second-worst part. That's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects. They are loud, annoying, and constant. I've been camping, I know what insects sound like in the woods at night, and while they can be loud, they're not deafening like the cacophony in this movie. Usually when the \"background\" sounds drown out the movie's dialogue, it's a bad thing, but from what I caught of the dialogue of this film, I wasn't missing much.<br /><br />The action was infrequent and boring. The tension was non-existent, as was any sense of empathy with the characters. Speaking of the characters, they were all cookie-cutter and bland. The only mildly engaging byplay was between...actually, I can't think of anything. There was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile, but that was about it.<br /><br />The cinematography was decent, a step or two above what you'd normally see in a movie like this. However, it still had that \"home movie\" quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer. <br /><br />If you're like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks, and you see this one in the dollar bin, think about grabbing it. Otherwise, stay away at all costs.","finished_norm":["i","get","thi","movi","out","of","blockbust","in","on","of","that","rack","be","you","can","get","like","movi","for","buck","i","have","have","to","sai","i","get","my","monei","worth","on","thi","on","i","have","expect","horribl","dialogu","crappi","monster","and","shaki","camera","good","a","meatloaf","sai","two","outta","three","have","not","badbr","br","the","act","be","bad","though","not","a","bad","a","some","movi","i","have","see","or","mayb","i","have","watch","so","mani","low","budget","movi","recent","i","have","lose","perspect","there","be","some","bit","be","the","act","be","downright","terribl","but","for","the","much","part","it","of","at","littl","high","school","plai","levelbr","br","the","cg","for","the","sasquatch","in","thi","movi","be","probabl","the","secondworst","part","the","thing","i","think","when","i","see","it","and","i","notic","anoth","review","agre","with","me","be","that","a","man","in","a","ap","suit","would","have","be","well","clunki","stopmot","anim","would","have","look","betterbr","br","so","you","mai","be","ask","why","i","call","the","cg","the","secondworst","part","that","becaus","the","veri","wrong","part","of","the","movi","be","the","sound","effect","thei","be","loud","annoi","and","constant","i","have","be","camp","i","know","what","insect","sound","like","in","the","wood","at","night","and","while","thei","can","be","loud","thei","re","not","deafen","like","the","cacophoni","in","thi","movi","usual","when","the","background","sound","drown","out","the","movi","dialogu","it","a","bad","thing","but","from","what","i","catch","of","the","dialogu","of","thi","film","i","be","not","miss","muchbr","br","the","action","be","infrequ","and","bore","the","tension","be","nonexist","a","be","ani","sens","of","empathi","with","the","charact","speak","of","the","charact","thei","be","all","cookiecutt","and","bland","the","onli","mildli","engag","byplai","be","betweenactu","i","ca","not","think","of","anyth","there","be","a","line","or","two","that","make","me","crack","a","wan","smile","but","that","be","about","itbr","br","the","cinematographi","be","decent","a","step","or","two","abov","what","you","have","normal","see","in","a","movi","like","thi","howev","it","still","have","that","home","movi","qualiti","to","it","that","you","get","with","movi","make","on","pocket","chang","and","a","prayer","br","br","if","you","re","like","me","and","get","a","kick","out","of","shoestr","budget","genr","flick","and","you","see","thi","on","in","the","dollar","bin","think","about","grab","it","otherwis","stai","awai","at","all","cost"],"filtered":["get","thi","movi","blockbust","rack","get","like","movi","buck","sai","get","monei","worth","thi","expect","horribl","dialogu","crappi","monster","shaki","camera","good","meatloaf","sai","two","outta","three","badbr","br","act","bad","though","bad","movi","see","mayb","watch","mani","low","budget","movi","recent","lose","perspect","bit","act","downright","terribl","much","part","littl","high","school","plai","levelbr","br","cg","sasquatch","thi","movi","probabl","secondworst","part","thing","think","see","notic","anoth","review","agre","man","ap","suit","well","clunki","stopmot","anim","look","betterbr","br","mai","ask","call","cg","secondworst","part","becaus","veri","wrong","part","movi","sound","effect","thei","loud","annoi","constant","camp","know","insect","sound","like","wood","night","thei","loud","thei","re","deafen","like","cacophoni","thi","movi","usual","background","sound","drown","movi","dialogu","bad","thing","catch","dialogu","thi","film","miss","muchbr","br","action","infrequ","bore","tension","nonexist","ani","sens","empathi","charact","speak","charact","thei","cookiecutt","bland","onli","mildli","engag","byplai","betweenactu","ca","think","anyth","line","two","make","crack","wan","smile","itbr","br","cinematographi","decent","step","two","abov","normal","see","movi","like","thi","howev","still","home","movi","qualiti","get","movi","make","pocket","chang","prayer","br","br","re","like","get","kick","shoestr","budget","genr","flick","see","thi","dollar","bin","think","grab","otherwis","stai","awai","cost"],"filtered2":["get","blockbust","rack","get","like","buck","get","monei","worth","expect","horribl","dialogu","crappi","monster","shaki","camera","good","meatloaf","two","outta","three","badbr","act","bad","though","bad","see","mayb","watch","mani","low","budget","recent","lose","perspect","bit","act","downright","terribl","part","littl","high","school","plai","levelbr","cg","sasquatch","probabl","secondworst","part","thing","think","see","notic","anoth","review","agre","man","ap","suit","well","clunki","stopmot","anim","look","betterbr","mai","ask","call","cg","secondworst","part","becaus","veri","wrong","part","sound","effect","loud","annoi","constant","camp","know","insect","sound","like","wood","night","loud","re","deafen","like","cacophoni","usual","background","sound","drown","dialogu","bad","t

{"value":"54 is a film about a club with that very title in the setting of the 70s era. It features the classic good-looking bartender. The sexy females. The high powered owner. The partying. When all entwined together chaos ensues, and the bartender (played by Phillipe) seems to be at the brunt of it all.<br /><br />I'm going to be as blunt and honest as possible, whilst avoiding any outright unfair or untrue comments (like, it's an 'ok' film). I really do find it a completely dire film complimented by it's dire cast. Every time I sit down to watch a film casting Salma Hayek, I am always awaiting to see her beauty, radiantly expressed simultaneously with a great performance, but, reality invariably reminds me quite abruptly how utterly talentless she is. I mean, really, what has she ever bequeathed the masses with, other than her immense table dance in 'From Dusk Till Dawn'...? The same goes for Ryan Phillippe, another poor actor who gives nothing to the screen but his good looks and insanely dull facade otherwise known as 'acting'. Mike Myers, isn't quite as bad as these 2, he does at least give the Film something worthy. Playing the seedy, extroverted co-founder of the 54 Club. The type that the majority watching would hate (i.e. job well done), he puts in a somewhat convincing performance that gave me rare enjoyment from the flick. But alas, it is not enough to rescue the film from it's baseless and flat nothingness. Most 'bad' bad films I find something to take from the film, but this has nothing to it, really. Neve Campbell isn't too bad, but she is just 'there'. The storyline is dull, it appears the writer was more bent on making a film of this style and embellishment and forgot to add anything else. Any meaning. Any class. Anything at all. Because like most ornaments, they are just hollow pointless objects, that are merely pretty to look at, much akin to the basis of this disastrous film.<br /><br />Genuinely an hour and a half of time I could have spent better doing something much more exciting, like talking to 90 year old relatives on the phone about the

{"value":"Certainly NOMAD has some of the best horse riding scenes, swordplay, and scrumptious landscape cinematography you'll likely see, but this isn't what makes a film good. It helps but the story has to shine through on top of these things. And that's where Nomad wanders.<br /><br />The story is stilted, giving it a sense that it was thrown together simply to make a \"cool\" movie that \"looks\" great. Not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place (and it's blatantly obvious with names like Lee and Hernandez). If movie makers want to engross us in a culture like the Jugars and the Kazaks, they damn well better use actors/actresses that look the part.<br /><br />Warring tribes, a prophecy, brotherly love and respect, a love interest that separates our \"heroes\", are all touched on but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush them aside in favor of the next battle sequence, the next action horse scene, or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape.<br /><br />It is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to Nomad during its filming, specifically the director and cinematographer. Ivan Passer (director) was replaced by Sergei Bodrov, and Ueli Steiger (cinematographer) was replaced by Dan Laustsen. In one respect, Laustsen seems to have the better eye since his visions of the lands made the final cut that we see here. Definitely a good thing. However, the changing over to Bodrov as director may not have been the wisest choice. From what I'm seeing here, the focus is on the battles and not the people, which I sense comes from Bodrov's eyes and not Passer's. A true travesty.<br /><br />The most shameful aspect is that this could've been a really fantastic film, with both character and action focuses. Unfortunately, the higher-ups apparently decided that action was what was needed and took the cheap (intellectually speaking) way out.<br /><br />Even though I can't give this film a positive rating, it is worth watching simply for the amazing cinematography work. But that's all.","finished_norm":["certainli","nomad","have","some","of","the","well","hors","ride","scene","swordplai","and","scrumptiou","landscap","cinematographi","you","will","like","see","but","thi","be","not","what","make","a","film","good","it","help","but","the","stori","have","to","shine","through","on","top","of","thi","thing","and","that","where","nomad","wandersbr","br","the","stori","be","stilt","give","it","a","sens","that","it","be","throw","togeth","simpli","to","make","a","cool","movi","that","look","great","not","to","mention","that","mani","of","the","main","charact","be","not","from","the","region","in","which","thi","stori","take","place","and","it","blatantli","obviou","with","name","like","lee","and","hernandez","if","movi","maker","want","to","engross","u","in","a","cultur","like","the","jugar","and","the","kazak","thei","damn","good","well","us","actorsactress","that","look","the","partbr","br","war","tribe","a","propheci","brotherli","love","and","respect","a","love","interest","that","separ","our","hero","be","all","touch","on","but","with","so","littl","impact","and","screen","time","that","much","viewer","will","brush","them","asid","in","favor","of","the","next","battl","sequenc","the","next","action","hors","scene","or","the","breathtak","beauti","of","the","landscapebr","br","it","be","worth","mention","that","there","be","some","signific","chang","make","to","nomad","dure","it","film","specif","the","director","and","cinematograph","ivan","passer","director","be","replac","by","sergei","bodrov","and","ueli","steiger","cinematograph","be","replac","by","dan","laustsen","in","on","respect","laustsen","seem","to","have","the","well","ey","sinc","hi","vision","of","the","land","make","the","final","cut","that","we","see","here","definit","a","good","thing","howev","the","chang","over","to","bodrov","a","director","mai","not","have","be","the","wise","choic","from","what","i","be","see","here","the","focu","be","on","the","battl","and","not","the","peopl","which","i","sens","come","from","bodrov","ey","and","not","passer","a","true","travestybr","br","the","much","shame","aspect","be","that","thi","can","have","be","a","realli","fantast","film","with","both","charact","and","action","focu","unfortun","the","higherup","appar","decid","that","action","be","what","be","ne","and","take","the","cheap","intellectu","speak","wai","outbr","br","even","though","i","ca","not","give","thi","film","a","posit","rate","it","be","worth","watch","simpli","for","the","amaz","cinematographi","work","but","that","all"],"filtered":["certainli","nomad","well","hors","ride","scene","swordplai","scrumptiou","landscap","cinematographi","like","see","thi","make","film","good","help","stori","shine","top","thi","thing","nomad","wandersbr","br","stori","stilt","give","sens","throw","togeth","simpli","make","cool","movi","look","great","mention","mani","main","charact","region","thi","stori","take","place","blatantli","obviou","name","like","lee","hernandez","movi","maker","want","engross","u","cultur","like","jugar","kazak","thei","damn","good","well","us","actorsactress","look","partbr","br","war","tribe","propheci","brotherli","love","respect","love","interest","separ","hero","touch","littl","impact","screen","time","much","viewer","brush","asid","favor","next","battl","sequenc","next","action","hors","scene","breathtak","beauti","landscapebr","br","worth","mention","signific","chang","make","nomad","dure","film","specif","director","cinematograph","ivan","passer","director","replac","sergei","bodrov","ueli","steiger","cinematograph","replac","dan","laustsen","respect","laustsen","seem","well","ey","sinc","hi","vision","land","make","final","cut","see","definit","good","thing","howev","chang","bodrov","director","mai","wise","choic","see","focu","battl","peopl","sens","come","bodrov","ey","passer","true","travestybr","br","much","shame","aspect","thi","realli","fantast","film","charact","action","focu","unfortun","higherup","appar","decid","action","ne","take","cheap","intellectu","speak","wai","outbr","br","even","though","ca","give","thi","film","posit","rate","worth","watch","simpli","amaz","cinematographi","work"],"filtered2":["certainli","nomad","well","hors","ride","scene","swordplai","scrumptiou","landscap","cinematographi","like","see","make","good","help","stori","shine","top","thing","nomad","wandersbr","stori","stilt","give","sens","throw","togeth","simpli","make","cool","look","great","mention","mani","main","charact","region","stori","take","place","blatantli","obviou","name","like","lee","hernandez","maker","want","engross","u","cultur","like","jugar","kazak","damn","good","well","us","actorsactress","look","partbr","war","tribe","propheci","brotherli","love","respect","love","interest","separ","hero","touch","littl","impact","screen","time","viewer","brush","asid","favor","next","battl","sequenc","next","action","hors","scene","breathtak","beauti","landscapebr","worth","mention","signific","chang","

{"value":"Let me start by saying that I totally agree with the basic thesis of the film, that there probably was no historical Jesus and Christianity is a sham. With that said, this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that thesis. It makes good arguments--the gap between Jesus' theoretical life and the writing of the Gospels, filled only by the writings of Paul, who doesn't indicate a historical Jesus--and then utterly fails to convincingly argue them. It makes broad statements without presenting the evidence the statements are based on, and it resolutely ignores counter-arguments presented by Christian apologists. The intellectual dishonesty, emotional manipulation, and lack of serious argument are obvious, and stunning. The only Christians we hear from in the film are the head of the filmmaker's old school--who comes off like a reasonable, rational person attempting to deal with a twit with a chip on his shoulder--and various Christians encountered apparently at random in a parking lot. I'm sorry, but revealing that average Christians don't know much about their religion isn't exactly damning evidence of Christianity's fraudulence. You may as well claim that Jay Leno has disproved the existence of Michael Dukakis on his Jay-Walking segment. The interviews with experts can be interesting, but the film is filled with too much of, let's be honest, the filmmaker just being snarky. Within the first five minutes the film has already conflated Jerry Falwell with Charles Manson and the writers of the Left Behind series with the Branch Davidians. And by the end, the film becomes so self-centered that there's no rational argument left, just an angry former Christian lashing out at the people and places he blames for his messed up childhood. Y'know, maybe that movie could've been interesting, but it's misplaced in a documentary about the historicity of Jesus, and it's so self-congratulatory as to deflate any sympathy. This is a Michael Moore film without the humor or the film-making acumen combined with a Richard Dawkins book without the wit or the intellectual rigor.

{"value":"After seeing the low-budget shittier versions of the \"Universal Soldier\" franchise, I hoped and prayed that Van Damme reprised his role as Luc Devoreaux in a second Unisol movie. Well, it seemed this prayer was answered, but not the way I hoped. Universial Soldier 2 is just intense as poetry reading at your local library. No, even that would be more intriguing . The fight sequences are top-notch, Bruce Lee quality, which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture. That and having former WCW tough-guy legend \"Goldberg\" playing the villain. However, placing Goldberg as Seth's sidekick lieutenant would've been better.<br /><br />We offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself. It's like some film school students slapped it together. The plot holes are that bigger than Kanye West's ego is what really did this movie in. For example: Luc's daughter, Hillary looks like she's at least 11-13 years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago. How is that possible? Tell me that! The part in which Luc's partner was killed off and turned into a Unisol is just re-goddamn diculous! You mean to tell me that there was an experimental Unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie. C'mon. The director could've spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut. But oooh nooo! <br /><br />Speaking of the plot, IT SUCKS! Compared to the first movie, Universal Soldier 2's plot watered down and worthless. Where's the gritty thrills in which a Unisol goes berserk an re-enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its Desert Storm or something ? This was the dawn of the Millennium, you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia/Orwellian type of future cesspit. Corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad, sad, sad sequel. <br /><br />From what I seen: Double Impact, Under Siege 2, Robocop 3, and hell, even the cheap-ass/no class Terminator knock-off

{"value":"Well, maybe I'm just having a bad run with Hindi movies lately. I asked the video store guy for Apharan (Prakash Jha) but being a new release, wasn't available yet. So I had to settle for this one. It turned out to be the stupidest Hindi movie I've seen (and I've seen quite a few). No wonder BOllywood is the laughing stock of the whole world! If IMDb had negative ratings, I would give Garam Masala a -10.<br /><br />I remember seeing a TV show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in Mumbai. All the usual celebs and their sideys showed up. For some strange reason, people expect good stuff from Piyadarashan. I did not like Hulchul, Hungama, or his other films. Hulchul, probably dubbed from Tamil or Telugu, came across as very loud, in-your-face fare that again didn't make much sense except in a Bollywood flick. This latest piece of utter CXXP proved that this guy has NO BRAINS. Who made him a director, even a Bollywood director at that??? <br /><br />Anyhow, to the film now. What starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non-sensical woman-hunt. Two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment (isn't it similar to No Entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office? Jezuz Christ, now they're copying their own stories!) Well anyways, there's some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi-lateral love (aka multi-tasking + multi-timing). What happened in the end, I've no idea. I switched off mid-way. What ridiculous junk. I can't believe they even released it. And how sadistic to wallow in their own filth! For which audience did they make it - the poor illiterate Indian masses (700 Mil at last count) or the well-heeled NRI desis staying in Phoren? Either ways it doesn't matter. Neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god-awful stuff.<br /><br />Its a short review because there's nothing to write about but the usual bag of F-grade garbage. Bollywood should change its name to Follywood. And yes, this review is much better than the movie

{"value":"I just finished \"Dark Chamber\" aka \"Under Surveillance\" and I'm stunned. Stunned, not by the film, but by some of the rave reviews I perused which influenced my watching it. The story was so ravaged by plot-holes and the majority of the acting so flat, categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate. Seriously, I found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as I endured this movie.<br /><br />Justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer-addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite Mom's warnings that Dad is no good. When a young woman is found murdered, Justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments. With the help of a couple pals, he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks. As the truth begins to unravel, Justin uncovers an unexpected secret.<br /><br />One positive point is that Felissa Rose is HOT! I would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit, but no such luck. It would have been the film's potential saving grace. Eric Conley played Justin very adeptly, I thought, and I wouldn't be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future. <br /><br />The general premise of the film, although plagued by clichés, might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow \"performances\" of key cast members, most notably Alexandra Eitel (Kayla) and David H. Rigg (Justin's father). The horror! (pardon the pun).<br /><br />I have nothing against low-budget films. Indeed, I believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come. I'll cut low-budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects, lighting, even musical score and the overall picture quality. I don't give allowances, however, for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lover's script. There are a vast number of competently-made low budget films out there. Sadly, this isn't one of them. I can't help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised \"Dark Chamber\" here are in some way affiliated with its

The clichés come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script is!<br /><br />In a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of Die Hard only set on a mountain (complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid) we have all the usual action move cliché's ticked off progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off.<br /><br />Jack Wild is the cop in full on John McClane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point.<br /><br />In amidst this mess, there are a few well known recognisable faces who I can only assume needed the cash and/or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects.<br /><br />Looking up this three quid from the Supermarket bargain bin effort on IMDb I am astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels, I have got to find these gems on DVD! It looks like the first sequel is a rip off of Under Siege 2 and the second sequel, well goodness knows! One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing Jack changes with each film and even the character's name seems to change for the third instalment.<br /><br />Still, blind purchases of cheap DVD's just would not be the same if studios didn't keep trotting out material of this awful
