{"value":"Harsh, yes, but I call 'em like I see 'em.<br /><br />I saw this in the late 80's, and it was truly one of the most awful, boring films I've ever forced myself to watch.<br /><br />Yes, the cinematography is lovely. The Czech settings are truly stunning. The political backdrop is enticing, but unlike similar \"historically set\" stories (e.g. _Dr. Zhivago_ (qv)), this one failed to make the politics relevant to the story, or even interesting.<br /><br />Sure, Olin and Binoche are beautiful. But this film manages to make even \"erotic\" scenes plodding and slow. I'm all for romance, but this movie was so boring, I started hoping the Russians would shoot them all and put an end to my misery.<br /><br />I'm sure if I'd read the book, the story would have made a bit more sense.

{"value":"I just finished watching \"El Otro\". I have always taken my hat off to Julio Chavez's performances, as he is a great actor, but this movie is really depressing and slow. I guess that it would have been even worse if it wasn't for Julio. Anyways, this is definitely a film that you will never understand if you are not from Argentina, and even if you are, I would advise you not to rent this movie in order to have a nice time with your girlfriend, boyfriend, family or friends... it is really depressing and incredibly slow, and the plot does not make a lot of sense neither. Probably the director wanted to show the fragility of the human life, but what he does is bore and impress the audience with scenes that shock you a little bit. It gives you something to think about, but not in a good way.

Gooooooodddd!!!!I hate this film so much that when I was watching it I laughed at all the serious parts,because they were so corny and unprofessional....and they couldn't have made the shark look more unrealistic,even though this \"thing\" had a bit larger budget than most low-budget movies.All I have to say is watch this movie expecting to laugh at all the bad acting,and stupid corny

{"value":"I know that movies aren't necessarily supposed to mirror reality, but this one got on my nerves. It perpetuates ignorant stereotypes about \"psychological trauma\" and mental illness. The \"psycho mom\" thing has been done too many times before (and usually done better) and much of the rest of the plot is far-fetched as well. The acting was not horrible but nothing to rave about.<br /><br />One highlight: I am a long-time fan of General Hospital and it was a trip to see one of the roles played by former GH regular, Jon Lindstrom.<br /><br />Anyway, if you can overlook the bogus psychoanalytical part of it, in the same way a person must suspend reality / judgment when watching a lot of movies, then this movie might be tolerable. If you have nothing better to do and fairly low standards.<br /><br />I'm sorry I spent my time watching it.","finished_norm":["i","know","that","movi","be","not","necessarili","suppos","to","mirror","realiti","but","thi","on","get","on","my","nerv","it","perpetu","ignor","stereotyp","about","psycholog","trauma","and","mental","ill","the","psycho","mom","thing","have","be","do","too","mani","time","befor","and","usual","do","well","and","much","of","the","rest","of","the","plot","be","farfetch","a","good","the","act","be","not","horribl","but","noth","to","rave","aboutbr","br","on","highlight","i","be","a","longtim","fan","of","gener","hospit","and","it","be","a","trip","to","see","on","of","the","role","plai","by","former","gh","regular","jon","lindstrombr","br","anywai","if","you","can","overlook","the","bogu","psychoanalyt","part","of","it","in","the","same","wai","a","person","must","suspend","realiti","judgment","when","watch","a","lot","of","movi","then","thi","movi","mai","be","toler","if","you","have","noth","well","to","do","and","fairli","low","standardsbr","br","i","be","sorri","i","spend","my","time","watch","it"],"filtered":["know","movi","necessarili","suppos","mirror","realiti","thi","get","nerv","perpetu","ignor","stereotyp","psycholog","trauma","mental","ill","psycho","mom","thing","mani","time","befor","usual","well","much","rest","plot","farfetch","good","act","horribl","noth","rave","aboutbr","br","highlight","longtim","fan","gener","hospit","trip","see","role","plai","former","gh","regular","jon","lindstrombr","br","anywai","overlook","bogu","psychoanalyt","part","wai","person","must","suspend","realiti","judgment","watch","lot","movi","thi","movi","mai","toler","noth","well","fairli","low","standardsbr","br","sorri","spend","time","watch"],"filtered2":["know","necessarili","suppos","mirror","realiti","get","nerv","perpetu","ignor","stereotyp","psycholog","trauma","mental","ill","psycho","mom","thing","mani","time","befor","usual","well","rest","plot","farfetch","good","act","horribl","noth","rave","aboutbr","highlight","longtim","fan","gener","hospit","trip","see","role","plai","former","gh","regular","jon","lindstrombr","anywai","overlook","bogu","psychoanalyt","part","wai","person","must","suspend","realiti","judgment","watch","lot","mai","toler","noth","well","fairli","low","standardsbr","sorri","spend","time","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,7,8,20,21,26,29,32,33,40,46,49,50,61,72,79,128,140,141,149,153,217,225,226,230,265,283,386,437,604,656,763,819,911,1040,1043,1121,1143,1385,1489,1673,1725,1759,1848,1853,2153,2267,2435,2567,2696,2948,3479,3680,4214,4245,4917,5793,5871],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,7,8,20,21,26,29,32,33,40,46,49,50,61,72,79,128,140,141,149,153,217,225,226,230,265,283,386,437,604,656,763,819,911,1040,1043,1121,1143,1385,1489,1673,1725,1759,1848,1853,2153,2267,2435,2567,2696,2948,3479,3680,4214,4245,4917,5793,5871],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,1.9218995441445863,1.8837873718108231,2.330690080046114,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.6284968758320737,1.655771293751733,3.3840606616174704,1.717994385570355,1.8818517047392527,1.9209463754160525,1.9469506069506084,2.3409902041158843,2.317169775997098,2.2657547357741192,2.3253197803590226,2.3409902041158843,2.6113665294700725,2.641219492619754,2.5940874818617203,2.7121382192999195,2.73529586597515,2.7678802023081546,3.0433232530252132,3.1952392950510555,3.5727776966246974,7.36198256252986,3.7465885637507435,3.835141961092188,3.969732115064953,4.105687751300982,4.115443926246347,4.403125998698128,4.436351646326448,4.403125998698128,4.5432147918688095,4.654440426979034,4.789173020949191,4.751432692966343,4.900964426937307,5.051537285416681,5.185068678041204,5.051537285416681,5.129498826886393,5.444579873526289,5.290429193699031,5.373120909544144,5.626901430320244,5.672363804397,5.9370563586240825,5.9370563586240825,6.101359409915359,6.389041482367141,6.389041482367141]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.884376267340919E-5,5.8446965425153675E-5,5.890133484928032E-5,5.856100230902424E-5,5.856196176511475E-5,5.848010384548317E-5,5.865403186814047E-5,5.845538140627099E-5,5.858681041318624E-5,6.499886802546214E-5,0.6357984162950601,5.836102153269325E-5,5.9450301058541156E-5,6.02983726665143E-5,5.840357778077857E-5,5.824217549056361E-5,5.9694953703192E-5,5.865952730818732E-5,5.847753635322506E-5,5.852600383373296E-5,5.9092277247015726E-5,5.8717644056102105E-5,5.878450300170402E-5,5.884783671047061E-5,5.9299463624330044E-5,5.898934412365142E-5,6.146914408732703E-5,5.837837172928483E-5,5.8379933487443585E-5,5.852783871879458E-5,5.977183422924722E-5,5.8656128489488935E-5,6.29623850718731E-5,5.8821119523244944E-5,5.844191396156784E-5

{"value":"We all know that countless duds have graced the 80s slasher genre and often deserve nothing but our deepest disgust. Maybe that's a bit hastey but damn if \"Slaughter High\" wasn't terribly unoriginal, even for a slasher flick. Pretty much, the plot involves a kid who experienced a Carrie-like shower humiliation in high school and returns to the dilapidated building to seek out revenge on a group of former-bullies who all show up to reminisce. As you'd expect, they are killed off steadily by a masked madman on April 1st by means of electrocution, burning, hanging, and chemically altered beer. I've got a number of problems with the plot details and settings of this movie, but considering the ending, I feel the need to discard my complaints and just say that this is a complete waste of time.

{"value":"Interesting story about a soldier in a war who misses out on saving the life of a young girl from the enemy and is haunted by this event, even though he did save many other captive children. The film flashes a head and this soldier is now a teacher in a high school that is managed mostly by policemen patrolling the hallways, bathrooms and even class rooms. In other words, the High School is a prison and most of the kids pay very little attention to their teachers or principal. Dolph Lundgren,(Sam Decker) plays the soldier/school teacher and decides he is going to quit teaching and go into another field. However, the principal asks him to have a Detention Class as his last duty as a teacher. It is at this point in the film when all Hell breaks loose and the story becomes a complete BOMB.

{"value":"Plot: an amorous couple decide to engage in some extra-marital hijinks in a flashy car. They then become stuck (literally) in a Compromising Position, while said car wanders aimlessly about the countryside until the hapless couple are rescued by the authorities.<br /><br />That's it. That's the entire movie. There may have been some dialogue here and there, but nothing comes to mind. It should be obvious by now that this movie is not just pointless, but actually physically painful to watch. The fact that it starred two of the UKs best up-and-coming actors (one of whom is now sadly deceased) only adds to the horror.<br /><br />Ian Charleson was outstanding in the very much deserved Oscar-winning 'Chariots of Fire'.

{"value":"That's right, you heard me this movie is a freaking' ABOMINATION. First off, the band, who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called \"THE NAKED BROTHERS BAND\"?!?! Not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians, they can't even play anything! Also, the lead singer sounds more girly than Geddy Lee, and even more his voice is horrible! Not only are they terrible musicians but they're terrible actors. Led by a crappy director and thin plot, this has got to be the dumbest movie ever. I wish this website would let you use a vote of ZERO OR BELOW out of 10, because giving this filth a 1/10 is being WAY too generous.<br /><br />I'm not sure that you can call this a comedy film.

Too much silence (it was interesting for an hour, but two hours of hearing steps and moaning from time to time, really...), too much boredom (no movie should ever be boring, no matter how deep it was to be!), too much porn-like scenes (I do get it really, I get that they were filming a porn movie there, but really, REALLY, really that is too much) I truly think, that cinema should be for watching

{"value":"Wow it's ironic since this movie has been out for awhile I think that someone else JUST reviewed it a couple days ago.<br /><br />Anyways, I watched this movie simply because it has Nick Stahl, for the record.<br /><br />The movie was ridiculous. The characters drove me INSANE, they were SO Cliché and STEREOTYPED. This movie had some of the worst dialogue I have ever heard. It had way too many plot twists too.<br /><br />There is ONE scene in the movie worth seeing however, the scene: \"Warm heart, cold gun\" where Nick Stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower. (Well, actually they were all obnoxious.) But his acting in that scene was excellent. The look on his face, it reminded my of American Psycho (a good movie). The scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for, do yourself a favor and don't watch it.","finished_norm":["wow","it","iron","sinc","thi","movi","have","be","out","for","awhil","i","think","that","someon","els","just","review","it","a","coupl","dai","agobr","br","anywai","i","watch","thi","movi","simpli","becaus","it","have","nick","stahl","for","the","recordbr","br","the","movi","be","ridicul","the","charact","drive","me","insan","thei","be","so","cliché","and","stereotyp","thi","movi","have","some","of","the","wrong","dialogu","i","have","ever","hear","it","have","wai","too","mani","plot","twist","toobr","br","there","be","on","scene","in","the","movi","worth","see","howev","the","scene","warm","heart","cold","gun","where","nick","stahl","kill","the","obnoxi","girl","in","the","shower","good","actual","thei","be","all","obnoxi","but","hi","act","in","that","scene","be","excel","the","look","on","hi","face","it","remind","my","of","american","psycho","a","good","movi","the","scene","be","worth","see","but","not","worth","see","the","rest","of","the","movi","for","do","yourself","a","favor","and","do","not","watch","it"],"filtered":["wow","iron","sinc","thi","movi","awhil","think","someon","els","review","coupl","dai","agobr","br","anywai","watch","thi","movi","simpli","becaus","nick","stahl","recordbr","br","movi","ridicul","charact","drive","insan","thei","cliché","stereotyp","thi","movi","wrong","dialogu","ever","hear","wai","mani","plot","twist","toobr","br","scene","movi","worth","see","howev","scene","warm","heart","cold","gun","nick","stahl","kill","obnoxi","girl","shower","good","actual","thei","obnoxi","hi","act","scene","excel","look","hi","face","remind","american","psycho","good","movi","scene","worth","see","worth","see","rest","movi","favor","watch"],"filtered2":["wow","iron","sinc","awhil","think","someon","els","review","coupl","dai","agobr","anywai","watch","simpli","becaus","nick","stahl","recordbr","ridicul","charact","drive","insan","cliché","stereotyp","wrong","dialogu","ever","hear","wai","mani","plot","twist","toobr","scene","worth","see","howev","scene","warm","heart","cold","gun","nick","stahl","kill","obnoxi","girl","shower","good","actual","obnoxi","act","scene","excel","look","face","remind","american","psycho","good","scene","worth","see","worth","see","rest","favor","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,10,12,16,19,21,22,25,32,33,44,50,52,76,84,113,132,139,162,176,196,201,216,219,223,226,248,251,253,274,386,435,461,501,523,580,604,614,644,1003,1107,1115,1246,1285,1443,1519,1725,1820,1922,2718,3693,6602,7013],"values":[3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,7,10,12,16,19,21,22,25,32,33,44,50,52,76,84,113,132,139,162,176,196,201,216,219,223,226,248,251,253,274,386,435,461,501,523,580,604,614,644,1003,1107,1115,1246,1285,1443,1519,1725,1820,1922,2718,3693,6602,7013],"values":[1.967100616408184,1.357228929984541,1.9218995441445863,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.1966138720291084,5.24952271204694,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.604729392502474,1.717994385570355,1.7122153074726136,2.1337665533324026,2.2212694515902225,2.1521782565202803,2.253494045787767,2.2939035841256437,2.3586007221245198,2.5040471493269134,2.478925055209576,2.561435818751577,2.6070186965339692,7.7376282535066245,2.825563294794476,2.5940874818617203,2.689504733779216,2.6942272927333892,2.7073305177318163,2.748952192422636,3.0433232530252132,3.2829611516442836,3.358217889001879,3.5119855004467477,3.4986697244709752,3.5039747767006686,3.5727776966246974,3.553030933689863,3.5670958631572662,4.035401218572811,4.213208095012239,4.1554492608600455,4.315570107673808,4.449957298382227,9.801928853874614,9.147503031457783,4.789173020949191,4.8184434032493035,5.064116067623542,5.274680836730892,5.672363804397,6.543192162194399,13.589013180950609]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[6.479590617502071E-5,6.435897223163629E-5,6.485930187129429E-5,6.448454413411266E-5,6.448560064076681E-5,6.439546265775631E-5,6.458698378633978E-5,6.436823950310351E-5,6.451296277051289E-5,7.157361057000523E-5,0.8363908030730876,6.426433497291627E-5,6.546379691669009E-5,6.639765236446142E-5,6.431119585557942E-5,6.413346745790292E-5,6.5733196579255E-5,6.459303509919755E-5,6.4392635459428E-5,6.444600550540822E-5,6.506955840701524E-5,6.465703045187384E-5,6.473065228993043E-5,6.480039230764025E-5,6.5297702027601E-5,6.495621342870663E-5,6.768684924258115E-5,6.428344017046637E-5,6.428515990303488E-5,6.444802599211562E-5,6.581785369713186E-5,6.458929248439047E-5,6.933113401186674E-5,6.477097263292736E-5,6.43534098041897E-5,6.465044321264055E-5,6.428892607938595E-5,6.432691610466123E-5,6.4133145246177E-5,6.41497843428879E-5,6.429417771112784E-5,0.11941666635793018,6.464219326191547E-5,6.43866160997737E-5,6.5168980

{"value":"I was one of the few non-liberals who showed up to see Steve's video. It was quite an experience... in propaganda film-making and boredom.<br /><br />I was hoping the film might be an actual documentary of Michael Moore's visit to my local school, UVSC, but it turned out to be another liberal, slash-and-burn effort to slam conservatives and the local religious community. It sure seems self-serving for a filmmaker to make a documentary that only reflects his preconceptions on issues.<br /><br />What's more surprising is to see all the '10' votes his homeys have posted here. Did they even see the video? Golly gee Batman, this must rank with All The President's Men! Their ratings are as obvious as the bias in this film. <br /><br />Yeah, like stacking the votes at IMDb will help a lame movie. Maybe my vote will help balance this out.","finished_norm":["i","be","on","of","the","few","nonliber","who","show","up","to","see","steve","video","it","be","quit","a","experi","in","propaganda","filmmak","and","boredombr","br","i","be","hope","the","film","mai","be","a","actual","documentari","of","michael","moor","visit","to","my","local","school","uvsc","but","it","turn","out","to","be","anoth","liber","slashandburn","effort","to","slam","conserv","and","the","local","religi","commun","it","sure","seem","selfserv","for","a","filmmak","to","make","a","documentari","that","onli","reflect","hi","preconcept","on","issuesbr","br","what","much","surpris","be","to","see","all","the","vote","hi","homei","have","post","here","do","thei","even","see","the","video","golli","gee","batman","thi","must","rank","with","all","the","presid","man","their","rate","be","a","obviou","a","the","bia","in","thi","film","br","br","ye","like","stack","the","vote","at","imdb","will","help","a","lame","movi","mayb","my","vote","will","help","balanc","thi","out"],"filtered":["nonliber","show","see","steve","video","quit","experi","propaganda","filmmak","boredombr","br","hope","film","mai","actual","documentari","michael","moor","visit","local","school","uvsc","turn","anoth","liber","slashandburn","effort","slam","conserv","local","religi","commun","sure","seem","selfserv","filmmak","make","documentari","onli","reflect","hi","preconcept","issuesbr","br","much","surpris","see","vote","hi","homei","post","thei","even","see","video","golli","gee","batman","thi","must","rank","presid","man","rate","obviou","bia","thi","film","br","br","ye","like","stack","vote","imdb","help","lame","movi","mayb","vote","help","balanc","thi"],"filtered2":["nonliber","show","see","steve","video","quit","experi","propaganda","filmmak","boredombr","hope","mai","actual","documentari","michael","moor","visit","local","school","uvsc","turn","anoth","liber","slashandburn","effort","slam","conserv","local","religi","commun","sure","seem","selfserv","filmmak","make","documentari","onli","reflect","preconcept","issuesbr","surpris","see","vote","homei","post","even","see","video","golli","gee","batman","must","rank","presid","man","rate","obviou","bia","ye","like","stack","vote","imdb","help","lame","mayb","vote","help","balanc"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,11,28,35,45,46,52,73,96,119,120,141,163,181,185,202,209,240,296,323,326,333,372,383,401,466,475,592,624,1061,1086,1105,1167,1190,1224,1317,1654,1656,1698,1756,1843,1887,2854,3058,3416,4001,5100,6048,8090,8274],"values":[1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,11,28,35,45,46,52,73,96,119,120,141,163,181,185,202,209,240,296,323,326,333,372,383,401,466,475,592,624,1061,1086,1105,1167,1190,1224,1317,1654,1656,1698,1756,1843,1887,2854,3058,3416,4001,5100,6048,8090,8274],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,1.967100616408184,0.926017105726131,0.9913098153388195,1.5452294193519092,1.463169012899134,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.7122153074726136,1.8950689206770979,2.0390708128715254,2.1653408989309972,2.2044500422972613,2.2657547357741192,2.4000574358028657,2.4442286541160034,5.037666054744002,2.597304642813496,2.6026896854443837,5.533214255322713,2.9504565686333644,6.0866465060504265,2.942840385588056,2.948928684455311,3.070535816550098,3.0433232530252132,3.0879275592619675,3.4446025032006995,6.7442140023250925,3.509308122676031,7.8483511669251715,4.218628162481577,5.116075806554253,4.613282354485526,4.2574141875167335,12.875701090763709,4.403125998698128,4.597282013139085,4.637773374493822,4.798834931860927,4.890269137820559,5.185068678041204,4.828393734102471,4.900964426937307,5.3560264761848435,5.541743621979936,5.850044981634453,5.822646007446338,6.137727054086234,6.489124940924123,6.948657270302562,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[5.896347155977061E-5,5.8565867086508706E-5,5.902116085767381E-5,5.868013596146468E-5,0.09115458770104438,5.85990729220274E-5,5.877335477538745E-5,5.857430018868833E-5,5.87059965683775E-5,6.513109855853098E-5,0.36482086313249995,5.8479748353977074E-5,5.957124385706796E-5,0.1714925072458294,5.852239117642192E-5,5.836066053724456E-5,5.981639421114978E-5,5.8778861395090015E-5,5.8596500206588016E-5,5.864506628697894E-5,5.92124916993284E-5,5.883709637288773E-5,5.890409133307399E-5,5.896755388485471E-5,5.9420099566523216E-5,5.910934917382854E-5,6.159419392183751E-5,5.849713384696402E-5,5.849869878228755E-5,5.864690490484141E-5,5.9893431139204786E-5,5.8775455662000325E-5,0.11900070232588668,5.89407823454839E-5,5.856080534647125E-5,5.883110206682555E-5,5.8502125956090254E-5,5.8536696408254675E-5,5.836036732856737E-5,5.8375508700354704E-5,5.8506904875888356E-5,0.03593873133188805,5.882359471391295E-5,5.85910226639046E-5,5.930296502571023E-5

{"value":"...except for Jon Heder. This guy tanked the entire movie.<br /><br />The plot sounded entertaining. A 29 year old slacker son(Heder)still lives with widowed mom (Keaton)who happens to meet a new love (Daniels). Slacker son is jealous and anxious to lose his comfortable life and tries to sabotage the relationship. He also meets a girl(Faris).<br /><br />I really liked the performance of Daniels and especially Faris but whoever casted Hader would be better of selling hot dogs at the beach. Heders performance is annoying, which would be a good thing since he plays an annoying guy, problem is he is to bad an actor to loose this act making this guy likable in the finale. At the end you still wish you can personally punch the guy in the face and you're upset about the end.

{"value":"This film was one of the worst I've seen in a long while. <br /><br />It's a combination police drama and comedy about two Hollywood detectives, Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett, investigating a shootout at a hip hop club. <br /><br />The plot is contrived and there are way too many side issues going on. Ford is hustling real estate on the side (Martin Landau is one of his clients), Hartnett runs a yoga school where he's hustling chicks in his spare time, the two are under investigation by Internal Affairs, Ford is screwing the ex-girlfriend (Lena Olin) of the IA investigator and she's a psychic who has a radio show, the man who set up the killing at the club is a dirty ex-cop who shot Hartnett's father years ago.<br /><br />Toss in the obligatory car chases and some lame attempts at humor, and that's about the gist of this

{"value":"This is one really bad movie. I've racked my brain and I cannot come up with one positive comment to make. The acting is atrocious. I've seen more believable performances on cable access. The plot is ridiculous. Stolen diamonds, secret recordings of the President, and a shark that attacks anything that gets near it should have made for cheesy fun at the worst. Night of the Sharks isn't even so bad it's good. The dialogue sounds and is delivered as if it were written seconds before it's filmed. And to top it off, Night of the Sharks has the worst soundtrack I've ever heard. I'm surprised my ears didn't start bleeding from the 80s techno synthesized sounds that someone actually bothered to record.<br /><br />From everything I've read, the Italian film industry was dead by 1987.

{"value":"CQ is incredibly slow, and I'm a David Mamet fan. The movie follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very Barbarella-esque film. After that the movie started to lose me. Deep and profound? Not really. The movie \"Dragonfly\" being made in CQ has the problem of having no ending. This greatly parallels CQ, which also lacks an ending (in my opinion).<br /><br />I was lucky enough to catch this movie at the SxSW film festival. I had fairly high expectations having just watched Y Tu Mama Tambien and several other great movies. I was also looking forward to Jason Schwartzman's performance. But it was not an easy film to get into. If you're not into 60's sci-fi or slow movies that go no where, skip it.<br /><br />CQ feels like a student film.

{"value":"This is easily the worst Ridley Scott film. Ridley Scott is a wonderful director. But this film is a black mark on his career. Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen, both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army. Very stupid. And there is never one scene that is convincing in any way. It is really not difficult to make a film such as this. Everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody. The writers didn't have much inspiration either; many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all; and some brainless action. I strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish. I hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention, and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent

{"value":"I saw this movie a couple years back. I could'nt sleep and there was nothing on. So I peeped it. What really gets me is it makes no sense and thats why its disturbing. Richard gets tied up in chicken wire and Jarvis starts making out with Richard's girl while she's unconscious. Then Jarvis's buddy Troubador is playing some stupid song on his guitar. By the next morning it shows Richard's girl talking to Jarvis and Trouby and then she walks back to Richard and looks at him while he's still tied up. Then they play some happy music and the movie is finished. I mean what happened? Did they brake up? And what was she saying to those 2 guys(Trouby and Jarvis)? Its to puzzling and to poor to. I can't stand movies that are disturbing and don't make sense.

{"value":"Having the In-Laws over for the weekend? Then this is the film to hasten their departure, failing that it will induce a catatonic state to bring a welcome relief from constant nagging.<br /><br />The film is supposedly set on board a luxury cruise ship, which is more superannuated car ferry; the plot has more holes than the average colander and a cast dredged from the depths of the celebrity D list. An interesting piece of added amusement is playing \"Spot the Villain\" as passengers join the ship. You won't be wrong!!!! With a script that sinks faster than a brick, clichéd set pieces and copious amounts of raspberry jam doubling as blood this film attempts to encompass the genres of thriller, action movie and

{"value":"Chesty gringo Telly Savalas (as Frank Cooper) is a US-Mexico \"Border Cop\". He serves as a father figure to young immigrant Danny De La Paz (as Benny Romero), who wants Mr. Savalas to be best man at his impending wedding. Savalas is tough, but boss Eddie Albert (as Commander Moffat) may be tougher. Tough is what you need to stop smuggler Michael V. Gazzo (as Chico Suarez). Alliances may be in flux.<br /><br />If you find the possibility of hearing \"Kojak\" and \"Oliver Douglas\" uttering expletives to be repulsive, you ought to steer clear of \"The Border\".

{"value":"Adrianne, should really get a life-without Mr. \"Brady\". She nauseates me, and has been one of the main reasons why I know longer tune in to the show. It's pretty brainless show, and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death. This makes them look/sound they are anything but ready for marriage, and yet, I know these disagreements are all part of life. I guess to some people this is entertainment. If this happens to fall into next season I will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash. Though I would not be terribly surprised. can't even stand the commercials for this show anymore! I hope they're getting enough money to constantly embarrass themselves in front of a camera week after week.

{"value":"I am definitely in the minority opinion on this one. \"The Hurt Locker\" has won more \"Best Picture\" awards from the critic groups than any other film this year. However, not only did I not like it, I found it hard to sit through.<br /><br />There is minimal plot and little character development. They disarm bombs, fight, and disarm more bombs. That is the entire movie. <br /><br />But the worst part was that the camera never stops moving and is constantly shaking. This has been a recent fad in film making and it is supposed to make it seem more real because it has a cheap, documentary look to it. The camera was shaking so much it was making me nauseous to look at the screen.<br /><br />I normally don't care for war movies and \"The Hurt Locker\" was no exception.

{"value":"Just okay horror film about a nice suburban family dealing with the death of their parents and the \"thing\" in the basement that they keep feeding people they pick up off the street. Of course there is more to it then that but to say more would be telling.<br /><br />For me this just didn't come together as it tries to have it two ways both as a family drama and a horror film. the film tries very hard to walk the cutting edge between the two genres but seems more to stumble all over the place as it tries to be shocking, something it never really is. It doesn't help that the final revelation is less a scare then an \"oh\", as on \"Oh thats it?\".

{"value":"This movie rivals \"Plan 9\" as one of the dumbest movie ever made. Always be concerned when the same person is the:<br /><br />1. Star 2. Director 3. Producer 4. Writer 5. Stuntman, and 6. Editor. Unfortunately, Justin Kreinbrink did all 6 jobs! IMDb shows that he and his father were western 'stunt men'. So maybe that was the problem. <br /><br />Here's just ONE example from the film: in the film the sheriff has to take a witness to another town for protection. Of course, the bad guys find out and are waiting for them. But, what happens? The good guys are riding along and a shot rings out and hits a tree near them. When the camera shows us the bad guys they're all just sitting on a log, chatting. What's wrong with this picture!<br /><br />I could go on. Perhaps this film was meant as a comedy.

{"value":"I've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story yet the story line wasn't good at all. The play of the actors weren't any better.<br /><br />Of course Shahrukh Khan was there yet he wasn't enough to make this movie \"credible\" and interesting.<br /><br />I've read that this movie was based on the novel of Flaubert \"Madame Bovary\" yet for me I didn't see it matching with the Indian mentality.<br /><br />In general we buy movie to dream and have a good time, not to waste our time and change our mood into worse. I just can't understand how it could get such a \"high\" vote with an average of 6.8/10.<br /><br />So it's the kind of movie you should run away & ignore because there is nothing to appreciate in it!

{"value":"John Leguizemo, a wonderful comic actor, is a New York Latino, able to get inside a myriad of characters, both male and female, to show the bizarre foibles of an ethnic group trying to cope in an alien culture. He is not, however, Italian. He doesn't look, think or behave Italian...Especially Sicilian or Calabrese, immigrant groups who live in Bensonhurst or Bayridge Brooklyn. Every scene in which he interacts with his \"Gumbas\" rings false, as though he'd wandered in from a college production of \"West Side Story\" while the other guys were doing a low-rent \"Mean Streets\". That's only one problem with this ill-conceived, mean-spirited flick. Spike blew this one big time.

{"value":"This service comedy, for which Peter Marshall (Joanne Dru's brother and later perennial host of The Hollywood Squares) and Tommy Noonan were hyped as 'the new Lewis and Martin' is just shy of dreadful: a few random sight gags are inserted, everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right -- there's one scene in which Noonan is throwing grenades at officers and politicians in anger; they're about five feet apart, Noonan is throwing them in between, and the total reaction is that everyone flinches.<br /><br />In the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching Julie Newmar, there are a few moments of brightness: Marshall and Noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying, and their timing is nigh unto perfect -- clearly they were a well honed comedy

{"value":"Please! Do not waste any money on this movie. It really is nothing more than a boring German Blair Witch ripoff made by some high school kids. I couldn't finish watching it, and usually I like watching all kinds of B-movies. How on earth could they find a distributor for it?!!! Funny however: Check out Wikipedia for \"dark area\". The guy who wrote the entry must be completely out of his mind. Maybe he got loads of money from the producers. Money that should have been spend on actors, camera and editing. Even that wouldn't have helped, since there is absolutely no interesting idea behind this film. Unfortunately \"dark area\" has already gotten too much attention. Please, director, producer and author of this movie, STOP making movies like that...you are not doing yourself a favor.

{"value":"This had a great cast with big-name stars like Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Randolph Scott, Nancy Kelly, Henry Hull and Brian Donlevey and a bunch more lesser-but-known names with shorter roles. It also had Technicolor, one of the few movies made with it in 1939.<br /><br />Now the bad news.......regrettably, I can't say much positive for the story. It portrayed the James boys in a totally positive light....and Hollywood has done that ever since. Why these criminals are always shown to be the \"good guys\" is beyond me. This film glamorizes them and made their enemies - the railroad people - into vicious human beings. The latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous. Well, that's the film world for you: evil is good; good is bad.<br /><br />Hey Hollywood: here's a news flash - The James boys were criminals!

{"value":"This is only the second time I stopped a video/DVD part way through.<br /><br />I was willing to give this film the benefit of the doubt at first, even though it managed to be both shallow, clichéd and stupid.. AND joyless, plodding and pretentious.<br /><br />It was like an After School Special directed by that weird grade nine kid who thinks nobody understands him... creepy and sad, with voice-over narration that only the most deluded adolescent would consider poetry... and some singing, and... no, really, the poor child's suffering...<br /><br />Enough, already, especially when it morphed into a brazen, clumsy, and insulting Clockwork Orange ripoff. And did I mention the singing?<br /><br />This isn't the worst film I've ever seen, but certainly the one I've felt least compelled to sit through.

{"value":"I have a high tolerance for the weird, but frankly some movies go way, way beyond weird--so far that they make your brain hurt. This is such a film. Trying to understand it or even explain it is impossible and I think the film is best understood while taking drugs--it's that incomprehensible.<br /><br />The film begins with some very cute Japanese animation involving a cat. However, out of the blue, tons of twisted and occasionally disturbing things occur--making me wonder if I am losing something in the translation. However, even if this is so, why did we need to be treated to images of a magic trick involving dismembering a lady with a clever, defecation, puking, lighting animals on fire, etc.. All this really seemed random and pretty awful. Oddly, and I don't know why, some see this as a work of genius.

{"value":"This film is horribly acted, written, directed and produced. But it's so campy it's actually semi-watchable. That's SEMI watchable.<br /><br />The storyline (what little there is) makes virtually no sense whatsoever. The Barney Drum character is the only real comic relief in the movie and that gets tired after about 30 seconds. <br /><br />Many of the Canadian supporting cast can be found in TV commercials.. None of them went on to anything else that I'm aware of. And of course Sly Stallone's even less talented brother well..... =\\<br /><br />Trivia: It was filmed almost entirely in and around the little village of Claremont, Ont. (about 20 miles N.east of Toronto) I recognized many local landmarks/intersections/buildings.
