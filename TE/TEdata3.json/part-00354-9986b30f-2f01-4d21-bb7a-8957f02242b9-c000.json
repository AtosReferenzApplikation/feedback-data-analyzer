Unfortunately, this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining, but get disappointed from the start. <br /><br />Well, at least I got good laughs.

Music is completely out of the story and I don't have words to describe the visual effects.If you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting, but a few minutes later it becomes busy.The story is interesting but the development needs a complete review.","finished_norm":["thi","film","be","not","programm","in","italian","cinemasi","have","see","it","at","a","manifest","call","fantafestivali","find","it","terribl","becaus","some","scene","seem","like","music","video","chaotic","and","dark","the","us","of","fluoresc","color","be","ridicul","and","there","no","suspenc","in","the","film","music","be","complet","out","of","the","stori","and","i","do","not","have","word","to","describ","the","visual","effectsif","you","look","at","the","scene","the","film","seem","to","be","interest","but","a","few","minut","late","it","becom","busyth","stori","be","interest","but","the","develop","ne","a","complet","review"],"filtered":["thi","film","programm","italian","cinemasi","see","manifest","call","fantafestivali","find","terribl","becaus","scene","seem","like","music","video","chaotic","dark","us","fluoresc","color","ridicul","suspenc","film","music","complet","stori","word","describ","visual","effectsif","look","scene","film","seem","interest","minut","late","becom","busyth","stori","interest","develop","ne","complet","review"],"filtered2":["programm","italian","cinemasi","see","manifest","call","fantafestivali","find","terribl","becaus","scene","seem","like","music","video","chaotic","dark","us","fluoresc","color","ridicul","suspenc","music","complet","stori","word","describ","visual","effectsif","look","scene","seem","interest","minut","late","becom","busyth","stori","interest","develop","ne","complet","review"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,16,17,19,22,35,38,56,59,60,103,110,115,118,142,150,166,176,240,258,274,320,368,635,668,875,1030,2371,4946,6240],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,16,17,19,22,35,38,56,59,60,103,110,115,118,142,150,166,176,240,258,274,320,368,635,668,875,1030,2371,4946,6240],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,2.62476135602347,1.2979240167361772,2.926338025798268,1.519311641348122,1.8610609350701788,1.8693254449200722,3.676353282473182,4.197164082437498,2.1290479736304078,2.201553588425805,4.70875905096179,2.2844323215331563,2.332712011146513,2.4423870329693536,2.5040471493269134,2.7666071276613566,2.7061321952397077,2.748952192422636,2.938298364153555,3.1346146732346205,3.587125145032839,3.5813614403160887,3.9282323841582003,4.297765483040301,5.259176650194926,6.101359409915359,6.437831646536572]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.3418560858443409E-4,1.332807636557148E-4,1.3431689450337973E-4,1.335408100560134E-4,1.33542997971836E-4,1.3335633154766148E-4,1.3375295196263546E-4,1.3329995521479864E-4,1.3359966210771867E-4,1.4822153219031455E-4,0.7204179517816579,1.3308477969768812E-4,1.3556874111439262E-4,1.3750265899572622E-4,1.331818237307166E-4,1.3281376663247123E-4,1.3612663990472782E-4,1.3376548360462473E-4,1.3335047671283212E-4,1.3346100054871602E-4,1.3475231400547548E-4,1.3389801134985367E-4,1.340504745489645E-4,1.3419489890030862E-4,1.3522477580715577E-4,1.3451758829837216E-4,1.4017245216457828E-4,1.3312434458244272E-4,1.3312790597042122E-4,1.334651847673569E-4,1.3630195602504913E-4,1.3375773303710847E-4,0.2390895499646094,1.341339738019692E-4,1.3326924444476173E-4,1.3388436985986476E-4,1.3313570533145401E-4,1.33214378737887E-4,1.3281309936536922E-4,1.3284755721078336E-4,1.3314658091670233E-4,1.3455099521591615E-4,0.030150395036217602,1.333380112426168E-4,1.3495820789265778E-4,1.333891870999539E-4,1.3782104740242258E-4,1.3579434872783912E-4,1.3288057709125316E-4,1.3317425129282982E-4,1.3312806144511884E-4,1.3687478552818532E-4,1.3317623267180366E-4,1.3283576338341544E-4,1.342938259891716E-4,1.3321053533398488E-4,1.4325329053518584E-4,1.3310075254383024E-4,1.3287904040361025E-4,1.3351349882153988E-4,1.3483784051981682E-4,1.335046661441555E-4,1.3285445748406797E-4,1.3316378874068862E-4,1.3281470576331612E-4,1.358877627707905E-4,1.3395884210750842E-4,1.3367349016051895E-4,1.3355658665193643E-4,1.3404342164030728E-4,1.3280986047221253E-4,1.3355938660321166E-4,1.357256311912376E-4,1.3304786311922368E-4,1.3634072840909044E-4,1.3339962815234007E-4,1.3444368053299518E-4,1.336220199013731E-4,1.327682206693963E-4,1.3293279599751467E-4]}}
{"value":"Oh, those Italians! Assuming that movies about aristocrats with weird fetishes, castles drowned in gothic atmosphere, and back-stabbing relatives trying to get their hands on an inheritance are inherently interesting to all! If you've seen one film of this type, you've basically seen them all (the MST3K favorite \"Screaming Skull\" fits the mold, too)...and \"The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave\" is formulaic, by-the-numbers, and dull as hell. Even the luscious Erika Blanc is put to waste here.<br /><br />zero/10<br /><br />","finished_norm":["oh","that","italian","assum","that","movi","about","aristocrat","with","weird","fetish","castl","drown","in","gothic","atmospher","and","backstab","rel","try","to","get","their","hand","on","a","inherit","be","inher","interest","to","all","if","you","have","see","on","film","of","thi","typ","you","have","basic","see","them","all","the","mstk","favorit","scream","skull","fit","the","mold","tooand","the","night","evelyn","come","out","of","the","grave","be","formula","bythenumb","and","dull","a","hell","even","the","lusciou","erika","blanc","be","put","to","wast","herebr","br","zerobr","br"],"filtered":["oh","italian","assum","movi","aristocrat","weird","fetish","castl","drown","gothic","atmospher","backstab","rel","try","get","hand","inherit","inher","interest","see","film","thi","typ","basic","see","mstk","favorit","scream","skull","fit","mold","tooand","night","evelyn","come","grave","formula","bythenumb","dull","hell","even","lusciou","erika","blanc","put","wast","herebr","br","zerobr","br"],"filtered2":["oh","italian","assum","aristocrat","weird","fetish","castl","drown","gothic","atmospher","backstab","rel","try","get","hand","inherit","inher","interest","see","typ","basic","see","mstk","favorit","scream","skull","fit","mold","tooand","night","evelyn","come","grave","formula","bythenumb","dull","hell","even","lusciou","erika","blanc","put","wast","herebr","zerobr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,34,36,60,89,159,210,234,235,286,367,384,394,526,625,676,822,835,920,1030,1165,1176,1444,1547,1728,1960,2357,2499,3728,3793,3929,3950,4703,4889,5279,5598,5663,8444,8491],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,5,34,36,60,89,159,210,234,235,286,367,384,394,526,625,676,822,835,920,1030,1165,1176,1444,1547,1728,1960,2357,2499,3728,3793,3929,3950,4703,4889,5279,5598,5663,8444,8491],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.3982850089458962,1.4680183469605717,1.838176641236591,1.9940046109572438,2.300267965194495,2.687151791517189,2.673149229007135,2.6457189377809835,2.780700890737216,3.0791938792932125,3.109204957709252,3.0967381889441223,3.5119855004467477,3.6194333882654965,3.6105180246075443,3.813163054373413,3.8614098879127985,3.952924996748572,4.297765483040301,4.246178114249808,4.358390104856736,4.573751515728891,4.77960356993304,4.688631791727313,5.2288713006995975,5.143104478942172,5.541743621979936,5.719991853386255,5.822646007446338,5.822646007446338,5.878215858601149,7.0356686472921925,6.948657270302562,6.2980697041614135,6.389041482367141,6.543192162194399,7.0356686472921925,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.319696942041988E-5,7.270338514356346E-5,7.32685846368039E-5,7.284523797421607E-5,7.28464314614257E-5,7.274460670774116E-5,7.296095936055262E-5,7.271385395596598E-5,7.287734120700269E-5,8.085343185186248E-5,0.31474021841808303,7.259647776404708E-5,7.395145502113211E-5,7.50063887768076E-5,7.264941435831345E-5,7.244864272229792E-5,7.425578348918953E-5,7.296779525171228E-5,7.274141295119388E-5,7.280170264932743E-5,7.350610182151676E-5,7.304008787248746E-5,7.312325509318111E-5,7.320203719910455E-5,7.376382522728831E-5,7.337806118745564E-5,0.14821472139313652,7.261806003125186E-5,7.26200027344203E-5,7.280398510068069E-5,7.435141676039828E-5,7.296356739106864E-5,7.832020872494603E-5,7.31688031391548E-5,7.269710152387596E-5,7.303264656983137E-5,7.262425721146175E-5,7.26671728041667E-5,7.244827873445916E-5,7.246707516042227E-5,7.263018973946715E-5,7.339628434229091E-5,7.302332697810728E-5,7.273461315610565E-5,0.03992218165378781,7.276252909809141E-5,7.518006661539717E-5,7.40745218220854E-5,7.248508719022571E-5,7.264528366568341E-5,7.26200875443847E-5,0.10032934114961715,7.264636448901229E-5,7.246064174010018E-5,7.325600098236525E-5,7.266507626400222E-5,0.28588775844849607,7.260519079924478E-5,7.248424894177573E-5,0.10548863543804594,7.355275571921056E-5,7.28255218150921E-5,7.247083919367395E-5,7.26395764432978E-5,7.244915500921497E-5,7.412547829139297E-5,7.307327047049367E-5,7.291761370552322E-5,7.285384395679139E-5,7.311940779878976E-5,7.244651194913958E-5,7.285537130350191E-5,7.403703706139959E-5,7.257634012266008E-5,7.437256672602402E-5,7.276822459256576E-5,7.333774520648496E-5,7.288953717015921E-5,7.242379783392585E-5,7.251357210544958E-5]}}
{"value":"What a long, drawn-out, pointless movie. I'm sure that historically this film is delightful but as entertainment goes it just doesn't make the grade. Ralph Fiennes has been in some fantastic movies, the English Patient, Schindler's List, but this one was such a let-down. It didn't seem to be going anywhere, his character at the beginning was so shallow and uptight it amazes me that his \"sister\" would ever have been interested at all. Don't bother paying to rent this movie, buy yourself a copy of the English Patient instead.","finished_norm":["what","a","long","drawnout","pointless","movi","i","be","sure","that","histor","thi","film","be","delight","but","a","entertain","go","it","just","doe","not","make","the","grade","ralph","fienn","have","be","in","some","fantast","movi","the","english","patient","schindler","list","but","thi","on","be","such","a","letdown","it","do","not","seem","to","be","go","anywher","hi","charact","at","the","begin","be","so","shallow","and","uptight","it","amaz","me","that","hi","sister","would","ever","have","be","interest","at","all","do","not","bother","pai","to","rend","thi","movi","bui","yourself","a","copi","of","the","english","patient","instead"],"filtered":["long","drawnout","pointless","movi","sure","histor","thi","film","delight","entertain","go","doe","make","grade","ralph","fienn","fantast","movi","english","patient","schindler","list","thi","letdown","seem","go","anywher","hi","charact","begin","shallow","uptight","amaz","hi","sister","ever","interest","bother","pai","rend","thi","movi","bui","copi","english","patient","instead"],"filtered2":["long","drawnout","pointless","sure","histor","delight","entertain","go","doe","make","grade","ralph","fienn","fantast","english","patient","schindler","list","letdown","seem","go","anywher","charact","begin","shallow","uptight","amaz","sister","ever","interest","bother","pai","rend","bui","copi","english","patient","instead"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,10,18,35,44,60,99,119,147,152,195,322,347,496,531,534,585,588,602,685,747,938,953,1150,1292,1395,1915,2163,3665,4786,6453,6782,7419,7994],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,10,18,35,44,60,99,119,147,152,195,322,347,496,531,534,585,588,602,685,747,938,953,1150,1292,1395,1915,2163,3665,4786,6453,6782,7419,7994],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.9416538289407692,1.1238870241028365,1.2153159934048174,1.463169012899134,1.604729392502474,1.838176641236591,2.056430207256609,2.1653408989309972,2.2844323215331563,2.3131195476980753,2.51289241584188,2.885344817328191,3.0151989841543516,3.293679367864308,3.424750734647968,3.4272107604888307,3.7165362186843414,7.275012338650383,3.555828138310924,3.607563812710113,3.7465885637507435,3.952924996748572,4.1302590120314875,4.246178114249808,4.3336974922663645,4.403125998698128,10.078229530836248,4.9909126636002465,5.695894301807195,6.389041482367141,6.725513718988353,6.600350576034347,6.725513718988353,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.129098487831356E-5,9.067538842518906E-5,9.138030310675578E-5,9.085230674189797E-5,9.085379525465566E-5,9.072679980494706E-5,9.099663401956803E-5,9.068844508863156E-5,9.089234577305014E-5,0.1124377674258046,0.3448494859173385,9.054205394366493E-5,9.223197648098382E-5,9.354768589217326E-5,9.060807626487503E-5,9.035767463578279E-5,0.4643211858897212,9.100515971730426E-5,9.072281656379689E-5,9.079800964848616E-5,9.167653364593863E-5,9.109532280195458E-5,9.119904864671063E-5,9.129730539282301E-5,9.199796530800571E-5,9.151684184885417E-5,9.536403602373403E-5,9.056897126612557E-5,9.057139419820837E-5,9.080085631322688E-5,9.2730807257454E-5,9.099988674541564E-5,9.768066966418398E-5,9.125585599828742E-5,9.066755151835516E-5,9.10860420372777E-5,9.057670036596822E-5,9.063022453173209E-5,9.035722067151969E-5,9.038066350326466E-5,9.058409939257711E-5,9.153956969900526E-5,9.107441867754172E-5,9.071433588494515E-5,9.181661018573738E-5,9.074915254276398E-5,9.376429623904857E-5,9.238546493212884E-5,9.040312803907035E-5,9.06029244805674E-5,9.05714999728769E-5,9.31205224442041E-5,9.060427247935688E-5,9.037263976564287E-5,0.07145154108581417,9.062760973472657E-5,9.746003403775869E-5,9.055292080838318E-5,9.04020825787572E-5,9.083372599006004E-5,9.173472021162028E-5,9.082771682241501E-5,9.038535799137504E-5,9.059580645427987E-5,9.035831355809841E-5,9.244901764893996E-5,9.113670801334781E-5,9.094257348169107E-5,9.086304009098834E-5,9.119425031562007E-5,9.035501714351614E-5,9.08649449920595E-5,9.233871407962727E-5,9.051693835308923E-5,9.275718541501165E-5,9.075625594204471E-5,9.146655990906498E-5,9.09075565324151E-5,9.032668818447698E-5,9.043865431817114E-5]}}
{"value":"This is about the worst movie I have ever seen. This movie does match the quality of such movies as \"THEY\" & \"Cabin Fever\", but even those had name actors where this one fell short. The \"eye candy\" of this movie looked to be a 50 woman with a bad face lift. (just an example of the quality). I would have rated this movie in the negative if possible. Ladies I have to tell you that the men were not bad to look at, but not much either. If you were planning on going to see this movie I would strongly recommend saving your money.","finished_norm":["thi","be","about","the","wrong","movi","i","have","ever","see","thi","movi","doe","match","the","qualiti","of","such","movi","a","thei","cabin","fever","but","even","that","have","name","actor","where","thi","on","fall","short","the","ey","candi","of","thi","movi","look","to","be","a","woman","with","a","bad","face","lift","just","a","exampl","of","the","qualiti","i","would","have","rate","thi","movi","in","the","neg","if","possibl","ladi","i","have","to","tell","you","that","the","man","be","not","bad","to","look","at","but","not","much","either","if","you","be","plan","on","go","to","see","thi","movi","i","would","strongli","recommend","save","your","monei"],"filtered":["thi","wrong","movi","ever","see","thi","movi","doe","match","qualiti","movi","thei","cabin","fever","even","name","actor","thi","fall","short","ey","candi","thi","movi","look","woman","bad","face","lift","exampl","qualiti","rate","thi","movi","neg","possibl","ladi","tell","man","bad","look","much","either","plan","go","see","thi","movi","strongli","recommend","save","monei"],"filtered2":["wrong","ever","see","doe","match","qualiti","cabin","fever","even","name","actor","fall","short","ey","candi","look","woman","bad","face","lift","exampl","qualiti","rate","neg","possibl","ladi","tell","man","bad","look","either","plan","go","see","strongli","recommend","save","monei"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,9,16,18,25,41,44,45,70,90,126,143,170,189,202,207,251,272,281,298,307,319,402,472,581,919,1147,1610,1788,1875,2225,3018],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,5,6,9,16,18,25,41,44,45,70,90,126,143,170,189,202,207,251,272,281,298,307,319,402,472,581,919,1147,1610,1788,1875,2225,3018],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,2.1367141713444147,2.393227744058217,1.2153159934048174,1.2796387880827016,1.5687599167621034,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,2.094675786251684,2.0477128419653545,2.2391270689902285,2.3409902041158843,2.4071371113909277,2.498193474075453,2.597304642813496,2.5531798379045583,2.6942272927333892,2.8028805344481915,2.832333801361687,2.7819920465008363,2.8767855639325206,5.811212004936025,3.084424928710765,3.4222967456864013,3.530930586689197,4.235066888824737,4.246178114249808,5.051537285416681,4.828393734102471,4.8184434032493035,5.00274712124725,5.719991853386255]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.19788935060052762,1.2433695826503604E-4,1.253035595541464E-4,1.2457955425213902E-4,1.2458159534787453E-4,1.244074551737379E-4,1.247774603765222E-4,1.2435486197458418E-4,1.2463445703702697E-4,1.3827512655564396E-4,0.6771857159836957,1.241541258101386E-4,1.2647140100071713E-4,1.2827554332631573E-4,1.2424465770351597E-4,1.239012990761457E-4,1.269918619937919E-4,1.247891510826997E-4,1.2440199322758858E-4,1.245051003616765E-4,1.2570976023138528E-4,1.2491278555383807E-4,1.2505501771026362E-4,1.2518975046578652E-4,1.2615051748476574E-4,1.2549078579240903E-4,1.307661800296687E-4,1.2419103569337727E-4,1.2419435809442228E-4,1.2450900379833344E-4,1.2715541352619375E-4,1.2478192061700184E-4,0.11527713397734828,1.2513291374605483E-4,1.2432621205071197E-4,1.249000594760088E-4,1.2420163407934784E-4,1.2427502810699235E-4,1.2390067658600128E-4,1.239328221377647E-4,1.242117798584688E-4,1.25521950938815E-4,1.2488412115780042E-4,1.2439036425272826E-4,1.2590183760966125E-4,1.2443810595425643E-4,1.2857256627958857E-4,1.2668186921569398E-4,1.2396362621921862E-4,1.2423759341405913E-4,1.2419450313599058E-4,1.2768980330661554E-4,1.242394418326007E-4,1.2392181973515978E-4,1.252820390525402E-4,1.2427144261470174E-4,1.3364027874729809E-4,1.2416902679847084E-4,1.2396219265099707E-4,1.2455407573800273E-4,1.25789547489145E-4,1.2454583577741735E-4,1.2393925936822375E-4,1.2422783295145938E-4,1.2390217518661704E-4,1.2676901470947143E-4,1.2496953426361653E-4,1.2470333085848505E-4,1.2459427215962275E-4,1.2504843808702838E-4,1.2389765503876372E-4,1.24596884220173E-4,1.2661776296925492E-4,1.2411968651860152E-4,1.2719158408947798E-4,1.2444784635984218E-4,1.2542183760748656E-4,1.2465531451098092E-4,1.2385880947483595E-4,1.2401234097587514E-4]}}
{"value":"I didn't know what to expect from the film. Well, now I know. This was a truly awful film. The screenplay, directing and acting were equally bad. The story was silly and stupid. The director could have made a smart and thought provoking film, but he didn't. I squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad. Where was the focus to the film? Where was anything in this film? Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it. It was shabbily done and a waste of my money.

{"value":"My friends and I walked out after 15 minutes, and we weren't the first. Afterwards, we tried to get our money back. Movie theater management wouldn't allow this, but they did agree to let us see another film. The only time that worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star. As you can tell, this wasn't a memorable night. Probably one of my worst movie nights. Close second has to be when I saw a double header of Domestic Disturbance and Heist. In conclusion, for the sake of humanity, please don't see The Order.","finished_norm":["my","friend","and","i","walk","out","after","minut","and","we","be","not","the","afterward","we","try","to","get","our","monei","back","movi","theater","manag","would","not","allow","thi","but","thei","do","agre","to","let","u","see","anoth","film","the","onli","time","that","work","for","u","be","to","see","dicki","robert","former","child","star","a","you","can","tell","thi","be","not","a","memor","night","probabl","on","of","my","wrong","movi","night","close","have","to","be","when","i","see","a","doubl","header","of","domest","disturb","and","heist","in","conclus","for","the","sake","of","human","pleas","do","not","see","the","order"],"filtered":["friend","walk","minut","afterward","try","get","monei","back","movi","theater","manag","allow","thi","thei","agre","let","u","see","anoth","film","onli","time","work","u","see","dicki","robert","former","child","star","tell","thi","memor","night","probabl","wrong","movi","night","close","see","doubl","header","domest","disturb","heist","conclus","sake","human","pleas","see","order"],"filtered2":["friend","walk","minut","afterward","try","get","monei","back","theater","manag","allow","agre","let","u","see","anoth","onli","time","work","u","see","dicki","robert","former","child","star","tell","memor","night","probabl","wrong","night","close","see","doubl","header","domest","disturb","heist","conclus","sake","human","pleas","see","order"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,11,25,36,48,59,63,73,90,100,112,124,126,148,161,180,210,292,294,295,345,346,424,439,521,539,622,839,957,1040,1074,1270,1307,2246,3837,4224],"values":[4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,4,8,11,25,36,48,59,63,73,90,100,112,124,126,148,161,180,210,292,294,295,345,346,424,439,521,539,622,839,957,1040,1074,1270,1307,2246,3837,4224],"values":[2.6228008218775787,0.7966340470719924,0.9418936859054116,0.9913098153388195,1.2796387880827016,1.4680183469605717,1.6955116224012472,1.8693254449200722,1.8729627573220065,1.8950689206770979,2.0477128419653545,2.1405462403177813,4.493325799357863,2.2323930368088845,2.2391270689902285,2.3018654096236517,2.4323182980210873,2.7097314792693545,5.374303583034378,2.9752256367457734,2.886778509330039,2.7910771187233068,3.0022328381570844,3.023389038124396,3.212973749990824,3.2872346624216657,3.4076979462652486,3.6105180246075443,3.4933926673701317,3.965503778955432,3.969732115064953,4.105687751300982,4.110553940952155,4.3521595551061,4.436351646326448,5.051537285416681,5.9370563586240825,5.907203395474402]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0661840365379434E-4,1.0589945083260878E-4,1.0672271808250147E-4,1.0610607308046559E-4,1.0610781150901091E-4,1.0595949399291361E-4,1.0627463237434757E-4,1.0591469966156094E-4,1.0615283451688758E-4,1.1777077524157115E-4,0.904389795813391,1.0574372998469527E-4,1.0771738426685332E-4,1.0925399642281021E-4,1.0582083720949212E-4,1.0552839407283728E-4,1.0816066785779438E-4,1.0628458950520648E-4,1.0595484198030401E-4,1.0604265970585555E-4,1.070686846337801E-4,1.0638989063835487E-4,1.0651103166887692E-4,1.0662578535931724E-4,1.0744408348328379E-4,1.0688218117449061E-4,1.1137530502476585E-4,1.057751666260593E-4,1.0577799635947903E-4,1.0604598431507954E-4,1.0829996688606294E-4,1.0627843122083671E-4,0.08728642592534572,1.0657737676471514E-4,1.058902981380976E-4,1.0637905166760815E-4,1.0578419341318403E-4,1.0584670408845226E-4,1.0552786388965314E-4,1.0555524268615867E-4,1.0579283470899964E-4,1.0690872494663658E-4,1.0636547678875461E-4,1.0594493742683383E-4,1.0723227950662102E-4,1.0598559967275166E-4,1.0950697484592092E-4,1.0789664286135955E-4,1.0558147893445437E-4,1.0581482045965008E-4,1.0577811989332325E-4,1.0875511381153779E-4,1.0581639478245154E-4,1.0554587179266121E-4,1.0670438878336515E-4,1.058436502766988E-4,1.1382321335453914E-4,1.0575642135581506E-4,1.0558025794522066E-4,1.0608437268910397E-4,1.0713664050867118E-4,1.0607735460443269E-4,1.05560725361463E-4,1.0580650734307067E-4,1.0552914026784702E-4,1.0797086584431122E-4,1.0643822427370235E-4,1.0621149527207193E-4,1.061186085191773E-4,1.0650542771574005E-4,1.0552529039744623E-4,1.0612083324609416E-4,1.0784204271360327E-4,1.0571439757933704E-4,1.0833077383873055E-4,1.0599389570650391E-4,1.0682345708294874E-4,1.0617059910650195E-4,1.0549220511094225E-4,1.056229699444433E-4]}}

{"value":"This waste of time is a completely unnecessary remake of a great film. Nothing new or original is added other than Perry's backflashes, which are of marginal interest. It lacks the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. Also painfully missing is the sharp Quincy Jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film. I can't understand any high ratings for this at all. It's quite bad. Why does anyone waste time or money making crap like this and why did I waste time watching it?","finished_norm":["thi","wast","of","time","be","a","complet","unnecessari","remak","of","a","great","film","noth","new","or","origin","be","add","other","than","perri","backflash","which","be","of","margin","interest","it","lack","the","documentari","feel","of","the","film","and","the","raw","urgenc","that","make","it","so","effect","conjur","painfulli","miss","be","the","sharp","quinci","jone","soundtrack","that","add","to","much","to","the","origin","film","i","ca","not","understand","ani","high","rate","for","thi","at","all","it","quit","bad","why","doe","anyon","wast","time","or","monei","make","crap","like","thi","and","why","do","i","wast","time","watch","it"],"filtered":["thi","wast","time","complet","unnecessari","remak","great","film","noth","new","origin","add","perri","backflash","margin","interest","lack","documentari","feel","film","raw","urgenc","make","effect","conjur","painfulli","miss","sharp","quinci","jone","soundtrack","add","much","origin","film","ca","understand","ani","high","rate","thi","quit","bad","doe","anyon","wast","time","monei","make","crap","like","thi","wast","time","watch"],"filtered2":["wast","time","complet","unnecessari","remak","great","noth","new","origin","add","perri","backflash","margin","interest","lack","documentari","feel","raw","urgenc","make","effect","conjur","painfulli","miss","sharp","quinci","jone","soundtrack","add","origin","ca","understand","ani","high","rate","quit","bad","doe","anyon","wast","time","monei","make","crap","like","wast","time","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,8,9,18,27,39,43,49,51,60,69,81,87,89,103,106,120,126,158,183,202,211,212,255,299,313,483,624,796,1081,1195,1240,2553,3186,3492,4359,7192],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,7,8,9,18,27,39,43,49,51,60,69,81,87,89,103,106,120,126,158,183,202,211,212,255,299,313,483,624,796,1081,1195,1240,2553,3186,3492,4359,7192],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.9609497720722932,2.825681057716235,1.0683570856722073,1.2153159934048174,1.3002700588679295,1.5538940054862738,1.6608112036218214,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,1.838176641236591,4.254065042302116,1.949757232424728,2.115024371522662,5.982013832871731,2.098582041218749,2.159084361316692,2.2044500422972613,2.2391270689902285,2.3106972614914807,2.4885128563647294,2.597304642813496,2.5687161421197025,2.5983793339432615,2.6754694156628323,5.589992261848085,2.907069060519773,3.613480989738201,3.9241755834625858,3.850067611308864,4.1302590120314875,4.422928625994308,4.3095999406873045,5.259176650194926,5.604922523601468,5.626901430320244,6.1754673820690815,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0384076712735728E-4,1.0314054455862789E-4,1.0394236394299312E-4,1.0334178385679542E-4,1.0334347699557405E-4,1.0319902346670694E-4,1.0350595182201825E-4,1.0315539612310384E-4,0.03580342897978005,1.1470259567925077E-4,0.8415743470435924,1.0298888057050848E-4,1.0491111695447249E-4,1.0640769709058023E-4,1.0306397898785081E-4,1.0277915461784827E-4,1.0534285206361705E-4,1.0351564954840828E-4,1.0319449264893521E-4,1.0328002253567282E-4,1.0427931732865657E-4,1.0361820736273286E-4,1.0373619241136345E-4,0.08610337407905125,1.0464493623848164E-4,1.0409767268175852E-4,1.0847374108478794E-4,1.0301949822040078E-4,1.0302225423323722E-4,1.0328326053174466E-4,1.054785220554739E-4,1.035096517004643E-4,1.1110884261970972E-4,1.0380080907613128E-4,1.0313163031130518E-4,1.0360765077026252E-4,1.0302828984049266E-4,1.0308917197951418E-4,1.0277863824706543E-4,1.0280530376760154E-4,1.0303670601214517E-4,1.0412352493209835E-4,1.0359442954591941E-4,1.0318484613018094E-4,1.0443865020658133E-4,1.0322444903797667E-4,1.0665408488689151E-4,1.0508570548074739E-4,1.0283085650574247E-4,0.028611108350713284,1.0302237454876165E-4,1.0592181143401719E-4,1.030596522954976E-4,1.0279617700584093E-4,1.0392451216114312E-4,1.0308619772606192E-4,1.1085787618820318E-4,1.030012413043763E-4,1.0282966732587917E-4,1.0332064880685345E-4,1.0434550280825176E-4,1.033138135582373E-4,1.0281064360753538E-4,1.0305002244497414E-4,1.027798813728885E-4,1.0515799479688843E-4,1.0366528180392253E-4,1.0344445957574724E-4,1.0335399272062655E-4,1.0373073445314295E-4,1.0277613179981239E-4,1.0335615948866826E-4,1.0503252778314567E-4,1.0296031233679171E-4,1.0550852642140166E-4,1.0323252894237802E-4,1.0404047847789138E-4,1.0340462884240458E-4,1.0274390845549786E-4,1.0287126658653987E-4]}}

{"value":"Incredibly muddled, off-putting and ultimately ludicrous (\"the horses, oh my God, the horses!\") thriller. It's creepy at times, but it has one of the worst scripts ever written for a horror film. Watch how in the final 10 minutes everybody \"magically\" does exactly what the plot needs for the \"resolution\" to occur. Bland performances by the leads, a typically eccentric one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real hack job, cutting scenes in half and making the movie even more difficult to understand. 0 out of 4 stars.","finished_norm":["incredibli","muddl","offput","and","ultim","ludicr","the","hors","oh","my","god","the","hors","thriller","it","creepi","at","time","but","it","have","on","of","the","wrong","script","ever","write","for","a","horror","film","watch","how","in","the","final","minut","everybodi","magic","doe","exactli","what","the","plot","ne","for","the","resolut","to","occur","bland","perform","by","the","lead","a","typic","eccentr","on","by","richard","lynch","the","video","transfer","be","a","real","hack","job","cut","scene","in","half","and","make","the","movi","even","much","difficult","to","understand","out","of","star"],"filtered":["incredibli","muddl","offput","ultim","ludicr","hors","oh","god","hors","thriller","creepi","time","wrong","script","ever","write","horror","film","watch","final","minut","everybodi","magic","doe","exactli","plot","ne","resolut","occur","bland","perform","lead","typic","eccentr","richard","lynch","video","transfer","real","hack","job","cut","scene","half","make","movi","even","much","difficult","understand","star"],"filtered2":["incredibli","muddl","offput","ultim","ludicr","hors","oh","god","hors","thriller","creepi","time","wrong","script","ever","write","horror","watch","final","minut","everybodi","magic","doe","exactli","plot","ne","resolut","occur","bland","perform","lead","typic","eccentr","richard","lynch","video","transfer","real","hack","job","cut","scene","half","make","even","difficult","understand","star"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,7,8,18,19,25,32,44,59,65,77,80,83,100,105,110,156,157,206,212,234,240,289,303,352,462,613,641,687,714,735,755,803,1022,1028,1126,1215,1253,1394,1807,1902,2190,2376,2530,3464],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,5,7,8,18,19,25,32,44,59,65,77,80,83,100,105,110,156,157,206,212,234,240,289,303,352,462,613,641,687,714,735,755,803,1022,1028,1126,1215,1253,1394,1807,1902,2190,2376,2530,3464],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,0.9418936859054116,1.2153159934048174,1.312380678011735,1.2796387880827016,1.3711311285073675,1.604729392502474,1.8693254449200722,1.9073850067444174,1.9463902258768238,1.9951803900462557,2.292318797740072,2.1405462403177813,2.1765612129984904,2.1290479736304078,2.3451551414151686,2.3360150694757706,2.597304642813496,2.5983793339432615,2.673149229007135,2.7666071276613566,2.8282659991423613,2.868298950055202,3.1236456418640466,3.2639531875991072,3.5364100524538222,3.7034641371169887,3.604618302480356,3.7297814454343623,3.7132521434831514,3.79165684915245,3.7636829971100436,4.165705761027235,4.086456389373095,8.913660355339978,4.291900363587903,4.315570107673808,4.403125998698128,5.143104478942172,4.85885294158718,5.064116067623542,5.143104478942172,5.156897801074508,5.626901430320244]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.698156770314495E-5,8.63950306574921E-5,8.706666963894646E-5,8.656359749422034E-5,8.656501574130554E-5,8.644401514829469E-5,8.670111176127311E-5,8.640747097738474E-5,8.660174647140107E-5,0.26001732943015565,0.5449945767995025,8.62679902684842E-5,8.78781395268015E-5,8.91317404971447E-5,8.633089598704895E-5,8.60923146388151E-5,8.823977973483102E-5,8.67092350009977E-5,8.644021993718768E-5,8.65118635107062E-5,8.734891653040041E-5,8.679514191132724E-5,8.689397134777424E-5,8.698758985595066E-5,8.765517491849084E-5,8.719676303048742E-5,9.086234929878663E-5,8.629363695100295E-5,8.629594550788051E-5,8.65145757978198E-5,8.835342285312106E-5,8.670421094126236E-5,9.30696255825158E-5,8.69480970919953E-5,8.638756369409735E-5,8.678629924781391E-5,8.630100119646643E-5,8.635199873860437E-5,8.60918821040655E-5,8.611421831020127E-5,8.630805094989802E-5,8.72184180059409E-5,8.677522457211445E-5,8.643213959121821E-5,8.748238071688461E-5,8.646531271869955E-5,8.933812569034916E-5,8.802438251150276E-5,8.613562240113869E-5,8.632598739420002E-5,8.62960462894254E-5,8.872474142248946E-5,8.632727176031929E-5,8.610657333541966E-5,8.7051716205776E-5,8.63495073738429E-5,9.285940512423924E-5,8.627834415973065E-5,8.613462629208004E-5,8.65458938521124E-5,8.740435638252816E-5,8.654016834895288E-5,8.611869119365135E-5,8.631920537638888E-5,8.609292340061921E-5,0.14083056109362843,8.683457352192392E-5,8.664960316662185E-5,8.657382417248248E-5,8.68893995232817E-5,8.608978259423458E-5,8.657563915215117E-5,8.797983854642816E-5,8.624406026657901E-5,0.04754629061386483,8.647208079997593E-5,8.714885466411532E-5,8.661623920249916E-5,8.606279091184766E-5,8.616947165202545E-5]}}

{"value":"This is a movie that is bad in every imaginable way. Sure we like to know what happened 12 years from the last movie, and it works on some level. But the new characters are just not interesting. Baby Melody is hideously horrible! Alas, while the logic that humans can't stay underwater forever is maintained, other basic physical logic are ignored. It's chilly if you don't have cold weather garments if you're in the Arctic. I don't know why most comments here Return of Jafar rates worse, I thought this one is more horrible.","finished_norm":["thi","be","a","movi","that","be","bad","in","everi","imagin","wai","sure","we","like","to","know","what","happen","year","from","the","last","movi","and","it","work","on","some","level","but","the","new","charact","be","just","not","interest","babi","melodi","be","hideous","horribl","ala","while","the","logic","that","human","ca","not","stai","underwat","forev","be","maintain","other","basic","physic","logic","be","ignor","it","chilli","if","you","do","not","have","cold","weather","garment","if","you","re","in","the","arctic","i","do","not","know","why","much","comment","here","return","of","jafar","rate","wrong","i","think","thi","on","be","much","horribl"],"filtered":["thi","movi","bad","everi","imagin","wai","sure","like","know","happen","year","last","movi","work","level","new","charact","interest","babi","melodi","hideous","horribl","ala","logic","human","ca","stai","underwat","forev","maintain","basic","physic","logic","ignor","chilli","cold","weather","garment","re","arctic","know","much","comment","return","jafar","rate","wrong","think","thi","much","horribl"],"filtered2":["bad","everi","imagin","wai","sure","like","know","happen","year","last","work","level","new","charact","interest","babi","melodi","hideous","horribl","ala","logic","human","ca","stai","underwat","forev","maintain","basic","physic","logic","ignor","chilli","cold","weather","garment","re","arctic","know","comment","return","jafar","rate","wrong","think","horribl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,9,10,12,25,26,33,48,57,60,68,81,85,87,94,119,144,202,230,280,286,292,340,365,445,488,698,763,970,973,1107,1324,1558,2700,2743,4577,5418,5424,8332],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,9,10,12,25,26,33,48,57,60,68,81,85,87,94,119,144,202,230,280,286,292,340,365,445,488,698,763,970,973,1107,1324,1558,2700,2743,4577,5418,5424,8332],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,1.066728610262888,1.2796387880827016,2.6649848339420377,1.4018535447685214,1.6955116224012472,1.834162586674748,1.838176641236591,2.0064197866819473,1.949757232424728,2.011190219103739,2.115024371522662,2.08112281984698,2.1653408989309972,2.2931108769894046,2.597304642813496,5.424276438599839,2.8028805344481915,2.780700890737216,2.9752256367457734,2.948928684455311,3.008694896185175,3.241201430615691,3.3933092088131493,3.90413483257914,3.7465885637507435,4.086456389373095,8.144543508762276,4.213208095012239,4.364659717870332,4.573751515728891,5.259176650194926,6.0662680901040895,6.1754673820690815,6.255510089742618,6.389041482367141,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.535177890728119E-5,9.470879957068321E-5,9.544507017785039E-5,9.489358754555239E-5,9.489514227014607E-5,9.476249782492524E-5,9.504433477091126E-5,9.472243701897556E-5,9.493540758781803E-5,1.0532565239897734E-4,0.6873240783105286,9.456953412163637E-5,9.633462757926146E-5,9.77088622098681E-5,9.463849323937798E-5,9.43769532767294E-5,9.673106832033547E-5,9.505323970765456E-5,9.475833740174665E-5,9.48368752157072E-5,9.575447760636482E-5,9.514741341521874E-5,9.52557531798662E-5,9.535838057011666E-5,9.609020715092032E-5,9.55876824189846E-5,9.960600699797232E-5,9.459764877702611E-5,9.4600179485667E-5,9.483984850542844E-5,9.685564728316249E-5,9.504773218409811E-5,1.0202568884265605E-4,9.531508742886217E-5,9.470061406355192E-5,0.06383281740566617,9.460572168170919E-5,9.466162670263669E-5,9.437647911928544E-5,9.440096473210347E-5,9.461344983088274E-5,9.561142124648801E-5,9.512557943619089E-5,9.474947948641217E-5,9.590078501306868E-5,9.478584485439518E-5,9.793510779076324E-5,9.649494348425371E-5,9.442442853254613E-5,9.463311229405317E-5,9.460028996539093E-5,9.726269773149906E-5,9.46345202543541E-5,9.439258408360085E-5,0.16315274148904377,9.46588955945619E-5,1.0179523893023571E-4,9.458088436485493E-5,9.442333656819973E-5,9.487418028706413E-5,9.581525241949281E-5,9.486790382038487E-5,9.44058680398395E-5,9.462567764462169E-5,9.437762061950656E-5,9.65613231449662E-5,9.519063951834445E-5,9.498786951903428E-5,9.49047983341178E-5,9.525074141001969E-5,9.437417757422827E-5,9.490678796875718E-5,9.644611306625134E-5,9.454330134254114E-5,9.688319879058431E-5,9.479326422618318E-5,0.07843025419975556,9.495129495025489E-5,9.43445884900205E-5,9.446153508709512E-5]}}

{"value":"What ever possessed Martin Scorcese to remake this film? And not only did he remake it, completely ruin it? The nonsensical decision to make the character played by Robert DeNiro (in his most overdone performance, and that's saying a lot) into a religious fanatic is ridiculous, and exemplary of attitudes harbored by Hollywood (and Mr. Scorcese especially)- attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back. In any case, this movie is awful. <br /><br />","finished_norm":["what","ever","possess","martin","scorces","to","remak","thi","film","and","not","onli","do","he","remak","it","complet","ruin","it","the","nonsens","decis","to","make","the","charact","plai","by","robert","deniro","in","hi","much","overdo","perform","and","that","sai","a","lot","into","a","religi","fanat","be","ridicul","and","exemplari","of","attitud","harbor","by","hollywood","and","mr","scorces","especi","attitud","that","compel","writer","to","think","that","the","well","wai","to","make","a","charact","insan","be","to","tattoo","a","crucifix","on","hi","back","in","ani","case","thi","movi","be","aw","br","br"],"filtered":["ever","possess","martin","scorces","remak","thi","film","onli","remak","complet","ruin","nonsens","decis","make","charact","plai","robert","deniro","hi","much","overdo","perform","sai","lot","religi","fanat","ridicul","exemplari","attitud","harbor","hollywood","mr","scorces","especi","attitud","compel","writer","think","well","wai","make","charact","insan","tattoo","crucifix","hi","back","ani","case","thi","movi","aw","br","br"],"filtered2":["ever","possess","martin","scorces","remak","onli","remak","complet","ruin","nonsens","decis","make","charact","plai","robert","deniro","overdo","perform","lot","religi","fanat","ridicul","exemplari","attitud","harbor","hollywood","mr","scorces","especi","attitud","compel","writer","think","well","wai","make","charact","insan","tattoo","crucifix","back","ani","case","aw"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,11,12,20,27,33,40,44,63,72,103,105,138,267,274,287,288,300,357,483,539,710,905,1232,1254,1285,1304,1317,1483,1821,1977,3158,4622,5313,6254,7707],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,10,11,12,20,27,33,40,44,63,72,103,105,138,267,274,287,288,300,357,483,539,710,905,1232,1254,1285,1304,1317,1483,1821,1977,3158,4622,5313,6254,7707],"values":[1.2399534312410465,2.247774048205673,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,1.3002700588679295,1.4018535447685214,1.6284968758320737,1.604729392502474,1.8729627573220065,1.9209463754160525,2.098582041218749,2.1765612129984904,2.2907365189289424,2.7085302779237206,2.748952192422636,2.841890188081905,2.8015621426949333,2.932274249550174,3.2829611516442836,7.226961979476402,3.6105180246075443,3.6528204042982337,3.9121030022283168,4.470719289830655,4.34596758485818,4.449957298382227,4.4637506205145625,4.597282013139085,4.5432147918688095,9.578346041898381,4.900964426937307,5.521540914662417,6.342521466732247,6.255510089742618,6.868614562629026,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.298206038600009E-5,9.235506061538608E-5,9.30730331465816E-5,9.253525616952042E-5,9.253677225550969E-5,9.240742434027694E-5,9.268225696774329E-5,9.236835914064865E-5,9.257603688425746E-5,1.0270805939634892E-4,0.786497411066012,9.221925624402194E-5,9.394048293055726E-5,9.52805645616703E-5,9.228650156365304E-5,9.203146149120731E-5,9.432707117619303E-5,9.269094059562615E-5,9.240336731351084E-5,9.247995327597478E-5,9.337475106450298E-5,9.278277386254422E-5,0.04840867493404708,9.298849798181058E-5,9.37021369312688E-5,9.321210113428865E-5,9.713056078900887E-5,9.224667218334827E-5,9.224913999785958E-5,9.248285267237382E-5,9.444855405545499E-5,9.268556994713095E-5,9.949010778410023E-5,9.294628077809863E-5,9.234707853757805E-5,9.277332118084992E-5,9.225454445714678E-5,9.230906010532168E-5,9.203099911770372E-5,9.205487620479874E-5,9.226208054343025E-5,9.323524999546051E-5,9.27614825098322E-5,9.239472953844293E-5,9.351742238412551E-5,0.15792056372848215,9.550118740170472E-5,9.409681460396339E-5,9.207775687398653E-5,9.228125434761933E-5,9.224924773189957E-5,9.484548833189028E-5,9.228262731675764E-5,9.204670383534665E-5,9.305704813892136E-5,9.23063968717791E-5,9.926538510017997E-5,9.223032440669743E-5,9.207669204755162E-5,9.251633122757008E-5,9.343401547895833E-5,9.251021074601776E-5,9.205965765367393E-5,9.22740044669112E-5,9.203211224892903E-5,9.416154457220837E-5,9.282492569418436E-5,9.262719501169063E-5,9.254618834332262E-5,9.288353391088573E-5,9.202875477151597E-5,9.254812853080843E-5,9.404919773800238E-5,9.219367541188772E-5,9.447542084237998E-5,9.243742612327888E-5,9.316088777112867E-5,9.259152940794615E-5,9.199990104643497E-5,9.211394124238878E-5]}}

{"value":"How Rick Sloane was allowed to make five movies is harder to believe than cold fusion. This film is absolutely criminal. Before watching this movie I thought Manos: Hands of Fate was the worse piece of crap I ever saw, but at least Manos moves so slowly you might fall asleep, thereby rescuing your eyes from the pain it will suffer. The greatest tragedy of this movie is that the old man that keeps the Hobgoblins \"locked\" up makes it to the final scene. The time I spent watching this movie was an absolute waste of my life.","finished_norm":["how","rick","sloan","be","allow","to","make","five","movi","be","hard","to","believ","than","cold","fusion","thi","film","be","absolut","crimin","befor","watch","thi","movi","i","think","mano","hand","of","fate","be","the","wrong","piec","of","crap","i","ever","see","but","at","littl","mano","move","so","slowli","you","mai","fall","asleep","therebi","rescu","your","ey","from","the","pain","it","will","suffer","the","great","tragedi","of","thi","movi","be","that","the","old","man","that","keep","the","hobgoblin","lock","up","make","it","to","the","final","scene","the","time","i","spend","watch","thi","movi","be","a","absolut","wast","of","my","life"],"filtered":["rick","sloan","allow","make","five","movi","hard","believ","cold","fusion","thi","film","absolut","crimin","befor","watch","thi","movi","think","mano","hand","fate","wrong","piec","crap","ever","see","littl","mano","move","slowli","mai","fall","asleep","therebi","rescu","ey","pain","suffer","great","tragedi","thi","movi","old","man","keep","hobgoblin","lock","make","final","scene","time","spend","watch","thi","movi","absolut","wast","life"],"filtered2":["rick","sloan","allow","make","five","hard","believ","cold","fusion","absolut","crimin","befor","watch","think","mano","hand","fate","wrong","piec","crap","ever","see","littl","mano","move","slowli","mai","fall","asleep","therebi","rescu","ey","pain","suffer","great","tragedi","old","man","keep","hobgoblin","lock","make","final","scene","time","spend","watch","absolut","wast","life"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,12,14,19,25,44,45,46,51,67,75,79,89,91,134,156,170,171,218,222,235,275,281,283,313,459,505,521,633,1033,1107,1189,1318,1346,1374,1697,1880,2661,3669,4435,4948,7631],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,7,8,12,14,19,25,44,45,46,51,67,75,79,89,91,134,156,170,171,218,222,235,275,281,283,313,459,505,521,633,1033,1107,1189,1318,1346,1374,1697,1880,2661,3669,4435,4948,7631],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.066728610262888,1.1175081997259209,1.312380678011735,1.2796387880827016,1.604729392502474,1.8162961064622165,1.655771293751733,1.7139899308309823,1.9570915389266579,1.9742250248702675,1.9469506069506084,1.9940046109572438,2.0105926690411424,2.2443961816702407,2.3451551414151686,2.4071371113909277,2.373087554090762,2.5940874818617203,5.154203870991953,2.6457189377809835,2.7832848715031413,2.832333801361687,2.7678802023081546,2.907069060519773,3.2829611516442836,3.3956930001684253,3.4076979462652486,3.550241531602284,4.2574141875167335,4.213208095012239,4.383707912841026,4.436351646326448,4.416284083275639,4.416284083275639,4.6973654716960676,4.911775343041523,5.541743621979936,6.2980697041614135,12.132536180208179,6.1754673820690815,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.540248224218392E-5,8.482659333895438E-5,8.548603921583918E-5,8.499209997053677E-5,8.499349247040437E-5,8.487468855287589E-5,8.512711776867654E-5,8.483880781412163E-5,8.502955638150139E-5,9.433565122468023E-5,0.5884226541623662,8.470185927341863E-5,8.62827774733528E-5,8.751362025344504E-5,8.47636229855995E-5,8.452937290372702E-5,8.663785237324087E-5,8.513509353704503E-5,8.487096224099475E-5,8.49413051788924E-5,8.576316212557532E-5,8.521944087151636E-5,8.531647613328556E-5,8.540839506729884E-5,8.606386062114254E-5,8.561377085892499E-5,8.921281114357483E-5,8.472704035955233E-5,8.47293070063023E-5,8.494396822645721E-5,8.674943238551237E-5,8.51301606853655E-5,9.138001597331669E-5,8.536961926500584E-5,8.481926193270864E-5,8.521075873996123E-5,8.473427091263421E-5,8.478434263244608E-5,8.452894822132306E-5,8.455087893030244E-5,8.474119268305237E-5,8.563503270445681E-5,8.51998851167358E-5,8.486302858767726E-5,8.589420336933728E-5,8.489559948178108E-5,8.771625867745974E-5,8.642636552578499E-5,8.457189444593941E-5,8.475880350459122E-5,8.472940595823345E-5,8.711400994331064E-5,8.476006455400191E-5,8.454337274433375E-5,8.547135725109052E-5,8.478189649655295E-5,0.3148162647344273,8.471202519749498E-5,8.45709164204975E-5,8.497471772484187E-5,8.581759550855376E-5,8.496909616392018E-5,8.455527061189091E-5,8.47521446092531E-5,8.45299706139148E-5,8.648581892938382E-5,8.525815663064429E-5,8.507654427412838E-5,8.500214099108564E-5,8.531198730685545E-5,8.452688682652658E-5,8.500392302115269E-5,8.638263022316014E-5,8.467836370284282E-5,8.6774109084262E-5,8.490224469359185E-5,8.556673223319788E-5,0.09017848302575689,8.450038515799375E-5,8.460512918893271E-5]}}

{"value":"After the overrated success of Amenabar and Balaguero, Spanish Horror Movies spread like a disease in the increasingly sad world of horror movies. The result is all in films like El segundo nombre, a TV-like production bad written, but acted and directed even worse. I didn't read the Ramsey Campbell book, but I'm sure that the author of The Doll Who Ate Its Mother didn't have much in common with this terrible production. Avoid it at any cost, unless you're searching for a quiet sleepy night in a fresh movie theater. 2/10","finished_norm":["after","the","overr","success","of","amenabar","and","balaguero","spanish","horror","movi","spread","like","a","diseas","in","the","increasingli","sad","world","of","horror","movi","the","result","be","all","in","film","like","el","segundo","nombr","a","tvlike","product","bad","write","but","act","and","direct","even","wrong","i","do","not","read","the","ramsei","campbel","book","but","i","be","sure","that","the","author","of","the","doll","who","eat","it","mother","do","not","have","much","in","common","with","thi","terribl","product","avoid","it","at","ani","cost","unless","you","re","search","for","a","quiet","sleepi","night","in","a","fresh","movi","theater"],"filtered":["overr","success","amenabar","balaguero","spanish","horror","movi","spread","like","diseas","increasingli","sad","world","horror","movi","result","film","like","el","segundo","nombr","tvlike","product","bad","write","act","direct","even","wrong","read","ramsei","campbel","book","sure","author","doll","eat","mother","much","common","thi","terribl","product","avoid","ani","cost","unless","re","search","quiet","sleepi","night","fresh","movi","theater"],"filtered2":["overr","success","amenabar","balaguero","spanish","horror","spread","like","diseas","increasingli","sad","world","horror","result","like","el","segundo","nombr","tvlike","product","bad","write","act","direct","even","wrong","read","ramsei","campbel","book","sure","author","doll","eat","mother","common","terribl","product","avoid","ani","cost","unless","re","search","quiet","sleepi","night","fresh","theater"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,9,21,25,27,65,68,83,102,119,145,151,165,166,190,210,335,397,424,447,455,460,532,599,837,939,1089,1112,1658,1668,1757,2111,2247,2607,2813,3195,4062,4609,5466],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,9,21,25,27,65,68,83,102,119,145,151,165,166,190,210,335,397,424,447,455,460,532,599,837,939,1089,1112,1658,1668,1757,2111,2247,2607,2813,3195,4062,4609,5466],"values":[1.2920765891153156,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,1.162015545335049,1.2796387880827016,1.3002700588679295,1.9073850067444174,2.0064197866819473,4.584637595480144,2.087553710177271,2.1653408989309972,2.34599021453259,2.8002454868101863,2.448847599972298,2.4423870329693536,5.116663665627972,2.687151791517189,2.908534262247101,3.3176717946075294,3.212973749990824,3.2070272508030975,3.2787058260741455,3.216957819005698,3.4446025032006995,3.6254214301101193,3.7881170224473255,3.969732115064953,4.2078172463773615,4.2574141875167335,4.637773374493822,4.9676558014359795,4.944927550358424,4.9909126636002465,5.014723312293965,5.3064295350454715,5.373120909544144,5.501738287366237,6.1754673820690815,6.1754673820690815,6.2980697041614135]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[0.07078289236407785,8.741597915750696E-5,8.809555504002437E-5,8.758653798448973E-5,8.758797299130317E-5,8.746554250848275E-5,8.77256772869596E-5,8.742856648731253E-5,8.762513777626864E-5,0.13330401937623754,0.7521504764084312,8.728743750513228E-5,8.891661424058071E-5,9.018502928090629E-5,8.735108659398721E-5,8.71096858790866E-5,8.928252802806408E-5,8.77338965207402E-5,8.74617024485568E-5,8.753419264946075E-5,8.83811373031805E-5,8.782081861134774E-5,8.792081593631947E-5,8.801554075437008E-5,8.869101481194904E-5,8.822718577291407E-5,9.19360890557894E-5,8.73133872599672E-5,8.731572309755366E-5,8.753693698824953E-5,8.939751409131602E-5,8.772881309061964E-5,9.41694491940394E-5,8.797558129600167E-5,8.740842395541354E-5,8.781187145219409E-5,8.732083853028966E-5,8.737243872125768E-5,8.710924823298162E-5,8.713184839082823E-5,8.732797159216082E-5,8.824909664983015E-5,8.780066590469034E-5,8.745352661541597E-5,8.851617866441607E-5,8.748709175681853E-5,9.039385337194808E-5,8.90645854098168E-5,8.715350541847242E-5,8.73461199952499E-5,8.731582507005557E-5,8.977322061139801E-5,8.734741953899746E-5,8.712411307374942E-5,8.808042489894549E-5,8.736991791550757E-5,0.037076660725401674,8.729791375051944E-5,8.715249753818064E-5,8.756862513466791E-5,8.843723229986274E-5,8.756283197201667E-5,8.713637413129584E-5,8.73392578328881E-5,8.711030183475875E-5,8.912585366644795E-5,8.786071619369519E-5,8.767356000426173E-5,8.759688551358963E-5,8.7916190085602E-5,8.710712391279533E-5,8.759872194126008E-5,8.901951505920843E-5,8.726322471729178E-5,8.942294406202056E-5,8.749393981795458E-5,8.817871126316065E-5,8.763980177106052E-5,8.707981326394199E-5,8.71877546731749E-5]}}

{"value":"There have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that I really liked. This was not one of them.<br /><br />It was overacted and used camera techniques that made me feel like I was watching a soap opera. It was ludicrously predictable and took most of the movie to get going then left you asking \"that's it?\". Once I decided not to take the movie too seriously and watch it from a purely corny point of view it became more enjoyable. This is one movie that would have wound up on MST3000 if it was still on.","finished_norm":["there","have","be","plenti","of","unknown","movi","or","movi","give","bad","review","that","i","realli","like","thi","be","not","on","of","thembr","br","it","be","overact","and","us","camera","techniqu","that","make","me","feel","like","i","be","watch","a","soap","opu","it","be","ludicr","predict","and","take","much","of","the","movi","to","get","go","then","leav","you","ask","that","it","onc","i","decid","not","to","take","the","movi","too","serious","and","watch","it","from","a","pure","corni","point","of","view","it","becom","much","enjoy","thi","be","on","movi","that","would","have","wind","up","on","mst","if","it","be","still","on"],"filtered":["plenti","unknown","movi","movi","give","bad","review","realli","like","thi","thembr","br","overact","us","camera","techniqu","make","feel","like","watch","soap","opu","ludicr","predict","take","much","movi","get","go","leav","ask","onc","decid","take","movi","serious","watch","pure","corni","point","view","becom","much","enjoy","thi","movi","wind","mst","still"],"filtered2":["plenti","unknown","give","bad","review","realli","like","thembr","overact","us","camera","techniqu","make","feel","like","watch","soap","opu","ludicr","predict","take","get","go","leav","ask","onc","decid","take","serious","watch","pure","corni","point","view","becom","enjoy","wind","mst","still"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,7,9,13,30,31,43,56,64,66,74,115,176,231,236,249,306,312,337,371,725,736,887,1009,1200,1343,1369,1394,1415,1486,1511,1797,5167],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,4,6,7,9,13,30,31,43,56,64,66,74,115,176,231,236,249,306,312,337,371,725,736,887,1009,1200,1343,1369,1394,1415,1486,1511,1797,5167],"values":[0.6199767156205233,1.2920765891153156,0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,1.1317941569733974,1.3364419891718522,2.814133962290301,1.6608112036218214,1.8610609350701788,1.883428577602134,1.929723173391612,1.9486336368009016,2.201553588425805,2.5040471493269134,2.7049353070058615,2.617923930016232,2.6754694156628323,2.8739486825973213,2.8824835850471584,2.973659465713028,3.0466846007279185,3.6466665387238555,3.68099128126493,3.9323057095458362,4.096025840389245,4.499089986959872,4.520909034354511,4.383707912841026,4.403125998698128,4.4919214974812585,4.566029469634981,4.566029469634981,4.798834931860927,6.342521466732247]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.1811805900477585E-4,1.1732156131915866E-4,1.1823362458654059E-4,1.1755046944409457E-4,1.1755239537618936E-4,1.173880806189106E-4,1.1773720921826344E-4,1.1733845485738657E-4,1.1760227447884614E-4,0.20729361695463605,0.6713965890531737,1.1714904472097504E-4,1.1933557354682354E-4,1.2103792172579397E-4,1.1723446858229849E-4,1.1691048309304745E-4,1.1982666885078856E-4,0.06725912526162632,1.1738292684919465E-4,1.1748021642522363E-4,1.1861690642266996E-4,1.1786489901629314E-4,1.1799910608468602E-4,1.1812623688681713E-4,1.1903279506793596E-4,1.1841028706002703E-4,1.2338803058154795E-4,1.1718387205783524E-4,1.1718700700084306E-4,1.1748389962038533E-4,0.04507092090128337,1.1774141780100692E-4,1.2638543793124256E-4,1.1807260703458151E-4,1.1731142143267308E-4,1.1785289097507007E-4,1.1719387245680655E-4,1.17263125412926E-4,1.1690989572532779E-4,1.1694022754601065E-4,1.1720344578611975E-4,1.1843969379223369E-4,1.1783785193596938E-4,1.1737195400969309E-4,1.1879814632292064E-4,1.1741700200701806E-4,1.2131818591362552E-4,1.1953416662754302E-4,1.1696929358543775E-4,1.1722780287742479E-4,1.1718714385880943E-4,1.2048523059841528E-4,1.1722954700364675E-4,1.1692984592601704E-4,1.1821331832455667E-4,1.1725974222292762E-4,1.2609996558175047E-4,1.1716310495890213E-4,1.1696794090266059E-4,1.1752642849038079E-4,1.1869219188713976E-4,1.1751865344863476E-4,1.1694630157209722E-4,1.1721859312412715E-4,1.1691130977121154E-4,1.1961639515825956E-4,1.1791844582431352E-4,1.1766726226992795E-4,1.1756435693104485E-4,1.1799289769997384E-4,1.1690704466121571E-4,1.1756682161271545E-4,1.1947367741317354E-4,1.1711654857895713E-4,1.2001512213469372E-4,1.1742619283496776E-4,1.1834522910125036E-4,1.1762195512282838E-4,1.16870390859531E-4,1.1701525973572784E-4]}}

{"value":"Ok so I was bored and I watched it all the way through.<br /><br />This film is mild, inoffensive and lacklustre. The story is so sugary it rots your teeth on the opening titles. A tail of two 'traumatised' children learning about 'God' the fairy story way which frankly left me rather traumatised. It uses the Irish 'blarney' in such a stereotypical way one hopes no true Irish ever see it. Aimed at children who frankly would switch off after the first attempt at an 'OIRISH' accent. All in all why do they pump these out.","finished_norm":["okai","so","i","be","bore","and","i","watch","it","all","the","wai","throughbr","br","thi","film","be","mild","inoffens","and","lacklustr","the","stori","be","so","sugari","it","rot","your","tooth","on","the","open","titl","a","tail","of","two","traumatis","child","learn","about","god","the","fairi","stori","wai","which","frankli","leav","me","rather","traumatis","it","us","the","irish","blarnei","in","such","a","stereotyp","wai","on","hope","no","true","irish","ever","see","it","aim","at","child","who","frankli","would","switch","off","after","the","attempt","at","a","oirish","accent","all","in","all","why","do","thei","pump","thi","out"],"filtered":["okai","bore","watch","wai","throughbr","br","thi","film","mild","inoffens","lacklustr","stori","sugari","rot","tooth","open","titl","tail","two","traumatis","child","learn","god","fairi","stori","wai","frankli","leav","rather","traumatis","us","irish","blarnei","stereotyp","wai","hope","true","irish","ever","see","aim","child","frankli","switch","attempt","oirish","accent","thei","pump","thi"],"filtered2":["okai","bore","watch","wai","throughbr","mild","inoffens","lacklustr","stori","sugari","rot","tooth","open","titl","tail","two","traumatis","child","learn","god","fairi","stori","wai","frankli","leav","rather","traumatis","us","irish","blarnei","stereotyp","wai","hope","true","irish","ever","see","aim","child","frankli","switch","attempt","oirish","accent","pump"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,17,33,44,47,56,74,108,160,177,180,181,191,242,264,304,352,430,559,604,1205,1212,1332,1579,2288,2500,2520,3163,3361,4560,5204,7489,8000],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,17,33,44,47,56,74,108,160,177,180,181,191,242,264,304,352,430,559,604,1205,1212,1332,1579,2288,2500,2520,3163,3361,4560,5204,7489,8000],"values":[0.6557002054693947,0.9609497720722932,2.5541073880211935,4.205560634305565,1.604729392502474,1.7064694353107215,1.8610609350701788,1.9486336368009016,2.138507503627933,2.3722295531801256,2.458149992634611,5.419462958538709,2.4442286541160034,2.5460113484259455,2.689504733779216,2.757740698455715,2.871119826396843,3.1236456418640466,3.2189558216683714,3.5727776966246974,3.5727776966246974,4.339813719283801,4.550761997504193,8.767415825682052,4.605250182788262,5.5623629091826725,5.156897801074508,10.852461469716184,5.501738287366237,5.719991853386255,5.967828017290836,6.1754673820690815,6.794506590475304,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.052122923162584E-5,8.991082342078113E-5,9.060979433848888E-5,9.008624998150262E-5,9.008772594328277E-5,8.996180130538156E-5,9.022936030727862E-5,8.99237699918588E-5,9.012595140790269E-5,9.998982330522965E-5,0.4862964464424209,8.97786132010906E-5,0.06549512409025353,9.275890198819791E-5,8.984407882927534E-5,8.959578855946126E-5,9.18306434299414E-5,9.023781411725963E-5,8.995785165048717E-5,9.003241071527175E-5,9.090352709401258E-5,9.03272169565952E-5,9.043006819631973E-5,9.052749645224498E-5,9.12222484792957E-5,9.074518180077731E-5,9.455993685317464E-5,8.980530355961844E-5,8.980770606180168E-5,9.003523337724526E-5,9.194891118520236E-5,9.023258560649597E-5,9.685703689095375E-5,0.12825588264206472,8.990305259389252E-5,9.031801444631579E-5,8.981296748853258E-5,8.98660403443573E-5,8.95953384229754E-5,8.961858358731505E-5,8.982030412735456E-5,9.076771801217004E-5,9.030648909348381E-5,8.994944247979632E-5,0.038765382336228754,8.99839655673465E-5,9.297368590020826E-5,9.160648074877087E-5,8.96408587046003E-5,8.98389704842522E-5,8.980781094458971E-5,0.10156171118802698,8.984030711686263E-5,8.961062750497544E-5,9.05942323845305E-5,8.98634475950355E-5,9.663826164011239E-5,8.978938843758851E-5,8.96398220594947E-5,9.006782590054151E-5,9.09612230369065E-5,9.006186740154392E-5,8.962323849201272E-5,8.983191247638746E-5,8.959642209445347E-5,9.16694975959921E-5,9.03682532123911E-5,9.01757556019721E-5,9.009689282816188E-5,9.042531032423459E-5,8.959315347488011E-5,9.009878166731457E-5,9.156012409436835E-5,8.97537093824406E-5,0.1729188299238704,8.999100907153776E-5,9.069532383283079E-5,9.014103391180052E-5,8.956506338253972E-5,8.967608542998305E-5]}}

{"value":"The Good: I liked this movie because it was the first horror movie I've seen in a long time that actually scared me. The acting wasn't too bad, and the \"Cupid\" killer was believable and disturbing.<br /><br />The Bad: The story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak. There just wasn't much to it. The ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore.<br /><br />Overall: A good scare, but a bad story.<br /><br />** out of *****","finished_norm":["the","good","i","like","thi","movi","becaus","it","be","the","horror","movi","i","have","see","in","a","long","time","that","actual","scare","me","the","act","be","not","too","bad","and","the","cupid","killer","be","believ","and","disturbingbr","br","the","bad","the","stori","line","and","plot","of","thi","movi","be","incredibli","weak","there","just","be","not","much","to","it","the","wai","the","killer","kill","hi","victim","be","veri","horrifi","and","disgust","i","do","not","recommend","thi","movi","to","anyon","who","can","not","handl","gorebr","br","overal","a","good","scare","but","a","bad","storybr","br","out","of"],"filtered":["good","like","thi","movi","becaus","horror","movi","see","long","time","actual","scare","act","bad","cupid","killer","believ","disturbingbr","br","bad","stori","line","plot","thi","movi","incredibli","weak","much","wai","killer","kill","hi","victim","veri","horrifi","disgust","recommend","thi","movi","anyon","handl","gorebr","br","overal","good","scare","bad","storybr","br"],"filtered2":["good","like","becaus","horror","see","long","time","actual","scare","act","bad","cupid","killer","believ","disturbingbr","bad","stori","line","plot","incredibli","weak","wai","killer","kill","victim","veri","horrifi","disgust","recommend","anyon","handl","gorebr","overal","good","scare","bad","storybr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,9,15,17,21,22,32,33,52,76,83,91,99,107,158,252,298,379,412,535,623,687,945,963,1930,2563,8052,8534],"values":[1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,2,3,8,9,15,17,21,22,32,33,52,76,83,91,99,107,158,252,298,379,412,535,623,687,945,963,1930,2563,8052,8534],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,0.9418936859054116,3.205071257016622,1.2000607798565692,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.2979240167361772,1.3711311285073675,1.4018535447685214,1.7122153074726136,2.1337665533324026,2.292318797740072,2.0105926690411424,2.056430207256609,2.1439533986393955,2.3106972614914807,6.0866465060504265,2.7819920465008363,3.1272886331425473,3.107414446935464,3.4986697244709752,7.215127625420226,3.604618302480356,3.9782428047328615,4.035401218572811,4.848596441419991,5.259176650194926,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.3478799514140725E-4,1.3387908817930782E-4,1.3491987042961185E-4,1.3414030198092002E-4,1.3414249971874286E-4,1.3395499531092953E-4,1.34353396235816E-4,1.3389836589321348E-4,1.3419941823148516E-4,1.4888692887023668E-4,0.7481120387317504,1.3368222440933303E-4,1.361773368353093E-4,1.3811993646833216E-4,1.3377970409281275E-4,1.3340999471120763E-4,1.3673774014706818E-4,1.3436598413490132E-4,1.3394911419255283E-4,1.3406013419247148E-4,1.3535724461863322E-4,1.344991068242006E-4,1.3465225446169902E-4,1.34797327163404E-4,1.3583182739767478E-4,1.3512146517997086E-4,0.04568997627941987,1.3372196690892245E-4,1.3372554428469775E-4,1.3406433719492295E-4,1.3691384329720004E-4,1.3435819877350718E-4,1.4422214466910743E-4,1.347361285598757E-4,1.3386751725626806E-4,1.3448540409478167E-4,1.3373337865865248E-4,1.338124052460482E-4,1.3340932444860754E-4,1.334439369823156E-4,1.3374430306662045E-4,1.3515502206797928E-4,1.344682426044362E-4,1.3393659276230002E-4,1.3556406280545622E-4,1.339879983584953E-4,0.1958100050430432,1.3640395724733327E-4,1.3347710509576148E-4,1.3377209766070832E-4,1.3372570045735297E-4,1.3748924434877401E-4,1.3377408793449635E-4,1.334320902100519E-4,1.3489669835613983E-4,1.3380854458832232E-4,1.4389638376530872E-4,1.336982689608383E-4,1.3347556150961445E-4,1.3411286814074628E-4,1.3544315507893603E-4,1.3410399581167216E-4,1.3345086823233395E-4,1.3376158814003725E-4,1.3341093805800235E-4,1.3649779064497028E-4,1.3456021066352968E-4,1.342735777134678E-4,1.3415614940119895E-4,1.3464516989109676E-4,1.3340607101539908E-4,1.3415896192202635E-4,1.3633493122369866E-4,1.3364514210482067E-4,1.3695278973837889E-4,1.3399848628289457E-4,1.3504722562756552E-4,1.34221876393834E-4,1.3336424428301777E-4,1.3352955842334046E-4]}}

{"value":"This is some of the worst acting I have ever seen. I love Almereyda's Nadja, but this is just absolute dreck. Aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material. Jared Harris is particularly bad, but no one in this is remotely good. The plot is a joke, but not the haha kind. I don't even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad. Please erase the last hour and a half of my life.
