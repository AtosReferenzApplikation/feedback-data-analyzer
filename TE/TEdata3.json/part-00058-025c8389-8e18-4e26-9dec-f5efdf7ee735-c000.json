{"value":"Hi, I'm a friend of werewolf movies, and when i saw the title of Darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like \"hmm, simple and nice name to it at least. Althou... i wonder why i haven't heard of it before.\"<br /><br />First of all, the movie starts with tits. Lots of tits. Tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to. Who cares about a werewolf effect, just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots!<br /><br />So, about the mysterious darkwolf character (a little spoilers ahead, but who really cares...) He's your average everyday biker. Not even super-tough looking, but like the old wise woman says in the movie \"he is far more powerful and dangerous than you've ever faced before.\" Just by describing her a tattooed biker-type of a guy. Pretty original. I even had look twice when they first used the \"red glowing eyes\" SPECIAL EFFECT! I mean my god, that \"lets-plant-red-dots-on-eyes-with-computer\" effect has been used since the seventies. It looks plain ugly here! And don't get me started with the werewolf 3D-CGI. As said before, like an bad and old video game.<br /><br />And finally, as i do like werewolf films, like i said. They prettymuch always build a werewolf-legend of their own. Darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well, about some silly legends of hybrid-werewolves and the ancient bloodline. BUT. It almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement \"the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched\" starts random-slashing. Which just doesn't make any sense, why even bother telling us the rules of killing, when they aren't even gonna play by them... Aplus the wolf-point-of-view shots are made with a sony handycam or something, filming mostly the floor and walls. Just add growling noises and you've got a super werewolf effect. The gore is partially OK. But when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand, just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims, it just doesn't do the trick for me...<br /><br />Truly, WHO gives money to make these heaps of junk straight-to-video horrortitles, they aren't even funny-kind of bad movies, just sad.","finished_norm":["hello","i","be","a","friend","of","werewolf","movi","and","when","i","see","the","titl","of","darkwolf","hit","the","shelv","i","be","like","hmm","simpl","and","nice","name","to","it","at","littl","althou","i","wonder","why","i","have","not","hear","of","it","beforebr","br","of","all","the","movi","start","with","tit","lot","of","tit","tit","be","pretti","much","all","thi","movi","budget","go","to","who","care","about","a","werewolf","effect","just","pai","the","actress","enough","to","get","topless","shotsbr","br","so","about","the","mysteri","darkwolf","charact","a","littl","spoiler","ahead","but","who","realli","care","he","your","averag","everydai","biker","not","even","supertough","look","but","like","the","old","wise","woman","sai","in","the","movi","he","be","far","much","power","and","danger","than","you","have","ever","face","befor","just","by","describ","her","a","tattoo","bikertyp","of","a","gui","pretti","origin","i","even","have","look","twice","when","thei","us","the","red","glow","ey","special","effect","i","mean","my","god","that","letsplantreddotsoneyeswithcomput","effect","have","be","us","sinc","the","seventi","it","look","plain","ugli","here","and","do","not","get","me","start","with","the","werewolf","dcgi","a","sai","befor","like","a","bad","and","old","video","gamebr","br","and","final","a","i","do","like","werewolf","film","like","i","sai","thei","prettymuch","alwai","build","a","werewolflegend","of","their","own","darkwolf","doe","build","the","werewolfworld","a","good","about","some","silli","legend","of","hybridwerewolv","and","the","ancient","bloodlin","but","it","almost","instantli","after","creat","the","rule","of","engag","the","darkwolf","kill","anyon","the","girl","have","touch","start","randomslash","which","just","doe","not","make","ani","sens","why","even","bother","tell","u","the","rule","of","kill","when","thei","be","not","even","gonna","plai","by","them","aplu","the","wolfpointofview","shot","be","make","with","a","soni","handycam","or","someth","film","mostli","the","floor","and","wall","just","add","growl","nois","and","you","have","get","a","super","werewolf","effect","the","gore","be","partial","okai","but","when","the","wolf","slash","everyon","with","a","open","hand","just","by","basic","lai","the","hand","on","top","of","the","victim","it","just","doe","not","do","the","trick","for","mebr","br","truli","who","give","monei","to","make","thi","heap","of","junk","straighttovideo","horrortitl","thei","be","not","even","funnykind","of","bad","movi","just","sad"],"filtered":["hello","friend","werewolf","movi","see","titl","darkwolf","hit","shelv","like","hmm","simpl","nice","name","littl","althou","wonder","hear","beforebr","br","movi","start","tit","lot","tit","tit","pretti","much","thi","movi","budget","go","care","werewolf","effect","pai","actress","enough","get","topless","shotsbr","br","mysteri","darkwolf","charact","littl","spoiler","ahead","realli","care","averag","everydai","biker","even","supertough","look","like","old","wise","woman","sai","movi","far","much","power","danger","ever","face","befor","describ","tattoo","bikertyp","gui","pretti","origin","even","look","twice","thei","us","red","glow","ey","special","effect","mean","god","letsplantreddotsoneyeswithcomput","effect","us","sinc","seventi","look","plain","ugli","get","start","werewolf","dcgi","sai","befor","like","bad","old","video","gamebr","br","final","like","werewolf","film","like","sai","thei","prettymuch","alwai","build","werewolflegend","darkwolf","doe","build","werewolfworld","good","silli","legend","hybridwerewolv","ancient","bloodlin","almost","instantli","creat","rule","engag","darkwolf","kill","anyon","girl","touch","start","randomslash","doe","make","ani","sens","even","bother","tell","u","rule","kill","thei","even","gonna","plai","aplu","wolfpointofview","shot","make","soni","handycam","someth","film","mostli","floor","wall","add","growl","nois","get","super","werewolf","effect","gore","partial","okai","wolf","slash","everyon","open","hand","basic","lai","hand","top","victim","doe","trick","mebr","br","truli","give","monei","make","thi","heap","junk","straighttovideo","horrortitl","thei","even","funnykind","bad","movi","sad"],"filtered2":["hello","friend","werewolf","see","titl","darkwolf","hit","shelv","like","hmm","simpl","nice","name","littl","althou","wonder","hear","beforebr","start","tit","lot","tit","tit","pretti","budget","go","care","werewolf","effect","pai","actress","enough","get","topless","shotsbr","mysteri","darkwolf","charact","littl","spoiler","ahead","realli","care","averag","everydai","biker","even","supertough","look","like","old","wise","woman","far","power","danger","ever","face","befor","describ","tattoo","bikertyp","gui","pretti","origin","even","look","twice","us","red","glow","ey","special","effect","mean","god","letsplantreddotsoneyeswithcomput","effect","us","sinc","seventi","look","plain","ugli","get","start","werewolf","dcgi","befor"

{"value":"This British-Spanish co-production is one of the countless films shot in Spain in the wake of the unexpected phenomenal success enjoyed by the Italian \"Spaghetti\" Westerns and, as is typical of such genre efforts, features an eclectic assortment of established and emerging international stars: Robert Shaw, Telly Savalas, Stella Stevens, Martin Landau, Fernando Rey, Michael Craig, Al Lettieri, Dudley Sutton, Antonio Mayans, etc. Ironically, however, this incoherent mess of a movie serves as a shining example as to why that most American of film genres became a dying breed in the 1970s and is nowadays practically (or is that officially?) extinct.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this film, not only because the Western is one of my favorite types of movies but also because it had all the qualities, including an intriguing premise, to be a good one - not to mention the fact that my father had purchased a paperback edition of A TOWN CALLED BASTARD's novelization following its original release! As it is, the film's sole virtue (if, indeed, it can even be called that) is its sheer eccentricity: for instance, Stevens, playing a widow out for revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband, sleeps inside a coffin(!) driven around in a carriage by her dumb manservant(?) Sutton; Savalas, as a blood-thirsty renegade, who at first appears to be the film's main villain, is unceremoniously dispatched by his own henchman Lettieri very early on in the picture; the villain of the piece, then, turns out to be Landau who, in the film's very first scene, is seen pillaging side-by-side our legendary hero-turned-priest Shaw!; Fernando Rey, playing a blind peasant, is the only one who can identify rebel Shaw who, in the end turns out to have been merely a front for...well, nevermind! As you can see, the plot is very confusing and it gets stranger from there! The production team responsible for this film were also behind other Western fare around the same period of time, like CUSTER OF THE WEST (1967), BAD MAN'S RIVER (1971), CAPTAIN APACHE (1971) and PANCHO VILLA (1972).","finished_norm":["thi","britishspanish","coproduct","be","on","of","the","countless","film","shoot","in","spain","in","the","wake","of","the","unexpect","phenomen","success","enjoi","by","the","italian","spaghetti","western","and","a","be","typic","of","such","genr","effort","featur","a","eclect","assort","of","establish","and","emerg","intern","star","robert","shaw","telli","savala","stella","steven","martin","landau","fernando","rei","michael","craig","al","lettieri","dudlei","sutton","antonio","mayan","etc","iron","howev","thi","incoher","mess","of","a","movi","serv","a","a","shine","exampl","a","to","why","that","much","american","of","film","genr","becom","a","dye","bre","in","the","and","be","nowadai","practic","or","be","that","offici","extinctbr","br","i","realli","want","to","like","thi","film","not","onli","becaus","the","western","be","on","of","my","favorit","typ","of","movi","but","conjur","becaus","it","have","all","the","qualiti","includ","a","intrigu","premis","to","be","a","good","on","not","to","mention","the","fact","that","my","father","have","purchas","a","paperback","edit","of","a","town","call","bastard","novel","follow","it","origin","releas","a","it","be","the","film","sole","virtu","if","ind","it","can","even","be","call","that","be","it","sheer","eccentr","for","instanc","steven","plai","a","widow","out","for","reveng","on","the","man","who","betrai","her","revolutionari","husband","sleep","insid","a","coffin","drive","around","in","a","carriag","by","her","dumb","manserv","sutton","savala","a","a","bloodthirsti","renegad","who","at","appear","to","be","the","film","main","villain","be","unceremoni","dispatch","by","hi","own","henchman","lettieri","veri","earli","on","in","the","pictur","the","villain","of","the","piec","then","turn","out","to","be","landau","who","in","the","film","veri","scene","be","see","pillag","sidebysid","our","legendari","heroturnedpriest","shaw","fernando","rei","plai","a","blind","peasant","be","the","onli","on","who","can","identifi","rebel","shaw","who","in","the","end","turn","out","to","have","be","mere","a","front","forwel","nevermind","a","you","can","see","the","plot","be","veri","confus","and","it","get","strang","from","there","the","product","team","respons","for","thi","film","be","conjur","behind","other","western","fare","around","the","same","period","of","time","like","custer","of","the","west","bad","man","river","captain","apach","and","pancho","villa"],"filtered":["thi","britishspanish","coproduct","countless","film","shoot","spain","wake","unexpect","phenomen","success","enjoi","italian","spaghetti","western","typic","genr","effort","featur","eclect","assort","establish","emerg","intern","star","robert","shaw","telli","savala","stella","steven","martin","landau","fernando","rei","michael","craig","al","lettieri","dudlei","sutton","antonio","mayan","etc","iron","howev","thi","incoher","mess","movi","serv","shine","exampl","much","american","film","genr","becom","dye","bre","nowadai","practic","offici","extinctbr","br","realli","want","like","thi","film","onli","becaus","western","favorit","typ","movi","conjur","becaus","qualiti","includ","intrigu","premis","good","mention","fact","father","purchas","paperback","edit","town","call","bastard","novel","follow","origin","releas","film","sole","virtu","ind","even","call","sheer","eccentr","instanc","steven","plai","widow","reveng","man","betrai","revolutionari","husband","sleep","insid","coffin","drive","around","carriag","dumb","manserv","sutton","savala","bloodthirsti","renegad","appear","film","main","villain","unceremoni","dispatch","hi","henchman","lettieri","veri","earli","pictur","villain","piec","turn","landau","film","veri","scene","see","pillag","sidebysid","legendari","heroturnedpriest","shaw","fernando","rei","plai","blind","peasant","onli","identifi","rebel","shaw","end","turn","mere","front","forwel","nevermind","see","plot","veri","confus","get","strang","product","team","respons","thi","film","conjur","behind","western","fare","around","period","time","like","custer","west","bad","man","river","captain","apach","pancho","villa"],"filtered2":["britishspanish","coproduct","countless","shoot","spain","wake","unexpect","phenomen","success","enjoi","italian","spaghetti","western","typic","genr","effort","featur","eclect","assort","establish","emerg","intern","star","robert","shaw","telli","savala","stella","steven","martin","landau","fernando","rei","michael","craig","al","lettieri","dudlei","sutton","antonio","mayan","etc","iron","howev","incoher","mess","serv","shine","exampl","american","genr","becom","dye","bre","nowadai","practic","offici","extinctbr","realli","want","like","onli","becaus","western","favorit","typ","conjur","becaus","qualiti","includ","intrigu","premis","good","mention","fact","father","purchas","paperback","edit","town","call","bastard","novel","follow","origin","releas","sole","virtu","ind","even","call","sheer","eccentr","instanc","steven","plai",

{"value":"Literally every aspect of this science-fiction low-budget flick falls under the categories that have been classified for its predecessors, contemporaries, and those to follow. Bad special effects, a weak storyline, ridiculous amounts of blood and gore, annoying and pointless characters, all that you can expect. \"Attack of the Sabretooth\" is about a new vacation resort where the proprietors are genetically engineering Smilodon cats for an attraction. The cats escape and begin to kill people, the guy running the show wants to save them and not warn the unsuspecting visitors about them, and there is a band of visitors and some employees who rebel and plan to kill the cats.<br /><br />Special effects-wise, the film is about an average achievement given its budget. The sabretooths are portrayed through poor CGI. Amazingly, though, the cats look more realistic in an up-close, detailed shot rather than the longer, more distant shots where the CGI is better concealed. Their attacks are recklessly bloody and distasteful. Just as you'd expect, they attack, rip off some arms and legs, and leave very little behind. This is part of the reason why the film descends into poor schlock.<br /><br />The plot and characters are just as horrendous. We have some college kids who come to the island and they plan a scavenger hunt. And take it very, VERY seriously. Even so much as to trespass on private property, tamper with security systems, and steal. Why are they taking a simple game so seriously? Did I miss something? Was there money involved? Or were they sent to do it? I don't know, I could barely follow the film. But it seemed to me like they were just doing it for the fun of doing it. Even so, they went too far for normal.<br /><br />\"Attack of the Sabretooth\" is a very poor film. Even for a low-budget sci-fi flick, it is a very poor and cheap example. It will bore most viewers to tears, might be attractive for some, and will make you chuckle and laugh all the way through. And keep in mind, this is not a comedy, this is a cheap horror flick, so it's not suppose to be comical.","finished_norm":["liter","everi","aspect","of","thi","sciencefict","lowbudget","flick","fall","under","the","categori","that","have","be","classifi","for","it","predecessor","contemporari","and","that","to","follow","bad","special","effect","a","weak","storylin","ridicul","amount","of","blood","and","gore","annoi","and","pointless","charact","all","that","you","can","expect","attack","of","the","sabretooth","be","about","a","new","vacat","resort","where","the","proprietor","be","genet","engin","smilodon","cat","for","a","attract","the","cat","escap","and","begin","to","kill","peopl","the","gui","run","the","show","want","to","save","them","and","not","warn","the","unsuspect","visitor","about","them","and","there","be","a","band","of","visitor","and","some","employe","who","rebel","and","plan","to","kill","the","catsbr","br","special","effectswis","the","film","be","about","a","averag","achiev","give","it","budget","the","sabretooth","be","portrai","through","poor","cgi","amazingli","though","the","cat","look","much","realist","in","a","upclos","detail","shoot","rather","than","the","long","much","distant","shot","where","the","cgi","be","well","conceal","their","attack","be","recklessli","bloodi","and","distast","just","a","you","have","expect","thei","attack","rip","off","some","arm","and","leg","and","leav","veri","littl","behind","thi","be","part","of","the","reason","why","the","film","descend","into","poor","schlockbr","br","the","plot","and","charact","be","just","a","horrend","we","have","some","colleg","kid","who","come","to","the","island","and","thei","plan","a","scaveng","hunt","and","take","it","veri","veri","serious","even","so","much","a","to","trespass","on","privat","properti","tamper","with","secur","system","and","steal","why","be","thei","take","a","simpl","game","so","serious","do","i","miss","someth","be","there","monei","involv","or","be","thei","send","to","do","it","i","do","not","know","i","can","bare","follow","the","film","but","it","seem","to","me","like","thei","be","just","do","it","for","the","fun","of","do","it","even","so","thei","go","too","far","for","normalbr","br","attack","of","the","sabretooth","be","a","veri","poor","film","even","for","a","lowbudget","scifi","flick","it","be","a","veri","poor","and","cheap","exampl","it","will","bear","much","viewer","to","tear","mai","be","attract","for","some","and","will","make","you","chuckl","and","laugh","all","the","wai","through","and","keep","in","mind","thi","be","not","a","comedi","thi","be","a","cheap","horror","flick","so","it","not","suppos","to","be","comic"],"filtered":["liter","everi","aspect","thi","sciencefict","lowbudget","flick","fall","categori","classifi","predecessor","contemporari","follow","bad","special","effect","weak","storylin","ridicul","amount","blood","gore","annoi","pointless","charact","expect","attack","sabretooth","new","vacat","resort","proprietor","genet","engin","smilodon","cat","attract","cat","escap","begin","kill","peopl","gui","run","show","want","save","warn","unsuspect","visitor","band","visitor","employe","rebel","plan","kill","catsbr","br","special","effectswis","film","averag","achiev","give","budget","sabretooth","portrai","poor","cgi","amazingli","though","cat","look","much","realist","upclos","detail","shoot","rather","long","much","distant","shot","cgi","well","conceal","attack","recklessli","bloodi","distast","expect","thei","attack","rip","arm","leg","leav","veri","littl","behind","thi","part","reason","film","descend","poor","schlockbr","br","plot","charact","horrend","colleg","kid","come","island","thei","plan","scaveng","hunt","take","veri","veri","serious","even","much","trespass","privat","properti","tamper","secur","system","steal","thei","take","simpl","game","serious","miss","someth","monei","involv","thei","send","know","bare","follow","film","seem","like","thei","fun","even","thei","go","far","normalbr","br","attack","sabretooth","veri","poor","film","even","lowbudget","scifi","flick","veri","poor","cheap","exampl","bear","much","viewer","tear","mai","attract","make","chuckl","laugh","wai","keep","mind","thi","comedi","thi","cheap","horror","flick","suppos","comic"],"filtered2":["liter","everi","aspect","sciencefict","lowbudget","flick","fall","categori","classifi","predecessor","contemporari","follow","bad","special","effect","weak","storylin","ridicul","amount","blood","gore","annoi","pointless","charact","expect","attack","sabretooth","new","vacat","resort","proprietor","genet","engin","smilodon","cat","attract","cat","escap","begin","kill","peopl","gui","run","show","want","save","warn","unsuspect","visitor","band","visitor","employe","rebel","plan","kill","catsbr","special","effectswis","averag","achiev","give","budget","sabretooth","portrai","poor","cgi","amazingli","though","cat","look","realist","upclos","detail","shoot","rather","long","distant","shot","cgi","well","conceal","attack","recklessli","bloodi","distast","expect","attack","rip","arm","leg",

{"value":"I'm gettin' sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one-line synopsis then end up being equal to what you'd find in the bottom center of a compost heap.<br /><br />Who knows: \"Witchery\" may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios, even with a \"big name cast\" (like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink, nudge-nudge) and the effervescent likes of Hildegard Knef (I dunno, some woman...).<br /><br />But on film, it just falls apart faster than a papier-mache sculpture in a rainstorm. Seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the Eastern seaboard, and one of them (a woman, I'd guess) is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque, tortuous ways. <br /><br />Okay, right there you have a cross-section of plots from \"The Exorcist\", \"The Omen\", \"Ten Little Indians\" and a few other lesser movies in the satanic-worshippers-run-amok line. None of it is very entertaining and for the most part, you'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it's over.<br /><br />No, not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help matters much. They're just in it to pick up a paycheck and don't seem very intent on giving it their \"all\". <br /><br />From the looks of it, Hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him?) and Linda... well, who knows; a celebrity PETA benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is she's in to nowadays.<br /><br />And the torture scenes! Ecchhhh. You'll see people get their mouths sewn shut, dangled up inside roaring fireplaces, strung up in trees during a violent storm, vessels bursting out of their necks, etc, etc. Sheesh, and I thought \"Mark of the Devil\" was the most sadistic movie I'd seen....<br /><br />Don't bother.

{"value":"I just saw DreamGirls yesterday, and I was REALLY underimpressed. Despite all the Oscar buzz, this is nothing special. Anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics. Except for Eddie Murphy's great musical and dramatic performance, Dreamgirls is just a glorified TV movie with no style or flair. Just a bunch of amateurs singing AT each other!<br /><br />Now, the first half hour was good, but I was irritated at how Eddie Murphy's terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages. Those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film. And the \"rise to the top\" portion of the film was the only part of the film that had a consistent point of view or any momentum. The remaining hour and 45 minutes was a formless, rambling mess that was neither realistic nor fantastic enough to be interesting. It was also visually dull and included too many sound-alike tunes.<br /><br />Condon didn't try to turn any of the tunes into big show pieces as I'd expected they would. Each number in the 2nd half was just one closeup after another of people \"singing\" AT each other. And the way they shot Hudson's big \"love me\" number was criminal! Condon just shot her stomping around the stage--no drama at all! God it sucked!<br /><br />AND note to all involved--that \"sing-talking dialog\" stuff might work on stage, but it DOES NOT WORK IN MOVIES (see embarrassing failures of Evita and Phantom). All that \"I'll teeeell youuuu something Efff-ieeee!\" crap should have been left on the editing room floor. Those aren't \"songs.\"<br /><br />Again, the film--except for Eddie Murphy's amazing performance--was nothing more than a glorified TV movie. There must have been megabucks behind the PR work for this film! I wonder how much money was spent to give it that pre-release \"one to beat\" Oscar buzz? As a whole this film was, except for Eddie, NOWHERE NEAR an Oscar caliber movie! (except for Eddie) I'd rank it right up there with Grease 2.

{"value":"This is a well-worn story about a man who marries to escape the hangman's noose, then sets about \"taming\" his reluctant bride. It manages to be sexist and racist at exactly the same time. We never find out, for example, why a woman who won the respect of an Indian warrior is completely unable to fight back against her erstwhile husband. Or why the members of her team are so eager to get a \"real man\" in the saddle when she seems to have been taking care of things just fine on her own. This only made sense in fifties Hollywood.<br /><br />There's a really stupid scene where she horsewhips him and he actually catches the whip--the second time--then yanks her off her horse. Never mind that the first time probably would have lost him an eye, which would make it pretty hard to grab that whip! Then, he prevails in a fight against her Indian bodyguard where he spends the first two thirds of it getting beaten to a pulp. That's some second wind. Later, he successfully negotiates with some bloodthirsty Indians (as they all are in these flicks) after they reject her now she's his \"squaw\". Never mind that he has zero diplomatic skills and she's been negotiating with them for years. And the way he keeps rejecting her attempts to seduce him just to keep her keen and keep her from getting a hold on him--yeah, right. Like the women are just throwing themselves at him all the way down the trail.<br /><br />Finally, neither of the leads is convincing in their roles. Madison is just a jerk who gets unrealistically lucky. Fleming flips her hair and scowls a lot, but is totally unconvincing as a fiery tomboy. The only reason you'd root for her is because you want to see Madison get tied to a runaway horse and dragged over a cliff before the film's end. The way that Madison tames Fleming is so predictable and has so few obstacles that it will irritate the heck out of you if you see women as anything but blow-up dolls.

{"value":"I have come out of several years of lurking on these boards due to the sheer lack of intelligence that is communicated through the reviews that periodically appear on this film's IMDb space. I saw this movie courtesy of subway cinema's new york Asian film festival (which had an otherwise excellent selection of movies this year, see vital, snake of june, CHA NO AJI, Survive Style)and have regretted every day that a scene from that movie disengorges itself from the back of my mind, and becomes a vivid memory.<br /><br />I'm sure that you can read a laudatory summary of the film off of Subway Cinema, which is probably why I made the mistake of dragging my friend to the film. The description built up the kind of horror film that I had longed for for a while, one that relies on sheer terror rather than cheap scares. P was in fact different. It relied on cheap laughs.<br /><br />The incredibly annoying announcer described this movie as \"Lesbians team up to fight monsters.\" Completely untrue. There is a subplot built up in this film to make it seem like the relationship between the girl and Pookie is actually going somewhere. More lies. This film seems like a short made for \"Are you afraid of the dark?\" The story is ridiculous, and only succeeded in eliciting laughter and confusion from the audience after they finally rescinded their attempt to view this film with any semblance of seriousness and try to forget the $9 that they wasted at the door. I almost wish paul spurrier was in the audience so that I could laugh at him and ask him why he wasted 5 years in thailand to make a bad softcore horror-cum-porn that belongs on the spice channel, which only succeeded to get the actress excommunicated from her family, and caused a minor stir at the belgium film festival. The only stir that this caused was a gurgle in the lower intestine as it couldn't extract itself from the sh*te that it is. Anyway, I hope I can dissaude anyone from making the grave mistake of seeing this film, it was truly one of my top 3 worst movie experiences, knocking out soulplane for the number

{"value":"The rumor is true: girls like COYOTE UGLY more than guys. And the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. Jersey girl goes to New York to become a song writer. And after initial frustration of having no luck, overhears some girls partying about the $300 each they made last night. She gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise! The place is completely full of \"two year old toddlers\" bursting at the sight of babes dancing.<br /><br />The story is not bad and some characters are likeable, especially Cammie (the \"fashion coordinator\" part was cute) and the bouncer but let's face it, the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning. Violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie. And check out Violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer!<br /><br />For the first time I could think of, how could the production be so terrible? For a brief moment with this movie, Hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying, \"You were warned!\" Instead, it seems COYOTE UGLY has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world. Advertising babes in a bar, but showing a paper thin \"pursue your dream\" story disappointed every male teen you targeted!<br /><br />And finally, the music. There was absolutely no break of music I found in this movie, especially when it was needed (the hospital scene). Every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened. But the climax was an ultimate laugher: an '80s like song you would expect Cyndi Lauper to jump on the stage and jam with Violet. Heck, I personally thought Bon Jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too!<br /><br />Other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing (especially the wet scene), and a couple cute cliches, COYOTE UGLY is something to be purely embarrassed about.

{"value":"Please Don't hate me but i have to be honest, watching this movie, i had a lot of fun,,<br /><br />It's a Movie with a Stupid Cast and Stupid Songs!!!<br /><br />Unnecessary songs!!! Mehbooba... A Total Insult to the Original One Holi.... well.. it was OK! due to the Tradition Every Movie got to have one!! Chad Raha hai Nasha Whatever... Very UNNEEDED stupid Song jee Le... Sounded like a Playboy Song Stupid Song...<br /><br />Other than Songs. The Movie was OK This was Ram Gopal Verma's Own Adaptation... If you think like that you will like this movie<br /><br />Well this movie only Depends on the Viewer and on his judgement whether he/she thinks this movie is total Copy He/She would want to hit her Head on the Cinema Seat OR if he/She Thinks of the Directors Own Look he/she would be relaxed and take a look at this movie<br /><br />Anyways I looked at both ways i would Congratulate and Abuse Ram Gopal for this Disaster that he made...<br /><br />Well Some other Things that bothered that The CAST was Incredibly Bad<br /><br />Amitabh Bachchan As Babban/Gabbar (Amitabh in his own Movie Remake

{"value":"Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals, this movie is not for everyone.<br /><br />The story is very similar to other movies, in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age, and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family. She does that by choosing some kind of sport, and with the help of a local boy, that for some reason falls in love with her, she confronts her problems and wins.<br /><br />In Girlfight it's boxing, in Bend it like Beckham it's soccer, and now it's Kung Fu.<br /><br />But Fighter is much inferior product than these two, it was simply embarrassing to watch it. Semra Turan, the \"actress\" that playing the role of a teenage girl, maybe can do a lot of things, but one thing she can't do is to act. Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy, the dramatic situations, in which she tries to show some emotions, are dreadful, her body and facial language are of amateur actress, badly instructed by the director. The rest of the cast is a little better, but they just cannot save this cliché movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot. Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer.<br /><br />Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this, it's just so boring. The slow motion was really unnecessary, the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration, and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions, not actually fighting. Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys, and knocks them off their feet. <br /><br />The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's European. It's very easy to publicize this movie - A first martial arts film from Denmark, but don't be fooled, it's not. It's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems, which are, by the way, not really convincing.<br /><br />Bad movie with embarrassing lines, acting and story.","finished_norm":["despit","posit","review","and","screen","at","the","intern","festiv","thi","movi","be","not","for","everyonebr","br","the","stori","be","veri","similar","to","other","movi","in","which","a","teenag","girl","from","the","famili","of","immigr","ne","to","overcom","mani","common","person","problem","of","her","ag","and","conjur","to","struggl","against","the","pressur","of","ethnic","tradit","in","her","famili","she","doe","that","by","choos","some","kind","of","sport","and","with","the","help","of","a","local","boi","that","for","some","reason","fall","in","love","with","her","she","confront","her","problem","and","winsbr","br","in","girlfight","it","box","in","bend","it","like","beckham","it","soccer","and","now","it","kung","fubr","br","but","fighter","be","much","inferior","product","than","thi","two","it","be","simpli","embarrass","to","watch","it","semra","turan","the","actress","that","plai","the","role","of","a","teenag","girl","mayb","can","do","a","lot","of","thing","but","on","thing","she","ca","not","do","be","to","act","her","presenc","on","the","screen","be","anem","and","clumsi","the","dramat","situat","in","which","she","try","to","show","some","emot","be","dread","her","bodi","and","facial","languag","be","of","amateur","actress","badli","instruct","by","the","director","the","rest","of","the","cast","be","a","littl","well","but","thei","just","cannot","save","thi","cliché","movi","with","stereotyp","charact","and","shallow","plot","besid","a","few","rel","good","moment","thi","movi","have","noth","new","or","interest","to","offerbr","br","even","the","kung","fu","fight","be","not","a","reason","to","watch","thi","it","just","so","bore","the","slow","motion","be","realli","unnecessari","the","choreographi","be","basic","and","lack","the","inspir","and","much","of","the","kung","fu","scene","be","just","train","or","stand","in","all","kind","of","kung","fu","posit","not","actual","fight","not","to","mention","how","ridicul","it","look","when","a","small","and","skinni","girl","fight","big","and","muscular","boi","and","knock","them","off","their","foot","br","br","the","onli","reason","thi","movi","have","be","notic","at","all","be","becaus","it","european","it","veri","easi","to","public","thi","movi","a","martial","art","film","from","denmark","but","do","not","be","fool","it","not","it","just","a","drama","about","stupid","teenag","girl","and","her","problem","which","be","by","the","wai","not","realli","convincingbr","br","bad","movi","with","embarrass","line","act","and","stori"],"filtered":["despit","posit","review","screen","intern","festiv","thi","movi","everyonebr","br","stori","veri","similar","movi","teenag","girl","famili","immigr","ne","overcom","mani","common","person","problem","ag","conjur","struggl","pressur","ethnic","tradit","famili","doe","choos","kind","sport","help","local","boi","reason","fall","love","confront","problem","winsbr","br","girlfight","box","bend","like","beckham","soccer","kung","fubr","br","fighter","much","inferior","product","thi","two","simpli","embarrass","watch","semra","turan","actress","plai","role","teenag","girl","mayb","lot","thing","thing","ca","act","presenc","screen","anem","clumsi","dramat","situat","try","show","emot","dread","bodi","facial","languag","amateur","actress","badli","instruct","director","rest","cast","littl","well","thei","save","thi","cliché","movi","stereotyp","charact","shallow","plot","besid","rel","good","moment","thi","movi","noth","new","interest","offerbr","br","even","kung","fu","fight","reason","watch","thi","bore","slow","motion","realli","unnecessari","choreographi","basic","lack","inspir","much","kung","fu","scene","train","stand","kind","kung","fu","posit","actual","fight","mention","ridicul","look","small","skinni","girl","fight","big","muscular","boi","knock","foot","br","br","onli","reason","thi","movi","notic","becaus","european","veri","easi","public","thi","movi","martial","art","film","denmark","fool","drama","stupid","teenag","girl","problem","wai","realli","convincingbr","br","bad","movi","embarrass","line","act","stori"],"filtered2":["despit","posit","review","screen","intern","festiv","everyonebr","stori","veri","similar","teenag","girl","famili","immigr","ne","overcom","mani","common","person","problem","ag","conjur","struggl","pressur","ethnic","tradit","famili","doe","choos","kind","sport","help","local","boi","reason","fall","love","confront","problem","winsbr","girlfight","box","bend","like","beckham","soccer","kung","fubr","fighter","inferior","product","two","simpli","embarrass","watch","semra","turan","actress","plai","role","teenag","girl","mayb","lot","thing","thing","ca","act","presenc","screen","anem","clumsi","dramat","situat","try","show","emot","dread","bodi","facial","languag","amateur","actress","badli","instruct","director","rest","cast","littl","well","save","cliché","stereotyp","charact","shallow","plot","besid","rel","good","moment","noth","new","interest","

{"value":"First of all let me say the first 20 minutes are great, the monster looks superb and the CGI is reasonably done. It's a shame then that the rest of the movie is such a disappointment, <br /><br />******** SPOILERS BELOW ******** <br /><br />From the opening scene we can see this movie is anti-American, normally this sort of stereotyping wouldn't bother me (we Brits get enough from Hollywood) but here it's not subtle about making the Americans brain-dead morons. It goes past the point of realism and your left wondering if a Yank has raped the directors mother.<br /><br />The grieving scene was really poor and the part of the movie where it starts going downhill.<br /><br />Here we are introduced to the Olympic medallist Auntie and drunk Uncle who walk into the memorial and start blaming the father for his daughters death, then hitting him before they all start rolling around on the floor crying. Hardly realistic bonding at a time of crisis!<br /><br />The whole virus sideline is ridiculous. If the Americans know there isn't a virus, why are they wasting time, money and resources investigating? The US government agent orders the brain drilling of an innocent Korean for nothing, making the Americans look evil (or stupid), it wasn't helped by the fact this guy was cross-eyed for comical effect.<br /><br />The movie is about hunting the monster. US and Korean special forces are assigned to finding the creature although through-out the movie they are invisible. The only people hunting the monster, in the whole of Korea, is the main family and some random tramp who appears at the end to save the day! Naturally a few US/Korean agents try to stop them along the way.<br /><br />The sister was only included in the movie so she could make the vital shot at the end.

{"value":"Carnosaur 3 is bad... awfully bad. Bad to the point where it is funny. How matter how much I try to convince myself, I just can't believe anyone in this world could find this entertaining for serious reasons. I mean, come on, even the cover is bad! OK, the special effects are absolutely ridiculous. Those \"Carnosaurs\" are really ridiculous. A scientist tells the soldiers that they move incredibly fast, yet when you see them run, they run at the speed of... an actor in a rubber suit trying to run as much as he can. And the explosions are funny(there is no other word to describe it). At the beginning, a bullet hits a Jeep AFTER a guys says \"What was that?\"... And the other explosions are also laughable. But the worst thing is the screenplay and the so-called story. You don't expect a good story(or, I don't think anyone renting this movie expects a good movie) but at least the story has to try to make sense. I mean, how hard is it to make a story about dinosaurs killing people at least coherent. Incredibly hard if you look at this. Oh, and if you think that it's easy to makes believable commandos as your characters, tell it to the writers of this awful, awful piece of crap. I mean, what sick human being would make cheap jokes after one of his buddies is dead? And they do lots of it. And if you think that a movie about dinosaurs killing soldiers can only be at least action-packed, WAKE UP!!! This movie is incredibly dull. The carnosaurs(who invented this lame name anyway?) attack(in boring action sequences where you don't see much happening). The soldiers think of how to beat them(in incredibly funny scenes where they try real hard to be serious but can't seem to convince even just one second). So, then, they attack the carnosaurs, but their idea doesn't work(another laughable action sequence). Back to planning(with a few lame jokes thrown in) in another ridiculous scene. And this goes on, and on, and on. And let's not forget the acting which is about as convincing as the special effects... and the story...

{"value":"This wasn't all that great. Not terrible or hateful or anything, just forgettable.<br /><br />It had a sort of, um, hesitant, diluted air, like it never properly knew whether it wanted to go for laughs or for sweetness or for satire. So we were left with weak mix of the three. The actors seemed kinda lost.<br /><br />Also, the ideas were really tired and recycled, almost zombified themselves. How many more times do we have to be told the 50's in the States were infected with a banal sense of conformity? And that this was perpetuated by aggressive consumerism? And that emotional repression in men is a baaaaad thing? Old hat.<br /><br />Its biggest crime in my eyes though was just how detached from reality it was. I know it was a comedy and all, but - especially in a full movie where you must keep the interest of an audience for a prolonged period - you still need some sort of emotional anchor, some relatable guide through the story, to make it engaging. For the 'hero' kid to watch an old woman, two fellow school pupils and ultimately his father die painfully at the hands of zombies or whatever and for him to greet it all with a cheery smile and a shrug of the shoulders, then I just struggle to deal with that in any sort of positive way. The mum was the same. If you make your two main characters so inhuman on that level, then you risk losing me and that's what happened.<br /><br />Biggest positive I can offer is that I love the look of that sort of apple pie suburbia and this captured it well enough, it was a handsome film, especially some of those wide angled shots of the street and inside the Robinsons' house. Also, the opening newsreel was cute, in a been-done-before-but-still-funny sort of way.<br /><br />And I thought Billy Connolly was OK and that comes from someone who isn't a big fan of Billy Connolly: Movie Star. I just had this fear he was going to be hamming it up and trying to steal every scene, but he played it pretty low-key for him and probably came out the most sympathetic character in the whole film.<br /><br />All in all, not great

{"value":"Oh, man, how low serials had fallen as by 1952! This dull thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed Annie Wilkes (from Misery). Not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that weren't there in the previous chapter (and that COULDN'T possibly be there - tell me that when the baddies blow up the plain in episode 7 to 8 they wouldn't see the characters jump), but I think this serial has the World's Record of Stock Footage. I mean, most of it is stock footage! And not just from another serials (apparently all the flying sequences come from King of the Rocket Men, and the cool \"molten rocks\" scenes of episode 2 to 3 is from Adventures of Captain Marvel), but from itself! The whole \"trip to the Moon\" sequence (which is probably the shortest ever, it's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave Earth's atmosphere) from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8! And episode 10 is ALL scenes from previous episodes! (Ever wondered why MST3K never did episodes 10, 11 and 12? Well, they had to stop after 9 so they didn't have to do the whole thing again!).<br /><br />Don't get me started on the science factor. Prepare to see the sunniest Moon ever! And Moon men that can not breathe on their own world? What were they smoking? <br /><br />And if this is not enough, it's too talky and the stunts (usually the best thing in serials) are few and far. Visually-wise, am I the only one who thinks that Commando Cody's bullet-shaped (or is it lemon-shaped) helmet is totally ridiculous-looking? The Rocketeer's was way cooler, no matter how bad that movie was (and man, was it awful). The tank-like vehicle isn't much better, it looks like a bunch of kids made it for Halloween. The only positive thing I can think of about it is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular hunk (hey, everybody has the right to be an hero!), but then he's so unappealing...<br /><br />Not even worth watching for nostalgia's sake. See Captain Marvel instead. 2/10.<br /><br />(BTW, check out the Memorable Quotes section for a real Women's Lib pearl).","finished_norm":["oh","man","how","low","serial","have","fall","a","by","thi","dull","thing","be","precis","the","kind","of","serial","that","annoi","anni","wilk","from","miseri","not","onli","the","hero","escap","the","trap","by","add","scene","that","be","not","there","in","the","previou","chapter","and","that","couldn","t","possibli","be","there","tell","me","that","when","the","baddi","blow","up","the","plain","in","episod","to","thei","would","not","see","the","charact","jump","but","i","think","thi","serial","have","the","world","record","of","stock","footag","i","mean","much","of","it","be","stock","footag","and","not","just","from","anoth","serial","appar","all","the","fly","sequenc","come","from","king","of","the","rocket","man","and","the","cool","melt","rock","scene","of","episod","to","be","from","adventur","of","captain","marvel","but","from","itself","the","whole","trip","to","the","moon","sequenc","which","be","probabl","the","short","ever","it","second","long","and","the","charact","never","seem","to","leav","earth","atmospher","from","episod","be","repeat","in","episod","and","episod","be","all","scene","from","previou","episod","ever","wonder","why","mstk","never","do","episod","and","good","thei","have","to","stop","after","so","thei","do","not","have","to","do","the","whole","thing","againbr","br","do","not","get","me","start","on","the","scienc","factor","prepar","to","see","the","sunni","moon","ever","and","moon","man","that","can","not","breath","on","their","own","world","what","be","thei","smoke","br","br","and","if","thi","be","not","enough","it","too","talki","and","the","stunt","usual","the","well","thing","in","serial","be","few","and","far","visuallywis","be","i","the","onli","on","who","think","that","commando","codi","bulletshap","or","be","it","lemonshap","helmet","be","total","ridiculouslook","the","rocket","be","wai","cool","no","matt","how","bad","that","movi","be","and","man","be","it","aw","the","tanklik","vehicl","be","not","much","well","it","look","like","a","bunch","of","kid","make","it","for","halloween","the","onli","posit","thing","i","can","think","of","about","it","be","that","the","actor","who","plai","the","hero","be","home","instead","of","the","usual","muscular","hunk","hei","everybodi","have","the","right","to","be","a","hero","but","then","he","so","unappealingbr","br","not","even","worth","watch","for","nostalgia","sake","see","captain","marvel","instead","br","br","btw","check","out","the","memor","quot","section","for","a","real","woman","lib","pearl"],"filtered":["oh","man","low","serial","fall","thi","dull","thing","precis","kind","serial","annoi","anni","wilk","miseri","onli","hero","escap","trap","add","scene","previou","chapter","couldn","possibli","tell","baddi","blow","plain","episod","thei","see","charact","jump","think","thi","serial","world","record","stock","footag","mean","much","stock","footag","anoth","serial","appar","fly","sequenc","come","king","rocket","man","cool","melt","rock","scene","episod","adventur","captain","marvel","whole","trip","moon","sequenc","probabl","short","ever","second","long","charact","never","seem","leav","earth","atmospher","episod","repeat","episod","episod","scene","previou","episod","ever","wonder","mstk","never","episod","good","thei","stop","thei","whole","thing","againbr","br","get","start","scienc","factor","prepar","see","sunni","moon","ever","moon","man","breath","world","thei","smoke","br","br","thi","enough","talki","stunt","usual","well","thing","serial","far","visuallywis","onli","think","commando","codi","bulletshap","lemonshap","helmet","total","ridiculouslook","rocket","wai","cool","matt","bad","movi","man","aw","tanklik","vehicl","much","well","look","like","bunch","kid","make","halloween","onli","posit","thing","think","actor","plai","hero","home","instead","usual","muscular","hunk","hei","everybodi","right","hero","unappealingbr","br","even","worth","watch","nostalgia","sake","see","captain","marvel","instead","br","br","btw","check","memor","quot","section","real","woman","lib","pearl"],"filtered2":["oh","man","low","serial","fall","dull","thing","precis","kind","serial","annoi","anni","wilk","miseri","onli","hero","escap","trap","add","scene","previou","chapter","couldn","possibli","tell","baddi","blow","plain","see","charact","jump","think","serial","world","record","stock","footag","mean","stock","footag","anoth","serial","appar","fly","sequenc","come","king","rocket","man","cool","melt","rock","scene","adventur","captain","marvel","whole","trip","moon","sequenc","probabl","short","ever","second","long","charact","never","seem","leav","earth","atmospher","repeat","scene","previou","ever","wonder","mstk","never","good","stop","whole","thing","againbr","get","start","scienc","factor","prepar","see","sunni","moon","ever","moon","man","breath","world","smoke","enough","talki","stunt","usual","well","thing","serial","far","visuallywis","onli","think","commando","codi","bulletshap","le

{"value":"It's easy to see how this below-average screenplay got by in the early sales-pitch meetings at Regency Films (and later with Fox): cross the superhero genre with a comedic take on \"Fatal Attraction\"...voilà! I don't know how on earth a talented director like Ivan Reitman got involved, unless the pay was just too tempting. A dateless employee at an architectural design firm in N.Y.C. meets a girl on the subway and asks her out; despite the fact she's distracted and unpleasant, he eventually gets her into bed--only to find out later she's the Big Apple's resident superhero, G-Girl. This distaff Superman, with powers bestowed upon her by a fallen meteorite, isn't a fantasy heroine, however...screenwriter Don Payne has conceived her as a needy, possessive, vindictive bitch (he telegraphs this to us from miles away, though Uma Thurman still plays the role for sassy laughs). This is the kind of worthless movie that can't let an insult slip by. Our introduction to leading man Luke Wilson, talking with Rainn Wilson on the train, is accompanied by a sour dig at gays (it prods at us to be assured these two buddies are strictly ladies' men). After being approached by G-Girl's nemesis, who wants to zap her powers, Wilson is told this will make her just an ordinary woman scorned...and isn't that better after all? Thurman's early performances in films like \"Henry & June\" and \"Jennifer 8\" showcased an intelligent woman with angular grace and hypnotic poise; her films with Quentin Tarantino helped expose her sinewy hardness and intensity, but that came at a price (the actress has seemingly lost her graceful touch). The picture is exceedingly well-produced and shot, with expensive-seeming special effects, yet nobody bothered to find the humor in this scenario. It's pushy, leering, ugly, and badly-cast. Bloated, frozen-faced Wilson can't tell any of his co-workers that he's dating G-Girl because she made him swear he'd rather have a chainsaw stuck up his rectum. I wonder if writer Payne actually thought that was hilarious...or, indeed, if anyone involved did? * from

{"value":"The Shirley Jackson novel 'The Haunting of Hill House' is an atmospheric tale of terror, which conveys supernatural phenomena in an old mansion. The atmosphere is well set out, and the chills are staged well. A haunting masterpiece.<br /><br />The 1963 chiller 'The Haunting' stays closely to the book, but also adds its own details to the plot. Fortunately, these are very few, and so the terror of the book and the chills are executed even better on the screen. The black and white photography only adds to the creepiness of the movie. Excellent! <br /><br />And then, Jan de Bont made this. In 1999, the remake of The Haunting hit the cinemas - if you could call this a remake. Why they had to make a remake of the 1963 movie is a mystery in itself, but for the moment, lets look at the film itself.<br /><br />It starts off averagely, as most horror movies do. The set used for Hill House is beautiful, and oddly mysterious, and for a few minutes, it seems as if the film is actually going to be quite a fair re-telling. And then, the first scare comes: a loose harpsichord wire slashes a woman's face (Dr. Marrow's assistant). This is hilarious, and truth be told, it nearly had me in tears.<br /><br />From then on, the film just spirals downwards. The acting seems to become somewhat wooden as the film goes on, with Owen Wilson's character being particularly irritating (so it's such a relief when he's decapitated by the flue).<br /><br />The special effects practically make this movie,, which is a shame, because most of them are incredibly cheesy and look very dated. Examples of these are many, so I won't bother listing them.<br /><br />So, all in all, I, along with hundreds of others, strongly recommend that you watch the original chiller, or, as an alternative, buy the novel by Shirley Jackson. But please, stay away from this. And, if you do decide to watch this, watch it on the TV (as a lot of the channels love to screen this film, and not the original) or rent it cheap, but please don't buy it, whatever you do. Don't waste your money!<br /><br />Final rating:

{"value":"Ah, the spirit of '68. The streets of Paris were running wild with rebellion, the hippies were high on the spirit of love. How was Britain marking this age of radicalism and revolution? Erm, by the looks of it, dear Old Blighty was focusing on making films about boys in boarding schools. If... contains the evil establishment. It contains the uprising of the oppressed. What it lacks in contrast to the Parisien passion and the hippy headtripping is any sense of excitement, except in its all-out ammo-and-artillery fire ending.<br /><br />Lindsay Anderson's If... stars the ever-marvellous Malcolm McDowell as one of three private school pupils who decorate their dorm with photos of Lenin and other left-wing radicals. It's clearly an anti-establishment movie in its depiction of the evil upper-class oiks who rule the roost and the antiquated autocratic practices of the pish-posh public school standard. What makes If... unusual though is that for all its radical sympathies, it doesn't explicitly give us any sense of great tension between human decency and the despotic school system, instead it just kind of floats: lacking in plot and lacking in personality.<br /><br />Surrealist bits fade in and out occasionally and the film slips from black-and-white to colour again (is it due to the low budget or is it an arty expression?), but there is little of interest to speak of. All we get is the poignant denouement where the young rebels reach for their rifles and shoot down the shady overlords of the establishment. Hooray! A revolution! At last something that demands a second thought unlike the rest of this dull exercise in boarding school daydreaming.<br /><br />If... could have been a powerful political statement, but as it is it drifts and only gathers any sense of direct interest at the end. Instead of being a testament to the dissident zeitgeist of the late-Sixties, it only succeeds in being a dazed document of upper-class British education. Anarchy? Apathy more like, the only man many viewers will want to stick it to after watching If... will be Lindsay

{"value":"Over the last 20 years the majority of British films are about how horribly poverty stricken the UK is and how our youth doesn't stand a chance of a good life whilst they live on the mean streets of British cities. The British film industry is obsessed with the idea of 'broken Britain'. Trainspotting, This is England, Kidulthood, Football Factory, Kes and From London to Brighton.<br /><br />Bullet Boy is just another British movie added to that list. The main character expresses a desire to go straight yet he still insists on hanging around with dead beats who carry guns and fight with gang members over nothing. I was never convinced that he did want to go straight as there was nothing stopping him pursuing an education or a trade. In fact it would have been a breath of fresh air if he had of gone straight and we had a character who turned his life around. Instead he spends his time helping his friend trying to commit murder. I felt no sympathy when he is predictably shot by another teen at the end of the film, which is sad because at the beginning of the film I really liked the entire family and their desire for success. I believe the makers missed a great chance to show the world that success belongs to those who are willing to really strive for it (like the Pursuit of Happiness). <br /><br />I know the purpose of this film was to try and paint a realistic picture of what life is like for black teens living in working class areas of Britain but don't we already have enough films in the UK with that very same plot? Isn't it time these talented producers and writers give Britains youth something to aspire to and show them a better life is just around the corner?<br /><br />I applaud the makers of Bullet Boy for not loading the film full of mindless violence in order to try and get success through shock factors (like Kidulthood, Football Factory) but at the same time this movie offers nothing new to a long list of British films that are effectively dull and depressing to watch. There is no happy ending to this movie or any of the others I have mentioned.","finished_norm":["over","the","last","year","the","major","of","british","film","be","about","how","horribli","poverti","strike","the","uk","be","and","how","our","youth","doe","not","stand","a","chanc","of","a","good","life","whilst","thei","live","on","the","mean","street","of","british","citi","the","british","film","industri","be","obsess","with","the","idea","of","break","britain","trainspot","thi","be","england","kidulthood","footbal","factori","ke","and","from","london","to","brightonbr","br","bullet","boi","be","just","anoth","british","movi","add","to","that","list","the","main","charact","express","a","desir","to","go","straight","yet","he","still","insist","on","hang","around","with","dead","beat","who","carri","gun","and","fight","with","gang","member","over","noth","i","be","never","convinc","that","he","do","want","to","go","straight","a","there","be","noth","stop","him","pursu","a","educ","or","a","trade","in","fact","it","would","have","be","a","breath","of","fresh","air","if","he","have","of","go","straight","and","we","have","a","charact","who","turn","hi","life","around","instead","he","spend","hi","time","help","hi","friend","try","to","commit","murder","i","feel","no","sympathi","when","he","be","predict","shoot","by","anoth","teen","at","the","end","of","the","film","which","be","sad","becaus","at","the","begin","of","the","film","i","realli","like","the","entir","famili","and","their","desir","for","success","i","believ","the","maker","miss","a","great","chanc","to","show","the","world","that","success","belong","to","that","who","be","will","to","realli","strive","for","it","like","the","pursuit","of","happi","br","br","i","know","the","purpos","of","thi","film","be","to","try","and","paint","a","realist","pictur","of","what","life","be","like","for","black","teen","live","in","work","class","area","of","britain","but","do","not","we","alreadi","have","enough","film","in","the","uk","with","that","veri","same","plot","be","not","it","time","thi","talent","produc","and","writer","give","britain","youth","someth","to","aspir","to","and","show","them","a","well","life","be","just","around","the","cornerbr","br","i","applaud","the","maker","of","bullet","boi","for","not","load","the","film","full","of","mindless","violenc","in","order","to","try","and","get","success","through","shock","factor","like","kidulthood","footbal","factori","but","at","the","same","time","thi","movi","offer","noth","new","to","a","long","list","of","british","film","that","be","effect","dull","and","depress","to","watch","there","be","no","happi","end","to","thi","movi","or","ani","of","the","other","i","have","mention"],"filtered":["last","year","major","british","film","horribli","poverti","strike","uk","youth","doe","stand","chanc","good","life","whilst","thei","live","mean","street","british","citi","british","film","industri","obsess","idea","break","britain","trainspot","thi","england","kidulthood","footbal","factori","ke","london","brightonbr","br","bullet","boi","anoth","british","movi","add","list","main","charact","express","desir","go","straight","yet","still","insist","hang","around","dead","beat","carri","gun","fight","gang","member","noth","never","convinc","want","go","straight","noth","stop","pursu","educ","trade","fact","breath","fresh","air","go","straight","charact","turn","hi","life","around","instead","spend","hi","time","help","hi","friend","try","commit","murder","feel","sympathi","predict","shoot","anoth","teen","end","film","sad","becaus","begin","film","realli","like","entir","famili","desir","success","believ","maker","miss","great","chanc","show","world","success","belong","realli","strive","like","pursuit","happi","br","br","know","purpos","thi","film","try","paint","realist","pictur","life","like","black","teen","live","work","class","area","britain","alreadi","enough","film","uk","veri","plot","time","thi","talent","produc","writer","give","britain","youth","someth","aspir","show","well","life","around","cornerbr","br","applaud","maker","bullet","boi","load","film","full","mindless","violenc","order","try","get","success","shock","factor","like","kidulthood","footbal","factori","time","thi","movi","offer","noth","new","long","list","british","film","effect","dull","depress","watch","happi","end","thi","movi","ani","mention"],"filtered2":["last","year","major","british","horribli","poverti","strike","uk","youth","doe","stand","chanc","good","life","whilst","live","mean","street","british","citi","british","industri","obsess","idea","break","britain","trainspot","england","kidulthood","footbal","factori","ke","london","brightonbr","bullet","boi","anoth","british","add","list","main","charact","express","desir","go","straight","yet","still","insist","hang","around","dead","beat","carri","gun","fight","gang","member","noth","never","convinc","want","go","straight","noth","stop","pursu","educ","trade","fact","breath","fresh","air","go","straight","charact","turn","life","ar

{"value":"Casting bone to pick: David Jannsen was 38 playing the father of Robert Drivas, who was then, 31 (yeah, I realize he's supposed to be just out of college, but clues in the script have him being a loafer and so he's probably 24-25 in the script--- that still puts Jannsen in parenting classes in Junior High). I assume the AMA wrote medical miracle up in their 1938 Year in Medicine. This movie hasn't aged very well at all and now it's main appeal is just to see a snap shot of Sin City, circa 1969 and all the incessant smoking, the weird hair (Drivas has an atomic comb over that makes him resemble a well-groomed hip Cousin It) and trendy fashions that went along with it. If anyone remembers, LV wasn't exactly London... the city coddled the mob and codger gamblers in those days. Drivas comes off as sexually ambiguous; his dad thinks he might be gay (in a sad irony, Drivas himself died of AIDS at 47) and the soapy conflict is from the generation gap issue (ahem, as if one may call 7 years a gap). Sonny boy wants to be his own man and dad wants to pull him into the casino (Caesar's Palace!), and plies him with girls (including the horny-for-money Edy Williams). Interestingly enough, the son doesn't seem to mind being thought of as gay--- unusual for the time and a cute Brenda Vaccarro is nearby to swoon platonically over him. What nudity there is is awfully lame--- just what was needed to pull the audience in for an 'R' rating in the early days of the MPAA rating system (which then was G-M-R[16]- and X). The editing is HORRIBLE and there's stupid-silly overdubs by The Committee (a late 60's neo-avante-garde comedy troupe that mercifully faded off the map within a couple of years). Don Rickles is on board as a blackjack dealer... seemingly preparing him for a role as a floor manager in the much better CASINO two decades later. Not to give anything away, but they would've dealt with Mr. Rickles' character with power tools and a hole in the desert back then. A curiosity at best, far from Joshua Logan's usual caliber of work.

{"value":"This movie tries hard, but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s TV series, that I am sure people do remember with fondness. Although I am 17, I watched some of the series on YouTube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun. Sadly, this movie does little justice to the series.<br /><br />The special effects are rather substandard, and this wasn't helped by the flat camera-work. The script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour. Other films with under-par scripting are Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat, Thomas and the Magic Railroad and Addams Family Reunion.<br /><br />Now I will say I liked the idea of the story, but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early, and I am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy. And I was annoyed by the talking suit, despite spirited voice work from Wayne Knight.<br /><br />But the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of Christopher Lloyd, Jeff Daniels and Daryl Hannah, all very talented actors. Jeff Daniels has pulled off some good performances before, but he didn't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing, and Elizabeth Hurley's character sadly came across as useless. Daryl Hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored, and I liked the idea of her being the love interest, but sadly you see very little of her,(not to mention the Monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them) likewise with Wallace Shawn as some kind of government operative. Christopher Lloyd acquits himself better, and as an actor I like Lloyd a lot(he was in two of my favourite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I am fond of Back To The Future) but he was given little to work with, and had a tendency to overact quite wildly.<br /><br />Overall, as much I wanted to like this movie, I was left unimpressed. Instead of being fun, it came across as pointless, and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted with poor execution. 1/10 Bethany

story to make you laugh and the trick works at times thanks to the boredom set by most of other stories<br /><br />We have John- Vidya story a good story in all respects<br /><br />But then by the time all stories come in bits n pieces the viewer gets bored and sleepy The climax isn't appealing though especially The climax of Salman- Priyanka story Nikhil Advani's handling is alright at places, some stories are well handled but weak at places Music(SEL)is good, but too many songs Cinematography is nice, every story is given a different look, texture and it works<br /><br />Actors Govinda rocks, after a dismissal comeback with BB he actually makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and weight Anil Kapoor acts his part well, though he looks out of shape and tired John excels in his part, Akshaye Khanna overacts for a change<br /><br />Sohail Khan is too over- the - top and Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is dismissal<br /><br />Priyanka and Salman deserve an award for this film you are shocked?<br /><br />Salman Khan doesn't act only, just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god Priyanka overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her, she does get better towards the end Vidya Balan is good, Juhi Chawla is okay Shannon is

{"value":"I might not have been the biggest Blair Witch fan but nonetheless appreciated that effort, so I was looking forward to Altered, especially after reading the superlatives thrown around in various IMDb comments. \"Unique\", \"intelligent\", \"A future cult classic\" and so on... you gotta wonder where people come up with that stuff to describe such a poor effort.<br /><br />Because alas, Altered is a poor, weak movie that fails to engage in any and every respect. The silliness is not funny. The horror and gore is not scary. And whatever \"thinking\" aspect some poor fellows saw in this movie were due to severe delusions because there's certainly nothing profound or smart about this mess.<br /><br />OK, so we know nothing stands out. Is it at least bearable? Is the experience worthwhile in any way? Unfortunately, no. For starters, get very poor acting. It's not a stretch to say most B-movies these days feature better acting. The plot? Boring and messy. Dialogs? Many amateurs actually do better.<br /><br />It's really the direction that puzzles. I did not expect major improvements over Blair Witch but at least small steps forward. Instead, our director seems to have worsen over time, completely oblivious to previous experiences.<br /><br />If there is a major flaw in Altered, it's the main set. A major part of the plot takes place in a single location, where the main characters are confined but Sánchez has failed to give the place any personality whatsoever. Considering that in Blair Witch, the forest plays a major part and is as much a character (an antagonist, if you will) as the three students, you would think the director would realize the same thing was needed here. But no... this place has no personality whatsoever thanks to sloppy direction and no attention to details.<br /><br />There's nothing salvageable here. Die hard fans of \"Blair Witch\" are better off following Daniel Myrick. Although his output is far from being golden, it shows better structure than Sánchez and some lessons from Blair Witch are applied (unfortunately, in weak stories but still).","finished_norm":["i","mai","not","have","be","the","big","blair","witch","fan","but","nonetheless","appreci","that","effort","so","i","be","look","forward","to","alter","especi","after","read","the","superl","throw","around","in","variou","imdb","comment","uniqu","intellig","a","futur","cult","classic","and","so","on","you","gotta","wonder","where","peopl","come","up","with","that","stuff","to","describ","such","a","poor","effortbr","br","becaus","ala","alter","be","a","poor","weak","movi","that","fail","to","engag","in","ani","and","everi","respect","the","silli","be","not","funni","the","horror","and","gore","be","not","scari","and","whatev","think","aspect","some","poor","fellow","see","in","thi","movi","be","due","to","sever","delus","becaus","there","certainli","noth","profound","or","smart","about","thi","messbr","br","okai","so","we","know","noth","stand","out","be","it","at","littl","bearabl","be","the","experi","worthwhil","in","ani","wai","unfortun","no","for","starter","get","veri","poor","act","it","not","a","stretch","to","sai","much","bmovi","thi","dai","featur","well","act","the","plot","bore","and","messi","dialog","mani","amateur","actual","do","betterbr","br","it","realli","the","direct","that","puzzl","i","do","not","expect","major","improv","over","blair","witch","but","at","littl","small","step","forward","instead","our","director","seem","to","have","worsen","over","time","complet","oblivi","to","previou","experiencesbr","br","if","there","be","a","major","flaw","in","alter","it","the","main","set","a","major","part","of","the","plot","take","place","in","a","singl","locat","where","the","main","charact","be","confin","but","sánchez","have","fail","to","give","the","place","ani","person","whatsoev","consid","that","in","blair","witch","the","forest","plai","a","major","part","and","be","a","much","a","charact","a","antagonist","if","you","will","a","the","three","student","you","would","think","the","director","would","realiz","the","same","thing","be","ne","here","but","no","thi","place","have","no","person","whatsoev","thank","to","sloppi","direct","and","no","attent","to","detailsbr","br","there","noth","salvag","here","die","hard","fan","of","blair","witch","be","well","off","follow","daniel","myrick","although","hi","output","be","far","from","be","golden","it","show","well","structur","than","sánchez","and","some","lesson","from","blair","witch","be","appli","unfortun","in","weak","stori","but","still"],"filtered":["mai","big","blair","witch","fan","nonetheless","appreci","effort","look","forward","alter","especi","read","superl","throw","around","variou","imdb","comment","uniqu","intellig","futur","cult","classic","gotta","wonder","peopl","come","stuff","describ","poor","effortbr","br","becaus","ala","alter","poor","weak","movi","fail","engag","ani","everi","respect","silli","funni","horror","gore","scari","whatev","think","aspect","poor","fellow","see","thi","movi","due","sever","delus","becaus","certainli","noth","profound","smart","thi","messbr","br","okai","know","noth","stand","littl","bearabl","experi","worthwhil","ani","wai","unfortun","starter","get","veri","poor","act","stretch","sai","much","bmovi","thi","dai","featur","well","act","plot","bore","messi","dialog","mani","amateur","actual","betterbr","br","realli","direct","puzzl","expect","major","improv","blair","witch","littl","small","step","forward","instead","director","seem","worsen","time","complet","oblivi","previou","experiencesbr","br","major","flaw","alter","main","set","major","part","plot","take","place","singl","locat","main","charact","confin","sánchez","fail","give","place","ani","person","whatsoev","consid","blair","witch","forest","plai","major","part","much","charact","antagonist","three","student","think","director","realiz","thing","ne","thi","place","person","whatsoev","thank","sloppi","direct","attent","detailsbr","br","noth","salvag","die","hard","fan","blair","witch","well","follow","daniel","myrick","although","hi","output","far","golden","show","well","structur","sánchez","lesson","blair","witch","appli","unfortun","weak","stori","still"],"filtered2":["mai","big","blair","witch","fan","nonetheless","appreci","effort","look","forward","alter","especi","read","superl","throw","around","variou","imdb","comment","uniqu","intellig","futur","cult","classic","gotta","wonder","peopl","come","stuff","describ","poor","effortbr","becaus","ala","alter","poor","weak","fail","engag","ani","everi","respect","silli","funni","horror","gore","scari","whatev","think","aspect","poor","fellow","see","due","sever","delus","becaus","certainli","noth","profound","smart","messbr","okai","know","noth","stand","littl","bearabl","experi","worthwhil","ani","wai","unfortun","starter","get","veri","poor","act","stretch","bmovi","dai","featur","well","act","plot","bore","messi","dialog","mani","amateur","actual","betterbr","realli","direct","puzzl","expect","major","improv","blair","witch","littl","small","step","fo

{"value":"Like a relative that gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has its heart in the right place but trips up with a bad execution. Stephen Carpenter's writing/directing effort borrows freely from other, better films, such as Jacob's Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). For those who haven't seen either of these films, I won't give the premise away; suffice to say it's not nearly as well handled here than in those two superior films.<br /><br />Melissa Sagemiller stars as Cassie, about to go away to college. Her current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and ex-boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends, and Annabel (acerbic Eliza Dushku) are in a car accident after being pursued by two killers (?) in transparent masks. She survives the wreck, but while attending college has visions of the hospital ordeal and dead people reappear and disappear, leaving her in a state of total confusion: who is dead? Who's alive? What's real?<br /><br />Soul Survivors has the look of a bad been-there, done-that, gore-filled, blood-splattered, body-stacking teen exploitation flick. True, it has its share of killer-stalking-the-victim scenes (plentiful, repetitive, and mind-numbing), but at least it attempts to build suspense through ideas rather than cliches, unfortunately rather unsuccessfully. It breeds confusion much more often than cohesion, as the story becomes jumbled, messy and incoherent near key points of the mystery (predictable as it is.)<br /><br />Horror fans who pick up a copy will have no idea they are in for a film that is more concerned with building an uneasy facade of reality than delivering a body count. Credit goes to Carpenter for attempting to create something beyond a derivative teen horror flick; too bad he's created a derivative psychological thriller. Sagemiller also deserves kudos for showing strength in the central performance, actually developing her character and evoking some sense of emotion as the unraveling Cassie. It's great the filmmakers try something different, but the film ends up a mixed bag and failed experiment.<br /><br />4 out of

{"value":"Watching the first 30 minutes of Sands of Oblivion gave me high hopes. It seemed I was in for a cheaper version of the Mummy. The setup was promising, in the 1920's Cecil B. Demille makes his opus of the Ten Commandments. It seems in using real Egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil (don't they always?). Aware of what had been unleashed DeMille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down. Hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time. Then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site (the movie's first mistake, but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a Sci-Fi channel movie). The first sightings we get of the Anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy CG effect. Then the body counts starts. This is were the movie went south for me. The reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction. Once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do? They make the usual stop to the \"guy who knows the truth but never told anyone\". After getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site? No, they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk. Really I'm not the most motivated person but if I knew a demon from ancient Egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me I'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem. After this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the Anubis monster in the usual way, by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it's standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades. For a Sci-Fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out, which isn't saying much at all. What disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it.","finished_norm":["watch","the","minut","of","sand","of","oblivion","give","me","high","hope","it","seem","i","be","in","for","a","cheap","version","of","the","mummi","the","setup","be","promis","in","the","cecil","b","demil","make","hi","opu","of","the","ten","command","it","seem","in","us","real","egyptian","artifact","for","the","movi","set","thei","unleash","a","ancient","and","terribl","evil","do","not","thei","alwai","awar","of","what","have","be","unleash","demil","order","the","entir","set","buri","instead","of","the","usual","practic","of","tear","it","down","hopefulli","the","evil","will","be","buri","with","it","for","all","time","then","we","switch","to","present","dai","where","a","team","be","attempt","to","excav","the","site","the","movi","mistak","but","hei","that","period","costum","be","expens","and","thi","be","a","scifi","channel","movi","the","sight","we","get","of","the","anubi","monster","be","good","do","and","it","a","costum","that","thei","put","some","effort","into","and","not","the","usual","cheesi","cg","effect","then","the","bodi","count","start","thi","be","be","the","movi","go","south","for","me","the","reaction","to","the","fact","that","peopl","be","dye","in","gruesom","and","strang","wai","get","a","strang","subdu","reaction","onc","thei","realiz","that","the","ancient","evil","have","again","be","unleash","and","be","on","a","kill","spree","what","do","the","stock","issu","lead","man","and","ladi","do","thei","make","the","usual","stop","to","the","gui","who","know","the","truth","but","never","tell","anyon","after","get","that","vital","inform","do","thei","share","it","with","the","comrad","at","the","dig","site","no","thei","stop","off","at","a","hotel","for","a","refresh","shower","and","some","pleasant","small","talk","realli","i","be","not","the","much","motiv","person","but","if","i","know","a","demon","from","ancient","egypt","be","on","the","loos","and","kill","everyon","in","sight","and","would","be","come","after","me","i","have","put","a","littl","hustl","in","my","step","to","solv","the","problem","after","thi","overlong","and","pointless","middl","section","thei","get","around","to","destroi","the","anubi","monster","in","the","usual","wai","by","race","around","in","dune","buggi","and","shoot","it","with","a","rocket","launcher","while","it","stand","by","a","pile","of","phosphor","grenad","for","a","scifi","movi","it","be","abov","the","usual","crap","thei","put","out","which","be","not","sai","much","at","all","what","disappoint","me","be","thi","can","have","be","a","lot","much","if","someon","have","write","a","decent","script","for","it"],"filtered":["watch","minut","sand","oblivion","give","high","hope","seem","cheap","version","mummi","setup","promis","cecil","b","demil","make","hi","opu","ten","command","seem","us","real","egyptian","artifact","movi","set","thei","unleash","ancient","terribl","evil","thei","alwai","awar","unleash","demil","order","entir","set","buri","instead","usual","practic","tear","hopefulli","evil","buri","time","switch","present","dai","team","attempt","excav","site","movi","mistak","hei","period","costum","expens","thi","scifi","channel","movi","sight","get","anubi","monster","good","costum","thei","put","effort","usual","cheesi","cg","effect","bodi","count","start","thi","movi","go","south","reaction","fact","peopl","dye","gruesom","strang","wai","get","strang","subdu","reaction","onc","thei","realiz","ancient","evil","unleash","kill","spree","stock","issu","lead","man","ladi","thei","make","usual","stop","gui","know","truth","never","tell","anyon","get","vital","inform","thei","share","comrad","dig","site","thei","stop","hotel","refresh","shower","pleasant","small","talk","realli","much","motiv","person","know","demon","ancient","egypt","loos","kill","everyon","sight","come","put","littl","hustl","step","solv","problem","thi","overlong","pointless","middl","section","thei","get","around","destroi","anubi","monster","usual","wai","race","around","dune","buggi","shoot","rocket","launcher","stand","pile","phosphor","grenad","scifi","movi","abov","usual","crap","thei","put","sai","much","disappoint","thi","lot","much","someon","write","decent","script"],"filtered2":["watch","minut","sand","oblivion","give","high","hope","seem","cheap","version","mummi","setup","promis","cecil","b","demil","make","opu","ten","command","seem","us","real","egyptian","artifact","set","unleash","ancient","terribl","evil","alwai","awar","unleash","demil","order","entir","set","buri","instead","usual","practic","tear","hopefulli","evil","buri","time","switch","present","dai","team","attempt","excav","site","mistak","hei","period","costum","expens","scifi","channel","sight","get","anubi","monster","good","costum","put","effort","usual","cheesi","cg","effect","bodi","count","start","go","south","reaction","fact","peopl","dye","gruesom","strang","wai","get","strang","subdu","reaction","onc","realiz","ancient","evil","unleash","kill","spree","stock","

{"value":"I am a big fan of Ludlum's work, and of the Covert-one books, and I had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film. Imagine my excitement, then, on learning that such a movie actually existed! The 'Hades Factor' being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start.<br /><br />From the outset the film was disappointing. Simple elements from the film such as Griffin's first meeting with Smith are needlessly different from the book, and much less exhilarating. Several characters are poorly cast, too. For starters Dorff is woeful as Smith. Not a bad actor, just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft, and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of John Smith.<br /><br />Re-naming, re-assignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film. For example the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire back-story of the virus, including the involvement of VAXHAM makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy. Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book, and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat (not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book) is another big mistake.<br /><br />Rachel Russel is presumably supposed to be Randi Russel from the book. Not only is she supposed to be the sister of Sophie Amsden (should be called Sophia Russel) but she is also supposed to work from the CIA, NOT \"Covert-one\". Which brings me to my final point, and I think one of the most important. COVERT-ONE doesn't even exist at this point! Not until the second book of the series is Covert-One devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorism.<br /><br />To be honest I could go on all day. In short - if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation, I'm afraid you'll be bitterly disappointed. Even as an action movie it is thoroughly average, mainly due to very lack-luster editing and poor effects. The bumbled story line and dull-as-ditch-water script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film.","finished_norm":["i","be","a","big","fan","of","ludlum","work","and","of","the","coverton","book","and","i","have","often","think","how","incred","thei","would","be","make","into","a","film","imagin","my","excit","then","on","learn","that","such","a","movi","actual","exist","the","hade","factor","be","the","in","the","seri","seem","a","obviou","place","to","startbr","br","from","the","outset","the","film","be","disappoint","simpl","elem","from","the","film","such","a","griffin","meet","with","smith","be","needlessli","differ","from","the","book","and","much","littl","exhilar","sever","charact","be","poorli","cast","too","for","starter","dorff","be","woeful","a","smith","not","a","bad","actor","just","a","incredibli","bad","choic","a","he","be","far","too","soft","and","fail","to","exhibit","mani","of","the","featur","that","be","definit","of","john","smithbr","br","renam","reassign","and","even","omiss","of","certain","charact","far","degrad","thi","film","for","exampl","the","remov","of","victor","tremont","and","the","entir","backstori","of","the","viru","includ","the","involv","of","vaxham","make","the","entir","point","to","the","film","somewhat","hazi","marti","zellerbach","be","a","veri","larg","part","of","the","book","and","in","the","seat","he","take","vari","much","a","back","seat","not","to","mention","that","the","film","charact","share","noth","in","common","with","the","charact","in","the","book","be","anoth","big","mistakebr","br","rachel","russel","be","presum","suppos","to","be","randi","russel","from","the","book","not","onli","be","she","suppos","to","be","the","sister","of","sophi","amsden","should","be","call","sophia","russel","but","she","be","conjur","suppos","to","work","from","the","cia","not","coverton","which","bring","me","to","my","final","point","and","i","think","on","of","the","much","import","coverton","doe","not","even","exist","at","thi","point","not","until","the","book","of","the","seri","be","coverton","devis","by","the","presid","a","a","prevent","measur","against","far","biolog","terrorismbr","br","to","be","honest","i","can","go","on","all","dai","in","short","if","you","like","the","book","and","want","to","see","a","good","adapt","i","be","afraid","you","will","be","bitterli","disappoint","even","a","a","action","movi","it","be","thoroughli","averag","mainli","due","to","veri","lacklust","edit","and","poor","effect","the","bumbl","stori","line","and","dullasditchwat","script","be","the","final","nail","in","the","veri","cheap","coffin","of","thi","film"],"filtered":["big","fan","ludlum","work","coverton","book","often","think","incred","thei","make","film","imagin","excit","learn","movi","actual","exist","hade","factor","seri","seem","obviou","place","startbr","br","outset","film","disappoint","simpl","elem","film","griffin","meet","smith","needlessli","differ","book","much","littl","exhilar","sever","charact","poorli","cast","starter","dorff","woeful","smith","bad","actor","incredibli","bad","choic","far","soft","fail","exhibit","mani","featur","definit","john","smithbr","br","renam","reassign","even","omiss","certain","charact","far","degrad","thi","film","exampl","remov","victor","tremont","entir","backstori","viru","includ","involv","vaxham","make","entir","point","film","somewhat","hazi","marti","zellerbach","veri","larg","part","book","seat","take","vari","much","back","seat","mention","film","charact","share","noth","common","charact","book","anoth","big","mistakebr","br","rachel","russel","presum","suppos","randi","russel","book","onli","suppos","sister","sophi","amsden","call","sophia","russel","conjur","suppos","work","cia","coverton","bring","final","point","think","much","import","coverton","doe","even","exist","thi","point","book","seri","coverton","devis","presid","prevent","measur","far","biolog","terrorismbr","br","honest","go","dai","short","like","book","want","see","good","adapt","afraid","bitterli","disappoint","even","action","movi","thoroughli","averag","mainli","due","veri","lacklust","edit","poor","effect","bumbl","stori","line","dullasditchwat","script","final","nail","veri","cheap","coffin","thi","film"],"filtered2":["big","fan","ludlum","work","coverton","book","often","think","incred","make","imagin","excit","learn","actual","exist","hade","factor","seem","obviou","place","startbr","outset","disappoint","simpl","elem","griffin","meet","smith","needlessli","differ","book","littl","exhilar","sever","charact","poorli","cast","starter","dorff","woeful","smith","bad","actor","incredibli","bad","choic","far","soft","fail","exhibit","mani","featur","definit","john","smithbr","renam","reassign","even","omiss","certain","charact","far","degrad","exampl","remov","victor","tremont","entir","backstori","viru","includ","involv","vaxham","make","entir","point","somewhat","hazi","marti","zellerbach","veri","larg","part","book","seat","take","vari","back","seat","mention","charact","share","noth","common","charact","book","anoth","big","mistakeb

{"value":"The Invisible Man is a fantastic movie from 1933, a cutting edge film for it's time where objects appeared to rest on top of a man who was truly invisible. Go ahead, take a look at the film, you will be shocked that it was made in 1933, it was the first true special effects movie. Come 2000, computer aided special effects seem like child's play, audiences are not blown away by special effects, instead they are disappointed if they are not done right. The special effects in Hollow Man, the update of the HG Wells story, are OK, but not the biggest problem with this film directed by Paul Verhoeven, who you might remember from Showgirls and Total Recall. Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a scientist dabbling in the world of bio-invisibilation (yeah, I know that's not a word) but of course is battling higher ups who are threatening to take away the team's funding. So, as movie characters who are about to have their funding cutoff are prone to do, he makes the ultimate sacrifice and becomes a guinea pig for the invisibilation (yeah, I know, I used that non-word again) process. The process has dire consequences, no Caine does not die, but instead becomes a horny, violent creature, aka a guy. Now that he's invisible, Caine stalks a sexy neighbor, a co-worker, former girlfriend Linda (Elisabeth Shue), and the man who took away his funding. Then a funny thing happens, Caine becomes a new supernatural being, \"The Thing That Won't Die.\" Laughing in the face of all things natural, Caine faces down death and spits in it's face, as it take what feels like hours for this creature to die, dragging the ending of the movie out. The movie is silly, stupid, and finally laughable with the way realism is sometimes used, sometimes not. There are neat possibilities in Hollow Man, but of course, not one of them is explored. For a more interesting look at an invisible being, get ready for some good old-fashioned black and white cinema, and check out the 1933 Invisible Man. Kevin Bacon will still be invisible when you come back, probably still alive at the bottom of a

{"value":"This film just goes to prove that not every film made during the glory days of Hollywood is worth seeing. Just because you've got an excellent ensemble cast doesn't mean that this can overcome a script that was probably written by a chimp! Think about it--the film featured Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Charles Boyer, Gloria Graham, Lillian Gish and Paul Stewart and yet it still was a bad film! The basic premise of the film isn't bad--a private psychiatric hospital where the staff are more screwed up than the patients! Also, the subplot involving the overworked husband and wife (Widmark and Graham) had a lot of promise. However, the script was handled with all the finesse and deftness of a drunk buffalo--with bellicose and way over the top scenes again and again in the film. In fact, it was less like a drama and more like a very bad episode of \"General Hospital\". Subtle, this film ain't!! Realistic, this film ain't!! <br /><br />While most of the reason this film reeked was the awful script, but I also blame the producers as well for miscasting and misusing come veteran actors. For example, Paul Stewart may not be a household name but this character actor had exceptional talent--especially when playing gangsters in Film Noir movies. Yet here, Stewart is cast as a very nondescript psychiatrist with some bizarre European accent--it just didn't work since this was well outside his acting range and his character was totally undeveloped and one-dimensional. Also, Charles Boyer just seemed hopelessly miscast and totally out of place. Seeing this fine romantic actor as a psychiatrist in the heartland of America just seemed bizarre.<br /><br />Overall, this is a rather awful film. It is very watchable in a train wreck sort of way but it certainly isn't very pretty. My wife and I disliked much of the movie but also felt it could have been very good had the writing been competent.<br /><br />PS--In a case of art imitating life, Oscar Levant played one of the patients.

{"value":"I picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales. Well, for the previous, it is better than daytime television....though I'm not sure how much.<br /><br />It does have its points but after about the first 20-30 minutes, the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for TV movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together. In short, a terrible Sci Fi channel type movie.<br /><br />It has its points such as the future is dirty, like \"Blade Runner\" showed ..... of course, this is no \"Blade Runner\". The Captain looks, sort of feels like actor Robert Forster, the kind of person one might want to be around.<br /><br />But unfortunately, it rather ends up feeling like a bad \"Andromeda\" rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of \"Aliens\", the mystic is vampire Willow sexually intensified, and the new Captain might as well be like Jan-Michael Vincent running around on \"Danger Island\" in the \"Banana Splits\"; he only put on the uniform with the epaulets; he's got very little right to it. All of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the 'Eureka Maru' as they are fighting a class of 'people' who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities.......just like the Nietzcheans in \"Andromeda\".<br /><br />It might have a redeeming feature with Michael Ironside, but after a while, one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot! He probably had fun doing it, but it doesn't help the movie much.<br /><br />It's ..... \"okay\". Okay in the way that one might watch the DVD once without turning it off; if they watch it with commercials, they will probably change the channel. One might watch it once .......... but a few hours later, be wondering what it was that made them watch it all.<br /><br />For me, that was the femme fatale ............. when she was

{"value":"Contrary to most other commentators, I deeply hate this series.<br /><br />It starts out looking interesting, with mysterious aliens and giant robots, and I kept my hopes up until the very last episode. At the end of it, I still didn't understand what the alien attacks were all about (maybe I missed something, who knows?), and realized that I had sat through 26 episodes consisting mainly of the characters' own self-hating, selfishness and self-pitying. It actually flips between alien/robot fights and these dark, depressing blinking-on-and-off scenes where one or more characters can just say or shout \"I hate me/you/it\" 10-12 times in a row.<br /><br />I can't really see either Shinji or Asuka (two of the main characters) showing growth or change. (Nor can I see any of the other characters learning or growing either, for that matter.) I wanted to kick them and tell them to get a bloody life during the first episodes, and the feeling didn't change during the last ones. Shinji truly possesses the kind of helpless hopelessness that makes people angry rather than charitable, and Asuka is such an infuriating know-it-all that I wanted to smash the TV screen every time she came into view. Oh, and more than anyone else, these two hate everything, and say it veeeeeeeery often.<br /><br />I'm otherwise a big fan of animé and manga, and never before have I disliked one so much. I read that the series creator/writer wrote this while suffering from a depression, and I can believe that; it made me depressed to watch it. Is that the aim of this series? I'm honestly asking. Is it designed to make the viewer confused and annoyed? And if suffering from a depression, why just not write a book or biography about it, instead of mixing it up with aliens and mecha's? This alien war plot, as far as I could tell, lead to absolutely nowhere.<br /><br />Finally, since I'm truly fascinated by how many people claim to love this patchwork of dead-end plots, I can't help but wonder how many of them actually find it good, and how many say they do because they've been told it is.","finished_norm":["contrari","to","much","other","comment","i","deepli","hate","thi","seriesbr","br","it","start","out","look","interest","with","mysteri","alien","and","giant","robot","and","i","keep","my","hope","up","until","the","veri","last","episod","at","the","end","of","it","i","still","do","not","understand","what","the","alien","attack","be","all","about","mayb","i","miss","someth","who","know","and","realiz","that","i","have","sit","through","episod","consist","mainli","of","the","charact","own","selfhat","selfish","and","selfpiti","it","actual","flip","between","alienrobot","fight","and","thi","dark","depress","blinkingonandoff","scene","where","on","or","much","charact","can","just","sai","or","shout","i","hate","meyouit","time","in","a","rowbr","br","i","ca","not","realli","see","either","shinji","or","asuka","two","of","the","main","charact","show","growth","or","chang","nor","can","i","see","ani","of","the","other","charact","learn","or","grow","either","for","that","matt","i","want","to","kick","them","and","tell","them","to","get","a","bloodi","life","dure","the","episod","and","the","feel","do","not","chang","dure","the","last","on","shinji","truli","possess","the","kind","of","helpless","hopeless","that","make","peopl","angri","rather","than","charit","and","asuka","be","such","a","infuri","knowital","that","i","want","to","smash","the","tv","screen","everi","time","she","come","into","view","oh","and","much","than","anyon","els","thi","two","hate","everyth","and","sai","it","veeeeeeeeri","oftenbr","br","i","be","otherwis","a","big","fan","of","animé","and","manga","and","never","befor","have","i","dislik","on","so","much","i","read","that","the","seri","creatorwrit","write","thi","while","suffer","from","a","depress","and","i","can","believ","that","it","make","me","depress","to","watch","it","be","that","the","aim","of","thi","seri","i","be","honestli","ask","be","it","design","to","make","the","viewer","confus","and","annoi","and","if","suffer","from","a","depress","why","just","not","write","a","book","or","biographi","about","it","instead","of","mix","it","up","with","alien","and","mecha","thi","alien","war","plot","a","far","a","i","can","tell","lead","to","absolut","nowherebr","br","final","sinc","i","be","truli","fascin","by","how","mani","peopl","claim","to","love","thi","patchwork","of","deadend","plot","i","ca","not","help","but","wonder","how","mani","of","them","actual","find","it","good","and","how","mani","sai","thei","do","becaus","thei","have","be","tell","it","be"],"filtered":["contrari","much","comment","deepli","hate","thi","seriesbr","br","start","look","interest","mysteri","alien","giant","robot","keep","hope","veri","last","episod","end","still","understand","alien","attack","mayb","miss","someth","know","realiz","sit","episod","consist","mainli","charact","selfhat","selfish","selfpiti","actual","flip","alienrobot","fight","thi","dark","depress","blinkingonandoff","scene","much","charact","sai","shout","hate","meyouit","time","rowbr","br","ca","realli","see","either","shinji","asuka","two","main","charact","show","growth","chang","see","ani","charact","learn","grow","either","matt","want","kick","tell","get","bloodi","life","dure","episod","feel","chang","dure","last","shinji","truli","possess","kind","helpless","hopeless","make","peopl","angri","rather","charit","asuka","infuri","knowital","want","smash","tv","screen","everi","time","come","view","oh","much","anyon","els","thi","two","hate","everyth","sai","veeeeeeeeri","oftenbr","br","otherwis","big","fan","animé","manga","never","befor","dislik","much","read","seri","creatorwrit","write","thi","suffer","depress","believ","make","depress","watch","aim","thi","seri","honestli","ask","design","make","viewer","confus","annoi","suffer","depress","write","book","biographi","instead","mix","alien","mecha","thi","alien","war","plot","far","tell","lead","absolut","nowherebr","br","final","sinc","truli","fascin","mani","peopl","claim","love","thi","patchwork","deadend","plot","ca","help","wonder","mani","actual","find","good","mani","sai","thei","becaus","thei","tell"],"filtered2":["contrari","comment","deepli","hate","seriesbr","start","look","interest","mysteri","alien","giant","robot","keep","hope","veri","last","end","still","understand","alien","attack","mayb","miss","someth","know","realiz","sit","consist","mainli","charact","selfhat","selfish","selfpiti","actual","flip","alienrobot","fight","dark","depress","blinkingonandoff","scene","charact","shout","hate","meyouit","time","rowbr","ca","realli","see","either","shinji","asuka","two","main","charact","show","growth","chang","see","ani","charact","learn","grow","either","matt","want","kick","tell","get","bloodi","life","dure","feel","chang","dure","last","shinji","truli","possess","kind","helpless","hopeless","make","peopl","angri","rather","charit","asuka","infuri","knowital","want","smash","tv","screen","everi","time","come","view","oh","anyon","els","two","ha

{"value":"I remember when this piece of trash came out, all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken Barbra Streisand years to get the film made. Well it couldn't have taken that many years; the play only opened in 1975, eight years previously. It made a Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh, who probably should have been cast in the film, but NOOOOO...the Great STAR BARBRA HAD TO DO IT HER WAY. AND WITH MUSIC NO LESS! This film is a total disaster from start to finish. For one thing, Barbra was FORTY YEARS OLD when she made it and she looked every minute of it. There was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study Torah. And then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy. I get the impression that Streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make-up; she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl. And as if that is not bad enough, she gets involved with both her schoolmate Avigdor (Mandy Patinkin, whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end) AND his fiancée (Amy Irving, who does her usual sleepwalker routine, a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing). Yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl; I won't even bother to mention the \"wedding night\" scene.<br /><br />Then there is the music. Nine totally forgettable songs, all sung by Streisand via voice-over (presumably as a look inside her mind), and each one as intrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard.<br /><br />I won't say that Streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here; some of the visuals are lovely (Patinkin's backside especially), and she has a good eye for balance. The problem with this movie is that she won't get out of her own way.

{"value":"I have seen Dolemite and also (Avenging) Disco Godfather, two other fine works of the blaxploitation canon from our friend Rudy Ray Moore. But this film, The Human Tornado (aka Dolemite 2) will always hold a special place in my heart. For sheer goofiness, lack of skill in film production, and absolute enthusiasm (frankly a little too much), The Human Tornado cannot be topped.<br /><br />The opening scene sets the tone. Our old pal Dolemite is shacking up with a white woman, when some racist local cops raid the house for no good reason, and wouldn't you know it! The woman in bed with ol' Dole is none other than the sheriff's wife. Her cry when she sees him: \"He made me do it!\" Dolemite's cry: \"&$*@$ are you for real???\" Subtlety was never his strong point.<br /><br />Highlights? The cameo by a very young Ernie Hudson (of Ghostbusters fame), the continuity errors (characters looking one way in one shot, and another in the next, Dolemite's suit changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act), and Queen Bee's demonic eyes in her first scene.<br /><br />But the real joy here is Rudy Ray Moore himself. Did the man really think he looked cool in this movie? I certainly don't know why, but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has. Whether it be jumping totally naked off a cliff, or barking orders to his gang in rhyme (e.g: Quick! Into the cave! I have a plan to let that mother $*@(%& dig his own grave!) the man commits totally. Certainly he goes overboard, nevermore so than any time he's doing kung fu. The climactic battle is filmed at high speed, but occassionaly slows down to let Rudy pose and grits his teeth. I'm not sure if they wanted it too look like they sped up the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was that fast. In any event, \"The Matrix\" it is not.<br /><br />Human Tornado, much like the original Dolemite, is an incompetent film of enormous proportions. But at least it's fun, and certainly you have to give credit to these people for the effort. Just not that much.

{"value":"Alien Hunter: 5 out of 10: Is it me or does every movie that starts in Roswell, New Mexico suck. Take Alien mixed with The Thing, mixed with Contact, mixed with of all things On the Beach, The Andromeda Strain, the classroom scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark and a throw in a little Stargate to boot. <br /><br />Derivative doesn't even begin to describe this movie. Of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right? Nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease. (James Spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable Leslie Stefanson asks to join him. he turns her down. AGGH!) <br /><br />In fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it. I mean if your going to have impossibly good-looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an Antarctica research base why not go for broke.<br /><br />With about 30 seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie Alien Hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci-fi adventure. Needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the Alien itself is a horribly clichéd artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title. <br /><br />I also inquired during viewing what is with the Children of the Corn in space motif. (Note that since Jason of Friday the 13th fame, Pinhead from Hellraiser and that Leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield?) The characters in the cornfield dress like Logan's Run extras and I was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them.<br /><br />That however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant. The acting is mostly fine as Spader reprises his Stargate role while Stefanson and Janine Eser model the latest in Antarctic beachwear. John Lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it.<br /><br />Alien Hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper Children of The Corn in Space movie.","finished_norm":["alien","hunter","out","of","be","it","me","or","doe","everi","movi","that","start","in","roswel","new","mexico","suck","take","alien","mix","with","the","thing","mix","with","contact","mix","with","of","all","thing","on","the","beach","the","andromeda","strain","the","classroom","scene","from","raider","of","the","lose","ark","and","a","throw","in","a","littl","stargat","to","boot","br","br","deriv","doe","not","even","begin","to","describ","thi","movi","of","cours","with","noth","origin","plot","wise","thei","amp","up","the","gore","and","sex","right","no","gore","be","a","blink","and","you","miss","it","affair","and","sex","be","all","teas","jame","spader","causal","mention","he","ne","a","shower","and","the","delect","lesli","stefanson","ask","to","join","him","he","turn","her","down","aggh","br","br","in","fact","if","a","movi","ever","ne","a","shower","scene","to","liven","thing","up","thi","be","it","i","mean","if","your","go","to","have","impossibli","goodlook","woman","in","white","bath","suit","wander","around","a","antarctica","research","base","why","not","go","for","brokebr","br","with","about","second","of","actual","thrill","in","the","entir","movi","alien","hunter","be","remark","seriou","and","slow","go","for","a","scifi","adventur","ne","a","much","well","plot","twist","to","liven","it","up","and","by","the","wai","the","alien","itself","be","a","horribli","clichéd","artific","and","have","virtual","no","screen","time","for","someon","who","share","half","the","titl","br","br","i","conjur","inquir","dure","view","what","be","with","the","child","of","the","corn","in","space","motif","note","that","sinc","jason","of","fridai","the","th","fame","pinhead","from","hellrais","and","that","leprechaun","have","all","travel","to","space","to","slai","nubil","teenag","why","not","the","cornfield","the","charact","in","the","cornfield","dress","like","logan","run","extra","and","i","be","just","wait","for","the","stalk","to","come","aliv","and","attack","thembr","br","that","howev","would","have","be","excit","and","appar","against","thi","movi","coven","the","act","be","mostli","fine","a","spader","repris","hi","stargat","role","while","stefanson","and","janin","eser","model","the","late","in","antarct","beachwear","john","lynch","howev","read","the","whole","script","and","act","the","like","the","insan","bad","gui","good","befor","the","stori","would","indic","itbr","br","alien","hunter","be","a","disappoint","deriv","slog","that","make","me","pine","for","a","proper","child","of","the","corn","in","space","movi"],"filtered":["alien","hunter","doe","everi","movi","start","roswel","new","mexico","suck","take","alien","mix","thing","mix","contact","mix","thing","beach","andromeda","strain","classroom","scene","raider","lose","ark","throw","littl","stargat","boot","br","br","deriv","doe","even","begin","describ","thi","movi","cours","noth","origin","plot","wise","thei","amp","gore","sex","right","gore","blink","miss","affair","sex","teas","jame","spader","causal","mention","ne","shower","delect","lesli","stefanson","ask","join","turn","aggh","br","br","fact","movi","ever","ne","shower","scene","liven","thing","thi","mean","go","impossibli","goodlook","woman","white","bath","suit","wander","around","antarctica","research","base","go","brokebr","br","second","actual","thrill","entir","movi","alien","hunter","remark","seriou","slow","go","scifi","adventur","ne","much","well","plot","twist","liven","wai","alien","horribli","clichéd","artific","virtual","screen","time","someon","share","half","titl","br","br","conjur","inquir","dure","view","child","corn","space","motif","note","sinc","jason","fridai","th","fame","pinhead","hellrais","leprechaun","travel","space","slai","nubil","teenag","cornfield","charact","cornfield","dress","like","logan","run","extra","wait","stalk","come","aliv","attack","thembr","br","howev","excit","appar","thi","movi","coven","act","mostli","fine","spader","repris","hi","stargat","role","stefanson","janin","eser","model","late","antarct","beachwear","john","lynch","howev","read","whole","script","act","like","insan","bad","gui","good","befor","stori","indic","itbr","br","alien","hunter","disappoint","deriv","slog","make","pine","proper","child","corn","space","movi"],"filtered2":["alien","hunter","doe","everi","start","roswel","new","mexico","suck","take","alien","mix","thing","mix","contact","mix","thing","beach","andromeda","strain","classroom","scene","raider","lose","ark","throw","littl","stargat","boot","deriv","doe","even","begin","describ","cours","noth","origin","plot","wise","amp","gore","sex","right","gore","blink","miss","affair","sex","teas","jame","spader","causal","mention","ne","shower","delect","lesli","stefanson","ask","join","turn","aggh","fact","ever","ne","shower","scene","liven","thing","mean","go","impossibli","goodlook","woman","white","bath","suit","wander","around","antarctica","research","base","go","brokebr","second","actual","
