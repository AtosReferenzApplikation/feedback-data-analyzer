{"value":"A young American woman visits her Irish roots and fends off a druid witch who is out to possess her. Sounds intriguing but after an interesting start, I got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it was going. The movie seems to be dithering in two directions -- are we watching the travails of the Irish-American woman battling her alcohol problem or are we watching a straight off horror flick about an evil witch that returns from the past? The director can't seem to decide. The two doesn't seem to gel and in the end you get nowhere. This could be so much better done and the story seemed to drag towards the end. This was most boring and disappointing.","finished_norm":["a","young","american","woman","visit","her","irish","root","and","fend","off","a","druid","witch","who","be","out","to","possess","her","sound","intrigu","but","after","a","interest","start","i","get","lose","and","spend","much","of","the","time","wonder","where","it","be","go","the","movi","seem","to","be","dither","in","two","direct","be","we","watch","the","travail","of","the","irishamerican","woman","battl","her","alcohol","problem","or","be","we","watch","a","straight","off","horror","flick","about","a","evil","witch","that","return","from","the","past","the","director","ca","not","seem","to","decid","the","two","doe","not","seem","to","gel","and","in","the","end","you","get","nowher","thi","can","be","so","much","well","do","and","the","stori","seem","to","drag","toward","the","end","thi","be","much","bore","and","disappoint"],"filtered":["young","american","woman","visit","irish","root","fend","druid","witch","possess","sound","intrigu","interest","start","get","lose","spend","much","time","wonder","go","movi","seem","dither","two","direct","watch","travail","irishamerican","woman","battl","alcohol","problem","watch","straight","horror","flick","evil","witch","return","past","director","ca","seem","decid","two","doe","seem","gel","end","get","nowher","thi","much","well","stori","seem","drag","toward","end","thi","much","bore","disappoint"],"filtered2":["young","american","woman","visit","irish","root","fend","druid","witch","possess","sound","intrigu","interest","start","get","lose","spend","time","wonder","go","seem","dither","two","direct","watch","travail","irishamerican","woman","battl","alcohol","problem","watch","straight","horror","flick","evil","witch","return","past","director","ca","seem","decid","two","doe","seem","gel","end","get","nowher","well","stori","seem","drag","toward","end","bore","disappoint"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,8,17,18,20,24,35,47,58,60,70,71,81,83,102,108,135,167,175,178,187,221,223,249,257,283,321,440,488,548,563,764,786,799,1017,1135,1167,1304,1362,1905,2520,7075,8228,8468],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,8,17,18,20,24,35,47,58,60,70,71,81,83,102,108,135,167,175,178,187,221,223,249,257,283,321,440,488,548,563,764,786,799,1017,1135,1167,1304,1362,1905,2520,7075,8228,8468],"values":[1.5932680941439847,0.9708269144703846,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,1.2770536940105968,1.2153159934048174,1.165345040023057,2.6420723132238515,5.852676051596536,3.412938870621443,1.865701314626681,1.838176641236591,4.189351572503368,1.9214926742550966,1.949757232424728,2.292318797740072,2.087553710177271,2.138507503627933,2.366244071437088,2.4609576687888097,2.3791142619576227,2.532833256045391,2.4732161909892554,2.6423424573643777,2.825563294794476,2.6754694156628323,2.7602659523229094,2.7678802023081546,3.09496984188738,3.212973749990824,3.3933092088131493,3.459754308221302,3.459754308221302,3.7465885637507435,3.900174431363043,3.7636829971100436,4.0536665665501035,8.983842994962517,4.2574141875167335,4.4637506205145625,4.396611317676934,5.00274712124725,5.426230734858092,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[8.162819775723969E-5,8.10777597366478E-5,8.170806200697174E-5,8.123595195423032E-5,8.123728291384161E-5,8.112372942663911E-5,8.136500276444032E-5,8.108943440427194E-5,8.127175301341764E-5,9.016657351819462E-5,0.7676146795900127,8.095853817889795E-5,8.246958914690489E-5,8.364603595762547E-5,8.101757230038665E-5,8.079367468633941E-5,8.280897183679558E-5,8.137262605103055E-5,8.112016779569873E-5,8.118740199188113E-5,8.197293772352124E-5,8.14532457323063E-5,8.154599260955349E-5,0.05475636903298863,8.226034712447821E-5,8.183014866707722E-5,8.527013266260748E-5,8.098260640999263E-5,8.098477288436544E-5,8.118994734849782E-5,8.291562067261775E-5,8.136791120221315E-5,0.11508503289376015,8.15967871292397E-5,8.107075233518647E-5,8.144494729960352E-5,8.098951741540332E-5,8.10373762614174E-5,8.079326877238535E-5,8.08142302737671E-5,8.09961332845173E-5,8.18504708648189E-5,8.143455422619768E-5,8.11125847629234E-5,8.209818771953215E-5,8.114371621619308E-5,8.383971896208173E-5,8.260683145686812E-5,8.083431702793802E-5,8.101296581192751E-5,8.098486746320662E-5,8.326408605915554E-5,8.101417113041445E-5,8.08070558168126E-5,8.169402889820835E-5,8.103503823025971E-5,0.05633992235435996,8.096825482927044E-5,8.083338222543476E-5,8.121933790096399E-5,8.202496547299295E-5,8.121396477977859E-5,8.081842786900998E-5,8.100660120037014E-5,8.079424598127288E-5,8.26636573717466E-5,8.149025048391824E-5,8.131666431916487E-5,8.124554922107232E-5,8.154170216269627E-5,8.079129847904392E-5,8.124725249595266E-5,8.256502899588683E-5,8.09360809735448E-5,8.293920680726685E-5,8.11500677489540

{"value":"The first five minutes of this movie showed potential. After that, it went straight from something possibly decent to some sort of illegitimate comedy. The best part is that I couldn't stop thinking of Supertroopers thanks to Joey Kern. I would recommend watching this movie for the sheer fact of learning how not to make a movie. There are so many scenes in this movie that makes one just stop and wonder if the entire cast and crew just stopped caring at some point. The thing that amazes me most about this movie is that it grossed $22 million in the box office and only cost about $1.5 million to make. Congrats to Lion's Gate for being able to pull that one off.","finished_norm":["the","five","minut","of","thi","movi","show","potenti","after","that","it","go","straight","from","someth","possibli","decent","to","some","sort","of","illegitim","comedi","the","well","part","be","that","i","can","not","stop","think","of","supertroop","thank","to","joei","kern","i","would","recommend","watch","thi","movi","for","the","sheer","fact","of","learn","how","not","to","make","a","movi","there","be","so","mani","scene","in","thi","movi","that","make","on","just","stop","and","wonder","if","the","entir","cast","and","crow","just","stop","care","at","some","point","the","thing","that","amaz","me","much","about","thi","movi","be","that","it","gross","million","in","the","box","offic","and","onli","cost","about","million","to","make","congrat","to","lion","gate","for","be","abl","to","pull","that","on","off"],"filtered":["five","minut","thi","movi","show","potenti","go","straight","someth","possibli","decent","sort","illegitim","comedi","well","part","stop","think","supertroop","thank","joei","kern","recommend","watch","thi","movi","sheer","fact","learn","make","movi","mani","scene","thi","movi","make","stop","wonder","entir","cast","crow","stop","care","point","thing","amaz","much","thi","movi","gross","million","box","offic","onli","cost","million","make","congrat","lion","gate","abl","pull"],"filtered2":["five","minut","show","potenti","go","straight","someth","possibli","decent","sort","illegitim","comedi","well","part","stop","think","supertroop","thank","joei","kern","recommend","watch","sheer","fact","learn","make","mani","scene","make","stop","wonder","entir","cast","crow","stop","care","point","thing","amaz","gross","million","box","offic","onli","cost","million","make","congrat","lion","gate","abl","pull"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,7,11,12,19,20,28,29,50,53,59,61,66,92,97,127,175,198,205,269,298,309,315,430,454,505,544,547,548,558,587,651,654,685,769,807,837,1626,1655,2547,2704,4454],"values":[3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,6,7,11,12,19,20,28,29,50,53,59,61,66,92,97,127,175,198,205,269,298,309,315,430,454,505,544,547,548,558,587,651,654,685,769,807,837,1626,1655,2547,2704,4454],"values":[1.8599301468615699,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.312380678011735,1.165345040023057,1.5452294193519092,1.3195384777338066,1.717994385570355,1.7003182735607676,1.8693254449200722,1.8818517047392527,1.929723173391612,2.0489535369135887,2.0545557924622586,2.4359679371086367,2.3791142619576227,2.5439726117360975,2.571852579609833,2.76533567167316,2.7819920465008363,2.848772527704847,8.562938124241386,3.2189558216683714,3.2556198060399626,3.3956930001684253,3.4222967456864013,3.432149042129413,3.459754308221302,3.4572130107926293,3.6105180246075443,3.5474598886404074,3.634471265630037,3.607563812710113,3.857614816944247,7.800348862726086,3.7881170224473255,4.613282354485526,4.760735085628657,5.463272006538442,5.604922523601468,6.137727054086234]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.33889895996063E-5,9.275924581017267E-5,9.34803604958472E-5,9.294022997702256E-5,9.294175269805172E-5,9.281183870109087E-5,9.308787411352996E-5,9.277260253546226E-5,9.298118916558682E-5,1.0315755373609222E-4,0.9489432099492578,9.26228471008705E-5,9.435160661060938E-5,9.569755301135705E-5,9.269038671474419E-5,9.243423047800088E-5,9.473988673153949E-5,9.309659574467765E-5,9.280776391904267E-5,9.28846850543921E-5,9.378339886025645E-5,9.318883091319841E-5,9.329494053453775E-5,9.339545536908589E-5,0.04376002870622817,9.362003710447145E-5,9.755564561241373E-5,9.265038302405806E-5,9.26528616387798E-5,9.288759713978825E-5,9.486190127177261E-5,9.309120159193056E-5,9.99255189930379E-5,9.335305340485739E-5,9.27512287993826E-5,9.317933686253129E-5,9.265828975028936E-5,9.271304398222707E-5,9.243376608095334E-5,9.24577476643806E-5,9.266585881770545E-5,9.364328727494787E-5,9.31674463804323E-5,9.279908834138143E-5,9.39266945705158E-5,9.283470513858511E-5,9.591914139117866E-5,9.450862245819553E-5,9.248072846915025E-5,9.268511653465177E-5,9.265296984430997E-5,9.526057270215236E-5,9.268649551248949E-5,9.244953952914895E-5,9.346430553096543E-5,9.27103690932369E-5,9.969981282666232E-5,9.263396370255362E-5,9.247965898258002E-5,9.292122221144244E-5,9.384292264110428E-5,9.291507494404849E-5,9.246255003891846E-5,9.267783492536885E-5,9.243488408371637E-5,9.4573635712431E-5,9.323116721925898E-5,9.303257118283784E-5,9.295120999468702E-5,9.329003193055119E-5,9.243151191254799E-5,9.295315867326202E-5,9.44607972004895E-5,9.259715431608798E-5,9.488888563923335E-5,9.28419717847105E-5,9.356859960975846E-5,9.29967494911768E-5,9.240253191124115E-5,9.25170711958048E-5]}}

I got worse.<br /><br />If there is a suggestion that I can make to he producer is to re-direct his life to another field, because making movies is definitely no his cup of tea","finished_norm":["the","titl","should","have","be","the","walker","that","be","onli","he","do","walkbr","br","there","be","noth","on","the","movi","that","be","good","the","descript","of","the","movi","doe","not","realli","compli","with","the","plotbr","br","the","onli","thing","that","i","can","get","from","the","movi","be","that","he","be","a","good","son","but","a","low","life","terribl","personbr","br","i","be","sorri","that","i","expend","my","monei","and","time","on","thi","movi","i","see","peopl","leav","the","theater","in","the","middl","of","the","movi","i","stai","hope","that","it","will","betterwhat","a","mistak","i","get","worsebr","br","if","there","be","a","suggest","that","i","can","make","to","he","produc","be","to","redirect","hi","life","to","anoth","field","becaus","make","movi","be","definit","no","hi","cup","of","tea"],"filtered":["titl","walker","onli","walkbr","br","noth","movi","good","descript","movi","doe","realli","compli","plotbr","br","onli","thing","get","movi","good","son","low","life","terribl","personbr","br","sorri","expend","monei","time","thi","movi","see","peopl","leav","theater","middl","movi","stai","hope","betterwhat","mistak","get","worsebr","br","suggest","make","produc","redirect","hi","life","anoth","field","becaus","make","movi","definit","hi","cup","tea"],"filtered2":["titl","walker","onli","walkbr","noth","good","descript","doe","realli","compli","plotbr","onli","thing","get","good","son","low","life","terribl","personbr","sorri","expend","monei","time","see","peopl","leav","theater","middl","stai","hope","betterwhat","mistak","get","worsebr","suggest","make","produc","redirect","life","anoth","field","becaus","make","definit","cup","tea"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,8,11,13,18,22,23,29,49,73,74,75,126,166,181,217,261,264,365,392,424,434,437,554,593,646,1282,2068,2721,2915,2925,3101,3423,6066,6927],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,2,3,4,8,11,13,18,22,23,29,49,73,74,75,126,166,181,217,261,264,365,392,424,434,437,554,593,646,1282,2068,2721,2915,2925,3101,3423,6066,6927],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6557002054693947,1.357228929984541,1.5932680941439847,0.9418936859054116,1.982619630677639,1.1317941569733974,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3195384777338066,1.6920303308087352,1.8950689206770979,1.9486336368009016,3.948450049740535,2.2391270689902285,2.4423870329693536,2.4442286541160034,2.6113665294700725,2.7085302779237206,2.757740698455715,3.008694896185175,3.0670934723591254,3.212973749990824,3.4101163271295305,3.1952392950510555,3.439602492783994,3.5227672760500357,3.5900195030592035,4.449957298382227,4.944927550358424,5.322690055917252,5.770002273960917,5.3560264761848435,5.501738287366237,5.626901430320244,6.389041482367141,6.660975197850782]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.06319762740499E-4,1.0560282372480834E-4,1.0642378498178642E-4,1.0580886721839111E-4,1.05810600777553E-4,1.0566269870266421E-4,1.0597695437332011E-4,1.056180298413952E-4,1.0585549767481714E-4,0.1115351468605273,0.7164279957912257,1.0544753905502776E-4,1.0741566508036376E-4,1.089479731458268E-4,1.0552443030048852E-4,1.0523280630464263E-4,1.0785770702247207E-4,1.0598688361399729E-4,1.0565805972046255E-4,1.0574563146628768E-4,1.0676878247178385E-4,1.0609188979594122E-4,1.0621269150729555E-4,1.0632712376967333E-4,1.0714312981937582E-4,1.0658280141351994E-4,1.1106333990738192E-4,1.0547888764154415E-4,1.054817094488072E-4,1.0574894676319503E-4,1.0799661587055036E-4,1.0598074257914173E-4,1.1376134934760877E-4,1.0627885076879996E-4,1.0559369666723183E-4,1.0608108118543262E-4,1.0548788914440407E-4,1.0555022472564994E-4,1.0523227760651533E-4,1.052595797143019E-4,1.0549650623572604E-4,1.0660927083587183E-4,0.1638461412969613,1.0564818290990348E-4,1.0693191911114385E-4,1.0568873125981611E-4,1.0920024296981455E-4,1.0759442156689852E-4,1.052857424741858E-4,1.055184304037188E-4,1.0548183263662992E-4,1.084504879176848E-4,1.0552000031680127E-4,1.0525023506892012E-4,1.0640550702349225E-4,1.055471794677024E-4,1.135043915824482E-4,1.0546019487728794E-4,1.052845249049746E-4,1.0578722761038839E-4,1.0683654800050723E-4,1.0578022918355425E-4,1.0526504703249054E-4,1.055101405723945E-4,1.052335504095408E-4,1.0766843664935032E-4,1.0614008804752279E-4,1.0591399411970512E-4,1.0582136754501393E-4,1.0620710325097672E-4,1.0522971132272681E-4,1.0582358604041301E-4,1.0753997435557192E-4,1.0541828881049753E-4,1.0802733653214472E-4,1.0569700405616269E-4,1.0652424180968122E-4,1.0587321250535535E-4,1.0519671870896826E-4,1.0532711726677988E-4]}}
{"value":"This movie is one of those I regret having invested 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back in. The premise is really interesting - essentially it's a zombie flick from the perspective of the undead (let's not split hairs as to whether they're actually dead or not}. Unfortunately, they fail to deliver a compelling story within this framework. The nearly unbearable monotony of the lives of the central characters may add to the realism of the film, but it sucks all the entertainment value right out of it. If they had put a little more effort toward keeping the viewer engaged, it would have been much more likely that they drive home the social commentary.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","be","on","of","that","i","regret","have","invest","minut","of","my","life","that","i","will","never","get","back","in","the","premis","be","realli","interest","essenti","it","a","zombi","flick","from","the","perspect","of","the","undead","let","not","split","hair","a","to","whether","thei","re","actual","dead","or","not","unfortun","thei","fail","to","deliv","a","compel","stori","within","thi","framework","the","nearli","unbear","monotoni","of","the","live","of","the","central","charact","mai","add","to","the","realism","of","the","film","but","it","suck","all","the","entertain","valu","right","out","of","it","if","thei","have","put","a","littl","much","effort","toward","keep","the","viewer","engag","it","would","have","be","much","much","like","that","thei","drive","home","the","social","commentari"],"filtered":["thi","movi","regret","invest","minut","life","never","get","back","premis","realli","interest","essenti","zombi","flick","perspect","undead","let","split","hair","whether","thei","re","actual","dead","unfortun","thei","fail","deliv","compel","stori","within","thi","framework","nearli","unbear","monotoni","live","central","charact","mai","add","realism","film","suck","entertain","valu","right","thei","put","littl","much","effort","toward","keep","viewer","engag","much","much","like","thei","drive","home","social","commentari"],"filtered2":["regret","invest","minut","life","never","get","back","premis","realli","interest","essenti","zombi","flick","perspect","undead","let","split","hair","whether","re","actual","dead","unfortun","fail","deliv","compel","stori","within","framework","nearli","unbear","monotoni","live","central","charact","mai","add","realism","suck","entertain","valu","right","put","littl","effort","toward","keep","viewer","engag","like","drive","home","social","commentari"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,10,13,14,17,42,46,52,59,60,63,68,75,116,121,124,134,159,195,215,227,228,257,268,279,299,302,401,421,451,461,484,517,563,597,611,672,813,943,975,1197,1254,1263,1459,1677,1962,1979,2054,2155,2218,3982],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,10,13,14,17,42,46,52,59,60,63,68,75,116,121,124,134,159,195,215,227,228,257,268,279,299,302,401,421,451,461,484,517,563,597,611,672,813,943,975,1197,1254,1263,1459,1677,1962,1979,2054,2155,2218,3982],"values":[0.6460382945576578,0.7966340470719924,1.1238870241028365,1.1317941569733974,1.1175081997259209,1.2770536940105968,1.6219954307453837,1.655771293751733,1.7122153074726136,1.8693254449200722,1.838176641236591,1.8729627573220065,2.0064197866819473,1.9742250248702675,2.2466628996789315,2.2190595059394194,2.2323930368088845,2.2443961816702407,2.300267965194495,2.51289241584188,2.605934685587711,2.6005321873043625,2.7742700004069256,2.7602659523229094,3.6746621462132825,2.7910771187233068,2.7949961309240425,2.902686292364678,3.0879275592619675,3.2597778161886266,3.216957819005698,3.358217889001879,3.291526514503207,3.4198487640477615,3.459754308221302,3.4986697244709752,3.520060914452293,3.616452760127359,3.8204358137024927,3.9911462095687695,4.086456389373095,4.240607069200353,4.34596758485818,4.390138803171316,4.597282013139085,4.679973728984199,4.838444069955973,4.979216623837056,4.9909126636002465,4.9676558014359795,5.089758498236879,5.878215858601149]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.876269266220815E-5,7.823157741237248E-5,7.883975332909989E-5,7.838421639445632E-5,7.838550063159117E-5,7.827593336612426E-5,7.850873695942835E-5,7.824284224833942E-5,7.841876068061266E-5,0.26787634908087193,0.7259773146258347,7.811654105030935E-5,7.957454755124924E-5,8.070969595746286E-5,7.817350281713931E-5,7.795746498404333E-5,7.990201643128296E-5,7.851609263547265E-5,7.827249676393482E-5,7.833737074713917E-5,7.909533075490946E-5,7.859388221497226E-5,7.868337327307114E-5,7.876814578271548E-5,7.937265083470746E-5,7.895755421595324E-5,8.22767797978856E-5,7.813976438171587E-5,7.814185480340685E-5,7.833982675065785E-5,8.000492142869116E-5,7.851154329837399E-5,8.427549088285097E-5,7.873238468399151E-5,7.822481600120789E-5,7.858587509338309E-5,7.814643278075082E-5,7.819261157292488E-5,7.795707331943613E-5,7.797729898086725E-5,7.81528164040579E-5,7.897716301608513E-5,7.857584686209819E-5,7.826517992862127E-5,7.921618393080695E-5,7.829521853235597E-5,8.08965798452984E-5,7.970697205867292E-5,7.799668060252267E-5,7.816905803647862E-5,7.814194606211897E-5,8.034115416317976E-5,7.817022104303952E-5,7.797037637858455E-5,7.882621284354473E-5,7.819035561683903E-5,8.408513412355396E-5,7.812591660395406E-5,7.799577861565677E-5,7.836818556678594E-5,7.914553210388122E-5,7.836300106554508E-5,7.798134922224362E-5,7.816291685049411E-5,7.79580162240376E-5,7.976180313655773E-5,7.86295879387

{"value":"Yes, this movie make me feel real horror, when i realized that i paid for it and spent more than 1 hour of my life trying to watch it. The bald guy just give me the impression of being a psycho - Junkie actor and the girl is the worst actress i ever seen . Believe me if you appreciate your time avoid this movie, i understand a movie requires money to be created and some movies do not have that money but that is no justification for a stupid plot and bad acting. I'm always supporting independent movies, when it deserves the support, but movies like this makes a bad name for this kind of movies. I'm still traumatized.

{"value":"I caught \"Sorrows Lost\" at the New York Film and Video Festival and I guess I had some high hopes for this film. Sadly, this is just another Visual FX calling card. The story is pretty lame. The bad lighting and camera work, along with the less than great editing and music all make the film seem low quality.<br /><br />Is it really too much to ask that FX shorts have better stories and have the rest of the technical production be on par with the FX!

{"value":"Trite, clichéd dialog and plotting (the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980s fantasy movies), hokey music, and a paint-by-numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans.<br /><br />What saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of Bakshi's work, the rotoscoping, and the fact that Frank Frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him. This is Frazetta...in motion. The violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword & sorcery movie of the period.<br /><br />I like to watch this with the sound off, playing the soundtrack to the first Conan movie

{"value":"this movie begins with an ordinary funeral... and it insists so hard on this ordinary funeral feel that i lost interest within 5 minutes of watching, and started skipping scenes. it seems to me whomever made this movie is afflicted to the extent of becoming trapped in a permanent morbid trance, unable to contemplate anything else but death and destruction. well, i ain't one of the dark

Okay, it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth, and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship. This all is very good, but look carefully: HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS JOB! The scenes are unbalanced, without proper start and and, with a disordered content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say about the subject, so he over-licitates with violence, nakedness and gutter language.

{"value":"Well, i rented this movie and found out it realllllllly sucks. It is about that family with the stepmother and the same stupid fights in the family,then the cool son comes with his stupid camera and he likes to take a photo to damaged building and weird things and weird movie ,and then he asks his father to take him to a side trip and simply agrees, etc etc etc.....

{"value":"This guy has no idea of cinema. Okay, it seems he made a few interestig theater shows in his youth, and about two acceptable movies that had success more of political reasons cause they tricked the communist censorship. This all is very good, but look carefully: HE DOES NOT KNOW HIS JOB! The scenes are unbalanced, without proper start and and, with a disordered content and full of emptiness. He has nothing to say about the subject, so he over-licitates with violence, nakedness and gutter language.

{"value":"drss1942 really took the words right out of my mouth. I loved Segal's early films and feel like the only one who is still faithful to him. I just saw this movie (ok, fell asleep about 90% through, so I didn't see the end). When I woke up and saw I was at the DVD menu, I was thankful I didn't subject myself to any more of that movie and didn't dare find out what happened at the end. There was something strange about the voice of Segal and others. Kinda reminded me of the original Mad Max where the voice were dubbed, but in the same language (Australlian is English, right? :) Anyway, if I had 10 thumbs, they'd all point down right now for this Segal

{"value":"Thanks to the BBC for this show. I used to suffer from an inferiority complex, I hated leaving the house, talking to new people and I had an overwhelming sense that people hated me. However after watching one episode of 4 Non Blondes my fortunes started to change. After episode 2 I started applying for new jobs, wearing fashionable clothes and I actually felt talented. When the series had finished I was running the sales department at work, banging a plethora of women and frequently won the karaoke competition down my local. If you ever have a confidence crisis and don't know where to turn then take a trip down to Poundland and pick up the DVD it's only

{"value":"While the acting and directing could be argued as having some merit - the storyline is a very poor wannabe Vietnam movie with the country name simply changed.<br /><br />At the very least, for a movie to hold some credibility, try and have some semblance of accuracy in equipment, weapons and tactics. Nevermind the gross misrepresentation of the behaviour of the troops as a norm.<br /><br />Aside for the limited use as silly propaganda about the South African Defence Force, it serves little purpose - definitely no entertainment value.<br /><br />Aspiring movie makers - this is how not to make a war movie.

{"value":"This movie was just plain bad. Just about every cop movie cliché is present and accounted for. Bad guy gets away? check. Partner? check. Wacky personality clash with partner? check. Rookie with something to prove? check. Rookie shows up grizzled veteran. check. About the only ones it didn't touch on were idiot shoot themselves in the foot and retirony but I guess they're saving those old chestnuts for Dooley's next outing. Add in the battle of the sexes with Girl Power along with tired old sight gags and banal overdone material like Dooley's prize car getting trashed all the time and you have the recipe for one really bad movie.

{"value":"I was so looking forward to seeing this when it was in production.But it turned out to be the the biggest let down. A far cry from the whimsical world of Dr Seuss. It was vulgar and distasteful I don't think Dr Seuss would have approved.How the Grinch stole Christmas was much better. I understand it had some subtle adult jokes in it but my children have yet to catch on. Whereas The Cat in the Hat screamed vulgarity they caught a lot more than I would have liked.Growing up with Dr Seuss It really bothered me to see how this timeless classic got trashed on the big screen .Lets see what they do with Horton hears a who.I hope this one does Dr Seuss some

{"value":"To overcome the death of his wife, an old man does what anyone in his position would naturally do (at least in a Peter Greenaway movie): he and his son populate their home with eight and a half (one has no legs) women and embark on a sexual odyssey. This being a Greenaway film, there is lots of pretentious and uninteresting blabbering and of course there is unnecessary male nudity. In fact the father and son share a bed sleeping in the nude. Gross. Besides, who wants to see an old guy full frontal? For those who are not into the homo-erotic scene, one of the women likes to do the nasty with horses. There is no story - just a random collection of dull

{"value":"Now, i hired this movie because Brad Dourif was in it. He is an excellent actor, BRILLIANT in everything...except this movie. And i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was, and didn't bother with a good performance. This movie is a unintentional-comedy. Some of the lines just crack me up. And them there are some lines that make no sense, and it seems like Tobe Hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot. Oh! BTW the plot is BAD! But it one of those films that is TAHT BAD that its actually PAINFUL to watch. I recommend this only for BIG Brad Dourif fans, or fans of any of the other actors, because the plot is pathetic.","finished_norm":["now","i","hire","thi","movi","becaus","brad","dourif","be","in","it","he","be","a","excel","actor","brilliant","in","everythingexcept","thi","movi","and","i","think","that","be","onli","becaus","he","realiz","how","stupid","thi","movi","be","and","do","not","bother","with","a","good","perform","thi","movi","be","a","unintentionalcomedi","some","of","the","line","just","crack","me","up","and","them","there","be","some","line","that","make","no","sens","and","it","seem","like","tobe","hooper","just","throw","line","in","without","think","about","the","plot","oh","btw","the","plot","be","bad","but","it","on","of","that","film","that","be","taht","bad","that","it","actual","pain","to","watch","i","recommend","thi","onli","for","big","brad","dourif","fan","or","fan","of","ani","of","the","other","actor","becaus","the","plot","be","pathet"],"filtered":["hire","thi","movi","becaus","brad","dourif","excel","actor","brilliant","everythingexcept","thi","movi","think","onli","becaus","realiz","stupid","thi","movi","bother","good","perform","thi","movi","unintentionalcomedi","line","crack","line","make","sens","seem","like","tobe","hooper","throw","line","without","think","plot","oh","btw","plot","bad","film","taht","bad","actual","pain","watch","recommend","thi","onli","big","brad","dourif","fan","fan","ani","actor","becaus","plot","pathet"],"filtered2":["hire","becaus","brad","dourif","excel","actor","brilliant","everythingexcept","think","onli","becaus","realiz","stupid","bother","good","perform","unintentionalcomedi","line","crack","line","make","sens","seem","like","tobe","hooper","throw","line","without","think","plot","oh","btw","plot","bad","taht","bad","actual","pain","watch","recommend","onli","big","brad","dourif","fan","fan","ani","actor","becaus","plot","pathet"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,7,9,11,12,22,27,32,35,41,52,82,105,107,125,136,140,173,234,298,310,405,459,496,580,601,912,1014,1926,3035,3343,3603,4771,6647],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,7,9,11,12,22,27,32,35,41,52,82,105,107,125,136,140,173,234,298,310,405,459,496,580,601,912,1014,1926,3035,3343,3603,4771,6647],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,2.1367141713444147,1.982619630677639,2.133457220525776,3.893772050208532,1.3002700588679295,4.1133933855221025,1.463169012899134,3.1375198335242067,1.7122153074726136,2.020196584395323,2.1765612129984904,6.431860195918187,2.2242236634876535,2.346825985579986,4.634339551994196,2.4368824319140248,2.673149229007135,2.7819920465008363,2.854312708080462,3.109204957709252,3.2829611516442836,3.293679367864308,3.5039747767006686,3.506637894120152,3.9405024767500145,4.1302590120314875,4.828393734102471,11.209845047202936,5.967828017290836,5.719991853386255,6.1754673820690815,13.897314540605125]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.58718745965704E-5,9.522538813315109E-5,9.596567472379888E-5,0.13688361606313257,9.541274723771757E-5,9.527937928418932E-5,9.556275350805698E-5,9.523909996682094E-5,9.545323218231615E-5,1.0590015051964217E-4,0.6162072681391628,9.508536306157234E-5,9.686008421056326E-5,9.824181459547718E-5,9.515469831639587E-5,9.489173178563592E-5,9.72586873352116E-5,9.557170701672277E-5,9.52751961680082E-5,9.535416236599005E-5,9.627676981322167E-5,9.566639439419337E-5,9.577532509741813E-5,9.587851226813504E-5,9.661433059250494E-5,9.610906484252177E-5,1.0014930734811398E-4,9.51136310681763E-5,9.511617558055185E-5,9.53571518735017E-5,9.738394581322212E-5,9.556616945241309E-5,1.0258218733247893E-4,9.58349829847089E-5,9.52171579782217E-5,9.565664793008798E-5,9.512174800646814E-5,9.517795796098708E-5,9.489125504190312E-5,9.491587421134507E-5,9.512951830878363E-5,9.613293315331323E-5,9.564444132186173E-5,9.52662899372292E-5,9.6423875252772E-5,9.530285365988734E-5,9.846929423149634E-5,9.702127455766941E-5,9.493946599494237E-5,9.5149288020738E-5,9.511628666288675E-5,9.779321651571577E-5,9.515070366074971E-5,9.490744785064694E-5,9.594919291382967E-5,9.517521195610017E-5,1.0235048043243424E-4,9.509677521462245E-5,9.493836807448318E-5,9.539167091762833E-5,9.63378761221926E-5,9.538536021600033E-5,9.492080426414288E-5,9.514181281905711E-5,9.489240276843014E-5,9.708801628583138E-5,9.570985627383168E-5,9.550598026681229E-5,0.23951257852455,9.577028599090395E-5,9.488894094308265E-5,9.542445645771986E-5,9.697217779445355E-5,9.50589871959455E-5,9.741164760017106E-5,9.531031350059295E-5,9.605625980561294E-5,9.546920620227333E-5,9.485919046539776E-5,9.497677494696403E-5]}}
{"value":"Not only was the plot of this film contrived with the ease in which the two psychos are able to kidnap a pregnant woman without breaking a sweat but it was a terrible rip-off of 'Misery'. However, the main reason I gave this film such a low rating was because it absolutely disgusted me.<br /><br />I'm not someone easily shocked by what film-makers dish out and have always had a love for horror flicks but this film went too far purely in terms of violence and torture just for the sake of getting points in the shock factor.<br /><br />I think most people, when watching just the first ten minutes of 'Hide and Seek', will find themselves reaching for the remote.","finished_norm":["not","onli","be","the","plot","of","thi","film","contriv","with","the","eas","in","which","the","two","psycho","be","abl","to","kidnap","a","pregnant","woman","without","break","a","sweat","but","it","be","a","terribl","ripoff","of","miseri","howev","the","main","reason","i","give","thi","film","such","a","low","rate","be","becaus","it","absolut","disgust","mebr","br","i","be","not","someon","easili","shock","by","what","filmmak","dish","out","and","have","alwai","have","a","love","for","horror","flick","but","thi","film","go","too","far","pure","in","term","of","violenc","and","tortur","just","for","the","sake","of","get","point","in","the","shock","factorbr","br","i","think","much","peopl","when","watch","just","the","ten","minut","of","hide","and","seek","will","find","themselv","reach","for","the","remot"],"filtered":["onli","plot","thi","film","contriv","eas","two","psycho","abl","kidnap","pregnant","woman","without","break","sweat","terribl","ripoff","miseri","howev","main","reason","give","thi","film","low","rate","becaus","absolut","disgust","mebr","br","someon","easili","shock","filmmak","dish","alwai","love","horror","flick","thi","film","go","far","pure","term","violenc","tortur","sake","get","point","shock","factorbr","br","think","much","peopl","watch","ten","minut","hide","seek","find","themselv","reach","remot"],"filtered2":["onli","plot","contriv","eas","two","psycho","abl","kidnap","pregnant","woman","without","break","sweat","terribl","ripoff","miseri","howev","main","reason","give","low","rate","becaus","absolut","disgust","mebr","someon","easili","shock","filmmak","dish","alwai","love","horror","flick","go","far","pure","term","violenc","tortur","sake","get","point","shock","factorbr","think","peopl","watch","ten","minut","hide","seek","find","themselv","reach","remot"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,11,12,22,23,30,32,38,47,54,59,66,70,83,95,101,113,125,139,166,179,197,202,217,222,257,323,360,436,452,454,508,545,583,707,725,802,858,883,934,963,1181,1238,1270,1370,1413,1696,1725,1812,3215,3763,3975,4061],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,6,7,11,12,22,23,30,32,38,47,54,59,66,70,83,95,101,113,125,139,166,179,197,202,217,222,257,323,360,436,452,454,508,545,583,707,725,802,858,883,934,963,1181,1238,1270,1370,1413,1696,1725,1812,3215,3763,3975,4061],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.9708269144703846,0.9609497720722932,0.9913098153388195,1.066728610262888,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3364419891718522,1.3711311285073675,1.519311641348122,1.7064694353107215,1.8113893252729412,1.8693254449200722,1.929723173391612,2.094675786251684,2.292318797740072,2.0323326556775485,2.098582041218749,2.1521782565202803,2.2242236634876535,2.2939035841256437,2.4423870329693536,2.507968722980095,2.558331832813986,2.597304642813496,2.6113665294700725,2.5771019354959765,2.7602659523229094,3.0433232530252132,3.028335462059722,3.2070272508030975,3.41740676039221,3.2556198060399626,6.829941411188657,3.442099372982581,3.4986697244709752,3.6375061693251913,3.6466665387238555,3.8883864756110005,3.8767358583910254,3.8614098879127985,3.9405024767500145,4.035401218572811,4.263079925052412,4.291900363587903,4.3521595551061,4.520909034354511,4.484804029712395,4.637773374493822,4.789173020949191,4.869215728622727,5.501738287366237,5.719991853386255,5.907203395474402,5.878215858601149]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.311057002692252E-5,7.261756836137499E-5,7.318210071096443E-5,7.275925375342145E-5,7.276044583187642E-5,7.265874126891879E-5,7.287483854588433E-5,7.262802481672162E-5,7.279131909256487E-5,8.075799501165594E-5,0.8705256979811316,7.25107871719567E-5,7.386416505663407E-5,7.491785360178524E-5,7.256366128153722E-5,7.236312663002694E-5,7.416813430496872E-5,7.288166636817373E-5,7.265555128218099E-5,7.271576981625685E-5,7.341933753788562E-5,7.295387365702001E-5,7.303694270975012E-5,7.311563182376112E-5,7.367675673507962E-5,7.329144803894954E-5,7.637248128122031E-5,7.253234396413414E-5,7.253428437419705E-5,7.271804957347655E-5,7.426365469368115E-5,7.287744349796341E-5,0.05164967917173836,7.308243699224728E-5,7.261129215867394E-5,7.294644113784282E-5,7.253853382938802E-5,7.258139876588124E-5,7.236276307182794E-5,7.238153731108283E-5,7.254445935482453E-5,7.330964968374774E-5,7.293713254667079E-5,7.264875951335635E-5,7.353151811832011E-5,7.267664250424488E-5,7.50913264365333E-5,7.398708659341802E-5,7.239952808005453E-5,7.255953546464645E-5,7.253436908405444E-5,0.03884148941701686,7.256061501220557E-5,7.237511148456713E-5,7.31695319098745E-5,7.257930470040661E-5,0.033427963545868106,7.251948992256254E-5,7.239869082104657E-5,7.274437332070172E-5,7.346593636679041E-5,7.27395608666297E-5,7.238529690138841E-5,7.25538349788861E-5,7

{"value":"This movie was poorly written, poorly acted and very predictable. It was very low-budget and I can understand why it was never released and went straight to video. It wasn't even campy fun, it was just a complete disaster and I wish I could get the 1-1/2 hours back! The colors were horrible along with the plot which has holes so big in it you could drive a mac truck through them. <br /><br />The plot itself had the young bride doing things that she absolutely was not physically capable of doing -- what a stretch! Skip this movie and watch something better in the horror genre. Just about any movie comes to mind that is better than this.<br /><br

{"value":"For a film with so much promise it was disappointing, thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievable.The plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and it's the worst clichéd ending I've seen in a movie for some time. The final scene would have ripped my heart out, if the entire movie hadn't been so painful to begin with. I was numb! From the very first scene - one was left wondering, if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help, or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting I've seen to date. It was a horror in the true sense of the word.","finished_norm":["for","a","film","with","so","much","promis","it","be","disappoint","thinli","plot","and","the","act","rang","between","horrend","and","unbelievableth","plot","have","much","hole","in","it","than","swiss","chees","and","it","the","wrong","clichéd","end","i","have","see","in","a","movi","for","some","time","the","final","scene","would","have","rip","my","heart","out","if","the","entir","movi","have","not","be","so","pain","to","begin","with","i","be","numb","from","the","veri","scene","on","be","leav","wonder","if","the","sister","be","try","to","reach","out","to","her","twin","for","help","or","simpli","scare","her","to","death","which","would","have","be","well","for","the","audienc","and","save","u","from","two","hour","of","the","wrong","act","i","have","see","to","date","it","be","a","horror","in","the","true","sens","of","the","word"],"filtered":["film","much","promis","disappoint","thinli","plot","act","rang","horrend","unbelievableth","plot","much","hole","swiss","chees","wrong","clichéd","end","see","movi","time","final","scene","rip","heart","entir","movi","pain","begin","numb","veri","scene","leav","wonder","sister","try","reach","twin","help","simpli","scare","death","well","audienc","save","u","two","hour","wrong","act","see","date","horror","true","sens","word"],"filtered2":["promis","disappoint","thinli","plot","act","rang","horrend","unbelievableth","plot","hole","swiss","chees","wrong","clichéd","end","see","time","final","scene","rip","heart","entir","pain","begin","numb","veri","scene","leav","wonder","sister","try","reach","twin","help","simpli","scare","death","well","audienc","save","u","two","hour","wrong","act","see","date","horror","true","sens","word"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,15,19,20,21,24,25,32,36,47,74,83,112,147,156,168,173,174,175,185,187,189,198,201,245,258,304,459,516,585,614,623,647,683,810,824,934,1534,1553,1686,1719,1862,6305,7856],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,8,15,19,20,21,24,25,32,36,47,74,83,112,147,156,168,173,174,175,185,187,189,198,201,245,258,304,459,516,585,614,623,647,683,810,824,934,1534,1553,1686,1719,1862,6305,7856],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.9418936859054116,1.2000607798565692,2.62476135602347,1.165345040023057,2.324031090670098,1.3210361566119257,2.559277576165403,2.742262257014735,1.4680183469605717,1.7064694353107215,1.9486336368009016,2.292318797740072,2.2466628996789315,2.2844323215331563,2.3451551414151686,2.4894767118610357,2.4368824319140248,2.456282578459816,2.3791142619576227,2.518833027372001,2.4732161909892554,2.498193474075453,2.5439726117360975,2.561435818751577,2.7502029743242886,2.7061321952397077,2.871119826396843,3.2829611516442836,3.442099372982581,3.7165362186843414,3.553030933689863,3.607563812710113,3.6746621462132825,3.6105180246075443,3.8425769395797067,3.8767358583910254,3.9405024767500145,4.566029469634981,4.589376833631972,4.662879295624898,4.9227044135737135,4.911775343041523,6.600350576034347,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[9.099432662252589E-5,9.038073060537321E-5,9.108335460336156E-5,9.055707401011987E-5,9.055855768582165E-5,9.043197491923452E-5,9.07009322833366E-5,9.0393744840015E-5,9.05969829308437E-5,1.0051240706733497E-4,0.7606912109196106,9.024782940622387E-5,9.19322603884565E-5,9.324369428372762E-5,9.031363718197057E-5,9.006404925546498E-5,9.231058430326087E-5,9.070943027605219E-5,9.042800462198428E-5,9.050295335999046E-5,9.137862251479774E-5,9.079930036765983E-5,9.090268914596594E-5,9.100062659795568E-5,9.169900965580558E-5,9.12194496505526E-5,9.5054142022378E-5,9.027465925842726E-5,9.027707431697462E-5,9.05057907742384E-5,9.24294701695099E-5,9.070417443915938E-5,9.736324755371628E-5,9.095931189695091E-5,9.037291916527202E-5,9.079004976166143E-5,9.028236324186568E-5,9.033571347604498E-5,9.006359676639954E-5,9.008696341855695E-5,9.028973822467296E-5,9.124210364451303E-5,9.077846417307703E-5,9.041955150186028E-5,9.151824386329772E-5,9.045425501982203E-5,9.345960073582323E-5,0.0526408680800691,9.010935495383561E-5,9.030850213884883E-5,9.027717974791885E-5,9.281791894175357E-5,9.030984575719516E-5,9.007896575479131E-5,9.106771131688178E-5,9.03331071760572E-5,9.714332890257816E-5,9.025866095808907E-5,9.010831289083966E-5,9.053855363810409E-5,9.143661999800747E-5,9.053256399778911E-5,9.009164265150652E-5,9.030140724322713E-5,9.006468610154515E-5,9.214859626164114E-5,9.084055109409111E-5,9.064704742003359E-5,9.056777248022821E-5,9.089790640748328E-5,9.006140039895817E-5,9.056967119115224E-5,9.20386511336852E-5,9.02227954310158E-5,9.24557626088751E-5,9.046133533596871E-5,0.17964981741484023,9.061214426147978E-5,9.003316349741612E-5,9.014476578710123E-5]}}
{"value":"My family and I screened Underdog the night before. And as bad as Underdog is ( my four year old loved it), Hot Rod makes it look like Oscar worthy material. The only thing that could have saved this movie, was if Evel himself had come out of retirement to slap Samberg in the face for making this movie. I will admit however, that the soundtrack was good. I wasn't sure if the movie was set in the 80's, but with the majority of the music coming from Europe? Who knows. If I were you, I would take a pass. And just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local TV station. Or if you are dead set on watching this, people under the influence might enjoy it.","finished_norm":["my","famili","and","i","screen","underdog","the","night","befor","and","a","bad","a","underdog","be","my","four","year","old","love","it","hot","rod","make","it","look","like","oscar","worthi","materi","the","onli","thing","that","can","have","save","thi","movi","be","if","evel","himself","have","come","out","of","retir","to","slap","samberg","in","the","face","for","make","thi","movi","i","will","admit","howev","that","the","soundtrack","be","good","i","be","not","sure","if","the","movi","be","set","in","the","but","with","the","major","of","the","music","come","from","europ","who","know","if","i","be","you","i","would","take","a","pass","and","just","stai","at","home","and","watch","the","test","pattern","on","your","local","tv","station","or","if","you","be","dead","set","on","watch","thi","peopl","under","the","influenc","mai","enjoi","it"],"filtered":["famili","screen","underdog","night","befor","bad","underdog","four","year","old","love","hot","rod","make","look","like","oscar","worthi","materi","onli","thing","save","thi","movi","evel","come","retir","slap","samberg","face","make","thi","movi","admit","howev","soundtrack","good","sure","movi","set","major","music","come","europ","know","take","pass","stai","home","watch","test","pattern","local","tv","station","dead","set","watch","thi","peopl","influenc","mai","enjoi"],"filtered2":["famili","screen","underdog","night","befor","bad","underdog","four","year","old","love","hot","rod","make","look","like","oscar","worthi","materi","onli","thing","save","evel","come","retir","slap","samberg","face","make","admit","howev","soundtrack","good","sure","set","major","music","come","europ","know","take","pass","stai","home","watch","test","pattern","local","tv","station","dead","set","watch","peopl","influenc","mai","enjoi"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,7,9,11,16,23,26,29,31,34,46,54,57,67,79,109,113,118,119,172,182,189,192,200,210,228,251,302,365,404,475,487,537,606,666,691,796,979,1259,1306,1337,1491,1777,2422,2773,3516,3591,7729],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,3,7,9,11,16,23,26,29,31,34,46,54,57,67,79,109,113,118,119,172,182,189,192,200,210,228,251,302,365,404,475,487,537,606,666,691,796,979,1259,1306,1337,1491,1777,2422,2773,3516,3591,7729],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6786144649922705,1.9218995441445863,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1966138720291084,1.364847727375781,1.3324924169710188,1.3195384777338066,1.4070669811451506,2.7965700178917925,1.655771293751733,1.8113893252729412,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,1.9469506069506084,4.251382278653714,2.1521782565202803,2.354379525480895,2.1653408989309972,2.5001408943598484,2.7365296724240786,2.498193474075453,2.5318267134339894,2.5308211829319704,2.687151791517189,2.7742700004069256,2.6942272927333892,2.902686292364678,3.008694896185175,3.1419947805322432,3.3721070011625462,3.3220965805878846,3.424750734647968,3.584239140143704,3.6621227969605474,3.5929222627171646,3.850067611308864,4.096025840389245,4.390138803171316,4.499089986959872,4.396611317676934,4.558366596889411,4.798834931860927,5.259176650194926,5.3560264761848435,5.604922523601468,6.1754673820690815,14.071337294584385]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[7.968521619195333E-5,7.914788015028819E-5,7.976317944706321E-5,7.930230694647246E-5,7.930360622548735E-5,7.919275563187273E-5,7.942828598305383E-5,7.915927692786209E-5,7.933725583937497E-5,0.07752245912567521,0.9162592144082652,7.903149640220775E-5,8.050658009106713E-5,8.165502414626239E-5,7.908912534493559E-5,7.887055712622671E-5,8.083788451476854E-5,7.943572781390059E-5,7.918927877780419E-5,7.925491261029697E-5,8.002175037374243E-5,7.951442851915064E-5,7.960496775886962E-5,7.969073318320718E-5,8.030231861952152E-5,7.988236009997423E-5,8.32404627643979E-5,7.90549917414512E-5,7.905710664761739E-5,7.925739738023995E-5,8.094199480719941E-5,7.943112519179635E-5,8.526258414607507E-5,7.96545532255805E-5,7.914103954476543E-5,7.950632761257492E-5,7.906173824542145E-5,7.910845791578182E-5,7.887016087417075E-5,7.889062343263959E-5,7.906819663817212E-5,7.990219857203456E-5,7.949618192365863E-5,7.918187624261788E-5,8.01440190662334E-5,7.921226667940714E-5,8.184409694839263E-5,8.064055564658078E-5,7.891023206535085E-5,7.908462850390715E-5,7.905719897521513E-5,8.128216573372477E-5,7.908580513241116E-5,7.888361974801605E-5,7.974948036590768E-5,7.91061755363666E-5,8.506999779579326E-5,7.904098176886861E-5,7.890931951378637E-5,7.928608835457986E-5,8.007253971588821E-5,7.928084312884848E-5,7.889472111326473E-5,7.907841538807389E-5,7.887111482272782E-5,8.06960289442501E-5,7.95505524531997E-5,7.938109812924855E-5,7.931167577126792E-5,7.96007794367607E-5,7.886823747937353E-5,7.93133385033973E-5,8.059974820

{"value":"I'm shocked that there were people who liked this movie..I saw it at Tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny. I felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience, but honestly the plot to this movie needed MAJOR revision..it didn't even make sense, one second the characters question what exactly it is that they're snorting..the next scene they're hopelessly addicted and figure out how to make it?? Also the ending just took the cake..I'm not going to spoil the magnificent conclusion..but it pretty much blended right in with the rest of the horrible plot/script...see this movie for comedy if you must..","finished_norm":["i","be","shock","that","there","be","peopl","who","like","thi","moviei","see","it","at","tribeca","and","much","of","the","audienc","laugh","through","it","at","scene","that","be","not","mean","to","be","funni","i","feel","bad","becaus","the","lead","actress","be","in","the","audienc","but","honestli","the","plot","to","thi","movi","ne","major","revisionit","do","not","even","make","sens","on","the","charact","question","what","exactli","it","be","that","thei","re","snortingth","next","scene","thei","re","hopelessli","addict","and","figur","out","how","to","make","it","conjur","the","end","just","take","the","cakeim","not","go","to","spoil","the","magnific","conclusionbut","it","pretti","much","blend","right","in","with","the","rest","of","the","horribl","plotscriptse","thi","movi","for","comedi","if","you","must"],"filtered":["shock","peopl","like","thi","moviei","see","tribeca","much","audienc","laugh","scene","mean","funni","feel","bad","becaus","lead","actress","audienc","honestli","plot","thi","movi","ne","major","revisionit","even","make","sens","charact","question","exactli","thei","re","snortingth","next","scene","thei","re","hopelessli","addict","figur","make","conjur","end","take","cakeim","go","spoil","magnific","conclusionbut","pretti","much","blend","right","rest","horribl","plotscriptse","thi","movi","comedi","must"],"filtered2":["shock","peopl","like","moviei","see","tribeca","audienc","laugh","scene","mean","funni","feel","bad","becaus","lead","actress","audienc","honestli","plot","ne","major","revisionit","even","make","sens","charact","question","exactli","re","snortingth","next","scene","re","hopelessli","addict","figur","make","conjur","end","take","cakeim","go","spoil","magnific","conclusionbut","pretti","blend","right","rest","horribl","plotscriptse","comedi","must"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,9,10,19,22,23,24,31,32,39,43,62,68,78,88,110,121,127,133,141,157,168,173,226,230,297,354,378,404,415,462,508,757,1193,2210,3006,3120,3344,5329],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,5,6,9,10,19,22,23,24,31,32,39,43,62,68,78,88,110,121,127,133,141,157,168,173,226,230,297,354,378,404,415,462,508,757,1193,2210,3006,3120,3344,5329],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,0.926017105726131,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,2.62476135602347,1.2979240167361772,1.364847727375781,1.3210361566119257,1.4070669811451506,1.3711311285073675,1.5538940054862738,1.6608112036218214,2.0226120445069267,4.012839573363895,2.0064197866819473,2.0317223413467334,2.1290479736304078,2.2190595059394194,2.4359679371086367,2.3212364753796515,2.2657547357741192,2.3360150694757706,4.978953423722071,2.4368824319140248,2.5940874818617203,2.7121382192999195,2.813490713560207,3.0316467233633775,3.130944944345658,3.1419947805322432,3.1588018988486244,3.2639531875991072,3.4149707055943286,3.7165362186843414,4.240607069200353,5.102830579804232,5.408212229355414,5.463272006538442,5.541743621979936,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.0802672696412186E-4,1.0729827748961565E-4,1.0813241928291661E-4,1.0750762901232668E-4,1.0750939040378797E-4,1.0735911376048476E-4,1.0767841480721235E-4,1.0731372774046622E-4,1.0755500812092046E-4,1.1932641031360448E-4,0.8281215040707365,1.0714049972382957E-4,1.0914022402051453E-4,1.1069713329820655E-4,1.0721862545854924E-4,1.0692231943826285E-4,0.062271238057300136,0.03184283882779407,1.0735440029940495E-4,1.0744337800996581E-4,1.0848295570902044E-4,1.0779519551851154E-4,1.0791793670183344E-4,1.0803420617464955E-4,1.0886331320480194E-4,1.0829398872410896E-4,1.1284646228173002E-4,1.0717235161203011E-4,1.0717521872342025E-4,1.0744674653397849E-4,1.097305019780026E-4,1.0768226383269385E-4,1.1558778827450322E-4,0.06954036716839686,1.0728900389709259E-4,1.0778421337571722E-4,1.071814976340551E-4,1.0724483401331164E-4,1.0692178225188496E-4,1.069495226951232E-4,1.0719025307281331E-4,1.0832088311314448E-4,1.0777045918618496E-4,1.0734436491661214E-4,1.0864871150778947E-4,1.073855642704477E-4,1.109534533152454E-4,1.0932185044316833E-4,1.0697610549822355E-4,1.0721252923341245E-4,1.0717534388902398E-4,1.1019166094270149E-4,1.0721412435145586E-4,1.0694002802142177E-4,1.0811384787192763E-4,1.0724173986373535E-4,1.1532670505137694E-4,1.0715335873536767E-4,1.069748683809337E-4,1.0748564198032939E-4,1.0855180921358333E-4,1.0747853119372394E-4,1.069550777911276E-4,1.0720410630881249E-4,1.0692307548976818E-4,1.0939705383807019E-4,1.0784416759321846E-4,1.0761444372646925E-4,1.0752033003174432E-4,1.0791225872603667E-4,1.0691917476639978E-4,1.0752258414509607E-4,1.0926652908164222E-4,1.0711077986650434E-4,1.0976171585994392E-4,1.073939698865733E-4,1.0823448894559223E-4,1.0757300736313508E-4,1.06885652456093

The jokes are so not funny, I understand that they are supposed to be taking the mickey. BUT do it with style, this movie is screaming 1995 Saturday night live skits.

{"value":"Let me start out by saying that I used to really like Betty Grable, particularly from \"Down Argentine Way\", but by the time she got around to this disaster, she had also got \"round\" and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment. Costarred with Douglas Fairbanks JNr (who must have been fairly desperate) the story was bad, the colours good, and the film far too long. It had some of the old standbys in it like Harry Davenport and Reginald Gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success. The music score was woeful, and I have to say not one tune was memorable in any way....as I was such a fan of Miss Grable, I always wish I had never seen this

{"value":"Evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything. I am not sure how much John Rys-Daves got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a ROTTEN movie. The special effects were worse then effects from the 1950's B movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse. As to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion. The English was terribly accented and I think no one could really even speak English they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character

{"value":"I rented this horrible movie. The worst think I have ever seen. I believe a 1st grade class could have done a better job. The worse film I have ever seen and I have seen some bad ones. Nothing scary except I paid 1.50 to rent it and that was 1.49 too much. The acting is horrible, the characters are worse and the film is just a piece of trash. The slauther house scenes are so low budget that it makes a B movied look like an Oscar candidate. All I can say is if you wnat to waste a good evening and a little money go rent this horrible flick.

{"value":"This is quite possibly the worst Christmas film ever. The plot is virtually non-existent, the acting (Affleck in particular) is poor at best. Ben Affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree. As far as I could gather the plot consisted of Ben Affleck, a millionaire salesman, is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. On doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for Christmas... and that is it.
