{"value":"Chris Kattan is a great sketch actor on Saturday Night Live...but he should probably leave the movie industry alone unless he gets some sort of creative control. He plays an annoyingly peppy character who basically comes off as mildly retarded and on speed. Wanna know the only funny parts? The stuff they showed in the previews. Yes, his rendition of take on me is funny. Nothing else is. ESPECIALLY when you can tell he's trying very hard to be a physical comedian, which he shouldn't have to try at because he is one. And yet, his 'demolishing the vet's office' bit comes off as cringingly bad. This movie made me develop an eye twitch. Avoid it at all costs, and keep watching SNL.","finished_norm":["chri","kattan","be","a","great","sketch","actor","on","saturdai","night","livebut","he","should","probabl","leav","the","movi","industri","alon","unless","he","get","some","sort","of","creativ","control","he","plai","a","annoyingli","peppi","charact","who","basic","come","off","a","mildli","retard","and","on","spe","wanna","know","the","onli","funni","part","the","stuff","thei","show","in","the","preview","ye","hi","rendit","of","take","on","me","be","funni","noth","els","be","especi","when","you","can","tell","he","try","veri","hard","to","be","a","physic","comedian","which","he","should","not","have","to","try","at","becaus","he","be","on","and","yet","hi","demolish","the","vet","offic","bite","come","off","a","cringingli","bad","thi","movi","make","me","develop","a","ey","twitch","avoid","it","at","all","cost","and","keep","watch","snl"],"filtered":["chri","kattan","great","sketch","actor","saturdai","night","livebut","probabl","leav","movi","industri","alon","unless","get","sort","creativ","control","plai","annoyingli","peppi","charact","basic","come","mildli","retard","spe","wanna","know","onli","funni","part","stuff","thei","show","preview","ye","hi","rendit","take","funni","noth","els","especi","tell","try","veri","hard","physic","comedian","try","becaus","yet","hi","demolish","vet","offic","bite","come","cringingli","bad","thi","movi","make","develop","ey","twitch","avoid","cost","keep","watch","snl"],"filtered2":["chri","kattan","great","sketch","actor","saturdai","night","livebut","probabl","leav","industri","alon","unless","get","sort","creativ","control","plai","annoyingli","peppi","charact","basic","come","mildli","retard","spe","wanna","know","onli","funni","part","stuff","show","preview","ye","rendit","take","funni","noth","els","especi","tell","try","veri","hard","physic","comedian","try","becaus","yet","demolish","vet","offic","bite","come","cringingli","bad","make","develop","ey","twitch","avoid","cost","keep","watch","snl"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,9,10,11,15,22,26,28,31,34,36,40,41,49,51,61,62,74,90,134,148,154,171,194,196,209,210,267,269,281,286,320,335,361,457,460,587,824,836,970,1083,1125,1140,1429,1560,1575,1633,1796,1974,2017,2621,2673,3806,4175,5272,5709,5926],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,4,7,9,10,11,15,22,26,28,31,34,36,40,41,49,51,61,62,74,90,134,148,154,171,194,196,209,210,267,269,281,286,320,335,361,457,460,587,824,836,970,1083,1125,1140,1429,1560,1575,1633,1796,1974,2017,2621,2673,3806,4175,5272,5709,5926],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.1238870241028365,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,1.2979240167361772,1.3324924169710188,1.5452294193519092,1.4070669811451506,2.7965700178917925,2.9360366939211433,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,1.8818517047392527,4.045224089013853,1.9486336368009016,2.0477128419653545,2.2443961816702407,2.3018654096236517,2.348499626138016,2.373087554090762,2.5378812223426954,2.478925055209576,2.6026896854443837,2.687151791517189,2.7085302779237206,2.76533567167316,2.832333801361687,2.780700890737216,2.938298364153555,2.908534262247101,3.0399731661399314,3.3243163373261977,3.216957819005698,3.6105180246075443,3.9081109809587793,3.7881170224473255,4.086456389373095,4.191816905030921,4.251780369798478,4.558366596889411,4.535724120139652,4.573751515728891,4.733083554298147,4.828393734102471,4.77960356993304,4.9909126636002465,5.00274712124725,5.408212229355414,5.521540914662417,5.850044981634453,5.878215858601149,6.214688095222362,6.948657270302562,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[1.9506119461623904E-4,1.948883410303087E-4,1.9493646046718607E-4,1.9489727200317517E-4,1.9491571671815218E-4,1.9488726647479062E-4,1.9494787912034502E-4,1.9485827042812383E-4,1.9488838221796726E-4,1.9508977824281095E-4,1.9663775885027984E-4,1.9488870412317792E-4,1.9507327604168838E-4,1.9509359931150222E-4,1.9500497338335578E-4,1.9489803967532115E-4,1.9496509213860974E-4,1.9505684337379862E-4,1.9490810142076955E-4,1.9490738881741262E-4,1.9508273764260608E-4,1.94926916547917E-4,1.9492721155291227E-4,1.9505208401168596E-4,1.9490817172902955E-4,1.9509593116155178E-4,1.9495694674437428E-4,1.9488790424509794E-4,1.9497625809236234E-4,1.9503576765685207E-4,1.949278726959909E-4,1.9503227181974915E-4,1.9512802779626706E-4,1.9530913686235496E-4,1.949566098532893E-4,1.9489792146657047E-4,1.9496819317392074E-4,1.9491771517053726E-4,1.9485847840320728E-4,1.9490804106090233E-4,1.9510337222585774E-4,1.9499634574500076E-4,1.9503271626469332E-4,1.94868176487927E-4,1.949080906210796E-4,1.9489784817751062E-4,1.949638193320436E-4,1.9499762630200034E-4,1.94957974636

Should be child friendly. That is what I would expect. put out by warner brothers and G rated I would expect this to not have cuss words in it. The words don't even fit the movie in most places as it seems added later.

{"value":"The mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80's well with some good performances.<br /><br />However..... <br /><br />The script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where I expect it was intended to be edgy. The characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clichés that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front. The biggest problem is this movie has no real story. It ticks all the right \"arty\" boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was.<br /><br />Very

{"value":"If John Waters had written and directed \"House of 1000 Corpses\" after being struck about the head repeatedly with a heavy object, the result would probably be something like \"The Blood Shed.\" It's mildly entertaining for the first half hour, but then it slides into a sort of featureless glop of constant screaming and people doing things to each others genitalia with electric carving knives, cutlery and pliers. Susan Adriensen (Sno Cakes) is incredibly annoying and Terry West (Elvis Bullion) is almost as bad in whatever it is he's doing in front of the camera.<br /><br />Maybe the best thing about \"The Blood Shed\" is that it won't take most viewers very long to forget about

I think the cinematography was the only thing that didn't totally suck... well, maybe the sound was minimalistically OK. The one good thing is, if they could make this movie, even make some money with it, there may be hope for any screenwriter with a REAL idea. So, you-all take heart!

The acting was totally wooden, the plot completely predictable, the ending totally unrealistic -- I mean who would believe a 30 million dollar judgment for the death of a recovering drug addict with terminal cancer? The lead actor (Victor Garber) seemed so uncomfortable, almost embarrassed in his role -- perhaps he realized how bad the writing was!! I fully realize that the drama offered this season is pretty poor, but they can surely find better writers. Maybe they are outsourcing the writing to India or China!! I'll bet we won't be seeing this one next season!","finished_norm":["i","be","base","thi","on","my","observ","of","on","episod","i","see","last","night","i","do","not","think","i","will","be","watch","again","the","act","be","total","wooden","the","plot","complet","predict","the","end","total","unrealist","i","mean","who","would","believ","a","million","dollar","judgment","for","the","death","of","a","recov","drug","addict","with","termin","cancer","the","lead","actor","victor","garber","seem","so","uncomfort","almost","embarrass","in","hi","role","perhap","he","realiz","how","bad","the","write","be","i","fulli","realiz","that","the","drama","offer","thi","season","be","pretti","poor","but","thei","can","sure","find","well","writer","mayb","thei","be","outsourc","the","write","to","india","or","china","i","will","bet","we","wo","not","be","see","thi","on","next","season"],"filtered":["base","thi","observ","episod","see","last","night","think","watch","act","total","wooden","plot","complet","predict","end","total","unrealist","mean","believ","million","dollar","judgment","death","recov","drug","addict","termin","cancer","lead","actor","victor","garber","seem","uncomfort","almost","embarrass","hi","role","perhap","realiz","bad","write","fulli","realiz","drama","offer","thi","season","pretti","poor","thei","sure","find","well","writer","mayb","thei","outsourc","write","india","china","bet","wo","see","thi","next","season"],"filtered2":["base","observ","see","last","night","think","watch","act","total","wooden","plot","complet","predict","end","total","unrealist","mean","believ","million","dollar","judgment","death","recov","drug","addict","termin","cancer","lead","actor","victor","garber","seem","uncomfort","almost","embarrass","role","perhap","realiz","bad","write","fulli","realiz","drama","offer","season","pretti","poor","sure","find","well","writer","mayb","outsourc","write","india","china","bet","wo","see","next","season"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,9,12,20,21,24,32,35,38,41,65,78,88,91,103,119,128,131,144,146,157,163,184,210,245,287,297,318,334,337,405,406,463,507,556,697,807,817,891,1038,1264,1367,1451,1852,2059,2211,2287,2636,2702,2882,2991,3475,4250],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,7,9,12,20,21,24,32,35,38,41,65,78,88,91,103,119,128,131,144,146,157,163,184,210,245,287,297,318,334,337,405,406,463,507,556,697,807,817,891,1038,1264,1367,1451,1852,2059,2211,2287,2636,2702,2882,2991,3475,4250],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,1.165345040023057,1.162015545335049,1.3210361566119257,1.3711311285073675,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,3.8147700134888347,2.0064197866819473,2.0317223413467334,2.0105926690411424,2.098582041218749,2.1653408989309972,2.3409902041158843,2.2512118082053005,2.2931108769894046,2.326138445979858,2.3360150694757706,2.4000574358028657,4.992499677733764,2.687151791517189,2.7502029743242886,2.841890188081905,2.813490713560207,2.902686292364678,2.942840385588056,2.973659465713028,6.218409915418504,3.121829110937649,3.3467891931782563,3.365138331846453,3.43462735814388,3.7952092507568174,3.900174431363043,8.394243914521228,3.8767358583910254,4.145296889396028,4.327618446189983,4.416284083275639,4.499089986959872,4.838444069955973,4.956227105612356,5.102830579804232,5.649374286172302,5.373120909544144,5.3064295350454715,5.501738287366237,5.626901430320244,5.822646007446338,5.9370563586240825]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0481646893745159E-4,2.046349707097642E-4,2.046854966648004E-4,2.046443483326701E-4,2.0466371549280457E-4,2.0463384241427044E-4,2.046974863802568E-4,2.046033962360692E-4,2.0463501395727332E-4,2.048464820698709E-4,2.0647187928241842E-4,2.046353519613992E-4,2.0482915457133757E-4,2.048504942353785E-4,2.04757436004627E-4,2.0464515439713903E-4,2.0471556024485952E-4,2.0481190008348813E-4,2.0465571934409396E-4,2.0465497110247878E-4,2.0483908935972164E-4,2.0467547544121277E-4,2.0467578519980708E-4,2.0480690269923532E-4,2.046557931685652E-4,2.0485294270440477E-4,2.0470700748843507E-4,2.0463451208033395E-4,2.047272846230703E-4,2.047897703414151E-4,2.046764794075458E-4,2.047860996727677E-4,2.0488664453525887E-4,2.0507681111083873E-4,2.0470665374897103E-4,2.0464503027660874E-4,2.0471881636714308E-4,2.0466581389049795E-4,2.0460361461226804E-4,2.0465565596554809E-4,2.0486075590640674E-4,2.0474837688640198E-4,2.04786566345005E-4,2.0461379771132912E-4,2.046557080042969E-4,2.0464495332226382E-4,2.047142237835145E-4,2.047497214857901E-4,2.047080867869227E-4,2.046756401934991E-4,2.046454593935083E-4,2.050647447058981E-4,2.046969540860501E-4,2.0465566109746847E-4,2.0469585785804552E-4,2.046347214492582E-4,0.9838262975206153,2.0466664788314025E-4,2.0464574668954043E-4,2.0463460463854063E-4,2.0

{"value":"This movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning, but never fleshed out to it's expectations. The director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of the Asian directors), but doesn't know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it. The story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film, never finding a solid, explainable, interesting angle. Basically, the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases. The acting was very good, however. All the actors gave good performances, and Jude Law was outstanding as he is always is. It is too bad he chose to do such a weak film.","finished_norm":["thi","movi","look","a","if","it","mai","be","good","at","the","begin","but","never","flesh","out","to","it","expect","the","director","be","talent","and","have","some","good","camera","angl","and","artist","idea","typic","of","the","asian","director","but","doe","not","know","how","to","creat","or","tell","a","good","stori","to","go","along","with","it","the","stori","be","fragment","and","seem","to","go","off","in","all","sort","of","differ","direct","throughout","the","film","never","find","a","solid","explain","interest","angl","basic","the","movi","never","fit","the","explan","on","the","press","releas","the","act","be","veri","good","howev","all","the","actor","give","good","perform","and","jude","law","be","outstand","a","he","be","alwai","be","it","be","too","bad","he","choos","to","do","such","a","weak","film"],"filtered":["thi","movi","look","mai","good","begin","never","flesh","expect","director","talent","good","camera","angl","artist","idea","typic","asian","director","doe","know","creat","tell","good","stori","go","along","stori","fragment","seem","go","sort","differ","direct","throughout","film","never","find","solid","explain","interest","angl","basic","movi","never","fit","explan","press","releas","act","veri","good","howev","actor","give","good","perform","jude","law","outstand","alwai","bad","choos","weak","film"],"filtered2":["look","mai","good","begin","never","flesh","expect","director","talent","good","camera","angl","artist","idea","typic","asian","director","doe","know","creat","tell","good","stori","go","along","stori","fragment","seem","go","sort","differ","direct","throughout","never","find","solid","explain","interest","angl","basic","never","fit","explan","press","releas","act","veri","good","howev","actor","give","good","perform","jude","law","outstand","alwai","bad","choos","weak"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,9,15,16,17,18,21,26,30,35,38,41,42,46,58,60,90,102,105,113,123,130,147,197,204,231,269,276,286,324,327,362,379,395,438,584,613,676,724,1000,1029,1293,1344,1421,1519,1964,2422,4637,5518],"values":[5.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,6,9,15,16,17,18,21,26,30,35,38,41,42,46,58,60,90,102,105,113,123,130,147,197,204,231,269,276,286,324,327,362,379,395,438,584,613,676,724,1000,1029,1293,1344,1421,1519,1964,2422,4637,5518],"values":[3.3930723249613526,1.9416538289407692,1.0683570856722073,1.2000607798565692,1.1966138720291084,2.5541073880211935,1.2153159934048174,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3364419891718522,1.463169012899134,1.519311641348122,1.5687599167621034,4.865986292236151,1.655771293751733,3.731402629253362,1.838176641236591,2.0477128419653545,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.1521782565202803,2.2619070973220485,2.2642139034199635,2.2844323215331563,2.558331832813986,2.624524614047584,2.7049353070058615,2.76533567167316,2.7884729505849193,2.780700890737216,2.8753661172782943,2.9674191958529437,3.058539100262467,3.1272886331425473,3.153168081130368,3.1797351085150902,3.5146700658174166,3.5364100524538222,3.6105180246075443,3.7987743169213135,4.062925891962901,4.280272325592784,8.819366798488574,4.477736862489302,4.733083554298147,4.550761997504193,4.900964426937307,5.116075806554253,6.255510089742618,6.255510089742618]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875896E-4,2.0127954981638378E-4,2.0132924729208138E-4,2.0128877367343179E-4,2.0130782326822764E-4,2.0127844002166856E-4,2.0134104041092673E-4,2.012484930726172E-4,2.0127959235475898E-4,2.014875930027251E-4,2.0308633840816407E-4,2.012799248165961E-4,2.0147054962498702E-4,2.0149153938033772E-4,2.0140000703507236E-4,2.0128956652077778E-4,2.0135881791649216E-4,2.0145357806076905E-4,2.0129995823319892E-4,2.0129922226057932E-4,2.014803215116129E-4,2.0131939038753896E-4,2.013196950669894E-4,2.0144866261914547E-4,2.0130003084716262E-4,2.0149394770156275E-4,2.0135040540050414E-4,2.0127909870714801E-4,2.0137035004885427E-4,2.014318111823779E-4,2.0132037789173164E-4,2.01428200702066E-4,2.015270969199919E-4,2.017141453144578E-4,2.0135005746134288E-4,2.0128944443546475E-4,2.0136202064780005E-4,2.0130988725827588E-4,2.0124870786807878E-4,2.0129989589387766E-4,2.0150163278967903E-4,2.0139109646015086E-4,2.014286597222301E-4,2.012587239938057E-4,2.012999470793417E-4,2.012893687429482E-4,2.0135750336924276E-4,2.0139241901200302E-4,2.0135146700162227E-4,2.0131955243836493E-4,2.012898665160899E-4,2.0170227676361368E-4,2.013405168448035E-4,2.012999009416494E-4,2.013394385917635E-4,2.012793046430282E-4,0.9840914994019674,2.0131070757585406E-4,2.012901491012991E-4,2.0127918974766813E-4,2.0144021792777863E-4,2.0135935477464618E-4,2.0127910560768184E-4,2.0125864199645052E-4,2.0123840321685917E-4,2.0142035458908873E-4,2.0128896612560455E-4,2.0138046460285535E-

{"value":"I really didn't like this movie because it didn't really bring across the messages and ideas L'Engle brought out in her novel. We had read the novel in our English class and i absolutely loved it, i'm afraid i can't say the same for the film. There were some serious differences between the novel and the adapted version and it just didn't do any credit to the imaginative genius that is Madeleine L'Engle! This is the reason i gave it such a poor rating. Don't see this movie if you are a big fan of L'Engle's texts because you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you are watching the movie for entertainment purposes (or educational as was my case) then it is an alright

{"value":"Come on, let's get real. The Knights of Christ, Ordo Templi, or the Knights Templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early 12th century. The story is so laughable that it's pathetic. Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored. And besides, if you wanted to have a real-life Templar, why not just use the Knights of Christ, who are still in existence in Portugal. At least they should have taken history into account. The only redeeming quality I could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or Gothic period pieces. The acting was bad, the storyline appalling, the action horrible, and the props were okay.","finished_norm":["come","on","let","get","real","the","knight","of","christ","ordo","templi","or","the","knight","templar","a","thei","be","much","commonli","call","do","not","even","exist","until","the","earli","th","centuri","the","stori","be","so","laughabl","that","it","pathet","dolph","lundgren","just","look","posit","bore","and","besid","if","you","want","to","have","a","reallif","templar","why","not","just","us","the","knight","of","christ","who","be","still","in","exist","in","portug","at","littl","thei","should","have","take","histori","into","account","the","onli","redeem","qualiti","i","can","find","in","thi","movi","be","that","the","artifact","look","authent","enough","to","pass","for","mediev","or","gothic","period","piec","the","act","be","bad","the","storylin","appal","the","action","horribl","and","the","prop","be","okai"],"filtered":["come","let","get","real","knight","christ","ordo","templi","knight","templar","thei","much","commonli","call","even","exist","earli","th","centuri","stori","laughabl","pathet","dolph","lundgren","look","posit","bore","besid","want","reallif","templar","us","knight","christ","still","exist","portug","littl","thei","take","histori","account","onli","redeem","qualiti","find","thi","movi","artifact","look","authent","enough","pass","mediev","gothic","period","piec","act","bad","storylin","appal","action","horribl","prop","okai"],"filtered2":["come","let","get","real","knight","christ","ordo","templi","knight","templar","commonli","call","even","exist","earli","th","centuri","stori","laughabl","pathet","dolph","lundgren","look","posit","bore","besid","want","reallif","templar","us","knight","christ","still","exist","portug","littl","take","histori","account","onli","redeem","qualiti","find","artifact","look","authent","enough","pass","mediev","gothic","period","piec","act","bad","storylin","appal","action","horribl","prop","okai"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,9,11,14,16,17,21,31,34,37,38,56,64,80,93,108,124,129,142,191,218,230,266,319,487,499,509,515,528,552,602,634,743,853,972,1163,1503,1561,1931,2056,2325,2389,2703,2813,3268,3967,5207,6536,7321],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[4,5,9,11,14,16,17,21,31,34,37,38,56,64,80,93,108,124,129,142,191,218,230,266,319,487,499,509,515,528,552,602,634,743,853,972,1163,1503,1561,1931,2056,2325,2389,2703,2813,3268,3967,5207,6536,7321],"values":[0.7966340470719924,0.926017105726131,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,1.1175081997259209,2.393227744058217,1.2770536940105968,1.162015545335049,1.4070669811451506,1.3982850089458962,1.4876543214774305,1.519311641348122,1.8610609350701788,1.883428577602134,1.9951803900462557,2.035389827120098,2.138507503627933,2.2323930368088845,2.4106958340079214,2.2844323215331563,2.5460113484259455,2.5940874818617203,2.7121382192999195,2.747702973022204,2.9056060024680126,3.3220965805878846,3.3814747511661465,3.360519385990158,3.3956930001684253,6.839697528095523,3.424750734647968,3.506637894120152,3.5119855004467477,3.7568101178222815,3.8962296530720266,3.9911462095687695,4.2860694432771105,4.597282013139085,4.550761997504193,10.286208957884345,4.933754249760298,6.255510089742618,5.170884043049248,16.56462274398725,5.878215858601149,5.649374286172302,5.822646007446338,6.2980697041614135,6.660975197850782,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1944977597805374E-4,2.1925531043720617E-4,2.1930944626706052E-4,2.192653580532821E-4,2.1928610891855618E-4,2.1925410152956985E-4,2.193222925991187E-4,2.1922148009526668E-4,2.192553567745746E-4,2.1948193342720803E-4,2.2122345868647727E-4,2.1925571892772612E-4,2.1946336794909424E-4,2.194862322456888E-4,2.1938652538130787E-4,2.1926622170779212E-4,2.1934165776813414E-4,2.19444880697982E-4,2.192775414774108E-4,2.1927673977696318E-4,2.194740125378648E-4,2.1929870906764126E-4,2.192990409572324E-4,2.1943952627086758E-4,2.1927762057634146E-4,2.1948885564790878E-4,2.1933249395190846E-4,2.1925481904056096E-4,2.193542198056753E-4,2.1942116987548038E-4,2.1929978476330198E-4,2.1941723695242715E-4,2.1952496533805897E-4,2.197287185451424E-4,2.193321149391926E-4,2.1926608871935274E-4,2.1934514652716504E-4,2.1928835723826462E-4,2.192217140735603E-4,2.1927747357072455E-4,2.194972270715443E-4,2.1937681902578206E-4,2.1941773696650544E-4,2.192326247137999E-4,2.1927752932743118E-4,2.192660062669316E-4,2.1934022582203972E-4,2.193782596913498E-4,2.1933365036190105E-4,2.192988855908111E-4,2.1926654849491653E-4,2.1971579004444704E-4,2.1932172227464712E-4,2.1927747906929986E-4,2.193205477255922E-4,2.1925504336804672E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.192892508163029E-4,2.1926685631708638E-4,2.1925491821167656E-4,2.1943032740576245E-4,2.193422425717137E-4,2.1925482655736376E-4,2.1923253539347118E-4,2.1921048914035592E-4,2.1940

{"value":"This film is about a man's life going wrong. His business is failing, and he cannot impregnate his wife despite multiple attempts.<br /><br />The plot is complete chaos. It simply does not make sense. In fact, nothing in the film makes sense. The story is so poorly told that I simply could not understand it. It is a shame, because the sets and costumes are done well, and are visually stimulating enough. The shots are well composed throughout the film. However, these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling. I am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film. It is such a waste of their talents.

{"value":"Guy Ritchie's noble effort is beat up, knocked down, raped, kicked around, shot, stabbed, spit upon, punched, sodomized, and abused and left for dead by Madonna's dreadful performance. Her acting was very reminiscent of a graduate from the Al Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking. Guy Ritchie did do a somewhat noble attempt to remake this, and if you exclude ALL of the scenes that his wife was in, it's a fair movie at best. I think that the best acting job ever, had to be Guy comforting his wife that her performance was good enough not to re-shoot. If you have an opportunity of watching Swept Away or clipping your toenails for 89 minutes...go for the extended pedicure.","finished_norm":["gui","ritchi","nobl","effort","be","beat","up","knock","down","rape","kick","around","shoot","stab","spit","upon","punch","sodom","and","abus","and","leav","for","dead","by","madonna","dread","perform","her","act","be","veri","reminisc","of","a","graduat","from","the","al","gore","school","of","dramat","and","public","speak","gui","ritchi","do","do","a","somewhat","nobl","attempt","to","remak","thi","and","if","you","exclud","all","of","the","scene","that","hi","wife","be","in","it","a","fair","movi","at","well","i","think","that","the","well","act","job","ever","have","to","be","gui","comfort","hi","wife","that","her","perform","be","good","enough","not","to","reshoot","if","you","have","a","opportun","of","watch","sweep","awai","or","clip","your","toenail","for","minutesgo","for","the","extend","pedicur"],"filtered":["gui","ritchi","nobl","effort","beat","knock","rape","kick","around","shoot","stab","spit","upon","punch","sodom","abus","leav","dead","madonna","dread","perform","act","veri","reminisc","graduat","al","gore","school","dramat","public","speak","gui","ritchi","somewhat","nobl","attempt","remak","thi","exclud","scene","hi","wife","fair","movi","well","think","well","act","job","ever","gui","comfort","hi","wife","perform","good","enough","reshoot","opportun","watch","sweep","awai","clip","toenail","minutesgo","extend","pedicur"],"filtered2":["gui","ritchi","nobl","effort","beat","knock","rape","kick","around","shoot","stab","spit","upon","punch","sodom","abus","leav","dead","madonna","dread","perform","act","veri","reminisc","graduat","al","gore","school","dramat","public","speak","gui","ritchi","somewhat","nobl","attempt","remak","exclud","scene","wife","fair","well","think","well","act","job","ever","gui","comfort","wife","perform","good","enough","reshoot","opportun","watch","sweep","awai","clip","toenail","minutesgo","extend","pedicur"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,12,15,19,20,21,44,55,74,93,98,105,117,155,177,228,263,289,296,344,358,401,483,596,630,678,746,756,780,869,877,993,995,1184,1317,1410,1542,1563,1587,2214,2421,2431,2458,3011,3198,3233,3239,3621,6778,8305,8565],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[3,7,12,15,19,20,21,44,55,74,93,98,105,117,155,177,228,263,289,296,344,358,401,483,596,630,678,746,756,780,869,877,993,995,1184,1317,1410,1542,1563,1587,2214,2421,2431,2458,3011,3198,3233,3239,3621,6778,8305,8565],"values":[0.6786144649922705,0.9609497720722932,1.066728610262888,1.2000607798565692,1.312380678011735,2.330690080046114,2.324031090670098,1.604729392502474,5.86109936677661,1.9486336368009016,2.035389827120098,2.0881990796736947,4.353122425996981,2.2797301185117202,2.3074766467914385,2.458149992634611,2.7742700004069256,5.805372584729356,2.8282659991423613,2.9504565686333644,2.983093497946387,3.2030824725120812,3.0879275592619675,3.613480989738201,3.485528930909917,3.558633189238533,3.6715125373103863,4.00861390260916,3.7636829971100436,3.7775721092707104,3.9161110236258554,3.865219416329466,4.026392148630444,4.030886538218284,4.3773181147422555,4.646072177308517,4.443131333311827,4.597282013139085,4.74221603786142,4.706176101378222,5.00274712124725,5.102830579804232,5.129498826886393,5.129498826886393,6.255510089742618,5.501738287366237,5.521540914662417,11.209845047202936,12.350934764138163,6.660975197850782,6.948657270302562,7.0356686472921925]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875901E-4,2.0127954981638384E-4,2.0132924729208143E-4,2.0128877367343184E-4,2.013078232682277E-4,2.0127844002166862E-4,2.0134104041092678E-4,2.0124849307261722E-4,2.0127959235475903E-4,2.0148759300272516E-4,2.0308633840816412E-4,2.0127992481659612E-4,2.0147054962498708E-4,2.0149153938033774E-4,2.014000070350724E-4,2.0128956652077783E-4,2.013588179164922E-4,2.0145357806076908E-4,2.0129995823319898E-4,2.0129922226057935E-4,2.0148032151161296E-4,2.01319390387539E-4,2.0131969506698947E-4,2.014486626191455E-4,2.0130003084716267E-4,2.0149394770156278E-4,2.013504054005042E-4,2.0127909870714804E-4,2.0137035004885433E-4,2.0143181118237796E-4,2.013203778917317E-4,2.0142820070206602E-4,2.0152709691999195E-4,2.0171414531445784E-4,2.0135005746134294E-4,2.012894444354648E-4,2.0136202064780008E-4,2.013098872582759E-4,2.012487078680788E-4,2.012998958938777E-4,2.015016327896791E-4,2.013910964601509E-4,2.0142865972223013E-4,2.0125872399380572E-4,2.0129994707934176E-4,2.0128936874294826E-4,2.0135750336924282E-4,2.0139241901200307E-4,2.0135146700162233E-4,2.0131955243836498E-4,2.0128986651608995E-4,2.0170227676361374E-4,2.0134051684480352E-4,2.0129990094164946E-4,2.0133943859176353E-4,2.0127930464302826E-4,0.9840914994019674,2.0131070757585412E-4,2.0129014910129914E-4,2.012791897476682E-4,2.0144021792777868E-4,2.0135935477464623E-4

{"value":"I saw this movie in the middle of the night, when I was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch. It's one of those films where you stop to see what it is - just for a moment! - but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can't turn it off, no matter how bad it is. One of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it's good and so bad it's, well, just plain BAD, it's worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it's both! Great middle-of-the-night fare, if only for the fabulous tennis drag. Don't even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that Chad Lowe is so obviously male, because logic does not apply.","finished_norm":["i","see","thi","movi","in","the","middl","of","the","night","when","i","be","flip","through","the","channel","and","there","be","noth","els","on","to","watch","it","on","of","that","film","where","you","stop","to","see","what","it","be","just","for","a","moment","but","realiz","after","twenti","minut","or","so","that","you","just","ca","not","turn","it","off","no","matt","how","bad","it","be","on","of","that","movi","that","be","somewher","in","between","be","so","bad","it","good","and","so","bad","it","good","just","plain","bad","it","worth","see","just","to","experi","the","confus","of","realiz","that","it","both","great","middleofthenight","fare","if","onli","for","the","fabul","tenni","drag","do","not","even","bother","ask","yourself","why","nobodi","can","tell","that","chad","lowe","be","so","obvious","male","becaus","logic","doe","not","appli"],"filtered":["see","thi","movi","middl","night","flip","channel","noth","els","watch","film","stop","see","moment","realiz","twenti","minut","ca","turn","matt","bad","movi","somewher","bad","good","bad","good","plain","bad","worth","see","experi","confus","realiz","great","middleofthenight","fare","onli","fabul","tenni","drag","even","bother","ask","nobodi","tell","chad","lowe","obvious","male","becaus","logic","doe","appli"],"filtered2":["see","middl","night","flip","channel","noth","els","watch","stop","see","moment","realiz","twenti","minut","ca","turn","matt","bad","somewher","bad","good","bad","good","plain","bad","worth","see","experi","confus","realiz","great","middleofthenight","fare","onli","fabul","tenni","drag","even","bother","ask","nobodi","tell","chad","lowe","obvious","male","becaus","logic","doe","appli"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,9,11,18,22,49,51,59,81,90,96,188,196,210,219,306,315,333,341,405,408,427,496,554,586,649,728,764,804,866,973,1574,1776,2352,2878,3500,4271,6980,7769],"values":[3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,5,7,9,11,18,22,49,51,59,81,90,96,188,196,210,219,306,315,333,341,405,408,427,496,554,586,649,728,764,804,866,973,1574,1776,2352,2878,3500,4271,6980,7769],"values":[1.967100616408184,1.357228929984541,0.926017105726131,0.9609497720722932,4.273428342688829,0.9913098153388195,1.2153159934048174,1.2979240167361772,1.6920303308087352,1.7139899308309823,1.8693254449200722,1.949757232424728,2.0477128419653545,2.0390708128715254,2.5378812223426954,2.478925055209576,2.687151791517189,2.5792094178355414,2.8739486825973213,2.854312708080462,2.948928684455311,2.933776879434709,6.218409915418504,3.130944944345658,3.233054746047873,3.293679367864308,3.439602492783994,3.4572130107926293,3.6375061693251913,3.7740817043309423,3.7465885637507435,3.7740817043309423,3.8962296530720266,4.072271754381138,4.573751515728891,4.760735085628657,5.089758498236879,5.426230734858092,5.626901430320244,6.437831646536572,6.794506590475304,6.948657270302562]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815707E-4,2.4557311712357507E-4,2.4563375102320054E-4,2.455843707821273E-4,2.456076124297672E-4,2.455717631074923E-4,2.456481393351682E-4,2.4553522603438377E-4,2.455731690229429E-4,2.4582694228272693E-4,2.4777750751927874E-4,2.4557357464631465E-4,2.458061483401666E-4,2.458317570999926E-4,2.457200821515691E-4,2.4558533810341916E-4,2.4566982895768755E-4,2.4578544201440586E-4,2.455980166155375E-4,2.455971186848213E-4,2.4581807062765723E-4,2.456217250087551E-4,2.4562209673594963E-4,2.4577944488095315E-4,2.455981052089263E-4,2.4583469539626163E-4,2.4565956518386695E-4,2.4557256674326424E-4,2.4568389885049996E-4,2.457588851178834E-4,2.4562292982306926E-4,2.45754480115461E-4,2.4587513942998134E-4,2.461033496844451E-4,2.4565914067723187E-4,2.4558518915201847E-4,2.4567373648188114E-4,2.4561013062135857E-4,2.4553548809772355E-4,2.455979405578284E-4,2.4584407166447074E-4,2.457092107159919E-4,2.457550401475787E-4,2.455477083715591E-4,2.45598003007163E-4,2.455850968026107E-4,2.4566822513123857E-4,2.4571082430853615E-4,2.456608604008721E-4,2.456219227204774E-4,2.4558570411568415E-4,2.4608886934091695E-4,2.45647500553111E-4,2.455979467164125E-4,2.4564618501976283E-4,2.455728179973836E-4,0.9805906755843552,2.4561113145798053E-4,2.4558604888657985E-4,2.4557267781815653E-4,2.4576914185124154E-4,2.4567048395681914E-4,2.4557257516232917E-4,2.4554760832987024E-4,2.455229158054903E-4,2.4574490738726835E-4,2.455846055853152E-4,2.456962392127306E-4,2.457683448302728E-4,2.456568445147524E-4,2.455982720027571E-4,2.455479302264223E-4,2.4561074592378666E-4,2.455477979712659E-4,2.455606839225923E-4,2.4554793717604075E-4,2.4570733210020195E-4,2.4563420173500804E-4,2.4557290293850733E-4,2.4559669127792563E-4]}}
{"value":"If you go see this movie you'll be holding a grudge against the movie theatre, the director, the producer, the actors and the person that told you to go see it! Shame on you, Sarah Michelle Geller, for putting your name and face to this poor excuse of a movie. It may have been more scary if the Japanese actors would have just spoken in Japanese instead of attempting to 'act' in English. I wanted to boo when the movie ended...a true disappointment after all of the hype on TV and movie trailers promoting this lame money maker. Sarah Michelle really didn't have to act at all to make this movie...she just practiced her frowning skills.

{"value":"I am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie! Jack Frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by A-pix entertainment, and without exception, everything this company deals with is pure crap! First, and this is very important, never ever watch this movie sober! Why would you? Unlike many other entertaingly bad movies, this one I feel was made intentionally bad. I just can't get over how fake the snowman is, which is why its always shown only briefly, the way it moves is the best! This movie is Waaaaaaaaaaay better than the Michael Keaton piece of crap, becuz that was made too be a good movie, and that version is as bad as this.","finished_norm":["i","be","so","happi","and","surpris","that","there","be","so","much","interest","in","thi","movi","jack","frost","be","my","introduct","into","the","film","produc","and","distribut","by","apix","entertain","and","without","except","everyth","thi","compani","deal","with","be","pure","crap","and","thi","be","veri","import","never","ever","watch","thi","movi","sober","why","would","you","unlik","mani","other","entertaingli","bad","movi","thi","on","i","feel","be","make","intention","bad","i","just","ca","not","get","over","how","fake","the","snowman","be","which","be","why","it","alwai","show","onli","briefli","the","wai","it","move","be","the","well","thi","movi","be","waaaaaaaaaaai","well","than","the","michael","keaton","piec","of","crap","becuz","that","be","make","too","be","a","good","movi","and","that","version","be","a","bad","a","thi"],"filtered":["happi","surpris","much","interest","thi","movi","jack","frost","introduct","film","produc","distribut","apix","entertain","without","except","everyth","thi","compani","deal","pure","crap","thi","veri","import","never","ever","watch","thi","movi","sober","unlik","mani","entertaingli","bad","movi","thi","feel","make","intention","bad","ca","get","fake","snowman","alwai","show","onli","briefli","wai","move","well","thi","movi","waaaaaaaaaaai","well","michael","keaton","piec","crap","becuz","make","good","movi","version","bad","thi"],"filtered2":["happi","surpris","interest","jack","frost","introduct","produc","distribut","apix","entertain","without","except","everyth","compani","deal","pure","crap","veri","import","never","ever","watch","sober","unlik","mani","entertaingli","bad","feel","make","intention","bad","ca","get","fake","snowman","alwai","show","onli","briefli","wai","move","well","waaaaaaaaaaai","well","michael","keaton","piec","crap","becuz","make","good","version","bad"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,7,9,11,15,20,28,33,42,43,44,50,60,81,125,193,195,197,218,220,232,261,275,313,326,466,468,600,605,615,639,726,777,882,1274,2288,2470,2728,3210,5095,5789,6161],"values":[2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,3,4,7,9,11,15,20,28,33,42,43,44,50,60,81,125,193,195,197,218,220,232,261,275,313,326,466,468,600,605,615,639,726,777,882,1274,2288,2470,2728,3210,5095,5789,6161],"values":[1.2399534312410465,0.6786144649922705,0.7966340470719924,0.9609497720722932,3.205071257016622,0.9913098153388195,1.2000607798565692,2.330690080046114,1.5452294193519092,1.4018535447685214,1.6219954307453837,1.6608112036218214,1.604729392502474,1.717994385570355,1.838176641236591,1.949757232424728,2.2242236634876535,2.517840471459249,2.51289241584188,2.558331832813986,2.5940874818617203,2.8336934208777267,2.6102777977348763,2.7085302779237206,2.7832848715031413,5.814138121039546,2.942840385588056,3.4446025032006995,3.304513710030018,3.558633189238533,3.5474598886404074,3.5013187326425523,3.616452760127359,3.6466665387238555,4.086456389373095,3.9612932464190886,5.243909178064138,5.089758498236879,5.1994574154933035,5.290429193699031,5.482320201509136,6.437831646536572,6.725513718988353,6.600350576034347]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.4579092488815675E-4,2.4557311712357474E-4,2.4563375102320027E-4,2.45584370782127E-4,2.4560761242976696E-4,2.45571763107492E-4,2.4564813933516786E-4,2.455352260343835E-4,2.455731690229426E-4,2.458269422827266E-4,2.4777750751927847E-4,2.455735746463143E-4,2.4580614834016627E-4,2.4583175709999225E-4,2.457200821515688E-4,2.4558533810341884E-4,2.456698289576872E-4,2.4578544201440554E-4,2.4559801661553715E-4,2.45597118684821E-4,2.458180706276569E-4,2.4562172500875476E-4,2.456220967359493E-4,2.4577944488095283E-4,2.4559810520892596E-4,2.458346953962613E-4,2.456595651838666E-4,2.455725667432639E-4,2.4568389885049963E-4,2.4575888511788307E-4,2.4562292982306894E-4,2.457544801154607E-4,2.45875139429981E-4,2.4610334968444477E-4,2.4565914067723154E-4,2.4558518915201815E-4,2.456737364818808E-4,2.4561013062135824E-4,2.455354880977232E-4,2.455979405578281E-4,2.458440716644704E-4,2.4570921071599157E-4,2.4575504014757836E-4,2.455477083715588E-4,2.455980030071627E-4,2.455850968026104E-4,2.4566822513123824E-4,2.457108243085358E-4,2.4566086040087184E-4,2.4562192272047713E-4,2.455857041156838E-4,2.460888693409167E-4,2.4564750055311067E-4,2.4559794671641226E-4,2.4564618501976256E-4,2.4557281799738326E-4,0.9805906755843553,2.4561113145798026E-4,2.455860488865795E-4,2.455726778181562E-4,2.457691418512412E-4,2.456704839568188E-4,2.4557257516232884E-4,2.455476083298699E-4,2.4552291580548995E-4,2.457449073872681E-4,2.455846055853149E-4,2.456962392127303E-4,2.457683448302725E-4,2.4565684451475215E-4,2.455982720027568E-4,2.4554793022642197E-4,2.4561074592378634E-4,2.455477979712656E-4,2.45560683922592E-4,2.455479371760404E-4,2.45707332100201

{"value":"Pointless boring film with charismatic Mercurio completely wasted. Released for a minute on a Thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Sydney except me and four others BACK OF BEYOND is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee. Local actors like John Polson and Terry Serio deserve better (well Polson has morphed into a Director of lame thrillers like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK) and Terry Serio seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug roles. But Paul Mercurio should have become one of Australia's greatest exports on screen. Roles like this are major disappointments and films like this are just a waste of talent and

{"value":"I simply give this a three because it fulfilled what my buddies and I hoped it would do: entertain. <br /><br />I wasn't stupid enough to rent this thinking it would be a zombie film up there with the likes of Romero or Fulci, but what I rented it for was a laugh. <br /><br />If you are looking for a film for amusement, or a film to make you shake your head in embarrassment, go for it. This is perfect for junior- \"Mystery Science Theater\" fans, but the only downside is that it is so bad, it makes fun of itself. <br /><br />I, personally, think it is a shame to relate this to any other Hollywood title that we may know, because when a film sucks like this, it has its own genre.","finished_norm":["i","simpli","give","thi","a","three","becaus","it","fulfil","what","my","buddi","and","i","hope","it","would","do","entertain","br","br","i","be","not","stupid","enough","to","rend","thi","think","it","would","be","a","zombi","film","up","there","with","the","like","of","romero","or","fulci","but","what","i","rent","it","for","be","a","laugh","br","br","if","you","be","look","for","a","film","for","amus","or","a","film","to","make","you","shake","your","head","in","embarrass","go","for","it","thi","be","perfect","for","junior","mysteri","scienc","theater","fan","but","the","onli","downsid","be","that","it","be","so","bad","it","make","fun","of","itself","br","br","i","person","think","it","be","a","shame","to","relat","thi","to","ani","other","hollywood","titl","that","we","mai","know","becaus","when","a","film","suck","like","thi","it","have","it","own","genr"],"filtered":["simpli","give","thi","three","becaus","fulfil","buddi","hope","entertain","br","br","stupid","enough","rend","thi","think","zombi","film","like","romero","fulci","rent","laugh","br","br","look","film","amus","film","make","shake","head","embarrass","go","thi","perfect","junior","mysteri","scienc","theater","fan","onli","downsid","bad","make","fun","br","br","person","think","shame","relat","thi","ani","hollywood","titl","mai","know","becaus","film","suck","like","thi","genr"],"filtered2":["simpli","give","three","becaus","fulfil","buddi","hope","entertain","stupid","enough","rend","think","zombi","like","romero","fulci","rent","laugh","look","amus","make","shake","head","embarrass","go","perfect","junior","mysteri","scienc","theater","fan","onli","downsid","bad","make","fun","person","think","shame","relat","ani","hollywood","titl","mai","know","becaus","suck","like","genr"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,9,11,12,16,22,26,27,30,46,93,133,136,140,153,181,195,201,208,224,259,264,268,300,403,421,424,467,533,556,574,661,677,708,903,910,1302,1642,2069,2446,3256,3459],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,6,9,11,12,16,22,26,27,30,46,93,133,136,140,153,181,195,201,208,224,259,264,268,300,403,421,424,467,533,556,574,661,677,708,903,910,1302,1642,2069,2446,3256,3459],"values":[1.2399534312410465,1.2920765891153156,0.9708269144703846,1.0683570856722073,0.9913098153388195,2.133457220525776,1.1966138720291084,2.5958480334723544,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.3364419891718522,1.655771293751733,2.035389827120098,2.3212364753796515,2.346825985579986,2.317169775997098,2.3409902041158843,2.4442286541160034,2.51289241584188,2.561435818751577,2.6289494000279396,2.689504733779216,2.7464553122240485,2.757740698455715,3.6746621462132825,2.932274249550174,3.189397019426827,3.2597778161886266,3.212973749990824,3.342254038012865,3.424750734647968,3.43462735814388,3.5039747767006686,3.5727776966246974,3.6559115968679063,3.6683728173057184,3.948766986599908,4.096025840389245,4.4919214974812585,4.671389985292807,5.770002273960917,5.482320201509136,5.541743621979936,5.719991853386255]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.508084609727828E-4,2.5058620691581306E-4,2.506480785860335E-4,2.5059769030472617E-4,2.506214064035923E-4,2.5058482525906555E-4,2.506627606186685E-4,2.5054754232407123E-4,2.505862598746462E-4,2.5084521362060507E-4,2.528355973798668E-4,2.505866737783477E-4,2.5082399519387306E-4,2.508501267267696E-4,2.5073617206405755E-4,2.50598677372758E-4,2.506848930096249E-4,2.508028661725359E-4,2.506116147019668E-4,2.5061069844103863E-4,2.508361608610073E-4,2.5063580707447916E-4,2.5063618639005236E-4,2.5079674661457335E-4,2.506117051038867E-4,2.508531250049422E-4,2.5067441971278985E-4,2.505856453001278E-4,2.506992501229477E-4,2.507757671478341E-4,2.506370364836774E-4,2.507712722224066E-4,2.508943946566081E-4,2.511272635582012E-4,2.5067398654034516E-4,2.505985253806876E-4,2.5068888030138376E-4,2.506239760011384E-4,2.505478097371295E-4,2.5061153709162804E-4,2.5086269267877016E-4,2.507250787007573E-4,2.507718436869291E-4,2.505602794736536E-4,2.5061160081579325E-4,2.5059843114607396E-4,2.506832564429228E-4,2.507267252329181E-4,2.506757413701449E-4,2.5063600882225655E-4,2.5059905085673804E-4,2.511124876152884E-4,2.5066210879661795E-4,2.506115433759325E-4,2.506607664081854E-4,2.50585901683308E-4,0.9801944567830383,2.5062499726867695E-4,2.505994026657309E-4,2.5058575864248493E-4,2.507862332604839E-4,2.506855613798025E-4,2.5058565389105816E-4,2.505601773897299E-4,2.5053498079616126E-4,2.507615040780929E-4,2.505979299011483E-4,2.5071184239933186E-4,2.507854199692583E-4,2.5067164350437717E-4,2.5061187530261975E-4,2.50560505857426E-4,2.506246038642505E-4,2.505603709024343E-4,2.5057351990548154E-4,2.505605129489128E-4,2.5072316173520927E-4,2.506485384985987E-4,2.505859883584061E-4,2.5061026230912794E-4]}}

{"value":"This was just horrible the plot was just OK, but the rest of the was was bad . I mean come on puppet and then they even tried to make the movie digital and that made it even worse! Normally I would like low-budget movie but this was just a waste of time and almost made me want to return the set that it came on. I have about ten low-budget movie set with like 6-8 movies on them and I would have to say this is the worse movie out of all of them. Also the wording is off and they use a fake plastic machetes that doesn't even look like a real one, they could of used one that looked even a little close to a real one so save your time and money

{"value":"This comedy is really not funny. It' a romance that plays so much on stereotypes it makes no impact. It's a caper film so derivative -- yes, even back then -- it has no snap.<br /><br />The cast is adequate. More than that it's hard to say. However, what's nice is that the players are unfamiliar. At MGM, this would have starred Robert Montgomery. The wife of a businessman with no time for anything but work could have been any number of actresses.<br /><br />We can be grateful that this little known film is peopled by performers mostly unknown today. And the production values aren't awful. Yet it makes no real impression.<br /><br />It's a generic knockoff.

{"value":"When I first saw the cover of this movie (a giant bug chasing a few nurses) And the name \"Blue Monkey\", I knew I wasn't in for any big Hollywood movie. I was pleasantly surprised to see Steve Railsback in this cheese-ball flick, who always does a good job in whatever role he tackles.... The FX are pretty corny, there isn't too much of a plot, and I'm still not sure why this movie is called Blue Monkey, because there is nothing in this movie to do with monkey.

{"value":"Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90's art-house style that was considered \"old\" and out-of-date a few years ago. The cheesy cuts and effects were painful to watch. The script is decent enough, and a few scenes did kind of captivate me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). But the story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just plain terrible. The performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair's married boyfriend seriously bothered me. I did sit through the whole thing, though, which is rare for the kind of random, what-is-this movie you just find on TV and decide to watch.","finished_norm":["despit","be","a","movi","the","direct","be","the","kind","of","arthous","styl","that","be","consid","old","and","outofd","a","few","year","ago","the","cheesi","cut","and","effect","be","pain","to","watch","the","script","be","decent","enough","and","a","few","scene","do","kind","of","captiv","me","like","when","the","taxi","driver","bring","her","to","the","bridg","at","night","but","the","stori","line","with","the","detect","who","sister","kill","herself","and","how","he","be","obsess","with","suicid","be","just","plain","terribl","the","perform","by","the","actor","who","plai","selma","blair","marri","boyfriend","serious","bother","me","i","do","sit","through","the","whole","thing","though","which","be","rare","for","the","kind","of","random","whatisthi","movi","you","just","find","on","tv","and","decid","to","watch"],"filtered":["despit","movi","direct","kind","arthous","styl","consid","old","outofd","year","ago","cheesi","cut","effect","pain","watch","script","decent","enough","scene","kind","captiv","like","taxi","driver","bring","bridg","night","stori","line","detect","sister","kill","obsess","suicid","plain","terribl","perform","actor","plai","selma","blair","marri","boyfriend","serious","bother","sit","whole","thing","though","rare","kind","random","whatisthi","movi","find","tv","decid","watch"],"filtered2":["despit","direct","kind","arthous","styl","consid","old","outofd","year","ago","cheesi","cut","effect","pain","watch","script","decent","enough","scene","kind","captiv","like","taxi","driver","bring","bridg","night","stori","line","detect","sister","kill","obsess","suicid","plain","terribl","perform","actor","plai","selma","blair","marri","boyfriend","serious","bother","sit","whole","thing","though","rare","kind","random","whatisthi","find","tv","decid","watch"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,17,19,29,38,40,41,57,67,76,77,86,93,102,105,106,107,111,122,166,172,210,244,249,250,303,309,317,371,380,391,458,496,543,585,586,610,733,859,1013,1050,1062,1122,1373,1735,1855,2151,2680,2952,4368,7110],"values":[1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,7,17,19,29,38,40,41,57,67,76,77,86,93,102,105,106,107,111,122,166,172,210,244,249,250,303,309,317,371,380,391,458,496,543,585,586,610,733,859,1013,1050,1062,1122,1373,1735,1855,2151,2680,2952,4368,7110],"values":[0.6460382945576578,1.9218995441445863,1.2770536940105968,1.312380678011735,1.3195384777338066,1.519311641348122,1.6284968758320737,1.5687599167621034,1.834162586674748,1.9570915389266579,2.1337665533324026,1.9463902258768238,2.031112399272319,2.035389827120098,2.087553710177271,2.1765612129984904,2.159084361316692,2.1439533986393955,2.1183455303375887,6.746804302119746,2.4423870329693536,2.5001408943598484,2.687151791517189,2.634508058031767,2.6754694156628323,2.6812935439488212,2.868298950055202,2.848772527704847,2.8529247828056143,3.0466846007279185,3.102062070196872,3.109204957709252,3.2829611516442836,3.293679367864308,3.477726550625732,3.7165362186843414,3.4572130107926293,3.477726550625732,3.7636829971100436,3.9405024767500145,4.039936373738201,4.240607069200353,4.327618446189983,4.263079925052412,4.456830177669989,4.911775343041523,5.0768550934009715,5.143104478942172,5.3064295350454715,5.541743621979936,6.0662680901040895,6.868614562629026]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.194497759780533E-4,2.1925531043720574E-4,2.1930944626706011E-4,2.1926535805328167E-4,2.1928610891855578E-4,2.1925410152956945E-4,2.1932229259911829E-4,2.1922148009526627E-4,2.192553567745742E-4,2.194819334272076E-4,2.2122345868647684E-4,2.1925571892772572E-4,2.1946336794909384E-4,2.1948623224568836E-4,2.1938652538130743E-4,2.192662217077917E-4,2.1934165776813373E-4,2.1944488069798156E-4,2.192775414774104E-4,2.1927673977696274E-4,2.194740125378644E-4,2.1929870906764085E-4,2.19299040957232E-4,2.1943952627086715E-4,2.1927762057634103E-4,2.1948885564790834E-4,2.1933249395190803E-4,2.1925481904056052E-4,2.1935421980567488E-4,2.1942116987547997E-4,2.1929978476330155E-4,2.1941723695242675E-4,2.1952496533805853E-4,2.19728718545142E-4,2.193321149391922E-4,2.192660887193523E-4,2.1934514652716464E-4,2.1928835723826422E-4,2.192217140735599E-4,2.1927747357072412E-4,2.1949722707154386E-4,2.1937681902578165E-4,2.1941773696650504E-4,2.192326247137995E-4,2.1927752932743077E-4,2.1926600626693117E-4,2.1934022582203932E-4,2.193782596913494E-4,2.1933365036190064E-4,2.1929888559081069E-4,2.1926654849491612E-4,2.197157900444466E-4,2.1932172227464672E-4,2.1927747906929943E-4,2.1932054772559178E-4,2.192550433680463E-4,0.9826707519944572,2.1928925081630247E-4,2.1926685631708595E-4,2.1925491821167615E-4,2.1943032740576204E-4,2.1934224257171326E-4,2.1925482655736335E-4,2.1923253539347075E-4,2.192104891403555E-4,2.194086901232127E-4,2.19

{"value":"The last couple of weeks in the life of a dead vagabond woman is told in flashbacks. Like the vagabond, the film wanders aimlessly and rather pointlessly. Mona, the lazy, sullen, and drug-addicted title character, is not likable and Bonnaire does little to make her interesting. Although there is some pretentious dialog attempting to explain why Mona has chosen this miserable lifestyle, her motivations are never really clear. The episodic nature of the film, involving some random characters, becomes tiresome after a while, making it seem much longer than its running time.

Bad acting, bad directing, horrible (but I mean really horrible) script, and complete lack of an idea as to what entertainment (of any form) is. I bought the DVD for 3 dollars, I swear I could almost pay someone to take it. Burning it would not be enough for what this movie did to me. I like b-movies, the killer toys, the weird lagoon monsters, but this is nowhere near. You know those movies that are so bad they are funny? Not even. Just plain old pathetic.","finished_norm":["thi","be","complet","and","absolut","garbag","a","fine","exampl","of","what","a","bad","movi","be","like","thi","ca","not","be","appeal","to","anyon","not","even","bmovi","fan","do","not","i","repeat","do","not","wast","preciou","time","of","your","life","on","thi","piec","of","trash","bad","act","bad","direct","horribl","but","i","mean","realli","horribl","script","and","complet","lack","of","a","idea","a","to","what","entertain","of","ani","form","be","i","bui","the","dvd","for","dollar","i","swear","i","can","almost","pai","someon","to","take","it","burn","it","would","not","be","enough","for","what","thi","movi","do","to","me","i","like","bmovi","the","killer","toi","the","weird","lagoon","monster","but","thi","be","nowher","near","you","know","that","movi","that","be","so","bad","thei","be","funni","not","even","just","plain","old","pathet"],"filtered":["thi","complet","absolut","garbag","fine","exampl","bad","movi","like","thi","ca","appeal","anyon","even","bmovi","fan","repeat","wast","preciou","time","life","thi","piec","trash","bad","act","bad","direct","horribl","mean","realli","horribl","script","complet","lack","idea","entertain","ani","form","bui","dvd","dollar","swear","almost","pai","someon","take","burn","enough","thi","movi","like","bmovi","killer","toi","weird","lagoon","monster","thi","nowher","near","know","movi","bad","thei","funni","even","plain","old","pathet"],"filtered2":["complet","absolut","garbag","fine","exampl","bad","like","ca","appeal","anyon","even","bmovi","fan","repeat","wast","preciou","time","life","piec","trash","bad","act","bad","direct","horribl","mean","realli","horribl","script","complet","lack","idea","entertain","ani","form","bui","dvd","dollar","swear","almost","pai","someon","take","burn","enough","like","bmovi","killer","toi","weird","lagoon","monster","nowher","near","know","bad","funni","even","plain","old","pathet"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,8,9,13,21,26,27,31,62,67,75,77,81,88,89,93,102,103,123,131,139,140,158,183,195,218,222,230,247,252,307,322,347,413,464,555,586,602,625,671,689,690,702,799,862,986,1038,1286,1412,1597,2530],"values":[2.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,5,8,9,13,21,26,27,31,62,67,75,77,81,88,89,93,102,103,123,131,139,140,158,183,195,218,222,230,247,252,307,322,347,413,464,555,586,602,625,671,689,690,702,799,862,986,1038,1286,1412,1597,2530],"values":[1.2920765891153156,1.852034211452262,0.9418936859054116,4.273428342688829,1.1317941569733974,1.162015545335049,1.3324924169710188,1.3002700588679295,1.4070669811451506,2.0226120445069267,1.9570915389266579,1.9742250248702675,1.9463902258768238,1.949757232424728,2.0317223413467334,1.9940046109572438,2.035389827120098,2.087553710177271,4.197164082437498,2.2619070973220485,2.2512118082053005,2.2939035841256437,2.317169775997098,2.3106972614914807,2.4885128563647294,2.51289241584188,2.5940874818617203,2.5771019354959765,5.424276438599839,2.7303758068497004,3.0433232530252132,2.8767855639325206,2.885344817328191,3.0151989841543516,3.467417180966871,3.2872346624216657,3.432149042129413,3.4572130107926293,3.506637894120152,3.6194333882654965,3.6466665387238555,3.607563812710113,3.634471265630037,3.6466665387238555,3.7636829971100436,3.944626193933877,4.039936373738201,4.145296889396028,8.998179973919743,4.605250182788262,4.646072177308517,5.156897801074508]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.0145807199875926E-4,2.0127954981638408E-4,2.0132924729208168E-4,2.0128877367343208E-4,2.0130782326822797E-4,2.0127844002166886E-4,2.0134104041092703E-4,2.012484930726175E-4,2.012795923547593E-4,2.0148759300272543E-4,2.030863384081644E-4,2.012799248165964E-4,2.0147054962498732E-4,2.0149153938033801E-4,2.0140000703507268E-4,2.0128956652077807E-4,2.0135881791649246E-4,2.0145357806076935E-4,2.0129995823319922E-4,2.0129922226057962E-4,2.0148032151161323E-4,2.0131939038753926E-4,2.013196950669897E-4,2.0144866261914576E-4,2.0130003084716295E-4,2.0149394770156305E-4,2.0135040540050447E-4,2.012790987071483E-4,2.0137035004885457E-4,2.014318111823782E-4,2.0132037789173193E-4,2.014282007020663E-4,2.0152709691999222E-4,2.017141453144581E-4,2.0135005746134318E-4,2.0128944443546505E-4,2.0136202064780035E-4,2.0130988725827617E-4,2.0124870786807908E-4,2.0129989589387796E-4,2.0150163278967936E-4,2.0139109646015116E-4,2.014286597222304E-4,2.01258723993806E-4,2.0129994707934203E-4,2.0128936874294853E-4,2.013575033692431E-4,2.0139241901200332E-4,2.0135146700162257E-4,2.0131955243836522E-4,2.012898665160902E-4,2.01702276763614E-4,2.013405168448038E-4,2.012999009416497E-4,2.013394385917638E-4,2.0127930464302853E-4,0.9840914994019674,2.013107075758544E-4,2.0129014910129941E-4,2.0127918974766843E-4,2.0144021792777893E-4,2.0135935477464648E-4,2.0127910560768214E

{"value":"I didn't enjoy this film. I thought the acting wasn't very good and the story was boring. A 20year old computer saving the day? I thought that this was just slightly far fetched, even for a film. I couldn't figure out why they couldn't just turn it off, why not take a sledgehammer to it.<br /><br />Its a shame, but after the original film from the 80s you expected so much more than what was actually delivered. This film could have been a 21st century version of the old film, it wasn't.

{"value":"The action in this movie beats Sunny bhai in Gadar. Akshay Kumar possess the superpowers of Leonidus in 300, Neo in Matrix along with Spiderman and Superman. It is hilarious. Except for the typical Akshay Kumar and Anil Kapoor comedy I cannot see anything positive in this film. The story looks like the writer told his 10yr old son to write. The movie is so unreal that Anil Kapoors long range shooting with a shotgun is the least most mistake by the director. Except for the directors Tashan to make this movie there is no other Tashan. I regret wasting my money on this movie and I would not recommend it to anybody. 1/10 is the least I can give on IMDb or I would give it a zero.","finished_norm":["the","action","in","thi","movi","beat","sunni","bhai","in","gadar","akshai","kumar","possess","the","superpow","of","leonidu","in","neo","in","matrix","along","with","spiderman","and","superman","it","be","hilari","except","for","the","typic","akshai","kumar","and","anil","kapoor","comedi","i","cannot","see","anyth","posit","in","thi","film","the","stori","look","like","the","writer","tell","hi","yr","old","son","to","write","the","movi","be","so","unreal","that","anil","kapoor","long","rang","shoot","with","a","shotgun","be","the","littl","much","mistak","by","the","director","except","for","the","director","tashan","to","make","thi","movi","there","be","no","other","tashan","i","regret","wast","my","monei","on","thi","movi","and","i","would","not","recommend","it","to","anybodi","be","the","littl","i","can","give","on","imdb","or","i","would","give","it","a","zero"],"filtered":["action","thi","movi","beat","sunni","bhai","gadar","akshai","kumar","possess","superpow","leonidu","neo","matrix","along","spiderman","superman","hilari","except","typic","akshai","kumar","anil","kapoor","comedi","see","anyth","posit","thi","film","stori","look","like","writer","tell","hi","yr","old","son","write","movi","unreal","anil","kapoor","long","rang","shoot","shotgun","littl","much","mistak","director","except","director","tashan","make","thi","movi","tashan","regret","wast","monei","thi","movi","recommend","anybodi","littl","give","imdb","give","zero"],"filtered2":["action","beat","sunni","bhai","gadar","akshai","kumar","possess","superpow","leonidu","neo","matrix","along","spiderman","superman","hilari","except","typic","akshai","kumar","anil","kapoor","comedi","see","anyth","posit","stori","look","like","writer","tell","yr","old","son","write","unreal","anil","kapoor","long","rang","shoot","shotgun","littl","mistak","director","except","director","tashan","make","tashan","regret","wast","monei","recommend","anybodi","littl","give","imdb","give","zero"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,14,16,17,30,58,65,67,89,90,99,104,117,126,127,129,232,287,298,324,434,509,591,592,613,632,678,964,1168,1209,1305,1554,1678,1858,2632,2759,3035,3202,3422,3578,3580,3600,4887,5004,6632,7206],"values":[1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[0,1,2,14,16,17,30,58,65,67,89,90,99,104,117,126,127,129,232,287,298,324,434,509,591,592,613,632,678,964,1168,1209,1305,1554,1678,1858,2632,2759,3035,3202,3422,3578,3580,3600,4887,5004,6632,7206],"values":[0.6199767156205233,0.6460382945576578,0.6557002054693947,2.2350163994518417,1.1966138720291084,1.2770536940105968,2.6728839783437044,3.731402629253362,1.9073850067444174,1.9570915389266579,1.9940046109572438,2.0477128419653545,2.056430207256609,2.0728240170322856,2.2797301185117202,2.2391270689902285,2.4359679371086367,2.4106958340079214,5.220555595469753,2.841890188081905,2.7819920465008363,2.8753661172782943,3.4101163271295305,3.360519385990158,3.509308122676031,3.5227672760500357,3.5364100524538222,3.541919708264792,3.6715125373103863,4.062925891962901,5.390512652256013,4.3095999406873045,4.4637506205145625,4.589376833631972,4.679973728984199,5.170884043049248,11.645292014892677,11.591955520728355,5.482320201509136,11.999153431210834,11.814406790948803,13.451027437976705,5.719991853386255,5.9370563586240825,6.437831646536572,6.868614562629026,6.794506590475304,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1188076479612995E-4,2.1169300653874447E-4,2.1174527517734887E-4,2.1170270760391554E-4,2.117227427540307E-4,2.1169183932737045E-4,2.1175767842838514E-4,2.116603430343435E-4,2.116930512778973E-4,2.1191181310725415E-4,2.13593271665146E-4,2.1169340094007568E-4,2.118938879684199E-4,2.1191596365579478E-4,2.1181969576676958E-4,2.1170354147024003E-4,2.117763756760953E-4,2.1187603835847073E-4,2.1171447081128598E-4,2.117136967621751E-4,2.1190416541618486E-4,2.11734908313156E-4,2.1173522875559019E-4,2.1187086861014452E-4,2.1171454718202663E-4,2.1191849657461987E-4,2.1176752792775882E-4,2.1169253209079144E-4,2.1178850443817653E-4,2.118531453425941E-4,2.117359469071498E-4,2.1184934806943358E-4,2.1195336081055482E-4,2.121500863945938E-4,2.1176716198751695E-4,2.1170341306868612E-4,2.1177974410483194E-4,2.117249135272621E-4,2.116605689425249E-4,2.1171440524675965E-4,2.1192657926066692E-4,2.1181032419177926E-4,2.1184983083759703E-4,2.116711032654153E-4,2.117144590803696E-4,2.1170333346011975E-4,2.1177499311905108E-4,2.1181171516755472E-4,2.1176864445217794E-4,2.1173507874789013E-4,2.1170385698619597E-4,2.1213760380898718E-4,2.1175712777489426E-4,2.117144105556844E-4,2.1175599373704463E-4,2.116927486810296E-4,0.9832684526361812,2.1172577628502667E-4,2.1170415419131489E-4,2.116926278414101E-4,2.1186198702179455E-4,2.117769403092973E-4,2.1169253934833325E-4,2.11671

Not grandiose and epic like the entire run of the show has been. Most reviews have read have been glowing but I really can't understand why. I had seriously predicted that general ending WAY earlier on but then retracted it because I thought \"No, they would never do that, that's FAR too lame.\" I can hardly stand it. I feel so unsatisfied. I think i'm about to walk out the door to go sell every season I own. Someone please. Change my mind. I want to love this. SO bad. Someone tell me why I'm wrong. Great show.

What is wrong with these people. I'm not angry at Rob Schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat. I watched this film in disbelief. Who would pay money to make this?? This film is so bad that its painful. Most bad films are funny because they are crap. The Animal is just DISGUSTING!!! Watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self. We don't need you. I want to raise money to get Rob Scheider off all movies. If someone killed Rob Schneider they should be given a Nobel peace

{"value":"In what I can say was a theft of my time I was taken to see this movie and I must say what a horrible experience. Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie. Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer. The plot is thin to say the least, the Cantonese dialog is not funny. See this movie at your peril.<br /><br />David Tang from Shanghai Tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate. The banal plot attempts to compete with other rom-coms out there, and just blends into the scenery. It was like watching paint dry. <br /><br />In short this movie was a total waste of time and space.

{"value":"I went to the movie as a Sneak Preview in Austria. So didn't have an idea what I am going to see. The story is very normal. The movie is very long , I believe it could have cut to 1/2 without causing any problems to the story. Its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more ! Ashton Kutcher was very good . Kevin Costner is OK. The movie is speaking about the US Coast Guards, how they are trained , their life style and the problems they face. As there aren't much effects in the movie. So if you want to watch it , then no need to waste your money and time going to the Cinema. Would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on DVDs.","finished_norm":["i","go","to","the","movi","a","a","sneak","preview","in","austria","so","do","not","have","a","idea","what","i","be","go","to","see","the","stori","be","veri","normal","the","movi","be","veri","long","i","believ","it","can","have","cut","to","without","caus","ani","problem","to","the","stori","it","the","typ","of","movi","you","can","see","in","a","bore","night","which","you","want","to","get","bore","much","ashton","kutcher","be","veri","good","kevin","costner","be","okai","the","movi","be","speak","about","the","u","coast","guard","how","thei","be","train","their","life","styl","and","the","problem","thei","face","a","there","be","not","much","effect","in","the","movi","so","if","you","want","to","watch","it","then","no","ne","to","wast","your","monei","and","time","go","to","the","cinema","would","be","much","effect","to","watch","it","at","home","when","it","get","on","dvd"],"filtered":["go","movi","sneak","preview","austria","idea","go","see","stori","veri","normal","movi","veri","long","believ","cut","without","caus","ani","problem","stori","typ","movi","see","bore","night","want","get","bore","much","ashton","kutcher","veri","good","kevin","costner","okai","movi","speak","u","coast","guard","thei","train","life","styl","problem","thei","face","much","effect","movi","want","watch","ne","wast","monei","time","go","cinema","much","effect","watch","home","get","dvd"],"filtered2":["go","sneak","preview","austria","idea","go","see","stori","veri","normal","veri","long","believ","cut","without","caus","ani","problem","stori","typ","see","bore","night","want","get","bore","ashton","kutcher","veri","good","kevin","costner","okai","speak","u","coast","guard","train","life","styl","problem","face","effect","want","watch","ne","wast","monei","time","go","cinema","effect","watch","home","get","dvd"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,7,8,15,17,27,37,75,89,91,99,106,108,110,112,123,125,126,167,191,210,247,251,302,303,344,380,384,409,452,700,713,1491,1592,1974,2365,3489,5512],"values":[2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[2,3,4,6,7,8,15,17,27,37,75,89,91,99,106,108,110,112,123,125,126,167,191,210,247,251,302,303,344,380,384,409,452,700,713,1491,1592,1974,2365,3489,5512],"values":[1.3114004109387893,0.6786144649922705,1.5932680941439847,2.912480743411154,1.9218995441445863,0.9418936859054116,3.6001823395697077,2.5541073880211935,1.3002700588679295,2.975308642954861,1.9742250248702675,1.9940046109572438,2.0105926690411424,2.056430207256609,4.318168722633384,4.277015007255866,2.1290479736304078,2.2466628996789315,2.2619070973220485,2.2242236634876535,2.2391270689902285,4.9219153375776195,2.5460113484259455,2.687151791517189,2.7303758068497004,2.6942272927333892,2.902686292364678,2.868298950055202,2.983093497946387,3.102062070196872,3.109204957709252,3.2209578243390444,3.2872346624216657,3.616452760127359,3.865219416329466,4.679973728984199,4.733083554298147,4.9909126636002465,5.170884043049248,5.770002273960917,6.725513718988353]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.2757959611255737E-4,2.2737792632708298E-4,2.274340676935463E-4,2.2738834617097784E-4,2.274098657807246E-4,2.2737667263379312E-4,2.2744738993572355E-4,2.2734284269338765E-4,2.2737797438108327E-4,2.2761294487884308E-4,2.294189873473665E-4,2.273783499506986E-4,2.2759369161694324E-4,2.2761740295299356E-4,2.2751400231007046E-4,2.2738924182076238E-4,2.2746747251417934E-4,2.2757451948007224E-4,2.2740098094688554E-4,2.2740014954633723E-4,2.2760473054921095E-4,2.274229327197404E-4,2.2742327690463999E-4,2.275689666908079E-4,2.2740106297614536E-4,2.2762012354277317E-4,2.274579692117212E-4,2.2737741672597015E-4,2.2748049992975643E-4,2.275499302573931E-4,2.27424048266033E-4,2.275458516337718E-4,2.2765757096628272E-4,2.278688724924202E-4,2.2745757615795566E-4,2.2738910390558253E-4,2.274710905191085E-4,2.2741219739254285E-4,2.2734308533973042E-4,2.2740091052450228E-4,2.276288050973629E-4,2.2750393636919428E-4,2.2754637017156242E-4,2.2735440017971142E-4,2.2740096834679316E-4,2.2738901839859752E-4,2.2746598751966353E-4,2.2750543040620834E-4,2.2745916846251963E-4,2.2742311578245497E-4,2.2738958071416728E-4,2.2785546503755505E-4,2.27446798482794E-4,2.274009162267799E-4,2.274455804209466E-4,2.2737764936397754E-4,0.9820287660606672,2.2741312407441409E-4,2.273898999400347E-4,2.2737751957101673E-4,2.2755942704103617E-4,2.2746807898261544E-4,2.2737742452124331E-4,2.273543075503877E-4,2.2733144456336753E-4,2.2753698817546157E-4,2.2738856357694878E-4,2.2749192596045148E-4,2.2755868907355325E-4,2.2745545012449892E-4,2.274012174117604E-4,2.2735460559673477E-4,2.2741276710551387E-4,2.2735448314072836E-4,2.273664143363155E-4,2.273546120314368E-4,2.2750219694523907E-4,2.2743448501087057E-4,2.2737772801157874E-4,2.2739975380719945E-4]}}
{"value":"A shaky hand-held camera was used, presumably to give the film a documentary look, but the effect was so exaggerated that I started to get motion-sickness just from watching it. It looked like someone with cerebral palsy was holding the camera (no offense meant to CP sufferers, but I don't think you would expect to get much work as a cinematographer!) The camera work was so nauseating, and so distracting, that my wife and I considered it unwatchable and gave up on it after 10 minutes of torture. I checked back a while later (it was showing on TV), and it hadn't gotten any better. I suggest giving this one a miss unless you need to get rid of any bad sushi you may have eaten!","finished_norm":["a","shaki","handheld","camera","be","us","presum","to","give","the","film","a","documentari","look","but","the","effect","be","so","exagger","that","i","start","to","get","motionsick","just","from","watch","it","it","look","like","someon","with","cerebr","palsi","be","hold","the","camera","no","offens","mean","to","cp","suffer","but","i","do","not","think","you","would","expect","to","get","much","work","a","a","cinematograph","the","camera","work","be","so","nauseat","and","so","distract","that","my","wife","and","i","consid","it","unwatch","and","give","up","on","it","after","minut","of","tortur","i","check","back","a","while","late","it","be","show","on","tv","and","it","have","not","get","ani","well","i","suggest","give","thi","on","a","miss","unless","you","ne","to","get","rid","of","ani","bad","sushi","you","mai","have","eat"],"filtered":["shaki","handheld","camera","us","presum","give","film","documentari","look","effect","exagger","start","get","motionsick","watch","look","like","someon","cerebr","palsi","hold","camera","offens","mean","cp","suffer","think","expect","get","much","work","cinematograph","camera","work","nauseat","distract","wife","consid","unwatch","give","minut","tortur","check","back","late","show","tv","get","ani","well","suggest","give","thi","miss","unless","ne","get","rid","ani","bad","sushi","mai","eat"],"filtered2":["shaki","handheld","camera","us","presum","give","documentari","look","effect","exagger","start","get","motionsick","watch","look","like","someon","cerebr","palsi","hold","camera","offens","mean","cp","suffer","think","expect","get","work","cinematograph","camera","work","nauseat","distract","wife","consid","unwatch","give","minut","tortur","check","back","late","show","tv","get","ani","well","suggest","give","miss","unless","ne","get","rid","ani","bad","sushi","mai","eat"],"features":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,9,12,16,20,27,28,30,46,48,56,59,63,71,88,106,110,130,139,150,172,231,255,263,317,414,460,505,599,624,633,646,802,1145,1356,1607,1836,2046,2929,3077,3265,3589,4237,7432],"values":[1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0]},"IDFFeatures":{"type":0,"size":8625,"indices":[1,4,7,9,12,16,20,27,28,30,46,48,56,59,63,71,88,106,110,130,139,150,172,231,255,263,317,414,460,505,599,624,633,646,802,1145,1356,1607,1836,2046,2929,3077,3265,3589,4237,7432],"values":[0.6460382945576578,3.1865361882879695,0.9609497720722932,1.0683570856722073,1.066728610262888,2.393227744058217,1.165345040023057,2.600540117735859,1.5452294193519092,4.009325967515556,1.655771293751733,3.3910232448024944,1.8610609350701788,1.8693254449200722,1.8729627573220065,1.9214926742550966,2.0317223413467334,2.159084361316692,2.1290479736304078,2.2642139034199635,2.2939035841256437,2.332712011146513,2.5001408943598484,8.114805921017584,2.6754694156628323,2.902686292364678,2.8529247828056143,3.1254654785810323,3.216957819005698,3.41740676039221,3.6254214301101193,3.9241755834625858,3.550241531602284,3.5900195030592035,3.8883864756110005,4.2574141875167335,4.396611317676934,4.597282013139085,4.77960356993304,4.900964426937307,5.390512652256013,5.482320201509136,5.521540914662417,5.649374286172302,5.907203395474402,6.794506590475304]},"topicDistribution":{"type":1,"values":[2.1559885968247354E-4,2.1540780663323978E-4,2.1546099248468368E-4,2.1541767793321646E-4,2.1543806466120733E-4,2.1540661893957872E-4,2.1547361338862628E-4,2.15374569947933E-4,2.1540785215747764E-4,2.1563045283100633E-4,2.1734141771275777E-4,2.1540820795554644E-4,2.156122131408861E-4,2.156346762135926E-4,2.1553671901055043E-4,2.1541852643227138E-4,2.1549263873662985E-4,2.1559405030503585E-4,2.1542964756197307E-4,2.1542885992980736E-4,2.1562267093784896E-4,2.154504437022087E-4,2.154507697677837E-4,2.155887898376921E-4,2.154297252728715E-4,2.1563725358021146E-4,2.1548363572753679E-4,2.1540732385964893E-4,2.1550498033487067E-4,2.1557075556130373E-4,2.1545150052150493E-4,2.155668916533926E-4,2.1567272961560576E-4,2.158729073506162E-4,2.1548326336575616E-4,2.154183957775202E-4,2.1549606627473244E-4,2.154402735272824E-4,2.1537479982036318E-4,2.1542958084691695E-4,2.156454781016615E-4,2.1552718298266567E-4,2.1556738289319735E-4,2.1538551900010977E-4,2.1542963562520194E-4,2.154183147719785E-4,2.1549123191840134E-4,2.155285983673577E-4,2.1548477184478557E-4,2.1545061712774057E-4,2.1541884748491803E-4,2.15860205719936E-4,2.1547305307223876E-4,2.1542958624900296E-4,2.1547189913423287E-4,2.154075442506241E-4,0.9829748465565832,2.1544115142476593E-4,2.1541914990540813E-4,2.1540742129050455E-4,2.1557975239475924E-4,2.1549321327804519E-4,2.154073312445465E-4,2.153854312471789E-4,2.1536377186288135E-4,2.1555849480439047E-4,2.1541788389403292E-4,2.155158048517897E-4,2.155790532769538E-4,2.1548124925554264E-4,2.1542987157835346E-4,2.1538571360312672E-4,2.1544081324819322E-4,2.15385
